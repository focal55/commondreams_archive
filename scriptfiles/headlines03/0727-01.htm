<p>WASHINGTON  - The U.S. prison and jail population  increased to 2,033,331 people at the end of last year, holding  one out of every 143 residents, according to a Justice  Department report released on Sunday.<P>

</table>The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported a 3.7 percent  increase last year. The 2.6 percent rise in the prison  population alone represented the largest jump in three years,  equal to 700 inmates added every week during the year.<P>
Federal and state prisons generally hold people who have  been convicted of felony crimes while local jails generally  hold people awaiting trial or serving sentences for lesser  misdemeanor offenses.<P>
The <a href="http://www.justicepolicy.org/" target="_new">Justice Policy Institute</a>, which promotes alternatives  to prison, said the nation's use of incarceration is rising  again at a time when states can least afford it because of  budget shortfalls.
<P>
"The prison population and budget figures -- taken together  -- should be setting off alarm bells in state capitols," Jason  Ziedenberg, the institute's director of policy and research,  said.<P>
"As legislators are struggling to fund education, health  care and stave off spending cuts, many are continuing to choose  to pay for an expensive justice system that damages communities  and does not produce safe, healthy neighborhoods," he said in a  statement on the government's latest prisoner survey.<P>
The report found that black males from 20 to 39 years old  accounted for about a third of all sentenced prison inmates  under state or federal jurisdiction at the end of December.<P>
It said more than 10 percent of the country's black male  population between the ages of 25 to 29 were in prison,  compared to 2.4 percent of Hispanic males and 1.2 percent of  white males in the same age group.
<P>
Among the report's other findings:
<P>
  <ul>
    <li>There were 97,491 women in federal or state prison at  the end of last year, accounting for nearly 7 percent of all  prison inmates. Since 1995, the number of female prisoners has  grown 42 percent while the number of male prisoners has  increased 27 percent.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Seventeen states reported increases of at least 5  percent in their prison populations during 2002 while nine  states had decreases.<br>
    </li>
    <li>About half of all state prisoners were serving time for  violent crimes.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Growth in the federal prison system since 1995 mainly  reflected more incarcerated drug offenders, accounting for  nearly half of the total increase, and immigration offenders,  accounting for more than 20 percent of the rise.</li>
