<p>Long before mad cow disease appeared in Washington, the federal government slammed the Food and Drug Administration for failing to adequately enforce feed regulations, a key piece of the nation's firewall against the disease.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the FDA tried to reassure the public by saying it has "vigorously enforced" a 1997 law that bans the use of meat and bone meal from dead ruminants (cows, sheep and goats) in feed for live ruminants. The agency said more than 99 percent of feed operators are now complying with the law.</p>
<p>But in January 2002, the General Accounting Office -- Congress' investigative arm -- criticized the FDA for failing to adequately enforce the feed ban. </p>
<p>It said the agency had failed to issue warning letters to violators and inspection records were incomplete, inconsistent, inaccurate and untimely. The FDA's records, investigators said, were "so severely flawed" that they shouldn't be used to assess compliance. </p>
<p>"FDA has not placed a priority on oversight of the feed ban," the report said.</p>
<p>As investigators track how the Holstein from Mabton became sick, environmental advocates say it's important to look at previous violations at feed mills, renderers and related companies, because the incubation period for the disease is up to four years.</p>
<p>In Washington, more than a dozen companies were "potential violators" of the feed ban from 1998 to 2002, according to Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy group. The group said it based its assertion on a 2002 spreadsheet on the FDA's Web site. </p>
<p>"At the very time that cow was starting to eat, there were many more violators than we have today," said Larry Bohlen, director of the group's health and environment programs. </p>
<p>"So the FDA needs to lift every stone. Did places buy feed from any of these violators? Did other farms or ranchers buy from any of these violators?" </p>
<p>The FDA has said it cited three Washington companies in 2002, including Tacoma-based X-Cel Feeds Inc., a feed mill with a long history of violations. </p>
<p>Yesterday, the company's lawyer, Paul Alvestad, said it has not sold any cattle feed to the Sunny Dene Ranch, where the sick cow last lived.</p>
<p>He said the company sells to farms in Western Washington and overseas. </p>
<p>It does not sell cattle feed to farms in the Yakima area or Canada.</p>
<p>The FDA  reached a consent decree with the company in July after citing it for failing to adequately clean its equipment, among other violations. </p>
<p>"We were cleaning the equipment, but it wasn't up to what the FDA wanted," Alvestad said.</p>
<p>X-Cel never mixed mammalian tissue with cattle feed, he said. After the 2002 citation, the company voluntarily stopped mixing mammalian tissue in any of its feed -- even for animals allowed to consume it, he said. He added that previous FDA warnings received by the company, dating as far back as 1989, were not related to violations of the mad cow law but to other issues, such as the manner in which X-Cel weighed ingredients.</p>
<p>According to Friends of the Earth, eight Washington companies did not have required warning labels. </p>
<p>Ten companies that handle feed prohibited for cattle had faulty record-keeping, the group said. </p>
<p>Twelve companies that handle feed for both cattle and other animals need "special attention," Friends of the Earth said. That's because the FDA's category of whether the companies had a system to prevent the inadvertent mingling of feed was left blank. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the FDA said she was not familiar with the group's data. </p>
<p>In one case, a pet-food salvager in Oroville in 1999 did not put warning labels on food for pets as required by the FDA, according to Friends of the Earth. A man at the company, which buys broken bags of cat and dog food and resells them, said the company had not known about the warning labels. The company also sells 50-pound bags of a corn, oats and barley blend intended for cattle. </p>
<p>"We were totally unaware we were doing anything wrong," said the man, who didn't want to be named. </p>
<p>Now, the company's 10- to 15-pound bags of pet food carry the warning: "Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lawrence Dyckman, one of the GAO report's main authors, said his agency is working on a follow-up report about enforcement of the feed ban, due in spring.</p>
<p>The original report said the FDA had found hundreds of firms out of compliance, mostly for failing to properly label feed or for including prohibited proteins in cattle feed. But it had sent out only two warning letters. </p>
<p>The FDA spokeswoman said yesterday the agency was already addressing the GAO's concerns by the time the report came out.</p>
