<p>RAMALLAH, West Bank  - 



Palestinian President

Yasser Arafat offered condolences on Saturday to the families

of seven astronauts -- one of them an Israeli fighter pilot --

killed in the break-up of the space shuttle Columbia.



  <p>

 "President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority  offer their

condolences to the six American families and the Israeli family

who lost their loved ones in the catastrophe," Saeb Erekat, a

senior Palestinian official and spokesman, told Reuters.  

  <p>

 Israeli Air Force Colonel Ilan Ramon was part of Columbia's

seven-member science mission which took off on January 16,

briefly restoring a sense of celebration and pride to a country

mired in more than two years of conflict with the Palestinians.  

  <p>

 His participation in the mission drew tepid reactions among

Palestinians, whose uprising for independence in the occupied

West Bank and Gaza Strip  has often been met with Israeli air

strikes.  

  <p>

 Erekat said Arafat had sent President Bush  a message of

condolences over the loss of the NASA  space agency's shuttle.

The United States, Israel's closest ally, is the chief Middle

East peace broker.
