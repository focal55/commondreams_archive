<p>TEN million people are expected to join a worldwide protest next month against war on Iraq.</p> <p>Peace activists are organizing marches across Europe, America and the Middle East in what could be the biggest demo ever staged.</p> 

<p>The day of action is planned for Saturday, February 15, and is described by campaigners as "the last chance to stop the war".</p> <p>The day of action was unveiled as President Bush reaffirmed his determination to invade Iraq.</p> <p>Speaking at his ranch in Texas yesterday he warned Saddam Hussein: "Your day of reckoning is coming."</p> <p>As 15,000 US troops prepared to head for the Gulf, he accused Saddam of lying and said it was unlikely he would disarm peacefully.</p> <p>He added: "For 11 long years the world has dealt with him. Hopefully, he now realizes we are serious. It's his choice."</p> 

<p>Britain's <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/" target="_new">Stop The War Coalition</a> reckons at least 500,000 and perhaps as many as a million will turn up for a rally in Hyde Park, London.</p> 

<p>Spokesman Andrew Burgin said: "The worldwide event will demonstrate the feelings of millions of ordinary men and women.</p> <p>"It should send a clear signal to President Bush and Tony Blair that this war is wrong and unwanted. We hope we can spark something that will be a turning point." Representatives of anti-war groups in 11 European countries, including Italy, France, Spain and Germany, met in Copenhagen recently to co-ordinate the protest.</p> <p>American groups are planning marches in Washington, New York, San Francisco and other cities. Support has also been promised by peace movements in the Middle East.</p> <p>Mr Blair discussed Iraq and the Middle East peace process with King Abdullah of Jordan yesterday as he and Cherie broke into their Egyptian holiday for dinner at the royal palace.</p> <p>They flew from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik to the king's seaside residence at Aqaba. Jordan is seen as a key Western ally but, like other Arab states, it opposes an attack on Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>King Abdullah is believed to have warned Mr Blair that a war against Iraq could destabilize the entire region.</p>
