</table></font>Under the measure, the government would provide loan guarantees for at least a half dozen advanced design commercial nuclear power plants expected to cost about $3 billion each. The government would guarantee half the cost.</p>
    <p>An attempt to strip the loan guarantees from the Senate bill fell short Tuesday, 50-48. Critics called the government help a giveaway to a mature industry that should be left to succeed or fail on its own.</p>
    <p>The guarantees are part of a broader package of pro-nuclear measures in the bill, which may be approved within weeks, including a plan for the government to build a $1.1 billion reactor to make hydrogen and $865 million for research into reducing nuclear waste.</p>
    <p>The measure marks the most ambitious attempt to energize the nuclear industry in decades and goes much further to help nuclear power than House legislation passed in April.</p>
    <p>Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., architect of a package of pro-nuclear provisions, said the government help is needed sustain the role of nuclear power in the country's energy picture.</p>
    <p>No utility has tried to build a new power reactor since the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. Several companies have filed papers with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission declaring an interest in building a new-design reactor in the near future, probably at locations with an existing a nuclear power plant.</p>
    <p>Industry representatives have argued that the government safety net is needed at least for the first group of reactors now that the electric power industry is in transition from highly regulated to competitive markets.</p>
<p>"The time has come to quit playing around with energy and say, wherever we can, we are going to produce more energy," argued Domenici. Nuclear power has long been neglected, he said, and that has been "a giant mistake."</p>
    <p>He said that nuclear energy is "clean, affordable and reliable ... and offers a potential and promise for this country and the rest of the world that I believe we have never really tapped." The new reactors will be smaller, safer and more efficient than plants built in the past, he said.</p>
    <p>The legislation calls for supporting enough new reactors to produce 8,400 megawatts of power. That would be enough to build seven reactors similar in size to many of the large commercial power reactors now in operation, but could also be used to build more smaller reactors.</p>
    <p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who led the opposition to the loan guarantees, said it's "not a question about whether someone is pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear" but whether "to put at risk the taxpayers of this country" if the reactor projects flop.</p>
    <p>Sen. John Sununu, R-N.H., a co-sponsor with Wyden of the amendment to block the loan guarantees, said "power plants should be developed on a level playing field without government subsidizing one industry over another."</p>
    <p>They cited a 50 percent estimate by the Congressional Budget Office that reactor projects might default, leaving taxpayers left with a $16 billion bill - half the total cost of the construction loans.</p>
    <p>Industry representatives dispute the CBO analysis and contend private companies also would stand to lose billions of dollars and would not pursue the ventures unless they are shown to be viable.</p>
    <p>In addition to the loan guarantees, the energy bill calls for:</p>
    <p>- A requirement that the government purchase power from the new-generation reactors that would be built.</p>
    <p>-Construction of a $1.1 billion government-owned reactor in Idaho to produce hydrogen.</p>
    <p>-Authorization for an additional $865 million to speed research into ways to alter reactor waste chemically to reduce its volume and long-term radioactivity.</p>
    <p>-Increases in other nuclear research spending by tens of millions of dollars over current levels.</p>
    <p>Even without the loan guarantees, the measures amount to $3.7 billion in additional government support for the nuclear industry over five years, estimated the Taxpayers for Common Sense, a private advocacy group on tax issues. It called the bill "one of the largest corporate welfare handouts in our nation's history."</p>
