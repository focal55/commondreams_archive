</table></font>Bush, who faces a re-election fight in just over a year, saw his rating fell sharply from last month in a Zogby America poll of likely voters. Forty-five percent gave Bush positive marks for job performance in the new survey, down from 52 percent in August and the lowest since January 2001, the month he took office.

<p>In a Time magazine/CNN poll of registered voters, the president's approval slid to 52 percent. The same poll recorded 63 percent approval for Bush back in May.

<p>"The economy clearly is the chief concern," pollster John Zogby said, noting that recent surveys found more people fearful of losing their jobs within the next year.

<p>A Labor Department report Friday showed a weak labor market as initial claims for unemployment aid rose unexpectedly, even as other indicators showed the economy gaining strength.

<p>Iraq, where U.S. soldiers face daily attacks amid rebuilding attempts, has also hurt Bush's standing, Zogby said.

<p>Bush is scheduled to address the nation Sunday night about Iraq and the war on terrorism.

<p>"There is growing concern and impatience about whether the war was worth it," Zogby said.

<p>The Time/CNN poll, however, said 72 percent of people surveyed thought the United States had done a "good job" in Iraq since major fighting ended, and 63 percent believed going to war with Iraq was the right decision.

<p>The poll found a split on whether the war was worth the toll in American lives and other costs, with 49 percent saying yes and 43 percent saying no.

<p>The Zogby poll of 1,013 people was conducted Sept. 3-5. The margin of error was 3.2 percentage points. The Time/CNN poll was conducted Sept. 3-4 and surveyed 1,003 people. Its margin of error was 3.1 percentage points.
