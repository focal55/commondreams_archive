<p> Congress, with only a limited debate, has given the Bush 
administration a green light for the biggest revitalization of the country's 
nuclear weapons program since the end of the Cold War, leaving many Democrats 
and even some hawkish Republicans seething.
<P>

"This has been a good year," said Linton Brooks, the administrator of the 
National Nuclear Security Administration, which develops and manages the 
country's nuclear weapons arsenal. "I'm pretty happy we essentially got what 
we wanted." 
<P>Reversing a decade of restraint in nuclear weapons policy, Congress 
agreed to provide more than $6 billion for research, expansion and upgrades in 
the country's nuclear capabilities. While Congress approved large sums to 
maintain the existing nuclear arsenal even during the Clinton years, this 
year's increases will finance multiyear programs to design a new generation of 
warheads as well as more sophisticated missiles, bombers and re-entry vehicles 
to deliver them. 
<P>"This is a fairly radical new way of thinking about things," Brooks said, 
adding that it amounted to "a more fundamental shift in the way we look at 
this than many people realize."
<P>That the change is indeed both "radical" and "fundamental" is about the 
only thing critics of the administration agree with.
<P>"It hasn't been perceived as such, but this is a nuclear revival," said 
Stephen Schwartz, publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
<P>Deeply disturbing to critics on both sides of the political spectrum is 
how little public or congressional discussion has taken place, and how little 
detailed information the Bush administration has provided on its strategies 
and plans. 
<P>"I'm totally offended by this administration," said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-
Pa., a onetime White House ally on nuclear issues, and vice chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee. "I happen to think they're out of bounds on 
this. There's an important sea change in the world, and we have no idea what 
our policy is.
<P>"It's a major national scandal in the making," Weldon said in an 
interview with The Chronicle last week. "I'm totally frustrated."
<P>Yet for all their misgivings, influential Republicans like Weldon managed 
to impose only minuscule cuts of less than $20 million on the programs for new 
warhead development, leaving plans for jump-starting the U.S. nuclear arsenal 
and warhead production capabilities largely intact.
<P>"We know we're getting rolled," said Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, 
a vocal opponent of the new nuclear push. "All we did was give the president a 
sizable victory instead of a complete victory. They got everything they wanted 
as far as the significant issues. It is a huge ideological victory."
<P>"Nothing that happened in Congress stops (the Bush administration) from 
doing what they want to do at this point," said Robert Civiak, a nuclear 
physicist and former weapons analyst at the Office of Management of Budget. 
"The message that got across is that the country is ready for new kinds of 
nuclear weapons."
<P>Nuclear-weapons opponents argue that the country has little idea about 
the direction it is taking with such weapons of mass destruction.
<P>"There's no debate on this at all," said Andrew Lichterman, program 
director of the Oakland-based Western States Legal Foundation, a nonprofit 
group that favors arms reductions. "These programs are not being questioned in 
the political mainstream at all."
<P>The Bush administration has argued that the new doctrine and new weapons 
are needed because the world has changed since the Cold War, when the United 
States deterred the Soviet Union from striking by developing a massive arsenal 
that promised complete annihilation. Now, the administration argues, there are 
new, regional menaces from such countries as North Korea and Iran. 
<P>To deter those threats, the administration is seeking a new stockpile of 
both some Cold War-era warheads and new, smaller weapons that can be used for 
limited attacks and for destroying caches of weapons of mass destruction, 
especially in buried bunkers, without causing indiscriminate destruction and 
loss of life. It has also proposed a policy of possible pre-emptive first use 
of nuclear weapons in emergencies, even against non-nuclear states.
<P>A recent study entitled "Missiles of Empire: America's 21st Century 
Global Legions," by Lichterman of the Western States Legal Foundation 
highlights not only the administration's push for new kinds of warheads, but 
also the billions it is planning to spend on reducing the time it would take 
to launch a nuclear strike and on a new generation of missile re-entry 
vehicles, among other things. The re-entry vehicles would allow the military 
to steer warheads toward targets, even moving targets, entering the atmosphere 
from space.
<P><b>Even GOP hawks upset
</b>
<P>It is precisely those kinds of provocative new weapons capabilities  --  
at a time when the administration seeks to prevent proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction elsewhere  --  that worries even hawkish Republicans. 
<P>"We have more nuclear weapons now than we know what to do with,'' said 
Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's 
energy and water subcommittee, which controls the nuclear weapons budget. "I'm 
concerned about our image in the world when we're telling others not to build 
these things, and then we push these new programs."
<P>Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., a senior member of the Armed Services 
Committee who voted against funding some programs, argued in an interview, "We 
don't need new weapons, and in fact we cause more harm than good in our 
relations with other countries and in our moral position on nuclear 
proliferation. I think that they're almost obsolete. I'm not convinced that we 
have to have that capability."
<P>The Republican lawmakers conceded that their defiance had been more 
symbolic than substantive. Among other things, the administration succeeded in 
pushing through the repeal of the law banning the development of smaller, more 
usable low-yield warheads, and it got approval to begin research into advanced 
weapons concepts for the future. Congress also provided funding for study of a 
new "bunker-buster" warhead.
<P>A number of the new initiatives also bring the promise of increased 
spending in the future. For instance, Congress approved increasing the 
readiness of the Nevada Test Site, where weapons were tested underground until 
a ban was put in place in 1992. The NNSA has estimated it would cost as much 
as $83 million over three years to increase the level of readiness, and an 
additional $25 million to $30 million a year to sustain that level.
<P>Congress also approved with virtually no debate $320 million for 
manufacturing new "pits," the plutonium cores of warheads, almost $90 million 
more than last year. More than $135 million was appropriated for a program to 
keep tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the power of warheads, ready for 
weapons use and another $265 million for a broad campaign to refurbish the 
facilities used to produce and maintain the nuclear arsenal.
<P>Republicans acknowledged that the few cuts they did make were achieved in 
the face of intense White House pressure  --  and, as Brooks acknowledged, 
amounted to only "one-tenth of a percent of my budget." "I'm trying to send 
messages about priorities and what is important to the long-term future of 
this country," said Hobson. "We sent some messages, and the question will be 
whether they get them or not."
<P>The GOP critics, all advocates of a strong defense, also admitted that 
they did not attack the broader array of programs on the congressional floor.
<P>"I guess my feeling is that I would not want us to unilaterally disarm 
and get rid of our nuclear potential," said Hefley. "But at the same time I'm 
not comfortable with seeing us maintain all of the nuclear weapons arsenal. 
How can we in good conscience upgrade and develop new nuclear weapons?"
<P><b>'An insurance policy'
</b>
<P>Even Democrats who have been passionate in their criticisms of Bush's 
policies admitted that they felt they had to vote for the bulk of the programs.
<P>Tauscher, when asked why she did not fight the billions of dollars in 
other budget items, such as rehabilitation of the warhead manufacturing 
capability and the development of the next generation of missiles and bombers, 
said some nuclear weaponry had to remain in the nation's defensive arsenal.
<P>"As far as I'm concerned, it's an insurance policy," she said.
<P>But even inside the administration, questions have been raised about the 
rationale for the new nuclear posture. The Pentagon, notably, is not pushing 
for the new warheads. A classified study conducted this summer by the Defense 
Science Board, which was leaked last month, stated, "Current (Department of 
Defense) structure provides neither clear requirements nor persuasive 
rationale for changing the nuclear stockpile."
<P>John Harvey, director of the policy planning staff at the National 
Nuclear Security Administration, a division of the Energy Department, remarked 
in an interview earlier this year, "We need to tell the military what's 
possible, even if they haven't asked the question yet. Sometimes the services 
don't know the right questions to ask."
<P>Weldon said that the best he could do was wait and wage a bigger battle 
next year. He said he was trying to put together a group to study the entire 
arsenal and examine how it might be transformed to deal with the new threats.
<P>"The debate was on the smaller things this year," he said. "I think next 
year you'll see that debate widen. Next year will be different, I assure you."
<P>The administration does not seem concerned. Asked if the lawmakers' small 
budget cuts or expressions of concern altered the administration's direction, 
Brooks of the NNSA replied, "No, it doesn't."</p>
