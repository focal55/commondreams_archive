</table></font>The attacks, which occurred at 9:30 a.m., surprised  motorists who had ventured out during a lull in the bombing.  This correspondent saw at least five burned-out and twisted  cars parked in the middle of the road. Witnesses said the  drivers burned to death inside.<p>



		Residents said U.S. planes raided the Mansour area, firing  at least three missiles. They hit the hospital, the nearby  Baghdad trade center complex and buildings housing the  Pharmacist and Teachers' Unions.<p>



		The blast caused extensive damage in the hospital.<p>



		"There were air raids. Some 25 people who work and live in  the area were wounded. Three of our Red Crescent staff were  also wounded. We brought all the wounded in our ambulances to  two hospitals," Red Crescent official Abdel-Hameed Salim told  Reuters at Baghdad's al-Iskan hospital.<p>



		He said among the Red Crescent casualties was doctor  Mohammad Fadel, who was getting ready for a normally hectic day  in war times. Also injured was a patient who had come to see a  doctor. He was hit, requiring his leg to be amputated.<p>



		"We had a lot of medical supplies for rescue operations and  we don't know if they were destroyed or not," Salim added.<p>



		U.S. military spokesman Brigadier General Vincent Brooks  told reporters in Qatar: "I am not aware of the Red Crescent  report, so I cannot address it."<p>



		HIGHWAY POCKMARKED WITH CRATERS<p>



		Fires and smoke smoldered hours later from Baghdad's  luxurious trade center, which was devastated in the attack. It  lies next to a government security building, which was  apparently missed in the bombings.<p>



		The highway leading to the hospital and the trade fair was  pockmarked with craters caused by the attack.<p>



		Many of the wounded received first aid at the emergency  ward of Iskan hospital while some were immediately taken to  theater for surgery.<p>



		At two hospitals in Baghdad, Reuters journalists saw at  least 10 civilians who were wounded in air raid attacks.<p>



		After an unusual lull in bombing for most of the night,  strikes resumed shortly after 3 a.m. as the U.S.-led war to  oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein entered its 14th day.<p>



		U.S. planes pounded central Baghdad earlier in the day,  striking at least three times a compound where President Saddam  Hussein's son Qusay has his headquarters and sending thick  smoke into the sky. Qusay commands the Republican Guard.<p>



		"It was a very powerful explosion," correspondent Nadim  Ladki said. "It's the biggest I've seen today in daylight."<p>



		Sustained explosions pounded the southern outskirts of the  sprawling city until dawn, stopped for a time, and then resumed  at mid-morning.<p>



		Republican Guards are believed to have dug in south of the  city to defend Saddam from advancing U.S. troops. Anti-aircraft  fire was also heard on the outskirts.<p>



		The heavy bombing comes as U.S ground forces pressed on  toward Baghdad from the west and the east. The vanguard of  U.S.-led land troops have approached to within 19 miles of  Baghdad from the south.<p>



		U.S. forces have targeted key government buildings,  military and presidential sites in the city of over five  million people in the war that began on March 20.<p>



		Smoke poured out of a tall building to the west of the city  center, where many government buildings are located. A  communications center near a bridge across the river Tigris  also appeared to have been hit. Flames rose from the area.<p>



		Smoke also rose to the east of the center in an area where  air force and other military buildings are situated. Tracer  fire lit the sky and warplanes could be heard flying overhead  as anti-aircraft fire stuttered.
