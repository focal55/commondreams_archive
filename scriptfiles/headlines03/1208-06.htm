<p>BAGHDAD  - Iraq is verging on a catastrophic shortage of housing for its people, a senior housing ministry official said.
<p>
&quot;The need for housing has developed from a shortage, to a problem, to a crisis, and probably now it is a catastrophe,&quot; Saad Al-Zubaidi, a counselor to the interim minister of construction and housing, told AFP in an interview.
<p>
 Neglect of the housing sector under Saddam Hussein has been compounded recently by damage during the US-led war that toppled the former regime in April, and subsequent rent hikes by landlords, Zubaidi said.

  </table></font>&quot;A lot of landlords have asked to sharply increase the rent, and if they (the tenants) can't afford it they just kick them out,&quot; he said.
<p>
 The evictees then move into empty government buildings.
<p>
 &quot;They are in the thousands, and it's becoming a humanitarian issue of not being able to kick them out, and not being able to keep them in,&quot; said the London-educated architect and planner.
<p>
 AFP found several families on Sunday living in squalid conditions at a former Iraqi Air Force office building.
<p>
 &quot;Eight people live in this room,&quot; said Sadake Hamad, a toothless old woman who did not know her age.
<p>
 The room with a blue tile floor measured about three meters by four (nine feet by 13), or the size of a small bathroom. It's only comfort was a thin, worn mat along one wall.
<p>
 At night, the family makes room to sleep by moving their cooking utensils outside.
<p>
 The family said they became squatters just after the war when their landlord increased the rent on their Baghdad home.
<p>
 Zubaidi said close to half of Iraq's population of about 26 million are considered to be living below the poverty line and cannot afford decent housing.
<p>
 &quot;It is the responsibility of the state to find accommodation for them if they are citizens of this country,&quot; he said.
<p>
 Zubaidi's ministry has begun site preparation for three major housing complexes and has plans to build one million houses by 2010.
