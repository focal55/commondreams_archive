<p>WASHINGTON -- As war apparently draws nearer, anti-war members of Congress led by 

Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland outlined their last-ditch bid on Wednesday to 

reopen debate on whether the United States should attack Iraq.

<P>Lee's vehicle, the latest in a host of anti-war resolutions that the 

leadership of both houses has refused to take up, is the introduction of a 

nonbinding resolution that would put the House on record as opposing so-called 

wars of pre-emption.

<P>Lee and other anti-war House members admit there isn't much they can do to 

stop a war against Iraq, but they plan to hold more press conferences and try 

parliamentary maneuvers to force debate on the House and Senate floors.

<P>President Bush's supporters say Congress spoke on the issue in October when 

the House voted 296-133 and the Senate 77-23 to authorize the president to use 

military force against Iraq. They argue that Saddam Hussein is still refusing 

to obey United Nations Resolution 1441 calling for Iraq to disarm.

<P>Calling the president's justification for a pre-emptive attack against 

Hussein's regime "a statement of extreme arrogance and illegality," Lee said 

at a Capitol press conference that the Bush doctrine "undermines any moral 

authority of the United States in seeking peaceful resolution of any conflicts.

"

<P>One of her co-sponsors, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, was active on two 

fronts Wednesday. A lawsuit he and 14 other House members filed in U.S. 

District Court in Boston claiming Bush doesn't have the right to go to war 

without an express declaration from Congress was reinstated by an appeals 

court after a judge had thrown it out.

<P>Last week, Kucinich filed a House "resolution of inquiry," asking that Bush 

be required to turn over to the House all 12,000 classified pages of Iraq's 

report on its weapons of mass destruction that Hussein's regime gave the 

United Nations in December. Last Friday, the administration quietly handed the 

report to the House Select Intelligence Committee, and most House members can 

see it as long as they keep its contents secret.

<P>It's unclear whether Kucinich can view it, however. He, Rep. Pete Stark, D-

Fremont, and Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., have refused to sign the pledge of 

confidentiality required of all members if they want to see classified 

material.

<P>"I'm checking if I can get access," Kucinich said. "I think the American 

people will want to see it."

<P>On Wednesday, the House International Relations Committee sent Kucinich's 

resolution to the full House, even though it is a moot point. Leaders made it 

clear that any floor debate must be limited to the resolution's specifics and 

cannot include a wider debate on Iraq policy.

<P>Lee's proposal, which she introduced with more than a dozen House Democrats 

as co-sponsors, joins other bills recently introduced to try to forestall the 

move toward war. These include a proposal to repeal October's vote. Among the 

co-sponsors are Lee, Stark, Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, and Rep. Sam Farr, 

D-Carmel.

<P>Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., have a similar 

bill in the Senate.

<P>One member who voted for the resolution in October, Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-

Walnut Creek, has introduced a bill calling on Bush to make a full report to 

Congress before he launches an attack. And California's two senators, Barbara 

Boxer -- who voted against October's resolution -- and Dianne Feinstein -- who 

supported it -- put forward a resolution calling for U.N. inspectors to get 

more time to complete their work.

<P>Bush has left little doubt that he intends to act against Hussein and feels 

fully justified in doing so. "We are determined to confront threats wherever 

they arise," he said at his press conference last Thursday. "I will not leave 

the American people at the mercy of the Iraqi dictator and his weapons."
