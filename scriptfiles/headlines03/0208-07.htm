<p>WASHINGTON  - Christian church leaders and lay  people are taking an usually prominent role in the U.S.  anti-war movement, arguing that an attack against Iraq would  not fit the theological definition of a "just war."

<p>



		Leading Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian and Lutheran  clergy have for months been issuing statements and writing  petitions against the war and urging their followers to join  anti-war demonstrations. A leading Methodist bishop even  recently appeared on a television commercial against the war.<p>



		"The churches are very intensely involved in all aspects of  the peace movement. They are playing a very visible and active  role and they are equally involved behind the scenes in  fundraising, grassroots organizing and just rolling up their  sleeves and working," said Tom Andrews, a former Democratic  member of Congress who now serves as national director for Win  Without War, an umbrella anti-war group.<p>



		Barbara Epstein, a history professor at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, said church leaders had opposed many  past U.S. wars but the extent of their involvement this time  was remarkable.<p>



		"We see an extensive and growing role of the churches which  is very remarkable and is greater than we have seen before,"  said Epstein, who has studied previous anti-war movements.<p>



		That is not to suggest that a majority of U.S. Christians  oppose President Bush on Iraq. Many Protestants and Catholics  do not agree with their leaders and polls suggest the president  enjoys overwhelming support from southern conservatives, many  of whom are evangelical Christians.<p>



		Richard Land, speaking for the 16 million-member Southern  Baptist Convention, the largest denomination in the United  States, recently wrote to Bush assuring him that the Iraqi  threat satisfied the conditions of a "just war."<p>



		The same split emerged in the 1991 Gulf War, when some  Protestant and Catholic leaders raised moral concerns about the  U.S. military campaign to expel Iraq from Kuwait. But protests  then were on a much smaller scale.<p>



		At the heart of the debate is the Christian doctrine of a  just war, first formulated by St. Augustine in the 5th century  and built upon by later generations.<p>



		"In religious terms, the issue comes down to the just war  tradition, which holds that religion can sanction the  constrained use of violence but only if certain conditions are  fulfilled," said Frank Kirkpatrick, a professor of religion at  Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.<p>



		The current formulation lays out seven principles under  which war is permissible: to resist aggression or to defend its  victims; it should be waged to secure just goals; it should be  a last resort; it should be waged by a legitimate legal  authority; it should be limited in scope; its human cost should  be proportionate to the good it is intended to achieve, and it  should exclude civilians and noncombatants.<p>



		"The key provision is the one referring to war only as a  last resort. That's where most of the churches feel that Bush  has not yet made his case," said Kirkpatrick.<p>



		Bush acknowledged the debate in his State of the Union  address last week when he said, "If war is forced upon us, we  will fight in a just cause and by just means."<p>



		VEHEMENT LANGUAGE<p>



		Some of the language of church leaders against the war has  been surprisingly vehement. United Methodist Board of Church  and Society director Jim Winkler caused a stir in religious  circles in September 2002 when he stated it was "inconceivable  that Jesus Christ would support this proposed attack."<p>



		A few weeks later, the Methodists wrote to Bush, who is a  member of their church, saying, "A preemptive war by the United  States against a nation like Iraq goes against the very grain  of our understanding of the gospel, our church's teachings, and  our conscience."<p>



		More recently, Frank Griswold, presiding bishop of the  Episcopal Church, got into a public dispute with former  President George Bush, father of the present incumbent.<p>



		In an interview with a religious news service, Griswold  said, "We are loathed and I think the world has every right to  loath us ... I'd like to be able to go somewhere in the world  and not have to apologize for being from the United States."<p>



		The elder Bush, who is an Episcopalian, said, "I found  these particular quotes to be offensive. And knowing the  president as I do, I found them uncalled for."<p>



		Spurred by statements from Pope John Paul II, who last  month implored Washington to look for peaceful ways to settle  its differences with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Catholic  leaders have also spoken out strongly against the war.<p>



		New York Cardinal Edward Egan recently called for U.N.  weapons inspectors to be able to continue their work in Iraq.  During a teleconference for priests, Egan said that justifying  war requires "clear and certain knowledge of a clear and  certain danger."<p>



		George Weigel, a prominent Catholic commentator and  biographer of Pope John Paul II, said just war theory needed to  be updated to meet new conditions, specifically the emergence  of international terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass  destruction. He believes war against Iraq is justified.<p>



		"Some of these clerical opponents of war have given  themselves over to a functional pacifism, a conviction that  there are virtually no circumstances in which the proportionate  and discriminate use of armed force can serve the goals of  peace, order, justice and freedom," he said.

		<p>



		"The evangelical churches seem to have a clearer  understanding of what wickedness can do in the world, a  realization of the reality of evil," he said.
