</table></font>A Democratic member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said today that a White House official insisted that claims about Iraqi attempts to purchase uranium be included in President Bush's State of the Union address, despite doubts from the Central Intelligence Agency about its credibility.
<p>As the Senate continued to trade charges over the handling of classified information related to the war in Iraq, Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, told fellow senators today that people in the White House were "bound and determined" to include the allegation in the address, despite being discouraged by George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence.
<p>"The president has within his ranks on staff some person who was willing to spin and hype and exaggerate and cut corners on the most important speech the president delivers in any given year," Mr. Durbin said as he offered a proposal to hold up $50 million in intelligence spending until the president delivers a report on the handling of the Iraqi intelligence.
<p>Earlier today, Mr. Durbin said on ABC's "Good Morning America" that Mr. Tenet, in an closed appearance before the intelligence panel on Wednesday, named the official responsible for pushing for the line about uranium in the speech. But Mr. Durbin said he could not disclose that person's identity. "It should come from the president," he said.
<p>The allegation prompted immediate rebuttal from the White House, where it was termed "nonsense," and by Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who on the Senate floor accused Democrats of "nitpicking" and suggested some lawmakers were breaking secrecy rules surrounding the Intelligence Committee.
<p>"Its time to settle down and get back to the business or providing money for the men and women in uniform around the world and to assure that the people who conduct our intelligence activities have the money to do what they've got to do," Mr. Stevens said.
<p>The exchange followed a day of barbed attempts by Democrats to use a measure financing the Pentagon as a vehicle to attack the Bush administration's handling of the war with Iraq and its aftermath.</p>
