<p>LOS ANGELES - 

Lights, camera, action! ... a

helmet and flak jacket would be very useful, too.



<p>

If a war breaks out in Iraq, the U.S. Navy  and Marine Corps

plan to film soldiers on the front lines of battle and bring

their stories to movie audiences in video spots similar to the

old Movietone film reels made during World War II, people

involved with the effort said on Wednesday.

 <p>

 The idea, explained Marine Lt. Colonel James Kuhn, is to

show people the real images of war and put a human face on the

men and women fighting it.

 <p>

 "It's intended to fulfill the Navy and Marine Corps

obligation to maintain a strong tie to the public, to let them

know what we're doing," Kuhn said. "It's an opportunity for

people to hear how the soldiers feel about what they do."

 <p>

 The reels, too, will give audiences the chance to see what

actually happens in battle as it happens -- bullets flying,

bombs blasting and people being put in harm's way.

 <p>

 The effort stems from a roughly five-minute short film the

Navy and Marines made after the Sept. 11 attacks and the

U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan  called "Enduring Freedom --

The Opening Chapter."

 <p>

 PAST PRECEDENT

 <p>

 That film played in about 200 Regal Entertainment Group

theaters equipped with digital projection equipment last year,

and through word-of-mouth publicity, it has become a hit at

public events, business conferences and private seminars, Kuhn

said.

 <p>

 Lance O'Connor, a partner in Santa Monica, California-based

American Rogue Films, which trained and equipped soldiers with

new high-definition digital cameras to shoot the video, said

the reels will be made in the same vein as documentaries.

 <p>

 "It's not about propaganda, it's about documentary work. If

it were propaganda, it wouldn't work," he said.

 <p>

 Kuhn agreed. "It's not being done to create a statement on

policy one way or the other," he said.

 <p>

 O'Connor's company put together "Enduring Freedom," and for

years has made promotional spots for the U.S. military.

 <p>

 He said "Enduring Freedom" includes live footage of battles

in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and that similarly, the camera crews

for this new effort will be in the middle of the action.

 <p>

 "Our guys are going straight to the front ... secret

operations, Navy SEALs, whatever is going over on the first

tier (of operations), we're going to film it," he said.

 <p>

 While "hard combat" will be featured, the men and women

doing the fighting also will tell personal stories of how they

feel about war and about serving their country, Kuhn said.

 <p>

 "It's a story of who these people are and why they do what

they do," he said.

 <p>

 A spokeswoman for Regal CineMedia, the Regal division that

outfits theaters with new digital projection systems, said her

company does not yet have plans to show the films, but is

talking with the Navy and Marines about doing so.

 <p>

 "I'm sure those discussions will continue to go forward,

she said.

<p>

Kuhn said the films will be available to the general

public, anyway, regardless of whether movie theaters decide to

screen them ahead of films.

<p>

The military has a long history of battle photography

dating back to the Civil War, and in 1944, a Marine staff

sergeant won an Oscar for a World War II short, "With the

Marines at Tarawa."
