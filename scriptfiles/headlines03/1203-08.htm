<p>Conservative Republican frustration over 
              the failure of the Bush administration and the House Republican 
              leadership to restrain federal spending has boiled over in recent 
              days, producing a rare confrontation between GOP lawmakers and party 
              leaders.<p>
              The internal conflict, fueled largely by recent passage of the $78 
              billion Iraq reconstruction effort and the $400 billion prescription-drug 
              benefit for senior citizens that squeaked through the House on Nov. 
              22, came to a head last week when President Bush abruptly terminated 
              a phone conversation with a Florida Republican who refused his plea 
              to vote for the landmark bill.<p>
              Well-placed sources said Bush hung up on freshman Rep. Tom Feeney 
              after Feeney said he couldn&#8217;t support the Medicare bill. The 
              House passed it by only two votes after Hastert kept the roll-call 
              vote open for an unprecedented stretch of nearly three hours in 
              the middle of the night.</p><p> Feeney, a former Speaker of the 
              Florida House of Representatives whom many see as a rising star 
              in the party, reportedly told Bush: &#8220;I came here to cut entitlements, 
              not grow them.&#8221;<p>
              Sources said Bush shot back, &#8220;Me too, pal,&#8221; and hung 
              up the phone.<p>
              At the same time, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) castigated 
              former House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) after he wrote 
              an op-ed article in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> opposing the 
              bill. Armey wrote that he opposed the bill even though he had voted 
              for two similar bills as a member of Congress. <p>
              House leadership aides said Hastert and Majority Leader Tom DeLay 
              (R-Texas) felt blindsided by Armey&#8217;s op-ed, which came at 
              a time when they were trying desperately to round up the necessary 
              votes. <p>
              &#8220;The Speaker is very disappointed about the article, especially 
              because Mr. Armey voted for prescription-drugs bills that had even 
              less reform than the conference report did when he was a member,&#8221; 
              Hastert spokesman John Feehery told The Hill on Monday.<p>
              But Armey, who said he called Hastert to sort out their differences, 
              put a different spin on the exchange.<p>
              &#8220;[Hastert] understood where I was coming from and that a lot 
              of people felt the way I did,&#8221; Armey told The Hill. &#8220;I 
              made the night longer than it ought to have been. One of things 
              we do in our party is appreciate freedom of expression.&#8221;<p>
              He added: &#8220;Everybody in the heat of the deal thinks things 
              like that are bigger than life, but things cool down.&#8221; <p>
              Armey, now a lobbyist at the Piper Rudnick law firm, said he was 
              not worried that his access to the GOP leadership would be limited 
              or that Hastert and others would penalize the clients whom he advises.<p>
              House aides contrasted Armey with former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), 
              who was praised by Republicans for his support of the Medicare bill 
              the week of the vote.<p>
              Gingrich had fallen out of favor with the White House and many Republicans 
              earlier this year when he attacked Secretary of State Colin Powell&#8217;s 
              management of the State Department. <p>
              A GOP aide said that, had lawmakers voted after Gingrich&#8217;s 
              rousing speech to the GOP conference, the vote would not have lasted 
              three hours. Gingrich also wrote a positive editorial in <em>The 
              Wall Street Journal</em>.<p>
              Republican aides said conservatives who voted against the bill, 
              including Reps. Mike Pence (Ind.), John Culberson (Texas), Jeff 
              Flake (Ariz.), Roscoe Bartlett (Md.) and Jim Ryun (Kan.), would 
              suffer for their votes against the Medicare bill.<p>
              Leadership aides said those members &#8220;can expect to remain 
              on the back bench&#8221; in the months ahead. <p>
              &#8220;Health savings accounts are the most dramatic reform of health 
              care in 30 years,&#8221; Feehery said. &#8220;Conservatives said 
              they all loved it, but once in the bill they forgot about it.&#8221;<p>
              The fallout over the conservative resistance included some lawmakers 
              who are considered rising stars in the party, as well as a major 
              conservative think tank that aided House Democrats in nearly derailing 
              Bush&#8217;s top domestic initiative. <p>
              Although the House GOP assembled a 400-member coalition in support 
              of the bill, the Heritage Foundation opposed the bill and even held 
              a briefing for members in the Dirksen Building the day before the 
              vote.<p>
              Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), who voted against the bill when the 
              Senate passed it by a 54-44 vote, allowed Heritage to use the room 
              the day before the vote. That decision was made at a very low level 
              in the office, according to Rachel Oliphant, Nickles&#8217; press 
              secretary. <p>
              &#8220;So far, we&#8217;ve not seen any penalties coming our way,&#8221; 
              said Stuart Butler, vice president for economic and domestic policy 
              at Heritage. &#8220;[We have] quite a long history of taking issue 
              with the Republican leadership and White House.&#8221;<p>
              Butler said that Heritage had vigorously attacked Presidents Reagan 
              and George H. W. Bush for raising taxes in 1982 and 1990, respectively. </p>
