<p>LONDON - Around 100,000 protesters marched  through London and tore down a mock statue of visiting  President Bush Thursday, many of them convinced his policies  were to blame for anti-British bombs in Turkey.<p>

  </table></font>Demonstrators of all ages beat drums and blew whistles  along a 3-mile route that took them past parliament and the end  of Downing Street, where crowds paused to jeer toward Prime  Minister Tony Blair's office.<p> 
			
							When they reached Trafalgar Square, protesters felled a  20-foot papier mache statue of Bush in a parody of the toppling  of a statue of Saddam Hussein when U.S. troops swept into  Baghdad. In its top pocket was a puppet with a grinning Blair  face.<p> 
			
							"Bush and Blair said they were fighting a war against  terror to make the world a safer place for people," said Paul  Burrows, 38, a university lecturer. "They haven't done that.  Going out bombing people just gives them more reason to hate  the West."<p> 
			
							Hours earlier, suspected Islamist suicide car bombers had  attacked the British consulate and the offices of Britain's  HSBC bank in Istanbul, killing at least 27 and wounding  hundreds.<p> 
			
							At a joint news conference, Bush and British Prime Minister  Tony Blair declared their determination to wipe out terrorism  wherever it occurred.<p> 
			
							That stance won little backing among demonstrators angry at  the U.S.-led war in Iraq and suspicious of American motives.<p> 
			
							"The terrorist attacks are exactly the sort of thing we  predicted would happen if they went into Iraq. They've proved  us right," said Martin Smith, 64, a documentary film maker from  Bristol, England.<p> 
			
							Alex Pummell, 28, said invading Iraq had greatly increased  the risk of attack "and not just for us but for any country  supporting British countries and organizations."<p>

  </table></font>Organizers estimated as many as 300,000 people had taken  part in the demonstration. A police crowd control officer on  the ground put the turn-out at above 120,000, while Scotland  Yard's press office said there were 70,000 protesters.<p> 
			
							A group of London schoolchildren skipped class to join the  demonstration. "We don't want Bush here," said Dyana, 14.<p> 
			
							She and her friends marched shoulder to shoulder with  pensioners, office workers and students banging drums and  blowing whistles. Some protesters wore Bush masks, others were  dressed as Ronald McDonald.<p> 
			
							Philip Miller, 79, said he had flown over from the United  States especially for the march: "I was in World War II and  I've seen some of the horrors of war, the distress of the  civilian population, the hunger and homes destroyed."<p> 
			
							Touring Buckingham Palace's collection of jeweled Faberge  eggs, first lady Laura Bush told reporters she had barely  noticed the opposition to her husband's state visit to Britain.<p> 
			
							"We've seen plenty of American flags. We've seen plenty of  people waving to us -- many, many more people in fact than  protesters," she said.<p> 
			
							All police leave was canceled for the duration of Bush's  visit and over 5,000 officers were on the streets. Police said  they had made 46 arrests since Bush's arrival Tuesday evening,  all for minor offenses such as drunkenness.<p>
