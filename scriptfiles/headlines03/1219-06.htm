<p>QUITO  - In a steamy jungle of winding laurel
trees and sprawling palms, a battle is raging between
Ecuadorean Indians trying to protect land rights and oil
companies who want to drill in the Amazon.
<p>
 In the northern Amazon, Indians are suing a U.S. oil
company over environmental damage they say ruined their land
and made people sick. Further south, indigenous demonstrators
have led violent protests to keep firms off their property.
<p>
 Ecuador is one of Latin America's least stable nations and
has a powerful Indian movement. But it is also one of the
region's most promising nations for oil development with a
government eager to tap five billion barrels in reserves.

 <!--/endimage/-->Analysts say it could be tough for Ecuador to attract
investment unless tensions are eased with indigenous
communities, who make up nearly half the people in the Amazon
and are backed by a powerful national left-wing Indian
movement.
 <p>
 Dressed in a pink robe and sashes of nutshells, Secoya
Indian Elias Piayahuaje is one of 30,000 plaintiffs who accuse
U.S. oil giant ChevronTexaco of destroying the jungle
environment in a decade-old lawsuit that has made many of
Ecuador's Indians wary of promises of "black gold."
 <p>
 "There's no way for the Secoya people to get their life
back," said Piyahuaje, 47, leader of the 400-strong tribe. He
said oily pits left by a Texaco subsidiary continue to leak a
black sludge into rivers when it rains in northern Sucumbios
and Orellana provinces, the heart of the country's oil industry
near the Colombian border.
<p>
 The lawsuit so far hasn't put off investment, analysts say,
citing a new &#36;1.4 billion pipeline built this year by private
oil firms. But companies are keeping an eye on an eventual
ruling that could affect the industry, they said.
<p>
 Texaco, which merged with Chevron in 2001, says it followed
accepted procedures during its two decades in the Amazon and
paid for a &#36;40 million clean-up that was approved by the
Ecuadorean government after its contract to produce crude with
state oil company Petroecuador ended in 1992.
<p>
 Texaco no longer operates oil blocks in Ecuador.
<p>
 SOUTHERN AMAZON
<p>
 Ecuador's government is hoping for a second oil boom now
that the new pipeline has been built -- which could double the
nation's crude output -- to reduce the poverty blighting the
lives of 60 percent of its people.
<p>
 But more than 125 miles further south, Argentine oil
company CGC and U.S. Burlington Resources Inc. have had
government contracts to explore for crude for more than three
years and neither has been able to drill a single well.
<p>
 Achuar Indians have protested against oil development by
kidnapping workers and holding demonstrations, saying they must
protect the pristine forest where they've lived for decades.
They are betting on an ecotourism project instead of oil.
<p>
 "We've seen proof, we don't want what has happened in
Sucumbios and Orellana to happen to us," said Achuar leader
Milton Callera. "Our government can't resolve this problem."
<p>
 Another group, the Quichua-speaking Sarayacu, say they
oppose any oil development projects.
<p>
 Burlington has admitted it can't move forward on its
exploration schedule due to area protests. CGC, which won its
contract in 1996, halted operations this year after workers
were kidnapped by Indian protesters.
<p>
 "We're sandwiched between the state and Sarayacu and we're
the only ones who are losing in this whole story," said CGC's
representative in Ecuador, Ricardo Nicolas.
<p>
 The Energy Ministry has signed pacts to aid several
indigenous communities that do support oil activity.
<p>
"When the companies begin activity again, we will take
precautions and order civil authorities and police to lend
their support," Energy Minister Carlos Arboleda told reporters,
while accusing foreign environmental groups of rousing the
Indians.
<p>
INVESTORS WARY
<p>
The government aims to attract &#36;6.4 billion to double oil
output to more than 750,000 bpd over the next eight years. Oil
is already Ecuador's biggest export and accounts for 20 percent
of its economy, according to the Central Bank.
<p>
But oil sector analysts say the country will have a tough
time competing for investment with countries like post-war
Iraq (<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Iraq%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw">news</a> - <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?cs=nw&p=Iraq">web sites</a>), despite its ample crude reserves.
<p>
"How can they go to a company asking for bids if they
haven't resolved the problem of the moratorium on oil
development sought by indigenous communities?" said Rene Ortiz,
president of Ecuador's private oil industry association.
<p>
One reason Ecuador has been unable to convince jungle
dwellers of the benefits of oil is that the cash it generates
is channelled to the central government instead of the Amazon
region, where 78 percent of people are poor.
<p>
Standing outside his rundown cosmetics shop, Santiago
Alomoto, 25, points to the broken stone tiles lining the street
in the jungle town of Lago Agrio as evidence that those who
live in the crude-rich Amazon are often the last to see its
benefits.
<p>
"All the oil and gold that's in the earth should be
exploited," said Alomoto, who is not Indian but a long-time
jungle dweller. "But the wealth should stay right here."
