<p>Playing bluesy funeral dirges, a Dixieland band led about 200 antiwar demonstrators from Morningside Heights to Bryant Park yesterday on a frigid, misty, gray Manhattan morning. Marchers carried mock coffins. A woman wore a black shroud.</p>

<P> While the protest was presented as a funeral procession for the "dead and not yet dead" in Iraq, its inspiration drew heavily on the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..</p>

<P> It was a particularly strong example of how opponents of the Iraq war have been invoking King's legacy.</p>

</table></font>"Thousands and millions of people marching against the war reveals that the seeds of Martin Luther King and his vision of nonviolence have nourished hearts around the world," the Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes Jr., senior minister of Riverside Church, said in an interview before the march.</p>

<P> It began across the street from Riverside Church in front of Grant's Tomb, with its "Let us have peace" inscription, and ended with speeches in Bryant Park.</p>

<P> The march was part of a weekend of events that organizers have linked to King, who was assassinated 35 years ago yesterday. There was special resonance because one year before the day he was killed, on April 4, 1967, King delivered a speech at Riverside Church that outlined, for the first time, his opposition to the Vietnam War. He risked the anger of President Lyndon Johnson, and of fellow civil rights leaders who thought that speaking out against the war undermined the effort for racial equality. While the speech is not among his most remembered, scholars say it gave an important lift to the antiwar movement.</p>

<P> "There was definitely a sense among many people that to have King on the other side of the war debate was a major step," said Clayborne Carson, a history professor at Stanford University and director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project.</p>

<P> These days, religious leaders and peace proponents hail the speech for connecting opposition to war to the fight for social justice. They also invoke King's doctrine of nonviolence in the struggle for racial equality.</p>

<P> "The linkages he was making are still extremely timely and important," said the Rev. James Fitzgerald, an associate minister at Riverside and the protest organizer. "We are children of King."</p>

<P> The anniversary of his death was an occasion for other antiwar events in King's name. Readings of the 1967 speech took place at St. Nicholas Park in Manhattanville, and a march is planned in Harlem today. </p>

<P> Beyond that, King's face has popped up on T-shirts and posters in many recent protests. The War Resisters League has a portrait of him in its office, and members hand out tags with his face and a quotation from one of his speeches.</p>

<P> In his speech at Riverside in 1967, Dr. King called the war "an enemy of the poor" that sapped the nation's ability to fight poverty, "like some demonic, destructive suction tube." A country that spends more on defense than on social programs "is approaching spiritual death," he said.</p>

<P> He spoke of the "cruel irony" of young black men and young white men dying together in Vietnam but unable to sit together in some schools. He said he could not condemn violence in the civil rights struggle while at the same time failing to raise his voice against "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government."</p>

<P> "If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read `Vietnam,' " he said, calling for a "revolution of values."</p>

<P> He urged young men to declare themselves conscientious objectors, and made suggestions on how to end the war: stopping the bombing of North Vietnam, declaring a unilateral cease-fire, curtailing the military buildup in the region and setting a deadline for troop withdrawal.</p>

<P> In closing, King issued a call for human fellowship and an end to hate.</p>

<P> "We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation," he said. "If we make the right choice, we will be able to speed up the day, all over America and all over the world, when justice will roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."</p>
