<p>CHICAGO  - For the bleary-eyed able to stomach a  tidbit of health news after ringing in the New Year, more  Americans are getting fat and drunk each year, with sometimes  deadly results, researchers said on Tuesday.

<p>



		More than one in five American adults could be classified  as obese in 2001, up almost 6 percent from the year before. And  more than one in four Americans engage in bouts of binge  drinking -- defined as five or more drinks at one sitting with  the goal of getting drunk -- up 35 percent from 1995.<p>



		"I guess you could say we're fat and drunk," said Timothy  Naimi, a researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention in Atlanta, summarizing a pair of studies based on a  huge telephone survey of more than 200,000 adults.<p>



		"We're a society that is somewhat taken with excesses,"  Naimi said.<p>



		The studies' publication in the Journal of the American  Medical Association was timed by the journal to coincide with  the revelry associated with New Year's eve.<p>



		DEADLY NEW YEAR'S<p>



		U.S. driving fatalities more than double on New Year's day  as celebrants take to the roads.<p>



		According to the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration, an average of 393 people died in traffic  accidents after midnight on New Year's day over the past three  years, more than half of them alcohol-related. That compares to  the daily average of about 115 traffic deaths -- roughly 42,000  a year -- 40 percent of them blamed on alcohol.<p>



		Bingeing -- whether on alcohol or food -- is a potentially  fatal health problem, CDC researchers said.<p>



		Abuse of alcohol kills roughly 100,000 Americans a year,  the third-leading cause of preventable deaths after smoking and  physical inactivity. Binge drinking accounted for roughly half  those 100,000 deaths, Naimi said.<p>



		Drinking and driving was a particularly deadly combination  among binge drinkers, who were 14 times more likely to get  behind the wheel than adults who drank but not to excess. Binge  drinking is also behind many sexual assaults, domestic violence  incidents, and other crimes, the report said.<p>



		Drinking to get drunk is more prevalent among men than  women, with men accounting for 81 percent of the 1.5 billion  U.S. binge-drinking episodes in 2001, it said.<p>



		Three-quarters of binge drinkers were people who otherwise  considered themselves moderate drinkers, the study found, and  the practice is not confined to the college-age set, with 70  percent of episodes undertaken by people over age 25.<p>



		Roughly half of adult Americans do not drink at all.<p>



		Efforts to stem binge drinking might find a parallel in  anti-smoking campaigns that seem to be working, Naimi said.<p>



		But while tax increases on cigarettes have helped choke off  demand especially among the young, alcohol taxes have not kept  pace with inflation over the past two decades, he said.<p>



		Meanwhile, more than a dozen U.S. states lag in lowering  the legal blood-alcohol limit for impaired drivers, legislation  that has been found to save lives, and many doctors ignore  public health pleas to question patients about their drinking  habits.<p>



		DRUNK AND PROUD<p>



		Too often, Naimi said, heavy drinking episodes are accepted  as a joke or heralded as a badge of courage, and ebullient  liquor advertising too often targets the young. The growing fad  of "supersizing" bar drinks has become as common as fast-food  franchises' expanded portions of fatty French fries.<p>



		"Of course, wagging my finger doesn't carry too much  water," Naimi said, adding that the goal was moderation, not  necessarily abstinence. "We don't live in prohibition."<p>



		Obesity is another killer, and its prevalence among U.S.  adults nearly doubled in the past decade to 21 percent of  adults, the CDC researchers said.<p>



		Obesity has been declared a global problem by the World  Health Organization, and 45 percent of adults in some oil-rich  Persian Gulf nations are obese, study author Ali Mokdad said.<p>



		Europeans are generally slimmer than Americans, but are  catching up fast.<p>



		"We drive longer distances, everything is done by machines,  we spend all our time on computers," Mokdad said by way of  explaining the fattening of some Americans. Eating healthy  foods requires effort, he said, while eating a bad diet is  relatively inexpensive.<p>



		Excess fat, like alcohol abuse, causes a host of related  health problems, the researchers said.<p>



		For instance, the rising rates of obesity corresponds with  an increase in the prevalence of diabetes, which afflicts more  than one out of 12 adults, an increase of 8 percent in 2001  from the year before.<p>



		"Each year, an estimated 300,000 U.S. adults die of causes  related to obesity, and diabetes is the sixth leading cause of  death," Mokdad wrote.
