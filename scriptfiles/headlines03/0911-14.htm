<p>JERUSALEM   - Israel decided in principle to exile  Yasser Arafat after a wave of suicide bombings, touching off  protests by tens of thousands of Palestinians and drawing  pledges by some to defend him at his headquarters.<P>

  </table></font>Israel's security cabinet vowed to "remove" Arafat after a  meeting on Thursday. It made no direct reference to expelling  Arafat but sources close to the government said it had asked  the army to draw up plans to exile him, although not  immediately.<P>
"You are brave people, my loved ones. Abu Ammar is staying  here," Arafat later told a huge crowd at his headquarters in  the West Bank city of Ramallah, using his nom de guerre as he  blew kisses and flashed the V-for-victory sign.<P>
"You are the ones who are capable of responding to this  Israeli threat," he said, flanked by security guards, as the  crowd vowed to support and defend him.<P>
Palestinian Prime Minister-designate Ahmed Qurie responded  to Israel's decision by suspending efforts to form a cabinet,  saying that expelling Arafat could "blow up" the Middle East.<P>
A wave of Palestinian suicide bombings and a series of  Israeli air strikes that have killed 12 Islamic militants since  a suicide bombing on August 19 have plunged the region into new  violence and all but killed off a U.S.-backed peace "road map."<P>
The cabinet, which groups top government ministers and  security officials under Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, met for  several hours to discuss how to respond to two suicide bombings  which killed 15 people in Israel on Tuesday.<P>
"The events of recent days prove again that Yasser Arafat  is the absolute obstacle to any process of conciliation between  the Israeli and Palestinian people," Sharon's office said.<P>
"Israel will act to remove this obstacle in a manner that  that will be determined separately."<P>
ULTIMATUM<P>
Israel and the United States have accused Arafat, 74, of  fomenting violence during the three-year-old Palestinian  uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. He denies the charge.<P>
The decision amounted to an ultimatum to the Palestinians  to crack down on Islamic militant groups, as mandated under the  road map, political analysts said. "It is more of a political  threat, an ultimatum," said Eli Karmon, an Israeli  counter-terrorism expert.<P>
It also seemed intended to further isolate Arafat and  signal to Qurie he must act independently and rein in militant  groups.<P>
Instead, it prompted the biggest outpouring of support for  Arafat in many months. His Fatah political movement urged  followers to occupy Arafat's headquarters night and day to  prevent an army assault, and some appeared to be bedding down.<P>
"This is an adventurous and grave decision (by Israel)  that... finishes off any attempt by me to form a new cabinet,"  Qurie said. "(If implemented), this grave and adventurous  decision would not only blow up the Palestinian territories but  also the entire region."<P>
The United States said that expelling Arafat would not be  helpful. The European Union expressed "great concern."<P>
Any attempt to expel Arafat, who controls the most  important Palestinian security forces, could end in bloodshed.  He keeps a pistol at his side and has said he would be ready to  die rather than give himself up.<P>
It is not clear how Israel would pluck Arafat from his  headquarters, even though they are half demolished from  previous army raids, or where he would be cast into exile.<P>
He has in the past taken refuge in Jordan, Lebanon and  Tunisia but such states would be unlikely to welcome him now.
