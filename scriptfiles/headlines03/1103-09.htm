<p>BERLIN  - The U.S. military said Monday it was  sticking to a policy forbidding television camera crews and  photographers from filming coffins of soldiers killed in Iraq  at a U.S. air base in southwestern Germany.

				<P>Officials at Ramstein, a major U.S. air base which serves  as a transfer point, had allowed media access in the past to  honor guard ceremonies and transfers of American-flag covered  coffins onto U.S.-bound military transport planes. But rules  banning coverage were strictly enforced just before the Iraq  war began.

				<P>While U.S. officials say the policy was created out of  respect for relatives, others criticize the lack of media  access, arguing its aim is to prevent the public from seeing  large numbers of coffins that could turn public opinion against  the war.

				<P>"You can argue both sides," said one U.S. official who  asked not to be identified. "Some say Americans need to see  this, this is factual and the public needs to see (the  coffins). Yet you also think of the mom of a killed soldier and  the trauma of seeing television pictures of her son being  repatriated."

				<P>Journalists seeking access to Ramstein to film coffins of  15 Americans killed Sunday in Iraq when their helicopter was  shot down were told that Department of Defense policy was still  "No." Only coverage of injured soldiers was permitted.

				<P>"The D.O.D. policy is that there is no media coverage of  deceased military personnel returning to or departing from  Ramstein Air Force base or Dover Air Force base," said Maj.  Bill Bigelow, U.S. European command spokesman in Stuttgart.

				<P>A Defense Department official denied there was any  censorship and said the purpose of the policy was to protect  the privacy of families "during their times of greatest loss  and grief." The rule has been in effect since 1991 and was  reaffirmed in March, he said.

				<P>However in recent years the rule was relaxed and television  journalists in Germany were able to cover honor guard  ceremonies, including the transfer of coffins of sailors killed  in an attack on the U.S.S. Cole and the war in Afghanistan.

				<P>"During 'Enduring Freedom' the D.O.D. did make some  exceptions in the policy," said Major Mike Young, public  affairs chief for the 86th airlift wing in Ramstein.

				<P>"Since 'Iraqi Freedom' started the D.O.D. said we are going  to enforce the policy. For the past year we haven't done any  (media coverage) on remains."

				<P>The corpses of most of the 250 American servicemen killed  in Iraq have passed through Ramstein since the war began. In  some cases after the seven-hour flight from Iraq they are  transferred to another plane for an eight-hour flight to Dover.

				<P>"We were a bit surprised by the sudden ban (on covering  coffins)," said Andy Eckardt, a producer based in Mainz for NBC  who covered about five such transfers there in recent years.  "But we follow the regulations. What can I do? It's the  military. They own the base."
