<p>NORTH PALM BEACH --Tossing aside their signs -- No Iraq War -- and then their shorts, T-shirts and bikinis, 23 protesters lay in the sand to form a peace symbol at the John D. MacArthur Beach State Park.</p>

<p> &#34;Being nude is being vulnerable, and that&#39;s the message of peace,&#34; T.A. Wyner said Friday. </p>

</table></font>Wyner, a veteran Fort Pierce naturist, helped organize the Living Nude Peace Sign. On Thursday, a U.S. District court ruled that the nude protest was legal at the public beach.</p>

<p>  Park rangers watched impassively from a couple of  hundred yards away as Wyner built the peace symbol with bare bodies in the rough sand. Park employees spent 90 minutes Friday morning putting up a U-shaped screen to shield other beach visitors from the protesters, but Wyner purposely positioned the peace symbol, which included 15 men and eight women, on the open beach.</p>

<p> &#34;This demonstration has now become not only anti-war,&#34; she said, &#34;but free speech rights, too. Today we celebrate the First Amendment.&#34;</p>

<p>  The Valentine&#39;s Day protest was a field trip for nudists attending the four-day Mid-Winter Naturist Festival at the Sunsport Gardens Nudist Resort in Loxahatchee. About 350 naturists from around North America are at the annual gathering, which ends Tuesday.</p>

<p>  &#34;This protest is important,&#34; said Morley Schloss, one of Sunsport&#39;s owners and a peace symbol participant. &#34;I think this protest is cumulative with all the others and will do some good because most people around the world are opposed to a war only to get our hands on the second largest oil supply.&#34;</p>

<p> The protesters created two versions of a peace sign. Surrounded by TV and newspaper photographers, they were face up for European papers and face down for U.S. papers.</p>

<p> Larry Fassalino, vacationing from Long Island, happened upon the protest by accident and decided to strip for the anti-war cause. </p>

<p> &#34;Hey, I never got naked before in public,&#34; said the 46-year-old contractor, &#34;but I just had to do it. I agree with them. And this is still the best country in the world because we get to do this.&#34;</p>

<p> Jim Skinner, vacationing from New Hampshire, went to the protest with his wife, Barbara, and daughter, Jessica. But the Vietnam veteran, who&#39;s a naturist vacationing at Sunsport Gardens, didn&#39;t become part of the peace symbol.</p>

<p> &#34;I could not do that to our troops,&#34; he said, &#34;but I came to support my wife and daughter&#39;s right to do it.&#34;</p>

<p> Jessica, 24, a Chino, Calif., art teacher, was the youngest protester. &#34;It&#39;s my generation that&#39;s going to war,&#34; she said. &#34;Maybe if people see this in their community, maybe they&#39;ll realize the war isn&#39;t a good idea.&#34;</p>

<p> The nude protesters were all proud to make a statement they hope will be seen on the Internet and in newspapers around the world. </p>

<p> &#34;I just wish I didn&#39;t have such a big gut,&#34; lamented Fassalino, the accidental nudist.</p>
