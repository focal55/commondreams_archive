<p>Even as U.S. troops inch toward the Persian Gulf for a possible war with 

Iraq, anti-war activists say it can be difficult to rally outrage or media 

interest back home. So a group of Marin County women has resorted to the 

ultimate attention grabber: getting nude.

</table></font>Since November, more than 200 women -- calling themselves Unreasonable 

Women Baring Witness -- have used their naked bodies to spell out anti-war 

slogans on three sites: a Marin beach, ball field and dung-laden pasture.

<P>While some may say the gesture trivializes and distracts from the gravity 

of the anti-war message, Unreasonable Women organizer Donna Sheehan said 

desperate times . . .

<P>"It got your attention, didn't it?" joked Sheehan of Marshall, who said she 

doesn't even go into the kitchen without a robe on.

<P>Longtime activists say the Unreasonables are only one of a growing number 

of peace vigils springing up across the Bay Area. In most cases, the vigilists 

are performing small gestures of public devotion to a cause they see as being 

overlooked.

<P>Whether it's Singing for Peace serenading BART riders or a man beaming a 

PowerPoint message on an Interstate 580 overpass, homegrown activists are 

taking their message to the streets. They are bypassing mainstream media 

outlets they say are ignoring their pleas for a peaceful resolution to the 

Iraqi crisis. They're tired of pundits accepting war as a foregone conclusion 

and giving little airtime to diplomatic solutions.

<P>Yet Sheehan said her group isn't full of activists, or "bored Marin 

housewives," as one naysayer referred to them. Their Jan. 4 protest -- in 

which they spelled "No War" on a Marin pasture -- in more waitresses (seven) 

than Ph.D.s (six), more social workers (four) than doctors (two) and only two 

self-described " '60s radicals." None was a nudist -- until recently.

<P>They are Sheehan's friends, and their friends, recruited through concentric 

e-mail list circles. The first participants were all from West Marin, but now 

they come from San Francisco, Berkeley and points beyond, all frustrated about 

not seeing their views represented.

<P>Making themselves so publicly vulnerable, Sheehan said, is a frantic 

semaphoric wave in the face of mainstream media indifference to the anti-war 

effort.

<P>She wasn't surprised that soon after she and her pals first began their 

protest, a CBS film crew came to visit. They were followed by calls from the 

BBC and radio stations from across the United States. Following their lead, 

copycat activists have stripped from Montana to Florida.

</table></font>Inspired by anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott and a group of <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0731-08.htm">Nigerian 

women -- who stared down Chevron officials there last summer</a> by threatening to 

disrobe unless village conditions improved -- Sheehan and the Unreasonables 

will be among the tens of thousands expected to attend a large anti-war march 

in San Francisco this Saturday.

<P>Vigilists like Singing for Peace and others have the same goal, just 

subtler tactics.

<P>They've joined longtime peace vigils like the Sunday walks around Oakland's 

Lake Merritt, which restarted a year ago after a 10-year hiatus, and groups of 

sign-wavers that convene in San Jose, Fremont and elsewhere.

<P>Some draw supportive honks and thumbs up. Other passers-by just shrug.

<P>On a recent Friday night outside the downtown Berkeley BART stop, 40 

smiling Singers for Peace members belted out "This Land Is Your Land."

<P>Not that a 25-year-old bookstore clerk, who asked to be identified only as 

Michael, heard them. He bolted past the ensemble, head down, the Grammy-

nominated "Nellyville" CD blasting through his headphones. Michael stiff-armed 

an offered flyer listing contact numbers for local members of Congress.

<P>"Do I support the war? No," Michael said a few steps away. "But this 

(vigil) isn't going to change my mind. Or anybody else's. It's Berkeley. 

There's always somebody opening their mouth and handing you something."

<P>Vigilists hear "What's the point?" questions a lot.

<P>Are the vigils going to change anybody's opinion in Washington? And, here 

in the left-leaning land that's re-elected congressional doves like Barbara 

Lee and Nancy Pelosi, aren't vigilists just singing to the regional choir?

<P>Vigil regulars respond that the civil rights movement was about hundreds of 

small gestures across the country. That public demonstrations, small and large,

<P>shaped public opinion and helped end the Vietnam War, apartheid and Soviet 

rule in Eastern Europe.

<P>Besides, they say, the Bay Area isn't a unified choir. Not only did Reps. 

Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, and Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, support a 

resolution authorizing President Bush to use force in Iraq, but vigil 

supporters regularly hear from hecklers.

<P>Almost as important, participants say displaying their opposition to war is 

an emotional outlet.

<P>"As for why people do it, I think it's 50 percent for themselves and 50 

percent for other people," said Betsy Rose, the Berkeley musician who 

organized Singing for Peace three months ago. She has taken it to weekly gigs 

at BART stops from Orinda to the Mission District.

<P>"But," she said, "I think we do need to get out to the suburbs more."

<P>Holding a vigil can be lonely outside the friendly confines of the San 

Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley axis of peace. Ask Ken Meyercord, a Pleasant Hill 

man who organized Sunday peace walks last year in Walnut Creek. They ended 

after three months and a peak turnout of 14 walkers.

<P>"But I'm not discouraged, because of all the support I heard from people 

out there," said Meyercord, a 58-year-old computer systems developer who lives 

"in a neighborhood where everybody's got a flag outside."

<P>He'll continue to seek ways to express his opposition to a war, like the 

time last year when he donned a Napoleonic outfit and flew an Earth flag over 

his boat -- right past Fleet Week spectators on San Francisco's Embarcadero.

<P>"I'm out there because a lot of other people are afraid to express their 

opinions publicly," Meyercord said. "A lot of Muslims have come up to us and 

thanked us, because we're saying what they'd like to, but are afraid."

<P>Bolstered by attendance from Green Party members, and students from South 

Bay Catholic schools, David Lowe has been joined by 40 folks at the weekly 

Friday evening vigils he's organized in San Jose for the past year. "When 

people just need some place to express themselves, we're here for them," Lowe 

said.

<P>While nearly all of the vigils are nonconfrontational, the California 

Highway Patrol has asked Webb Mealy to end his anti-war PowerPoint 

presentation on a pedestrian walkway over I-580 in Oakland, fearing that 

traffic would be impeded. He obliged.

<P>The 47-year-old, who took a sabbatical from his multimedia work nine months 

ago to devote time to the peace effort, was beaming to eastbound motorists a 

15-second message featuring the phrases "No Greed/No Hate/No War" and "Solar 

Power/Solar Peace."

<P>"I want to do my part," he said, "to persuade my fellow citizens that it's 

not ethically justifiable nor safe to go to war."

<P>It's a message that activists like Meany wish was easier to broadcast.</p>
