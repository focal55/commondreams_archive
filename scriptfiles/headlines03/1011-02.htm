  </table></font><font size="3">In light of Rush Limbaugh’s admission that he has a drug addiction, please see how harshly Limbaugh has lambasted drug addicts in the past. This unprecedented and astounding display of hypocrisy earns Limbaugh the first annual <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0502-14.htm">Bill Bennett Hypocrisy</a> Award. </font>
  <p>“<i>[He’s] <b>another dead drug addict</b>.</i>”

<br>
- Rush Limbaugh on Jerry Garcia, 8/11/95


<p><i>“There’s nothing good about drug use. We know it. It destroys individuals. It destroys families. Drug use destroys societies. <b>Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country</b>. And we have laws against selling drugs, pushing drugs, using drugs, importing drugs. And the laws are good because we know what happens to people in societies and neighborhoods which become consumed by them. And <b>so if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up.</b> What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug use. Too many whites are getting away with drug sales. Too many whites are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. <b>The answer to this disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we’re not putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send them up the river, too.</b>”

</i><br>
- Rush Limbaugh show, Oct. 5, 1995
<p><i>“I want to let you read along with me a quote from Jerry Colangelo about substance abuse, and I think you’ll find that he’s very much right…‘I know every expert in the world will disagree with me, but <b>I don’t buy into the disease part of it.</b> The first time you reach for a substance you are making a choice. Every time you go back, you are making a personal choice. I feel very strongly about that.’... What he’s saying is that if there’s a line of cocaine here, I have to make the choice to go down and sniff it….And his point is that <b>we are rationalizing all this irresponsibility and all the choices people are making and we’re blaming not them</b>, but society for it. All these Hollywood celebrities say the reason they’re weird and bizarre is because they were abused by their parents. So we’re going to pay for that kind of rehab, too, and we shouldn’t. <b>It’s not our responsibility.</b> It’s up to the people who are doing it. And Colangelo is right. We’ve got more - right after this.”</i>
