<p>When President Dwight Eisenhower was invited to address the still 
young United Nations 50 ago yesterday, he confronted a world poised on the 
brink of potentially devastating conflict. There had been war on the Korean 
Peninsula, a divided Germany was a superpower flashpoint, and the nuclear 
competition with the Soviets had blossomed into an unpredictable and ever more 
deadly arms race.
<P>But Eisenhower, the warrior, stunned many people on December 8, 1953, by 
offering what is still recognized as one of the most idealistic, if not dreamy,
disarmament proposals in history. It was a speech that planted seeds of hope, 
but also, many experts now agree, led to at least some of the gloom that 
exists, in the post 9/11 era, over what seems like the inevitable spread of 
nuclear weapons into hostile hands. 
<P>Eisenhower delivered an address called "Atoms for Peace," which, in its 
almost painfully formal and florid language, called on both the United States 
and the Soviets to eventually abandon their nuclear arsenals and hand over the 
secrets of the atom to a U.N. body that would use them to produce an age of 
prosperity and peace.
<P>He was committed, the ex-general said, to reversing "the fearful engines 
of atomic might" and countering "the hopeless finality of a belief that two 
atomic colossi are doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a 
trembling world."
<P>Instead, Eisenhower urged, the two powers should start handing over their 
uranium and other bomb-making materials to the newly created International 
Atomic Energy Agency and freely share nuclear technology with those who would 
apply it to commercial power generation, agriculture and medicine. 
<P>"The United States pledges before you  --  and therefore before the world 
--  its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma  --  to devote 
its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous 
inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to 
his life," the Republican president concluded. He was not alone in his hope 
that the nuclear genie could somehow be returned to the bottle. The spectacle 
of atomic warfare so terrified those who understood it that the push for 
disarmament dawned almost before the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had 
cooled. 
<P>On Oct. 3, 1945, less than two months after the first atomic bomb had 
been dropped, President Harry Truman wrote to Congress, "The hope of 
civilization lies in international arrangements looking, if possible, to the 
renunciation of the use and development of the atomic bomb."
<P>The difference was that while Truman's proposals for cooperative atomic 
research made little headway, Eisenhower's ideas generated concrete programs. 
<P>While mutual suspicion prevented Washington and Moscow from abandoning 
their nuclear arsenals  --  at its peak, the United States fielded more than 
32,000 warheads  --  they did implement a series of treaties reducing those 
numbers. 
<P>The two sides also agreed to share what they considered to be the 
benefits of the atom. But what Eisenhower envisioned as the road to 
unprecedented prosperity turned into a Faustian bargain. 
<P>Under the Atoms for Peace program, countries that renounced nuclear 
weapons development were given research reactors and other nuclear 
technologies. But what were supposed to be benevolent gestures turned into 
another form of competition, as the United States and the Soviets began 
rewarding their friends with what became an international status symbol  --  
research reactors. 
<P>At the same time, there was too little policing of what those countries 
did with the reactors. The programs became training grounds for weapons 
scientists who, in some instances, produced bomb-making materials.
<P>A bizarre range of countries, including the Congo, Ghana, Jamaica, Peru, 
Syria, Turkey, Bangladesh, Algeria and Colombia, were provided reactors by 
both countries. The Soviets also spread them around Eastern Europe. 
<P>In a paper delivered to a scientific conference on the anniversary of 
Atoms for Peace, Leonard Weiss, a consultant at the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, explained how the U.S. all but gave nuclear weapons to 
India by training Indian scientists and providing reactor technology and 
materials.
<P>"The world has paid a price for the early euphoric embrace of Atoms for 
Peace, when the spread of nuclear technology was unaccompanied by adequate 
consideration of proliferation risks," wrote Weiss.
<P>The temptation by the superpowers to maintain stockpiles of nuclear 
weapons has also proven overpowering. Washington and Moscow have negotiated 
treaties banning the possession of biological and chemical weapons, also known 
as weapons of mass destruction, but not the significantly more destructive 
nuclear warheads. 
<P>Still, some experts argue, things could have been worse. In the early 
1960s, President John F. Kennedy had predicted that there might be 25 nuclear 
states or more in a decade or so. Today, there are nine known nuclear states  -
-  the United States, Russia, France, Britain, China, India, Pakistan, Israel 
and (probably) North Korea. The majority of them are democracies, or close to 
it.
<P>The Atoms for Peace concept also spawned the inspections programs 
conducted by the IAEA, for instance, and helped lay the groundwork for the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970. However imperfect, the treaty helped 
roll back nuclear weapons programs that had once existed in Argentina, Brazil, 
Taiwan, South Africa and South Korea.
<P>"In the final analysis," wrote Peter Lavoy, an arms expert at the Naval 
Postgraduate School, in the December issue of Arms Control Today, "Eisenhower 
was no more or less successful than his successors in trying to balance the 
possession and possible use of nuclear forces for America's defense with 
efforts to discourage other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons."</p>
