<p>New evidence found by teams of climate researchers leaves no doubt 
that industrial emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing 
global temperatures  --  an ominous trend that has speeded up in the past 50 
years and threatens to continue for centuries, according to a report by two of 
the nation's leading atmospheric scientists.
<P>The two government experts said climate change "may prove to be 
humanity's greatest challenge" and warned that "it is very unlikely to be 
adequately addressed without greatly improved international cooperation and 
action."

</table>Thomas Karl, a meteorologist at the National Climatic Data Center in 
Asheville, N.C., and Kevin Trenberth, chief of the climate analysis section at 
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., are publishing 
their analysis in Friday's edition of the journal Science.
<P>Neither scientist criticized the Bush administration's refusal to ratify 
the Kyoto treaty, which is designed to regulate emissions of heat-trapping 
greenhouse gases worldwide. But their published comments reflected the growing 
concerns of most climate experts over the White House stance.
<P>The two disagreed with assertions by some scientists that swings in 
worldwide temperatures over the years are normal and natural. "Modern climate 
change is dominated by human influences, which are now large enough to exceed 
the bounds of natural variability," they said.
<P>Karl and Trenberth also agreed that many uncertainties remained about how 
swiftly global temperatures are rising, how much they are likely to rise and 
how long ago the problem began.
<P>However, "there is no doubt," they say, "that the composition of the 
atmosphere is changing because of human activities, and today greenhouse gases 
are the largest human influence on global climate.''
<P>They estimate that by the end of this century there is a 90 percent 
chance that the world's climate will heat up between 3.1 and 8.9 degrees 
Fahrenheit because of those human influences.
<P>Among the consequences, they predict, are more frequent heat waves, more 
widespread droughts in some parts of the world and "extreme precipitation 
events" in others.
<P>They also predict more wildfires, abrupt changes in vegetation and 
continued melting of glaciers and of the great Greenland Ice Sheet, causing 
floods along many continental coastlines.
<P>Additionally, as snow cover melts on land and icebergs shrink at sea, 
both the darker ground and the darker ocean surfaces will be exposed to solar 
radiation, increasing temperatures even more, the climate forecasters say.
<P>While some climate analysts have noted that the vast quantities of soot 
emitted by many industries and volcanic eruptions can actually cool the 
atmosphere, that kind of cooling can last only a few years, with little or no 
effect on the long-range trend, the scientists say.
<P>The report by Karl and Trenberth adds new data to scores of previous 
international studies and computer models of future climate changes as well as 
analyses by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
<P>The new conclusions met with some disagreement Wednesday from James 
Mahoney, a noted meteorologist and the Bush administration's assistant 
secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, who directs all the 
government's weather and climate research and forecasting agencies.
<P>In a telephone interview, Mahoney agreed that climate change is indeed a 
global problem that "has no political boundaries." He noted that the United 
States has a large delegation of experts attending an international conference 
on climate change in Milan right now.
<P>Mahoney also insisted that the United States under President Bush had 
developed a "substantial involvement" in international activities aimed at 
researching the problems of global warming and at resolving their 
uncertainties.
<P>But he took issue with Karl's and Trenberth's insistence that there's 
clear evidence that human activity far outstrips natural variation as the main 
cause of global warming.
<P>"That's their assertion," Mahoney said. "They are extremely competent, 
and there are many in the climate community who would agree with them. That's 
not surprising, but there are many others who would disagree with them. My own 
view is somewhat more open-minded, and from my perspective we don't really 
understand these things as well as we might.''
<P>No one disputes that there has been a sharp rise in carbon dioxide levels 
in the atmosphere during the past decades, Mahoney said, "but there remains 
disagreement about just how severe its impact has been."
<P>As to the grim future that Karl and Trenberth see as a result of global 
warming, "I do challenge them on that," Mahoney said, "because all future 
projections are based on many, many models of how the atmosphere behaves, and 
I think a number of skeptical scientists would also challenge them."</p>
