<p>Kellee Hom was raised in the Roman Catholic Church but never 
imagined she'd become a religious none.
<P>No, not "nun." That's "none," as in "none of the above." 
<P>Hom is among a growing number of Americans who simply answer "none" or 
"no religion" when pollsters ask them their religious affiliation. Some 
"nones" identify themselves as atheists or agnostics, but the vast majority 
believe in God, pray and often describe themselves as "spiritual but not 
religious." 
<P>"My sense of God transcends all the different religions,'' said Hom, a 
clinical supervisor at Asian American Recovery Services in San Francisco, 
which helps people with substance-abuse problems. "It's an energy."

  </table></font>Nones are one of the fastest growing religious categories in the United 
States. 
<P>According to a recent survey, their ranks have more than doubled in a 
decade and include about 29 million Americans.
<P>They're easy to find in the West and are the single largest religious 
group in Oregon and Washington, where they make up 21 and 25 percent of the 
population, respectively.
<P>California is not far behind. Nearly one in five people in the Golden 
State (19 percent) say they are nones. Only the Catholic Church (with 32 
percent) outnumbers the nones. 
<P>Mark Shibley, a sociologist at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, has 
studied the nones of the Pacific Coast. "The West is a vast place 
geographically, which has made it harder for religious institutions to pervade 
the landscape and corner the market," he said. "There's a sense of space  --  
an openness  --  in this culture."
<P>There are other reasons. People on the West Coast tend to be from 
somewhere else. They tear up roots when they move out West, including their 
religious roots. But this is not just a West Coast fluke. 
<P>What has gotten the attention of many scholars is the sharp increase in 
the number of Americans nationwide who now claim no loyalty to a single faith. 
<P>The shift has been noted in several polls, including the American 
Religious Identification Survey of 2001, conducted by the City University of 
New York. This telephone survey of 50,000 Americans, which was also conducted 
in 1990, asked the open-ended question, "What is your religion, if any."
<P>Based on those answers, the study estimated that the number of "no 
religion" Americans had jumped from 14 million in 1990 to 29 million in 2001.
<P>Out of that 29 million, only 900,000 would call themselves atheists. 
Those 29 million nones are outnumbered only by the 51 million Americans who 
call themselves Catholic and 34 million who say they are Baptist.

</table>Two sociologists at UC Berkeley, Michael Hout and Claude Fischer, believe 
the rise of the religious nones has more to do with politics than declining 
piety.
<P>"In the 1990s, many people who had weak attachment to religion and either 
moderate or liberal political views found themselves at odds with the 
conservative political agenda of the Christian Right and reacted by renouncing 
their weak attachment to organized religion,'' they write in the American 
Sociological Review.
<P>Robert Fuller, the author of "Spiritual but Not Religious: Understanding 
Unchurched America," also questions whether American belief has really changed 
that much in a single decade.
<P>Fuller, a professor of religious studies at Bradley University in Peoria, 
Ill., said the survey might just show that people were getting more 
comfortable saying they have no religion.
<P>"They may have always been there," Fuller said. "But having a critical 
mass of like-minded people gives them a social reference group.'' 
<P>Many of the nation's religious nones have become dissatisfied with the 
beliefs and practices of the Judeo-Christian mainstream. 
<P>Hom, the addiction counselor in San Francisco, was raised by a Buddhist 
father and Baptist mother who sent her to Catholic school. "They made us feel 
guilty if we didn't go to church on Sunday," said Hom, 33. "It felt like an 
obligation rather than something I was choosing to do."
<P>Hom said she had fallen away from the Catholic Church because she felt 
its teachings "were unfair to women." She also couldn't accept the idea that 
"innocent babies are born with original sin."
<P>Alan Drummer, a father of two in Burlingame, was raised in the Church of 
Christian Science, but left when he was 12 years old. 
<P>Now 46, Drummer and his wife, Charlene, have two children, a 5-year-old 
and a 17 -month-old. Concerned about religious education for the kids, the 
couple have been church-shopping on the Peninsula, but they don't like what 
they see.
<P>"Sunday school can be so doctrinaire and restrictive," Drummer said. "We 
think we may just give them a religious education on our own, visiting 
different religious groups. No single religion has the only true 
interpretation of God.'' 
<P>"I see truth and beauty at the core of most religions,'' Drummer added. 
<P>Bruce Meservey, who lives in San Francisco and works for an insurance 
company, was raised in the Catholic Church. He says he left because of "its 
hypocrisy and inability to address major concerns of mine.''
<P>Now 52, Meservey says he is definitely a religious none. 
<P>"I believe, but I don't know what  --  just in the universe as an entity,
" he said. "I don't know if I believe in heaven or hell. It's all so ambiguous.
<P>"I believe in karma,'' he said after a pause. "Don't screw you neighbor. 
It will come back to you one way or another. I pray once in a while. I kind of 
believe in a supreme being, but if you start trying to pin me down ...
<P>"We are all part of the same thing,'' he added. "We are all part of each 
other and the animals and the Earth  --  all part of one big thing.''</p>
