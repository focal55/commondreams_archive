<p>BAGHDAD Jan 12   - Four relatives of U.S. victims  of the Sept. 11 attacks ended a peace mission to Baghdad on  Sunday with a call on world leaders to use some imagination to  find ways to avoid war in the Iraq crisis.<p>



		"The Iraqi people have used great imagination to make do  with what very little they have these days," Colleen Kelly, a  New York nurse who lost a brother on Sept. 11, 2001, told  reporters at the end of a six-day trip to a country crippled by  12 years of U.N. sanctions.<p>



		"We'd like to call upon governments around the world to  also use their imagination," Kelly said. Her group visited  hospitals, universities and schools in Baghdad and the city of  Basra in the far south.<p>

</table></font>Washington is massing troops in the Gulf ahead of a  possible invasion unless Iraq gives up chemical, biological and  nuclear weapons that Baghdad says it does not have.<p>



		The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of  Kuwait, have impoverished the oil-rich country which says  hundreds of thousands of children have died because of lack of  medicines.<p>



		The Bush administration has said it seeks "regime change"  in Iraq, under 23-years rule of President Saddam Hussein who  Washington thinks could put doomsday weapons in the hands of  anti-U.S. Islamic groups.<p>



		"You can make changes without war and that's what we're  challenging our leaders to do," said Kathleen Tinley, a student  whose uncle died when suspected Islamic militants slammed  hijacked aircraft into the World Trade Center towers in New  York.<p>



		The women are members of the anti-war Peaceful Tomorrows  group set up by families of September 11 victims.<p>



		Baghdad has seen a stream of solidarity groups visit in  recent weeks and has promised that some activists will act as  "human shields" against a U.S. attack.<p>



		"Personally, I will stay," said Bret Eartheart, a  construction worker from Indiana who is a member of an  international anti-war group called the Iraq Peace Team.<p>



		"There are a lot of options and for me war is not the best  of them," he said.
