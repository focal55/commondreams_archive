<p>Kurds oppose any form of Turkish military deployment in Iraq, according to an official from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.

  </table></font></font>Barham Salih made clear that foreign military forces in occupied Iraq could not guarantee security for the population and that a Turkish presence would only deteriorate an already bad situation.
<p>His comments were published on Tuesday in Iraq’s al-Sabah newspaper.   
<p>"Turkish troops will face difficulties if they enter Iraq, because the majority of Iraqi groups do not want any military participation from any neighbouring country," he said. 
   
<p><b>No military assistance
</b>
<p>Ruling out military assistance, Salih said Turkey would have a role to play in rebuilding a free and unoccupied Iraq.

<p>"The Iraqi people seek political and economic help from Turkey, but not military," said Salih, who is in Ankara.

<p>The official said his comments were representative of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and its leader, Jalal Talibani. 
   
<p><b>Parliament vote
</b>
<p>The Turkish parliament is expected to vote on Tuesday on a troop deployment to Iraq.

<p>The operation could start as early as next month and last for up to a year, according to Turkish press reports. 
  
<p>The government motion, which has sparked sharp public opposition, does not specify how many soldiers would be sent and to which part of Iraq.

  </table></font></font>But the popular Vatan daily said 6000 soldiers - from units in Ankara and from the neighbouring province of Cankiri - would initially be deployed, starting in November.

<p>If Parliament does agree, Turkey will become the first predominantly Muslim nation to contribute troops to the US-led occupation. 

<p><b>Hostile opposition
</b>
<p>But many lawmakers reject the idea of sending troops, having opposed the war that ousted former president Saddam Hussein from the beginning. 

<p>Many parliamentarians doubt whether their soldiers - consisting mainly of conscripts - should risk dying for a mission they do not support. A recent opinion poll indicated that 64.4% of Turks oppose sending troops.

<p>However, Ankara seems determined to help out the US-led occupation.

<p>Government spokesman Cemil Cicek would not disclose how many soldiers might be sent, but officials have said the United States has requested about 10,000. 

<p>The number "will be assessed according to needs," Cicek said.
 
<p><b>US security assurance
</b>
<p>The Turkish government has received assurances from the US State Department's “counterterrorism” chief, Cofer Black, that the United States will remove the threat posed by Kurdish rebels of the autonomy-seeking Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, based in northern Iraq.

<p>But Barham Salih says no one is in a position to guarantee anybody’s security in Iraq.

<p>Most of northern Iraq is in the hands of two mainstream Kurdish parties - the PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
