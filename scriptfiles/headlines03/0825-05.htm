<p>Prime Minister John Howard denied a report here that Australia is under pressure from the United States to consider a fresh contribution to coalition forces in Iraq.

<p>The Australian newspaper reported that US officials were using informal channels to keep the issue of deploying more Australian troops on the bilateral agenda of Canberra and Washington.

<p>But Howard told reporters during a visit to the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara that he was not aware of any requests by the United States, formal or otherwise, for more Australian troops in Iraq.

<p>Australia had made it clear from the outset of the invasion that Australia would "not be in a position to contribute a large number of peacekeepers", he said.

<p>Australia currently has 852 defence personnel deployed in the Iraq conflict, including troops on security duties, RAAF air traffic controllers and a naval frigate on patrol in the Gulf.

<p>Washington is looking to the international community to supply peacekeepers to help police a power vacuum created by the ousting of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein from power.

<p>An Australian expert on terrorism, David Wright-Neville of Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Unit, said Iraq was becoming more dangerous and the situation there would become worse before it improved.

<p>"That's a decision that the government will have to make, and I'm sure that they'd be very nervous about that decision," Wright-Neville told the Channel Nine television network.

<p>"The situation on the ground in Iraq appears to be deteriorating for a number of reasons."

<p>He said remnants of Saddam Hussein's forces remained determined to draw the Americans and British into a prolonged guerilla war, while evidence had emerged that Iraq had become a magnet for terrorists around the world.

<p>"So that's an environment that I think would worry the Australian government if they were asked to recommit troops to the region."
