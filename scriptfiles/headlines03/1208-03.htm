<p>Large employers in Northern California saw their average health care 
costs rise 12.3 percent in 2003, and they expect those costs to jump an 
additional 15.4 percent next year, according to a survey being released today 
by a human resource consulting firm.
<P>Those rate hikes  --  driven by factors such as changes in medical 
technology and rising drug costs  --  are higher than what large employers 
nationwide reported in a survey by the Mercer Human Resource Consulting of 
employer-sponsored health plans. Employers with 500 or more workers estimated 
a 10.2 percent hike in health care costs this year and a 12.5 percent increase 
in 2004.

</table>Facing a fourth year of double-digit premium hikes, companies have been 
getting tough this year, pushing a lot more of those costs back onto their 
employees in the form of higher co-payments and other cost-sharing 
arrangements. Recognizing the limitations of those tactics, the survey found 
employers looking to longer-term solutions and possible government 
intervention to head off the unrelenting increases. 
<P>"Costs have been going up, and they're not stopping," said Kirby Hutson, 
a Mercer consultant based in San Francisco. "Employers had been absorbing a 
lot of the cost increases. It seemed like in 2003, they got pretty darn 
aggressive in shifting those costs to employees."
<P>Although Northern California employers appear to be more pessimistic 
about health care costs than employers nationwide, Hutson cautioned against 
drawing any broad conclusions because the Northern California sample was based 
on just 56 employers with more than 500 workers.
<P>Among 3,000 businesses  --  both large and small  --  that participated 
in the nationwide survey, total health benefit costs rose 10.1 percent in 2003.
<P>The average expected increase in 2004 is 13 percent, according to the survey, 
which is considered the oldest and largest of its kind. As high as those 
increases appear, they have come down from the nearly 15 percent hike reported 
by survey participants in 2002 and the 14 percent they predicted for this year.
<P>Huston said the fact that this year's rates came below what was forecast 
was not due to any reduction in health care costs but to aggressive shifting 
of some of those costs onto employees through higher premium sharing, co-
payments and other costs. Dropping costly plans, reducing covered services and 
changing the design of existing plans were some of the other tactics employers 
used to curb costs.
<P>The average contribution from a single employee on a health maintenance 
organization plan, or HMO, rose from 31 percent of the premium last year to 35 
percent this year, and the family contribution increased from 50 percent to 57 
percent. For some employees, those higher contributions may mean a reduction 
in total compensation because salaries have increased on average by just 3 
percent.
<P>Family coverage for the costlier but more flexible preferred provider 
organization plans, or PPOs increased from 53 percent to 58 percent from last 
year to 2003, while single coverage remained the same at 27 percent, the 
survey found.
<P>In dollars, that means the average U.S. worker kicked in $101 a month for 
an HMO and $82 for a PPO this year. Families paid $352 for the HMO and $381 
for the PPO.
<P>Among large Northern California employers, the average employee-only 
contribution for an HMO in 2003 was $44 and $84 for a PPO, according to the 
survey. Families contributed $161 a month for an HMO and $205 for a PPO. 
<P>Premiums in California generally remain lower than in many other parts of 
the country because of the state's higher penetration rate of lower-cost HMOs. 
But Huston said the state, especially Northern California, has come under 
mounting cost pressures from the increased negotiating power for rates that 
hospital and groups have gained from consolidating their operations.
<P>Another survey of employer health costs issued last week found that firms 
expect a 14 percent increase in health care costs. In the survey of 650 major 
U.S. companies by Hewitt Associates, the employers said they can only afford 
to absorb an increase of 9 percent.
<P>Just how long employers can continue to shift costs remains to be seen.
<P>"There's obviously some limitations, in terms of employee revolt or at 
least in terms of employee relations. But we are in a pretty tight economy, 
and employers feel like they can do more of this cost shifting," Hutson said. 
"It's painful to them ... but employees are starting to expect it as well." 
<P>Hutson said some longer-range solutions obviously need to be found, 
whether through government intervention or other employer-sponsored methods 
such as disease-management programs.
<P>The survey questioned companies about whether or not they favored 
legislation that would require employers to offer a baseline medical benefit 
to all their workers. 
<P>It found there wasn't much employer support for such a plan in California, where former Gov. Gray Davis signed an employer-mandated health care law just 
before he was ousted in the recall election. While 42 percent of businesses 
nationwide said they favored such a law, complete with employer tax benefits 
and subsidies for low-income workers, just 28 percent of California businesses 
surveyed expressed their support.
<P>Many employers and health experts believe that requiring employees to 
pick up more of their health care tab and pay more for more expensive plans 
makes them more cost-sensitive and conscientious health care consumers.
<P>On the other hand, a study released last week by the Center for Studying 
Health System Change, a nonpartisan think tank, warned that low-income workers 
and people with serious illnesses will be hardest hit by increased out-of-
pocket expenses and other cost-sharing measures.
