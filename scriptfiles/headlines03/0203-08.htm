<p>Thousands of area residents demonstrating against a potential U.S. war in Iraq filled the streets of Palo Alto on Saturday afternoon in a gathering that organizers described as “the largest peace demonstration ever seen on the San Francisco Peninsula.”<P>

	About 50 Stanford students walked from Hoover Tower to join the antiwar demonstration, which began at noon in front of Palo Alto City Hall.<P>

</table></font>Among the many speakers at City Hall was sophomore Caroline Picker of the Stanford Community for Peace and Justice, who told the crowd that the conservative Hoover Institution should disaffiliate with Stanford.<P>

	“The military-academic complex will not stand,” she said. “We demand that the link between these right-wing, hawkish ideas [at the Hoover Institution] and our university be broken.”<P>

	History Prof. Joel Beinin attacked U.S. intervention in Middle East affairs since the Gulf War.<P>

	“A democratic country, such as the one the United States aspires to be, does not need and cannot be an empire,” he said, drawing a positive vocal response from the crowd.<P>

	A spokesperson for Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Ca.) expressed solidarity with the protesters, saying that the Bush administration’s unilateral approach was misguided.<P>

	The rally drew a large, diverse crowd, despite the day’s blustering winds and the announcement that singer Joan Baez — who had been given top billing in the rally’s publicity — could not attend due to illness.<P>

	The Palo Alto Police Department did not provide an official count, but a police officer estimated the crowd, which filled the plaza in front of City Hall, to number about 4,000. The rally’s sponsor, the Palo Alto-based Peninsula Peace and Justice Center, said 5,000 people attended.<P>

	Among the demonstrators was Anne Dochez, a high school teacher from Los Altos who said she had been involved the Vietnam-era antiwar movement. She called that war “a tragedy for our country as well as theirs.”<P>

	“I don’t want that happening again,” she said.<P>

	Lena Dekesel, a Belgian who has lived in the United States for 18 years, said her friends and family in Europe are “against the war and Bush, but they don’t believe that Americans are opposed to it.”<P>

	She added, “I cannot vote, but I want to be heard.”<P>

	Many of the demonstrators bore signs and slogans that have become familiar in such rallies, including “Say no to war,” and “No blood for oil.” But third-year law student Bryce Giddens waved a Palestinian flag instead of a sign.<P>

	“Bush claims to be in favor of liberating the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein,” Giddens said. “And yet, at the same time, he supports the oppression of Palestinians.”<P>

	The rally began on a somber note with a moment of silence held for the seven astronauts who perished aboard the space shuttle Columbia earlier in the day. The protest continued with nearly two hours of antiwar speeches. Near the end of that time, protesters anxious to start the next phase of the demonstration shouted “Let’s march!” from the rear.<P>

	The march, which lasted only about 20 minutes, began at City Hall. The crowd followed Ramona Street and turned onto University Avenue, where some shopkeepers and pedestrians smiled and waved in support while others simply watched. After walking two blocks along University Avenue — which the police had blocked to traffic — the crowd turned on to Waverly Street and headed along Hamilton Avenue before returning back to City Hall. The marchers were orderly throughout.<P>

	“It’s so inspiring to see all these people united,” said sophomore Jonathan Fetter, his voice hoarse from chanting. As he marched, Fetter bore a sign that read “Resist the State.”<P>

	Near him marched Palo Alto resident John Skinner, a Vietnam veteran with a 9-year old son.<P>

	“It’s encouraging to see so many people here,” he said. “It raises my spirits.”<P>

	The march was followed by a concert in front of City Hall, where many demonstrators listened and lingered before dispersing. Among them was Kelly Kobza, a sixth grade teacher at J.L. Stanford Middle School. She stood side by side with four friends, each wearing a frame backpack supporting a large piece of poster board labeled on each side with one letter of the phrase “No War,” and on the other side, “Peace.” <P>

	Kobza said that her views are unlikely to change, regardless of whatever arguments the Bush administration makes. <P>

	“I will never be persuaded that war is the answer,” she said, referring to Secretary of State Colin Powell’s highly anticipated Feb. 5 effort to present compelling evidence against Saddam Hussein to the U.N. Security Council.<P>

	Scanning the plaza, she added, “This is the crowd I was hoping for.”
