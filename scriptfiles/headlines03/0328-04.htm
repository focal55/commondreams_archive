<p>The top US infantry commander in Iraq has said that his troops'

overstretched supply lines, coupled with unexpectedly stiff Iraqi

resistance, had stalled the advance on Baghdad and increased the

possibility of a long war. <P>Contradicting the upbeat assessments from the Pentagon, which

repeatedly insisted Operation Iraqi Freedom was on schedule,

Lieutenant General William Wallace said his troops had been taken

by surprise by Iraqi irregulars using guerrilla tactics.<P>"The enemy we're fighting is different from the one we'd war-gamed

against," said Lt Gen Wallace, the commander of the US army's V

Corps overseeing ground operations.<P>When asked whether the resistance would lead to a longer than

predicted war, he said: "It's beginning to look that way."<P>The off-message remarks brought to the surface unease among army

officials that the 300-mile supply lines between the leading US

forces and logistics bases in Kuwait are too vulnerable to mount a

decisive assault on Baghdad.<P>Troops of the 3rd Infantry Division spent much of the past week

fighting their way up the Euphrates, and have told journalists with

them that they are short of fuel and food.<P>The Washington Post also quoted army sources as expressing concern

at the gap opening up between the army, advancing along the west

bank of the Euphrates, and the US marines moving towards Kut

170km due east on the Tigris.<P>There were 125,000 coalition troops in Iraq as of yesterday,

25,000 of them British.<P>Another 40,000 were reported ready to move over the border from

Kuwait.<P>Some 60,000 US troops have deployment orders, but the first

batch, the 4th Infantry Division, is only due to be ready for battle in

mid-April.<P>Hours earlier, France's normally mild-mannered prime minister

Jean-Pierre Raffarin delivered a stinging attack on the campaign,

saying it could become a bloodbath.<P>Mr Raffarin said: "We were expecting a technological war, a quick

war, a 21st century war. And we have discovered a war that is

among the most horrible, like those of the 20th century.<P>"We are seeing there are major consequences in the horrors of a war

that is taking place before our very eyes, in conditions we did not

expect."<P>Equivalent views were expressed yesterday by the Iraqi regime. The

defense minister predicted that the siege of Baghdad could begin in

five days, but vowed that American soldiers would become entangled

in months of bloody street fighting.

<P>Sultan Hashim Ahmed was speaking in Baghdad as US infantry were

told to prepare for a potentially decisive battle in the next 72 hours

with the Republican Guard near the holy Shia city of Kerbala.<P>US warplanes and missiles destroyed communications and command

centers in the Iraqi capital before dawn this morning, the US central

command said. Reporters spoke of several thunderous explosions

early today, shaking the center of the city.

<P>The Iraqi minister was speaking a day after 1,000 US paratroopers

opened a northern front by landing on a Kurdish-held airfield.<P>The first response to the arrival of the 173rd Airborne Brigade

came last night with a surprise retreat by Iraqi forces from

positions defending the northern oil city of Kirkuk. Kurdish rebel

troops moved in quickly to take their trenches.<P>The brigade is there to allow tanks of the 1st Infantry Division to be

flown in, but US officials said that it was expected to be a light force

intended to deter Turkish intervention and perhaps secure northern

oilfields.<P>Nevertheless, Donald Rumsfeld, the US defense secretary, appeared

determined that the US infantry should take on the Republican

Guard's Medina Division dug in around Kerbala. The division was

subjected to near constant bombing yesterday as coalition planes

flew 600 sorties, taking advantage of the return of good weather.

<P>"I think it's only reasonable to expect that it will require the

coalition forces moving through some Republican Guard units and

destroying them or capturing them before you'll see the crumbling

of the regime," Mr Rumsfeld said.<P>The Pentagon's strategy of launching a lightning assault on Baghdad

with only one heavy infantry division, with two relatively light

airborne and marine divisions also available, also came under fire

in Washington and London yesterday.<P>Before the war, the CIA and the DIA (defense intelligence agency)

were reported to have warned Mr Rumsfeld that an invasion might

be met with tenacious guerrilla resistance.

<P>Those warnings were ignored in favor of more optimistic

assessments from Iraqi opposition exiles, according to a report in

the Washington Post. Meanwhile, serving and retired army officers

have privately warned that the US commander, Gen Tommy Franks,

did not have enough troops in reserve to protect his supply lines and

deal with the guerrilla threat.

<P>The 4th Infantry Division, originally earmarked for deployment in

Turkey, is due to begin arriving in Kuwait at the weekend, but their

tanks and artillery will still take up to three weeks to arrive by

ship. Asked whether Britain would send reinforcements to Iraq, the

British defense secretary, Geoff Hoon, replied: "We are absolutely

confident that we have sufficient forces in theatre to deliver the

military objectives that we set out."

<P>The Guardian has learned that an infantry brigade of some 5,000

troops is on standby if required.<P>Meanwhile, in the north near Mosul, the Iraqi soldiers who had been

encamped in bunkers overlooking the town of Chamchamal staged an

orderly withdrawal yesterday.<P>Their unexpected retreat illustrates the Iraqi army's growing

confidence that it can best defeat coalition forces by luring them into

Iraq's cities<P>The Iraqi defense minister told a news conference: "It will be no

surprise that in five to 10 days they &#91;US troops&#93; will be able to

encircle all our positions in Baghdad_ But they have to come into the

city eventually.

<P>"The enemy can bypass the resistance and go into the desert as far as

it wants. &#91;But&#93; in the end, where can he go? He has to enter the

city."</p>
