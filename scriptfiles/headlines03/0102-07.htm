<p>Seeking to &quot;reinvigorate the buzz across the country&quot; from 

    its <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1117-02.htm">first photo</a> of women spelling &quot;Peace&quot; with their naked bodies, 

    organizer Donna Sheehan and her group, Unreasonable Women Baring Witness, 

    staged a second, much larger nude peace protest and photo shoot near Point 

    Reyes Station on Sunday. </p>

  <p>The sandy shore of Drake&#146;s Beach, rather than a rain-sogged Love 

    Field in Point Reyes Station, was the venue for some 94 women along with more 

    than two dozen men who created two new and separate signs for peace.</p>

  <p>Many women who participated in this weekend&#146;s photo said they either 

    didn&#146;t hear of the first event until it was over, or couldn&#146;t attend 

    because it was during the week. </p>

  <p>&quot;I was impressed with the first one,&quot; said Mary Prudhomme of 

    Inverness and San Francisco, who said she felt like Americans opposed to the 

    White House&#146;s war plans are living in a silent majority. Prudhomme decided 

    to join the second event. </p>

  <p>&quot;I just thought, &#145;this is something I wanted to do.&#146; I 

    have no clue if this will make a difference but figured any kind of publicity 

    can&#146;t be bad,&quot; said Prudhomme.</p>

  <p>Though the first photo enjoyed a splash of success, being picked up in 

    local, national, and international news outlets, even organizer Sheehan conceded 

    the first photograph was &quot;media-dead.&quot; </p>

  <p>Invigorated with determination to prevent war with Iraq and a ever-growing 

    populate of participants, Sheehan said she decided to continue the campaign 

    for non-violence with another, much larger &quot;Peace&quot; photo.</p>

  <p>&quot;The more we do, the better,&quot; said Bolinas resident Vivienne 

    Verdon-Roe, who said the first photo inspired Bolinas residents to stage their 

    own version of a &quot;Peace&quot; photo, albeit fully-dressed and incorporating 

    children and dogs. A second Bolinas photo is slated for Saturday, Jan. 11, 

    where all who participate will create a &quot;No War&quot; sign with their 

    clothed bodies.</p>

  <p align="left"><B>Bonded at shoot</B></p>

  <p>Along with creating a statement for peace, the participants also bonded 

    at this weekend&#146;s shoot. </p>

  <p>&quot;There&#146;s a certain level of defiance, and it&#146;s also just 

    a fun thing to do,&quot; she said. &quot;And after the shot, we all got a 

    little wet to get the sand off.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It was automatic,&quot; said local singer and Point Reyes Station 

    resident Rhiannon of camaraderie after the protest photo. &quot;We all ran 

    into the cold, glorious water. It was a great moment. We were washing each 

    other off &#150; The whole thing was very body, very human, very physical. 

    And at the same time, we felt we were doing the best we can to represent the 

    humans who don&#146;t want to go to war.&quot;</p>

  <p>While the women were comfortable with the second go, the men&#146;s shoot 

    was a new experience for all involved.</p>

  <p>Participant Paul Reffell, despite an air of nervousness and uncertainty, 

    said he walked away feeling enthusiastic over the experience of men forming 

    a peace symbol with their bodies.</p>

  <p>&quot;Once we were there, we started feeling like we were involved in 

    something different,&quot; said Reffell. &quot;It was like family. It was 

    just a wonderful thing.&quot; </p>

  <p align="left"><B>Big event planned</B></p>

  <p>Organizers said Sunday&#146;s gathering is only the beginning for Baring 

    Witness, as the group plans to demonstrate in the nude as part of a mass demonstration 

    called the National March on Saturday, Jan. 18 on Market Street in San Francisco 

    and in Washington DC. Event organizers said they hope up to more than 100,000 

    people participate at both demonstrations, naked or clothed.</p>

  <p>In addition to lead photographer Jan Watson of Point Reyes Station, the 

    event was captured by photographers Christopher Springman and Oscar-winner 

    John Korty, both of Point Reyes Station, as well as Michel Fraser of San Francisco 

  </p>

  <p>A film documentary of the group&#146;s efforts to impact politics through 

    naked protest and imagery is also underway, Sheehan said.</p>

  <p> Until the demonstration in January, Sheehan and her partner Reffell 

    will continue spending their time &quot;coaching and inspiring&quot; other 

    people in nearly a dozen cities to create their own &quot;peace&quot; photos.</p>
