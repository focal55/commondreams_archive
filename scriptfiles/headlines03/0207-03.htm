<p>The United States attorney general, John Ashcroft, has overruled his own federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for 28 defendants, in what has been criticized as a drive to spread capital punishment into states that have resisted it.

<P>In one case Mr Ashcroft demanded that prosecutors renege on a deal made with a defendant in a murder trial to drop their demand for the death penalty in return for testimony against a Colombian drug ring.</P>

<P>The attorney general, arguably the most conservative member of a rightwing administration, has also declared he will seek a death sentence for Brian Regan, an intelligence analyst arrested in 2001 for trying to sell secrets to Iraq, Libya and China. He would be the first espionage defendant to face execution since Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.</P>

<P>Mr Ashcroft has also played a leading role in arranging for the defendants in the Washington sniper case, Lee Malvo and John Muhammad, to face charges in Virginia, which has a high rate of executions, rather than Maryland, where most of the killings occurred but which had temporarily suspended the death penalty.</P>

<P>A national network of defense lawyers, the federal death penalty resource counsel project, has counted 28 cases in which Mr Ashcroft has insisted on the death penalty, against the judgment of the federal prosecutors involved. His predecessor, Janet Reno, intervened in 26 cases over five years.</P>

<P>"There are more federal 

cases approved for the death penalty by the attorney general than there have ever been before," said Dick Burr, a Texas defense lawyer and a member of the project. "He's acting like a Texas politician, but then of course, he works for one.</P>

<P>The justice department did not return calls for comment, but a spokeswoman issued a statement saying the people involved in reviewing death penalty decisions in Washington "have the benefit of seeing the landscape of these cases nationwide, thereby ensuring consistency".</P>

<P>Almost half the cases in which Mr Ashcroft intervened were in New York and Connecticut, states traditionally been reluctant to execute.</P>

<P>Mr Ashcroft's actions come at a time when there are deep differences between states over capital punishment. Last month, the outgoing governor of Illinois, Jim Ryan, commuted the sentences of all the states' death row inmates.</P>

<P>Mr Burr suggested there was also a racial tinge to the attorney general's interventions.</P>

 <P>He said: "In the cases he is seeking the death penalty overriding the prosecutors, 95% are cases involving people of color, so it appears to be racist. He seems to side with prosecutors who recommend not to seek the death penalty against white defendants, but when prosecutors want to drop the death penalty against black or Latino defendants, he overrides them."</P>

<P>In one case, a federal judge initially ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional, due to the growing number of death row inmates exonerated by DNA evidence. The ruling was overturned on appeal, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Diego Rodriguez and Alan Quinones, who were accused of killing a government informant.</P>

<P>In a controversial case, Mr Ashcroft demanded the death sentence for Jairo Zapata, who was charged with involvement in two gangland killings in New York. He had agreed to testify against other members of the Colombian gang in return for a signed agreement from prosecutors that they would not seek his execution.</P>

<P>Prosecutors have complained that the decision will make it difficult to secure the cooperation of defendants in organized crime cases.</P>

<P>Jim Walden, a former senior federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, said that it was "a remarkably bad decision" to impose a national death penalty policy against the judgment of local federal prosecutors, who were often seeking cooperating witnesses. "It will likely result in fewer murders being solved because fewer defendants will choose to cooperate," he told the New York Times.</p>
