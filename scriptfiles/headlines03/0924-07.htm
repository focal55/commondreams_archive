<p>Howard Dean, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has been built on an antiwar message,  yesterday questioned the antiwar credentials  of his newest opponent,  Gen. Wesley K. Clark.</p>
<P>
Dr. Dean, who  himself has been accused by rivals of flip-flopping on issues, focused on  remarks General Clark made last week when, in interviews, he first said that he  probably would have voted for the Congressional resolution authorizing war in Iraq and then, the following day, was led to backtrack.</p>
<P>
"I was shocked" by General Clark's initial comment on the resolution, Dr. Dean, former governor of Vermont,  said in an interview as he flew  from a rally in Boston to a series of fund-raisers in New York. "I was even more shocked that he switched the next day."</p>
<P>
"He still has to clarify his position," the candidate added.</p>
<P>
Dr. Dean, who had  met several times with General Clark to discuss national security, spoke after a week in which the retired NATO commander's  entry into the crowded race largely eclipsed the former governor's summer surge.</p>
<P>
Though raising questions about his new rival,  Dr. Dean largely  stuck yesterday to the tactics that had  attracted a great deal of support, intensifying his attack on President Bush.  He  drew laughs from a noontime crowd of about 3,000 at Copley Square in Boston when he said that before the American Revolution, "there was a king named George who had forgotten his own people in favor of special interests."</p>
<P>
"What's at stake in this election is democracy itself," he said. "James Madison and Thomas Jefferson spoke of the fear that economic power would one day seize political power. That fear has been realized in this administration."</p>
<P>
Dr. Dean used the language of the Constitution's preamble to condemn the president's  record on court appointments, race, education, domestic security and the war on terrorism.  "This democracy and the flag of the United States," he then said, "do not belong to Rush Limbaugh and Jerry Falwell and Tom DeLay and John Ashcroft and Dick Cheney."</p>
<P>
Though in the home state of a second Democratic rival, Senator John Kerry, he made no mention of him.</p>
<P>
The speech  followed suggestions by three national polls that after a week of saturation news coverage, General Clark had moved at least for now  to the top of the 10-member Democratic presidential field.</p>
<P>
For his part, the general focused yesterday on  Mr. Bush and Iraq.</p>
<P>
"I've been against the war from the beginning," he told reporters in Indiana, where he later addressed students at DePauw University.</p>
<P>
"I never saw the imminent threat in Iraq, and I think the president failed to really make the case of the imminent threat," he said. "I think the facts on the ground show there wasn't an imminent threat, and I think this is the whole undercurrent which has made it so difficult for him to receive the kind of assistance he and we would like to have from the international community."</p>
<P>
Then, in his visit to DePauw last night,  General Clark told students that the United States needed  "a new strategy for dealing with the world and a new strategy at home."  He also said his young campaign had already raised $1 million.</p>
<P>
If  General Clark's candidacy took the harsh spotlight off Dr. Dean last week, the onetime governor has  continued to be  a chief object of criticism by his Democratic rivals. Yesterday, aides to Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri circulated  a  newspaper article highlighting Dr. Dean's comment that a  "white male president can talk to whites about racism, and a white male president can talk to men about domestic violence better than a woman who is a victim."</p>
<P>
Tricia Enright, Dr. Dean's communications director, noted that he had made that remark  during a meeting of women's advocates, and said of the Edwards-Gephardt tactic,  "I don't know whether this is more offensive or pathetic."</p>
<P>
"He's saying, you know, race is a white person's problem, too, and domestic violence is a man's problem, too," she said. "What he's saying is you have a responsibility as president to use the bully pulpit to talk about these issues, as tough and difficult as they are."</p>
