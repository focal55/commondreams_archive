<p>BOSTON - Gays and lesbians will most likely be able to wed legally soon in Massachusetts following a landmark same-sex marriage ruling by the state's top court that experts said is airtight -- at least for now.

</table>Experts interviewed on Wednesday said there seemed to be little the state legislature or anyone else could do to short-circuit the Supreme Judicial Court's historic decision in the near-term, despite opponents' vows to the contrary.

<p>In a 4-3 ruling on Tuesday, the court said barring gays and lesbians from marrying violates the state constitution, but it stayed its ruling for six months -- ostensibly to let the legislature bring state laws into line with the decision.
<p>Some experts believed lawmakers would use that time to craft a civil union law similar to the one in Vermont, the only other state that legally recognizes same-sex couples.

<p>In Vermont, civil unions give couples many of the benefits of marriage under a different name. The statute's influence effectively ends at Vermont's borders, however, as it is not recognized by the federal government and many states.

<p>"Within 180 days the legislature will have to pass some kind of legislation which is civil union in nature, and if they fail to do so then presumably marriages would have to be offered to gay couples in that sense," Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said on ABC's "Good Morning America."

<p>LEGISLATURE MAY DO NOTHING

<p>But one key legislator -- Robert Travaglini, president of the Massachusetts Senate -- has already said the ruling does not explicitly force the legislature to act.

<p>"We're not sure why they gave us 180 days -- to do what?" said Travaglini spokeswoman Ann Dufresne. "It's our read that anything we send them (short of full marriage rights for gays and lesbians) is not good enough."

<p>If the legislature does nothing, the issue would likely go back to court as everyone from liberals to conservatives test the boundaries of the ruling, analysts said.

<p>Cambridge, a famously left-wing Massachusetts city, is already contemplating issuing marriage licenses to gays and lesbians before the 180-day waiting period expires.

<p>"Lawmakers don't have to do anything, but they could act to provide something. They could also flagrantly flaunt the court's decision or provide something less than marriage -- which would wind up right back in court," said Elizabeth Bartholet, who teaches family law at Harvard Law School.

<p>Experts also said the decision cannot be appealed to a higher court, meaning gay marriage foes would have to amend either the Massachusetts Constitution or the U.S. Constitution to circumvent the ruling.

<p>Romney, a Republican, says the state constitution should be changed to define marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman, and conservatives across the country are pushing for a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

<p>But legal scholars noted it is extremely difficult to change either document. In Massachusetts alone, it would take years to amend the state constitution.

<p>While the prospect of gay and lesbian weddings in the state appeared to take on an air of inevitability, foes of same-sex unions remained resolute.

<p>"There's never going to be homosexual marriage. This movement will be defeated," said Randall Terry, founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
