  </table></font>The protesters were escorted from a visitors gallery overlooking a hall where Rumsfeld was addressing a gathering of journalists on Iraq.
<p>&quot;Mr. Rumsfeld you're fired,&quot; a woman yelled as Rumsfeld was beginning a speech on Iraq and the war on terrorism that followed the attacks on the US Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon.
<p>&quot;Your foreign policy is based on lies. The war in Iraq is unjust and illegal and the occupation is immoral,&quot; she said.
<p>Shouts went up of &quot;Bring the troops home now!&quot; and &quot;Tell us when the troops are coming home. They need to come home.&quot;
<p>Protesters unfurled a banner from the gallery before being led away, chanting, &quot;Hey, Mr. Rumsfeld, what do you say? How many children did you kill today.&quot;
<p>Rumsfeld, watching from below, turned back to his audience and said: &quot;Well, now.&quot;
<p>&quot;You know I just came in from Baghdad, and there are now 100 newspapers in the free press in Iraq -- in the free Iraq -- where people are able to say whatever they wish, people are debating, people are discussing, something they had not done for decades,&quot; he said.
<p>Less than five months ago, the Iraqi regime was still filling mass graves with the bodies of men, women and children and executing people in its prisons, he said.
<p>&quot;It was still repressing thought and speech in that country,&quot; he said. &quot;And that has ended.&quot;
