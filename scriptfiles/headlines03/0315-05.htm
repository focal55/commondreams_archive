<p>MUNICH --  

German Development Minister Heidemarie Wielczorek-Zeul was on a high 

when she arrived at a TV studio recently for a panel discussion fresh from 

joining 600,000 protesters in Berlin marching against a U.S.-led war on Iraq.

<P>"I was immensely proud to take part in that great demonstration for peace," 

said Wielczorek-Zeul, a close associate of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder since 

the 1970s, when both were leaders of an anti-U.S. youth wing of the Social 

Democratic Party. "After all, the Americans don't care about democracy in the 

Middle East."

</table></font>But a sharp rebuke from one of the panelists suddenly caused her to fall 

silent.

<P>"Only last week Saddam Hussein had 13 people executed in Baghdad, but 

nobody here demonstrated," said Hussein al Mozani, a prominent Iraqi writer 

who lives in exile in Germany. "And nobody went on the street to express their 

horror at the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis over the 

years. Hussein can be removed only by war."

<P>Wielczorek-Zeul hasn't been the only Cabinet minister to be lectured by an 

Iraqi exile.

<P>When Family Minister Renate Schmidt, a Social Democrat from Bavaria, 

enthusiastically praised the Berlin marchers on another talk show for 

"standing up against a terrible, totally unjustifiable war," she was 

challenged by journalist Namo Azis.

<P>"All these demonstrations are not in the interest of the Iraqi people, who 

for years have been terrorized, raped, brutalized," he said.

<P>Looking at the flustered Schmidt, Azis added, "The German government is 

very short-sighted, and it's not surprising that Chancellor Schroeder and 

Foreign Minister (Joschka) Fischer have been cheered for their anti-war stance 

by Iraq's government-controlled press."

<P>But such sentiments are the exception these days in Germany, as anti-U.S. 

sentiment over the looming war with Iraq is increasingly coupled with a hatred 

of all things American.

<P>In September, Schroeder won a tough election only after pledging to oppose 

a war against Iraq. A recent survey by the Public Opinion Poll showed that 

only 15 percent of Germans and 8 percent of Austrians believed the American 

way of life was something to strive for. In the same poll, President Bush was 

rated as no more "likable" than Hussein.

<P>"It increasingly takes guts to be for the Americans" these days, said Heinz 

Graefer, a Munich sociologist.

<P>Although Germans who support Bush's position appear to be in the 

minority, there are some who say they understand it in view of the Sept. 11 

attacks.

<P>"The U.S. doesn't want to take any chances that there will be future 

attacks," said Manfred Hildmann, a 46-year-old accountant from the Bavarian 

town of Freilassing. "If you consider Saddam Hussein's dreadful actions in the 

past, it's plausible that he is working on weapons of mass destruction and 

willing to turn them over to terrorists."

<P>But for many Germans, America-bashing has become a favorite pastime.

<P>Entertainers appear to be the most outspoken critics, voicing not only 

fierce opposition to a war in Iraq, but singling out Bush. Last month, 19 

prominent German intellectuals signed a declaration strongly supporting 

Schroeder's anti-war position, including Nobel Prize laureate Gunter Grass and 

playwright Martin Walser.

<P>The major conduits for anti-U.S. sentiment are the ubiquitous television 

talk shows.

<P>"Iraq would be of no interest to the U.S. if it didn't have oil," said 

Senta Berger, the Austrian-born actress who spent several years in Hollywood 

during the 1960s. On ZDF TV, she likened the impending war with Iraq to the 

Nazis' attempt to secure oil fields in the Caspian region by laying siege to 

Stalingrad in 1943.

<P>On another program, popular TV actor Uwe Friedrichsen said: "When Hitler 

invaded Poland in 1939, he faked a Polish military attack on a German border 

town as a pretext. But in the case of Iraq, the Americans don't even bother to 

fabricate such excuses."

<P>Prominent playwright Peter Handke, whose plays are mainstays on the German 

stage, said the United States should be disarmed, not Iraq. "That would be the 

solution to the current problem, because it's the Americans who have the most 

atrocious weapons," he said.

<P>In the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine, Alice Schwarzer, a noted 

feminist author, said: "The world superpower USA no longer seems accustomed to 

anyone contradicting its views, not even on issues about life and death, the 

death of others."

<P>A regular on the America-bashing circuit is Konstantin Wecker, a 55-year-

old singer-songwriter who is a household name in Germany. Wecker recently 

returned from a highly publicized "peace trip" to Baghdad that his critics 

called a publicity stunt.

<P>"In the event of war with Iraq, the German government should close down all 

overflights of U.S. military planes," Wecker told a Munich newspaper.

<P>Leaders of the leftist peace movement that organized huge protests against 

U.S. troops deployed in West Germany in the 1980s are back in action as well. 

One is Eugen Drewermann, a 62-year-old theologian, who recently said on ARD TV:

<P>"If Bush wants to fight evil, he should start on his own psyche."

<P>Expressing pity for the "poor people held as prisoners by the Americans 

at Guantanamo," Drewermann held the United States responsible for starting the 

Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and lavished praise on Dustin Hoffman and other U.S.

<P>actors "for publicly standing up against Bush and his war plans" at the 

recent Berlin film festival.

<P>The surge of anti-Americanism is particularly striking in view of the huge 

debt Germany owes the United States for providing generous help in the post-

war reconstruction era, security during the Cold War and decisive assistance 

in gaining unification more than a decade ago.

<P>"Anti-American sentiment no longer is the traditional preoccupation of 

either leftist or rightist newspaper feature editors," said Michael Stuermer, 

a leading editorial writer at the conservative Die Welt. "It unstoppably is 

becoming a sort of matter-of-course mood for the whole country."

<P>A patron in his 30s at a Munich beer hall put it more bluntly: "We are 

all fed up with Americans looking down at us for the Holocaust -- something 

that our generation had nothing to do with," he said. "Now, the Americans are 

all set to start their own holocaust in Iraq."

<P>Feeling free of any guilt for the Nazi crimes, many of Germany's younger 

generation are taking another look at World War II, with some even regarding 

the Germans as victims of the conflict.

<P>Historian Joerg Friedrich recently shattered a taboo by writing a best-

selling book "The Fire -- Germany and the Bombardment 1940-1945" about the 

destruction of German cities by U.S. and British bombers. The book, which 

condemns the attacks as war crimes and indirectly suggests that they may be 

comparable to the Holocaust, inspired a recent series on German TV.</p>
