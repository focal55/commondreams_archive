<p>TERRE HAUTE, Ind.  - A Gulf War veteran whose plea  for clemency claimed exposure to Iraqi nerve gas made him  violent was executed by the U.S. government on Tuesday for the  1995 rape and murder of a young servicewoman.

</table></font>Louis Jones, Jr., 53, became the third federal death row  convict to be put to death since the government resumed  executions in June 2001 with those of fellow Gulf War veteran  and convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and drug  kingpin Juan Garza eight days later.<p>



		Jones died at 7:08 a.m. EST after an injection of lethal  chemicals at the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana,  site of the only federal execution chamber. His final meal the  evening before consisted of peaches, nectarines and plums.<p>



		"Though the Lord has chastised me forth he hath not given  me over unto death," Jones said as the drugs were injected. He  then began singing a hymn beginning "Jesus keep me near the  cross..." before drifting off.<p>



		He was the 17th person put to death in the United States so  far this year, at a time of renewed debate in the country on  the death penalty and continuing international criticism. The  governor of Illinois earlier this year emptied that state's  death row, citing injustices in the law.<p>



		Jones appealed to President Bush to commute his sentence to  life in prison, based on disclosures since his 1995 trial about  allied exposure to nerve gas during the 1991 conflict and  ailments collectively known as Gulf War Syndrome.<p>



		A decorated former member of the U.S. Special Forces who  had retired from the military, Jones confessed to breaking into  Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, ostensibly to  look for his estranged wife, and abducting Air Force Pvt.  Tracie McBride instead. He admitted raping the 19-year-old  McBride in his apartment, then taking her to a bridge where he  beat her to death with a tire iron.<p>



		ARGUED WAS EXPOSED TO GAS<p>



		He was tried in under the 1988 law that reinstated federal  executions because McBride was kidnapped from a U.S. military  base.<p>



		Texas Tech University law professor Timothy Floyd, who  handled Jones' appeals, argued the jury did not get to hear  about subsequent Pentagon revelations that Jones was among more  than 100,000 allied soldiers exposed to Sarin nerve gas while  chasing retreating Iraqi troops.<p>



		Prosecutors argued Jones had shown violent tendencies  before the Gulf War, citing beatings he administered to a few  fellow soldiers.<p>



		At his trial, defense lawyers argued Jones did not have a  criminal record prior to McBride's murder, but had suffered  abuse as a child and post-traumatic stress disorder from his  wartime duties. He parachuted under fire into Grenada during  the 1983 U.S. invasion of the Caribbean island and was among  front-line troops that drove into Iraq in the Gulf War.<p>



		The United States is the only western democracy in which  the death penalty is still used. According to Amnesty  International, in 2001 China carried out the most executions,  2,468, followed by Iran, 138, Saudi Arabia 79 and the United  States 66.
