<p>SAN FRANCISCO - Does movie star Arnold  Schwarzenegger have a problem with women?
<P>
Although Schwarzenegger's run for governor of California  has excited many voters tired of conventional politicians such  Gov. Gray Davis, some are complaining the actor's past  statements and behavior toward women cast doubts about his  character.<P>
In the latest distraction from Schwarzenegger's official  message of a "people's revolution" to retake Sacramento in an  Oct. 7 recall vote, a group of women announced they would  picket the former bodybuilder's campaign headquarters on Friday  to protest what they call his misogynist views and crude  behavior toward women.<P>
"I am not concerned about what he does that is consensual,"  said Karen Pomer, the founder of the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0817-01.htm">Rainbow Sisters Project</a>, a  group of rape victims. "But women who do not want to be touched  who he touches -- the reports of him harassing women -- they  are of great concern.
<P>
"It's degrading to women."<P>
Schwarzenegger is married to television journalist Maria  Shriver, a member of the nation's most prominent Democratic  family as niece of the late President John F. Kennedy. They  have four children.<P>
Some published articles have portrayed Schwarzenegger as  touching women's bottoms and breasts without their consent.<P>
In a recent interview with Reuters, his best friend Franco  Columbu confirmed that such incidents have taken place, such as  when he touched the breasts of a British television presenter.<P>
"Like the girl in London when he was lying on the bed, the  couch or whatever it was, and touching her and taking a  picture," Columbu said. "That stuff is Arnold, he does that. He  says, 'You have nice big legs' and touch her, fine. But nothing  harmful or telling somebody 'Leave, I am going to be with her  alone."'<P>
"They love it of course. I've never seen him do something  that was, like, out of place. Talking, yes, he would say  something like 'Oh, you look so sexy,' 'Oh, ya, you have a nice  ass,' but that's it."<P>

  </table></font>TRUE LIES?<P>
Schwarzenegger has raised eyebrows in recent days with the  recirculation of a 1977 interview in which he discusses  participating in group sex. He initially dodged questions on  the topic, then on Wednesday he said he had made up the story.<P>
"The '70s was a totally different era," he told MSNBC. "We  tried to promote 'Pumping Iron,' so you say outrageous things  to make headlines in the newspaper."<P>
Over his long career in bodybuilding and then film,  Schwarzenegger has often discussed women and sex in a way that  some voters may find objectionable.<P>
"Girls became sex objects. I saw the other bodybuilders  using them in this way and I thought it was all right," he  wrote in his 1977 memoir "Arnold: The Education of a  Bodybuilder."<P>
"Whatever I thought might hold me back, I avoided. I  crossed girls off my list -- except as tools for my sexual  needs."<P>
"My attitude about all that has changed radically. I used  to feel that women were here for one reason. Sex was simply  another kind of exercise, another body function."<P>
In the 1974 book "Pumping Iron" Schwarzenegger said: "If I  see a girl with big tits, I'm going to stare and stare. And I'm  going to think in my mind what I am going to do with her if I  would have her."<P>
Asked for comment on Thursday, Schwarzenegger's campaign  arranged a telephone interview with Bonnie Reiss, a family  friend who is CEO of the actor's Inner-City Games Foundation.<P>
"In 24 years of friendship and in 10 years of working on  his children's foundation with him, never, ever, ever has he  treated me or any other woman I have ever seen when I am in his  presence with anything but respect and regard," he said. "Is  that a misogynist? I think it is the opposite."
