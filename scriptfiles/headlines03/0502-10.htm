<p>UNITED NATIONS - Two American women angered by the U.S. decision to stop funding the U.N. population agency said Thursday their grassroots campaign has so far raised $1 million for the agency, money that will go to helping women in poor nations.

<p>More than 100,000 people - the vast majority Americans - have contributed to their campaign, which began in October, after President Bush blocked $34 million for the U.N. Population Fund last year, accusing the agency of tolerating abortions and forced sterilizations in China.

<p>Now media mogul Ted Turner is giving a boost. The United Nations Foundation - which he created to manage his $1 billion gift to the world body - announced it would match the campaign's donations with 25 cents to the dollar, for a total of $250,000.

<p>Jane Roberts, a retired teacher from California, and Lois Abraham, a lawyer from New Mexico, are still a long way from their goal of raising the $34 million that was withheld.

<p>But 200 letters with contributions arrive every day, and they are taking their campaign worldwide, staring in Europe on May 7.

<p>Thoraya Obaid, executive director of the U.N. Population Fund known as UNFPA, said the funding halt forced the agency to call off new programs and the expansion of existing ones.

<p>Half the $1 million raised will be used in six African nations to tackle a condition called fistula that damages the bladder and urinary tract in pregnant women and often leads to severe infection, and sometimes death.

<p>Other funds will go to programs providing contraceptive information in Mongolia, training health workers in Eritrea, tackling HIV/AIDS in Rwanda and high teenage pregnancy in Bhutan, and helping midwives in East Timor.

<p>"The outpouring of support from ordinary American citizens for UNFPA ... shows that the American people support the right of women in all countries to have quality health care and to be able to plan their families," Obaid said.

<p>Congress appropriated $34 million last year for the U.N. agency, but conservative activists opposed the funding on grounds that U.N. money was being used for forced abortions and sterilizations in China.

<p>A U.S. government fact-finding team found no evidence that the U.N. fund had "knowingly supported or participated in" such policies in China. Still, Bush refused to release the money.

<p>Roberts - of Redlands, Calif. - and Abraham - who now divides her time between Taos, N.M., San Francisco and Australia - were both enraged, though they didn't yet know each other. Each began e-mailing friends and others trying to drum up $1 donations.

<p>UNFPA introduced the two, and in October they launched "34 Million Friends of UNFPA."
