<p> An award-winning documentary about the coup last year that briefly ousted the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, has become the subject of a bitter dispute. Last week, it was withdrawn from an Amnesty International (AI) film festival because Amnesty staff in Caracas said they feared for their safety if it were shown. 

<p>The film, <a href="http://www.chavezthefilm.com/index_ex.htm" target="_new">The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</a>, was made by two Irish film makers, Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. They were preparing a documentary about Mr Chavez, with his cooperation, before the coup and were inside the presidential palace in April 2002 when the events unfolded. 

<p>The film has since been shown on television by the BBC, by RTE in Ireland, and elsewhere in Europe. This week it won two prizes at the Grierson documentary awards in Britain. 

<p>Mr Chavez was briefly removed from office by a military coup but returned to power after 48 hours. The political situation was then, and remains, highly polarized. The president as portrayed by his opponents is a dangerous, anti-US communist, while Chavez supporters see the opposition as the privileged seeking to preserve their powers from the underprivileged. 

<p>The film portrays Mr Chavez in a sympathetic light. It was shown on the public television channel in Venezuela earlier this year. The private television channels are all opposed to Mr Chavez. 

<p>Last week, the film was due to be shown at the AI film festival in Vancouver. The organizing committee came under pressure from Chavez opponents in Venezuela and eventually decided not to show it. 

<p>John Tackaberry of AI said yesterday that the decision had been taken only after Amnesty staff in Venezuela had said that, if it were shown, it would present "some degree of threat to their physical safety". 

<p>They told colleagues that, even if Amnesty ran a standard disclaimer, the organization would be associated with the film, thus endangering its staff. 

<p>Mr Tackaberry said the withdrawal was not to do with the film's quality or its politics, as Amnesty did not endorse any of the films at its festivals. 

<p>Other festivals due to show the film, and broadcasters who plan to show it, have been urged not to do so, or to allow a right to reply. 

<p>A Venezuelan TV producer and engineer, Wolfgang Schalk, is leading the campaign against the film. He said yesterday, in an email, that the film presented a distorted version of events. Mr Schalk said he had spent five months investigating the film. 

<p>"It tells a nice story with 'true' images of a 'coup' from the inside. But my 24 years of experience with TV, and a lifetime of living in Venezuela, told me something was wrong." He assembled a forum with a general, a news executive of a private television station and the chief of police to analyze it, he said. 

<p>He claimed it became clear that the producers had "changed the order of the events to fit a story that appeals to audiences." 

<p>An online petition was organized to complain about the film, which Mr Schalk said did not meet the ethical standards of the BBC. 

<p>The film makers are angry that attempts are being made to stop the film from being shown and defend its accuracy. "Our film presents a perspective on the events of April 2002 which is different to the one presented by the privately owned media in Venezuela," they said in a statement. 

<p>"Unfortunately, this perfectly legitimate decision by AI to protect the safety of their workers has been distorted by some in order to claim that AI dropped our documentary because of its content."
