Threats by Republicans to cut the General
                        Accounting Office (GAO) budget influenced its decision
                        to abandon a lawsuit against Vice President Dick Cheney,
                        The Hill has learned.</p>
                      <p>Sources familiar with
                          high-level discussions at the GAO said Sen. Ted Stevens
                          (R-Alaska), chairman
                        of the Appropriations Committee, met with GAO Comptroller
                        General David Walker earlier this year and &#8220;unambiguously&#8221; pressured
                        him to drop the suit or face cuts in his $440 million
                      budget.</p>
                      <p>Walker yesterday acknowledged meeting Stevens,
                        but denied the senator threatened to cut funding for
                        the investigative agency. However, he confirmed that
                        such threats were made, although he said they came from
                        a lawmaker not &#8220;in a position to deliver&#8221; on
                      them and did not occur recently. </p>
         
                      <p>The decision to drop the lawsuit has raised
                          concerns that Congress&#8217;s all-purpose auditor
                          has sacrificed its traditional role as an independent
                        arm of Congress.</p>
                      <p>&#8220;
                          I met with Stevens in his capacity of president pro
                            tempore,&#8221; the
                          comptroller said: &#8220;In the conversation with Sen.
                          Stevens there was no assertion or inference [of funding
                        cuts]. He didn&#8217;t even raise the issue of appropriations.&#8221; </p>
                      <p>Walker
                          did say, however, that several lawmakers have threatened
                          in the past year to cut agency funding if
                          it persisted with the controversial lawsuit. He also
                          said the budget threat was among a number of factors
                          that tipped his Feb. 7 decision to halt litigation.                        </p>
                      <p>A GAO staff member and several Stevens&#8217;s
                        aides attended the meeting.</p>
                      <p>Stevens&#8217;s offices were
                          closed at press time and neither the senator nor his
                          spokeswoman could be reached
                        for comment.</p>
                      <p>The controversy with Cheney came to a
                          head in December after U.S. District Court Judge John
                          Bates, citing
                              separation of powers, ruled that Walker lacked
                        sufficient grounds
                              to compel Cheney to disclose the records of a White
                        House energy task force that he had headed. </p>
                      <p>Walker
                          had filed the suit against Cheney in February 2002
                        at the request of House Democrats. This was
                                the first time in its 81-year history that the
                                GAO, acting
                                in its capacity as the investigative arm of Congress,
                                sued the executive branch to obtain withheld
                        information.</p>
                      <p>Walker said he initiated all the meetings
                          on Capitol Hill and &#8220;I did what I thought was
                        right.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>Before deciding not to appeal Bates&#8217;s
                          decision, Walker said he met senior Republicans and
                          Democrats in
                                  both chambers, and most lawmakers of them urged
                          him not to pursue the matter. He said, &#8220;I considered
                          all the facts and circumstances and am very comfortable
                          with
                        my decision.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>But several House Democratic
                                  leaders and key members of the Democratic Caucus
                                  have stringently
                                  criticized
                        Walker&#8217;s decision.</p>
                      <p>&#8220;
                          I thought it was a bad decision,&#8221; said Rep. Henry
                                  Waxman (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Government
                                  Reform Committee, who along with Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
                                  the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee,
                        pressed Walker to file the suit last year.</p>
                      <p>&#8220;
                          If you have a GOP Congress not interested in exercising
                                  the role of oversight, and GAO doesn&#8217;t
                                  act independently of the Congress, there is
                                  nobody providing the job of
                                  checks and balances called for in our Constitution,&#8221; said
                                  Waxman. &#8220;This jeopardizes GAO&#8217;s
                        ability to act independently in the future.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>Bates,
                                  who was nominated to the bench by the current
                                  president, ruled against the GAO because &#8220;neither
                                  a house of Congress nor any congressional committee
                        has issued a subpoena for the disputed information.&#8221; </p>
                      <p>By
                                  not appealing this ruling, House Democrats
                                  argue, GAO will not be able to pursue sensitive
                                  information
                                  in the future without permission from the majority
                        party.</p>
                      <p>House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.)
                          said Walker&#8217;s
                                    decision was a &#8220;very unfortunate undermining
                        of GAO&#8217;s independence and effectiveness.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>Rep.
                                    Bob Matsui (D-Calif.), chair of the House
                                    Democrats&#8217; campaign
                                    committee, said, &#8220;This not only undermines
                                    the independence of the GAO, but it also
                                    makes it difficult
                        to get information.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>&#8220;
                          With the congressional committees controlled by the
                            Republicans, I think it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll
                            see GAO pursue something adversarial, and that&#8217;s
                            a problem,&#8221; Matsui
                                    added. Matsui said he believed that Walker
                            probably faced political pressure to drop the lawsuit.                        </p>
                      <p>On the floor of the House last Wednesday,
                        Waxman condemned Walker&#8217;s decision.</p>
                      <p>&#8220;GAO will be able to continue [its]
                        routine work. And if a Republican controlled committee
                        ever urges GAO to
                                    pursue a controversial investigation of the
                        Bush administration, GAO may be able to do this. But
                        don&#8217;t hold your
                        breath.&#8221;</p>
                      
<p>Walker said that while Republican control of Congress and the White House makes 
GAO investigations more complicated, it wouldn&#8217;t affect his judgment. If 
the GAO is unable to obtain information from the executive branch, Walker said 
he would ask the appropriate committee of jurisdiction for a subpoena.</p>
                      <p>In response to allegations that the agency&#8217;s
                        effectiveness would be diminished, Walker pointed to
                        GAO&#8217;s
                                    annual report, which shows that the agency
                                    saved taxpayers $37.7
                                    billion in return for its approximately $440
                        million budget. </p>
                      <p>Walker, a former aide to
                          President Reagan who took office in November 1998,
                        is serving
                                      a
                      15-year term. </p>
