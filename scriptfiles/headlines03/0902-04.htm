 </font>Robbins, in Venice to present the world premiere of his latest film &quot;Code 42,&quot; said his vehement opposition to the war earlier this year had not damaged his Hollywood career.

<p>
 &quot;I think the recent controversy was a gift. It provided an opportunity to speak out about free speech,&quot; said Robbins, who added that others in Hollywood and across the United States had wanted to publicly oppose the war -- but chose not to.

<p>
 &quot;Freedom of speech starts with you opening your mouth and people often abdicate that freedom in their mind.

<p>
 &quot;They choose not to speak. Once you choose not to speak, you might as well not have it,&quot; he said.

<p>
 But Robbins -- star of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and this year's &quot;Mystic River,&quot; directed by Clint Eastwood -- admitted the build-up to the war had unnerved him.

<p>
 &quot;For the first time in my life, I got a bodyguard,&quot; he said, referring to the shooting in the Middle East and China of &quot;Code 42,&quot; a film by British director Michael Winterbottom.

<p>
 &quot;But my anxiety had no basis in reality and people were very adult about what was going on, making the distinction between American people and their government,&quot; he said.

<p>
 Winterbottom's futuristic British entry for the Golden Lion prize at the Venice film festival was shot in Shanghai in China; Dubai, capital of the United Arab Emirates; and Jaipur in India.

<p>
 Set in the near future and co-starring Samantha Morton, it combines a love story, a thriller and an exploration of the consequences of human cloning.

<p>
 Robbins plays an insurance investigator probing the distribution of false &quot;papellas&quot; or visas, which are being passed to restricted non-citizens who populate the desert areas on the fringes of the cities.

<p>
 On the way, he begins a doomed relationship with the suspect, Maria, brilliantly played by Morton.

<p>
 Winterbottom said the film's examination of alienation has many parallels his last film &quot;In This World.&quot; The tale of two Afghan men on an epic journey from a refugee camp in Pakistan to London won a Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival.

<p>
 &quot;Code 42&quot; is one of two British entries for the Golden Lion prize.
