<p>BAGHDAD  - 

Immediate popular reaction in Baghdad

on Saturday to the loss of the U.S. space shuttle Columbia and

its seven-member crew -- including the first Israeli in space

-- was that it was God's retribution.

<p>

 "We are happy that it broke up," government employee Abdul

Jabbar al-Quraishi said.

<p>

 "God wants to show that his might is greater than the

Americans. They have encroached on our country. God is avenging

us," he said.

<p>

 Iraqis are braced for a possible U.S.-led war to rid their

country of any chemical, biological or nuclear weapons it may

possess. Iraq denies it has such weapons.

<p>

 Car mechanic Mohammed Jaber al-Tamini noted Israeli air

force Colonel Ilan Ramon was among the dead when the shuttle

broke up over the southwestern United States 16 minutes before

its scheduled landing.

<p>

 The 48-year-old Israeli astronaut was a fighter pilot in

the Israeli air force. He was the youngest pilot in a team that

bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. Israel said the reactor

was intended to develop nuclear weapons.

<p>

 "Israel launched an aggression on us when it raided our

nuclear reactor without any reason, now time has come and God

has retaliated to their aggression," Tamini said.

<p>

 There were no such signs of jubilation over the shuttle

disaster in any of the Palestinian territories. The official

response from the Palestinians was one of condolence.

<p>

"President (Yasser) Arafat and the Palestinian Authority offer their condolences to the six American families and the

Israeli family who lost their loved ones in the catastrophe,"

Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official and spokesman, told

Reuters.

<p>

 Erekat said Arafat had sent President Bush  a message of

condolences over the loss of the NASA  space agency's shuttle.

The United States, Israel's closest ally, is the chief Middle

East peace broker.</p>
