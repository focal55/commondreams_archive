<p>MADISON, Wisconsin  - February 5 - The American Civil Liberties Union today urged a Wisconsin court to 
affirm a lower court decision upholding the state&#8217;s discipline of a pharmacist 
who refused to refill a prescription for birth control pills without ensuring 
that the patient would be able to get her medication.&nbsp;
<P>&#8220;We are hopeful that the court will agree that individual pharmacists with 
religious objections should not be able to prevent women from accessing 
contraception,&#8221; said Sondra Goldschein, an attorney with the ACLU Reproductive 
Freedom Project.&nbsp; &#8220;Pharmacies should honor individual pharmacists&#8217; 
religious beliefs wherever possible; however, the patient&#8217;s right to obtain 
legally prescribed medication should always come first.&#8221;</P>
<P>In 2002, Neil Noesen, a devout Roman Catholic pharmacist who has a religious 
objection to the use of contraceptives, refused to refill a woman&#8217;s valid 
prescription for birth control pills.&nbsp; Noesen went on to impede the woman&#8217;s 
efforts to fill the prescription at another pharmacy.&nbsp; As a result, the 
woman missed the first dose of her medication and was forced to use a back-up 
method of contraception.&nbsp; The state Department of Regulation and Licensing 
Pharmacy Examining Board subsequently took disciplinary action against Noesen 
for his failure to adequately inform his employer of his religious objections to 
participating in the filling of prescriptions for contraception and for his 
refusal to promptly transfer this prescription to another pharmacy.</P>
<P>&#8220;Although the Wisconsin Constitution protects individuals from government 
interference with their practice of religion, it does not confer an absolute 
right to disregard the rights or welfare of others,&#8221; said Laurence Dupuis, Legal 
Director of the ACLU of Wisconsin.&nbsp; &#8220;Because women are the sole users of 
birth control pills, refusals to fill these valid prescriptions are tantamount 
to sex discrimination.&#8221;</P>
<P>A lower court ruled in February 2006 that the Department&#8217;s discipline of 
Noesen for departing from a pharmacist&#8217;s standard of care was constitutionally 
permissible.&nbsp; The Department held that a pharmacist &#8220;who exercises a 
conscientious objection to the dispensing of a prescription must ensure that 
there is an alternative mechanism for the patient to receive his or her 
medication.&#8221;&nbsp; Accordingly, the Department held, a pharmacist has a duty to 
fully inform employers of his or her limitations on practice arising out of his 
or her religious beliefs.&nbsp; This standard for accommodating religious 
objections and protecting patients&#8217; rights protects the public health, enhances 
patient autonomy, and promotes the equality of women.</P>
<P>Today&#8217;s case is Noesen v. Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing 
Pharmacy Examining Board.&nbsp; Lawyers on the friend-of-the-court brief include 
Goldschein of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, Dupuis of the ACLU of 
Wisconsin, and Milwaukee attorney Jacqueline E. Boyton.<!-- #EndEditable -->
