<p>NEW YORK - September  5- As Hurricane Felix made landfall on Tuesday, pounding the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua, the impact of this category five storm reveals the situation of at-risk communities marginalized through discrimination and government neglect.  As winds reached speeds of 160 miles per hour, wooden homes in Indigenous Miskito communities have been destroyed, leaving people exposed to the torrential rains.  Thousand have fled to higher ground, but have no access to emergency shelter.

<P></P>MADRE today emphasized that this hurricane and its ruinous effect on local communities are characteristic of a larger, disturbing trend.  To date, the majority of such disasters worldwide have struck low-income countries, with women making up a disproportionate number of the poor and of affected communities.  MADRE warned that climate change threatens to exacerbate this unjust situation: many scientists contend that hurricanes are increasing in force as sea temperatures rise; meanwhile, poor communities continue to be denied the tools for survival and recovery.

<P></P>Vivian Stromberg, Executive Director of MADRE, said today, "The Miskito communities in the path of this hurricane have long been below the radar of the national government and will be further isolated by the damages of this storm. Reports have already begun to emerge of people killed by this storm, and there is no time to waste in the emergency response.  Women's community based organizations, which have served these communities for years, are best-suited with the knowledge and ability to reach isolated communities and deliver aid where it is needed most.  MADRE has already begun an effort to provide immediate support."

<P></P>MADRE's partner organizations in Nicaragua have been severely damaged by Hurricane Felix.  Casa Museo, a community center and museum to preserve and exhibit the work of Indigenous artists, has seen the bulk of its displays destroyed by flooding. 

<P></P>In 1998, these same communities were devastated by Hurricane Mitch, in which flooding and landslides killed more than 10,000 people.  In the coming days, the danger of flash floods and mudslides will persist, and Hurricane Felix is expected to continue inland towards Guatemala.

<P></P>MADRE today stressed the essential role of women in recovery efforts.  Women are often the primary care-takers for children, the elderly and the disabled, and are best able to determine the needs of survivors.  Furthermore, MADRE emphasized that, as international relief efforts begin, priority must be given to equipping local community based organizations with the resources they need to respond effectively.

<P></P>MADRE is in close communication with women leaders from Indigenous communities impacted by Hurricane Felix and has launched an emergency aid campaign through MADRE's Emergency and Disaster Relief Fund.
