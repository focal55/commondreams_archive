<p>WASHINGTON - September 4 - Peace activists from around the country spent their Labor Day weekend
traveling to DC to "welcome back" Congress this week. With a Bush
Administration request for even more war money looming in the coming
weeks and Congressional approval at an all-time low, the peace majority
in this country is looking to WHIP CONGRESS INTO SHAPE. &nbsp;
    
    
    
    <br>
    <br>
This week will be choc full of creative, visual exhibitions aimed at
"whipping" the Democratic leadership to end the US military occupation
of Iraq. Great photo opps. CODEPINK will also be releasing a new flash
video called Whipping Congress into Shape, where CODEPINK jockeys ride Cong. Pelosi and Senator Reid to the “End the Occupation” finish line.

"The people are angry and want Congress to stand up to George Bush.
We’re here to herd them in the right direction: Set a fixed timeline
for withdrawal or stipulate that funds only be used for the safe and
speedy withdrawal of our troops," says CODEPINK cofounder Medea
Benjamin."

    <br> CODEPINK women and men from around the country will
continue their political pilgrimage to Congressional hearings, member
offices and hallways to demand an end to the illegal US military
occupation of Iraq. CODEPINK activists will be on Capitol Hill to hold
elected officials accountable for not representing the will of the
majority of Americans. CODEPINK now rents a 5 bedroom house blocks from
the Capitol and will continue its presence in Congress until the
Congress leads the US out of Iraq.
