<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 13 -  In a meeting today with the office of the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the American Civil Liberties Union 
rebuffed attempts to "modernize" the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
(FISA). The ACLU and other privacy groups and academics met with the DNI at the 
invitation of the DNI to discuss the broad changes that the Bush Administration 
and Department of Justice are seeking to make to FISA. </p>
<p>"Congress enacted FISA with the intention of protecting Americans from the 
very sort of domestic wiretapping the administration has engaged in," said 
Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. 
"Amending FISA after the fact would only serve to legitimize and reward the 
president's illegal actions. There is no legitimate need to expand FISA and the 
argument that this law cannot keep up with technology is flatly false. "</p>
<p>Though the ACLU and other groups met with intelligence officials in good 
faith, the organization remains skeptical of any attempt to expand or condone 
warrantless wiretapping within the United States. Congress originally passed 
FISA to provide the exclusive authority for the wiretapping of American citizens 
for foreign intelligence purposes. While the administration claims that its 
proposed FISA changes would "modernize" the law, in truth they would gut the 
judicial oversight mechanisms carefully crafted to prevent abuse, while 
expanding the scope of communications that can be intercepted under FISA. </p>

<p>The ACLU noted that, despite many recent hearings about "modernization" and 
"technology neutrality," the administration has not publicly provided Congress 
with a single example of how current FISA standards have either prevented the 
intelligence community from using new technologies, or proven unworkable for the 
agents tasked with following them. </p>
<p>"When it comes to the extent of the president's warrantless wiretapping 
program, the public is still in very much in the dark," said Fredrickson. "It's 
foolish to amend FISA before we fully understand the extent to which it was 
ignored. Congress still does not have all of the facts of the president's 
domestic spying. Lawmakers must continue to fight for answers and, while we 
wait, we simply cannot trust those who break the rules to make the 
rules."</p>
