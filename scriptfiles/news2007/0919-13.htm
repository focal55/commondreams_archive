<p>WASHINGTON - September 19 - The American Civil Liberties Union 
applauds today’s Senate vote of&nbsp;56 to&nbsp;43 on a procedural motion related to an 
amendment to the defense authorization bill that would restore habeas corpus 
rights. It is now clear that with a majority of senators voting for the 
amendment, habeas restoration is not only needed, but also desired by the 
Senate. <em>To restore Habeas Corpus for those detained by the United States</em> 

(S.AMDT. 2022), offered by Senators Specter (R-PA), Leahy (D-VT) and 
Dodd (D-CT), would restore the constitutional due process right of habeas corpus 
that was stripped away by the Military Commissions Act of 2006 
(MCA).</p>
<p>“Today’s vote was a 
victory for those seeking to restore both the rule of law and our nation’s 
Constitution,” said Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington 
Legislative Office. “The Military Commissions Act of 2006 stripped away one of 
our most fundamental rights - to challenge your imprisonment by the government. 
While the amendment ultimately was not filibuster proof, a majority of senators 
have made it clear that they want to restore the right of habeas corpus. The 
ACLU has worked diligently, leading a coalition of support for the restoration 
of habeas corpus. That tireless work is beginning to pay off and will be 
vindicated once habeas is signed back into law.”</p>
<p>The MCA stripped the 
constitutional right to habeas corpus from persons the president alone 
designates as enemy combatants. It allows our government to continue to hold 
hundreds of prisoners indefinitely at places like Guantanamo Bay, without ever charging them or giving 
them their day in court. The MCA was pushed through Congress just weeks ahead of 
the midterm elections in 2006.</p>
<p>Senators were voting to 
cut off debate to allow a vote on attaching the amendment to the fiscal 2008 
defense measure, H.R. 1585, which authorizes funding for the Department of 
Defense for the upcoming year. Unfortunately, this procedural move by 
Republicans required 60 votes to attach an amendment, which means that habeas 
restoration did not make it into the defense measure at this point. However, 
this ploy cannot take away from the fact that a majority of senators feel habeas 
corpus and the rule of law should be returned to the American 
people.</p>
<p>“Senators Specter, Leahy 
and Dodd should be commended for their efforts to restore our Constitution. 
Almost a year ago, the Senate voted to strip habeas corpus protections from 
hundreds of people, but today a majority of senators voted for bringing back 
American values,” said Christopher Anders, legislative counsel for the ACLU. 
“Because of procedural hijinks by Bush’s allies, the habeas fix will not get in 
the bill at this time.&nbsp; But the 
majority vote gives a green light to future conferees that the Senate supports 
putting a habeas fix in legislation being sent to the president.”</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
