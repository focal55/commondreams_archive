<p>LOS ANGELES - November 15 - Environmental activists will convert a traditional gasoline-electric hybrid to a 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) outside the L.A. Convention Center today. Sponsored by the Freedom From Oil Campaign and performed by the engineers of CalCars.org, the conversion will show that the auto industry could easily meet and surpass standards set by California's Clean Cars Law, which mandates a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2016.
<p></p>
Rather than adopt existing technologies that would improve overall fuel economy and reduce global warming pollution from tailpipes, automakers are fighting laws passed by California and 11 other states that would require stricter emission standards. The Freedom From Oil Campaign has repeatedly blasted carmakers for publicly touting their eco-credentials at the auto show while fighting progress on fuel efficiency and emissions in the courts.
<p></p>
According to Nick Magel of Global Exchange, "The 20 million people who will be buying new cars this year deserve the choice of affordable, union-made cars that don't guzzle gas and pollute. It is time the auto industry stop saying what they can't do, and join the government officials, business people, and concerned citizens who have shifted into high gear to reduce our dependence on oil and curb greenhouse gas emissions."
<p></p>
Plug-in hybrids are one of several options available to automakers to improve their environmental footprint: "Mass production of plug-in hybrids is not only possible, it is inevitable, but the auto industry needs to stop fighting progress and instead be willing to embrace it," said Sarah Connolly of Rainforest Action Network. "As we're showing today, plug-in technology is a way forward, but carmakers could make significant and immediate gains in fuel efficiency by using existing technologies to improve conventional gasoline vehicles."
<p></p>
Plug-in hybrids add battery power and a plug to a conventional hybrid while retaining a flexible fuel gas tank, which allows for all-electric, zero-emissions driving locally, and the ability to shift to gas for longer distances. Though plug-ins currently cost more because of the cost of batteries, battery technology is improving daily, and mass production of the vehicles by car companies will dramatically reduce prices.
<p></p>
"Grassroots engineers can do pretty good conversions, but we won't all win until carmakers do the job right," said Felix Kramer, founder of CalCars.org. "By mass-producing plug-in hybrids, the auto industry will make them affordable. And they could start now, with 'good enough' batteries in the first thousands of cars, knowing that by the time they've refined the product and built hundreds of thousands they'll have even better cars."
<p></p>
Increased fuel efficiency will save consumers money at the pump, increase national security by reducing the nation's reliance on oil, and help curb global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emission. Automakers could reach a 40-mpg standard using available technologies to improve conventional gasoline vehicles, 55 mpg by making the majority of their passenger vehicles hybrid-electrics, and up to 100 mpg by building a fleet of plug-in hybrids.

<i>The Freedom From Oil Campaign is working to end America's oil addiction, stop oil wars, and curb global warming by convincing the auto industry to dramatically improve fuel efficiency and eliminate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Launched by RAN, Global Exchange, and the Ruckus Society in 2003, the campaign is pushing automakers to break their addiction to oil, create more jobs, and meet consumer demand for green cars by producing more fuel efficient vehicles.
