<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - Former Senator John Edwards has agreed to be the first presidential candidate to spend a day on the job and at home with a member of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). <br />
<br />
SEIU members are urging all candidates, Democrats and Republicans, to experience firsthand what their lives are like. Instead of just talking to candidates at rallies or town hall meetings, SEIU members also want the candidates to get to know what life is really like for working families in America. <br />
<br />
“We’re thrilled that Senator Edwards has agreed to be the first presidential candidate to take time off of the campaign trail to walk in the shoes of one of our members,” said SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger. 
<p>“We look forward to working with other candidates to ensure that they are able to witness firsthand what it’s like for working families. If candidates understand the struggles workers face each day, then they’ll be better able to offer the solutions our country needs to create a new American Dream.” <br /><br />SEIU has launched a new web site on the “Walk a Day in My Shoes” campaign, <a href=" www.WalkADayInMyShoes2008.com">www.WalkADayInMyShoes2008.com</a>. The site features SEIU members talking about what they’re looking for in the next president, and will include video and photographs of SEIU members with the candidates on the campaign trail. <br /></p>
