<p>   WASHINGTON - October 9 –  “Congress’s hurried consideration of the Protect America Act was legislating at its worst.  Congress must fix the fundamental flaws of that legislation - the utter failure to protect the privacy of Americans at home and abroad, and the complete lack of meaningful judicial, congressional and administrative oversight.  Congress must act responsibly and not be intimidated into giving the administration unnecessary powers it could too easily abuse.  We can aggressively go after suspected terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets while still protecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans.
<P></P>
 

“The House Democratic leadership is right to refuse to grant immunity for alleged cooperation with the President’s warrantless wiretapping program -- it would be irresponsible to grant immunity when the Administration still refuses to provide Congress with its legal opinions justifying that program.  But any legislation to amend FISA also must protect the privacy of Americans in the U.S. making international communications.  Americans are communicating with people overseas more than ever before.  If an American businessperson wants to contact a foreign customer, or a student wants to email a friend she met while studying abroad, or a journalist wants to call a foreign source, they should not have to give up the protections granted to them by our Constitution.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
