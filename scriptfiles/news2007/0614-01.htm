<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 14 - It was 60 years ago that a band of dedicated liberal heavyweights recognized the need for an effective new organization to carry forward their ideals of social justice and international cooperation. So on January 4, 1947 they founded Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). The group consisted of such legendary figures as first lady to the world Eleanor Roosevelt, Minneapolis Mayor and future Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, United Auto Workers (UAW) President Walter Reuther, economist and Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) President David Dubinsky.

 

<P></P>In their inaugural statement, ADA’s founders captured the true essence of liberalism:

<P></P>“Liberalism is a demanding faith. It rests neither on a set of dogmas nor on a blueprint but is rather a spirit which each generation of liberals must learn to apply to the needs of its own time. This spirit itself is unchanging—a deep belief in the dignity of man, a faith in human reason and the power of free inquiry, a high sense of individual responsibility for oneself and one’s neighbor, a conviction that the best society is the one that enables the greatest number of its members to develop their potentialities to the utmost.”

 

<P></P>It is with that mission in mind that ADA celebrates its 60th Anniversary. For six decades ADA has personified a “liberalism that moves with the times”. Key movements that originated with ADA and often at the annual ADA Convention include establishing the 1948 Civil Rights plank at the Democratic Party Convention, leading the Fair Deal campaign, key opposition to McCarthyism, shining a light racial divisions in the South and organizing for change, initiation of the DC Vote movement, early call for the end of bombing in Vietnam and to enter into negotiations, active engagement in Nixon impeachment, and the endorsement of numerous liberal political candidates.

 

<P></P>ADA continues to advocate for progressive policy in Washington and across the country today through direct lobbying, public education, coalition building, and grassroots pressure. Our successful Working Families Win project helped educate and empower working families in 2006 by helping folks connect the dots between the policies adopted in Washington and their daily lives. The action that Working Families Win ignited produced marked results in securing representation in Washington that more closely resembles a progressive working families’ agenda. Current ADA leaders include Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA) who serves as ADA National President, House Financial Service Committee Chair Barney Frank (D-MA), noted economists James K. Galbraith and Jeff Faux, House Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers (D-MI), United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard, Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Tom Harkin (D-IA), former Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, House Ways and Mean Committee Chair Charles Rangel (D-NY) to name a few.

 

<P></P>The 60th Anniversary will be held in Washington, DC at the Gallaudet University’s Kellogg Center from June 21-24. National Director Amy Isaacs is available for interview or comment on this historic celebration before and during the events. A current agenda can be found online at <a href="http://www.adaction.org/convagenda07.pdf" target="_new">http://www.adaction.org/convagenda07.pdf</a>C
