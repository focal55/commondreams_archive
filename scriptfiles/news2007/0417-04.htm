<p>WASHINGTON, DC — The National Organic Standards Board (<a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/nosb/index.htm">NOSB</a>),
an expert advisory panel to the USDA’s National Organic Program, has
made it clear that organic agriculture should not allow the use of
cloned animals or their offspring in the production of organic food.
The NOSB voted at their spring meeting in Washington, DC to exclude
cloned animals, their offspring, and any food products from cloned
animals from the organic sector. </p>
	<p>“This is a victory for
farmers, consumers and retailers who want to protect organic food and
agriculture from a highly controversial and experimental technology,”
said Will Fantle of The Cornucopia Institute, a farm policy and organic
watchdog group. “This vote seeks to plant a flag squarely in the center
of the organic food sector, declaring it off limits to cloning while
providing consumers a clear choice in the marketplace,” Fantle added.<a id="more-240"></a></p>
	<p>The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced last December that they were ready to approve the commercialization of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cvm/CloneRiskAssessment.htm">cloning in livestock agriculture</a>
and indicated that they would not seek any identifying labels on cloned
meat, dairy and other food products sold in the nation’s grocery
stores. (The FDA has extended their public comment period on the cloned
food recommendation to May 3. A sample letter to the FDA can be found
at <a href="http://cornucopia.org/index.php/202">http://cornucopia.org/index.php/202</a>.)</p>

	<p>During
its three-day meeting, NOSB members wrestled with language aimed at
keeping cloning out of organics. Kevin Engelbert, vice-chair of the
NOSB’s Livestock Committee and an organic dairy farmer from the state
of New York, pressed hard for immediate and decisive action on the
controversial technology. During the Board’s deliberations, Engelbert
said “This is the time to make a strong statement.” He offered precise
language that was adopted by the NOSB to address cloning and the issue
of offspring from cloned animals. </p>
	<p>The Board’s recommendation
provides guidance to the National Organic Program’s administrator who
stated more than once during the meeting that the NOP wanted advice
from the Board on how to address cloned offspring and their food
products in the organic sector. “The NOSB’s vote offers exactly that
guidance, stated Fantle. “It calls for excluding all progeny of cloned
animals and their ‘succeeding generations’ from organic livestock
production as well as prohibiting any food products derived from
animals produced with cloning technology.” </p>
	<p>The 12-0 vote
(with one abstention) occurred after the NOSB heard public comments
over three days from numerous representatives of farm, consumer, retail
and non-profit groups calling for the cloning ban in organics
Cornucopia also presented the Board with a letter signed by 70
retailers and farm groups from across the country that supported a
cloning ban. </p>
	<p>Jim Riddle, former chair of the NOSB and author of <a href="http://www.organic-center.org/science.latest.php?action=view&amp;report_id=90">a cloning report</a>
for the Organic Center, was pleased with the recommendation. “I am
gratified to see that the NOSB has voted to prohibit cloned animals,
their products, and their progeny from organic agriculture,” Riddle
said. “Cloning,” added Riddle, “has no place in organic agriculture. As
the FDA’s own report shows, cloning is still very experimental with a
high failure rate, it’s inhumane and totally unnatural.”</p>
	<p>Representatives
from the Center for Food Safety, Consumers Union, and the Organic
Consumers Association were among those testifying in favor of a cloning
ban in organics. </p>

	<p>The action by the NOSB will likely add further support to <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200702/020807c.html">a bill</a>
introduced in the U.S. Senate by Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Herb Kohl
(D-WI) that would outlaw the use of cloned animals and their offspring
in organic food production. The bill, S536, is currently in the Senate
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.<!-- #EndEditable -->
