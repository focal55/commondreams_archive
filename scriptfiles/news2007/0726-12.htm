<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 26 - Today, Senators Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), 
          Russell Feingold (D-WI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called for the 
          appointment of a special counsel to investigate possible wrongdoing 
          by the Attorney General, originating with his statements regarding the 
          removal and replacement of several United States Attorneys, in addition 
          to his testimony before Congress regarding the Terrorist Surveillance 
          Program (TSP.) In a letter to Paul D. Clement, Solicitor General and 
          Acting Attorney General responsible for matters where Attorney General 
          Gonzales has recused himself, the senators called for a special counsel 
          to be appointed to examine the Attorney General’s statements on 
          the U.S. Attorney scandal, his testimony before Congress regarding the 
          TSP, and potential charges of obstruction of justice, false statements, 
and perjury.
<p>Earlier this week, Attorney General Gonzales testified before the Senate 
          Committee on the Judiciary in a Department of Justice Oversight hearing. 
          During questioning by several members of the Committee, the Attorney 
          General gave statements in conflict with his prior testimony before 
          Congress. Previously, Gonzales had testified that there had not been 
          any “serious disagreement” within the Administration regarding 
          a domestic warrantless wiretapping program known as the TSP. That notion 
          was sharply refuted in testimony by former Deputy Attorney General James 
          Comey, who recounted a disagreement so intense that it almost led to 
          his resignation, as well as that of John Ashcroft, Attorney General 
          at the time. In his testimony this week, Gonzales contradicted himself 
          by admitting that there had in fact been a dispute between the White 
          House—where he was Counsel at the time—and the Justice Department 
          over the TSP.</p>
        <p>Additionally, a number of the Attorney General’s answers were 
          in direct conflict with accounts from members of Congress and the Administration. 
          Specifically, the Attorney General responded that TSP was not discussed 
          at a March 10, 2004 briefing, despite a letter from John Negroponte, 
          former Director of National Intelligence, indicating that the TSP was 
          in fact the subject of that briefing. Testimony by CIA Director Michael 
          Hayden also confirms that the TSP was discussed at the March 10 briefing. 
        </p>
        <p>“Once again, Attorney General Gonzales has proven himself unable 
          to answer a few simple and straightforward questions,” Schumer 
          said. “He has now also given testimony that directly contradicts 
          accounts by other Administration officials and members of Congress. 
          The time has come for the Department of Justice to appoint an independent 
          special counsel—someone in the mold of Patrick Fitzgerald—to 
          clean up the mess that the Department of Justice has become under this 
          Attorney General.”</p>
        <p>“It is with great sadness that we come here today to call for 
          an independent special prosecutor to determine whether Attorney General 
          Gonzales may have misled Congress or perjured himself in testimony before 
          Congress,” Feinstein said. “Americans look to their Attorney 
          General to be above reproach, independent, and free from political influence. 
          They want a straight shooter, who will enforce the law no matter what. 
          But Alberto Gonzales has turned this office on its head.”</p>
        <p>“As the highest ranking law enforcement officer in the country, 
          the Attorney General has a special duty to be truthful and fully forthcoming 
          with Congress,” Feingold said. In his testimony, the Attorney 
          General has demonstrated a clear pattern of intentionally misleading 
          Congress about Deputy Attorney General James Comey and internal disputes 
          within the administration. A special counsel is needed to look into 
          the litany of misleading statements the Attorney General has made and 
          determine whether criminal charges are warranted.”</p>
        <p>“The Attorney General’s testimony this week left me no 
          choice but to believe that the Senate, and the American people, were 
          being misled about a matter of grave importance to our national security,” 
          Whitehouse said. “For the Bush administration to continue to assert 
          that it is above the law is simply unacceptable. We’re calling 
          for a special counsel because we need an independent, impartial investigation 
          to determine exactly what’s happened here, and to ensure accountability.”</p>

        <p>In this particular situation, where wrongdoing may have occurred at 
          the highest echelons of the Department’s management, an outside 
          special counsel is particularly important to ensure an independent and 
          even-handed investigation. </p>
        <p>In 2003, Senator Schumer was the first person to call for a special 
          counsel to be appointed in the Valerie Plame leak investigation. As 
          a direct consequence, Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed Special Prosecutor, 
          ultimately resulting in the indictment and conviction of former Chief 
          of Staff to the Vice President, Lewis “Scooter” Libby.</p>
