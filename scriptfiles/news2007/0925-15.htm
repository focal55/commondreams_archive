<p>  WASHINGTON - September 25 -  Today, Rep. George 
Miller (Calif.-D) took a critical first step toward ending the use of aircraft 
to hunt Alaska &nbsp;wolves and bears 
when he introduced the Protect America’s Wildlife (PAW) Act. </p>
<p>The act will close a 
loophole in the Airborne Hunting Act, which Alaska legislators and 
officials have exploited to permit private hunters to use planes to hunt, harass 
and kill wolves and bears. Under Alaska’s program, wolves 
can either be shot from the air or chased to exhaustion before landing and 
shooting them point blank.&nbsp; In some 
areas of the state, grizzly bears and black bears can also be killed by “land 
and shoot” hunting. Even mother bears with cubs are targeted.</p>
<p>“Alaska is flouting the will 
of Congress and exploiting a loophole in the Airborne Hunting Act, which was 
clearly intended to end aerial hunting by private citizens,” said Defenders of 
Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen. “To make matters worse, other states are 
now proposing to follow Alaska’s 
example.”</p>
<p>Under the guise of 
wildlife management, Alaska contends its current 
aerial hunting program is not hunting at all but constitutes legitimate wildlife 
management that artificially boosts wild moose and caribou populations.&nbsp; This goal has drawn serious criticism 
from the scientific community. </p>

<p>A letter sent today 
to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin from nearly 200 scientists states, “We urge the State 
of Alaska to consider the ecological role that large predators play in 
preventing eruptions and crashes [of prey populations], and to consider 
conservation and preservation of predators on an equal basis with the goal of 
producing more ungulates for hunters.”&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>For more than a 
decade, the citizens of Alaska have voiced 
opposition to much aerial wildlife hunting and have twice voted to put an end to 
the state’s use of aircraft to kill wolves. But each time, the legislature has 
overturned the will of the 
people.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“The intent of 
Alaska’s citizens is 
clear,” said Joel Bennett, former member of the Alaska Board of Game. “We have 
voted against the practice of private hunters using aircraft to hunt wolves 
twice now, only to have our vote overturned both times. It is 
obvious we need the support of Congress to close this loophole.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>For most hunters, the 
concept of fair chase is the cornerstone of hunting ethics. Many hunters 
are opposed to the use of aircraft to hunt because, among other reasons, it is 
not considered “fair-chase” hunting. </p>
<p>“Aerial hunting is 
not only a serious ethical issue but also a growing national issue. Congress 
recognized this when it passed the federal Airborne Hunting Act to stop the 
practice in Alaska. We are grateful to 
Rep. Miller, a true conservationist, for championing this legislation” added 
Schlickeisen.</p>
