<p>NORTHAMPTON, Mass. - March 14 - As Congress prepares to vote on a $100 billion supplemental bill for more war spending, the National Priorities Project (NPP) released today a new <a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=283&Itemid=" target="_new">state-level publication</a> that breaks down what that amount and the new total would cost each state and congressional district.  Also available are the number of soldiers killed and wounded from each state and examples of what the money spent on the Iraq War could buy each congressional district in local services.

<p>If Congress approves the additional $100 billion in war spending, the total amount allocated to the Iraq War will reach almost half a trillion dollars, according to Anita Dancs, research director of the National Priorities Project.  This figure does not include the additional $142 billion in war spending already requested by the Bush Administration for Fiscal Year 2008.

<p>"A price tag this high deserves every American's serious attention," said Greg Speeter, executive director of the National Priorities Project.  "With the upcoming vote, this publication can help voters inform themselves and their representatives about the high costs of this war."

<p><a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=283&Itemid=" target="_new">A Vote to Pay for More War?</a>, NPP's latest publication, will be distributed via national networks of organizations, legislators and the internet.  NPP's web pages on the cost of  the Iraq War receive at least 100,000 web hits each month.

<p><em>The <a href="http://www.nationalpriorities.org" target="_new">National Priorities Project </a>is a non-profit, non-partisan research organization that examines the local impact of federal policies
