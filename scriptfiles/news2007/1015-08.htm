<p>   WASHINGTON, DC - October 15 – Hundreds of healthcare workers, parents, children, faith leaders, and concerned citizens will gather for a vigil near the Capitol this Tuesday, October 16, as part of a final push to win healthcare for nearly 10 million children.
<p></p>
On Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m., the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) will host a prayer vigil and rally, urging Congress to override President Bush’s SCHIP veto.   The event is the culmination of a national grassroots and advertising campaign, and will take place two days prior to the scheduled veto override vote.
