<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - Coffee lovers the world
over are unknowingly drinking coffee that was illegally grown inside one of
the world's most important national parks for tigers, elephants and rhinos,
according to an investigative report released today by World Wildlife Fund
(WWF). Illegally grown coffee from Indonesia is mixed with legally grown
coffee beans and sold to such companies as Kraft Foods and Nestle among
other major companies in the United States and abroad.
  <p>  WWF tracked the illegal cultivation of coffee inside Indonesia's remote
Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBS) all the way through its export
routes to multinational coffee companies and the shelves of grocery stores
across the United States, Europe and Asia using satellite imaging,
interviews with coffee farmers and traders, and by monitoring coffee trade
routes. Trade of illegal coffee is possible because neither exporters nor
importers have any mechanisms in place to prevent the illegal beans from
entering the supply chains.
 <p>   Bukit Barisan Selatan, a World Heritage Site on the southern tip of
Sumatra Island, is one of the few protected areas where Sumatran tigers,
elephants and rhinos coexist. It has already lost nearly 30 percent of its
forest cover to illegal agriculture, most of which is for coffee
production.
  <p>  "No consumer wants their morning cup of coffee to contribute to the
demise of endangered tigers," said Carter Roberts, President and CEO of
WWF-US. "The findings in this report illustrate the challenge of ensuring
that global trade respects environmental concerns. We're raising awareness
of the issue but we're also actively working with companies to implement
constructive solutions to the problem"
   <p> Indonesia is the world's second-largest exporter of robusta, a kind of
bean often used in instant and packaged coffee sold in supermarkets. At
least half the country's coffee is exported through the port of Lampung,
adjacent to the national park.
  <p>  WWF's investigation found farmers growing coffee on more than 173
square miles of park land (about two-thirds the size of Chicago) and
producing more than 19,600 tons of coffee there each year. Most wildlife
has already abandoned the sections of the park that have been illegally
converted to coffee plantations. Illegally grown coffee is exported to at
least 52 countries.
<p>    The report determined that most of the companies buying the coffee
likely were unaware of its illegal origins. WWF provided draft copies of
the report's findings to the top recipients of Lampung coffee tainted with
illegal beans from Bukit Barisan Selatan. The reaction of the companies has
been mixed. Some companies are currently in discussion with WWF on how to
avoid purchases of illegally grown coffee, boost production of sustainably
grown coffee and restore wildlife habitat in the park, while others have
denied any purchasing of illegally grown coffee.
    <p>"These companies can do better," continued Roberts. "The multinational
coffee companies mentioned in this report should implement rigorous
chain-of- custody controls to ensure that they no longer buy illegally
grown coffee, as well as support park protection and restoration efforts."
  <p>  WWF is also asking involved coffee-buying companies to work with local
Sumatran growers and traders to provide incentives to switch to sustainable
coffee production outside the park. The report recommends that Indonesian
authorities prevent further encroachment into the park and develop
regulations that prevent illegally grown coffee from infiltrating
international trade.
  <p>  Worldwide, WWF engages with a variety of businesses to improve their
product sourcing. Part of WWF's overall strategy is to help companies find
better ways to use their purchasing power to promote better agricultural
and forestry practices.
 <p>   Editors' Notes:

   <p> * The report Gone in an Instant can be downloaded at
      http://www.worldwildlife.org/coffee

   <p> * WWF's investigation found that in 2003, exported unwashed coffee beans
      leaving Lampung -- tainted with coffee grown illegally in BBS National
      Park -- totaled 216,000 tons. Export volume increased to 283,000 tons in
      2004 and 335,000 tons in 2005.
<p>
    * The United States, Germany, Japan and Italy were the largest importing
      countries of tainted Lampung coffee in 2004 and 2005, accounting for
      more than 50 per cent of all coffee imports from the region. Other
      significant recipient countries include Algeria, India and the United
      Kingdom.

   <p> * Records of the Cooperative, Industry and Trade Service of Lampung
      Province show that Taloca, Kraft and Nestlé were the top recipients of
      coffee from Lampung in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.
      Other companies identified as recipients of Lampung coffee include
      Marubeni, Itochu, ED&F Man, Andira, Nestle, Lavazza, J. Mueller Weser,
      Pacorini and World Transport. Folgers (P&G) and Tchibo have also
      received small shipments of coffee from Bandar Lampung's exporters.

 <p>   * One company, Nestle, has responded to the report, launching an effort to
      clean up part of its supply chain and advise farmers on how to produce
      higher quality coffee. Some of the coffee companies approached by WWF
      have also indicated they are willing to support the development of
      sustainable, legal coffee production outside the park. This would ensure
      a reliable market for coffee farmers and provide a reliable, sustainable
      source of legal coffee for the companies. And the park's rhinos, tigers
      and elephants will benefit from having production and its subsequent
      environmental damage moved outside the park boundaries.

  <p>  * To further this effort, WWF has entered into an alliance with
      ForesTrade, a company with a long history of establishing sustainable
      development programs in Sumatra, and Rainforest Alliance, an
      organization best known for its global efforts to certify sustainably
      produced coffee. WWF is also in discussions with the new Common Code for
      the Coffee Community Association (4C), whose founding members include
      several recipients of illegal coffee. The aim is to encourage 4C members
      to help prevent further damage to BBS NP and undo the damage coffee
      production has already done to the park and its wildlife.

   <p> * The Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park is believed to be home to
      approximately 40 adult tigers. There are fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers
      left in the wild and they are considered critically endangered. The park
      is home to an estimated 500 Sumatran elephants, 25 per cent of the
      remaining population of the endangered subspecies. It is also home to an
      estimated 60-85 Sumatran rhinos, the largest population on the island,
      where they are found in only three other national parks. Sumatran rhinos
      are critically endangered.
