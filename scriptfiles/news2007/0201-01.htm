<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - <font size="2" face="Arial">The 2007 farm bill recommendations released by the Bush administration's Department of Agriculture increase overall funding for conservation initiatives, but undercut the farm programs’ important focus on wildlife, according to Defenders of Wildlife. </font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">"Although we are pleased to see an increase in the amount of acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program and stronger protection of native grasslands, we are very disappointed that the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program and the Grasslands Reserve Program have been effectively eliminated as independent programs," stated Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife.  "The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program is a proven and effective initiative for conserving native species with a large backlog of producers waiting to get in. We do not want to see it diluted by sweeping it into a program largely focused on nutrient management and water quality problems."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The administration's proposal also includes a substantial investment in biofuels. "The emphasis on cellulosic ethanol is encouraging" said Schlickeisen, "but the Administration's proposal to promote biofuel production on lands set aside for conservation under the Conservation Reserve Program is misguided.  These lands serve important conservation purposes, including protecting habitat for many species of wildlife, and should not be diverted into fuel production." </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The farm bill has a significant impact on wildlife conservation.  With nearly 40 percent of our country's threatened or endangered wildlife found only on private lands, how farmers, ranchers and foresters manage those lands will determine the future of many species.   
The conservation title of the farm bill is our largest source of federal funding for natural resource conservation, providing an average of $3 billion per year between 2002 and 2006, exceeding funding for the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act combined.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">"The 2007 farm bill should encourage farmers, ranchers and other landowners to coordinate wildlife-related conservation with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategies in each state," said Schlickeisen.  "Linking to these state wildlife plans will ensure that farm bill funded conservation programs produce meaningful, strategic benefits for wildlife."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To improve upon the conservation titles in the farm bill, Defenders will work with Congress to implement the following recommendations:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Ensure that funding for farm bill conservation programs is maintained at least at current levels</strong>, and that programs that provide significant wildlife benefit, such as the Grasslands Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve Programs, continue to have dedicated funding.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Support the development of biofuels production capacity in the United States</strong> while taking into account the needs of wildlife and preserving environmental quality. Defenders opposes using the environmentally-sensitive lands protected through the Conservation Reserve Program or fast-disappearing native prairie lands to grow biofuels crops. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Promote strategic conservation</strong> by linking wildlife-related proposals under the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program and other conservation programs to state Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategies that establish priorities for wildlife conservation, and by increasing funding for long-term conservation projects aimed at at-risk species. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Expand the Wetlands Reserve Programs</strong> to include funding for riparian habitat protection. In much of the western and southwestern U.S., riparian lands are major component of those states' wetlands and contain some of the most important wildlife habitat for many species, particularly migratory birds.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Allow wildlife to be a resource of concern that all agricultural producers can address throughout the Conservation Security Program.</strong> </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Increase the acreage level for the Grasslands Reserve Program</strong> from two million to 10 million acres and set a goal for enrollment of at least two million acres of native grasslands. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Expand the Environmental Quality Incentives Program</strong> to fund nationwide proactive predator deterrence for large endangered carnivores. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Pass a "Sodsaver" provision</strong> that would disallow federal farm benefits on newly broken grasslands. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Congress will soon be drafting the 2007 farm bill, and is expected to enact the legislation by this fall. </font></p>
