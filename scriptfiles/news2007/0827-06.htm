<p>WASHINGTON - August 27 -While the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is great news for the country, it's doubly great news for a political science professor from Middlebury, VT, who will be celebrating with a year's worth of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.

 

<P></P>The 50 pints of premium ice cream are the professor's prize for accurately guessing the date and time of Gonzales' resignation as part of a contest run by TrueMajorityAction.org, a grassroots citizen's lobby group.

 

<P></P>In March, when word emerged about Gonzales' office firing U.S. Attorneys for political reasons, TrueMajorityAction.org started an office pool to predict when Mr. Gonzales was going to resign and invited all their online members to join. More than 36,000 people nationwide entered guesses, but after six months of speculation the winning TrueMajorityAction.org member came within 20 minutes of the exact time that Gonzales publicly announced his resignation.

 

<P></P>"It's an important moment," said TrueMajorityAction.org executive director Matt Holland. "My own prediction was that Gonzales would be gone months ago, but any day that an opponent of the Constitution and international law leaves town is a good day."

 

<P></P>TrueMajorityAction.org members opposed the confirmation of Gonzales from the start, and have repeatedly urged their members of Congress to oppose his policies. Beginning this morning, those same grassroots activists are calling on Congress to only confirm a new Attorney General who promises to restore civil liberties curtailed under Gonzales.
