<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 26 - The American Civil Liberties Union called on Congress today 
to reaffirm itself as an equal branch of government and vote to hold White House 
officials in contempt for refusing to cooperate with legitimate congressional 
subpoenas. Calling this a constitutional crisis that threatens to destroy the 
separation of powers, the ACLU reminded Congress that its oversight and 
legislative role are vital.</p>
<p>"Presidents have tried in the past to overreach in claiming executive 
privilege," said Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington 
Legislative Office. "However, Congress has long served as a check to such abuses 
of power, slapping the president’s hand when needed and pursuing contempt or 
enforcement actions that eventually resulted in the release of crucial 
information. Today’s Congress must do the same if it wishes to remain a 
meaningful and independent branch of government."</p>
<p>The ACLU rejected claims that Congress’ responsibility to conduct oversight 
or investigate executive misconduct was somehow less important than its 
legislative function and therefore not worthy of compulsory enforcement.</p>

<p>Fredrickson added, "It’s do-or-die time for the separation of powers. 
Congress is facing a historic moment when it can fight for its rightful place in 
our Constitution or accept the president’s continued and sweeping claims of 
supremacy."</p>
<p>U.S. courts have long supported Congress’ authority not only to pass laws, 
but also to investigate their application. The courts have asserted that claims 
of executive privilege are a potentially dangerous proposition that should only 
be applied, and can only be upheld, under narrow circumstances. Such privilege 
cannot be used as a means to hide government wrongdoing, and cannot stand in the 
face of Congress’ demonstrated need for the information.<br>
