<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the introduction of 
the Prevention First Act by Representatives Louise Slaughter (D - NY) and Diana 
DeGette (D - CO) in the House of Representatives. Like the companion bill 
introduced by Senator Harry Reid (D - NV), the Prevention First Act is a packet 
of proposals aimed at improving women&#8217;s reproductive health and reducing the 
need for abortion by preventing unintended pregnancies.</P>
<P>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</P>
<P>"The Prevention First Act is a proactive, commonsense measure to protect the 
reproductive health of all women. The bill should appeal to people across the 
political spectrum, as it seeks to reduce the need for abortion by providing 
women with the means and education to prevent unintended pregnancies in the 
first place. It would prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases by 
expanding access to contraception. It would improve the health of women and 
their children by increasing funding for reproductive health care. And it would 
provide compassionate assistance for survivors of sexual assault, by ensuring 
information and access to emergency contraception upon request. These are 
mainstream proposals that will go a long way toward improving the lives of all 
women. The ACLU supports this important legislation, and we hope it receives the 
bipartisan support it deserves."<!-- #EndEditable -->
