WASHINGTON- September 6 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said her organization is mobilizing its grassroots activists in support of a proposal to repeal the dangerous global gag rule.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Olympia Snowe's (R-ME) amendment to the FY '08 foreign-aid spending bill would fully repeal a policy that bans overseas health clinics from receiving U.S. family-planning aid if they use their own funds to provide legal abortion services, give referrals, or even take a public pro-choice position.&nbsp; U.S. funds do not pay for abortion-related services.</p>
<p>"We applaud these senators' effort to improve health-care options for the world's poorest women," Keenan said.&nbsp; "Family planning is basic medical care.&nbsp; It continues to astound me that President Bush wants to deny services that help the world's poorest women prevent unintended pregnancy and protect themselves from disease.&nbsp; It's time to end this hypocrisy."</p>
<p>In late June, the House passed a modest "contraceptive supplies" exemption to allow otherwise ineligible overseas health clinics to receive U.S.-donated condoms and contraceptives.&nbsp; While this was a good first step, the Boxer-Snowe amendment goes even farther by repealing this dangerous policy in its entirety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The global gag rule has had devastating effects on family-planning services overseas," Keenan said.&nbsp; "As a consequence of the policy, overseas groups have closed health centers, cut staff, and raised fees.&nbsp; The global gag rule has also cut off supplies of condoms in some areas and silenced human-rights organizations. NARAL Pro-Choice America has long opposed this indefensible policy, and continues to urge lawmakers to work toward its ultimate repeal." <!-- #EndEditable -->
