<p>ELEVEN US CITIES - October 26 - United for Peace and Justice, the country's
largest anti war coalition and organizer of the October 27th National
Day of Action to End the War in Iraq, today spoke out against
unilateral sanctions against Iran as announced by the Bush
Administration today.
<p class="MsoNormal">Leslie Cagan, the National Coordinator of UFPJ,
said, "We are horrified that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has
announced new belligerent measures against Iran. Five years ago the
Bush administration lied to us about weapons of mass destruction and
so-called threats from Iraq. Those lies were the basis for a war that
is now one of the longest military engagements in U.S. history, with
outrageous human and economic cost. Are we about to be dragged into
another war that could be avoided? On Saturday, October 27th, around
the country we will demand an end to the war in Iraq, and no new war
against Iran. The killing must stop, it must stop now!"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Robert Naiman, chair of the No War on Iran Working
Group of UFPJ, called on Congress to immediately pass legislation to
prohibit the Bush administration from attacking Iran without explicit
congressional authorization and to reject funding for new "bunker
buster" weapons that could be used to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal" align="left">United for Peace and
Justice has planned 11 regional anti-war demonstrations scheduled in
cities across the country on Saturday, October 27. The demonstrations
call for an end to the war in Iraq and no new war against Iran.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">For more information about the October 27th actions visit <a href="http://www.oct27.org/" target="_new">www.oct27.org</a> or <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" target="_new">www.unitedforpeace.org</a><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><em>United for Peace and
Justice is a coalition of more than 1400 local and national groups
throughout the United States who have joined together to protest the
immoral and disastrous Iraq War and oppose our government's policy of
permanent warfare and empire-building. For more details go to <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" target="_new">www.unitedforpeace.org</a><o:p></o:p></em><o:p></o:p></p>
