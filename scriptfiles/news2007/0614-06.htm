<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 14 - Raising captive tigers for trade in tiger parts was rejected by CITES member countries today and <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> was urged to phase out its large-scale commercial tiger farms, a major victory for wild tiger conservation, according to World Wildlife Fund and TRAFFIC. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Four countries with wild tigers – <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Bhutan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> – were joined by the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> in giving <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> a mandate to phase out the country’s privately run “tiger farms” that house nearly 5,000 tigers and that are pushing the Chinese government to allow legal trade in tiger parts. With leadership from these countries, the 171 member countries of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) adopted by consensus a strong decision to protect tigers from trade.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">"Today the world spoke in favor of wild tiger conservation," said Simon Habel, head of <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> delegation at CITES for World Wildlife Fund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No voice was stronger than the U.S. government’s, which encouraged countries to pass a rule that clearly states that tigers should not be bred in captivity for trade in tiger parts.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Investors in massive, captive tiger breeding centers in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> have been pressuring the Chinese government to lift its successful 14-year-old ban on trade in tiger parts so they can legally sell products like tiger bone wine and tiger meat. These facilities have acknowledged stockpiling tiger carcasses in the hopes that the trade ban will be lifted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">“The future of tigers just got a lot brighter with this significant decision”, said Crawford Allan, director, TRAFFIC <st1:place>North America</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“All agree that we can not take the slightest risk by changing policies that could further endanger the tiger further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next step is to hold an emergency tiger trade summit to establish real measures to stop the poaching and trade of tigers.” </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>WWF and TRAFFIC, along with a coalition of other organizations working on tigers, have offered guidance and technical support to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> on shutting down its tiger farms and stepping up law enforcement efforts to stamp out illegal trade of tiger parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> has been in behind the scenes negotiations for over a week and a half and has played an integral role in several decisions that will make it even more difficult for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> to justify lifting their domestic ban on trade.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Notes to Editors:</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Habitat loss and intense poaching of tigers and their prey, combined with inadequate government efforts to maintain tiger populations, have resulted in a dramatic reduction in tiger numbers. These big cats now occupy just 7 percent of their historical range, according to the BioScience paper.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> And the possibility that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9pt;">China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> could reopen trade in parts harvested from farmed tigers represents a new threat, the authors say.</p>
