<p>WASHINGTON  - February 13 - 
<P>WHO:    Over 50 religious and secular peace activists arrested on
             Capitol Hill last September for acts of non-violent civil
             resistance to the war in Iraq

<P> WHAT:   Trial on charges of Unlawful Assembly and Crossing a Police Line

<P> WHERE:  District of Columbia Superior Court, 500 Indiana Ave., NW,
             Washington, DC

<P>WHEN:   Valentine's Day - Wednesday, February 14, 9:00 a.m.
<P> BACKGROUND: On September 26 and 27, 2006, hundreds of non-violent
protesters converged on Capitol Hill to bear witness to their opposition to
the US occupation of Iraq. The protests were organized by the National
Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance as part of a nationally coordinated
campaign called the Declaration of Peace, in which thousands of people
around the country participated in dozens of non-violent actions against
the war. The defendants in Wednesday's trial are being tried by the
government on charges of unlawful assembly in the Hart Senate Office
Building and crossing a police line in several other actions on Capitol
Hill over the two days of actions targeting Congress, and face possible
jail time and fines if convicted.
<P> It is significant that the government had chosen a mass trial of so
many defendants, with at least two different legal charges and at least
four different arrest scenarios, though just yesterday, a prosecutor
disclosed that the plan is to try each defendant individually. The pro se
defendants will move for dismissal of the government's charges.
<P> While coincidental, the timing of the trial is also noteworthy, in that
the new Congress is debating legislation on Iraq this week, and activists
around the country are conducting and planning sit-ins in congressional
offices to demand that Congress stop funding the war and occupation of
Iraq. This new initiative, dubbed the Occupation Project, kicked off last
week with a sit-in at Sen. John McCain's Capitol Hill office and in
congressional offices around the country. Maryland activists plan a sit-in
at Sen. Barbara Mikulski's office (503 Hart Senate Office Building,
Constitution Ave. and 2nd St., NE) this Thursday, February 15 at 10:30 am.
