<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - The American Civil Liberties Union today commended the House Judiciary 
Committee for holding its first hearing of the 110th Congress to 
examine President Bush&#8217;s use of presidential &#8220;signing statements.&#8221;&nbsp; Since taking office, President Bush has 
issued such statements affecting more than 750 laws, often claiming a right to 
not enforce laws passed by Congress. 
<P>&#8220;When 
Congress sends a law to the president for signature it is not asking for his 
comments.&nbsp; The Constitution doesn&#8217;t 
provide for the president to cherry pick which laws &#8211; or which parts of the laws 
&#8211; he will enforce. The Founding Fathers of our country designed a system that 
works when Congress writes the laws and the president implements them,&#8221; said 
Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. &#8220;The 
president needs to respect the separation of powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>Article 
II of the Constitution clearly states the president &#8220;shall take Care that the 
Laws be faithfully executed.&#8221;&nbsp; In 
most cases, President Bush&#8217;s signing statements have said he will refuse to 
enforce part of a law because it conflicts with his extraordinary claims of 
executive authority.&nbsp; The statements 
have covered numerous issues, including a congressional ban on the use of 
torture, affirmative action rules, protection for the integrity of scientific 
research and whistleblower protections.&nbsp; 
Such steps, the ACLU noted, defy the constitutional powers of Congress, 
and undermine the system of checks and balances. </P>
<P>In 
December 2006, President Bush issued a signing statement regarding H.R. 6407, 
the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006.&nbsp; The act reiterated the decades-long 
prohibition on opening First Class mail of domestic origin without a 
warrant.&nbsp; An existing regulation 
allows for the opening of mail without a warrant only in narrowly defined cases 
where the Postal Inspector believes there is a credible threat that the package 
contains dangerous material like bombs.&nbsp; 
The president's signing statement suggests that he is assuming broader 
authority to open mail without a warrant.</P>
<P>The 
ACLU and the Center for National Security Studies have filed three Freedom of 
Information Act requests seeking the immediate release of records related to 
that signing statement.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bravo 
to the Judiciary Committee for looking into this flagrant attempt to circumvent 
the will of Congress and thus the will of the people,&#8221; added Fredrickson. </P>
