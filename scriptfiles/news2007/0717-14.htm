<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 17 - Farm Sanctuary, the nation’s leading farm animal protection organization, is calling on the public to boycott Amazon.com for carrying and distributing foie gras products originating from the notorious Elevages Perigord, a production facility currently under investigation for extreme acts of animal cruelty.

 

<P></P>Today Farm Sanctuary released explicit undercover footage to the public that captures the wanton and senseless brutality committed by workers which clearly violates Canadian welfare laws. These include:

 

<P></P>•           Tearing the heads of live ducks off

<P></P>•           Kicking, throwing and punching ducks

<P></P>•           Leaving ducklings to die of hypothermia and asphyxiation inside trash cans

<P></P>•           Bashing live ducks against walls and floors

<P></P>•           Suffocating and crushing live ducklings

<P></P>•           Force feeding ducks

<P></P>•           Slaughter of fully-conscious ducks

 

<P></P>“It is unconscionable for Amazon and other suppliers to continue selling foie gras given the irrefutable evidence that it is produced through egregious callousness and cruelty,” said Gene Baur, president of Farm Sanctuary. “The footage we have released has broken the silence and made the public more aware than ever of the dirty secrets behind the doors of foie gras production facilities. To support any business that sells, produces or distributes this product is to take part in a callous disregard for life. We urge everyone to contact Amazon and tell them to stop selling foie gras immediately.”

 

<P></P>Farm Sanctuary attempted to open a dialogue with Amazon about the issue, but their inquiries went unanswered. 

 

<P></P>Ducks and geese used in foie gras production are de-beaked, de-toed and forced to live in extreme confinement in filthy, poorly-maintained cages. Liquid feed is pressure-pumped down their throats through a metal pipe several times a day. This force feeding is known to cause bruising, lacerations, sores, organ rupture, and even death. It also creates the grossly oversized and diseased “fatty liver” for which foie gras is named. Gasping, vomiting and struggling to move, the birds endure this process every day at the end of their short lives.
