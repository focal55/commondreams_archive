<p>   WASHINGTON, DC - October 11 – Families USA, the national organization for health care consumers, today launched the first in a series of documents  that aim to dispel the myths about the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) legislation that have been propagated by the Bush Administration. These inaccuracies are misleading and have confused members of Congress and the public about the bipartisan compromise bill that passed both houses of Congress by wide margins.
<p></p>
“The Administration’s criticisms of the children’s health bill are shamefully inaccurate,” said Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA. “The President is entitled to his opinion, but he should not hurt children—especially by misstating the facts.”
<p></p>
The first myth in the series “CHIP-ing Away at the Myths” deals with the myth of a government takeover of the health care industry:
<p></p>
* The vetoed bill simply continues a program that has worked well for the past 10 years and extends coverage to uninsured children in low-income families who are currently eligible for it. Children enrolled in CHIP receive their care through private plans, mostly managed care, and are treated by private doctors and hospitals.
<p></p>
* The bill is supported by organizations such as America’s Health Insurance Plans (which represents the health insurance industry), PhRMA (which represents the pharmaceutical industry), and the American Medical Association—organizations with long histories of opposing government-controlled health care.
<p></p>
* The key Republicans who crafted this compromise bill with leading Democrats, Senators such as Orrin Hatch (UT), Chuck Grassley (IO), and Pat Roberts (KS), are strong opponents of a government takeover of the health industry.
<p></p>
* CHIP has always been, and will continue to be, a block grant that is administered by each of the states. This means its funding is capped at a specific amount each year that may not be exceeded. It is not an entitlement program, and it is carefully confined to cover a portion of uninsured children whose families can’t otherwise obtain health coverage.
<p></p>
“As key Republican Senators have told the President, it is high time that he and his advisors read the bill,” said Pollack. “They either have chosen to remain uninformed, or they are purposely repeating falsehoods. America’s children deserve much better than that.”
