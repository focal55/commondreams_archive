<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 3 -  Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) and 13 Members of the House and Senate sent a letter to the National Conference on Weight &amp; Measures, urging them to issue a policy permitting the installation of temperature adjustment equipment at U.S. retail gasoline pumps. This technology would ensure that a gallon of gasoline pumped in the summer has the same energy content as a gallon pumped in the winter.&nbsp; It would also potentially save consumers an estimated $1.5 billion in hot fuel overcharges just this summer alone. The National Conference on Weights &amp; Measures is slated to meet at its annual meeting July 8, 2007 - July 12, 2007.</p>

<p align="left">"The National Conference on Weights and Measures should promote the most accurate measurement of gasoline, which takes the temperature of the gasoline into account.&nbsp; Consumers could thereby expect a considerable cost savings as well," Kucinich said. </p>

<p align="left">The oil industry has known for 100 years that gasoline expands with temperature. As it warms, gasoline expands by volume but not by weight or energy content. Since the 1920's, the oil industry has taken temperature into account for wholesale transactions, and uses a 60 degree Fahrenheit standard when measuring gasoline at wholesale. <script><!--

The study was finished in 1917, and since that time the industry has used a 60 degree standard for all wholesale transactions.  Retail transactions, however, get no such adjustment.  This is simply unacceptable.
