<p>WASHINGTON - February 8 - <font face="Arial">Standing with the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and national labor and civic leaders, SEIU today helped launch a historic, new cooperative effort with the goal of fundamentally changing the nation’s broken health care system.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The founding members of the new partnership, which was announced at a Washington, DC, news conference, are SEIU and Wal-Mart, the largest health care union and the largest corporation in North America, respectively; AT&amp;T; Intel; Kelly Services, Inc.; Communications Workers of America; the Center for American Progress; the Howard H. Baker, Jr. Center for Public Policy; and the Committee for Economic Development.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">“What unites us to be here today, and will continue to hold us together is our belief that it will be a far greater America when we finally get health care for every man woman and child,” said Andy Stern, President of SEIU.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The coalition will mobilize leaders from the business, labor, and political worlds – as well as individuals – in the growing movement to overhaul the nation’s health care system.&#160; Together, the founders pledged to recruit 50 additional partners, seek support from lawmakers, and launch innovative public education campaigns to rally customers and workers alike in the fight for a new American health care system.&#160; </font></p><p><font face="Arial">The coalition also released a set of shared principles to guide the overhaul of the health care system, committing to bring about fundamental change by the year 2012.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">“It is time to admit that the employer based health care is dead,” Stern said.&#160; “We can’t keep tinkering, hoping that incremental change will fix our broken health care system.&#160; We need fundamental change, and it is going to take new thinking, leadership, new partnerships, some risk taking, and compromising to make it happen.&#160; But that is what we all owe our country.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As the largest union of health care workers in North America, SEIU has led the effort to fundamentally reshape the nation’s health care system.&#160; Last summer, SEIU President Andy Stern wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and sent letters to every Fortune 500 CEO in the country, challenging them to partner with SEIU to develop a new model that solves the health care crisis for American workers and businesses alike.&#160;</font></p>
