<p>WASHINGTON - September 13 - What do Americans think
about the Bush Administration's proposed rule changes that would ease
environmental regulations so that the coal industry can step up "mountain
top removal" (MTR) coal mining, leveling up to 700 U.S. mountains and
nearby areas over the next decade?
   <P></P> A major new Opinion Research Corporation (ORC) survey to be released at
1:30 p.m. EDT on September 13, 2007 by the nonprofit and nonpartisan Civil
Society Institute (CSI) will gauge public views about the new Bush
Administration plan. At the same time, CSI will launch a major new
Web-based campaign to encourage Americans to comment on the proposed
Department of Interior/Office of Surface Mining (OSM) rules and
simultaneously express their views to their elected members of Congress.
      <P></P>The OSM public comment period on the controversial rules expires on
October 23, 2007.
      <P></P>News event speakers will be:

     <P></P>-- Civil Society Institute President and Founder Pam Solo;<br>
    -- Opinion Research Corporation Senior Researcher Graham Hueber;<br>
    -- Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC) Outreach Organizer Maria
       Gunnoe; and<br>
    -- Teri Blanton, member and former state chair of Kentuckians for the
       Commonwealth, a 4,000-member citizen's organization that speaks out on
       MTR coal mining and other issues of concern.
      <P></P>TO PARTICIPATE: You can join this live, phone-based news conference
(with full, two-way Q&A) at 1:30 p.m. EDT on September 13, 2007 by dialing

news event.
