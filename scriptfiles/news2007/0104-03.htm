<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 - Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), described the new ethics package proposed by the Democratic House leadership this week as a promising move toward a cleaner Congress.<br />
<br />
Highlights of the legislation include earmark reform, a ban on gifts and meals from lobbyists, mandatory pre-approval of any trips in connection with official duties, coupled with almost immediate disclosure of such trips, and the end of the use of corporate jets at under-market rates.<br />
<br />
Melanie Sloan, CREW’s executive director said, “The new Democratic leadership deserves credit for introducing legislation that tackles the ethics issues that plagued the last Congress.”  <br />
<br />
CREW particularly praises the proposal’s aggressive earmark reform provisions, which require disclosure of the authors and beneficiaries of all earmarks, limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits. Additionally, the author must certify that he or she does not benefit from the inserted earmark.  If earmarks are not disclosed according to the new rules, any member of Congress can raise a point of order that would strike that portion of the bill.       <br />
<br />
Sloan cautioned that the new ethics legislation is a strong first step, but more must be done.  “Although this bill provides a path to a better, more accountable House of Representatives,” said Sloan, “enforcement is the key to ethics reform. Congress must create an independent ethics oversight body, such as an Office of Public Integrity, to restore public confidence in Congress.”<br />
<br />
“Finally,” Sloan continued, “to guarantee enforcement, House rules must be changed to permit outsiders to file ethics complaints.” <br />
