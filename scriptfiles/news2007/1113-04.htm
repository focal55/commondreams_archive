<p>ATLANTA, GA - November 13 - Jared Feuer, Southern Regional Director of Amnesty International USA (AIUSA), released the following statement after the Georgia Supreme Court hearing for Troy Anthony Davis:
<P></P>
"Today, the Georgia Supreme Court will begin considering whether to grant a new trial for Troy Anthony Davis. It is essential that the Court is undertaking such a review, but a shame that it has to intervene at all.
<P></P>
"More than 18 years ago, Davis was charged quickly and under dubious circumstances. When some witnesses later admitted to making false statements and others alleged coercive police tactics, authorities should have jumped to attention. Instead, they ignored the evidence in the name of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, legislation that was never intended for this type of case. As a result, it is far from certain that the right person is behind bars.
<P></P>
"Clearly this case presents serious questions -- not only about Troy Davis' conviction, but also the administration of the death penalty in Georgia. Investigators never recovered a murder weapon and there was a complete absence of any physical evidence. Now that seven of nine original witnesses have recanted or changed their testimony, the original case has no legs. A new trial can help ensure that unanswered questions are laid to rest, and that Georgia will not risk executing an innocent man."
