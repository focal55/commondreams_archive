<p>WASHINGTON - September 4 - Dr. Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, is one of more than 1,000 people across the country fasting today to call attention to the global warming crisis and the need for bold congressional action on the issue.
<P></P>
"Global warming is the most serious long-term threat to the health and well being of people and the environment," Blackwelder said, explaining his participation in the fast. "If we don't start cutting greenhouse gas emissions right now, the consequences 50 to 100 years from now are going to be catastrophic. By fasting, we hope to call attention to this crisis and generate more pressure on Congress to take the lead on this issue."
<P></P>
Today's Climate Emergency Fast is the first-ever national action of its kind and is being coordinated by the U.S. Climate Emergency Council.
<P></P>
Fasters are calling upon the U.S. Congress to pass strong climate legislation this fall which would include a moratorium on any new coal plants, a freeze and major reductions of carbon emissions, and a $25 billion down payment in fiscal year 2008 for conservation, efficiency and renewables.
<P></P>
In addition to Blackwelder, those fasting around the country include author and activist Bill McKibben, Rev. Bob Edgar, former General Secretary of the National Council of Churches, Rev. Jim Wallis of Sojourners, Rev. Lennox Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus, Rt. Rev. Chilton Knudsen, Episcopal Bishop of Maine, Rabbi Warren Stone, Environmental Chair of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, Medea Benjamin of Code Pink, Van Jones of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, Mike Tidwell of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network and Ilyse Hogue of MoveOn.
