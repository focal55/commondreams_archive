<p>TEL AVIV - February 2 - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is deeply concerned about the consequences of the recent armed violence in the Gaza Strip. According to hospital sources, at least 17 persons were killed and 175 wounded in the clashes between Palestinian factions that erupted again yesterday.<br>
<br>
Since 25 January, fighting have left at least 50 dead and over 200 injured. Many victims have been by-standers and children.<br>
<br>
&quot;All those involved have an obligation to respect and protect people who are not or no longer taking direct part in the fighting&quot;, said Christoph Harnisch, head of the ICRC delegation. &quot;By-standers must not suffer the effects of violence.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ICRC reminds all those engaged in the ongoing acts of armed violence that they must abide by the above-mentioned principles of humanity that also include duty to protect and enable the work of personnel, vehicles and facilities that provide emergency medical services. Such services must function effectively and without hindrance at all times in order to limit the suffering caused by the fighting.<!-- #EndEditable -->
