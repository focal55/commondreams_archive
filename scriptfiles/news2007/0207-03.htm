<p>NEW YORK - February 7 - Month-long campaign in the United Sates and Canada invites diners to “Save a Life in 30 Days”  

<p>Starting in April, restaurant diners in 25 cities across the US and Canada will help save lives around the world as part of a newly launched campaign, Restaurants Against Hunger, which is being organized by two nonprofit organizations, with distinguished histories of success,  to reduce global hunger.  Some of the nation’s most prominent restaurants are joining the campaign to raise funds for Action Against Hunger because they help the world’s most vulnerable people during times of emergency and provide long-term solutions to prevent hunger and make access to safe drinking water possible.  Action Against Hunger has reached more than 4 million people in over 40 countries. 

 

<p>Together, with world-famous culinary professionals from Chefs for Humanity, Action Against Hunger invites restaurant diners to be a part of Restaurants Against Hunger and “save a life in 30 days.”  “We join into the hunger campaign with great excitement.  Restaurants are such a great place to ask people to give back a little for hunger after their fine dining experience.” states President and Founder of Chefs for Humanity, Cat Cora.   “We appreciate the wonderful generosity of Chefs for Humanity in mobilizing their network to help us save lives,” says Nan Dale, Executive Director of Action Against Hunger.  “We know this partnership will help focus attention on the shameful reality that millions die every year for the simple want of food and clean water.”

 

<p>The Restaurants Against Hunger campaign runs from April 10 through May 9, 2007 with more than 250 restaurants participating.   90% of all funds raised will combat malnutrition and support lifesaving food and clean water assistance.  On April 12, 2007, a Restaurants Against Hunger Celebrity Kick-off Gala takes place in New York City.  The gala includes food from some of New York’s finest restaurants, live music and a live auction. Chefs for Humanity Chef Council including Cat Cora, Ming Tsai, Bobby Flay, Gale Gand, Rick Bayless, Katie Lee Joel is participating along with other celebrity chef friends. More exciting details on this event and the overall 2007 Hunger Awareness Campaign and media events will be released separately.
