<p>WASHINGTON - February 13 - Paul Helmke, President
of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, released the following
statement on the shootings Monday night in Philadelphia and Salt Lake City:
   <p> "Once again today, we are all struggling with reports about terrible
losses of lives to gun violence. What a disturbed teenager in Utah and a
tormented businessman in Pennsylvania have in common is that they had
access to guns. Horrific mass killings cannot be committed with knives or
baseball bats or bare fists. Weak gun laws have led to a glut of weapons on
the streets. And as a result, bitter human frustrations lead to gun
violence. Anger leads to killings. When will our Nation wake up and
confront the tragic reality that we make it far too easy for dangerous
people to have access to guns?
  <p>  "We join with our Brady members and Million Mom March Chapters in Utah
and Pennsylvania and across America in offering our heartfelt condolences
to the families of those that have been lost. We urge lawmakers who have
enabled angry men to get assault rifles and teenagers to get other long
guns to stand up to the gun pushers and do something to curb the flow of
weapons through our communities. We may never know what, if anything, could
have prevented these terrible shootings, but we can and must bring sanity
to our Nation's gun policies to ensure that other families do not suffer
from such tragedies."<!-- #EndEditable -->
