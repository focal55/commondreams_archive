<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 19 --Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) executive director Melanie Sloan re-issued the following statement in response to the final Ethics Task Force proposal:
<p></p>
“Despite scandal after scandal and a new Congress that promised to change Capitol Hill’s “culture of corruption,” it appears that the months wasted haggling over new ethics rules have been all for naught. Given that the new Office of Congressional Ethics will not accept complaints from outsiders nor have subpoena power, in effect, the song remains the same. All we have here is another layer of bureaucracy added to prevent members from being held accountable for their unethical activities.”
<p></p>
<i>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is a non-profit legal watchdog group dedicated to holding public officials accountable for their actions.
