<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 17 - Members of MoveOn will
hold more than 130 "counter-filibusters" Tuesday evening in cities and
districts across the country as Republican Senators join a "filibuster" to
block a vote on ending the Iraq war. They will call on their Senators to
end their participation in the filibuster, which blocks the Senate from
passing a timetable for the safe and secure exit of U.S. troops from Iraq.
   <P></P> MoveOn members will read letters from Iraq war veterans and their
families that call on Congress to bring the troops home soon. "We're
gathering to ask these Senators to stop playing political games and vote to
bring our troops home safely, securely, and soon," said Eli Pariser,
Executive Director, MoveOn.org Political Action.
     <P></P> A majority of U.S. Senators are on record in support of legislation
that would require President Bush to begin bringing troops home within the
next 120 days and complete the task by April 2008. They will not be able to
vote on such a measure if a small group of Republican senators continue to
block progress on the most important issue facing the country. Senate rules
require 60 (out of 100) votes to end debate so Senators can vote on a bill.
     <P></P> The pending Senate measure is an amendment to the Defense Authorization
bill offered by Democratic Senators Carl Levin (MI), chair of the Armed
Services Committee, and Jack Reed (RI), a former U.S. Army Ranger. It is
co- sponsored by three Republican Senators -- Olympia Snowe (ME), Chuck
Hagel (NE), and Gordon Smith (OR).
     <P></P> WHO:    MoveOn members and other local residents along with local veterans
            and military families

     <P></P> WHAT:   A "counter-filibuster" directed at Senate Republicans, demanding
            that they stop blocking a vote for a timetable to end the Iraq
            War.

     <P></P> WHERE:  DC Event: Upper Senate Park, First St. &amp; Delaware Ave. NW

            <P></P>  MN Event: Senator Norm Coleman's Mankato Office,
            12 Civic Center Plaza, Suite 2167, Mankato, MN 56001
