<p>WASHINGTON - May 14 - <i>Media Matters for America</i> today
released "<a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/SundayShowDiversity">Sunday
Shutout: The Lack of Gender &amp; Ethnic Diversity on the Sunday Morning Talk
Shows</a>," a special report documenting the overwhelming lack of gender
and racial/ethnic diversity on the influential, agenda-setting Sunday morning
network political talk shows.</p>

<p>"On the whole, our report demonstrates the
all-important Sunday shows are seriously lacking a meaningful presence of women
and people of color. For too long, these voices have been relegated to the back
of network newsrooms," said David Brock, President and CEO of <i>Media Matters</i>. "Women and people of color add perspective, depth, and
value to the quality of our public discourse, whatever the issue at hand. For
these influential broadcasts to ignore these voices is to deny the American
people the genuine and representative debate they deserve on issues of the day.
If we've learned anything in the wake of the Imus controversy, it is that
the networks have the power to make positive, inclusive change -- change that
is severely needed."</p>

<p>The report analyzed
ABC's <i>This Week</i>, CBS'
<i>Face the Nation</i>, NBC's <i>Meet the Press</i>, and Fox Broadcasting
Co.'s <i>Fox News Sunday</i>, classifying each of the more than 2,000
guests in 2005 and 2006 by gender and by ethnicity/race. It follows a report
released last week titled "<a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/CableDiversity">Locked Out: The Lack of
Gender &amp; Ethnic Diversity on Cable News Continues</a>," which documented
the continued lack of gender and racial/ethnic diversity on the major
prime-time cable news shows.</p>

<p><b>Key
Findings:</b> </p>



<ul style="margin-top: 0in;"><li class="MsoNormal">NBC's <i>Meet the Press</i>, ABC's <i>This Week</i>, CBS' <i>Face the Nation</i>, and Fox Broadcasting
     Co.'s <i>Fox News Sunday</i>
     feature guest lists that are overwhelmingly white and male. </li></ul>


<ul style="margin-top: 0in;"><li class="MsoNormal">On average, men
     outnumber women on <i>Meet the Press</i>,
     <i>This Week</i>, <i>Face the Nation</i>, and <i>Fox News Sunday</i> by a 4-to-1 ratio. </li></ul>



<ul style="margin-top: 0in;"><li class="MsoNormal">On average, there
     were nearly seven white guests for every guest of any other
     race/ethnicity. On <i>Meet the Press</i>

     and <i>Face the Nation</i>, there
     were nearly nine white guests for every guest of another race/ethnicity. </li></ul>



<ul style="margin-top: 0in;"><li class="MsoNormal">The top-rated Sunday
     program -- <i>Meet the Press</i> --
     shows the least diversity of all. The NBC program is the most male and
     nearly the most white (edged out by <i>Face
     the Nation</i> by 1 percentage point.) </li></ul>

<p><i><b>More from Media Matters About the Sunday Shows</b></i></p>

<p><i>In March, Media Matters released "<a href="http://www.sundayshowreport.com/" target="_new">If It's Sunday, It's Still Conservative</a>," a report
documenting the continued dominance of Republican and conservative voices on
the network Sunday morning talk shows -- ABC's This Week, CBS' Face
the Nation, NBC's Meet the
Press, and Fox Broadcasting Co.'s Fox News Sunday. The report classified each of the more than
2,000 guests in 2005 and 2006 as well as guests since the 2006 midterm
elections by party and/or ideology. It followed on a report from 2006, "If It's Sunday,
It's Conservative," which analyzed more than 7,000 guests on
the Sunday shows during the Clinton and Bush presidencies and found a
Republican or conservative tilt during both administrations. Visit <a href="http://www.sundayshowreport.com/" target="_new">http://www.SundayShowReport.com</a> for
