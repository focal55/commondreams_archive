<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 1 - On behalf of Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Members, we pledge our support for comprehensive immigration reform and, based on the call of the American people, we urge that the Congress not delay meeting this responsibility. The Senate is expected to complete its debate on comprehensive immigration reform once they return from recess, and we encourage the Senators to pass legislation for the House to consider no later than July. 

<P></P>As the legislative process continues, we ask that all Members of the 110th Congress embrace the following fundamental principles to improve our nation’s immigration laws:

<P></P>•	Protecting family reunification; 
<P></P>•	Ensuring that we do not create a permanent underclass;
<P></P>•	Strengthening due process; and
<P></P>•	Creating a responsible and just route to earned legalization.

<P></P>“It is crucial that Congress show leadership to approve comprehensive
immigration reform,” stressed U.S. Representative Hilda Solis (CA-32), Co-Chair of the CPC’s Immigration Task Force. “We need to move fast to approve a bill that would overhaul our broken immigration system in a way that better protects and enforces our borders, respects the family unit, and provides a pathway to citizenship.  It is critical that any legislation keeps families united.  Eliminating family preferences and creating a point system to supposedly attract the best and the brightest to the United States at the expense of family immigration is unacceptable.  We will continue to urge our colleagues in the House and Senate to listen to the message which reverberated across the country and provide a real solution for our broken immigration system.”

<P></P>“We need to ensure reform is compassionate, fair and upholds our values,” said U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva (AZ-07), Co-Chair of the CPC’s Immigration Task Force. “The Senate compromise in its current form is unacceptable.  The House has a responsibility to raise the bar.  We cannot abandon our values of family and justice and this country’s rich history of immigration. The Congressional Progressive Caucus looks forward to pushing forward a House bill that addresses our broken immigration system and deals with the realities of our country.”

"While encouraged that the debate surrounding immigration reform has not come to a halt, I have many concerns about the deal made in the Senate," said U.S. Representative Mike Honda (CA-15), a member of the CPC’s Immigration Task Force. "The proposal would undermine this nation’s long tradition of family-based immigration by eliminating several family-based categories. The proposed point system would fail to adequately account for the economic contributions made by family members, who rely on one another to start and run businesses, purchase homes, and send 



			

children to college. They provide care for young children, the sick, and elderly. In addition, a temporary worker program with no path to permanent residency would create an underclass of workers, and could lead to lower wages for all workers. Finally, the border security and enforcement provisions must contain adequate due 
process protections. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that a humane and workable piece of legislation is passed."

<P></P>“The bill currently under consideration in the Senate fails to address the fundamental flaws in our immigration system and will potentially make matters worse by eliminating the emphasis on family reunification and creating a vulnerable class of guest workers,” said U.S. Representative Barbara Lee (CA-09), CPC Co-Chair.  “I look forward to working with my colleagues in the CPC to promote a truly representative House bill that includes family reunification, earned legalization, and a path to citizenship.”

<P></P>“Congress can no longer ignore the urgent need for reform of our nation’s immigration laws,” underscored U.S. Representative Lynn Woolsey (CA-06) , CPC Co-Chair. “We need orderly, legal avenues for immigration, pathways to citizenship, a better approach to knowing who is coming in and out of our country, serious sanctions on employers who hire undocumented workers, and worker protections and an education system that helps bring all families into our communities.”
