<p>WASHINGTON - January 9 - As violent attacks increase 
across Darfur, and as the humanitarian crisis that forms part of the 
genocide continues to escalate, Africa Action today condemned the lack 
of progress by the international community in realizing the necessary 
United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force to protect the people of Darfur.

<p>Africa Action welcomed the stated commitment of new UN Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-Moon to prioritizing Darfur, and noted new diplomatic overtures 
on the part of the U.S., aimed at advancing new action on this crisis. 
However, the organization emphasized the urgency of the situation on the 
ground and the ongoing deadlock between the Sudanese government and the 
international community on the size and composition of a peacekeeping 
force. Africa Action continues to call for the rapid deployment of a 
robust UN peacekeeping force, with a Chapter VII mandate, to stop the 
ongoing genocide in Darfur.

<p>Nii Akuetteh, Executive Director of Africa Action, said today, "Despite 
hopeful media reports, there has been no diplomatic breakthrough on 
Darfur and the death toll is continuing to mount. The international 
community has capitulated to Khartoum's opposition to a UN force, and 
the people of Darfur have been abandoned to the growing violence on the 
ground. The UN Security Council must stand up to the Sudanese government 
NOW, and pursue the deployment of the robust UN peacekeeping force 
authorized by Resolution 1706 last August."

<p>As U.S. Special Envoy Andrew Natsios travels to China this week to 
discuss the Darfur crisis, Africa Action's new report released last 
month, entitled "Leveraging New International Action on Darfur", lays 
out how the U.S. can and must engage China and other key international 
actors in breaking the current deadlock and achieving the necessary UN 
peacekeeping force for Darfur. The report is available here: 
<a href="http://www.africaaction.org/resources/page.php?op=read&documentid=2235&type=6&issues=1024/">http://www.africaaction.org/resources/page.php?op=read&documentid=2235&type=6&issues=1024/</a><p>Ann-Louise Colgan, Director of Policy Analysis & Communications at 
Africa Action, said today, "New U.S. diplomatic initiatives on Darfur 
must use all available leverage and political capital to advance the 
goal of protecting civilians on the ground. As Natsios visits China this 
week, he must use Washington's close economic and political ties with 
Beijing to enlist Chinese engagement in challenging Khartoum's 
obstructionism on Darfur. Until the U.S. makes Darfur a real priority in 
its foreign relations, it cannot claim to be doing everything possible 
to stop the genocide."

<p>Africa Action notes that China has made clear that it supports a UN 
peacekeeping force for Darfur, but that Khartoum's consent must be 
achieved first. Now, the U.S. must work to actively engage the Chinese 
government in gaining this consent and removing the final obstacles to 
the necessary peacekeeping force for Darfur.

<p>In addition, Africa Action urges the Bush Administration to quickly 
nominate a strong candidate to succeed John Bolton as U.S. Ambassador to 
the UN, and calls on Congress to ensure that the confirmation process 
affirms the centrality of the Darfur crisis to the U.S. agenda at the UN.

<p>Africa Action is working with the Genocide Intervention Network to 
encourage individuals and community groups across the U.S. to hold 
Sprints for Darfur in the coming weeks, to raise awareness, resources 
and political pressure to protect the people of Darfur and stop the 
genocide. For more information on these innovative actions, see
