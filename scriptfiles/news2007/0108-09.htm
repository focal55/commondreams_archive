<p>NEW YORK - January 8 - Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) activists and other members of the Save Darfur Coalition will hold a vigil outside the White House on Tuesday, January 9th calling for the Bush Administration to act on Darfur. The group will present tens of thousands of petitions from Americans concerned about Darfur and call for the Bush Administration to disclose its "Plan B" for the implementation of an expanded international peacekeeping force. 

<p>Andrew Natsios, President Bush's special envoy for Darfur, said on November 20th that the U.S. would not wait indefinitely for Sudan to agree to an expanded peacekeeping force. Natsios said to reporters that on January 1, 2007, "either we see a change or we go to Plan B." 

<p>"The January 1st deadline has come and gone -- it's time for the White House to announce its 'Plan B' on Darfur," said Larry Cox, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA. "Sudan has refused again and again to allow an expanded peacekeeping force to protect civilians, and the world has not held that government accountable." 

<p>Amnesty International has invited Bobby Pittman, Senior Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, to accept the petitions at the North Gate of the White House. 


<p>WHO:<b> Lynn Fredriksson, AIUSA Advocacy Director for Africa 
Approximately 200 Amnesty International activists and Save Darfur Coalition partners </b>
<p>WHAT:<b> Vigil for Darfur; Presentation of petitions to the White House </b>
