<p>  WASHINGTON, DC - September 27 –With Congress poised to approve legislation this week that would provide health coverage to nearly 10 million children, leaders of the nation’s largest healthcare union today urge President Bush to reconsider his pledge to veto the bill.
<p></p>
By the end of this week, Congress is expected to pass legislation that builds upon the successful State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), extending health coverage to nearly 10 million children whose families can’t afford private insurance.  Once approved, the bill will land on the desk of President Bush, who has promised to veto it.
<p></p>
“President Bush has a choice to make,” said Dennis Rivera, chair of SEIU Healthcare.  “Either he believes children should have healthcare or he doesn’t.  Either he believes we are a compassionate, caring society or he doesn't.  Either he respects the members of our Congress and their leadership, or he doesn't.  If he vetoes this bill, he is telling millions of kids that he simply does not care about them.”

SEIU Members, Kids to Deliver Millions of Petitions to White House at Press Conference, Rally on Monday, October 1
<p></p>
On Monday, October 1, dozens of children will help deliver mail bags full of petitions signed by people across the country urging the President to get out of the way of healthcare for kids.  Details on this event will be released Friday.
<p></p>
The Care for Kids petition drive was co-sponsored by Americans United for Change, Campaign for America’s Future, Change America Now, Coalition on Human Needs, Families USA, Moveon.org, the National Education Association, True Majority, and USAction.
