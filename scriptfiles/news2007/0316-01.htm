<p>WASHINGTON - March 16  -  Water Advocates will assemble key leaders working to prevent sickness and death related to unsafe drinking water in developing countries. Speakers will highlight ground-breaking initiatives that demonstrate how US support for water and sanitation—and the call for even greater action—is growing.

 

<p>Safe drinking water and sanitation are key to global public health, yet across the world 1.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, and 2.6 billion—more than one-third of the earth’s population—lack adequate sanitation. Combined, these two problems kill between two and five million people a year—or a population the size of the city of Los Angeles—and sicken billions more.  Panelists will discuss how individuals from all walks of life are expanding efforts to address this challenge.

 

<p>"Diseases spawned by unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation can be prevented. The world knows how to do it. What is lacking is funding and political will. Clean drinking water and basic sanitation underlie every aspect of development—from good health and education to economic growth and environmental sustainability." said David Douglas, President of Water Advocates.
