<p>WASHINGTON - January 5 - The House took a major step 
forward today in adopting a strong package of new ethics rules to govern 


the conduct of Members and staff.
<p>Our organizations applaud 
Speaker Pelosi for the leadership she provided in proposing strong 
ethics reforms and we applaud Representatives for voting for these 
important ethics rules reforms.</p>

<p>We strongly urge Senators to 
adopt similar ethics rules reforms dealing with new restrictions on 
travel, gifts, meals, entertainment and corporate planes provided for 
Senators and staff, when the Senate considers ethics and lobbying reform 


next week.</p>

<p>The House action today 
represents the first phase of the House ethics and lobbying reform 
efforts. Lobbying reform legislation is expected to be considered by the 


House in February and reform of the ethics enforcement process will be 
considered in March.</p>

<p>Our organizations believe it is 


essential to establish a new professional, nonpartisan enforcement 
entity to help enforce the House ethics rules and that such an 
enforcement entity is a lynchpin for all the other ethics 
reforms.</p>

<p>We plan on conducting a major 
effort in support of a new ethics enforcement entity for the House, and 
for the Senate as well. We also will be conducting a similar effort in 
support of strong new lobbying reform laws.</p>
