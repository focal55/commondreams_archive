<p>NEW YORK - AUGUST 1 - Amnesty International today welcomed the unanimous U.N. Security Council vote to send a strengthened African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force to Darfur but called for urgent deployment, effective resources to support the deployment and the full support of the Sudanese government.
<P></P>
"The Security Council gives us new reason to hope that the United Nations will finally move effectively to protect the people of Darfur," said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA. "But we are mindful that hundreds of thousands of Darfuris have died and over a million people have been driven from their homes while the world did little to stop the killing. While we welcome the passage of Resolution 1769, the truth is that Darfur can wait no longer for help. The region desperately needs a protective force now to prevent more killings."
<P></P>
"World leaders must guard against efforts by Sudan to obstruct the peacekeeping force from taking effect," Cox said. "And they must give us assurances that the force will be established and on the ground as swiftly as possible. To do otherwise, will only sentence many more Darfuris to the horrors we have witnessed for four years now."
<P></P>
While passage of the resolution gives some long awaited hope to millions of Darfuris, it is now essential that U.N. member states provide the resources necessary to swiftly deploy an effective force with a strong human rights component, Amnesty International said. This must include the capacity and authority to monitor and investigate human rights violations, including all cases of rape and other forms of sexual violence, and to report publicly on all human rights abuses.
<P></P>
Deployed in a region awash with arms, the United Nations must also ensure the forces can oversee the disarmament and demobilization of government-supported Janjawid militia. The new resolution only allows the force to monitor "whether any arms or related material are present in Darfur" and urgently needs to be strengthened.
<P></P>
Amnesty International also urges the U.N. Security Council to ensure that the current arms embargo is effectively enforced.
<P></P>
"Given the Sudanese government's past record of obstructing such deployments, we urge the government to facilitate the rapid deployment of the new force," said Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan. "The people of Darfur have been offered too many words and too many resolutions. Now is the time for effective action."
