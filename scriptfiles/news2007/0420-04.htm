<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp;– The American Civil Liberties Union today 
expressed its strong support for the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) introduced by 
Senator Barbara Boxer (D – CA) and Representative Jerrold Nadler (D – NY). This 
legislation would preserve women’s health and reproductive rights by protecting 
their right to privacy and ability to make their own reproductive choices.</p>
<p>This new legislation is especially important in light of 
yesterday’s Supreme Court decision upholding a federal ban on certain abortion 
procedures over the strong objections of the medical community, including the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization 
representing 90 percent of the country’s OB-GYNs.</p>

<p>“This latest attack on women’s reproductive health shows once 
again the pressing need for legislation keeping personal medical decisions in 
the hands of doctors and their patients,” said Caroline Fredrickson, director of 
the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. “Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling, we 
still believe that doctors, not politicians, are most qualified to determine the 
safest course of treatment for their patients. The Freedom of Choice Act will 
protect women’s relationships with their doctors from political intrusion.”</p>
<p>The Freedom of Choice Act would restore critical protections 
for women’s health, a core principle of Roe v. Wade that was undercut by 
yesterday’s Supreme Court ruling. It would protect the right of women, in 
conjunction with their doctors, to make personal medical decisions and prohibit 
the government interfering in those decisions.</p>
<p>Said Fredrickson, “At a time when the core protections of 
Roe v. Wade are under attack, FOCA is essential to guarantee reproductive 
freedom in federal law for future generations of American women. The ACLU 
strongly supports this important legislation and urges Congress to lend the bill 
its support.”
