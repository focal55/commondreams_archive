<p>WASHINGTON - September 4 - As the District of Columbia today filed its petition asking the United States Supreme Court to review a Court of Appeals ruling striking down the District's strict handgun law, the Brady Center released the latest installment in its continuing on-line critique of the ruling.</p>
<p align="left">The Center's "rolling critique," <em>Second Amendment Fantasy:  The D.C. Circuit's Opinion in the Parker Case</em>, is a comprehensive discussion, by Brady Center lawyers, of the landmark 2-1 Second Amendment ruling in Parker v. District of Columbia, handed down on March 9 of this year, in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit became the first federal appeals court in history to strike down a gun law as a violation of the Second Amendment.  The Brady on-line critique, in its entirety, is available at <a href="http://www.gunlawsuits.org/defend/second/fantasy/pdf/parker-opinion-critique4.pdf" target="_blank">www.gunlawsuits.org</a>.</p>
<p align="left">The new installment, entitled <em>Parker and "The People":  How the Parker Court Obscured the Real Issue in the Second Amendment Debate</em>, addresses in detail the D.C. Circuit's argument that the Framers' inclusion of the phrase "the people" in the Second Amendment itself establishes that the right "to keep and bear Arms" extends to private purposes such as hunting and self-defense and is not confined to service in a "well regulated Militia."</p>

<p align="left">The Brady Center discussion exposes this argument as an effort by the <em>Parker</em> majority to obscure the real issue in the Second Amendment debate:  What is the nature and scope of the right granted "the people" in the Second Amendment?  As argued throughout <em>Second Amendment Fantasy</em>, there is only one answer to that question that accounts for all the words of the Second Amendment and accurately reflects its history:  the Amendment guarantees to the people the right to keep and bear arms only in a well regulated militia.</p>
<p align="left">The Supreme Court is expected to decide whether to take review of the Court of Appeals ruling in October.  Now that the case is before the Supreme Court, it is captioned <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>.</p>
<p align="left">Previous installments of Second Amendment Fantasy included Mangling Miller (about the Parker court's disregard for binding Supreme Court precedent), Decision by Eraser (showing how the court's opinion effectively "erased" the first thirteen words of the Second Amendment), and <em>Militia Madness</em> (on how the court distorted the nature of the "well regulated Militia" referenced in the Amendment's text).</p><p align="center"># # #</p>

<p style="font-style: oblique;" align="left">As the nation's largest national, non-partisan, grassroots organizations leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence is dedicated to creating an America free from gun violence, where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in their communities.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
