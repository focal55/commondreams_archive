<p>WASHINGTON - August 31 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Inc., applauds today’s decision by an Iowa trial court that the state’s constitution requires extending the freedom to marry to same-sex couples. The case was filed in December 2005 by Lambda Legal on behalf of six same-sex couples and their families who had sought, and were denied, marriage licenses in Iowa.</p>

<p>The case will ultimately be decided by the Iowa Supreme Court. If that court upholds today’s decision, Iowa will join Massachusetts in extending full marriage equality to same-sex couples. Six additional states (California, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon and Vermont) provide broad family recognition to same-sex couples through civil unions or domestic partnerships.<br>

<p align="center"><strong>Statement by Rea Carey, Deputy Executive Director<br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Inc.</strong></p>

<p>“This is truly a watershed moment for equality in the American heartland. We thank the plaintiffs for their courage and we applaud the outstanding work of our colleagues at Lambda Legal in today’s victory.”</p>

<p><strong>About the Task Force, Inc., work in Iowa:</strong></p>

<p>This past spring, the Task Force, Inc., was proud to partner with Equality Iowa (now One Iowa), the statewide LGBT rights group, and the Iowa Safe Schools Task Force, to pass historic transgender-inclusive nondiscrimination and anti-bullying laws. The Task Force applauds Equality Iowa, One Iowa, the Interfaith Alliance, the Iowa Safe Schools Task Force and all others who have helped to create a climate in Iowa that would enable this victory today.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="1"><i>The mission of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is to build the grassroots power of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. We do this by training activists, equipping state and local organizations with the skills needed to organize broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation, and building the organizational capacity of our movement. Our Policy Institute, the movement’s premier think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality and to counter right-wing lies. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a nation that respects the diversity of human expression and identity and creates opportunity for all. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Cambridge.</p>
