<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 21 - Last week, Senate leaders
unveiled the key components of an agreement on a comprehensive immigration
reform measure that the full U.S. Senate is expected to debate this week.
The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) is
concerned that the current agreement creates an unfair and unworkable path
to legalization as well as a guestworker program that exploits immigrant
workers and adversely affects the wages and workplace conditions for U.S.
workers.
<P></P> "Given that the American public has waited long enough for our broken
immigration system to be fixed, we had higher expectations that a workable
bi- partisan solution would be reached. Unfortunately, the Senate has
conceded too much on families, workers, and communities," said ACORN
President Maude Hurd.
   <P></P> The Senate has announced that it will vote to proceed to the bill today
(Monday) at 5:30 pm EDT and will likely spend the next few days debating
amendments to improve or further worsen the bill.
    <P></P>ACORN, along with other organizations, is calling on the Senate to fix
the underlying agreement by approving amendments that adhere to the
principles of real comprehensive immigration reform. Specifically, the
Senate should act to provide the following:
   <P></P> -- A fair and workable path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants
       currently living in the U.S. by eliminating burdensome provisions, such
       as requiring heads of households to return to their country of origin
       for processing.
    <P></P>-- Protections for all workers, both native and foreign-born, by rejecting
       any guestworker program that does not provide a means for workers to
       become permanent residents and enjoy full wage and labor protections.
   <P></P> -- A means for families to stay together by rejecting a point system that
       destroys family-based immigration.
   <P></P> "If the Senate fails to improve this starter bill, ACORN, as an
organization that represents both low-wage workers and immigrant families,
will have no choice but to strongly oppose this bill," added Hurd.
   <P></P> ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) is the
nation's largest community organization of low- and moderate-income
families, with over 350,000 member families organized into 800 neighborhood
chapters in 103 cities across the country. (ACORN -- an acronym for
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- should be used on
first reference.) Learn more at <a href="http://www.acorn.org" target="_new">http://www.acorn.org</a> .
