<p>CHARLOTTETOWN, Canada -- Thousands of harp seal
pups are assumed dead in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence due to the lack of
ice floes, which mother seals require to give birth and nurse their pups
successfully. Experts with IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare -
<a href="http://www.ifaw.org" target="_new">http://www.ifaw.org</a>) have been carrying out daily surveillance flights over the
region. They report that the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which is the annual
birthing ground of hundreds of thousands of harp seals, is essentially
devoid of both ice and seals.
    <p>"The conditions this year are disastrous. I've surveyed this region for
six years and I haven't seen anything like this." said Sheryl Fink, a
senior researcher with IFAW. "There is wide open water and almost no seals.
I only saw a handful of adult harp seals and even fewer pups, where
normally we should be seeing thousands and thousands of seals."
    <p>The ice conditions this year are among the worst on record. Scientists
have recorded below average ice conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
off Newfoundland for the past nine out of 11 years. In 2002, 75% of harp
seal pups born in the Gulf died due to lack of ice before the hunt even
began. This year, the ice conditions appear to be even worse than in 2002
and scientists with IFAW are concerned that pup mortality will be extremely
high.
    <p>"It's highly likely that this year we could have close to 100% pup
mortality in the Gulf of St. Lawrence due to the poor ice conditions caused
by rising temperatures," said Dr. David Lavigne, IFAW's science advisor,
who recently co-authored a report on the impacts of global warming on harp
seals.
    <p>Experts with Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), which
monitors the harp seal population and sets targets for annual commercial
seal hunt in Canada, have also acknowledged the increase in seal pup
mortality this year. It is cited as one reason why the Canadian government
has yet to announce the total allowable catch (TAC) or official start date
of the this year's hunt, which is due to begin any day.
    <p>"It would be reckless for the government to allow the hunt to proceed
this year, given the high pup mortality that has apparently occurred," said
Fink. "We may not be able to save these seals from the effects of global
warming, but the Canadian government can save the survivors from being
hunted. I can only hope that they will do the right thing and cancel the
hunt."
    <p>The Canadian government has permitted nearly one million seals to be
killed in the past three years. The government quotas have continually
exceeded the number of seals that can be safely removed without causing the
population to decline. Last year, the TAC was set at 335,000 seals (far
above the estimated sustainable level of 250,000) and the total number of
seals reported killed was over 354,000 -- exceeding the legal limit by
19,000 animals. Of the 354,000 seals killed last year, 98% were under three
months of age.
