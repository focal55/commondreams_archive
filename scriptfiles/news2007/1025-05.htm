<br>• Jacqui Deveneau, Maine Green Independent Party: "Tens of billions of dollars continue to be taken from the American tax payers towards a campaign that is claiming the lives of nearly 4,000 service people and countless Iraqis. &nbsp;Our communities consequentially are being neglected and are suffering from lack of health care, education, and -- in the Gulf Coast region -- disaster relief services."<br><br>• Paul "zool" Zulkowitz, Green Party of New York, member of the Green Party's Peace Action Committee (GPAX): "The Green Party has supported the work of Iraq Veterans Against War &nbsp;from its inception. &nbsp;The vets bring great credibility and 'militancy' to our antiwar movement. &nbsp;Helping individual Iraqis get medical attention makes antiwar work more personal, lessens the frustration of lobbying a deaf White House and dumb Congress. &nbsp;Furthermore, vets are inspiring peace-loving Americans everywhere to participate in the antiwar movement."<br><br>• Maryrose Asher, Secretary, Green Party of Washington State: "Our job is to build a principled mass anti-war movement that demands that the troops come home now. &nbsp;The Seattle Northwest Regional Event is sponsored by the End of War Coalition, of which the Green Party of Washington State is a participant. &nbsp;We encourage everyone who can to take part in this national day of protest."<br><br><!-- #EndEditable -->
