<p>NEW YORK - November 28 - This Friday, attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union will provide a background briefing about three major events occurring on Wednesday, December 5 regarding the illegal detention and torture of detainees in U.S. custody:
<p></p>
    <b>* </b>An argument before the United States Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush regarding the habeas corpus rights of Guantánamo detainees. The case will have major implications for the rights of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas to challenge their detention in the civilian court system. The ACLU has filed a “friend of the court” brief in this case.
<p></p>
    <b>* </b>The military commissions proceeding of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, alleged to be Osama bin Laden’s driver and charged with conspiracy and providing terrorism support. It was in Hamdan’s case that the U.S. Supreme Court held in 2006 that the then-existing military commissions system violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions. In response, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act under which the Pentagon is now seeking to prosecute Hamdan. The case was initially thrown out in June when the military judge found the government failed to show Hamdan was an “unlawful enemy combatant” as the law required. The judge has now allowed the government to present evidence of such alleged status. The ACLU will be at Guantánamo to monitor the Hamdan proceeding.
<p></p>
    <b>*</b> A federal court hearing on the ACLU’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to obtain documents from the government regarding treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. The ACLU and other groups are requesting the release of three secret memos issued by the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel, two of which were disclosed by the New York Times in October, the third of which the ACLU became aware in legal papers recently filed by the government. The memos relate to harsh interrogation methods authorized for CIA use.
<p></p>
On the teleconference, ACLU attorneys who are experts on these issues will describe the significance of each event and provide context about how they all relate to one another.
<p></p>
