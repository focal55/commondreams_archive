WASHINGTON -- On Tuesday, April 10th,
MoveOn.org Political Action and co-sponsors SEIU and Campaign for America's
Future will hold a first-of-its-kind online candidate forum, a "Virtual
Town Hall." The presidential hopefuls will discuss their positions on Iraq
and respond to questions from MoveOn members.
    <P></P>Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Barack Obama,
Dennis Kucinich, Joe Biden and Bill Richardson will participate in the
first of three Virtual Town Halls. Candidates were invited if at least 10
percent of surveyed MoveOn members said they would like to hear what he or
she has to say. Several Republican candidates were also invited to
participate but declined to take part in this discussion on Iraq.
    <P></P>MoveOn members submitted more than 6,800 potential questions and then
more than 600,000 votes were cast to determine the top questions to be
asked of the seven presidential candidates.
    <P></P>"This event will give real people a chance to ask presidential
candidates tough questions about Iraq, the most important issue of our
time," said Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org Political Action's Executive Director.
"The internet is clearly changing the way campaigns are run," Pariser
concluded.
    <P></P>Many of MoveOn's 3.2 million members are expected to gather in more
than 950 homes across the country to listen to the discussion. In the 2006
midterm election MoveOn members contributed $27 million, made 7 million
get-out-the- vote phone calls, organized 7,500 house parties and held 6,000
in-district campaign events. Overall, MoveOn's membership grew by 450,000.
    <P></P>After the town hall event, members will be surveyed about which
candidates' positions they prefer. Members will then be encouraged to sign
up for candidates' email lists and to contribute to their campaigns. The
survey results will be released on Thursday, April 12th.
    <P></P>Air America will broadcast the town hall in Los Angeles, New York and
on their satellite radio station. The discussion will air on the network of
Air America affiliates three times over the course of that week.
    <P></P>The timeline for the first Virtual Town Hall is as follows:

    <P></P>March 28th: Email sent out to MoveOn members announcing event and question
                submission instructions
    <P></P>April 10th: Virtual Town Hall takes place at 7 p.m. EST in homes across
                the country
    <P></P>April 10th: Support survey begins immediately following town hall; results
                collected until midnight PST April 11th.
    <P></P>April 12th: Results of support survey announced (*does not constitute an
                endorsement from MoveOn.org Political Action).
