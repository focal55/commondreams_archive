NATIONAL IMMIGRANT SOLIDARITY NETWORK:<br>National Immigrant Solidarity Network 
(NISN) was formed November 2003. Dozen national grassroots &amp; community 
groups were agreed to form a broad based immigrant support coalition, aim to 
mobilize community forces to work with different national immigrants and civil 
rights organizations and in solidarity with their campaigns. NISN is the proud 
member organizations and leadership of United for Peace &amp; Justice and Latin 
American Solidarity Coalition.<br><br>The destiny of 12 millions or more 
undocumented immigrants is one of the critical human rights issues in the U.S., 
we need a comprehensive immigration reform bill that will guarantee path to the 
citizenship with dignity. NISN supports the anti-globalization &amp; peace 
movements to link global campaigns with local justice issues, and to supports 
community struggles where they lives. THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY.<br></p>
