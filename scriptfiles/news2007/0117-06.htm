<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - Following news 
of recent air strikes targeting al-Qaeda in Somalia, the Campaign for Innocent 
Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today called on U.S. and Ethiopian air forces to 
exercise caution and to adequately assess potential harm to civilians before 
launching air strikes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The International Herald Tribune yesterday 
reported fear and claims of civilian deaths among nomads in southern Somalia 
following US and Ethiopian air raids in early January. CIVIC cautioned that the 
use of air power carries with it a high risk of civilian casualties, despite the 
use of precision weapons.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;We have seen the human cost of fighting 
insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq, with far too many innocent lives lost,&#8221; said 
Sarah Holewinski, executive director of CIVIC. &nbsp;&#8220;Somali civilians should 
not have to suffer the same fate.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Under the law of armed 
conflict, military operations must use all feasible means to minimize loss of 
civilian life and property, and attacks must be withheld if expected to cause 
excessive civilian loss in comparison to a concrete military goal. &nbsp;&#8220;Air 
power is notoriously indiscriminate. The US military and their Ethiopian and 
Somali counterparts should take all precautions to distinguish between civilians 
and combatants,&#8221; said Holewinski. &nbsp;CIVIC urged military planners in Somalia 
to adequately assess the risk to civilians before launching air attacks and to 
evaluate their success following the attack. &nbsp;That assessment includes 
keeping a full count of civilians harmed. Currently, the U.S. does not keep an 
official count of civilian casualties in Somalia.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>CIVIC is a 
Washington-based organization founded by the late Marla Ruzicka, a passionate 
humanitarian killed by a suicide bomb in Baghdad while advocating for war 
victims in Iraq. CIVIC believes that civilians injured and the families of those 
killed should be recognized and aided by the governments involved, and is 
working toward smart, compassionate policies for civilians caught in the 
crossfire of conflict.<!-- #EndEditable -->
