<p>MARYLAND &mdash; JULY 18&mdash; Today, Senator Susan Collins found yet another way to maintain her voting support for President Bush's Iraq policy while attempting to give Mainers the opposite impression. She supported a measure to allow a vote on legislation which would set a timetable for the safe and secure exit of U.S. troops but declared her opposition to the bill itself.

 

<P></P>Last night, Republican Senators successfully employed a filibuster to block a vote for the Levin (D-MI)/Reed (D-RI) amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that mandates the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq by the end of April, 2008.  Democratic Senators, joined by three Republican colleagues (Senators Hagel, Snowe, and Smith) who support an exit timetable, constitute a 53-46 majority. Senate rules, however, require 60 votes to end debate so that a vote on the amendment can occur. With only four Republican Senators joining their effort to close debate, Democratic Senators fell short.

 

<P></P>"I don't think anyone in Maine was fooled by Senator Collins' latest vote. Grassroots pressure continues to build and the Senator is obviously feeling it. Senator Snowe has already changed her vote but her colleague continues to insist on representing the views of the President and against the views of most Mainers," said former Maine Congressman Tom Andrews, national director of the Win Without War coalition.
