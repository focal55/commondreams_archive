<p>  WASHINGTON - September 25 -Amnesty International issued the following statement in response to President Bush's speech to the United Nations today on human rights around the globe:
<P></P>
The president made a strong statement that placed human rights at the center of his concern.  But actions speak louder than words.  The president's  commitment to human rights would carry greater authority and credibility if the United States was not itself seriously violating human rights in the name of the "war on terror."
<P></P>
President Bush can't talk about protecting human rights abroad on the one hand while the prison at Guantanamo Bay symbolizes U.S. human rights violations committed in the name of the "war on terror." Holding prisoners without charge and without end is a human rights abuse.  Disappearing suspects into secret CIA prisons is a human rights abuse. Interrogation techniques that amount to torture are a violation of human rights.  Amnesty International has repeatedly urged an end to these practices so that the world will once again recognize the United States as a beacon of hope for human rights.
<P></P>
Amnesty International issued the following responses to other points in the president's speech and/or global rights issues:
<P></P>
<strong>AIDS and Africa:
</strong>
<P></P>
Amnesty International recognizes the significant U.S. contributions to the Global Fund, and funding for PEPFAR, but believes the U.S. government can still do more. We also encourage greater recognition of the rights of young people and other vulnerable populations throughout the world to interventions that provide complete information about HIV prevention. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the hardest-hit by HIV/AIDS, with almost two thirds (63%) of the world's population living with HIV. Of the estimated 4.6 million people needing treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 23 percent receive it.  As the primary care providers for those infected and as they are more likely to be infected than men, women continue to suffer disproportionately and make up nearly 60 percent of all those living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.  
<P></P>
<strong>Peacekeeping in Africa:
</strong>
<P></P>
AIUSA welcomes additional U.S. support for capacity building for peacekeeping in Africa, while maintaining significant U.S. contributions to existing and critical regional and U.N. peacekeeping operations, as in Darfur, Sudan (AMIS transitioning to UNAMID) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC).
<P></P>
<strong>The Crisis in Darfur:</strong>
<P></P>
The administration has invested in progress toward peace and human rights in Darfur, and AI encourages the president to carry through on his promises to provide sufficient funding to peacekeeping operations (and an expected U.N. multidimensional peacekeeping operation with the EU in eastern Chad) and humanitarian assistance to all vulnerable civilians in Darfur, eastern Chad and northeastern CAR.
<P></P>
<strong>The United Nations Human Rights Council
</strong>
<P></P>
Amnesty International is disappointed that President Bush's support for human rights does not match U.S. actions in U.N. forums like the U.N. Human Rights Council. The organization appealed to President Bush to take a positive attitude towards the U.N. Human Rights Council and work with other nations to strengthen it.
<P></P>
<strong>Burma
</strong>
<P></P>
AIUSA welcomes the strong statement on Burma and urges President Bush to use UN mechanisms to advance human rights in Burma.
<P></P>
<strong>China
</strong>
<P></P>
It is disappointing that President Bush did not criticize China for its human rights abuses. AIUSA considers this a missed opportunity to speak out against the fact that 80 percent of the world's executions are taking place in China, that there are over a quarter of a million people imprisoned in labor camps without any charge or trial, and that the Tibetans and Uighur ethnic communities are facing extreme hardship and abuse.
<P></P>
<strong>Afghanistan
</strong>
<P></P>
AIUSA is concerned that President Bush did not address the plight of women and girls in Afghanistan. Even though the situation of women has improved since the fall of Taliban in 2001; there are still reports indicating discrimination.
