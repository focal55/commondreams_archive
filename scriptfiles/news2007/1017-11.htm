<p>WASHINGTON  - October 17 - “Just two days before the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. House of Representatives has renewed their support and commitment for clean and safe water by passing House Resolution 725. <br><br>“The resolution celebrates the progress made since the passage of the Clean Water Act – one of America’s most important laws for protecting the environment and human health – yet acknowledges the funding crisis our clean water infrastructure is currently facing. According to House Resolution 725, we will need between $300 and $400 billion over the next 20 years to maintain and improve wastewater infrastructure.<br><br>“Although last night’s vote is an important step toward recognizing clean water as a national priority, Congress must also recognize that an annual political battle over funding for something as basic as water makes no sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; National priorities that transcend state and local boundaries should receive perpetual funding streams, immune from shifting political currents. There are trust funds for highways, airports and social security. Clean water, a public resource utilized by all Americans, certainly warrants federal support and deserves the same protection.<br><br>“It’s time for Congress to create a trust fund that would provide a steady, reliable, and equitable source of funding for needed infrastructure investment across the country. It’s time for America to have clean and safe water for the next thirty-five years and beyond.”<br><!-- #EndEditable -->
