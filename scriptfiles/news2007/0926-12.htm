<p>  WASHINGTON - September 26 -Americans and others concerned that President George Bush is advocating the wrong approach to global warming at his "major emitters" summit here this week will meet outside the State Department for a rally at 12 p.m. on Friday, September 28.  The rally will be held in San Martín Park, at the corner of E Street, 21st Street, and Virginia Avenue NW.

 <P></P>

The rally will focus on sending the message to President Bush that he is going the "Wrong Way" on global warming.  Activists will hold up "Wrong Way" road signs and speakers will call for the United States to take a leadership role in fighting global warming.  Specifically, activists will ask the administration to:

 
 <P></P>
    * Support mandatory, rather than voluntary, limits on greenhouse gas emissions that would hold warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels
    <br>* Show leadership at home by cutting U.S. emissions at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, regardless of what other countries do
    <br>* Support the United Nations process that includes all nations and push for a strong-post Kyoto treaty
    <br>* Acknowledge that the "major emitters" causing global warming must help fund adaptation measures for the developing world

 
 <P></P>
Groups organizing the rally include the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Energy Action, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Oil Change International, SustainUS, the U.S. Climate Action Network, and the U.S. Climate Emergency Council.

  <P></P>

  <strong>WHAT:</strong>          "Wrong Way" Rally Responding to Bush's Major Emitters Summit

 
 <P></P>
 <strong>WHEN: </strong>12 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., Friday, September 28
