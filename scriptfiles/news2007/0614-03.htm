<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 14 - As NATO defense ministers gather today in Brussels to discuss ways of reducing the growing number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) called on the ministers to back up their concern with real funding to help Afghans harmed by NATO combat operations. 
 
<P></P>The meeting comes only days after US troops mistakenly killed at least seven policemen in an airstrike in eastern Afghanistan.  CIVIC today applauded NATO pledges to improve efforts to reduce unintended deaths, but said talk falls short of what’s really necessary.  “Afghans are rightly angered with every death – even if unintentional.  What happens after the smoke clears?” said Sarah Holewinski, CIVIC’s Executive Director. “NATO defense ministers are missing a golden opportunity to trump the Taliban’s public relations machine if they don’t leave Brussels with a pledge of compensation and aid to the ordinary Afghans caught in this war.”
 
<P></P>CIVIC notes that two programs exist to help Afghan civilians harmed – including injury, death and property damage – by US and NATO combat operations.  In late 2006, NATO countries created the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund to compensate people immediately after harm. However, only five of NATO’s twenty-six member countries have donated. The United States also founded and funds the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program to rebuild victims’ lives one by one, but the US remains the only donor. 
 
<P></P>“Without more funding to help Afghans harmed in the fighting, the war’s widows and orphans may never know NATO recognizes their loss,” said Holewinski. 
 
<P></P>CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and aided by the warring parties involved. Founded by the late Marla Ruzicka, a passionate humanitarian killed by a suicide bomb in Baghdad while advocating for war victims, CIVIC works toward smart, compassionate policies for civilians caught in the crossfire of conflict.
