<p>NEWARK, NJ - August 23 - The People's March For Peace, Equality, Jobs & Justice will be held
Saturday, August 25, 2007, 12:00 noon beginning at Lincoln Park in downtown
Newark, New Jersey.  The rally and march is being called by The Peace &
Justice Coalition which has more than 100 member organizations.  People
throughout the tri-state region are expected to attend.
<P></P>
"The purpose of the People's March for Peace, Equality, Jobs & Justice is to
bring public attention to our desire for an immediate end to the war in Iraq
and the violence in our streets, our demands for racial equality, the
creation of a massive jobs program, and the redirection of money for the war
towards domestic needs," said Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the People's
Organization For Progress and a spokesman for the coalition.
<P></P>
The march is being held on August 25th to coincide with the 44th anniversary
of the 1963 March On Washington For Jobs & Freedom, where Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr., gave his famous "I Have A Dream" speech, and the second
anniversary of the Hurricane Katrina disaster.  It is also being held this
year to coincide with the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the 1967
Newark Rebellion.
<P></P>
The event will begin at 12:00 noon with a rally at Lincoln Park.  Speakers
at the rally will include among others James Kelley whose son Clarence Lavon
Floyd was killed in Iraq, Rev. William Howard, Pastor, Bethany Baptist
Church, James Harris, State President, NAACP, Ray Stever, President, New
Jersey Industrial Union Council, Madelyn Hoffman, Executive Director, New
Jersey Peace Action, Jerome Harris, President, New Jersey Black Issues
Convention, poet/playwright Amiri Baraka, and Lawrence Hamm, Chairman,
People's Organization For Progress.  Hurricane Katrina survivor and New
Orleans resident Alice Craft-Kerney will also address the rally.
<P></P>
The invited guest speaker is Congressman John Conyers, Chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee.  Congressman Conyers will discuss his national health
insurance bill H. R. 676.
<P></P>
The rally will be followed by the march which will begin at Lincoln Park,
proceed up Broad Street to Military Park, and return to Lincoln Park.  There
will be a concluding rally at Lincoln Park.
<P></P>
The march and rally is a follow-up event to the People's Peace Conference
that was held in January at the Rutgers Law School and the People's Rally
for Peace & Justice held at Essex County College in March.
<P></P>
"All of these events are part of an on-going organizing effort to increase
African American and Latino participation in the peace movement and to link
the struggle to end the war to the struggle for racial, social, and economic
justice here at home," Hamm said.
