<p>WASHINGTON - January 5 - Report Issued as House of Representatives is Scheduled to Vote Soon to End Prohibition Preventing Medicare from Bargaining for Lower Drug Prices

<p>For all of the top drugs prescribed for seniors, Families USA is releasing a report that examines prices obtained by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compared to the prices charged by the five companies with the largest enrollment in the Medicare (Part D) drug program. Those companies enrolled approximately two-thirds of all seniors participating in Part D. The report focuses on comparative prices for the top drugs prescribed to seniors. 

<p>The new report will be released shortly before the House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a bill to end the current prohibition preventing Medicare from bargaining for cheaper drug prices. The bill is a top priority for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her new Democratic majority.

<p>WHAT: 	Press conference to discuss No Bargain: Medicare Drug Plans Deliver High Prices report

<p>WHEN:  	10:00 a.m. EST<br>

	Tuesday, January 9, 2007

<p>WHERE:	U.S. Capitol, Room HC6 (Basement)

<p>WHO:	Members of Congress <br>

	Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA
