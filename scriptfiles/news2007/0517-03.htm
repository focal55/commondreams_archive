<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 17 - This <a href="http://www.digitalads.org/" target="_new">invaluable report</a> is a wake-up call for policymakers and anyone concerned by the escalating epidemic of childhood obesity.  Even as junk food marketers claim to be cleaning up their act, the food industry is exploiting the latest technologies to target children in new and insidious ways.  Cell phones, instant messaging programs, video games, and virtual worlds are just some of the new media used to create a brave new world of interactive relationships between children and junk food brands. 

 

<P></P>We are encouraged that some policymakers and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission have turned their attention to the destructive role that food marketing plays in children’s lives.  As this report demonstrates, it’s essential to remember that a focus on television advertising alone is fighting yesterday’s battles.  If we are serious about promoting children’s health, we must examine – and regulate -- all marketing aimed at children.  

 

<P></P>The complete report is available at  <a href="http://www.digitalads.org/index.php" target="_new">http://www.digitalads.org/index.php</a>. 

 

<P></P>The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is a national coalition of health care professionals, educators, advocacy groups and concerned parents who counter the harmful effects of marketing to children through action, advocacy, education, research, and collaboration among organizations and individuals who care about children.  CCFC supports the rights of children to grow up – and the rights of parents to raise them – without being undermined by rampant commercialism.
