<p>WASHINGTON - August 27 -
Iraq War Veteran Evan Knappenberger, 1st BDE, 4th Infantry Division, is on day two of his weeklong vigil on a 6' scaffold on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Knappenberger is drawing attention to the US military’s STOP-LOSS and INACTIVE RESERVE policies, which he submits are being used as a substitute for conscription in a political war. The 24/7 vigil will run through Saturday, September 1st.

 
<P></P>
He was joined yesterday by a host of supporters including Tina Richards, activist mother of a young veteran; along with a number of Iraq Veterans, including Adam Kokesh and Tassi McKee.

 
<P></P>
This morning, shortly after a 30-minute interview with CNN, Knappenberger attended the press conference of Alberto Gonzalez to deliver a Moral Indictment, the tail-end of which he presented face to face with the former Attorney General. 

 
<P></P>
The tower is adjacent to the Washington Monument on the National Mall, between Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive and 14th and 15th Streets, NW. His action is supported by various organizations including the Washington Peace Center, Iraq Veterans Against the War, and Veterans for Peace.

 
<P></P>
While fulfilling his duties, Knappenberger witnessed the full effect of the administration’s policies on military personnel and the Iraqi people, and began to question those policies. He was given a General Discharge under honorable circumstances in April 2007. Now that he is home, he is committed to doing everything he can to represent his fellow soldiers and address the wrongs being done to them and their families. 

 
<P></P>
“I spent a year in Iraq. I pulled 97 nights on tower guard,” explained the 22 year-old intelligence veteran. “Many of the friends I served with have completed their Active Duty contracts. Now, they’re being sent back to Iraq for their third or fourth tours. Tours have been extended from 12 months to up to 18 months. Some soldiers are getting called up after living years of civilian life. Stop-loss is an unethical policy.” 

 
<P></P>
Knappenberger invites the public to talk with him while he is on Tower Guard to learn more about the unethical Stop-loss policy. His action is part of a month-long campaign of anti-war, pro-veteran protests taking place in Washington, DC and around the US.
