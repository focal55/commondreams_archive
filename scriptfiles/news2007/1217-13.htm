<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 17 -- As the debate over domestic spying begins in the US Senate 
today, the American Civil Liberties Union urges senators to reject the Bush 
administration’s spying free-for-all and not provide immunity to 
telecommunications companies that broke the law over the past six years.</p>
<p>Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office 
said, "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has decided to move the bad Senate 
Intelligence Committee bill. This is not good news for those of us who respect 
freedom, the rule of law and the Constitution. Instead of capitulating to the 
White House, senators should be listening to their constituents -- not telecom 
lobbyists or White House spinmeisters.</p>

<p>"After years of illegally wiretapping Americans on American soil, the White 
House now wants to let the telecommunications companies off the hook for their 
law breaking. Americans do not want the government to have the power to spy 
without warrants. Now, a Democratically-led Congress may be about to give this 
administration that power and is on the verge of giving the telecommunications 
companies a multimillion dollar Christmas present.</p>
<p>"We commend Senator Dodd for his statement on the Senate floor this morning 
and we urge other senators to stand with him to vote no against cloture and to 
strip telecom immunity from the bill. His courage in standing up to the 
administration’s power grab should be an example for Democratic leadership. If 
all of the Senate Democrats had the conviction of Senator Dodd, we wouldn’t need 
the threat of a filibuster."</p>
<p>Fredrickson also noted the following things we've learned and/or confirmed 
from this Sunday December 16, 2007 New York Times story about the 
telecommunications companies:</p>
<p>"1.&nbsp;It's Not About Terrorism. The massive wiretapping and data 
collection program isn't about defending us against future terrorist attacks -- 
the program started long before 9/11, in the 90’s, and was ramped up by this 
administration immediately after taking office.&nbsp;It's also routinely being 
used for run-of-the-mill drug cases to collect phone records that having nothing 
to do with terrorism.</p>
<p>"2. It's Not About Foreigners or Even International Calls.&nbsp;The NYT 
reveals that part of what made Qwest balk at the request in early 2001 was that 
the program was designed to pick up significant amounts of purely domestic 
communications by granting the NSA access "to their most localized 
communications switches, which primarily carry domestic calls" and that only 
"limited international traffic also passes through the switches."&nbsp;In fact, 
one anonymous engineer confirmed that creating the program to copy all the calls 
coming across one company's wires, "There was no discussion of limiting the 
monitoring to international communications."</p>
<p>"3.&nbsp;More than Just One Company Thought Some Aspect of the Program Was 
Illegal.&nbsp;The NYT also for the first time confirms that Qwest was not the 
only company to have reservations about the program.&nbsp;We know Qwest was 
approached long before 9/11 and refused to participate at all.&nbsp;Now we know 
that at least one more company had concerns about the legality about the program 
and "balked" in 2004.&nbsp;This undercuts the government's claims that everyone 
agreed the programs were legal.</p>

<p>"4. This is Not a Surgical Program Narrowly Targeted at 
Terrorists.&nbsp;Despite repeated assurances that the government does not 
conduct – and does not want to conduct – vast dragnet operations, "the N.S.A. 
met with AT&amp;T officials to discuss replicating a network center in 
Bedminster, N.J., to give the agency access to all the global phone and e-mail 
traffic that ran through it."</p>
