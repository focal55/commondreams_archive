<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 19 --<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What:</strong> Press Availability with women of CODEPINK to give anti-war movement's perspective on Congressional approval for more war funding.
<P></P>
<strong>Where/When:</strong> Capital entrance of Rayburn Building at 2pm
<P></P>
Last year, we were so hopeful that Congress would bring the troops home in time for the 2007 holidays. We are deeply disappointed to think of all the military families who won't be able to celebrate with their loved ones this year and we are devastated to think of the 3,895 military families who will never get to celebrate with their loved ones again, as well as the families of the estimated 1 million Iraqis who have lost their lives as a result of the occupation. Instead of standing up to an unpopular, heavily funded war, Congress is now the Grinch who stole the hope and holiday spirit from these families. <!-- #EndEditable -->
