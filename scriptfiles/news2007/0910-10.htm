WASHINGTON - September 10 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) released the following statement in opposition to today’s September 11 resolution:
<P></P>
“I honor the memory of those who died on September 11 and extend sympathies to their family members and to those who lost their lives trying to save lives,” Kucinich said.
<P></P>
“I support the troops. I believe the best way to honor the memory of those who died on September 11 is to tell the truth of what the Administration did in the wake of September 11. The Bush Administration launched a war against Iraq, conflating the true tragedy of September 11 with lies about weapons of mass destruction. 
<P></P>
“On this, the sixth anniversary of September 11, it is important that Congress wake up to the truth and exercise its obligation under the Constitution to save our nation from being destroyed from the lies that took us into Iraq, the lies that keep us there, the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against Iran and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home. The September 11 resolution that Congress considers today should have made reference to those matters. It does not, so I cannot support it.
<P></P>
“This Administration long ago politicized the September 11 attacks, distorted it and dishonored it.  If Congress really wanted to honor the memory of those who died on September 11, we would cause the full truth to be told to the American people. If Congress really supported our troops we would bring them home and not provide more funding for the war.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
