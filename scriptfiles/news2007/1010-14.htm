<P>WASHINGTON - October 10 - The ACLU responded to the president’s call for telecom amnesty in the RESTORE 
Act and two House Committees' vote to reject the immunity provision in mark-ups 
of the legislation.</p>
<p>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office: </p>
<p>"Why is the president of the United States trying to get the 
telecommunications companies off the hook for their illegal activity? He is 
supposed to be upholding laws, not encouraging companies to break them. 
Businesses that break the law should be held accountable. We expect these 
companies to keep our personal information private, and if they break the law, 
there should be consequences – not a re-write of the rule book. </p>
<p>"The House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees wisely rejected the 
president’s efforts to carry the water for the telecom companies and voted down 
an amendment that would add telecom amnesty to the bill. Members of Congress 
should not re-write laws just to get giant companies off the hook. They were 
elected to represent the American people, not big business.</p>
<p>"It is interesting that the president says his litmus test for acceptance of 
any bill to come from Congress hinges on the nod from Director of National 
Intelligence Mike McConnell, whose numerous exaggerations and misstatements have 
buoyed the ACLU and the Progressive Caucus’ efforts to get real civil liberties 
protections in any new FISA fixes."
