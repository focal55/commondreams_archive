<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Washington, DC - The U.S. Justice Department has
convened a grand jury to look into reports of safety, security and
environmental lapses at the chemical weapons storage operations of the
Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky, according to documents released today
by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). The
investigation was spurred by growing reports of high-level misconduct
and mismanagement from Depot staff, including concerns about the safety
of chemical munitions stockpiles.</p>
<p>In a letter dated February 8, 2007, Jeffrey Phillips, a Justice
Department lawyer in the Environmental Crimes Section, wrote that a
December 1, 2006 grand jury subpoena in the “on-going criminal
investigation” of “Chemical Weapons Activity” at the Depot requires
base staff to assemble:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Documentation concerning the Depot, such as might reflect
site conditions, deterioration of the chemical weapons storage area,
plans and training to account for leaks or terrorist attacks…”;</li>
  <li>“Environmental or technical investigation reports regarding the Chemical Weapons Activity”; and</li>
  <li>“All documents related to…worker safety and/or environmental compliance.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Located outside of Richmond (population 75,000) and 30 miles south
of Lexington, the Bluegrass Army Depot is charged with safeguarding
more than 500 tons of chemical warfare agents located in 45 storage
units called igloos, including the highly lethal nerve agent VX. The
igloos also contain live rockets, complete with propellants. The igloos
are supposed to be constantly monitored to detect any leak of chemical
agent or rocket propellant or any deterioration of storage conditions. </p>

<p>Whistleblowers have described a culture at Bluegrass Army Depot
which tolerates lapses in monitoring protocol and discourages reports
of problems. Significantly, the Justice Department is also seeking any
records of investigations directed against staff promotion, termination
and transfer decisions as well as “discussions related to…responses to
public inquiries, public investigations or this investigation.”</p>
<p>“This criminal investigation into problems at Blue Grass is long
overdue,” stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch, whose organization
is representing depot whistleblowers. “Even if the misconduct at Blue
Grass does not rise to the level of a crime, there has unquestionably
been a complete breakdown of management competence and integrity at
this sensitive facility as well as severe lapses in oversight by the
Depot’s parent agency, the Army Material Command.”</p>
<p>The Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department is
located in Washington, D.C. and its purpose is to assist U.S. Attorneys
in prosecuting environmental cases of national significance. In
addition, criminal prosecution of another federal agency is usually
reserved for cases in which individual managers are deliberately
falsifying records or taking other egregious steps to evade the normal
administrative controls within their chain-of-command.</em>
