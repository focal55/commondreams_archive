<p>WASHINGTON - September 12 - Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty has some explaining to do, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). The current president of the National Governors Association, Gov. Pawlenty will be at the National Press Club this afternoon to discuss "Securing a Clean Energy Future" with Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. Unfortunately Gov. Pawlenty's recent support to  build a new conventional coal-fired power plant would increase the state's reliance on the dirtiest source of energy and put that clean energy future in jeopardy.

 
<P></P>
Gov. Pawlenty likely will talk about how he has increased the amount of energy efficiency and clean, renewable electricity his state uses and set strong goals to reduce global warming emissions. But he likely will try to avoid the fact that his administration is supporting the construction of Big Stone II, a proposed coal-fired power plant that would serve his state and make his clean energy goals much harder to achieve.
<P></P>
 

In February, Gov. Pawlenty signed a bill requiring Minnesota's electric utilities to obtain 25 percent of their energy from renewable resources, such as wind and bioenergy, by 2025. Three months later the governor signed the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007, which requires utilities to increase energy efficiency to 1.5 percent per year. The law also sets a state target to reduce global warming emissions 80 percent by 2050, the level scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.

 <P></P>

That's the good news. The bad news is the Minnesota Department of Commerce recently endorsed Big Stone II. The proposed plant would spew 4.7 million tons of global warming emissions into the atmosphere annually, the equivalent of the global warming pollution emitted by approximately 700,000 cars-more than all the passenger vehicles registered in South Dakota. (For more information, go to: www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/fossil_fuels/bigstone2_backrounder.html.)

 <P></P>

Both the Department of Commerce and the utilities that want to build Big Stone II maintain the plant's emissions would be "offset," but the utilities would be allowed to claim offsets by investing in projects that do not actually reduce emissions. Moreover, the Commerce Department's agreement with the utilities would require the utilities to pay for only four-year's worth of offsets when the lifespan of a typical power plant is more than 40 years. The endorsement was especially puzzling given the department's own experts concluded the utilities had failed to satisfy a legal requirement to show there is a real need for the plant.
<P></P>
 

With such a strong record on increasing Minnesota's use of clean electricity and reducing its global warming emissions, Gov. Pawlenty's Commerce Department's support for Big Stone II brings up several questions.    
<P></P>
 

<li></li> Given Gov. Pawlenty's commitment to securing Minnesota's clean energy future, why did his administration recently settle with several utilities that propose to build a new conventional coal plant that will produce an estimated 4.7 million tons of global warming emissions?

 <P></P>

<li></li> Doesn't this settlement move Minnesota in the opposite direction of securing its "clean energy future"? 

 
<P></P>
<li></li> Why haven't the proponents of this project been required to consider the impact of these new laws on the need for this project?
<P></P>
