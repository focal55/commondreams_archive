<p>NEW YORK -  November 20 -The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is today commemorating the Transgender Day of Remembrance, the day when the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community remembers people lost to anti-transgender violence over the past year. The Task Force Web site banner is black today and features the phrase “We Remember,” in memory of the 11 known deaths of transgender people in 2007.</p> 

<p>This year marks the ninth year that the Transgender Day of Remembrance has been commemorated. A list of transgender people lost to violence can be found <a href="http://www.gender.org/remember/day/index.html" target="_new">here</a>. Events marking the day are being held in many cities across the United States, including New York City, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director<br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force</b></p>


 <p>“Anti-transgender hate violence remains disturbingly pervasive in our society. While we must continue to fight for hate crime laws that punish perpetrators of these crimes, and employment nondiscrimination laws that rightfully allow transgender people to keep their jobs and stay off the streets where they are more vulnerable to attacks, we must also continue to help every American understand who transgender people are and how anti-transgender bias leads to discrimination and violence. Until no more of our transgender friends and family are lost to senseless hate violence, we must not rest.”</p>

<p><font size="1"><i>The mission of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is to build the grassroots power of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. We do this by training activists, equipping state and local organizations with the skills needed to organize broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation, and building the organizational capacity of our movement. Our Policy Institute, the movement’s premier think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality and to counter right-wing lies. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a nation that respects the diversity of human expression and identity and creates opportunity for all. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Cambridge.<!-- #EndEditable -->
