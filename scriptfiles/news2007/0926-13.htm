<p>  WASHINGTON - September 26 -Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), issued the following statement after opposing H.J.Res. 52, the continuing resolution for FY2007:
<P></P>
“We do not have to fund the war. The Democratic leadership must tell the President NO to any additional funding. We can separately appropriate money to bring the troops home. The only thing required is honesty, integrity and a willingness to end the war,” Kucinich said.
<P></P>
“The Democratic leadership is playing into the Bush Administration’s hands by continuing to fund the war. What this Congress must realize is that we do not have to fund this war. We must leave Iraq now. That is what the American people want. That is why they voted for Democrats to take control of Congress last November. 
<P></P>
“Each year this war is getting more and more costly—both in the amount of money spent and in the number of lives lost. Now this Congress is providing more funds so the Administration can continue down a path of destruction and chaos.
<P></P>
“The Democratic leadership in Congress needs to take a stand against this President and say they will not give him any more money. That is the only way to end this war and bring our troops home.” 
<P></P>
The bill voted on today contains approximately $12 billion to continue the war in Iraq. Kucinich has consistently voted against funding for the war. On February 28, 2007, Kucinich introduced HR 1234, which is a plan for the United States to use existing money to bring the troops and necessary equipment home and transition to an international security and peacekeeping force. <!-- #EndEditable -->
