<p>WASHINGTON - February 21 - The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) and the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA) are pleased to present the 9th Annual Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Health Achievement Award to this year’s winner, Jessica Wang and QMass at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.  The award will be presented at 8 a.m. on Friday, March 9, 2007 as part of AMSA’s 57th annual convention in Washington, DC and again on Saturday September 29, 2007 at GLMA’s 25th Annual Conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico.     <P>
AMSA and GLMA established the Health Achievement Award to recognize a medical school, student group or individual student for exemplary achievement in promoting the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) health issues or concerns within a medical school. With this award, AMSA and GLMA solidify their joint commitment to advocacy for LGBT health concerns within the medical education environment.     <P>
“QMass really gets a boost of confidence and energy from being recognized by AMSA and GLMA.  This award helps to affirm that we are moving in the right direction with our projects and goals in GLBT healthcare awareness at UMass,” states Jessica Wang, leader of QMass and second year medical student at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.  “It is great to know that I can make a difference as an ally and that what I do is considered legitimate and important.”    <P>
“We are thrilled to present this year’s Health Achievement Award that recognizes the work of Jessica and her colleagues in QMass.  We were particularly impresses with QMass’ curricular advocacy and support network for LGBT and allied members,” says Elizabeth Eaman, AMSA national co-coordinator for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People in Medicine. “In light of this year’s ‘Coming Out As An Ally Day’ we are particularly proud that this year’s award with be accepted by an ally-identified student.”     <P>
“These students are leading the way to a future where LGBT patients receive care that’s as good as anyone else would receive. We are grateful for their efforts to eliminate the health disparities faced by LGBT communities,” said Joel Ginsberg, Executive Director of GLMA.
