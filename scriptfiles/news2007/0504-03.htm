<p>WASHINGTON - May 4 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America,&nbsp;today said that&nbsp;President Bush's&nbsp;recent&nbsp;letter to congressional leaders vowing to continue his reckless attacks on family planning and safe, legal abortion only underscores why he must be replaced with a pro-choice leader who will stand up for women's freedom and privacy.</p>

<p>The president sent the letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the same day of his party's first presidential primary debate, where the 10 candidates echoed similar anti-choice themes that reflected Bush's hostile anti-family-planning policies. </p>
<p>"George W. Bush essentially told the new Congress that he wants to continue denying millions of women access to essential medical services, including family planning and safe, legal abortion, even if it means jeopardizing their health. Just how is that 'pro-life'?" Keenan said. "Americans are tired of Bush's hypocritical, divisive attacks on a woman's right to choose. That's why they voted the anti-choice congressional leadership out of office. The GOP&nbsp;presidential&nbsp;candidates&nbsp;should&nbsp;take note that embracing Bush's agenda is not a smart strategy."</p>
<p>In his letter, Bush even refused to acknowledge any measures supported by pro-choice and pro-life members of Congress in both parties that would help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. </p>
<p>NARAL Pro-Choice America has worked with congressional leaders to develop the Prevention First initiative – a series of commonsense legislative proposals that have broad public support. Among other things, the Prevention First bills would improve family-planning services, require insurance companies to pay for birth control in the same way they cover other prescription medications, and make sure teens are taught honest, realistic sex education that protects them against disease.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For the past three years, NARAL Pro-Choice America has challenged President Bush to join this effort—but he refused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This letter shows, sadly, that President Bush is more interested in&nbsp;satisfying a vocal, narrow minority of his political&nbsp;base&nbsp;than focusing on Americans' priorities, " Keenan said. "His letter&nbsp;simply underscores the need to put a pro-choice president in the White House. That's the best way to stop these attacks on women's freedom and privacy."</p>
