<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 16 - Presidential candidate Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-CO) recently released a campaign commercial insinuating that all Muslim immigrants are terrorists. The ad simulates a terrorist attack at a shopping mall and shows footage of previous terrorist attacks. The Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of the Interfaith Alliance, released the following statement:
<p></p>
"Rep. Tancredo’s campaign commercial is outrageous. Rep. Tancredo has a long record of disparaging comments towards Muslims, including his support for bombing the Muslim holy city of Mecca without provocation. This Tancredo ad sinks even lower by creating fear of a terrorist attack. In the process, Rep. Tancredo insinuates that all Muslim immigrants are terrorists, which demonstrates an incredible lack of respect for America’s Muslim community. This ad is a last ditch effort to generate media attention for a candidate who is so out of touch with America at its best: a nation built on religious freedom and pluralism."
