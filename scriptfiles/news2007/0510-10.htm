<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 10 -        Last-minute news that a bill by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) mandating a withdrawal of American troops from Iraq has spurred a nationwide surge of support from anti-war activists, led by the national online progressive group TrueMajority.org.

 

<P></P>Word that the McGovern bill, H.R. 2237, would be taken up for debate came out Thursday morning. TrueMajority.org began alerting its list of anti-war activists by e-mail within ninety minutes, and almost immediately telephones began ringing in Congressional offices. More than 750 phone calls to Congress were reported within the first 45 minutes, and the pace was increasing as other national groups such as MoveOn and WAND joined the effort.

 

<P></P>"This is a moment which our members have been waiting for," said TrueMajority.org Executive Director Matt Holland. "Our 600,000 members have been clear about what they want from Congress – an end to the Iraq war. It's high time this debate was held."

 

<P></P>"The rapid response from TrueMajority.org members to this vote just goes to show how much pent-up energy there is in the country for bringing our troops home," Holland said.

 

<P></P>TrueMajority.org is a grassroots group of 600,000 Americans who believe in America's true values of openness, fairness and compassion. The group was an early leader in opposition to the Iraq War, and has worked to bring it to a conclusion consistently for four years with rallies, citizen lobbying, and online activism.
