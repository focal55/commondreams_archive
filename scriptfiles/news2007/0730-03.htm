<p>BOSTON - JULY 30 - The international relief and development agency
Oxfam America today called on the Newmont Mining Company to address human
rights abuses surrounding its Yanacocha Gold Mine in northern Peru. <br>

<br>
Late last year, Marco Arana and Mirtha Vasquez of GRUFIDES, a Peruvian
organization working on behalf of local communities affected by the
Yanacocha mine, received anonymous death threats and were subject to video
surveillance. An investigation by the Peruvian press uncovered that
individuals with ties to the security firm FORZA, which Newmont hired to
provide security at Yanacocha, were involved in the surveillance of the
GRUFIDES staff members. The spying and harassment have been subject to
investigations by human rights bodies from the United Nations and
Organization of American States, and denounced by various human rights
organizations, including Amnesty International.  While Newmont has denied
any involvement in the harassment or surveillance, the company has not
made a public statement formally distancing itself from these human rights
abuses.  Oxfam has urged the company since early this year to take
appropriate action to address these issues, which it has thus far failed
to do.<br>
<br>
"The mining industry has too often been associated with human rights
abuses," said Keith Slack, senior policy advisor on extractive industries
for Oxfam America.  "Newmont has a chance to change the way the industry
does business by handling this case in an open and transparent way."<br>
<br>
Newmont saw more trouble at the Yanacocha mine last month when villagers
from the community of Totorcocha entered Yanacocha property protesting the
company's failure to pay them for work on a potable water project.   They
were forcibly evicted by FORZA agents; 13 people were detained and brought
to the local police station, several people were injured. Local human
rights organizations and church groups have raised concerns about the
excessive force used and have called on Newmont to clarify its connection
to FORZA.<br>
 <br>
Oxfam is calling on Newmont to respect the human rights commitments it has
made under various voluntary multi-stakeholder initiatives, including the
United Nations Global Compact, the Voluntary Principles on Security and
Human Rights, and the International Council on Mining and Metals'
Sustainable Development Framework.  These initiatives share the
fundamental principle that companies must ensure their operations and
workers will respect the human rights of community members. <br>
 <br>
"Newmont's handling of recent problems at Yanacocha raises concerns about
the company's commitment to human rights," continued Slack.   "Respect for
human rights means investigating and taking an active stance against abuses
attributed to mine contractors." <br>

 <br>
Oxfam calls on Newmont to publicly demonstrate its commitment to human
rights by:<br>
<br>
</p><li> conducting an independent investigation of the human rights abuses in
Cajamarca, and<br>
<br>
</li><li> making a public statement in Peru explicitly and unequivocally
condemning the threats and harassment against Marco Arana, Mirtha Vasquez
and other representatives of civil society organizations. <br>
 <br>
<b>Oxfam America</b> works to ensure the oil, gas, and mining industries
respect the rights of community members impacted by extractive industries
projects, and that projects contribute to the long-term reduction of
poverty. <br>
