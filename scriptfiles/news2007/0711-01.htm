<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 11 - The Washington Post reports today that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made false statements to Congress while testifying about the Patriot Act.  In his testimony, Gonzales claimed that "there has not been one verified case of civil liberties abuse," after being sent at least six government reports in the months preceding his testimony documenting extensive legal and procedural violations of the law.<br><br>People For the American Way president Ralph G. Neas issued the following statement:<blockquote>“How much more do we need to hear?  Alberto Gonzales has established a pattern of deception.  He hasn’t been truthful with Congress or with the American people.  He is the nation’s top law enforcement official, and his term as Attorney General has been marked by a complete and total contempt for the Constitution and the notion of equal justice.<br><br>“The President continues to put himself and his administration above the law and to disregard the most basic checks and balances in our system.  Alberto Gonzales has misled Congress and the American people—Bush covered for him.  Scooter Libby was convicted by a jury of his peers—Bush commuted his sentence.  Sara Taylor and Harriet Miers are subpoenaed—Bush claims executive privilege.  This President will not hold his administration accountable.   It’s up to Congress to restore order to the Department of Justice and repair the damage that Bush and his cronies have done, and restore the faith of the American people.<br><br>“It’s well past time for the Attorney General to be removed from office.  Those members of Congress who still support the Attorney General are sending a clear signal to their constituents that they place partisan loyalty above honesty, justice, or the rule of law.”</blockquote>
