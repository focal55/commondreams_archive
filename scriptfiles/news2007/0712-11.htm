<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 12 - Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Arlen Specter (R-PA) today introduced legislation intended to reduce U.S. global warming pollution.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Statement by David Doniger, NRDC climate policy director, on the introduction of the Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>“The bill is another sign of growing political support for federal legislation to cut heat-trapping emissions. Unfortunately, the targets in the Bingaman-Specter bill will not cut emissions fast enough and deep enough to prevent dangerous global warming. &nbsp;Two-dozen major companies in the U.S. Climate Action Partnership support faster reductions than this bill would accomplish.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“Another issue is that achieving the bill's targets are not assured, because the bill allows industries to buy as many extra pollution rights as they want.&nbsp;The bill does contain constructive provisions to support deployment of new technology, assist low-income citizens, and assure American competitiveness. </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>“To avoid the most dangerous climate impacts, we need to cut U.S. emissions 15-20 percent by 2020, and 80 percent by mid-century.&nbsp;That is why NRDC supports the Sanders-Boxer Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act (S.309), and the Waxman Safe Climate Act (H.R. 1590).”</div>
