<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 14 -  Food insecurity remains static according to data released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

 
<p></p>
“The reality is that too many Americans continue to struggle to put food on the table,” said Rev. David Beckmann, President of Bread for the World.  

 <p></p>

The annual Household Food Security report shows that in 2006, 35.5 million people lived in “food insecure” households that don’t always have enough food—virtually unchanged since 2005. 

 <p></p>

“The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that still allows widespread hunger within its borders. This is a moral outrage,” said Beckmann. “If we are serious about making sure that none of our children go hungry, we must improve and expand national nutrition programs, especially the Food Stamp Program.

 <p></p>

“We can do that right now. While the 2007 farm bill is still being debated, we have a once-in-every-five-years chance to strengthen nutrition programs and really make headway in the fight against hunger. To make that happen, Senators must put aside special interests that are getting in the way of reforms needed to put the needs of hungry people ahead of a privileged few.”
<p></p>
 

“The Food Stamp Program is the flagship nutrition safety net for Americans. More than 26 million people per month receive food stamp benefits to help put food on the table. But the average benefit of $1 per meal per person is just not enough to buy adequate, nutritious food,” said Beckmann. “Increasing the benefit level for food stamp participants would make a big difference—especially for low-income working families, who are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet."

 <p></p>

Working families who don’t earn enough to escape poverty are the subject of Bread for the World Institute’s 2008 Hunger Report: Working Harder for Working Families, which will be released on November 19. While the U.S. economy continues to grow and create prosperity for some, many families have been left behind as wages for those at the bottom of the income scale remain stagnant or erode, coupled with the loss of good benefits such as employer-sponsored healthcare. Working Harder for Working Families explores ways to make the current set of work supports, including the Food Stamp Program, more responsive to the needs of low-income working families.

 <p></p>

Strengthening the nutrition safety net is part of Bread for the World’s 2007 legislative campaign on reforming the Farm Bill. Improvements sought in the Food Stamp Program include expanding the eligibility criteria, increasing participation rates and increasing the monthly benefit size.
