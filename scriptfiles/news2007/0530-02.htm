<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 30 - In response to President Bush's anticipated request  
today for a doubling of funds over the next phase of the "President's  
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief" (PEPFAR), Health GAP released an  
analysis showing the funding is not keeping pace with the spread of  
the epidemic. According to Health GAP's analysis, "doubling" spending  
merely maintains current levels of U.S. spending on AIDS. This,  
despite the fact that new infections are on the rise in many parts of  
the world, and only a very limited portion of HIV positive people who  
are in urgent clinical need of treatment have access, is unacceptable  
according to the group.

<P></P>"At the  Group of 8 Summit in 2005 and again at the UN General  
Assembly in 2006, Bush made a promise to reach universal access to  
HIV treatment and prevention,"
said Paul  Davis of Health GAP. "The U.S. share of the cost of  
keeping that promise will cost at least $45 billion over the next  
four years. Merely doubling U.S. spending would actually flatline  
spending at current levels. Moreover, a doubling would result in an  
overall decrease in the proportion of people with HIV on treatment  
because of U.S. investments."

<P></P>Health GAP called on Bush to commit to continuing support for one- 
third of those estimated to be in urgent clinical need of HIV  
treatment--a proportion that will increase to roughly 4 million people.

<P></P>According to advocates, PEFPAR in its second phase must urgently  
scale up its investments in training, retaining, and supporting  
doctors, nurses and community health workers, in order to meet  
existing targets and build toward new ones.

<P></P>"There is a catastrophic shortage of health workers in Africa, and  
unless PEPFAR commits to spending new money to address this crisis,  
the U.S. will not be able to meet its treatment and prevention goals-- 
or sustain its progress over the next phase of this program," said  
Asia Russell of Health GAP. At least $5.5 billion in additional  
spending by the U.S. is needed to invest in training and retaining  
health professionals during the next 4 years of PEPFAR.

<P></P>"Fighting AIDS in Africa without addressing the health worker crisis  
is like treating a massive hemorrhage with a handful of band-aids,"  
added Jose DeMarco of Health GAP. "PEPFAR must spend money to train  
and deploy new health workers and pay the providers who are at the  
heart of any successful AIDS response."

<P></P>PEPFAR was launched with controversial policy restrictions that have  
undermined the effectiveness of the initiative, according to  
evaluators. Health GAP called for Congress to repeal ideologically- 
motivated provisions in the second phase of PEFPAR, such as the  
earmark of spending at least one-third of prevention funding on ineffective "abstinence only until marriage" education. In addition,  
the wasteful program of FDA "tentative approval" for generic  
medicines should also be eliminated; although this process eventually  
resulted in procurement of generic medicines, it duplicates the  
efforts of the WHO because of political objections by the Bush Administration.

<P></P>The U.S. has dragged its feet in funding its fair share of the  
funding needs of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and  
Malaria, an critical complement to U.S. bilateral programs. The  
Global Fund announced a target size of $6-8 billion by 2010, and  
today advocates called on the U.S. to scale up its investments in the  
Global Fund, in order to achieve that target size.
