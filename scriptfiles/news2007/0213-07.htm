<p>WASHINGTON - February 13 - U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John 
          McCain (R-AZ) have reintroduced legislation to modernize the U.S. Army 
          Corps of Engineers. The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act 
          of 2007 builds upon legislation the Senators have previously introduced 
          to strengthen the Corps and would respond to some of the problems exposed 
          after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Last year, Feingold and McCain were 
          successful in including many of their proposed reforms in the Senate 
          version of the Water Resources Development Act. Subsequent negotiations 
          between the House and Senate stalled and no conference report was agreed 
          to.
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been over a year and a half since Hurricane Katrina 
          tragically exposed how broken our current water planning process is,&#8221; 
          Feingold said. &#8220;It is irresponsible for Congress to allow the 
          status quo to continue. By modernizing how the Army Corps of Engineers 
          plans, designs and carries out its projects, we can better ensure the 
          safety of Americans, proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and the 
          protection of our natural resources.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>&#8220;In the 110th Congress, we have another opportunity to take the 
          lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina and enact much needed reforms 
          to the way the Army Corps does business. We must shepherd in a new era 
          within the Army Corps that prioritizes critical projects and allows 
          the American taxpayers to know that their money is being spent in an 
          effective and efficient manner,&#8221; McCain said.</p>
          
        <p>The provisions Feingold and McCain were successful in attaching to 
          last year&#8217;s WRDA bill included independent review of Corps projects, 
          improved environmental mitigation standards similar to those already 
          followed by private parties, and updating the way the Corps plans and 
          analyzes projects. The legislation they are introducing today would 
          ensure that Corps projects protect communities, taxpayers, and the environment 
          by making needed adjustments to key aspects of water resources planning. 
          The legislation would help direct scarce federal resources to the projects 
          that need them the most and would ensure that those projects are properly 
          designed.</p>
          
        <p>The two Senators introduced Corps reform legislation together in the 
          107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses. Organizations that have already 
          announced their support for the bill include Taxpayers for Common Sense 
          Action, National Taxpayers Union, Council for Citizens Against Government 
          Waste, American Rivers, Association of State Wetland Managers, Defenders 
          of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, 
          National Wildlife Federation, Republicans for Environmental Protection, 
          Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, and the World Wildlife Fund.</p>

        <h3 align="center"><strong>Fact Sheet from U.S. Senators Russ Feingold 
          and John McCain</strong><br>
          <em><strong>On the Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act of 
          2007</strong></em></h3>
        <p>The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act of 2007 continues 
          the efforts of Senators Feingold and McCain to update and strengthen 
          the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and prioritize limited federal resources. 
          The bill seeks to add transparency to federal decisions, update the 
          basic planning guidelines used by the Corps, take better care of our 
          environment and - in the wake of the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina - 
          ensure outside review of Corps project planning and design and an assessment 
          of risks posed by future natural disasters.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em><u>The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act...</u></em></strong></p>
          
        <p><u>Guarantees Sound Projects and Responsible Spending</u> &#8211; To ensure 
          that Corps water resources projects are sound, the bill requires independent 
          review of those projects estimated to cost over $40 million, projects 
          requested by a governor of an affected state, projects that the head 
          of a federal agency has determined may have a significant adverse impact, 
          or projects that the Secretary of the Army has found to be controversial. 
          The Director of Independent Review can also require independent review 
          of the technical designs and construction of flood damage reduction 
          projects to ensure public safety and welfare.</p>
          
        <p><u>Identifies Vulnerabilities to Natural Disasters</u> &#8211; To assess our 
          vulnerabilities, the Water Resources Council is also charged with identifying 
          and reporting to Congress on the nation&#8217;s vulnerability to flood 
          and related storm damage, including the risk to human life, and recommendations 
          on improving the nation&#8217;s various flood damage reduction programs. 
        </p>
          
        <p><u>Values Our Natural Resources</u> &#8211; To better protect natural systems, 
          the bill brings the Corps&#8217; 1986 mitigation standards into line 
          with their regulatory program by requiring Corps water resources projects 
          to meet the same mitigation standard that is required of all private 
          citizens and other entities under the Clean Water Act. Where states 
          have adopted stronger mitigation standards, the Corps must meet those 
          standards. </p>
          
        <p><u>Prioritizes Our Resources</u> &#8211; To better inform federal decisions 
          and provide increased transparency, the bill restores the Water Resources 
          Council (established in 1965) and charges it with providing Congress 
          a prioritized list of all authorized water resource projects within 
          one year of enactment and every two years thereafter. This process would 
          give Congress the tools to more wisely invest limited taxpayer resources.</p>
          <p><u>Updates the Army Corps' Planning Guidelines</u> &#8211; To improve 
            the process by which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers analyzes water 
            projects, the bill requires that the Water Resources Council work 
            in coordination with the National Academy of Sciences to propose periodic 
            revisions to the Corps&#8217; planning principles and guidelines, 
            regulations and circulars. The principles and guidelines, which bind 
            the Army Corps of Engineers, have not been updated since 1983. </p>
