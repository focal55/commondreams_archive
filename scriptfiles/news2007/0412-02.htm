<p>			Washington, DC - Last evening, David Brock,
President and CEO of <i>Media Matters for
America</i> released the following statement regarding the decision of NBC
News to cancel MSNBC's simulcast of <i>Imus
in the Morning</i>.</p>

<p><b>"By canceling their simulcast
of Don Imus on MSNBC, the National Broadcasting Company has finally done the
right thing. We hope CBS Radio will again follow NBC's lead.</b></p>

<p><b>More and more Americans are coming to
understand the damage done by major news organizations providing a platform for
bigoted commentary and other conservative misinformation, and they are
demanding change.  MSNBC's decision is an important step in the
right direction.</b></p>

<p><b>This decision sends a clear message
to other networks, journalists and media personalities that bigotry and hate
speech have no place on America's
airwaves.</b> </p>

<p><b>The cable networks would be well
advised to think twice about their broadcasting decisions in the future. It is
our hope that this will open a larger dialogue on the overall tone of the media
today."</b></p>

<p>As first
posted by <i>Media Matters for America</i>,
on the April 4 edition of MSNBC's <i>Imus in
the Morning</i>, host Don Imus referred to the Rutgers University
women's basketball team, which is <a href="/rd?http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-women/roster/roster-alph.asp" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-women/roster/roster-alph.asp">comprised</a>

of eight African-American and two white players, as "nappy-headed hos"
immediately after the show's executive producer, Bernard McGuirk, called the
team "hard-core hos." Later, former <i>Imus</i> sports announcer Sid Rosenberg, who was filling in for
sportscaster Chris Carlin, said: "The more I look at Rutgers,
they look exactly like the [National Basketball Association's] Toronto Raptors."</p>

<p>After reportedly defending his April 4 description of
the Rutgers University women's basketball team,
which is <a href="/rd?http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-women/roster/roster-alph.asp" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-women/roster/roster-alph.asp">comprised</a>
of eight African-American and two white players, as "nappy-headed
hos," on the April 6 edition of MSNBC's <i>Imus
in the Morning</i>, host Don Imus apologized for the remark. Imus called
his comments "insensitive and ill-conceived," adding that
"[i]t was completely inappropriate, and we can understand why people were
offended." He further called the comments "thoughtless and
stupid." <i>Media Matters for America</i>

<a href="/items/200704040011" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200704040011">noted</a> Imus' initial
comments at the time.</p>

Incendiary Remarks<br></b>

<p>Though Don Imus continued to apologize this morning
for calling members of the Rutgers University women's basketball team
"nappy-headed hos" on his nationally syndicated radio program <i>Imus in the Morning,</i> which is simulcast on
MSNBC, his comments are just the latest in a long history of racial slurs made
on the show by Imus, his guests, and regular contributors. Below are several
examples of remarks made by Imus and others on his program documented by <i>Media Matters for America</i> over the past
few months:</p>

<p><b>Fineman to pal Imus: Racist
comments aren't OK any more like they used to be<br></b>

<p>Discussing host Don Imus' April 4 <a href="/items/200704040011" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200704040011">comments</a> on MSNBC's <i>Imus in the Morning</i> -- in which Imus
referred to the Rutgers women's basketball team as "nappy-headed hos"
-- and the controversy that ensued, <i>Newsweek</i>
editor Howard Fineman, appearing on the April 9 edition of <i>Imus in the Morning,</i> asserted:
"[I]t's a different time, Imus ... it's different than it was even a few
years ago, politically," and added that "some of the stuff that you
used to do, you probably can't do anymore." Fineman continued, "I
mean, just looking specifically at the African-American situation. I mean,
hello, [Sen.] Barack Obama's [D-IL] got twice the number of contributors as
anybody else in the race," and added, "[T]hings have changed. And
the kind of -- some of the kind of humor that you used to do you can't do
anymore. And that's just the way it is."</p>

Globe</i> columnist Tom Oliphant began his appearance on the April 9
edition of <i>Imus in the Morning</i> by
stating: "Good morning, Mr. Imus, and solidarity forever, by the
way." Oliphant also referred to political pundits like himself who appear
on the show as Imus' "constituency."</p>
