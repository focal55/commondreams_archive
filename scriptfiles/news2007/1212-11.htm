<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 12 - A coalition of public interest groups and technology innovators today formed the Wireless Innovation Alliance, a campaign to utilize valuable vacant broadcast airwaves — known as ‘white spaces’ — for wireless Internet access. <br><br>Free Press Policy Director <b>Ben Scott</b> issued the following statement:<br><br>“Internet access is rapidly becoming one of the most important services in our economy and society — but too many American cities and towns are still stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide. Unlicensed ‘white spaces’ are perfectly suited to remedy this situation. <br><br>“Every market in the country has vacant portions of the public airwaves that aren’t occupied by TV channels. In some communities, more than three-quarters of available television spectrum is unused — representing billions of dollars in squandered public resources. <br><br>“Tens of thousands of citizens across the country have spoken out in support of making this spectrum available on an unlicensed, mobile basis. Future devices could use the vacant airwaves to connect tens of millions of Americans to the information superhighway, including many rural areas still stuck on dial-up — or without any service at all. <br><br>“Opening up these white spaces is key to creating the healthy competition, consumer choices and technological innovation we need to provide an open Internet to everyone.”<br><br>For more information on white spaces, visit <a href="http://www.freepress.net/spectrum/=whitespaces" target="_new">http://www.freepress.net/spectrum/=whitespaces</a><!-- #EndEditable -->
