<p> ATLANTA  &ndash;- May 1 – In a hearing today, the American Civil Liberties Union 
urged Wilkinson County Superior Court to return a vulnerable seven-year-old girl 
to the woman in whose care she had been thriving for a year. The county’s 
Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) has held the girl in foster care 
since February 20, when a judge took her away after he learned that she was 
being raised by a lesbian.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen Emma for over two months, and it breaks my heart to know that 
she’s not doing well in foster care right now,” said Elizabeth Hadaway, a 
28-year-old paramedic who first took in the little girl when the child’s 
biological mother asked her to raise and adopt Emma.&nbsp; “Even DFCS’s own 
child welfare expert agreed that she should never have been taken from her home 
and that she needs the kind of individual attention I was able to give her, but 
because of one judge’s bias this little girl who’s been through so much is 
living with strangers.&nbsp; I just hope she knows how much I love her and how 
determined I am to bring her home.” </p>
<p>Hadaway has been caring for Emma for almost a year and the child calls her 
“Mommy.” Their predicament came after several months of legal proceedings in 
which Hadaway fought to keep her. The little girl’s biological mother, who had 
sole custody, asked Hadaway to raise and adopt the child after struggling for 
years to care for her in spite of a variety of problems that included financial 
hardships and a difficult life on the road as a truck driver.&nbsp; With the 
biological mother’s blessing, Hadaway was granted legal custody in 2006.&nbsp; 
Under Hadaway’s care, the child began making great strides in her schoolwork, 
self-confidence, and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Several months later, Wilkinson County Superior Court Judge John Lee Parrott 
was on the verge of granting Hadaway’s request to permanently adopt Emma when he 
noticed in the home study that Hadaway was living at the time with her partner 
of seven years and abruptly changed his mind.&nbsp; In January of this year, 
Parrott denied the adoption, ordering that Emma be sent back to her biological 
mother.&nbsp; Hadaway complied and met with the biological mother at a truck 
stop to hand over the girl.&nbsp; After accepting custody, thus satisfying 
Parrott’s order, the biological mother saw how distraught Emma was at being 
taken from Hadaway and again insisted that Hadaway should raise the girl.&nbsp; 

</p>
<p>Hadaway, who had ended her relationship with her partner and moved with 
Emma to Bibb County in late December, again applied for custody in her new home county with the biological 
mother’s full consent.&nbsp; Shortly after that, Parrott ordered the little girl 
be taken from her home to live in foster care on February 20 in spite of the 
biological mother’s wishes.&nbsp; In early April a Bibb County judge then 
granted custody of the child to Hadaway, after hearing evidence from an expert 
commissioned by Wilkinson County DFCS to study Emma in her foster home.&nbsp; 
The expert found that the little girl is unable to get the individualized 
attention she needs in her foster home and experiencing emotional trauma because 
of the separation from Hadaway.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, Parrott found Hadaway and her attorney in contempt of 
court, and sentenced them to jail time and a fine.&nbsp; In today’s hearing, the 
ACLU argued that Wilkinson County DFCS must allow Emma to return home.</p>
<p>“There are thousands of children in our state’s foster care system who need 
good homes, but this little girl already had a home where she was loved and 
cared for, and was torn from it for no other reason than that Elizabeth is a 
lesbian,” said Gerry Weber, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia, who argued 
before the court this morning.&nbsp; “DFCS’s own expert agrees that letting Emma 
go home is in her best interest.&nbsp; Elizabeth’s sexual orientation shouldn’t 
even enter into the decision.”</p>

<p>“Social science research has consistently shown for decades that children of 
gay parents are just as well-adjusted as children of straight parents,” said Ken 
Choe, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s national Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Project.&nbsp; “A judge must act in a child’s best interests.&nbsp; 
By taking Emma away from Elizabeth, despite the loving home that Elizabeth had 
provided for Emma, solely on account of Elizabeth’s sexual orientation, Judge 
Parrott did not act in Emma’s best interests.”</p>
<p>Hadaway is represented by Weber and Maggie Garrett of the ACLU of Georgia, 
Choe and James Esseks of the ACLU’s national LGBT Project, and cooperating 
counsel Dan Bloom of Pachman Richardson, LLC in Atlanta and Amy Waggoner of 
Aussenberg Waggoner, LLP in Alpharetta.</p>
