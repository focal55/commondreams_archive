<p>WASHINGTON - September 17 - State renewable electricity standards (RES) are cutting pollution, saving money, creating jobs, and fueling a clean energy boom in all 25 U.S. states that have passed similar policies, according to a new report released today by U.S. PIRG. U.S. PIRG also called on Congress to establish a national RES.
<P></P>
America now generates twice as much electricity from the wind and the sun as it did just four years ago. RES policies have been among the most important factors in encouraging the development of renewable energy. The new report, "Reaping the Rewards," documents the benefits that have already been achieved by states that have adopted renewable electricity standards.
<P></P>
“Citizens across the nation are already reaping the rewards from the states’ leadership on clean energy,” said U.S. PIRG Clean Energy Associate Sean Garren. “Thanks to state renewable electricity standards, clean energy is booming in the U.S.,” continued Garren.
<P></P>
"Reaping the Rewards" found that RES states are leading the way in renewable energy development.
<P></P>
· In 2006, more than two-thirds of all new renewable electric generating capacity in the United States was built in RES states. In 2007, more than 70 percent of planned renewable generation is expected to be built in RES states.
<P></P>
· Texas stands out as the state with the most aggressive renewable energy development in recent years, adding 2,000 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity. Texas is followed by Washington, New York, and Colorado.
<P></P>
· Renewable energy is addressing a greater share of new energy needs in RES states. In 2007, renewables account for about 38 percent of planned capacity additions in RES states, compared to just 12 percent in non-RES states.
<P></P>
The report also found significant environmental benefits as a result of new renewable energy development. Renewable energy sources built after the adoption of state RES policies will:
<P></P>
·        reduce America’s global warming emissions by approximately 8.4 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of taking more than 1.5 million cars off America’s roads.
<P></P>
·        avert approximately 2,100 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions, 44 tons of sulfur dioxide emissions, and 220 tons of non-methane hydrocarbon emissions each year.
<P></P>
·        save approximately 1.2 billion gallons of water per year.
<P></P>
Renewable energy can play an important role in revitalizing America’s economy by creating new high quality jobs and accelerating rural economic development. Renewable energy has had particular benefits for rural economies. Texas landowners, for example, now receive an estimated $9.5 million in royalty payments from wind farm operators, while one town in rural Colorado saw its tax base increase by 29 percent as a result of a wind farm development there. RES policies also play an important role in attracting manufacturing facilities by making a long-term commitment to building the market for renewable energy technologies.
<P></P>
“State officials across the nation deserve tremendous credit for recognizing the benefits of jumpstarting renewable energy and taking action,” said Garren.
<P></P>
In order to expand the benefits of renewable energy development, the report concludes that the United States should adopt a renewable electricity standard requiring at least 25 percent of America’s electricity to come from new renewable sources by 2025. This summer, the House passed a national RES that would establish a 15 percent requirement. The Senate also passed energy legislation this summer, but did not include an RES. The Senate can accept the House RES when the two bills are negotiated in conference this fall.
<P></P>
“After a decade of leadership in the states, it is time for Congress to follow,” said Garren. “The House has taken an important step in the right direction by passing the RES, and the Senate should join them. In addition to strong fuel economy improvements and energy efficiency provisions, no energy bill will be complete without a national renewable electricity standard,” continued Garren.
