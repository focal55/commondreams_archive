<b><a href="mailto:cole@law.georgetown.edu" target="_new">DAVID COLE</a></b><br>
Professor at Georgetown University Law Center, Cole is co-author of the recently-released <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1595581332?tag=commondreams-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1595581332&adid=19GBKPT1D6NKBXNQSBFP&" target="_new">Less Safe, Less Free: Why America Is Losing the War on Terror</a></i>. He said today: "If the United States is to recover from the damage done by the administration's past dissembling on torture, we need an Attorney General who can say, clearly and unequivocally, that waterboarding is torture. This is elementary to the rest of the world, and until we recognize that, the United States's reputation as a country that tolerates torture will continue."<br>
<br>
Today, the government is dropping the "LA 8" case in which it has sought for 21 years to deport a group of Palestinians based on secret "evidence." Cole, a volunteer attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, was a lawyer in the case and wrote "<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20031027/cole" target="_new">9/11 and the LA 8</a>." <br>
