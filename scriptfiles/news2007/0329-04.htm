<p>Washington, DC —Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich gave
the following speech on the floor of the House of Representatives today:<br>
<br>“Today the House will pass a budget which will fund the Iraq War far into 2009! <br><br>“The
budget includes an extra $195 billion, mostly for military operations
in Iraq. Anyone who thinks this Congress is trying to end the war had
better think again because this budget signals we will be in Iraq for
another two years or more, even though Congress has led the American
people and the media to believe otherwise.<br><br>“Congress recently engaged in dubious debate about a non-binding surge resolution.<br><br>“Even though Congress had, and still has the authority to end the war now, we instead gave it new life with last week’s vote.<br><br>“Now
$195 billion, on top of last week’s supplemental, means that close to
$300 billion in a week has been approved to continue the war.<br><br>“This war has sacrificed the lives of our troops and innocent civilians.<br><br>“This war has advanced the interests of oil companies and contractors in the manner of a criminal enterprise.<br><br>“It has undermined our national honor and alienated friends around the world.<br><br>“When will Congress stand for truth and peace, and stop funding this war?”
