<p>WASHINGTON - November 5 - Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder issued the following statement in response to Senator Clinton's introduction of a global warming proposal today and its relation to legislation she will soon face in a Senate committee:
<P></P>
"This proposal sets the right goals, but the key question is where Senator Clinton will come down on the Lieberman-Warner bill -- the global warming legislation moving right now in the Senate.  The Lieberman-Warner bill does not reduce emissions at the rate science tells us is required. Moreover, it gives away a staggering $500 billion dollars to coal and other corporate polluters.  Senator Clinton will have a chance to vote on this bill in committee.  One of her opponents, John Edwards, has already come out against the bill.
<P></P>
"The standards  Senator Clinton announced today are flatly inconsistent with Lieberman-Warner.  We call on her to show leadership by opposing this bill in its current form and demanding better."
<P></P>
Last month, Friends of the Earth Action endorsed John Edwards for president, based on his leadership on global warming and other environmental issues.
