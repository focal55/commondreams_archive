<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 -An important transparency provision promoted by the Sunlight Foundation to mandate the Internet disclosure of members of Congress' personal financial information was included in the Honest Leadership bill unveiled last night by House Democratic leaders. For the first time ever, Congress would require that these members' reports be posted on the Internet to be accessible to the public. 

<P></P>
"This is a great victory for transparency in the House of Representatives and for the public, whose outcry to change the culture of Congress has prevailed," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, commends Speaker Pelosi and House Democratic leadership for introducing this important legislation to create significant reform measures that will create a more accountable Congress with meaningful public access.

<P></P>
Members' Personal Financial Disclosure Statements are required to be filed annually and are key to uncovering potential financial conflicts of interest. Although the statements have long been required to be public, they are currently only available to citizens who can be physically present on Capitol Hill to view and copy them. Under this bill, Congress would be responsible, for the first time, to make that information truly public to all who wish to access it. This bill -- 'The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (H.R. 2316) -- is the companion to the 'Legislative Accountability and Transparency Act of 2007' (S. 1), passed by the Senate earlier this year.

<P></P>Founded in January, 2006, the mission of the Sunlight Foundation is to strengthen the relationship between lawmakers and their constituents. Sunlight puts information and tools in citizens' hands so they can learn more about what Congress and their elected representatives are doing. Its ultimate goal is full transparency by Congress, its Members and staff will help reduce corruption, ensure greater accountability, and foster public trust in this vital institution of democracy. Since its founding, the Sunlight Foundation has issued nearly $2 million to groups to digitize existing information about Congress and those that use Internet technology to further Sunlight's goals. Additionally, the Sunlight Foundation has fostered its own projects such as Congresspedia, OpenCongress.org and Congress' Family Business.
