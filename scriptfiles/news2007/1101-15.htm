<p>NEW YORK- November 1 - New York City Councilman Eric Gioia says he supports Brave New Films' call for an investigation of former Mayor Giuliani's failure to provide New York City firefighters with radios that could have saved lives on 9/11, as documented in a recent short video documentary from BNF called The Real Rudy: Radios. "I will do everything in my power to get answers, to get the truth," Councilman Gioia announced after receiving a BNF-launched petition with 20,000 names on it. "There needs to be accountability." As Chair of the Oversight and Investigations Committee, Councilman Gioia is authorized to take steps to initiate a public hearing.
<P></P>

The petition, which was hand delivered to Councilman Gioia on Monday, October 29th, requests a public investigation to uncover why Giuliani did nothing to improve FDNY radio performance for seven years after the 1993 World Trade Center attack, and why the Giuliani administration then awarded Motorola with a no-bid contract for new radios that were not field tested, did not work properly and were immediately pulled from the field. As a consequence of the inability of the firefighters' antiquated radios to receive police broadcasts, firefighters in the North Tower never received an alert from an NYPD helicopter that the building was in danger of collapse, and remained in place while police officers evacuated. The building's collapse killed 121 firefighters.

<P></P>
The documentary and a video with Gioia's response can be viewed at <a href="http://therealrudy.org/radios" target="_new">http://therealrudy.org/radios</a>

Based on months of research and interviews, The Real Rudy: Radios includes testimonies from Wayne Barrett, senior editor of The Village Voice and author of "Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11;" Glenn Corbett, Fire Science Professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice; FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches, who lost his son on 9/11; Retired FDNY Chief of Safety Al Santora, who also lost his son on 9/11, and several other experts and relatives of deceased firefighters. In 17 days, The Real Rudy: Radios has garnered 103,255 views, and reached YouTube's #1 most viewed News & Politics video the day after its release.
