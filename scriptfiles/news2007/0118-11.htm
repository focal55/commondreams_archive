<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - In response to yesterday’s news that the Republicans had killed the Senate ethics reform package, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington executive director Melanie Sloan stated, “Republicans are trying to disguise the fact that they are killing ethics reform by clamoring for the line item veto amendment, a provision they had ample opportunity to pass when they were in the majority.  The Republicans continue to misread the American public's sensitivity to issues of congressional ethics.”  Sloan continued, “After their losses in the November elections, Republicans had suggested they were committed to passing meaningful ethics reform, but yesterday’s actions belie that claim. Americans will not be satisfied with the unethical status quo and the Senate Republicans should drop their opposition to ethics reform and follow their House colleagues’ lead in working with the Democrats to pass this important legislation.”</p>
