<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 - 
<p>Quote From John Stauber of The Center For Media And Democracy:
<br>
"This appears a great victory for journalist Sarah Olson and our Defend the Press coalition," said John Stauber, executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy of Madison, Wisconsin. "This is a testament to what one determined and courageous reporter, Sarah Olson, can accomplish in the face of government intimidation. These subpoenas were simply an effort to harass journalists who are reporting on the growing anti-war sentiment among rank and file soldiers. This is a blow for press freedom and for free speech."
 
<p>Quote From Journalist Sarah Olson:<br>
"This is obviously a great victory for the principles of a free press that are so essential to this nation.  Personally, I am pleased that the Army no longer seeks my participation in their prosecution of Lieutenant
Watada. Far more importantly, this should be seen as a victory for the rights of journalists in the U.S. to
gather and disseminate news free from government intervention, and for the rights of individuals to express personal, political opinions to journalists without fear of retribution or censure. I am glad the growing number of dissenting voices within the military will retain their rights to speak with reporters. But I note with concern,  that Lt. Watada still faces prosecution for exercising his First Amendment rights during public presentations.  The preservation of these rights clearly requires vigilance. 
 
<p>Journalists are subpoenaed with an alarming frequency, and when they do not cooperate they are sometimes imprisoned. Videographer Josh Wolf has languished in federal prison for over 160 days, after refusing to give federal grand jury investigators his unpublished video out takes. It is clear that we must continue to demand that the separation between press and government be strong, and that the press be a
platform for all perspectives, regardless of their popularity with the current administration."
 
 
<p>Quote From Olson's Attorney David Greene, The First Amendment Project:<br>
"This is a tremendous victory for both Sarah and for every journalist who fears being dragged into the middle of a dispute between a source and the government"

<p>Sarah Olson and Defend The Press will be holding a Press Conference at 2pm on Thursday Feb 1st 2007 at The National Press Club in Washington, DC.
