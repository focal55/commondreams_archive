<p>Washington - In a 63 - 34 vote, the Senate today passed <a href="http://www.now.org/congress/issues/bills/?bill=9620271">S. 5</a>,
a bill that would allow — for the first time — federal funding of all
forms of stem cell research utilizing donated human embryos that would
otherwise be destroyed. Stem cell research has enormous potential in
finding cures, remedies and treatments for debilitating and
life-threatening injuries and illnesses such as Parkinson's disease,
Alzheimer's and diabetes, to name a few. The House passed a similar
version of the bill in January, and George W. Bush has threatened once
again to veto the bill. </p>
	<p> "Stem cell research is a woman's
issue through and through," said NOW President Kim Gandy. "Women are
the majority of this country's caregivers, and when family members
experience tragic accidents, become ill or suffer chronic conditions,
it often falls to women to care for them. The research supported by
this bill could someday help alleviate the suffering as well as the
mental and financial stress associated with many chronic and fatal
diseases," said Gandy. </p>
	<p> "Today's vote reflects the wishes of
this country, and we thank the Senators who voted to expand this
important research," Gandy added. According to a recent poll, 62
percent of people in the U.S. approve of medical research using
embryonic stem cells, and nearly 60 percent want more taxpayer money to
be used for this promising line of research.Bush's previous veto and
threatened veto of this current bi-partisan proposal exposes his
willingness to play to his radical right-wing base, regardless of the
outcome. </p>
	<p> "This president has ignored the health and welfare
of women and their families for too long. Today's vote is a sign that
the climate is shifting around him," said Gandy."We must to continue to
change the face of politics until preserving the health and wellbeing
of women, girls and families is a top priority in this nation." </p>

<p>Shortly after the U.S. Senate passed S. 5, they also passed stem
cell legislation sponsored by U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and
Norm Coleman, (R-Minn.) regarding federal funding for embryonic stem
cell research. The misleadingly named, "Hope Offered through Principled
and Ethical Stem Cell Research (HOPE) Act,” or S. 30, would permit
federal funding scientific research on embryos that have 'died
naturally'. This legislation places severe restrictions on the ability
to conduct research on what may prove to be the most promising stem
cells. </p>
<p>"Clearly, this is another attempt to insert political control over
science and medicine. We hope that the President will do the right
thing and sign S. 5 and that the U.S. House of Representatives will do
the right thing and not consider any legislation intended simply to
undercut scientists' ability advance research and lifesaving medical
treatments," said Gandy.</p></i><!-- #EndEditable -->
