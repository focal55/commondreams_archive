<p>SAN FRANCISCO – Rainforest Action Network accused Weyerhaeuser
Corp. of human rights abuses today after the company refused to support
viable alternatives to sourcing wood from massive clear-cut logging
operations within the ancestral homeland of the Grassy Narrows First
Nation, a Native community in northwestern Ontario. The allegation
comes just two days before Weyerhaeuser’s annual shareholder meeting in
Federal Way, Wash.<br><br>In addition, an Amnesty International
research team began a 4-day fact-finding mission in the traditional
territory of the Grassy Narrows First Nation yesterday to document the
impact of logging and other industrial development on the community’s
rights and culture. The goal of the mission is to shed light on the
plight of the community and convince all parties to respect the call by
Grassy Narrows’ leaders for a moratorium on all industrial development
on their land without prior consent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>"The
purpose of this mission is to see first-hand how the course of
industrial development in their traditional territories has impacted
the enjoyment of human rights at Grassy Narrows," wrote Alex Neve,
Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, in an open letter to
Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty. "The Government of Ontario is failing
the people of Grassy Narrows. Decisions with a profound impact on the
community’s use of the land have been made with little or no meaningful
consultation, much less consent. Clear demonstrations of community
opposition to provincial decisions have been ignored."<br><br>A
research team of four people, including Neve, will meet with community
members to discuss the impacts of government decisions on health,
culture and livelihood. The other team members include Celeste McKay, a
Metis researcher from Manitoba; Sheena Graham, an Aboriginal woman from
western Australia and community organizer with Amnesty International
Australia; and Craig Benjamin, Amnesty Canada’s campaigner for the
Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples.<br><br>“Abitibi and Weyerhaeuser
continue to rely on outdated cut-and-run practices that have devastated
rural communities for decades,” said Brant Olson, director of
Rainforest Action Network’s Old Growth Campaign. “The presence of
Amnesty International in Grassy Narrows is a wakeup call to North
Americans who think that human rights abuses on the homefront are a
thing of the past.”<br><br>The people of Grassy Narrows depend on the
land for hunting, fishing and other cultural activities, all of which
have suffered due to rampant clear-cut logging on their land.
Weyerhaeuser’s Kenora iLevel Timberstrand mill is the top consumer of
wood from Grassy Narrows territory. The wood is used to produce
homebuilding materials used throughout the U.S. by Weyerhaeuser’s
homebuilding subsidiaries, including Quadrant Homes, Pardee Homes,
Marquee Homebuilders and Winchester Homes. Years of opposition to the
logging have been ignored by both the Canadian government and companies
like Weyerhaeuser that continue to profit from logging on Grassy
Narrows’ ancestral land.<br><br><strong>RAN to Attend Weyerhaeuser Annual General Shareholder Meeting Thursday</strong><br><br>Activists
from Rainforest Action Network will attend Weyerhaeuser’s Annual
General Shareholder Meeting (AGM) this Thursday. RAN will support a
resolution filed by Capital Strategies Consulting, Inc., requesting “a
feasibility assessment to suspend wood procurement from Grassy Narrows’
territory until the free, prior, and informed consent of the community
has been established.” The resolution contends that Weyerhaeuser’s
ongoing procurement of wood from Grassy Narrows violates
internationally recognized human rights and established industry best
practices.<br><br>Following failed attempts to resolve differences with
Weyerhaeuser last month, two RAN activists were arrested for occupying
a model home at a Quadrant Homes housing development. Quadrant Homes, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser, builds its Washington homes
using Weyerhaeuser building materials traced to clear-cut logging
operations on Grassy Narrows land in northwest Ontario. After chaining
themselves to the roof, the activists unfurled a large banner that
read: “Weyerhaeuser: We’ll Leave Your Home When You Leave Ours.”<br><br>For more information, visit <a href="http:www.FreeGrassy.org" target="_new">www.FreeGrassy.org</a> or <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca" target="_new">www.amnesty.ca.</a><br>
