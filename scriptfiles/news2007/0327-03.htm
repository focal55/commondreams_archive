<p>WASHINGTON -- Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network (SLDN) today strongly condemned the anti-gay and racist
emails sent by Army Recruiter Sergeant Marcia Ramode to Corey Andrew, a
potential recruit. In her emails with Andrew, Ramode said, among other
things, that Andrew, an openly gay African American man, should "go back to
Africa and do your gay voodoo limbo tango and wango dance and jump around
and prance and run all over the place half naked there and practice your
gay morals over there..." SLDN demanded SGT Ramode's dismissal.
    <p>"Sergeant Ramode's comments were insulting and inflammatory to all
troops now serving in our armed forces," said C. Dixon Osburn, the group's
executive director. "Individuals from all racial, ethnic and religious
backgrounds, as well as those who are lesbian, gay and bisexual, serve in
our armed forces. This diversity not only reflects the diversity of our
nation, but it also strengthens the military might of our armed forces.
There is absolutely no place in our military for intolerance and bigotry."
    <p>In an email with SLDN, Douglas Smith, a public affairs officer for the
Recruiting Command, stated, "The matter has been referred through the U.S.
Army Recruiting Command's Staff Judge Advocate to the appropriate commander
for review, investigation and appropriate action. The Command expects its
Recruiters to conduct themselves in a professional manner in all dealings
with potential applicants and members of the public. We are ambassadors for
America's Army. I cannot comment further on this series of e-mail messages
at this time as it may interfere with the commander's investigation."
    <p>"We are encouraged that the U.S. Army Recruiting Command has taken the
emails seriously and look forward to the results of the investigation,"
said Osburn. "SLDN fully anticipates SGT Ramode's immediate dismissal."
