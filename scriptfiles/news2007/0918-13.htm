<p>WASHINGTON - September 18 - The spectacled eider’s winter feeding 
grounds in the Bering Sea are shrinking and changing because of global warming, 
which will likely lead to a food shortage for this already threatened sea duck, 
according to the tenth and final chapter of Defenders of Wildlife’s “Navigating 
the Arctic Meltdown” series.</p>
<p>The spectacled eider, named for its unmistakable 
white eye patches with black rims, is especially vulnerable to the warming 
temperatures in the Arctic. The entire world population gathers for the 
winter in a small area of the Bering Sea southwest of Alaska’s St. Lawrence Island. Several factors combine to 
create this unique section of the sea that provides the ideal haven for diving 
ducks. Sea currents and the river deltas that drain into the sea bring 
nutrient-rich water from, respectively, the North Pacific and the mainland, 
feeding a host of clams and other creatures on the sea floor that serve as the 
eider’s winter food. Strong winter winds that drive sea ice away from the coast 
create openings in the ice, allowing the ducks to dive for food. And 
persistently frigid waters discourage competition from fish for this rich food 
source. </p>
<p>However, global warming is now upsetting this 
delicate balance and threatening the spectacled eider’s winter stronghold by 
warming the water and attracting fish that compete with the eider for their 
limited winter food source. </p>
<p>“The spectacled eider’s American population was 
being decimated by lead poisoning, which resulted in the species being listed as 
threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1993,” said Jean Brennan, senior 
climate change scientist for Defenders of Wildlife. “Now the struggling American 
population, along with every other spectacled eider in the world, is facing 
additional peril because of the changes that global warming is creating in their 
feeding grounds and breeding habitats.”</p>
<p>Global warming also threatens to dry up the small 
ponds and wetlands that dot the Arctic coastal plain on 
Alaska’s north slope, on which the spectacled eider and 
many other bird species rely for breeding habitat. These vast areas of tundra 
wetland exist because of permafrost, the permanently frozen layer of ground that 
prevents water from draining away. As climate change accelerates the melting of 
permafrost, it is transforming the eider’s nesting habitat as wetlands give way 
to shrublands and forests. </p>
<p>"The changes to the Arctic caused by global warming are creating almost 
year-round problems for the spectacled eider. The breeding grounds they use in 
spring and summer are drying up. In the winter, they return to an altered 
seascape where much of their shellfish diet is being depleted by the fish that 
now flock to the warmer waters. This is all on top of their early autumn molting 
when eiders cannot fly, so they congregate in small areas where they are 
vulnerable to potential fuel spills and entanglement with fishing gear or 
floating trash,” said Brennan. </p>

<p>In its series on global warming and the 
Arctic, Defenders of Wildlife stresses the need to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a key to reducing the effects of global 
warming over the long term, both in the Arctic and worldwide. But in the meantime, immediate 
action 
must be taken to reduce the other pressures on species being negatively impacted 
by global warming, and to better understand what steps we can take to preserve 
Arctic animals and plants.</p>
<p>For the spectacled 
eider, much more research is needed into the birds and the ecology of their 
wintering grounds, which were only discovered in 1999. In particular, we need to 
find out more about how global warming is changing the Bering 
Sea and what those 
changes mean to the spectacled eider and other Arctic wildlife. 
</p>
<p>Second, protecting 
the eider while they are in their breeding habitat is key to helping them 
survive global warming. Experts believe that lead poisoning, contracted when 
ducks accidentally eat lead shot, caused the steep decline that led to the 
species’ listing under the Endangered Species Act. Lead shot was banned in 
waterfowl hunting in 1991 because of the devastating impacts it was having on 
ducks and geese nationwide. In the remote region of western Alaska where the 
eiders breed, this ban has been difficult to enforce, but wildlife and public 
health officials must continue their efforts and stress the impacts that lead 
shot has on wild birds, and on people who eat birds that have been killed with 
lead shot.</p>
<p>Finally, fishing and 
ship traffic should be curtailed in areas where molting birds are present. The 
spectacled eider gathers in large groups in tightly concentrated areas just off 
of the Alaskan and Siberian coast to molt, so any oil spill or other 
human-caused catastrophe in these areas would be devastating to the species, 
especially in light of the new threats that global warming presents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“While it may take 100 years or more to begin to 
reverse some of the harmful changes we’ve already caused to the Earth’s climate, 
it is our responsibility to step up our efforts to protect wildlife that is 
being affected by global warming today so our children and grandchildren will be 
able to enjoy wildlife tomorrow,” says Rodger Schlickeisen, president of 
Defenders of Wildlife.</p>

cod, Kittlitz’s murrelet, caribou, orange-crowned warbler, walrus and spectacled 
eider. </p>
