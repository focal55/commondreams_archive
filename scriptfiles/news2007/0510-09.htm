<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 10 -        Peace Action, the nation’s largest peace organization, is urging representatives in the House to vote yes today on a bill that would take most troops out of Iraq within nine months.
<P></P>The House of Representatives will vote today on Representative Jim McGovern’s (D-MA) HR 2237 which will start bringing our troops home in 90 days and will have all but a few tens of thousands of troops out of Iraq within 9 months.  A majority of peace groups are pushing for yes votes on the bill as is Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Out of Iraq Caucus.
<P></P>The House will also vote on supplemental funding for the Iraq war until July.  “The supplemental being proposed today will give the Bush administration another $40 billion free ride for its failed policy in Iraq.  It's time to stop funding the war and start funding our troops to come home,” said Kevin Martin, executive director of Peace Action, which is asking Representatives to vote against the supplemental today.
<P></P>Other provisions of HR 2237 would prohibit funding escalation of troops or any permanent military bases in Iraq.
<P></P>“The vast majority of Americans are tired of this failed occupation and want a time-lined withdrawal from Iraq.  HR 2237 will take nearly all of our troops out of Iraq within nine months. Of course, the president will likely threaten to veto this bill or anything else that challenges his miserably failed Iraq policies. If Bush continues to veto the will of the American people, Congress must stand firm and in fact ratchet up the pressure to bring our troops home as soon as possible,” concluded Martin.
