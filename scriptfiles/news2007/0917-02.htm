<p>NEW YORK - September 17 - The 
American Civil Liberties Union today submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to a 
Minnesota District Court urging it to allow Senator Larry Craig to withdraw his 
guilty plea because the secret sting operation used to arrest him was likely 
unconstitutional.&nbsp; </p>

<p>"The real motive behind secret sting operations like the one 
that resulted in Senator Craig’s arrest is not to stop people from inappropriate 
activity.&nbsp; It is to make as many arrests as possible – arrests that 
sometimes unconstitutionally trap innocent people," said Anthony Romero, 
Executive Director of the ACLU. "If the police really want to stop people from 
having sex in public bathrooms, they should put up a sign banning sex in the 
restroom and send in a uniformed officer to patrol periodically. That 
works."</p>
<p>In its brief, the ACLU argues that the government can arrest 
people for soliciting public sex only if it can show beyond doubt that the sex 
was to occur in public.&nbsp; Solicitation for private sex, regardless if it 
occurs in a bar or a restroom, is protected speech under the First 
Amendment.&nbsp; When free speech rights come into play, police enforcement 
actions must be "carefully crafted" so that they don’t unnecessarily ensnare 
people who are engaging in constitutionally protected speech.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The secret sting operation used by the police to arrest 
Senator Craig was not "carefully crafted" to avoid ensnaring innocent speech, 
says the ACLU.&nbsp; Alternatively, posting a sign that the restroom is being 
monitored is an effective means of deterring public sex without risking 
trampling on free speech rights and illegally trapping someone who might not 
intend to have sex in public in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, many law 
enforcement agencies, including the Minneapolis Police Department and the U.S. 
Department of Justice, recommend signs rather than secret sting operations as 
enforcement mechanisms.&nbsp;<br>(See:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/mime/open.pdf?Item=1460" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.cops.usdoj.gov/mime/open.pdf?Item=1460</a>)</p>

<p>"Senator Craig has not always been a great friend of civil 
liberties, but you shouldn’t have to endorse the civil liberties of others to 
keep your own," said Romero.&nbsp; "Government should make public restrooms safe 
for all, but it should do so in a manner that is really designed to stop 
inappropriate behavior, rather than destroying the lives of people who might 
have no intention of doing anything illegal." </p>
