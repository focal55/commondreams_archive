<p>  NEW YORK - October 1 – Farm Sanctuary,
North America's leading farm animal protection organization and
environmental group Global Action Network (GAN) are taking their fight
against foie gras to the federal level in Canada. Farm Sanctuary now has
undercover footage of horrifying abuses committed at three of the largest
foie gras production facilities in Canada. The sickening images captured
inside Palmex, Aux Champs D'Elise, and Elevages Perigord, demonstrate that
a culture of torture and abuse pervades the foie gras industry.
    <P></P>The most recent video from Aux Champs D'Elise includes the all too
familiar scenes of force feeding and rough handling but also reveals
shocking footage of a worker under the age of 18 cutting the head off a
live duck with a hunting knife.
    <P></P>"We are asking the Canadian Government to investigate the foie gras
industry and hold the industry, and the owners of these businesses
accountable for the rampant abuse which has been documented," said Gene
Baur, president of Farm Sanctuary. Farm Sanctuary and GAN have submitted
video evidence and expert testimony to the local authorities, the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency and the Department of Agriculture.
    <P></P>According to Andrew Plumbly, a director of Global Action Network, "Foie
gras production methods are inherently cruel and the existence of this
industry, that so obviously disregards animal welfare, debases and degrades
every Canadian. Canada needs to ban the production of foie gras now."
    <P></P>Male ducks and geese used in foie gras production in Canada are
de-billed, de-toed and forced to live in extreme confinement in filthy
cages. The female ducklings are discarded as trash, as their livers do not
grow at the same rate as the males. Nutritionally incomplete gruel is
pressure-pumped down the drakes' throats through a metal pipe several times
a day. This force feeding is known to cause bruising, lacerations, sores,
trauma, and even death. It also creates the grossly oversized and diseased
"fatty liver" for which foie gras is named. Gasping, regurgitating and
struggling to move, the birds endure this process every day at the end of
their short lives.
    <P></P>Seventy-two percent of the foie gras imported into the U.S. comes from
Canada. A leading distributor of foie gras in the United States is
D'Artagnan, owned by Ariane Daguin. Daguin is an active member of the
Artisan Farmer's Alliance, a group formed to promote foie gras consumption,
after laws were passed in California and Chicago to end the production and
sale of the notoriously cruel product.
    <P></P>Daguin continues to claim the foie gras D'Artagnan sells is "natural"
and produced by small sustainable family farms; that ducks are not abused,
and that the ducks' livers are not destroyed. Daguin's claims, while part
of a marketing campaign by the Artisan Farmer's Alliance, could not be
further from the truth. D'Artagnan's primary Canadian supplier is in fact
Palmex. Revealed in all its brutality in Farm Sanctuary's footage, Palmex
is a factory farm which holds thousands of birds, who are force fed to
produce the liver disease that gives foie gras its particular flavor.
Scientific evidence has also linked foie gras consumption with human health
risks.
    <P></P>Baur added, "We're not concerned about the outrageous claims Ms. Daguin
makes about the production of foie gras. She's economically dependent on
cruelty, and therefore not the most reliable source. We have science,
photographic evidence and public opinion on our side. Torture is torture,
and it must end."
