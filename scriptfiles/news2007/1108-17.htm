<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - Humanists see Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue's <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i4t5jEhhu6UbFKARr55RDXGPd3HgD8SPH86O0" target="_new">call for a rain
prayer</a> to be a divisive distraction from the work of government. While
leaders of some Georgia religious groups will pray together on Tuesday
outside the Georgia state capitol, the American Humanist Association will
continue to advance scientific solutions to such environmental
problems--solutions that humanists see as of value to all.
<P></P>
American Humanist Association executive director Roy Speckhardt explained,
"Our elected officials aren't being true to their oath of office when they
promote divisive political props like government organized prayer. Our
elected leaders have no business calling on people to express their beliefs
in one way over another, nor should public pronouncements of a governor give
his personal faith a privileged place over other worldviews."
<P></P>
Millions of Americans, including many Georgia citizens, don't see prayer as
an answer to any question, especially after the American Heart Journal last
year published the results of the most scientifically rigorous study of the
efficacy of prayer to date. That study concluded that prayer doesn't work.
<P></P>
"The governor should be doing the business of government instead of publicly
engaging in his personal religious practice," Speckhardt added.
<P></P>
Millions of Americans who retain faith in prayer see it as a private matter
and are offended by politicians' attempts to hijack their deeply held
religious beliefs to boost political poll numbers. In this regard, American
Humanist Association President Mel Lipman declared: "Not only does Gov.
Perdue's rain prayer event inappropriately endorse religious belief over
nonbelief, it inappropriately sets a standard for how religious people
should behave."
<P></P>
<em>The American Humanist Association (<a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org" target="_new">www.americanhumanist.org</a>) advocates for
the rights and viewpoints of humanists. Founded in 1941 and headquartered in
Washington, D.C., its work is extended through more than 100 local chapters
and affiliates across America.

<em>Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism, affirms
