<p>WASHINGTON - February 2 - ACORN members nationwide applauded the Senate’s first increase in the minimum wage over 10 years, saying it’s a step in the right direction, but expressed concern over attaching $9 billion in tax breaks. 
</p>
<p>The Senate voted 94-3 Thursday to boost the federal minimum wage by $2.10 to $7.25 an hour over two years, but packaged the increase with controversial tax cuts for small businesses and higher taxes for many $1 million-plus executives.
</p>
<p> “While we are thrilled this long-overdue increase is headed for final passage, we must still speak out against the bad policy and bad precedent set by this huge tax package,’’ said ACORN President Maude Hurd. “These tax breaks propose to fix a problem that doesn't exist: Minimum wage increases benefit workers and the economy and it is our hope that the House and Senate negotiate a final bill that raises the minimum wage without more of the endless corporate giveaways.’’ 
</p>
<p>The House approved a minimum wage bill on Jan. 10, which was rejected last week by Republican Senators who demanded that the measure include tax breaks. The Senate version now goes to the House, which has demanded that the tax breaks be stripped from the final bill before it lands on the president’s desk. 
</p>
<p>“Although we applaud Congress, we are not satisfied. We believe that $7.25 is not enough,’’ said ACORN Arkansas Chairman Maxine Nelson. “We intend to see this increase all the way through to the president’s desk and then get right back to the business of making the minimum wage a living wage.’’ 
</p>
<p>To support passage of a fair wage bill in Congress, ACORN members have been making phone calls to members of Congress, holding local events and lobbying at home and in Washington, D.C. Last month, ACORN organized a national sign on letter with its allies at the AFL-CIO that included over 600 groups urging Congress to immediately enact a clean minimum wage increase. 
</p>
<p>During a decade that saw Congress do nothing for low-wage workers, ACORN has been a national leader in the fight to raise wages at the local and state level. Since 1994, ACORN has spearheaded and supported dozens of living wage campaigns in cities and counties nationwide, helping deliver more than 140 local living wage laws. At the state level, ACORN and allies organized 11 successful state minimum wage campaigns last year alone – raising wages for nearly 5 million workers.
