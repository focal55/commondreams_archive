<p>Washington, DC —Environmental Defense today announced
the launch of a new national media campaign urging the U.S. Congress to
put a firm cap on carbon emissions, highlighting the need for an
economy-wide limit on global warming pollution to meet the climate
challenge.</p><p>Environmental Defense will run ads in major online
outlets across the country to underscore the need for a mandatory cap
on carbon. Scientific consensus says we need to reduce emissions by 60
to 80 percent by mid-century to avoid dangerous interference in the
climate, and only a cap can guarantee those results.</p><p>Alternatives
such as a tax on carbon do not guarantee emission reductions and could
stifle economic innovation, and proposals that do not account for
emissions from all economic sectors fail to get the job done.</p><p>“We’re
sending the message to the congressional leadership that small steps
won’t get us to where the science says we need to be. It might seem
easier, but there’s no safety valve in the science and no escape hatch
in the math,” <a href="http://www.environmentaldefense.org/page.cfm?tagID=905" target="_new"><font color="#0000ff">said Steve Cochran, national climate campaign director for Environmental Defense.</font></a></p>
<p>Pioneered
by Environmental Defense as an economically efficient way to control
sulfur dioxide emissions from electric utilities, a cap-and-trade
system for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would set a hard
limit on emissions and let businesses and the market find the best ways
to make reductions.</p><p>The cap-and-trade approach is the foundation
of several bills now pending in the Senate. It also is the goal of
business leaders ranging from the CEOs of major manufacturers and
utilities that have joined with Environmental Defense in the U.S.
Climate Action Partnership, to the heads of America’s big three car
companies and technology innovators and investors across the country.</p><p>The ads and more information on cap-and-trade can be found online at <a href="file://www.capcarbonpollution.org/" title="file://www.capcarbonpollution.org/" target="_new"><u title="file://www.capcarbonpollution.org/"><font title="file://www.capcarbonpollution.org/" color="#0000ff">www.capcarbonpollution.org</font></u></a>. </p>
