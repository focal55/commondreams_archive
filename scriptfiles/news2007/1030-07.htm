<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - This past weekend, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said he hasn’t seen any concrete evidence that there is a clandestine, secret nuclear weapons program under way in Iran.
<P></P>
“The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is disputing the Administration’s rush to judgment on Iran. He is reiterating that the Administration must listen and negotiate,” Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) said.
<P></P>
In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “Late Edition,” IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei, strongly advised the Bush Administration to tone down its rhetoric on Iran. He stated: “So we are not talking about Iran having today a nuclear weapon. We are trying to make sure that the future intention of Iran is peaceful, and that’s really what we are talking about. Risk assessment of possible future intention by Iran, if they have the technology to develop nuclear weapon. I say that because at this stage we need to continue to work through creative diplomacy. We have the time. Because I don’t see any other solution, Wolf, except through diplomacy and inspection.”
<P></P>
The Bush Administration has been busy this month ratcheting up the rhetoric to take us to war with Iran. President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Secretary of State Rice have all been making statements to convince the American public that a war with Iran is inevitable.
<P></P>
“The IAEA chief’s persistence and resolve to bring Iran into compliance is admirable. There is no military solution that brings a safer world. We need to change the collision course that we are on with Iran and enter into high-level diplomatic negotiations,” Kucinich said.
<P></P>
“Congress must exercise the power granted to it under the Constitution and rein in the President’s power. This county and this world cannot afford another war based on lies.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
