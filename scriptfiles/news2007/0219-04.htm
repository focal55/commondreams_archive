<p>NEW YORK - February 19 - Author, historian, and
human rights activist Howard Zinn, best known for his groundbreaking book A
People's History of the United States, will be joining photojournalist
Moises Saman, musician Fionn O Lochlainn, poet Michael Lally, and others in
a collaborative event with a clear message of peace and solidarity in
response to the human realities of war. This hopeful, inspiring, and humane
message will be experienced through the interlinked artistry of music,
poetry, photography, and literature. A Message of Peace echoes the language
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "...recognition of the
inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of
the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the
world."
<p>   Co-sponsored by Emergency, an organization that provides first quality
medical and surgical care free of charge in war torn areas, this event
creates a clear picture of the ravages of war and the potential for
progress. In March, Emergency will open a regional health care facility in
Sudan linked to clinics in the capital cities of all nine bordering
countries. This facility, the Salam Center (the name means "peace" in
Arabic) will bring new hope to people struggling to survive, heal, and
return to health amidst the terrible violence and suffering of the region.
It will also be the third largest green structure in the world.
<p>  To date, Emergency teams have successfully operated in some of the most
volatile regions in the world, including Iraq, Sudan, and particularly
Afghanistan, where their facilities have treated more than 20% of the
country's population. Emergency's efforts have been central to the peace
movement and have done much more than deliver relief medicine. Emergency
facilities provide on-site training for local health care staff and help
develop infrastructure in regions where health facilities, systems, and
programs have deteriorated.
<p> The event on February 20 will be held in the historic Great Hall of the
Cooper Union (East 7th St. at 3rd Ave., Manhattan), from 6:30 p.m.-8:30
p.m. Activist/musician Fionn O Lochlainn will open with a musical
performance to be followed by a poetry reading by Michael Lally from his
book, March 18, 2003: A Poem for Peace. The brilliant and powerful
photographic images taken by Moises Saman will be on display throughout the
evening. Howard Zinn will deliver the keynote address on the subject of a
"just" war. Following Zinn's presentation, the speakers will join in a
panel discussion followed by a conversation with the audience. Dr. Richard
Keeling, a member of the Board of Directors of Emergency USA whose work
links health and education, will serve as moderator for the event. A book
signing will conclude the evening.
<p>  CHARTA, an international publishing company that has become a growing
voice of humanitarian concern, is cosponsor of the event. The company has
published books by Howard Zinn, Moises Saman, Michael Lally, and even
Emergency's founder, the distinguished war surgeon Dr. Gino Strada.
