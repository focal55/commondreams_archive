<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 7 - Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), in conjunction with a coalition of government watchdog groups, is launching a new online government document database, governmentdocs.org, at a tele-news conference, tomorrow, Thursday, November 8 at 11:00 AM.<strong> The call-in number is 866.211.5938.</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>The database will house Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) responses, and other government documents, from a number of organizations, that can be browsed, searched and reviewed. It is the only one of its kind.</p>
<p> As of today, organizations including CREW, Project on Government Oversight, Public Citizen, Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation have contributed documents to the site. The goal of the database is to create a central repository of government documents, promoting greater transparency into the inner-workings of our government.</p>
<p> Traditionally, government watchdog groups have either posted FOIA documents on their websites as unsearchable PDFs, or statically highlighted several pages within a document to bolster their findings. This has historically limited the public's access to FOIA documents, and minimizes the opportunities for use by researchers, journalists and citizen reviewers for further research and disclosures. Governmentdocs.org changes that:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;">
<li class="MsoNormal last">Each      and every document goes through an optical character recognition (OCR)      process, so that the text of each document is entirely      searchable.    </li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;">
<li class="MsoNormal last">A      powerful search engine provides full-text searches and hit highlighting. </li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-top: 0in;">
<li class="MsoNormal last">Citizen      reviewers can add information to each document page and highlight      important findings, allowing for more robust and targeted searches.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;">
<li class="MsoNormal last">Every      page of every document has its own unique URL so that documents can be      linked, shared, or posted onto websites.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;">
<li class="MsoNormal last">The      database is a coalition effort, so all of the organizations’ documents      will be housed on governmentdocs.org and searches will work across      collections. </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Sunlight Foundation generously supported the creation of the site.
