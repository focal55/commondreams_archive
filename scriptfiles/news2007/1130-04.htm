<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - 			Former Congressman Tom Andrews, National Director of the Win Without War coalition, released the following statement today on President Bush’s latest attempt to intimidate Congress on Iraq:

 <P></P>

“President Bush is once again playing his fear and manipulation card in a desperate move to intimidate Congress into handing him a $196 billion blank check to continue a failed strategy in Iraq.  Congress must not be fooled by the President’s rhetoric which is nothing more than the latest in a long line of misleading and false statements this President has made about the war.

 <P></P>

“The President’s threats to start layoffs at the Defense Department and military bases around the country – after the Congress awarded him the largest defense budget in American history – does not pass the straight face test. The fact that the Commander and Chief used the Pentagon for political theater and the military as a political ploy is nothing short of shameful.
<P></P>
 

“The failure of the Administration’s Iraq policy to foster political reconciliation in Iraq is now threatening to unleash a new wave of violence with our soldiers once again in the crossfire. As published reports today indicate, the lack of a plan to absorb returning refugees back into Iraqi communities is about to fuel another wave of violence. The soldiers, who have been asked to sacrifice everything to give politicians in Washington and Baghdad time to achieve political stability, are suffering the grave consequence of President Bush’s failure.  
<P></P>
 

“The President claimed yesterday that ‘The American people do not want the government to create needless uncertainty for those defending our country.’ He is exactly right. The Congress owes our soldiers in Iraq and the people they represent certainty that the endless war strategy of the president is over and will be replaced by a plan to end the war and bring our troops home quickly and safely.  It is unacceptable to continue to demand that our brave men and women in uniform be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the failures of politicians in Washington and Baghdad.  

 <P></P>

“Congress must reject the President’s latest budget busting war funding bill and act quickly to end the war in Iraq.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
