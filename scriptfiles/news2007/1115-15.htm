<p>BALTIMORE - November 15 -  <br>
<br>
<b>WHO:</b> The Iraq Pledge of Resistance was formed for individuals willing to engage in nonviolent civil resistance to first prevent and later to protest the war in Iraq. It is has been renamed the National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance [NCNR].

 <p></p>

Pledge activists have repeatedly risked arrest to protest the war with Iraq.  On September 26 & 27, 2006, for example, they joined with activists from around the country in protests organized by the Declaration of Peace aimed at urging Congress to cut off funding for the war in Iraq.  In response, religious and secular peace activists were denied access to their legislators and arrested on Capitol Hill.  The 71 peace activists arrested on Sept. 26 were charged with either “crossing a police line” or “unlawful assembly.”  The 26 citizens who were arrested outside the Rayburn House Office Building on Sept. 27 were charged with “unlawful assembly.”
 <p></p>
 

<b>WHAT:</b>  The defendants were either prosecuted in a trial which concluded on February 16, 2007 or on March 14, 2007.  Both trials were conducted by Chief Judge Rufus King III, and all but one protester were convicted and sentenced to pay a $50 assessment fee.  Eleven defendants, including Maria Allwine, Michelle Grise, Joan Nicholson and Max Obuszewski, wrote letters to the judge to inform him that in good conscience they would not pay the fee. They felt they were unjustly convicted, and paying the fee would be an admission of guilt. On May 11, King held the activists in contempt, and was prepared to jail them.  However, once he was apprised of the law, he moved the case for a status hearing before Associate Judge John Ramsey Johnson.

  <p></p>

Since then Allwine, Grise, Nicholson and Obuszewski have appeared before Johnson twice to discuss the case.  There is to be a third status hearing.
  <p></p>

<b>WHEN:</b>  Friday, November 16, 2007 at 2 PM

  <p></p>

<b>WHERE:</b>  Courtroom 319, District of Columbia Superior Court, 500 Indiana Ave., NW, Washington, DC
 <p></p>
 

<b>WHY:</b>  The government has argued that the defendants should be jailed.  The defendants, with their attorneys John Briley, Mark Goldstone and Steve Polin, have requested a dismissal of the contempt charge.  If the case is not dismissed, the defendants have argued that since they are facing a year in jail they have a right to a jury trial.  It seems the only witness for the prosecution would be Judge Rufus King III.  Has a sitting judge in Superior Court ever been a witness in a criminal proceeding?

  <p></p>

Another matter of concern to the defendants is the behavior of courtroom officials.  Prior to the hearing on August 24, a court clerk became belligerent towards the defendants.  When Obuszewski questioned the clerk’s behavior, the marshal interceded and told him to sit down.  Instead he departed from the courtroom.  However, Allwine informed the marshal that his behavior was out of line.  Soon thereafter, some ten marshals entered the courtroom and ejected her from the courthouse.

  <p></p>

When the status hearing was about to begin, Judge Johnson ordered her to be allowed to return to the courtroom.  The hearing then commenced.

  <p></p>

Both Allwine and Obuszewski wrote letters of complaint to the judge, but they did not receive a response.  It remains to be seen if this matter will be addressed during the status hearing.

  <p></p>

Some of the defendants have appealed the original conviction on the grounds that their First Amendment rights were denied by the Capitol Police in 2006.  It is presumed that Judge Johnson will delay any decision in the contempt case until the appeal is resolved.

  <p></p>

The four defendants have continued to protest the war.  Most recently, they were arrested in the Crypt of the U.S. Capitol on September 20, 2007 and are scheduled for trial in Superior Court, with 32 other antiwar activists, on January 16, 2008, facing two disorderly conduct charges.
