<p>  NEW MEXICO - October 3 – Three city governments in the United States are trying to stop Food Not
Bombs from publicly feeding the hungry and working for peace.  Food Not
Bombs volunteer Eric Montanez will go on trial this week for feeding
more than 24 people at Lake Eola in Orlando, Florida. Food Not Bombs
groups in West Palm Beach, Florida and Albuquerque, New Mexico will
risk arrest this weekend. New Mexico ranks as America's hungriest state
with over 16.5 % of its people going without food each month. Food Not
Bombs is not  only providing free healthy meals to the hungry in over
1,000 cities across the globe but the all volunteer movement is also
working to stop the U.S. attacks on Iran and an end to the wars in
Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine.  <br>
<br>
On Friday, October 5th Food Not Bombs
cofounder Keith McHenry will be speaking at Immanuel Presbyterian
Church in Albuquerque.  He will talk about Amnesty International's work
to defend Food Not Bombs.  Keith faced life in prison for his work
feeding the hungry in California and Amnesty International worked for
is freedom. Keith spent over 500 days in jail for feeding the hungry
according to the San Francisco DA's office. Amnesty International has
declared Food Not Bombs volunteers "Prisoners of Conscience" if
convicted for their work. For more information on each case please read
below.
