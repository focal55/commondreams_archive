<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - MAY 24 - Rachel Carson's 100th birthday is being celebrated this Sunday, 
  May 27. Carson is widely credited with ushering in a new age of environmental 
  consciousness with the publication of her book, Silent Spring, in 1962. The 
  book alerted the world to the dangers of DDT, dieldrin, and other persistent 
  organochlorine pesticides that were responsible for the deaths and reproductive 
  failures of raptors, seabirds, herons, and songbirds. Ten years later, following 
  the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency, those chemicals were banned. 
</p>
<p>"Thanks to Rachel Carson, endangered bird species in the United States 
  have recovered, including the Bald Eagle, Brown Pelican, Peregrine Falcon, and 
  Osprey," said Dr. Michael Fry, Director of American Bird Conservancy's 
  Pesticides and Birds Campaign. "But there is more to be done; millions 
  of birds are still being poisoned each year. ABC is committed to continuing 
  the great work begun by Rachel Carson and others to ensure that all America's 
  birds are safeguarded against dangerous pesticides."</p>
<p>The highly toxic and persistent "first generation" insecticides have 
  mostly now been superseded by newer generations of reduced risk chemicals. But 
  despite these gains, birds are still being poisoned. One estimate by Pimentel 
  &amp;Acquay suggests that more than 670 million birds are directly exposed to 
  pesticides each year on U.S. farms alone, 10% of which - or 67 million birds 
  - die as a result.</p>
<p>ABC's Avian Incident Monitoring System (AIMS) documents more than 2,500 cases 
  of pesticide-caused bird deaths in the past 40 years, representing more than 
  400,000 individual dead birds, and involving more than 100 different pesticides. 
  This is a small percentage of the total number of bird poisonings since most 
  incidents are never reported. </p>
<p>The Breeding Bird Survey has documented that over two hundred of the 654 bird 
  species in the United States are still in decline. While habitat loss and fragmentation 
  is likely the biggest cause, continued use of toxic chemicals still plays a 
  significant role.</p>

<p>Since 1996, ABC's <a href="http://www.abcbirds.org/pesticides/" target="_new">Pesticides 
  and Birds Campaign</a> has played a leading role in getting the most hazardous 
  pesticides to birds removed from the marketplace. Of the 25 worst pesticides 
  in terms of bird deaths, 17 have now been banned or are currently in the process 
  of being cancelled or strictly regulated (as indicated by black or white Xs 
  on the graph). ABC led in the withdrawal, restriction, or proposed cancellation 
  of many of these, including fenthion, which posed a hazard to endangered Piping 
  Plovers in Florida, carbofuran, brodifacoum, bromodialone, zinc phosphate, and 
  monocrotophos for international use. </p>
<p>"Recently, carbofuran was recommended to be canceled by the EPA following 
  a campaign by ABC and other members of the National Pesticide Reform Coalition, 
  and the coalition is pressing for the cancellation of aldicarb," said Dr. 
  Fry. "Diazinon now stands out as the most dangerous prominent pesticide 
  to watch."</p>
<p>Diazinon and aminopyridine are now ABC's top targets for regulation or cancellation. 
  Many of the household uses of diazinon were canceled in 2001 because of storm 
  water contamination and water quality issues in California, an action also supported 
  by ABC. However, agricultural and other lawn uses still kill many waterfowl 
  and ground-feeding birds. </p>
