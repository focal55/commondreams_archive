<p>BELGUIM, UK, THE NETHERLANDS - May 8 -Complaints are being filed today, May 8, in three
European  countries against a shameless advert that makes exaggerated
and  misleading green claims about oil giant Shell’s operations.</p>
<p>Friends of the Earth International is filing simultaneous
complaints to the national advertising standards authorities of
Belgium, the  Netherlands, and the UK about Shell’s advert which
depicts the outline of an oil refinery emitting flowers rather than
smoke and claims that it  uses its “waste CO2 to grow flowers and
[its] waste sulphur to make concrete”[1].</p>
<p>Friends of the Earth International is objecting to the overall
message and imagery used. The advert says ‘Don’t throw anything
away, there is no away’ - which may be true, but the implication
that Shell carries out its operations in line with this is false and
misleading.</p>
<p>Shell’s advert is also misleading because it suggests that Shell
uses all of its waste CO2 to grow flowers while in reality it uses
less than 0.5 percent of it to grow flowers.</p>
<p>Shell boasts that at a refinery in the Netherlands, CO2 is piped
to heat greenhouses, saving 350,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.
This is only 0.325 per cent of Shell’s direct emissions. According
to Shell’s own figures, it emitted 100 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide in 2005 [2]</p>
<p>Paul de Clerck , Friends of the Earth International’s Corporates
Campaigner said:</p>
<p>“Shell is one of the world’s dirtiest companies. People living
next door to Shell’s refineries around the world can vouch for
that. Shell should spend money cleaning up its mess, not on deceiving
the public with expensive, dishonest adverts. We hope that the
advertising standard authorities will take immediate action to
withdraw the advert and order Shell to air a correction to the
audiences reached with the misleading advert.”</p>
<p>There are people suffering from the effects of the pollution
emitted by Shell’s refineries in Nigeria, South Africa, the US and
the Philippines, among others.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Shell wastes gas, a by product of oil, by flaring it,
despite having been ordered to stop by the Nigerian High Court.
Shell’s illegal flares emit sulphur which causes acid rain and
devastates the environment and corrodes people’s homes.</p>
<p>In Durban (South Africa), for example, Shell emits 7,300 tonnes of
sulphur dioxide a year, much of which it could recover and reuse.
People living near Shell’s refinery suffer from high rates of
asthma and respiratory diseases, thought to be caused as a result of
breathing in high levels of sulphur dioxide.</p>
