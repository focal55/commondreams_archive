<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - Momentum continued to grow today for Congress to dramatically improve global warming legislation being considered in the Senate.
<P></P>
 

As the cap-and-trade bill, sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and John Warner (R-Va.), moved through a Senate subcommittee, Democratic Presidential Candidate John Edwards <a href="http://johnedwards.com/news/headlines/20071101-global-warming-legislation/" target="_new">called on the Senate</a> to do better, saying “The critical question is simple: are we going to do everything climate science says is needed to save our planet? The Lieberman-Warner bill says no.”  He also criticized the legislation’s massive corporate giveaways.

 
<P></P>
Edwards’ call matches action taken earlier this week by MoveOn.org, which sent an e-mail to its massive list saying, “The bill won't solve global warming, but it will give polluting companies billions in windfall profits.”  A link to MoveOn.org’s petition is available <a href="http://pol.moveon.org/pac/nofreeride/" target="_new">here</a>.

 <P></P>

In the Senate, champions such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) and Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) are pushing for stronger legislation.

 <P></P>

And just yesterday a group of more than 30 national and grassroots environmental leaders including Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder sent <a href="http://www.foe.org/globalwarming/Group_Lieberman-Warner_Letter.pdf" target="_new">a letter</a> to members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee stating their concern that “the legislation falls far short of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the amount current science says is needed” and that the bill is “likely to give hundreds of billions of … windfall profits to polluters.”

 
<P></P>
“The Lieberman-Warner bill does not achieve what science says is needed, and it provides massive giveaways to corporate polluters,” said Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder.  “We are pleased to see that there is growing grassroots momentum behind our demand that the Senate do better—and that progressive leaders including John Edwards and MoveOn.org are leading the way.”

 
<P></P>
Friends of the Earth Action is e-mailing its activists today to ask them to encourage other presidential campaigns to take a strong stand on Lieberman-Warner.  Friends of the Earth has been calling attention to weaknesses in the Lieberman-Warner legislation since a draft of the bill was introduced in August.  A one-page Friends of the Earth summary of the flaws in the bill is available <a href="http://www.foe.org/globalwarming/Lieberman-Warner_overview.pdf" target="_new">here</a>, and a longer analysis of the bill’s giveaways to corporate polluters is available <a href="http://www.foe.org/globalwarming/Lieberman-Warner_giveaways_analysis.pdf" target="_new">here</a>.<!-- #EndEditable -->
