<p>NEW YORK - May 16 - As the United Nations wraps up its two-year discussion about climate change, energy, air pollution and industrial development, many are dissatisfied with the outcomes, described by both NGOs and government delegates as “weak.” Citizen groups from around the US, participating in the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, which ended its two-year discussion about sustainable energy last Friday, agreed it is time for the US government to acknowledge its responsibility to take immediate and comprehensive action.
 
<P></P>Reflecting deepening concerns about climate change and other impacts of fossil fuel addiction on both industrialized and developing countries, many are especially unhappy with the minimal response by the United States, a country producing one-quarter of the world’s carbon emissions and consuming one-quarter of the energy.
 
<P></P>According to a joint statement released by the Working Group on Energy and Climate Change of the Citizens Network for Sustainable Development, citizens, business and government in the United States need to dramatically “transform the ways we produce and consume energy in our individual households, communities, regions and nation.”
 
<P></P>To become more responsible, the groups call for change at all levels of US society:
  
<P></P>For individuals to inform and educate themselves about the impacts of their energy choices and to take personal and household action to reduce their harmful impacts. 
<P></P>For states and local communities to develop sustainable energy policies, plans and targets to significantly reduce harmful pollution and emissions. 
<P></P>For the United States government to develop and implement a National Sustainable Energy Strategy that will greatly reduce and end the harmful impacts of our fossil-fuel economy on the world's climate and communities. 
 
<P></P>National, state and local strategies should, the US groups said, “involve full participation of the American public in a national dialogue” on the country’s sustainable energy future.
 
<P></P>For a full copy of the statement, <a href="http://citnet.org/wg/energyclimate/documents/USCitizensStatementonEnergyClimate3.doc" target="_new"><i>The Responsibility of US Citizens on Energy and Climate Change</i></a> can be found on the <a href="http://citnet.org/" target="_new">Citizens Network for Sustainable Development</a> website.

<P></P>The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development is a national, voluntary network of organizations and individuals committed to building the movement for sustainable development in the United States and beyond. Advocacy and educational activities on specific issues take place through working groups, which are responsible for the views and ideas promoted.
