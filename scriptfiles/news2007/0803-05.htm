<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 3 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) called the Administration’s latest Middle East policy reckless and dangerous and said it would further hurt the United States’ standing in the region and the world. <br><br>Yesterday, President Bush issued an Executive Order, announcing the United States faced an ‘Unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy’ and will freeze the property and interests of people deemed by the Administration to be undermining Lebanon’s democratic government. <br><br>“The French are working in Lebanon to try to construct a national unity government. Syria is on record as supporting the French initiative. The Bush Administration is trying to block National Unity and continue with its strategy to destabilize the region by targeting Syria and Iran, instead of seeking diplomatic resolution. The Administration is using the same rhetoric and political posturing that led to the unjustified war against Iraq. Our nation cannot afford this dangerous and aggressive foreign policy. The Administration’s posturing is putting the United States on a path of escalation with both Syria and Iran,” Kucinich said. <br><br>“If the Administration continues these policies which undermine the sovereignty of Syria and Lebanon, the United States risks more violence in the Middle East, further isolation from the international community, and the continued sacrifice of our pressing domestic needs.&nbsp; Instead of seeking to generate more turmoil, President Bush needs to commit U.S. diplomats to multiparty negotiations in the Middle East with no preconditions to achieve lasting peace in the region.”<br><br>Congressman Kucinich and his wife, Elizabeth, visited Lebanon last summer in the wake of Israel’s bombing of South Lebanon. Their mission included traveling around the war-torn country where they met with government leaders and citizens in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Palestine in the hopes of generating support for peace. <br>
