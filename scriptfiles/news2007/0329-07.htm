San Francisco - This week, hundreds of responsible investors in
Canada and the United States began receiving letters from Rainforest
Action Network detailing the extent of Weyerhaeuser Corporation’s
(NYSE:WY) environmental and human rights violations. 
<p> The letters request that responsible investors “engage with
Weyerhaeuser over the rights and interests of the Grassy Narrows First
Nation in northwestern Ontario, and their refusal to adopt the Forest
Stewardship Council’s certification standards.” The letters endorse a
shareholder resolution filed by Capital Strategies Consulting, Inc.,
requesting “a feasibility assessment to suspend wood procurement from
Grassy Narrows’ territory until the free, prior, and informed consent
of the community has been established.” The resolution contends that
Weyerhaeuser’s ongoing procurement of wood from Grassy Narrows’
territory is an unnecessary violation of internationally recognized
human rights and established industry best practices. Independent
research shows that the Ontario Province could respect Grassy Narrows'
call for a moratorium on non-consensual logging without sacrificing
jobs by re-directing unused hardwood supplies from other less
controversial regional forests to Weyerhaeuser’s Timberstand mill in
Kenora, Ontario. </p>
<p> At issue is Weyerhaeuser’s procurement from clear-cut logging done
without consent on Grassy Narrows traditional territory. Weyerhaeuser
is the sole purchaser of hardwood from Grassy Narrows territory each
year, making it the largest purchaser of wood from the contested area.
Canadian logging company Abitibi Consolidated currently holds logging
rights to Grassy Narrows territory granted by the Ontario government.
Grassy Narrows contests these licenses as a violation of their
Indigenous rights under Treaty 3. Treaty 3 stipulates that Indigenous
people have the right to use their land for traditional practices such
as hunting, trapping, and fishing- all of which are threatened in
Grassy Narrows because of the continued clear-cut logging. </p>
<p> Amnesty International Canada has also sent letters to investors,
outlining their concerns about the company’s human rights practices
with regard to the Grassy Narrows First Nation, citing that: “Amnesty
International believes that all companies share a responsibility to
promote and protect human rights within their operations. As a North
American business leader, Weyerhaeuser has an obligation to respect the
human rights of First Nations communities in those areas where it
conducts business. The company should not proceed unless appropriate
consultations have indicated that the community has given its free,
prior informed consent. Failure to do so exposes investors to potential
risk. Amnesty Canada urges Weyerhaeuser to vote in favour of this
resolution at the upcoming AGM and to recommend this action to its
shareholders.” </p>

<p> “Calvert is deeply concerned by the ongoing dispute between Grassy
Narrows, the government of Ontario, and forest products companies
including Weyerhaeuser,” said Stu Dalheim, manager of advocacy and
policy for the mutual fund company. “Through our dialogue with the
company we are calling upon Weyerhaeuser to stop sourcing wood from
Grassy Narrow’s traditional territory until the community provides its
free prior informed consent.” </p>
<p> “Most people recognize that clear-cut logging on Indigenous land is
bad for human rights and the environment, but the business case against
these destructive practices is just as clear.” said Brant Olson, Old
Growth campaign director at Rainforest Action Network. “Steve Rogel has
a duty to inform investors about the risks associated with relying on
clear-cut logging in Grassy Narrows and a responsibility to pursue less
ecologically and socially damaging alternatives.” </p>
