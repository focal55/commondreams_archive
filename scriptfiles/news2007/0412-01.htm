<p>			In the aftermath of the racial outburst that got talkshow host Don Imus' dropped from <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span>--referring to the Rutgers women's basketball team as "nappy-headed hos"-- a <span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span> editorial (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/09/AR2007040901105.html" title="">4/10/07</a>)
posed a question many critics have been asking for years: How do
prestigious journalists defend their cozy relationship with a
well-known bigot?<br>
<br>
As the <span class="media_outlet">Post</span> put it: "But those
who bask in the glow of his radio show ought to consider whether they
should continue doing so. After all, you're judged by the company you
keep." Since discovering Imus' long record of bigotry, misogyny and
homophobia is not difficult (<span class="media_outlet">Slate</span>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2163872" title="">4/10/07</a>), it's a question reporters should have been asking long ago—FAIR posed the very same question to <span class="media_outlet">NBC</span>'s Tim Russert six years ago, for example (Action Alert, <a href="index.php?page=1751" title="Why Does Tim Russert Associate With Don Imus' Bigotry?">3/1/00</a>). <br>

<br>
When journalist Phil Nobile (<span class="media_outlet">TomPaine.com</span>,
6/28/01) presented many top pundits with evidence of Imus' bigotry, few
(of the white ones, anyway) seemed to think what Imus was saying should
affect their decisions to appear on his program. Nobile noted that <span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span> reporter Howard Kurtz wrote in his 1996 book <i>Hot Air</i> that "Imus's sexist, homophobic and politically incorrect routines echo what many journalists joke about in private."<br>
<br>
Really? Do Washington journalists really call people "thieving
Jews"--and then make mock apologies, saying that the phrase is
"redundant" (<span class="media_outlet">Imus in the Morning</span>,
12/15/04)? Did they really call Clinton's attorney general "old Bigfoot
shaky Janet Reno," taunting her for her Parkinson's disease (<span class="media_outlet">Imus in the Morning</span>, <a target="_blank" href="http://tompaine.com/Archive/scontent/4389.html" title="">6/12/01</a>)?  Do they really laugh uproariously at the news of hundreds of Haitians drowning (<span class="media_outlet">Imus in the Morning</span>, <a target="_blank" href="http://tompaine.com/Archive/scontent/3067.html" title="">3/20-24/00</a>)? If so, Kurtz has been sitting on a great many scoops.<br>

<br>
Whatever their private conversations, many pundits are now being forced
to answer questions about their associations with Imus, and those
answers are worth documenting. Appearing on the <span class="media_outlet">Imus in the Morning</span> show on April 9, <span class="media_outlet">Newsweek</span>'s Howard Fineman explained:<br>
<br>
<div class="sideindent">You know, it's a different time, Imus. You
know, it's different than it was even a few years ago, politically....
And some of the stuff that you used to do, you probably can't do
anymore.... You just can't. Because the times have changed. I mean,
just looking specifically at the African-American situation. I mean,
hello, Barack Obama's got twice the number of contributors as anybody
else in the race.... I mean, you know, things have changed. And the
kind of—some of the kind of humor that you used to do you can't do
anymore. And that's just the way it is.</div><br>
<br>
Fineman's suggestion, clearly, is that Imus' brand of racism was
acceptable not too long ago— at least before Barack Obama was able to
raise significant campaign donations.<br>
<br>
On <span class="media_outlet">PBS</span>'s <span class="media_outlet">NewsHour With Jim Lehrer</span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june07/imus_04-09.html" title="">4/9/07</a>), <span class="media_outlet">Boston Globe</span> columnist Tom Oliphant rejected the notion that appearing with Imus gave some form of cover to his bigotry: <br>

<br>
<div class="sideindent">I don't consider myself an enabler. But I
recognize--and one reason I feel that it's possible to be this tough on
him is that I think he understands that those of us from politics and
public affairs and whatever who work with him are going to be seen as
enabling. And if that's the case, then his conduct is of interest to me
as much as it is to you.</div><br>
<br>
Those words stand in contrast with what Oliphant said on Imus' show that <a target="_blank" href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200704090007" title="">very morning</a>: <br>
<br>
<div class="sideindent">The train went off the tracks, which, you know,
can happen to anybody. And, of course, what counts when the train goes
off the tracks is what you then do.... Those of us... who know better,
have a moral obligation to stand up and say to you, "Solidarity
forever, pal."</div>  <br>
<br>
That's not enabling?<br>
<br>
Other media defenders point out that Imus does charity work, as if this gives him more room to be a racist. As <span class="media_outlet">USA Today</span>'s Peter Johnson noted (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-04-09-imus-analysis_N.htm" title="">4/10/07</a>),
"His politically incorrect satire has been tempered by an intellectual
and considerate side: He runs a camp for sick kids, cares about
politics and has an eye for books that can catapult them onto the
best-seller list." (As the <span class="media_outlet">Wall Street Journal</span>

has pointed out—3/24/05—Imus' ranch spends $3,000 a night to host each
child; other organizations that do similar work spend about one-tenth
as much.)<br>
<br>
Appearing on the <span class="media_outlet">CBS</span> <span class="media_outlet">Early Show</span> (4/10/07), <span class="media_outlet">CNN</span>
host Lou Dobbs said much the same. While calling Imus' remarks
"inexcusable," Dobbs went to offer what sounded very much like an
excuse: <br>
<br>
<div class="sideindent">These calls for his resignation, frankly, in my
opinion, this is a man you have to take into account. He does more
public service, works with kids, he is an absolutely exemplary person
in terms of his humanitarianism. And those who suggest you can't take
into account the broader man for these, as I say, ignorant and
inexcusable remarks, I don't think is adequate.</div><br>
<br>

<span class="media_outlet">NBC</span> reporter David Gregory (<span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span>,
4/9/07) stressed that "Imus is a good man," and that "this is a
difficult time, not just because of the hurt that he has inflicted and
what he said, as he tries to deal with it, but for all of us who are on
the program and certainly don't want to be associated with this kind of
thing that he's done, as all of this plays out." Gregory apparently
wasn't so bothered with his association with Imus before this latest
controversy.<br>
<br>
Others made it seem as if deciding not to appear on the Imus show would be a problem. <span class="media_outlet">Newsweek</span> editor Evan Thomas told the <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/business/media/09carr.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" title="">4/9/07</a>),
"He should not have said what he said, obviously. I am going on the
show, though. I think if I didn't, it would be posturing." To which the
<span class="media_outlet">Charlotte Observer</span> editorialized (4/10/07), "Which raises this question for Mr. Thomas: What posture would that be--upright?"<br>

<br>
In a <span class="media_outlet">Los Angeles Times</span> report (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-na-imus11apr11,0,831641.story" title="">4/11/07</a>), some Imus guests appeared to have second thoughts about their silence. <span class="media_outlet">CBS</span>
reporter Jeff Greenfield said, "That's something people like me should
have challenged him on." (Greenfield, to his partial credit, did try to
raise the issue when he interviewed Imus on <span class="media_outlet">Larry King Live</span>--<a target="_blank" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/24/lkl.00.html" title="">2/24/00</a>.)<br>
<br>
Others, meanwhile, seem to think Imus really means it when he says he's sorry. <span class="media_outlet">CBS</span>

host Bob Schieffer condemned Imus' remarks, but "said he would probably
go on Imus' show again, noting that they had been friends for 15
years." The <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> quoted Schieffer:
"There's probably a good lesson for all of us in this. We all need to
refocus and be sensitive to these things. Maybe sometimes he's gone too
far and some of us really haven't been paying attention." <span class="media_outlet">Newsweek</span> editor Jon Meacham (<span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span>,
4/11/07) said: "We don't want to rush to judgment.... Imus appears
genuine about changing the tone, but if there's any backsliding, then
it's over as far as we're concerned." <br>
<br>
Pundits making such assessments might consider that this was not the
first time Imus has appeared to sound contrite about his words, so it's
hard to know why to believe him this time around. In a recent <span class="media_outlet">Vanity Fair</span> profile (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/02/imus200602?currentPage=1" title="">2/06</a>),
Imus said: "I regret the times I've been mean to people.… It's fine to
pick on people who can defend themselves and deserve it. Some people
don't deserve to be picked on who I picked on, so I don't do it
anymore."<br>

<br>
He made a similar pledge on his show years earlier (<a target="_blank" href="http://tompaine.com/Archive/scontent/3083.html" title="">3/4/00</a>): <br>
<br>
<div class="sideindent">There's no reason to hurt people's feelings. In
some cases I have, and I'm not going to do it anymore. I get accused of
being a racist all the time, but I'm not. I realize that we do things
here that are misconstrued and frankly I regret it. People have
criticized me and they're right.</div><br>
<br>
Given Imus' repeatedly violated vows to rein in his racist schtick, one
has to look to his pundit friends—his enablers—to show more resolve.
Unfortunately, given their co-dependent relationship with the talk
host, such resolve is unlikely. As <span class="media_outlet">Newsweek</span>'s Fineman put it (<span class="media_outlet">Imus in the Morning</span>,
4/9/07): "You know, all of us who do your show, you know, we're part of
the gang. And we rely on you the way you rely on us."
