<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 25 - Today, <i>Media Matters for America</i> called on the Public Broadcasting
Service to reconsider its decision to have discredited Republican pollster and
strategist Frank Luntz participate in the coverage of its June 28 Democratic
presidential candidates' forum. As a partisan Republican, Luntz has shown
open disdain for Democratic priorities and candidates and has a long record of
being criticized by his peers for misrepresenting polling data and methodology.

</p>

<p>In September 2004, MSNBC dropped Luntz from its planned coverage of
that year's presidential debate, following a letter from <i>Media Matters</i> that outlined Luntz's
Republican ties and questionable polling methodology. </p>

<p>Today, <i>Media Matters</i> sent
a letter to PBS urging the broadcast service to reconsider its decision to
include Luntz. Some excerpts from the letter are included below and followed by
the letter in full:</p>

<p>"In keeping with the Public Broadcasting
Service's long and distinguished history of journalistic integrity, we at
Media Matters for America
are writing to ask that you reconsider your network's decision to have
Republican pollster Frank Luntz take part in coverage of PBS' June 28
Democratic presidential forum.</p>

<p>"According to an April 4 PBS press release,
Luntz will participate in coverage of the June 28 candidate forum, which will be
televised live and moderated by PBS host Tavis Smiley. In fact, the release
states that '[i]mmediate public feedback on the performance of the
candidates will be conducted by noted pollster Frank Luntz, who will also
appear on "Tavis Smiley" on PBS the following evening to discuss
his findings.'</p>

<p>"While we recognize the importance of analyzing
the performance of the Democratic field, it is unconscionable that someone with
Luntz's partisan history, open disdain for Democratic priorities and
candidates, and record of reported reprimand and censure by his peers would be
chosen by PBS for such an important role in a Democratic presidential primary
forum."</p>

<p>Dear Ms. Kerger and Mr. Kendall:</p>

<p>In keeping with the Public Broadcasting
Service's long and distinguished history of journalistic integrity, we at
<i>Media Matters for America</i> are
writing to ask that you reconsider your network's decision to have
Republican pollster Frank Luntz take part in coverage of PBS' June 28
Democratic presidential forum.</p>

<p>According to an April 4 PBS press release, Luntz will
participate in coverage of the June 28 candidate forum, which will be televised
live and moderated by PBS host Tavis Smiley. In fact, the release states that
"[i]mmediate public feedback on the performance of the candidates will be
conducted by noted pollster Frank Luntz, who will also appear on 'Tavis
Smiley' on PBS the following evening to discuss his findings."</p>

<p>While we recognize the importance of analyzing the
performance of the Democratic field, it is unconscionable that someone with
Luntz's partisan history, open disdain for Democratic priorities and
candidates, and record of reported reprimand and censure by his peers would be
chosen by PBS for such an important role in a Democratic presidential primary forum.</p>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
In 1997, the American Association
for Public Opinion Research formally <a href="/rd?http://dir.salon.com/story/politics/feature/2000/05/26/luntz/index.xml" title="http://dir.salon.com/story/politics/feature/2000/05/26/luntz/index.xml">reprimanded</a>
Luntz for refusing to release documentation in support of comments he made to
the media regarding his polling work on the Republican Party's 1994
"Contract with America"
campaign platform, according to a Salon.com article. </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
<i>Washington
Post</i> polling director Richard Morin reported that the National
Council on Public Polls censured Luntz "for allegedly mischaracterizing
on MSNBC the results of focus groups he conducted during the [2000] Republican
Convention." </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
In September 2004, MSNBC dropped
Luntz from its planned coverage of that year's presidential debate,
following a letter from <i>Media Matters</i>
that outlined Luntz's GOP ties and questionable polling methodology. </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
According to a January 29, 2007,
article on <i>The New Republic</i>'s
website, Luntz "not only helped write Republican House member Newt
Gingrich's Contract with America;
he was also responsible for its presentation to the public." He also
"advised Republicans trying to impeach Bill Clinton." </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
Luntz's 2002 memo "The
Environment: A Cleaner, Safer, Healthier America" coached Republicans on
new ways to talk about global warming and warned the party that the environment
"is probably the single issue on which Republicans in general -- and
President Bush in particular -- are most vulnerable." </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
A June 2004 memo by Luntz,
"Communicating The Principles Of Prevention &amp; Protection In The War
On Terror," urged Republicans to use concepts such as "[i]t is
better to fight the War on Terror on the streets of Baghdad than on the streets
of New York or Washington" and "9/11 changed everything,"
which have been staples of Republican rhetoric ever since. </li></ul>

<p>Additionally, <i>Media
Matters</i> has documented several recent television appearances in
which Luntz has spread conservative misinformation, smears of Democrats, and
praise of Republicans.</p>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
Luntz has asserted that
former Sen. John Edwards (D-NC) will not be elected president. In a February 24
article, the United Kingdom's
<i>Saturday Magazine</i>
quoted Luntz as saying: "America won't elect John
Edwards president for the same reason we've never elected a used car
salesman. America
hates trial lawyers." And on the February 9 edition of CNBC's <i>Kudlow &amp; Company</i>, Luntz commented on
Edwards' decision at the time not to fire two controversial bloggers from
his campaign, saying, "We all know the phrase
'You are judged by the company you keep.' If
this is the company that John Edwards wants to keep, he may win the Democratic
primary process, but most assuredly he's not
going to be the next president." </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
On the March 2 edition of Fox
News' <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>,
Luntz said of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's (D-NY) treatment of community
activist Saul Alinsky in her senior thesis at Wellesley College:
"In the language she uses she holds him up almost like an icon. ... I
don't know how to say this, but that's like holding up some of the
people from Germany
in the 1930s and '40s." </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
On the March 13 edition of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>, Luntz said:
"We've been analyzing her [Clinton]
over the past few weeks on your show. And she doesn't seem to pick up the
fact that there's too much negativity. There's too much
divisiveness." In the same program, while discussing the abortion rights
views of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R), Luntz said: "This
is someone who defines the phrase 'Says what he means, means what he
says.' " But as <i>Media Matters</i>

has repeatedly noted, Giuliani has taken a number of inconsistent positions on
different aspects of the abortion rights issue. </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
On the June 14 edition of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>, discussing the June
5 Republican presidential debate, Luntz did not correct co-host Sean
Hannity's claim that he was "frustrated" by purported
differences between the Democratic and Republican debates: "The Democrats
don't get the questions on partial-birth abortion or asked if
they've read the National Intelligence Estimate [NIE]. It seems like the
Republicans are getting more scrutiny." In fact, during an April 26
debate, Edwards and Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) faced a question on the abortion
procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion, and at a June 3 debate,
Edwards and Clinton were asked whether they regretted not reading the September
2002 NIE on the threat posed by Iraq.
Clinton's
response to the NIE question was specifically noted by Luntz on the June 4
edition of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>
-- but Luntz did not point out Hannity's mistake during his June 14
appearance. </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
On the October 31, 2006, edition
of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>, Luntz
said, "I always use the line for [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi [D-CA],
'You get one shot at a facelift. If it doesn't work the first time,
let it go.' " </li></ul>



<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
During a conversation about Pelosi
having access to military aircraft to fly between Washington, D.C.,
and her home district, Luntz stated on the February 7 edition of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i> that "it is not
a security issue. [Pelosi] doesn't need a plane." In fact, Wilson
Livingood, the House sergeant at arms, released a statement saying that he had
"advised Speaker Pelosi that the US Air Force had made an airplane
available to [former] Speaker [J. Dennis] Hastert [R-IL] for security and
communications purposes following September 11, 2001." </li></ul>

<p>Again, we hope you will reconsider your decision to
include Luntz in your debate coverage. With his well-documented Republican ties
and history of being criticized and reprimanded by his peers, it's clear
that he cannot be trusted to provide objective analysis of Thursday's
Democratic forum. If he must be a part of PBS' lineup, we would expect
that your viewers will be informed of these facts on-air.</p>

<p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>David Brock,<br>President and CEO<br><i>Media
Matters for America</i></p>
