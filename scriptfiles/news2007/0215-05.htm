<p>WASHINGTON - February 15 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold has introduced legislation 
          to help displaced workers retrain for jobs in the health care sector. 
          This effort, co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), is part of 
          Feingold&#8217;s &#8220;Jobs Week&#8221; addressing economic issues 
          facing working Wisconsinites. The Community-Based Health Care Retraining 
          Act would amend the Workforce Investment Act to help communities create 
          programs that would retrain displaced workers and prepare them for high-demand 
          health care jobs if a community has both significant manufacturing or 
          service sector job losses and shortages in the health care professions. 
          This measure would offer people who lost their jobs in the manufacturing 
          and service sectors an opportunity to train in a field with relative 
          job security. According to the Wisconsin Hospital Association, 15 of 
          the 30 fastest growing occupations in the state are in health care.
<p>&#8220;We should help job seekers get the training they need to be 
          successful,&quot; Feingold said. &quot;This bill would help those communities 
          that have been hit hard by job losses, and also do not have enough health 
          professionals to keep their communities healthy.&quot;</p>
        <p>According to statistics from the Department of Labor, Wisconsin has 
          lost over 90,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2000 and November 
          2006, yet the administration has continued to support policies that 
          lead to the outsourcing of American jobs, especially in the manufacturing 
          sector. Feingold&#8217;s bill works to provide an innovative solution 
          to retrain laid-off workers and other job seekers.</p>
        <p>&quot;This is a small step toward ensuring that our workers have the 
          necessary training in high-demand fields to compete in the new economy.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Feingold&#8217;s legislation is supported by the Wisconsin Association 
          of Job Training Executives, the Wisconsin Hospital Association, Madison 
          Area Technical College, the Workforce Development Board of South Central 
          Wisconsin, the Bay Area Workforce Development Board, the Healthcare 
          Workforce Network, Northwest Wisconsin Concentrated Employment Program, 
          Inc., Southwest Wisconsin Workforce Development, Sauk County Development 
          Corporation, the American Osteopathic Society, Umos, Inc., Fox Valley 
          Workforce Development Board, and the West Central Wisconsin Workforce 
          Development Board.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>Fact Sheet on the Community-Based Health 
          Care Retraining Bill</u></strong></p>
        <p>Senator Russ Feingold has introduced the Community-Based Health Care 
          Retraining Act to help displaced workers retrain for jobs in the health 
          care sector. The Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act would amend 
          the Workforce Investment Act to help communities create programs that 
          would retrain displaced workers and prepare them for high-demand health 
          care jobs if a community has both significant manufacturing or service 
          sector job losses and shortages in the health care professions.</p>
        <p>The Feingold legislation would:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Authorize a demonstration project to help qualifying communities 
            to retrain interested workers who have been displaced from the manufacturing 
            or service sectors for jobs in the health care professions.<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Provide a total of $25 million for demonstration grants for qualifying 
            community partnerships, led by local workforce development boards, 
            to provide this crucial training.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Communities would have flexibility in how they use the demonstration 
          grants, based on their specific needs. Possible uses include creating 
          or increasing capacity at educational and training centers by, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expanding facilities<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Expanding course offerings<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Hiring faculty<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Providing assistance with student loan repayment for faculty<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Assisting with establishing/expanding clinical educational components<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Purchasing additional equipment, such as computers and books</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And/or providing student support services, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing tuition assistance<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Establishing/expanding distance education<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Providing transportation assistance for students<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Providing child care for students with families</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This bill authorizes $25 million for the pilot project and is offset 
          by administrative funds from either DOL or HHS. </p>
