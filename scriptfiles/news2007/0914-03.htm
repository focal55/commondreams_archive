<p>WASHINGTON - September 14 -
Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement in anticipation of President Bush’s call for a troop withdrawal:
<P></P>
“Instead of a surge, now we have a stall. The President’s announcement is nothing but a fake withdrawal,” Kucinich said.
<P></P>
“The President wants to keep the troops in Iraq through the end of his term, with no end to this war in sight. This ‘withdrawal’ announcement is just another attempt to deceive the American people.
<P></P>
“President Bush is giving people a sense that the war is winding down when no such thing is happening. The President’s withdrawal plan of 30,000 troops by mid-2008, only takes us to the same level of troops that we were at a year ago—before the January surge. That’s not a withdrawal, it’s a stall.
<P></P>
“At a time when the American people are demanding a new direction in Iraq, Congress must take a stand and act responsibly to end this war. The President’s war strategy is a complete failure and a majority of Americans recognize this.
<P></P>
“The Democrats have an obligation to the American people who voted for a new direction in Iraq. The Democratic-controlled Congress needs to take a stand against this President and say they will not give him any more money.
<P></P>
“The only way to end this war is to stop funding it. It doesn’t take a vote to end this war. The only thing required is honesty, integrity and a willingness to end the war. Congress needs to end the war and bring our troops home.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
