<p>WASHINGTON - May 9 - This year on Mothers Day weekend, May 10-14, CODEPINK: Women for Peace is organizing a gathering in Washington DC and cities around the country in the spirit of the original Mothers Day proclamation. They are calling for an end to the occupation of Iraq and to start bringing our nation's sons and daughters home by the holidays! Annie Nelson (wife of Willie), Peace mom Cindy Sheehan, Col. Ann Wright Cindy Asner (wife of Ed), actress Gaby Hoffman, Kamala Lopez, director of "A Single Woman" and many military moms from around the country will be a part of the CODEPINK events. You've seen the pink women in countless committee hearings- behind those testifying with signs in pink statue of liberty crowns- and they will descend en masse this week kicking off the weekend's actions Thursday morning.


<p></p>WHEN/WHERE: <br>
9:30am House Judiciary Committee, Albert Gonzales testifies, Rayburn 2141<br>
10am Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Condoleeza Rice testifies, Dirksen 192<br>
10am House Appropriations Defense Hearings with director of "Iraq for Sale"   <br>
Robert Greenwald, Rayburn 2359<br>
2:30pm Homeland Security hearing "Defeat Islamic Extremism" - Dirksen 342<br>



<p></p>"The original intent of Mother's Day was not to give your mom chocolates or breakfast in bed, but for mothers to join together to stop war," says Medea Benjamin, cofounder of CODEPINK. CODEPINK has been in the halls of Congress and in the local and national media nearly every day with their creative actions. The surge in the CODEPINK DC presence came in January, leading up to the 4 year anniversary of the war in Iraq, when the organization decided to rent a 5-bedroom house near Capitol Hill to be the base for daily actions in Congress.
