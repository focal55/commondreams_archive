<p>LOS ANGELES - August 28 -  On the eve of the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Director <a href="http://www.robertgreenwald.org/about.php" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Robert Greenwald</a> and Brave New Foundation join together with a coalition of social justice groups from across the country to launch <a href="http://whenthesaints.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">When The Saints Go Marching In</a>. The three minute YouTube video reveals the devastating reality of hurricane survivors still struggling to rebuild their lives and the amazing hope they maintain about the future.

</p><p>
When The Saints Go Marching In launched today and can be seen at <a href="http://whenthesaints.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">WhenTheSaints.org</a>. The video is spreading rapidly across the internet with the help of partner groups like <a href="http://www.plenty.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Plenty</a>, <a href="http://www.colorofchange.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">ColorOfChange.org</a>, and <a href="http://thinknola.com/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Think New Orleans</a>. When The Saints Go Marching In includes footage of NOLA residents working to make the city home again, and ends with a call to action for viewers to urge the Senate to pass Senator Chris Dodd's (D-CT) Gulf Coast Recovery Bill (S. 1668). 
</p><p>
Many residents have not received the support they need to rebuild their lives two years after the hurricane. "The Feds, the State, and the locals, I mean everybody has just turned their backs on us and just left us to fend for ourselves" says NOLA resident Rudy Aguilar in the video.
</p><p>
"Two years is far too long, the people of New Orleans deserve better" said the video?s director Robert Greenwald. "We hope this campaign will help activate people around the country to work for change."
</p><p>
Additional partners on When The Saints Go Marching In include the Center for Social, Inclusion, Fair Housing Action Center, Advancement Project, Kirwan Institute for Study of Race and Ethnicity, Ella Baker Center, The Methodist Federation for Social Action, Moving Forward Gulf Coast, Oxfam America, National Alliance to Restore Opportunity to the Gulf Coast, Mississippi ACLU and the Institute on Race and Poverty.
