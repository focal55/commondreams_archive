<p>WASHINGTON - February 26 - Marking the end of more than 12 years of conservative rule in the nation's capital, the Campaign for America's Future will double its office space and join a network of progressive groups taking over Washington's K Street power corridor this week.</P>
<P>The Campaign for America's Future moves to 1825 K Street today, joining several other progressive organizations that represent "the new K Street." Progressive Majority and the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center moved at the same time as the Campaign for America's future, joining Americans United and US Action, already in the building. The Campaign for America's Future signed a 10-year lease for the space to accommodate the organization's growth since its founding 10-years ago by a network of 100 prominent progressive leaders.</P>
<P>Campaign for America's Future co-directors Robert Borosage and Roger Hickey are well-known in Washington for bringing together progressive leaders for a biweekly coordinating meeting called the Tuesday Group, which rivals the Wednesday Meetings coordinated by conservative strategist Grover Norquist. The Campaign for America's Future also runs the annual Take Back America conference every summer, the largest gathering of progressive thinkers, leaders and activists in the country.</P>
<P>In an economy of growing insecurity and glaring inequality, the Campaign for America's Future develops progressive alternatives to modern day conservatism's failure to deal with problems facing America. The group waged a hard-hitting ad campaign to expose corrupt members of Congress who did not return to Washington, including former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, and helped lead an effort to defeat President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security. At the new location, the Campaign for America's Future will step up its mobilization behind the Apollo Alliance's plan to create millions of new jobs through energy independence and create a national conversation about providing health care coverage for everyone in America.</P>
