<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 - Earth Island Institute has issued a warning to fish processors, brokers, and trade offices that <strong>Far Ocean Sea Products</strong> of Singapore is apparently selling albacore tuna at below market prices that was caught in gill nets. Tuna companies approved as Dolphin Safe by Earth Island should refuse tuna fished with gillnets.
<p><strong>Far Ocean Sea Products </strong>is not an approved Dolphin Safe company by Earth Island, and any company purchasing from them will lose their dolphin safe status with Earth Island Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong> Gill nets are one of the most destructive fishing techniques used in the world today. Using new mono-filament plastic lines, which are invisible underwater to sea life, gill nets entangle and drown a wide range of sea life, including sharks, dolphins, sea turtles, marine birds, and even whales.</p>
<p>Drift gill nets longer than 1.5 miles are currently banned in worldwide waters by the United Nations. But some fishermen continue to use them illegally, and smaller gill nets below the limit are still lethal to many species and should not be used.</p>
<p>Albacore caught by gill nets has characteristic scarring patterns, especially around the gills. However, consumers, of course, buying canned tuna cannot tell the difference.</p>
<p>We understand that because most companies in the world shun gillnet tuna, <strong>Far Ocean Sea Products </strong> is selling albacore at below-market rates throughout the world, undercutting the efforts of companies committed to protecting marine life and dolphins.</p>
<p>Earth Island Institute approached <strong>Far Ocean Sea Products </strong>to become a Dolphin Safe tuna company, but they have refused.</p>
<p>Companies are urged to reject purchase of tuna from <strong>Far Ocean Sea Products </strong> and to report to Mark Berman of Earth Island Institute any offers of tuna from <strong>Far Ocean Sea Products</strong>.
