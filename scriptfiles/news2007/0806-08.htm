<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 6 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) and U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) have introduced two censure resolutions in their respective chambers condemning the president, vice president and the attorney general for misconduct regarding our military involvement in Iraq and for their repeated assaults on the rule of law at home. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) is a cosponsor of both Senate censure resolutions and Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) is a cosponsor of the Senate censure resolution regarding Iraq. The House resolutions have 19 original cosponsors.

<P></P>“Congress cannot stay silent when the American people are demanding that this administration be held accountable for its blatant misconduct regarding Iraq and its attack on the rule of law,” Feingold said. “These censure resolutions will let future generations know that Congress stood up to the destructive policies of this administration that have weakened our national security, cost more than 3,600 American lives, and undermined the principles on which our country was founded. I applaud Congressman Hinchey for leading this charge for accountability in the House of Representatives.”

<P></P>“From misleading this country into invading Iraq to establishing a warrantless domestic spy program, this White House has continuously misled and deceived the American people while disregarding the rule of law that guides our democracy,” Hinchey said. “The Bush administration has placed an extraordinary burden on this and future generations to recover from the damage done to our Constitution and national security. While it will take time to get our country back on the right track, we in Congress can act now by passing these censure resolutions to hold the White House accountable and to let the historical record show that an equal branch of government found the actions of this administration undeniably reprehensible. I am honored to be working with Senator Feingold on these censure resolutions and look forward to gathering support in order to pass them in both chambers.”

<P></P>The censure resolutions regarding Iraq, S.Res.302 and H.Res.625, condemn the president and vice president for:

<P></P>· Misleading the nation about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s regime and about Saddam’s links to al Qaeda and 9/11

<P></P>· Inadequate planning for military action in Iraq

<P></P>· Overstraining the military and undermining homeland security

<P></P>· Misleading the nation about the strength of the insurgency

<P></P>The censure resolutions regarding the rule of law, S.Res.303 and H.Res.626, condemn the president and attorney general for:

<P></P>· Authorizing the illegal NSA warrantless wiretapping program

<P></P>· Pursuing extreme policies concerning torture and the treatment of detainees

<P></P>· Detaining enemy combatants indefinitely without charges, access to a lawyer, or habeas rights

<P></P>· Unilaterally authorizing flawed military commissions that were subsequently struck down by the Supreme Court

<P></P>· Misleading Congress and the public about, and obstructing investigations into, the firings of U.S. Attorneys

<P></P>· Making misleading statements regarding civil liberties abuses under the Patriot Act

<P></P>· Undermining acts of Congress with signing statements based on extreme theories of executive power

<P></P>Cosponsors of the House resolutions are Representatives Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Capuano (D-MA), Steve Cohen (D-TN), Danny Davis (D-IL), Sam Farr (D-CA), Bob Filner (D-CA), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), John Hall (D-NY), Michael Honda (D-CA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), James Moran (D-VA), Ed Pastor (D-AZ), Steve Rothman (D-NJ), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Carol Shea Porter (D-NH), and Diane Watson (D-CA).
