<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 - The murder of a Tacoma, Washington high school teen this morning drew the nation&rsquo;s attention as the first high profile school shooting of 2007, but in a nation where too many states like Washington have laws that make it too easy for anyone to get guns, it is virtually certain it won&rsquo;t be the last. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Our sympathies go out to the families of the young people involved in this morning&rsquo;s terrible incident at Henry Foss High School,&rdquo; said Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.&nbsp; &ldquo;The police and the public need to get answers to the questions of &lsquo;where did the gun come from, and why are guns so easy to get?&rsquo; Unfortunately, it is not difficult for many of our children to get a gun, and it has been getting easier, not harder.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Legislators in Washington aim to pass a bill to require criminal background checks at so-called gun shows, for example.&nbsp; At such shows, unlicensed gun sellers can sell as many firearms as they wish without having the buyer pass a background check.&nbsp; Washington does not have a child access prevention statute to require parents to keep guns locked away from young people, and has lax requirements for obtaining concealed weapons permits.<br />
<br />
There have been a number of high-profile school shootings in the past five months, including three horrific ones over the course of a week from late September to early October in Colorado, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.<!-- #EndEditable -->
