<p>LOS ANGELES -  November 19 - More than 400 Service Employees International Union members from ten Locals throughout the greater LA area will join thousands of film and TV writers, actors, musicians, and Teamsters in a “labor solidarity” rally and march down Hollywood Boulevard tomorrow. Janitors, nurses, security guards, home care workers and other members of SEIU will take to the streets to call for workers to get their fair share of the profits as the Writers Guild of America (WGA) enters week three of its strike against the media conglomerates of the AMPTP.
<P></P>
“SEIU members stand with the writers,” said SEIU President Andy Stern, as he joined writers picketing outside New York City’s Time Warner Center on November 8. “We understand all too well what it is to be left behind in a global economy. Seeing this attempt to deny the writers their fair share illustrates the raw deal so many workers face today when profit and power is concentrated in the hands of a few, be it media corporations or private equity billionaires.”  (Read the entire statement <a href="http://www.seiu.org/media/pressreleases.cfm?pr_id=1548" target="_new">here</a>.)
