<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 20 - Green Party 2006 Assembly candidate
Peter Thottam, now executive director of the Los Angeles National
Impeachment Center, praised the decision Monday by the West Hollywood City
Council to support the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Dick
Cheney.

<P></P>In adopting the resolution proposed by the impeachment center that Thottam
now directs, West Hollywood became the first Southern California city and
80th municipality nationwide to support impeachment, according to Thottam,
who with other South State Greens helped open the Impeachment Center earlier
this month.

<P></P>The Green Party of the U.S. called for the impeachment of Bush and Cheney in
2003, and the state party officially followed in 2006.

<P></P>The GPCA cited the deception used by the Bush Administration to start the
Iraq war, the use of illegal chemical and biological weapons by the U.S.,
the targeting of civilians with military weapons, the torture of prisoners
and violation of international treaties prohibiting those actions.

<P></P>"Among a minimum of twelve high crimes and misdemeanors, Bush and Cheney
have abused their powers of office by using information they knew to be
false as a justification for the U.S. invasion of Iraq; condoning and
authorizing the torture of prisoners of war and rendering detainees to
foreign countries known to torture; and authorizing warrantless wiretaps on
U.S. citizens for over five years," said Thottam.

<P></P>Thottam, a Los Angeles attorney, helped co-found the Los Angeles National
Impeachment Center, which was sponsored in large part by Westside Greens and
Los Angeles Greens, and progressive Democrats. The goal of the center is to
influence cities and counties to approve impeachment resolutions, and
pressure state and federal representatives to do the same.
