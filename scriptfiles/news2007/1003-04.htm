<p>  WASHINGTON - October 3 – President Bush today vetoed the reauthorization of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), a successful and bipartisan program that has provided health coverage to low-wage families for ten years. The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA:
<P></P>
“The President’s veto is a slap in the face to America’s children. For millions of children in working families, it says ‘No health care for you.’
<P></P>
“This veto contradicts the President’s explicit pledge during the 2004 Presidential campaign when he promised to ‘lead an aggressive effort’ to enroll uninsured children into public health coverage so they will ‘have a healthy start in life.’
<P></P>
“The President’s action also puts him totally out of step with the bipartisan efforts of members of Congress who worked across the aisle to help America’s uninsured children.
<P></P>
“The bill provides hope to 10 million children in low-wage working families who do not receive health coverage in the workplace and who can’t afford health coverage on their own – hope that may be extinguished by the President’s ill-considered veto.
<P></P>
“We will wage a vigorous campaign to ensure that the overwhelming will of the American people ultimately prevails through the enactment of this bill.”

<P></P>
