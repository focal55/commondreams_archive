<p>WASHINGTON - December 7 - This morning Senate supporters of a landmark clean energy bill failed to get enough votes to end debate and bring it to a vote. The Bush administration and its Senate allies blocked the bill because it included a renewable electricity standard and tax provisions. The 53 to 42 vote to end debate by invoking cloture fell short of the necessary 60 votes. Five Republicans -- Sens. Norman Coleman (Minn.), Susan Collins (Maine), Gordon Smith (Ore.) Olympia Snowe (Maine) and John Thune (S.D.) -- joined Democrats to vote for ending debate and proceeding to a vote.

 <P></P>

Below is a statement by Marchant Wentworth, Washington representative for the Union of Concerned Scientists' Clean Energy Program:

 <P></P>

"Instead of following the lead of the House, which yesterday took a bold step toward pulling our energy technology into the 21st century, Senate Republican leaders today hung onto to the technology of the past. By blocking a renewable electricity standard, they voted to allow utilities to continue to generate electricity the same way they did in the 1880s.

 <P></P>

"Given what happened this morning, we are still waiting for a comprehensive, clean energy policy that saves Americans money, creates jobs, bolsters rural economies, and curbs global warming. As the process moves forward, we urge the Senate to move quickly to pass the House-approved fuel economy, renewable fuels and energy-efficiency provisions, and bring a national renewable electricity standard back to the floor for consideration as soon as possible."
