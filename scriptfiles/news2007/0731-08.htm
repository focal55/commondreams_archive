<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 31 -News reports today indicate that
the Bancroft family will accept Rupert Murdoch's $5 billion bid
for Dow Jones and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Media scholar
and Free Press President Robert W. McChesney made the following
statement:


</p><p>"This takeover is bad news for anyone who cares
about quality journalism and a healthy democracy. Giving any
single company -- let alone one controlled by Rupert Murdoch --
this much media power is unconscionable.

</p><p>"Media consolidation has replaced investigative
journalism with infotainment, foreign affairs reporting with
fluff, and local coverage with cookie-cutter content. Contrary
to industry spin, emerging Internet outlets fail to offset
consolidation's affect on journalism. Now Murdoch will control a
broadcast network, a cable news channel and a national newspaper
-- three of the small handful of outlets that set our national
news agenda.

</p><p>"Rupert Murdoch -- who has never hesitated to
use his pulpit to advance his own ideological and business
interests -- won't change his ways. But we can change the
policies that allow companies like News Corp. to dominate our
media.

</p><p>"We can only hope the culmination of this deal
is the wake-up call Washington needs to start rolling back media
consolidation. The first step is to pass new "cross-ownership"
laws that would prevent the owner of a national television
network from owning a national daily newspaper.

</p><p>"Murdoch's empire wouldn't exist if he hadn't
been aided and abetted by Washington policymakers in Congress
and at the FCC. Only by restoring public input in the
policy-making process can we create the kind of diverse,
accessible and independent media that journalism -- and our
democracy -- so desperately needs."
