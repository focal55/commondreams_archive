<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 -Missile defense likely will split Democrats when the House considers the 2008 defense authorization bill (HR 1585) later today or tomorrow, according to an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

<P></P>The bill as drafted by the House Armed Services Committee makes a relatively modest cut of $764 million to the approximately $10 billion missile defense program, and does not eliminate funding for any major program system. 

<P></P>During today*s consideration of the bill, Reps. John Tierney
(D-Mass.) and Rush Holt (D-N.J.) will offer an amendment to cut overall missile defense funding by more than $1 billion and eliminate funding for several anti-missile systems. These include the Airborne Laser, the Kinetic Energy Interceptor and the Miniature Kill Vehicle programs. 

<P></P>*The missile defense budget has deserved tougher scrutiny for years and the Armed Services Committee gave the programs a serious scrub this
time,* said Stephen Young, senior analyst at UCS*s Global Security program. *The Tierney-Holt amendment takes the next logical step, eliminating funding for several flawed programs.* 

<P></P>A majority of House Democrats are expected to support the Tierney-Holt amendment. However, by obtaining the support of most Republicans, the Democratic leadership of the House Armed Services Committee likely will defeat it, said Young. 

<P></P>Meanwhile, the Republicans will offer an amendment to restore the committee*s $764 million funding cut, Young said, but he expects House Democrats to hold together to defeat this attempt.

<P></P>*The one thing that will be missing from the wider debate on the defense bill that will take place over the next two days is a significant discussion of U.S. nuclear policy,* Young added. *The committee took some steps to start that process, but a real floor debate on nuclear policy, including the unnecessary program to replace nuclear warheads, is sorely needed.*
