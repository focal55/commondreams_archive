<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 15 -  Today, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Bush administration's light truck fuel economy standards for model years 2008 to 2011. The case, Center for Biological Diversity v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), was filed in May 2006 by a coalition of states and environmental groups.
<p></p>
The court determined that the proposed rules violated the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (the original fuel economy law) by failing to account for the benefits of reducing global warming emissions; creating new loopholes that undermined potential oil savings; preserving the SUV loophole, which treats sport utility vehicles as if they were light trucks and subject to weaker standards; and exempting the heaviest and least efficient vehicles, such as the Hummer, from meeting any fuel economy standards. In its decision, the court cited an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).
  <p></p>
Below is a statement by David Friedman, research director for UCS's Clean Vehicles Program.
  <p></p>
"Once again, the courts have ruled that the government cannot ignore its responsibility to raise fuel economy standards or consider the costs of global warming. As the Bush administration continues to craft new fuel economy and alternative fuels standards, it should ensure that any new rulemaking doesn't ignore or underestimate the value of reducing global warming pollution.
  <p></p>
"At the same time, Congress is considering legislation to increase fuel economy standards. It should strengthen the 35-mile-per-gallon average fuel economy standard passed by the Senate this summer.
  <p></p>
"Finally, this ruling shows that NHTSA has a history of failing to fix loopholes in fuel economy regulations. The ruling should encourage Congress to eliminate loopholes that would erode the 35-mpg standard; eliminate the false distinction between cars and trucks, which led to the SUV loophole cited in the decision; ensure that all light trucks have a fuel economy standard; and require NHTSA to include the real cost of global warming pollution and America's oil addiction when setting new standards.
  <p></p>
"Those steps would ensure that NHTSA does not repeat the mistakes that led to this decision."
