<p>PORTLAND, MAINE - JUNE 29 - More than 200 people attended an official
Federal Communications Commission hearing on localism Thursday, packing into
the Portland High School auditorium to express their frustration with the
dwindling number of locally owned radio and television stations.<br>
<br>
"I can remember when our newspapers, radio and TV stations were locally
owned," said <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Elery Keene</span></b> of Winslow, Maine,
one of dozens who signed up to testify. "I could talk to the owners
personally, and they had a vested interest in the welfare of our community. The
owners of our mega media systems do not. To them, Central
 Maine where I live is just a small profit center, something that
may show up on the financial statement. I appeal to the FCC to fix this broken
system."<script><!--

In exchange for their free use of the public airwaves, radio and TV
broadcasters are required by the FCC to air programming that is relevant and
responsive to the local community's needs. The FCC hearing in Portland was an opportunity for local residents to tell
the FCC whether Maine's
broadcasters have upheld their local obligations.<br>
<br>

"Tonight we continue a truly remarkable grassroots dialogue about the
future of our media," said <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Commissioner
Michael Copps</span></b>. "And I hope there will be some discussion about
the future of low-power radio and television, because in an age of
consolidation, they are often the last bastions for media diversity and media
democracy."<br>
<br>
All three of the major TV network affiliates in Portland were locally owned until a decade
ago, when out-of-state companies Hearst-Argyle, Sinclair and Gannett snapped up
the stations -- eliminating the lone female media owner in the market. There is
now just one remaining local radio station owner on Portland's commercial radio dial.<br>
<br>
"Frankly, the FCC has failed to protect the interests of the American
people," said <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Commissioner Jonathan
Adelstein</span></b>. "The real broadcast license renewal process
conducted by the FCC has been dwindled down to a postcard, rubber-stamp
process. The end result is that today many stations are unattended and operated
from remote locations; residents are discouraged from monitoring a
station's performance; and dialogue between the station and its community
is too often non-existent."<br>
<br>
The commissioners listened to hours of citizen concerns about the quality of
local news and programming, lack of diversity over the airwaves, and numerous
presentations from local broadcasters.<br>
<br>
"After the Telecom Act of 1996, half of the radio stations in the Midcoast
area became Clear Channel properties -- operated by strangers a long way from
Main Street," said panelist <script><!--

The first FCC localism hearing since 2004, the Portland event was part of a larger set of
initiatives "to enhance localism among radio and television
broadcasters" put forth by former Chairman Michael Powell in 2003.
Previous localism hearings were held in Charlotte,
N.C.; San Antonio,
Texas; Rapid City,
