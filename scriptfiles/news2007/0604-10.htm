<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 4 - Joined by Federal Communications Commissioners and national leaders, tomorrow Free Press will release Off the Dial, a landmark report exposing the devastating impact of media consolidation on radio ownership diversity.

<P></P>WHAT: Release of Off the Dial: How Media Consolidation Diminishes Diversity on the Radio
<P></P>WHEN: Tuesday, June 5, 11:30 a.m. ET
<P></P>WHO:
Gloria Steinem, founder, GreenStone Media<br>
FCC Commissioner Michael Copps<br>
FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein<br>
Mark Lloyd, chair of Media and Communications Task Force, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights<br>
S. Derek Turner, research director, Free Press<br>

<P></P>*** To join the call, dial 888-792-8352 - Conference ID 8875050 or FREE PRESS***

<P></P>The first comprehensive analysis of radio station ownership, Off the Dial finds that while women and people of color make up two-thirds of the population, they control just one-eighth of the country’s full-power radio stations. The study argues that pro-consolidation policies have prevented women and people of color to owning more radio stations.

<P></P>"Consolidation continues to push out female and minority owners and raise insurmountable barriers that shut out prospective buyers,” said S. Derek Turner, research director of Free Press and author of the study. "Any FCC policies aimed at promoting media diversity are doomed to fail if the destructive impact of consolidation is ignored."

<P></P>Off the Dial follows Out of the Picture, an analysis of broadcast television stations released last year, which found similarly low levels of female and minority ownership.

<P></P>"Diversity in communications is the civil rights issue of the 21st century -- one that our nation has yet to take seriously," said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR). “Minorities and women are not just consumers -- they have the right and the obligation to be stewards in our nation’s communications. It is long past time for the FCC to act and reverse this problem."

<P></P>The full study will be available tomorrow morning at <a href="http://www.freepress.net" target="_new">http://www.freepress.net</a> and <a href="http://www.stopbigmedia.com" target="_new">http://www.stopbigmedia.com</a>.
