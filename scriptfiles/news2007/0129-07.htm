<p>WASHINGTON - January 29 - The following is a
statement by Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids
on the lack of support for the international tobacco control treaty from
the Bush Administration:
<p>   In a January 25, 2007, story in The Wall Street Journal, a Bush
Administration spokesman is quoted as saying that the Administration agrees
with most core principles of the international tobacco control treaty, the
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and that "we want to engage with
the rest of the world to help bring them up to our standards." The facts
tell a different story. The United States has not been a strong supporter
of the treaty and, far from continuing to set an example for the world in
fighting tobacco use as it has historically done, the U.S. currently is
falling behind many countries because of its failure to ratify the treaty
and implement its provisions.
<p>  This Administration repeatedly sought to weaken the treaty's provisions
throughout the negotiating process (fortunately, it was usually
unsuccessful). While the U.S. signed the treaty in May 2004, the
Administration has dragged its heels for nearly three years without sending
the treaty to the Senate for ratification. The Administration has said the
35-page treaty is ongoing legal review, but the fact that the review has
taken so long is an indication that at best ratification is a low priority.
The Administration also claims that the treaty raises First Amendment
constitutional concerns. In fact, the treaty's requirement that nations ban
all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship includes an explicit
exemption for nations with constitutional constraints, requiring these
countries to implement restrictions to the extent constitutionally allowed.
<p> In short, the Administration has not stated a credible reason for its
failure to submit the treaty for ratification. We call on President Bush to
immediately submit the tobacco treaty to the Senate for ratification, and
we call on the Senate to quickly ratify it.
<p>  While the U.S. lags, 143 countries have now ratified the treaty,
including China, the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco, and
other major tobacco producing nations such as India and Japan. The U.S. now
lags behind many countries in implementing key tobacco control measures
called for by the treaty, such as large, graphic health warnings, bans on
misleading terms such as "light" and "low-tar", and bans or restrictions on
tobacco marketing.
<p> The U.S. has a special obligation to ratify the treaty and provide
global leadership in the fight against tobacco use because we are home to
Philip Morris, the world's largest multinational tobacco company. It also
sends the wrong message when the world's wealthiest and most powerful
nation fails to lead in addressing a global epidemic that kills five
million people worldwide each year, including more than 400,000 in the U.S.
Unless current trends are reversed, tobacco use will claim one billion
lives worldwide this century. The United States government should be
setting an example and leading the fight against this global catastrophe,
not dragging its heels and making excuses.
<p>  A list of the 143 countries that have now ratified the treaty can be
