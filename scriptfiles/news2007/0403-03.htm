– Today, descendants of Japanese Americans interned during World War II
filed the first of three amicus briefs in support of a Center for
Constitutional Rights (CCR) appeal on behalf of Arab and South Asian
immigrants detained after September 11, 2001. The brief outlines the
damage the internment did to their families and to the laws of equal
protection in the U.S. and draws parallels between what was done to
Japanese Americans during the war and the profiling of Muslim men
today. </p><p>
Jay Hirabayashi said, <i>“I joined the amicus brief because I
believe that the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights should be
inviolable in time of war as much as they are in times of peace. That's
what my father always said and he went to prison holding those beliefs.”</i></p>
<p>

Last June, a federal court found that the government could broadly
detain non-citizens indefinitely on the basis of race, religion, or
national origin. The court also held that the defendants, including
former Attorney General John Ashcroft, could be held liable for the
treatment and terrible conditions the men endured. Defendants appealed
portions of the decision, and CCR and its clients filed a cross-appeal
as well last week.</p>
<p>
Mr. Hirabayashi, Holly Yasui, and Karen Korematsu-Haigh are the
descendants of internees. Their parents Fred Korematsu, Gordon
Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui sued the government in the landmark
Supreme Court case against the internment. The brief, filed today in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by Prof. Eric
L. Muller, a legal historian at the University of North Carolina School
of Law, states that the ruling “painfully resurrects the
long-discredited legal theory” used to justify the internments.</p>
<p> 
<i>“The internment of Japanese Americans was a blot on our history we
should never repeat. We let fear undermine our democracy then, and we
seem not to have learned our lesson,”</i> said CCR Executive Director Vincent Warren.</p>
<p> Two additional amicus briefs will be filed tomorrow. The first is
from former prison wardens and explains the dangers of segregating
prisoners on the basis of race or religion. The final friend of the
court brief is from immigration scholars and leading practitioners in
the field and explains the ways that settled immigration case law was
misapplied by the lower court in its ruling that the government was not
in violation of the law when it held the men for weeks and months
beyond when their immigration issues had been resolved and they were
ready for deportation.</p> <br>
