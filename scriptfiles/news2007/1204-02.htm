<p>NEW YORK - December 4 - Tomorrow, December 5, 2007, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the cases of Boumediene v. Bush and Al Odah v. U.S., brought on behalf of men imprisoned for over five years at Guantánamo Bay and deprived of any meaningful court review.  Today, National Lawyers Guild students and allies in Boston, New York city, Washington, D.C., and other cities around the country, will gather for peaceful demonstrations to direct attention to these important cases.

<p></p>

<b>In New York city students and other concerned citizens will meet from 12:00pm-1:00pm EST in Foley Square in front of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.  Wearing orange jumpsuits and black hoods as a gesture of solidarity with the detainees at Guantánamo, participants will give speeches and chant to draw public attention to this landmark case. </b>
<p></p>

The student organizers from universities such as Columbia, the City University of New York, and New York University coordinated the action in conjunction with the Center for Constitutional Rights and the National Lawyers Guild, as well as the grassroots organization, Witness Against Torture. As the detainees approach the beginning of their sixth year of detention at Guantánamo, student-initiated events such as these seek to increase awareness of the ongoing injustice.  The strength and breadth of this collaborative action demonstrates that the public now sides with the students standing in solidarity with the detainees.  As Rahul Saksena, NLG student and organizer at American University Washington College of Law said, “This case is about human rights and the Rule of Law.  It's about the full restoration of the Constitution of the United States, and it's about Congress's and the President's egregious abuse of power.  We are hitting the streets because people need to know that it is <i>not</i> okay for our government to continue to deny anyone the fundamental, constitutionally-guaranteed right of habeas corpus.  We are here to speak out for those people who have been denied that opportunity.”

Additional participants in this action will hold events in Boston and Washington, D.C., with other locations reserving details.
