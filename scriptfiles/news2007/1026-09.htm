<p>TORONTO - October 26 - On Saturday, October 27, there will be peace rallies in more than 25 cities and towns in Canada calling for Canadian troops to be brought home from Afghanistan. From Vancouver to Halifax, thousands are expected to demand that the Harper Government end Canada’s support for the occupation of Afghanistan.
<P></P>
The events in Canada are part of a global day of action against war that will see demonstrations in Europe, Asia and across the United States.
<P></P>
"The global movement that erupted around the Iraq war is growing again to challenge the occupation of Afghanistan and the so-called War on Terror", said Bob Ages of the Canadian Peace Alliance. "The people of Canada grow ever more upset with this war and are calling for our troops to be brought home alive."
<P></P>
Unfortunately, the Canadian government has followed US foreign policy into Afghanistan, with disastrous results. A clear majority of Canadians now want the troops to come home, and oppose any extension of the mission. Yet Prime Minister Stephen Harper wants to extend it beyond 2009. Already more than 70 Canadians have been killed in Afghanistan, and countless more Afghan civilians. We want to ask Stephen Harper: how many more have to die?
<P></P>
This weekend there will be rallies in: Calgary, Courtney, Edmonton, Fredericton, Grand Forks, Halifax, Hamilton, Kelowna, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Midland, Montreal, Nelson, Ottawa, Quebec City, St John, Thunder Bay, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Windsor, Winnipeg, Wolfville NS and many more. </i><!-- #EndEditable -->
