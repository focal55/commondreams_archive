<p>WASHINGTON - December 3 - Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder released the following statement in response to reports that the congressional leadership is nearing completion of a final energy bill:

 
<P></P>
“Congress appears to be nearing completion of an energy bill that will represent a step forward in the fight against global warming.  However, a number of key issues remain unresolved.

 
<P></P>
“We commend the Democratic leadership for announcing that the bill will require utilities to produce more energy from clean, renewable sources such as wind and solar, and that it will include a substantial increase in automobile fuel economy standards.  After years of Republican energy bills that, if anything, made global warming worse, this is a welcome change of direction.  If they are done correctly, these provisions will be important achievements of which the leadership can be proud.   We are also cautiously optimistic that a $50 billion nuclear loan guarantee program, which would have wasted taxpayers’ money in an ill-conceived effort to resurrect nuclear power, will not be in the bill.

 <P></P>

“It is important to note, however, that a number of details are still being negotiated.  We are especially concerned about the potential inclusion of a massive biofuels mandate that could exacerbate deforestation, water scarcity, and other environmental problems, and we urge the leadership to ensure that strong environmental safeguards are part of any such provision.  We are also disappointed that a tax package that would have eliminated tax breaks for oil companies and promoted clean energy appears to be missing from the bill.  The House passage of such a measure last January was an important marker of progress; it is unconscionable to continue to provide tens of billions of dollars of subsidies to oil companies at a time when we need to reduce fossil fuel use.
<P></P>
 

“In reflecting on this energy bill, it is important to recognize the difference between political reality and real reality.  The truth is that our country’s current energy use is totally unsustainable, and we are quite possibly heading toward systemic collapse.  Dramatic changes are needed, and this bill is just a start.  We commend the Democratic leadership for pushing what appears to be a bold move forward given the current political reality, but it’s also clear that the current political reality is wholly inadequate.  It is incumbent upon all of us to do what we can to change this reality; part of the challenge will be to elect more senators and representatives who will get the job done.”
