<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 28 - <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The resolution, sponsored by Mayor Rocky Anderson of Salt
 Lake City, Utah, was considered at
the USCM 75<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;

Adopted resolutions become the official policy of the USCM, which speaks as one
voice to promote best practices and the most pressing priorities of our
nation’s cities.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In adopting this resolution, the mayors have declared that addiction is
a chronic, treatable medical disorder and a broad public health concern, and
outlined specific policy measures that they endorse.&nbsp;These include a clear
imperative to: </span></font><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
 <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Provide greater
     access to drug abuse treatment on demand, such as methadone and other
     maintenance therapies;</span></font></li>
 <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Eliminate the
     federal ban on funding sterile syringe access programs;</span></font></li>

 <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Establish local
     overdose prevention policies; and</span></font></li>
 <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Direct a greater
     percentage of drug-war funding toward evaluating the efficacy and
     accountability of current programs.</span></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The resolution further recognizes that U.S. policy should not be measured
as it currently is simply by examining drug use levels or number of people
imprisoned, but rather by a “New Bottom Line” based on how much
drug-related harm is reduced.&nbsp;National drug policy should focus on
reducing social problems like drug addiction, overdose deaths, the spread of
HIV/AIDS from injection drug use, racial disparities in the criminal justice
system, and the enormous number of nonviolent offenders behind bars. Federal drug
agencies should be judged—and funded—according to their ability to
meet these goals. Moreover, since the impact of drug policies is most acutely
felt in local communities, evaluation and decision-making must occur at the
local level—and federal funding should go toward enabling communities to
pursue those policies that best meet the unique challenges of substance abuse.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">The resolution is attached below. </span></font></b></p>

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">&nbsp;</span></span></font></u></b></p>

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">A NEW BOTTOM LINE IN REDUCING THE
HARMS OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE</span></font></u></b></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS<i><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span></i></span></font></b><i><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></i>the
United States Conference of Mayors has long been concerned about substance
abuse and its impacts on cities of all sizes; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS<i><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span></i></span></font></b><i><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></i>this
Conference recognizes that addiction is a chronic medical illness that is
treatable, and drug treatment success rates exceed those of many cancer
therapies; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> according
to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 112,085,000
Americans aged 12 or over (46.1% of the US population aged 12 and over) have
used an illicit drug at least once; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> the United
States has 5% of the world’s population, but 25% of the world’s
prisoners, incarcerating more than 2.3 million citizens in its prisons and
jails, at a rate of one in every 136 U.S. residents—the highest rate of
incarceration in the world; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> 55% of all
federal and over 20% of all state prisoners are convicted of drug law
violations, many serving mandatory minimum sentences for simple possession
offenses; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> the U.S.
Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution at it 74th Annual Meeting opposing
mandatory minimum sentencing on both the state and federal levels and urging
the creation of fair and effective sentencing policies; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> drug
treatment is cost-effective: a study by the RAND Corporation found that every
additional dollar invested in substance abuse treatment saves taxpayers $7.46
in societal costs, a reduction that would cost 15 times as much in law
enforcement expenditure to achieve; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> the
National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study shows substantial reductions in
criminal behavior, with a 64% decrease in all arrests after treatment, making
public safety a primary beneficiary of effective drug treatment programs; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> the U.S.
Conference of Mayors adopted a “Comprehensive National Substance Abuse Strategy”
at its 69th Annual Meeting, and a “Comprehensive Drug Prevention and
Treatment Policy” at its 66th Annual Meeting, both of which called for
treatment to be made available to any American who struggles with drug abuse;
and </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> federal,
state, and local costs of the war on drugs exceed $40 billion annually, yet
drugs are still widely available in every community, drug use and demand have
not decreased, and most drug prices have fallen while purity levels have
increased dramatically; and </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> according
to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), only 35% percent of the
federal drug control budget is spent on education, prevention and treatment
combined, with the remaining 65% devoted to law enforcement efforts; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> over
one-third of all HIV/AIDS cases and nearly two-thirds of all new cases of
hepatitis C in the U.S. are linked to injection drug use with contaminated
syringes, now the single largest factor in the spread of HIV/AIDS in the U.S.;
and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> the U.S. Conference
of Mayors has, on three separate occasions, adopted resolutions in support of
expanded access to sterile syringes by people who inject drugs as a public
health strategy to decrease the transmission of blood-borne diseases and
provide links to treatment without increasing drug use; and </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> virtually
all independent analyses have found ONDCP’s drug prevention programs to
be costly and ineffective: the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently
found that both the National Youth Anti-Drug Media campaign and the Drug Abuse
Resistance Education (DARE) program have not only failed to reduce drug use,
but instead might lead to unintended negative consequences; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> blacks,
Latinos and other minorities use drugs at rates comparable to whites, yet face
disproportionate rates of arrest and incarceration for drug law violations:
among persons convicted of drug felonies in state courts, 33% of convicted
white defendants received a prison sentence, while 51% of black defendants
received prison sentences; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> women are
the fastest growing prison population in theU.S., increasing by over 700% since
1977, to 98,600 at the end of 2005. Drug law violations now account for nearly
one-third of incarcerated women, compared to one-fifth of men; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> at year
end 2005, over 7 million U.S.
residents—about 3.2% of the adult population, or 1 in every 32
adults—were incarcerated or on probation or parole, of whom 28% were
under correctional supervision for a drug law violation; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> at its
73rd and 72nd Annual Meetings, the U.S. Conference of Mayors adopted a
resolution to promote the successful reentry of people leaving prison or jail,
through job training, transitional housing, family reunification, drug abuse
and mental health treatment, and the restoration of voting rights; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> the cost
of local law enforcement and of providing services to formerly incarcerated
residents is borne primarily by local governments; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> cities
across the country have experienced a rise in violent crime and must prioritize
scarce law enforcement resources, yet the nation’s police arrested a
record 786,545 individuals on marijuana related charges in 2005—almost
90% for simple possession alone—far exceeding the total number of arrests
for all violent crimes combined; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span></font></b> there is
no easy, “one-size-fits-all” solution to substance abuse and
drug-related harms: individual cities, counties, and states face unique
challenges and therefore</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">require local flexibility to pursue those policies that best meet their
specific needs;</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</span></font></b>
that the United States Conference of Mayors believes the war on drugs has
failed and calls for a New Bottom Line in U.S. drug policy, a public health
approach that concentrates more fully on reducing the negative consequences
associated with drug abuse, while ensuring that our policies do not exacerbate
these problems or create new social problems of their own; establishes
quantifiable, short- and long-term objectives for drug policy; saves taxpayer
money; and holds state and federal agencies accountable; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</span></font></b>
that U.S.
policy should not be measured solely on drug use levels or number of people
imprisoned, but rather on the amount of drug-related harm reduced. At a
minimum, this includes: reducing drug overdose fatalities, the spread of
HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis, the number of nonviolent drug law offenders behind
bars, and the racial disparities created or exacerbated by the criminal justice
system; and</p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</span></font></b>
that short- and long-term goals should be set for reducing the problems
associated with both drugs and the war on drugs; and federal, state, and local
drug agencies should be judged – and funded – according to their
ability to meet specific performance indicators, with targets linked to local
conditions. A greater percentage of drug war funding should be spent evaluating
the efficacy of various strategies for reducing drug related-harm; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</span></font></b>
that a wide range of effective drug abuse treatment options and supporting
services must be made available to all who need them, including: greater access
to methadone and other maintenance therapies; specially-tailored, integrated
services for families, minorities, rural communities and individuals suffering
from co-occurring disorders; and effective, community-based drug treatment and
other alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent drug law offenders, policies
that reduce public spending while improving public safety; and</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</span></font></b>
that the Conference supports preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and
other infectious diseases by eliminating the federal ban on funding of sterile
syringe exchange programs and encourages the adoption of local overdose prevention
strategies to reduce the harms of drug abuse; and </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</span></font></b>
the impact of drug use and drug policies is most acutely felt on the local
communities, and therefore local needs and priorities of drug policy can be
best identified, implemented and assessed at the local level. A successful
national strategy to reduce substance abuse and related harms must invest in
the health of our cities and give cities, counties, and states the flexibility
they need to find the most effective way to deal with drugs, save taxpayer
dollars and keep their communities safe.</p><P></P>
