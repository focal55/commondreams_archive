<p>WASHINGTON - December 10 - Today, on Human Rights
Day, Africa Action stated that respect for human rights is a foundation
for political and social stability and economic progress. The struggle
of Africa's people for human rights continues, and, as in the past,
international support can play an important role. Africa Action noted
today that the U.S. support for human rights in Africa should focus on
promoting the full spectrum of human rights, however, U.S. policy has
tended instead to be quite selective, guided very much by perceived
strategic U.S. interests. While President Bush himself identified the
advancement of human rights as an essential component of national
security and has been openly critical of the human rights violations
perpetrated under the government of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, the Bush
administration has been less quick to criticize other countries, like
Nigeria, Morocco or Ethiopia, which are considered strategically
important to the U.S.
<P></P>
Similarly, the U.S. seeks reconciliation with the Khartoum regime in
Sudan – important to the U.S. in terms of intelligence gathering on
terrorism as well as oil – despite its continuing genocide against
civilians in Darfur. Africa Action calls attention to this dynamic
describing it as reminiscent of relations during the Cold War, when
geopolitical considerations were placed far above human rights concerns.
This failure to prioritize action to end the genocide in Darfur has
resulted in an international political deadlock, where the imperative to
protect civilians has been neglected and the violence continues unabated.
<P></P>
Gerald LeMelle, Executive Director of Africa Action said today, “The
people of Africa have a right to life and dignity, peace and security,
and the U.S. must play a constructive role in the international
community to prioritize defending human rights on the continent. In
particular, the U.S. must act now in the United Nations Security Council
to ensure that the planned deployment of UN peacekeepers to Darfur is
implemented despite obstructionism of the Sudanese government that
threatens to scuttle a multinational intervention to protect civilians.”
<P></P>
Though the genocide in Darfur has been making headlines, there are human
rights that need defense in other conflicts on the continent including
in the Democratic Republic of Congo where almost 4 million have been
killed in the conflict over the past decade. The people in Zimbabwe have
never been more desperate as they struggle for democracy and the crisis
in Somalia has deepened in recent weeks as well. In addition to these
gross human rights violations, Africa Action noted the importance of
addressing economic and social rights.
<P></P>
“U.S. and international support for human rights and the rule of law
must be unequivocal. It should involve the promotion of not only
political and civil rights but also of economic and social rights as
critical expressions of healthy societies. U.S. policies toward Africa
must include support for universal access to health care and education,
the rights of workers to organize and the empowerment of women,” said
Gerald LeMelle today. “One way to support Africa’s right to health would
be the commitment of $50 billion to fight global AIDS. Another way to
shore up economic rights in Africa would be for the U.S. to expand
recent debt cancellation efforts to include all African nations without
harmful economic conditions in order for countries on the continent to
have full access to national resources to fight poverty.”
