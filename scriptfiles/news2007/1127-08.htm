The Presidential Candidates Survey and Quotes project coincides with the release of a new DVD by the Foundation called “Nuclear Weapons and the Human Future.” The  20-minute DVD, written and narrated by Foundation President David Krieger and produced by Director of Programs, Rick Wayman, shows how the world will benefit by the multi-lateral, phased, verifiable and irreversible disarmament of nuclear weapons. The new DVD, which can be viewed on the web <a href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/nuc_weapons_human_future.php" target="_new">http://www.wagingpeace.org/nuc_weapons_human_future.php?print</a> or ordered free, has already been snapped up for distribution in more than 100 countries by the World Federation of United Nations Associations.

“We believe the first step to abolishing nuclear weapons is changing the way people think about them,” said  Steven Crandell, Director of Public Affairs for the Foundation. “This DVD is a wake-up call about nuclear weapons. It also provides an explanation of what can be done to make the world a safer place and how we all can make a difference.

“Getting rid of nuclear weapons is, after all, common sense. We work hard to prepare for all kinds of disasters. Do we take steps to reduce or eliminate the threat from fire, flood, famine and epidemics? Of course, we do. Can we take steps to eliminate the threat nuclear weapons? Of course, we can. Nuclear disarmament is just a form of disaster prevention. We made them. We can un-make them.”
