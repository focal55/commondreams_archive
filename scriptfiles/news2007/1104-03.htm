<p>WASHINGTON - November 4 - Thousands of supporters,
political activists, and other interested citizens are expected to dial in
Monday (tomorrow) evening to a nationwide conference call to hear
Democratic Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich explain why and how he
plans to force an up-or-down vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on
the impeachment resolution against Vice President Richard B. Cheney.
    <P></P>Last week, the Ohio Congressman announced that he will be offering a
"privileged resolution" on Tuesday, November 6, that will, within two days,
require House members to vote on what to do with the impeachment measure,
which currently has 22 sponsors. Dozens of supportive organizations have
advised the Kucinich campaign that they will be lobbying Congressional
representatives heavily over the next few days to support the Ohio
Congressman impeachment resolution (House Resolution 333).
    <P></P>The conference call is expected to begin at about 7:30 p.m. ET on
Monday. It will be open to anyone, including representatives of the news
media. Additional details will be posted on the campaign website,
