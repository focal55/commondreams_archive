<p>WASHINGTON DC -- On the eve of the World Bank’s 
annual Spring Meetings (Apr. 14-15) Friends of the Earth International 
challenged the bank's 184 government shareholders to halt all funding 
for projects contributing to climate change.

<P></P>“Climate change is no longer just an environmental issue, it is a 
development issue and a looming humanitarian catastrophe, ultimately 
threatening our security and survival,“ said David Waskow of Friends of 
the Earth US.

<P></P>“Government representatives should have the courage to take some real 
action and stop World Bank funding for all projects that contribute to 
climate change,”he added. “This means no more funding for oil, coal and 
gas projects.“

<P></P>“We are happy to see that the US Congress seems to be taking the lead’, 
he added, referring to US Congressional legislation expected to be 
passed on April 17.

<P></P>“It is up to the governments that rule the World Bank to get the Bank 
out of the dirty energy business. There is no lack of alternative 
investment options. There is a wealth of sound energy investment 
opportunities out there,“ David Waskow added.

<P></P>The World Bank invests 2 to 3 billion USD a year in greenhouse 
gas-producing energy projects that fuel climate change and fail to help 
the world’s poor people. [1]

<P></P>In 2005, only 9% of the World Bank Group's energy financing went to 
renewable energy and energy effiency. In 2005, the increase for lending 
towards renewables and energy efficiency was only 7% (or 14 million USD) 
instead of the 20% target that the Bank had set for itself. [2]

<P></P>“The West-African Gas Pipeline, which passes through my country, is a 
sad example of archaic energy financing“, said Mike Karipko of 
Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria. “We are happy 
that the World Bank’s own Inspection Panel decided last March to 
thoroughly investigate the project’s ongoing problems,“ he added. [3]

<P></P>On Monday, April 16, Friends of the Earth US will organize a conference 
on climate change and international development from 9.00 am-5.30 pm at 
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K Street NW, 
Washington, DC. For more information see _
