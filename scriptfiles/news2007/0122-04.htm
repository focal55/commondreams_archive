<p>WASHINGTON - January 22 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Wal-Mart's decision to include birth control in its basic health insurance coverage plan for the first time a step forward for women's health and reproductive freedom. </P>
<P>"Wal-Mart's decision to include birth control in its insurance coverage plan is a victory for thousands of American women," Keenan said. "We applaud the women who had the courage to file a lawsuit against Wal-Mart and bring public attention to this disparity. But we cannot forget that almost half the states in this country do not ensure that health insurance companies cover birth control equally with other prescription drugs &ndash; leaving women often struggling or unable to access contraception. As the nation's largest employer, Wal-Mart's announcement should send a strong message that ensuring women's access to birth control is a commonsense policy that Americans support."</P>
<P>Currently, 24 states do not require insurance coverage for contraception. Several years ago family-planning supporters in Congress were able to win "contraceptive equity" for federal employees - but anti-choice lawmakers have systematically blocked a similar benefit for American women nationwide. </P>
<P>NARAL Pro-Choice America has been a leader in calling on Wal-Mart to change its reproductive health policies. Earlier this year, a lawsuit filed against Wal-Mart for refusing to carry emergency contraception set off a nationwide campaign that ended with Wal-Mart bowing to public pressure and agreeing to stock Plan B&reg; in each of its 3,400 stores. However, Wal-Mart still allows pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions if they personally oppose birth control &ndash; leaving the door open for women to lose access to their legally prescribed medication due to a pharmacist's personal beliefs.</P>
