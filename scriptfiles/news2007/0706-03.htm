<p>SPAIN - July 6th 2007  - Anti-poverty campaigners around the world are organising a broad range of events around July 7th to mark the midway point for the UN Millennium Development Goals and to hold their governments to account. Part of the growing Global Call to Action against Poverty (GCAP), the July 7th events will focus on how governments' efforts to meet these goals are insufficient and to highlight the growing threat of climate change on the poor and marginalised (data below).

 

<p>"At the mid-point for the MDGs we are sorely disappointed with the poor performance of states that signed millennium declaration and made promises to their citizens. Millions of impoverished people continue to live in socially dismal and subhuman conditions. Most countries in the South lag far behind and Northern countries have largely failed to fulfil aid promises.

<p>GCAP campaigners understand the need to meet and exceed these agreed goals. We're worried that policies, plans and actions by most Southern countries don't show enough political force," said Irfan Mufti, GCAP Global Campaign Manager in Pakistan this week.

 

<p>In 2000, 189 governments agreed to a set of eight time-bound targets (MDGs) which, if achieved, will help alleviate extreme poverty by 2015.  In Africa , for example, 13 African countries (mostly in North Africa ) can achieve or come close to the MDGs by 2015 if they continue at the current pace. The remaining African countries have not made any progress in gender equality and women's empowerment, and millions of Africans are still living in an ocean of poverty. Elsewhere, in Asia, Latin America and parts of the Middle East there are still huge disparities between countries and progress.

 

<p>In 40 countries and over 65 cities worldwide, GCAP groups have organised a variety of creative events to draw attention to the goals.  Among them: AUSTRALIA –images of a "Face up to Poverty" project will be projected onto the Opera house for the first time in history as part of a nationwide push to increase government aid.

<p>NIGER, HONDURAS, BANGLADESH and elsewhere across the South - reports

assessing progress on the MDGs are being launched and debated and petitions demanding immediate actions presented at government buildings. AZERBAIJAN - a local GCAP rally on Saturday July 7th will focus on the high incidence of child and maternal mortality. And demand government action. SRI LANKA - a national youth art competition on the MDGs is taking place.

 

<p>Everywhere people will wear a white band as a symbol of solidarity with

<strong>CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE POOR</strong>

<p>Climate change has been woven into many GCAP July 7th events. People living in the world's poorest and most unequal countries have noted with growing concern that they are already the most affected by changing weather patterns - flooding, deforestation and desertification – and demanding action. Donor countries can play a key role by paying their fair share of climate adaptation costs to Africa and other developing regions. In JOHANNESBURG on July 7th, GCAP Spokesperson, Kumi Naidoo, will go on stage during the LIVE EARTH concert to address the local and international audience.

 

<p>"It is no secret that climate change increases the gap between rich and poor. The polluters don't see the effect of their actions while the poor, who rely heavily on natural resources, suffer through increasing temperatures, droughts, flooding and rising sea levels. Tackling the causes of climate change is a question of justice for the poor who are already burdened by unfair trading rules, insufficient aid and debt repayments." said GCAP Chair and Spokesman, Kumi Naidoo.  

 

<p>GCAP campaigners will continue their pressure on governments throughout 2007. On October 17th they will act jointly with the UN Millennium Campaign to take part in Stand Up & Speak out activities registering millions via www.standagainstpoverty.org .

<p>The Global Call to Action against Poverty (GCAP) is a global alliance of International NGOs, grass roots organizations, trade unions, community groups, women's organizations, faith groups, youth groups, local associations and other campaigners working together across more than 100 national coalitions. GCAP is calling for action from the world's leaders to meet their promises to end poverty and inequality.

 

<p><strong>Facts on the MDGs and Climate Change and Poverty
</strong>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions have caused global temperatures to rise by .74 degrees Celsius since the beginning of the 20th century and if not reduced urgently global temperatures could exceed 2 degrees.

 

<p>It is estimated that 60% of current human migration is caused by climate change and natural disasters.

 

<p>On current trends sub-Saharan Africa will not meet sanitation set out by the Un Millennium Development goals until 2105 and in Zambia until 2130.

 

<p>$47bn per year is needed to meet Health, Education and Water Sanitation Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  $1 trillion is spent on military each year and $40bm on pet food each year around world- the money is available it is a question of political will where this directed.

 

<p>It would take $4bn per year to meet MDG 7 on halving the number of people who don't have access to drinking water. That is the same as Europe spends on bottled water each month.

 

<p>Melting glaciers increases the risk of flooding. The rise in sea levels could oblige the forced displacement of over 200 million people.

 

<p>Harvests will continue to decrease particularly in Africa . By 2100 Chad , Niger and Zambia risk losing almost their entire agricultural sector.

 

<p>The health impact of climate change on the poor is extreme. Diarrhoea caused by lack of access to clean water is responsible for the deaths of 5 million people (90% children). It is estimated that climate change, at current levels, could lead to a 10% increase in cases in some regions by 2030.

 

<p>At current rates, by 2015 around 2.170 million people around the world will still lack basic health services and 650 million will not have access to drinking water.
