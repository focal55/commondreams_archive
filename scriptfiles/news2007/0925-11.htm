<p>  WASHINGTON - September 25 - Yesterday, Rick Sanchez, host of CNN's 

<i>Out in the Open</i>, reported that 
Bill O'Reilly attacked <i>Media Matters for 
America</i> for documenting racially charged comments he made on his 
nationally syndicated radio program, calling it a "hatchet job." The prominent 
conservative cable news and talk radio host is furious that <i>Media Matters</i> has brought his damaging 
statements to the public's attention yet again.</p>

<p>"<b>O'Reilly's attack is hardly surprising. Without fail, 
his automatic response to scrutiny of his ignorant comments has been to attack 
the messenger,</b>" said Eric Burns, Chief Communications 
Strategist at <i>Media Matters for 
America</i>. "<b>O'Reilly is enraged that 
<i>Media Matters</i> has once again 
shone the spotlight of public attention on his racially charged 
remarks, holding him accountable for his own 
words.</b>"</p>

<p>Pursuant to its mission of comprehensively 
monitoring and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. 
media, <i>Media Matters</i> simply 
posted O'Reilly's comments in context. <i>Media 
Matters</i> supplied the audio of O'Reilly's statements, recorded 
directly from the broadcast, accompanied by the relevant section of the 
transcript of the program.</p>

<p><i>Media 
Matters</i> documented O'Reilly's racially insensitive comments 
from the September 19 edition of Westwood One's <i>The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly</i>. 
Discussing his recent dinner with Rev. Al Sharpton at the Harlem restaurant 
Sylvia's, O'Reilly stated that he "<b>couldn't 
get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia's restaurant and 
any other restaurant in New York 
City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's 
run by blacks, primarily black patronship</b>." O'Reilly added: "<b>There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming, 
'M-Fer, I want more iced tea.'</b> "</p>

<p>In fact, this is not an isolated 
incident. As Media Matters has documented, 
O'Reilly has a history of making racially 
charged remarks on his radio and television 
programs.</p>
