<p>New York, 17 April 2007 -- "There is no question that the proliferation 
of 'Weather of Mass Destruction' is a worthy topic for the Security 
Council. Its appearance on the Council's agenda represents a coming of 
age and recognition that a failure to act now could see UN peace keepers 
patrolling the climate change front line for centuries to come," said 
Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International.

<P></P>"With the end of the cold war and facing the looming threat of 'warm 
wars', the Security Council needs to move away from security based on 
the projection of force to one based on the notion of "Sustainable 
Security", and the recognition that, when it comes to climate change, 
prevention is better than cure."

<P></P>"In the ground-breaking report of The World Commission on Environment 
and Development of 1987, Our Common Future, Gro Halrem Brundtland wrote: 
"A world in which poverty is endemic will always be prone to 
environmental disaster." It is time to turn that on its head: "A world 
in which environmental disaster is endemic will always be prone to 
poverty and war."

<P></P>"Never before has it been so obvious that the issues of green and peace 
are inextricably intertwined and that they must be tackled together. As 
the UN grapples with issues of reform and seeks to update its mission 
for the 21st century it need look no further than the issue of climate 
change and the emerging issues of climate justice and conflict."
