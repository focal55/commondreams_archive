<p>WASHINGTON - November 12 - The Green Party has released its final tally of Green victories on Election Day, November 6, 2007.</p>
          <p>16 Green candidates, out of 94 who ran on November 6, won their races for local office (pending confirmation of David Lussier's county legislature victory in New York).  A total of 142 Greens ran for public office in the 2007 off-year elections.</p>
          <p>"We're very proud of all our 2007 candidates. Along with our winners, we also note that Green candidates who didn't win received impressive percentages in cities and towns where Greens are still a new party, or where local politics have been dominated by a single party, as in Baltimore and Tucson.  These percentages prove that more and more Americans are willing to vote Green, and that the party made a leap forward in 2007," said TE Smith, a member of the DC Statehood Green Party.</p>
