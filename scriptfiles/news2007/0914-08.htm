<p> OAKLAND, CA - September 14 - 
As President Bush prepares to announce that he will
return the number of troops in Iraq to pre-surge levels by July of 2008
in a televised address to the nation, Congresswoman Barbara Lee
(D-Oakland) issued the following statement:<br>
<br>“Tonight
the President will make his case for more of the same stay-the-course
strategy that puts us on a path for at least 10 years of occupation in
Iraq.<br><br>“It is time to call this what it is – an exit strategy for
President Bush at the expense of our troops.&nbsp; It’s the President’s plan
to run out the clock on his failed policy, to move the goalposts once
again, so that he can sneak out the backdoor and leave the American
people holding the bag.<br><br>“Well let me ask you: how many of our
troops should die so the President can save face?&nbsp; How many billions of
our tax dollars should we spend so the President can avoid admitting
his policy has failed?<br><br>“It is clear he won’t take responsibility
to end his failed policy, which means that members of Congress are
going to have a choice to make.<br><br>“Are they going to stand with
the President, and an open-ended occupation that sacrifices our troops’
lives so he can save face?&nbsp; Or are they going to act to bring his
disastrous policy to a responsible – and long overdue–conclusion. &nbsp;<br><br>“The
choice is simple.&nbsp; Congress should not provide another dime for the
President’s failed policy.&nbsp; Instead, we should provide the money
necessary to fully fund the safe, timely and responsible redeployment
of troops and contractors from Iraq.”
