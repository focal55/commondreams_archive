<p>LONDON - November 6 - <br>
<br>
With    George Monbiot, author, journalist, campaigner
<P></P>
            John Sauven, Executive Director of Greenpeace UK
<P></P>
            Claire Fauset, from this year’s Heathrow “Camp for Climate Action” 
<P></P>
and      Phil Thornhill,  National Coordinator of the  ‘Campaign against Climate Change’
<P></P>
 

 

This year the arctic ice cap shrunk to just 60% of its normal size, exceeding the direst predictions of the UN’s panel of climate scientists. As emissions soar, as global climate change accelerates faster than any of the predictions and as “positive feedbacks” and “non-linear progression” threaten to make a nonsense of all the forecasts based on the concept of a gradual warming process…………  do we have a plan even remotely radical enough to head off climate disaster ?

 <P></P>

George Monbiot has offered a radical blueprint for survival in his book ‘Heat’ but has recently said that even that does not go far enough…………..

 <P></P>

Says John Sauven :  “The government’s current energy strategy simply won’t put us on a path to delivering the kinds of cuts needed to combat climate change”

 
<P></P>
Claire Fauset is part of a radical ‘Direct Action’ movement that grabbed the headlines earlier this year with their  protest camp near Heathrow airport.
<P></P>
 

This is a timely meeting exactly one month before the National Climate March on December 8th during the Bali Climate Talks – and coming at a time when we might need to re-asses what we need to do to win the fight against the catastrophic destabilisation of global climate.
