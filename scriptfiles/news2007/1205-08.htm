<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 5 -The American Civil Liberties Union today urged the Senate 
Judiciary Committee to thoroughly scrutinize a new bill offered by ranking 
member Senator Specter (R-PA). Senator Specter’s bill, the FISA Intelligence 
Surveillance Substitution Act of 2007, would remove the telecommunications 
companies and insert the federal government as the defendant in cases currently 
pending over domestic spying. The bill will be marked up by the full Judiciary 
Committee this Thursday.</p>
<p>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</p>

<p>"Letting the administration step in as the defendant in these cases may 
prevent a public airing of the facts. Three daunting hurdles could derail these 
cases if the administration steps in as the defendant – state secrets, executive 
privilege and sovereign immunity. Unless something is done to ensure that these 
defenses cannot be used to shut down these legitimate and crucial lawsuits, 
substitution is just immunity in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>"This substitution proposal does not put up a roadblock to immunity - it just 
lengthens the journey. Since the revelation of this program in 2005, the 
American people have been waiting for an answer to why government and the 
telecoms violated our privacy. We’ve waited too long. We deserve our day in 
court."</p>
