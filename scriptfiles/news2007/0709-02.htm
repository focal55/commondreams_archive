<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 9 -   Today the American Civil Liberties 
Union and other privacy groups met with FBI Director Robert Mueller to discuss 
the FBI's new guidelines for internal controls concerning its use of National 
Security Letters (NSLs). In March, 
the Department of Justice Inspector General (IG) issued a report detailing 
significant abuse of the FBI's NSL powers. 
The FBI originally downplayed the extent of the abuse reported by the IG, 
alleging the number of cases selected for review in the IG audit did not 
constitute a representative sample. 
However, the FBI's own audit revealed more than a thousand additional 
abuses using a sample of just ten percent of its national security 
investigations. The FBI has held a 
series of meetings to inform the civil rights and privacy community about its 
response to these revelations, but internal guidelines are clearly not enough to 
prevent this kind of abuse.</p>
<p>The following may be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, 
Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office: </p>

<p>"Though we appreciate Director Mueller's continued outreach, 
these reforms are 'too little, too late' and we remain skeptical that any 
internal FBI regulation of NSL use will correct the problem. For more than three 
years the FBI's unchecked use of its NSL powers resulted in thousands of 
violations of law and policy. FBI 
leadership was either unaware of these abuses or was informed of problems and 
did nothing to prevent them. Either 
way, it's clear that the bureau requires outside oversight and a legislative 
solution is required. </p>
<p align="left">"Unchecked authority will inevitably lead to abuse. The FBI, frankly, should never have been 
given this broad authority in the first place. When both the IG's report and the 
bureau's own internal investigation turn up rampant abuses, it's painfully clear 
there needs to be an independent check on this power. It is naive to think those 
who break the rules should make the rules. 
Congress should begin imposing oversight and mandating judicial review of 
NSL use." </p>
