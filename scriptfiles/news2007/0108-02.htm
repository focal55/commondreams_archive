<p>WASHINGTON - January 8 - As a member of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I look forward to the confirmation hearing of Admiral Mike McConnell. I will carefully examine Admiral McConnell’s qualifications for this unique and critically important position. We need strong, sustained leadership at the ODNI to ensure that our intelligence is objective and accurate, that our intelligence capabilities are organized to effectively meet the threats confronting our country, and that our citizens are protected consistent with our laws and the Constitution.

<p>Evaluating the nomination of John Negroponte to be Deputy Secretary of State is a responsibility that I also look forward to as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This key position has been left vacant for too long, leaving a detrimental gap in the State Department’s ability to address critical issues in Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan and elsewhere.
