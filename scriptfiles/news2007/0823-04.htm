<p>PORTLAND, Maine - August 23 - In the past year, the market for sustainable, organic and natural foods has exploded, and only one news service has given industry professionals continuously updated online coverage: Sustainable Food News.
<P></P>
Marking its first year anniversary last month, Sustainable Food News (<a href="http://www.sustainablefoodnews.com" target="_new">www.sustainablefoodnews.com</a>) has already cemented its position as the leading online provider of daily business news and market information to these burgeoning industries both in the United States and abroad.
<P></P>
Today, subscribership and corporate syndication deals are giving tens of thousands working in the organic, sustainable and natural food industries - from retailers and restaurants, farmers and ranchers to processors, distributors, environmental groups and government agencies - access to SFN’s daily content, helping them forge new and innovative vendor relationships and sourcing habits.
<P></P>
“I just heard from your U.K. sushi subscriber this morning and was approached by Coleman Natural Foods yesterday (Golden, Colo.). They read the article on Sustainable Food News and are interested in our biodegradable packaging solution,” said Steve Johnston, sales manager for biodegradable packaging supplier M2 Formulex, based in Toronto.


U.S. retail sales of grocery products making some form of ethical claim reached nearly $33 billion in 2006, and should surpass $57 billion by 2011, market research firm Packaged Facts estimates.
<P></P>
Sustainable Food News has inked a syndication deal with U.S. Foodservice, the second largest foodservice distributor in the United States. Thousands of employees now have access to SFN’s daily content on the company’s intranet. Two similar deals are pending, potentially adding 17,000 more to the readership.



<P></P>
Next month, Sustainable Food News is featured on the cover of the fall product catalog of United Natural Foods, Inc., the largest organic and natural foods distributor in the United States.
<P></P>
SFN Publisher Dan McGovern has quickly become the go-to expert on sustainable and organic food issues for both the industry and media - whether it’s a Wall Street Journal reporter citing his January exclusive that retail giant Wal-Mart would begin selling an eco-friendly version of the controversial Chilean sea bass, or Public Radio International’s “The World” segment interviewing him in July to help explain to listeners nationwide the issues surrounding trends such as ‘food miles.’
<P></P>
McGovern’s also been recently quoted in The Los Angeles Times and, just last week, the Montreal Gazette. Also last week, he was tapped to speak at a national sustainability summit for retailers in 2008. The event has yet to be publicly announced.
<P></P>
McGovern recently spoke at the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Sustainable Foods Institute discussing cutting-edge trends in sustainability such as ‘low carbon diets.’
<P></P>
In the next few months, Sustainable Food News is adding to our editorial and sales teams, enhancing our market coverage and means to deliver it. The SFN website is also adding enhanced multimedia including a blog, a Careers section and Classifieds listings.
