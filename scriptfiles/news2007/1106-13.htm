<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 6 - Members of Congress know where the money is going: now citizens can, too. The Sunlight Foundation today released a Google Earth application that plots the locations for almost 1,500 earmarks in the House Defense Appropriations bill. This graphic illustration of defense earmarks gives anyone with an Internet connection a bird’s eye view of exactly where Congress is directing federal spending – and the ability to investigate whether the earmarks address pressing needs, favor political contributors or are simply pure pork. </p>
<p>To start navigating earmarks, download <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth" target="_new">Google Earth</a> and then download <a href="http://www.sunlightlabs.com/earmarks/house_defense_earmarks_08.kml" title="House Defense" target="_new">Sunlight's House Defense file</a>. This presents a 3-D view of where the recipients of earmarks in the House Defense appropriations bill are located and corresponding links to <a href="http://earmarkwatch.org/" title="EarmarkWatch.org" target="_new">EarmarkWatch.org </a>–where citizens can further research each earmark and its recipient. Users can search for earmarks by city, state or zip code.</p>
<p>"Navigating earmarks on Google Earth is much more compelling and user-friendly than reviewing a list of earmarks or a spreadsheet," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation. "Americans who are concerned about government spending and the upsurge in member use of earmarks now have a simple way to visualize and investigate how Congress is awarding defense-related federal funds."</p>
<p>Drawing on data from its EarmarkWatch.org site (created in collaboration with Taxpayers for Common Sense), this application lets citizens easily find and scrutinize House Defense earmarks on a state or district level. Sunlight created this Google Earth application to demonstrate the power of posting information online in graphically appealing ways that makes data more easily understood.</p>
<p><i>The Sunlight Foundation supports, develops and deploys new Internet technologies to make information about Congress and the federal government more accessible to the American people. Through its projects and grant-making, Sunlight serves as a catalyst to create greater political transparency and to foster more openness and accountability in government.<br></i><!-- #EndEditable -->
