<p>WASHINGTON, DC- Catholics for an End to the War in Iraq (CEWI)  today announced an important milestone in its national effort to mobilize Catholics to become a powerful voice for ending the war in Iraq.

<p>In just four weeks time, more than 10,000 Catholics from across the United States have signed Catholics for an End to the War's online petition ( www.catholicsforanend.org) urging leaders to commit to a responsible withdrawal of U.S. troops.  In September, CEWI will present Congress with thousands of signatures showing Catholics stand united in their call for a new Iraq policy.

<p>"Church leaders and individual Catholics have opposed U.S. policy in Iraq since before the war began," said Sister Simone Campbell, SSS, executive director NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby. "NETWORK supports this petition because it lets thousands of Catholics unite to speak out even more strongly for an end to the violence and occupation. It's time for a responsible withdrawal of combat troops and a new course of action to bring peace to Iraq."

<p>Following the lead of Pope John Paul II, who in January 2003 urged U.S. leaders to forgo war in favor of peaceful engagement with Iraq, and recognizing that this year's troop escalations have failed to improve conditions in Iraq, the CEWI petition calls for a new Iraq policy based on dialogue, diplomacy, and reconstruction.   Of the thousands of Catholics who have joined the CEWI effort, hundreds have volunteered to help organize local activities aimed at key legislators.  In CEWI's largest "offline" actions yet, members in seven states will participate in national "Take a Stand" events next week (August 26 to September 1) in coordination with Americans Against Escalation in Iraq's Iraq Summer program.
