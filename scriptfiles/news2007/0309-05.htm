<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. &#8211; March 9 &#8211;&nbsp;Yesterday the House of Representatives voted to approve the creation of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, first proposed in January by Speaker Pelosi.  Today, Speaker Pelosi named the committee’s Democratic members, including Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts as chairman. 


<p><strong>Statement of Carl Pope:</strong> "The House showed a commitment to a new direction on energy issues when it voted by a wide margin to approve H.R. 6 during its first 100 hours in session.  Yesterday, again by wide margin, Speaker Pelosi and the House reiterated this commitment by creating the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.  We applaud the dedication the new leadership in the House has shown to finding ways to end our dangerous addiction to oil, fight global warming, and invest in the clean energy solutions that will fuel the economy of tomorrow. 

<p>"We congratulate Rep. Ed Markey, a longtime friend of the Sierra Club, on his new chairmanship.  Rep. Markey has long shown his dedication to giving America the kind of energy policy it so badly needs and deserves and we look forward to his leadership on the new committee. 

<p>"Working with the other relevant committees, the select committee will be an important new tool in making progress on global warming and energy legislation in the 110th Congress.  Along with Speaker Pelosi, we hope to mark the progress of important legislative proposals by celebrating Energy Independence Day this Fourth of July."
