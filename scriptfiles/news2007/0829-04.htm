With a last minute appeal in the Texas case of Kenneth Foster pending
before the U.S. Supreme Court, Washington DC area protesters with
gather on the sidewalk in front of the High Court from 4:30pm to 6pm
EDT on Wednesday, August 29, 2007 to call for a halt to all scheduled
executions and for the abolition of the death penalty in the United
States.  This protest is one of dozens taking place throughout the
nation with regard to the case of Kenneth Foster, who was sentenced
to death despite the fact that he was not a direct participant in,
nor did he anticipate, the murder for which he is to be
killed.  Foster is scheduled to be executed in Texas at 6pm Central
time on Thursday, August 30, 2007.  If all are carried out, Foster's
execution will be the third in as many nights in Texas this week.

"We remember the victims, but not with more killing," said event
organizer Art Laffin, himself a murder victim family
member.  "Kenneth Foster is innocent of the murder of Michael LaHood.
The state of Texas has admitted that Foster did not commit the
murder. It is a simple matter of fact that Michael LaHood was killed
by Maurecio Brown, who has already been executed. The murder of
Michael LaHood  occurred when Brown left the car that Foster was
driving and got into an altercation with LaHood. Foster had no prior
knowledge that Brown would carry out this killing, but under the
state's "Law of Parties" he was convicted and sentenced to die. We
cannot let this happen."
