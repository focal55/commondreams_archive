<p>   WASHINGTON, DC - October 15 – Over 2,000 signatures from active duty, Reserve, and National Guard service 
members will be presented to Members of Congress asking for an "Appeal for Redress." Their petition states: 
 <P></P>
“As a patriotic American proud to serve the nation in uniform, I 
respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to support the 
prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq. 
Staying in Iraq will not work and is not worth the price. It is time 
for U.S. troops to come home.” 
  <P></P>
Members of the Appeal will be joined by U.S. Representatives Bob Filner--Chair of the House Veteran's Affairs Committee, Lynn Woolsey and Barbara Lee – Co-Chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, actress Eve Ensler, and author David Cortwright plus additional Members of Congress 
  <P></P>
"With recent posturing on Iran, the urgency of not repeating the 
mistakes of Iraq and ending the war becomes all the more important. 
Congress should listen to those of us who have served and continue to 
serve in the midst of a civil war," said Seaman Jonathan Hutto, 
co-founder of the Appeal for Redress. "Over 2,000 brave service men 
and women have added their voices to the vast majority of America that would like an end to this unwinnable conflict." <!-- #EndEditable -->
