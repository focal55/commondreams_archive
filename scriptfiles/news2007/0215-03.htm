<p>NEW YORK - February 15 - The Organic Trade Association and Diversified Business Communications are pleased to welcome the 45th Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, as the 2007 opening keynote speaker for the All Things OrganicÔ Conference and Trade Show.  An esteemed author, activist and political figure, former Vice President Gore will draw on his 25 years of public service to offer insights on environmental and technology issues that are reshaping everyday life and business.

<p>Since his days in the U.S. House and Senate, Al Gore's environmental record is unparalleled. In the past few years, Gore has once again emerged front and center on the national and international stage with the response to both his bestselling book and major motion picture based on it, entitled An Inconvenient Truth. Throughout his published work and public appearances, Gore confronts environmental issues in the world today and their impact on our global civilization. Arguing that the physical changes in our planet will eventually influence our global economy, he encourages business audiences to consider broader issues – environmental, social and political – when planning economic strategy.

<p>Al Gore is also an active leader in technology.  Popularizing the term "Information Superhighway" during his tenure in the House of Representatives, he went on to launch a public/private effort to wire every classroom and library in America.  He also called for the creation of a new Global Information Infrastructure—a network of networks that will send messages and images at the speed of light, across every continent, to expand access to basic phone service and communications, improve the delivery of education and health care, and create new economic opportunity around the world.  Vice President Gore's efforts continue to further technological advancements in the public and private sectors.

<p>The Gore keynote address will be a ticketed event. Please watch www.organicexpo.com for more information on ticket availability as details are confirmed.
