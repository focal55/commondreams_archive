<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 5 - Toronto - Two environmental groups that helped shape Toronto Dominion (TD) Bank's new environmental policy - Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and ForestEthics - praised the bank today for being the first in Canada to adopt a comprehensive policy to guide financing and operations. The policy sets a precedent for Canada's other major commercial banks to take stronger action on climate change, Boreal Forests and the environment.<br>&nbsp;<br>"This policy is a real leap forward for TD Bank and a first in the Canadian banking industry," said Rebecca Tarbotton, RAN's Global Finance campaign director. "When we brought these issues to TD's attention more than a year ago, they were a laggard in their sector. This policy signals not only that they are paying real attention to critical issues like global warming, but that they are willing to engage us in a meaningful consultation. That said, the ultimate test is whether we see real change in TD's financing practices and operations." <br>&nbsp;<br>TD's policy is the first comprehensive pubic environmental policy from a major Canadian bank that specifically recognizes and commits to actions relating to its operation and financing as they relate to indigenous rights, biodiversity conservation and climate change. The policy also recognizes the global significance of Canada's Boreal forest and begins to address the specific threats and opportunities associated with this national treasure.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Today's announcement by TD demonstrates financial institutions are recognizing the importance of the Boreal Forest in Ontario and across Canada as a shield against global warming," said Lafcadio Cortesi, Boreal Markets and Solutions Director at ForestEthics. "The Ontario government can harness this growing green market by protecting habitat for woodland caribou and planning before development." <br>&nbsp;<br>As part of its policy, TD will measure, report on and improve its own environmental footprint and work with its clients - including high risk industries like mining, logging, oil and gas - to assess and improve the environmental impacts and risks associated with their activities.<!-- #EndEditable -->
