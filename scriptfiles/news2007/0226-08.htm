<p style="margin-bottom: 0">BOSTON - February 26 - Amid increasing concerns about the sexualization of 
                young girls, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is 
                urging Scholastic, Inc to stop promoting the Bratz brand in 
                schools.&nbsp; Bratz dolls were recently singled out in a report by 
                the American Psychological Association for contributing to the 
                sexualization of young girls.&nbsp; CCFC launched a letter-writing 
                campaign urging Scholastic to stop selling Bratz items such as
                <i>Lil’ Bratz Dancin Divas, Lil’ Bratz Catwalk Cuties, </i>and
                <i>Lil’ Bratz Beauty Sleepover Bash</i> through its school-based 
                book fairs and book clubs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0">“Commercially-driven, sexualized stereotypes have no place in 
                school,” said CCFC’s co-founder Dr. Susan Linn, author of <i>
                Consuming Kids</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; “By allowing Scholastic to promote the 
                Bratz brand, schools undermine their own efforts to educate 
                girls to believe in themselves and nurture their academic growth 
and development.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The 
                best-selling Bratz dolls – whose wardrobes include 
                ultra-miniskirts, fishnet stockings, and bikinis – are marketed 
                to girls as young as four.&nbsp; The Bratz brand includes TV 
                programs, DVDs, web sites, accessories, clothing, and even a lap 
                top computer.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
                “The Bratz send a host of harmful messages about play, 
                appearance, sexuality, and what it means to be a young girl,” 
                said Dr. Diane Levin, professor of education at Wheelock College 
                and co-author of the upcoming <i>So Sexy, So Soon</i>.&nbsp; “They 
                teach girls to focus on appearance and fashion, to aspire to an 
                eating-disordered body, and to play at being sexy before they’re 
                even capable of understanding what sexy means.” </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
                &nbsp;“No parent wants their young daughter targeted by brands that 
                promote hyper-sexualized behavior,” said Joe Kelly, president of 
                Dads and Daughters.&nbsp; “And when the marketing takes place in 
                school, to a captive audience of students, it’s even more 
                pernicious.” </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

                Scholastic has been the target of increasing criticism because 
                so many of its in-school programs promote commercial toys and 
                media.&nbsp; In response to complaints from its members, CCFC 
                recently released <i>
                <a href="http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/bookfairs/home.htm">
                A Guide to Commercial-Free Book Fairs</a></i> which encourages 
                parents and educators to work with local booksellers to hold 
                book fairs that are free of corporate marketing and media 
                tie-ins.</p>

                is a national coalition of health care professionals, educators, 
                advocacy groups and concerned parents who counter the harmful 
                effects of marketing to children through action, advocacy, 
                education, research, and collaboration among organizations and 
                individuals who care about children.&nbsp; In 2006, CCFC and Dads and 
                Daughters led to a successful campaign to stop Hasbro from 
                producing a line of dolls based on the Pussycat Dolls, a real 
life-burlesque troupe turned music group. </i></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
