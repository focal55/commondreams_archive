<p>New York - JUNE 1 - The American Civil Liberties Union today called for an independent 
investigation into the death of a Saudi national held at the U.S. detention 
facility in Guantánamo Bay. Military officials have described the death as an 
“apparent suicide,” making it the fourth death in custody at Guantánamo in the 
past year.</p>

<p>The U.S. government has previously downplayed the significance of suicides 
and suicide attempts at Guantánamo Bay, said the ACLU. Last year, officials drew 
widespread criticism after calling the suicides of three detainees “an act of 
asymmetric warfare.”</p>
<p>“Further deaths at Guantánamo should not surprise us when prisoners are 
afforded a second class system of justice, are held indefinitely without charge, 
and are given only limited access to their lawyers,” said Anthony D. Romero, 
Executive Director of the ACLU. “Guantánamo Bay has operated for far too long 
under a shroud of secrecy. The global community and the American public have 
rightfully lost their trust in the U.S. government after countless reports of 
abuses and injustices at Guantánamo.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>“Guantánamo remains a legal black hole,” Romero added. “This is inconsistent 
with American values and must stop immediately.” </p>
<p>The ACLU has called on Congress and the Bush administration to shut down 
Guantánamo Bay. Last week, the ACLU endorsed legislation introduced by Senator 
Tom Harkin (D-IA) that would effectively end the practice of indefinite 
detention without charge or due process for detainees who have been held for as 
long as five years without knowing the reason for their detention. It would also 
provide an incentive for the government to finally charge those detainees it 
believes are guilty of crimes against the United States.</p>
<p>“The military commission system at Guantánamo Bay delivers only the illusion of 
justice,” said Jameel Jaffer, Director of the ACLU’s National Security Project. 
“Most of the prisoners have not been charged at all, and those prisoners who 
have been charged are being tried under rules that are fundamentally 
unfair.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jaffer will travel to Guantánamo Bay to observe the arraignments of Salim 
Ahmed Hamdan and Omar Khadr, both of which are scheduled to take place on 
Monday, June 4. Hamdan is a Yemeni national who is alleged to have been Osama 
bin Laden’s bodyguard and chauffeur. He is charged with conspiracy and providing 
material support to terrorism. Hamdan previously challenged the military 
commissions system in a case that reached the United States Supreme Court. In 
June 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> that the military 
commissions authorized by President Bush violated U.S. military law and 
international treaties. Following that ruling, Congress enacted the Military 
Commissions Act (MCA), which was signed by President Bush on October 17, 2006. 
Hamdan and Khadr are being tried under the MCA.</p>

<p>Khadr, a 20-year-old Canadian citizen, will be arraigned on charges of 
murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, material support and espionage. Most of 
the charges relate to a 2002 incident in Afghanistan in which Khadr is alleged 
to have thrown a grenade, killing a U.S. soldier. At the time, Khadr was 15 
years old. Khadr’s lawyers argue that he should be treated as a minor and that 
he was abused by U.S. forces at Guantánamo Bay.</p>
<p>At their respective arraignments, Khadr and Hamdan will be asked to enter 
pleas. It is not yet known how they will respond. The ACLU’s Jaffer will post 
his observations of the hearings to the ACLU’s blog at <a href="http://blog.aclu.org" target="_new" class="noline_blue">http://blog.aclu.org</a>.</p>
<p>The ACLU is one of four organizations that have been granted status as human 
rights observers at the military commission proceedings. When the tribunals 
began in 2004, Romero and two ACLU lawyers attended the proceedings and blogged 
about their observations.
