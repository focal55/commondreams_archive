<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 4 -U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) released the following statement on the Senate’s vote today on the Peru Trade Agreement:

 
<P></P>
"I am disappointed that the Congress passed another job-killing trade agreement that will shut down our factories, hurt our communities, and send more unsafe food into our kitchens and consumer products into our children's bedrooms.

 <P></P>

“The trade polices set in Washington, and negotiated across the globe, have a direct impact on places like Toledo and Steubenville, Cleveland and Hamilton. And that is why voters in my state of Ohio, and across the country, sent a message loud and clear last November, demanding a new direction for our trade policy. 

 <P></P>

“Our current trade model chases short-term profits for the few, at the expense of long-term prosperity, health and safety for the many. It’s a model that doesn’t work. Look at our trade deficit, look at manufacturing job losses, look at wage stagnation, look at imported product recalls, look at forced labor, child labor, slave labor. Look what it does to communities.

 <P></P>

“We want trade and plenty of it – but under rules that raise standards and ensure American exports have a lasting and sustainable market of consumers. Trade can be a development tool. The American people want a pro-trade, pro-development, pro-labor and forward-looking approach.”
