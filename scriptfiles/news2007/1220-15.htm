<p>ARIZONA - December 20 - <em>Today,</em> High Country News<em> reported in an article,</em> Last Chance for 
the Lobo<em>, that a ranch hand working on 
the Adobe-Slash Ranch in New Mexico abandoned a pregnant cow that was about to 
give birth in an area wolves were known to inhabit, in order to lure wolves into 
attacking livestock which would provide an excuse for removing the wolves. 
According to the article, the ranch hand knew where the wolves were by using 
radio-tracking data provided by the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS), which is meant to help ranchers avoid livestock 
losses. As the article reports, this baiting incident resulted in the lethal 
removal of the Durango pack’s 
alpha female.</em> </p>
<p><em>Below is 
a link to the full article, Defenders of Wildlife’s reaction to this news and a 
brief background on the efforts to restore the Mexican wolf to the 
Southwest.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id=17419" target="_new">http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id=17419</a></p>
<p>“If the accusations detailed in <em>Last Chance for the Lobo</em> are true, it is 
deeply disturbing that&nbsp;someone would use the very tools offered to help 
them avoid conflict with wolves as a means to derail the recovery of the Mexican 
wolf. Defenders of Wildlife has worked hard to help ranchers coexist with wolves 
through compensation,&nbsp;cooperation and trust. It appears that ranch hand 
Mike Miller abused that trust and deliberately sacrificed livestock under his 
care to force the removal of endangered wolves. </p>
<p>“If the Mexican wolf is to remain a vital part of 
the Western landscape, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must stop unethical 
individuals from abusing federal recovery programs and baiting the Mexican wolf 
into extinction. It’s time for the service to step up and recommit to their 
mission to recover endangered and threatened species. A good first step would be 
to re-double their efforts to monitor and manage this program. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Right now, one Mexican gray wolf, or lobo, is 
killed or removed from the wild for every 1.1 confirmed livestock depredations 
in the Southwest. At this rate, the lobo could once again become extinct in the 
wild in a few short years.” </p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Mexican gray wolf once roamed throughout the 
Southwest, but by the early 1970s, the lobo had been almost completely 
exterminated. In 1976, the lobo was listed as an endangered species, and shortly 
thereafter the few remaining wolves were brought into a captive-breeding program 
involving FWS and more than 40 North American zoos. In 1998, the service 
reintroduced three family groups of wolves back into the 
Apache National 
Forest in 
eastern Arizona.</p>

<p>FWS has released almost 100 Mexican wolves since 
1998. Unfortunately, a limited recovery area, heavy-handed management by the 
service, illegal poaching, and opponents who take advantage of the flexibility 
of the program have left us with only about 60 wolves in the wild today, and far 
too few breeding pairs to sustain the population.</p><p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/programs_and_policy/wildlife_conservation/imperiled_species/wolves/wolf_recovery_efforts/southwest_wolves/background_and_recovery/index.php" target="_new">Learn more about what Defenders is doing for Mexican wolves.</a></p>
