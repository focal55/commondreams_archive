<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 - The ACLU today responded to the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s 
release of its 2007 Report to Congress on Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy. 
Under current law, distribution of just five grams of crack cocaine carries a 
minimum five-year federal prison sentence; distribution of 500 grams of powder 
cocaine carries the same sentence. This 100:1 sentencing disparity has 
devastated African-American and low-income communities, targeting low-level 
offenders while failing to address the larger problem of the drug trade.</p>
<p>Among its findings, the USSC recommends that Congress:</p>


<p>· Increase the amount of crack cocaine required to trigger the 
five-year mandatory minimum sentence, as current law subjects low-level drug 
offenders to the same or harsher sentences as major dealers.</p>
<p>· Repeal the mandatory minimum penalty for simple crack cocaine 
possession.</p>
<p>· Reject proposals to lower the amount of powder cocaine required to 
trigger the five- and ten-year mandatory minimums, as the Commission finds "no 
evidence to justify such an increase."</p>
<p>"The current sentencing structure has had a disproportionate and unfair 
impact on African-American and low income communities," said Caroline 
Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office, "and we’re 
encouraged that the U.S. Sentencing Commission has once again acknowledged this 
fact. But 2007 marks the fourth time in 20 years that the commission has issued 
such a report, and Congress has yet to address the problem. Years of medical and 
legal research have shown no appreciable difference between crack and powder 
cocaine, and no justification for allowing the vast sentencing gap between them 
to stand. We urge Congress to put aside politics and act now to fix this 
discriminatory federal drug sentencing policy."</p>
