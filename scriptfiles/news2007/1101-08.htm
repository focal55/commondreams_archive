<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 1 - “The subcommittee markup of ‘America’s Climate Security may set the stage for a more serious discussion and possible action on global warming legislation, however the current version of the bill requires strengthening in three areas before Greenpeace can support the bill.
Reduction Targets:  We need to reduce our global warming emissions by an estimated 80-90 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 to avert  the most serious consequences of global warming. The legislation does not set us on a path to meet a scientifically based long-term reduction target, and should be strengthened significantly, to something on the order of 30 percent below 1990 levels.
<p></p>
Eliminating Giveaways to Polluters: As currently drafted, the bill gives the fossil fuel industry more than $400 billion in permits over 25 years. The corporate giveaway creates windfall profits, while taking vital resources away from easing America’s transition to a clean energy future. These permits must be auctioned within 10 years.  In addition, auction revenue must not be spent to promote nuclear power, advanced coal and sequestration or other energy  technologies that are not sustainable.
<p></p>
Making a Real Commitment to International Adaptation Needs: The bill as drafted provides resources to domestic adaptation needs, but neglects our moral obligations internationally.  Legislation must make significant financial commitments to help developing countries adapt to the environmental, social and economic impacts caused by global warming.  The current structure of the bill fails to provide these resources.
<p></p>
“Legislative action on global warming will require bold leadership from the Congress, and today’s subcommittee markup falls well short of that.  As the bill moves through committee and then to the Senate floor, it is our hope that the bill will be strengthened to ensure that it meets the scale of reductions that scientists tell us are necessary.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
