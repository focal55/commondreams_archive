<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - President Bush today exercised his executive authority to lift the ban on drilling off the southwest coast of Alaska in the fragile, salmon-rich waters of Bristol Bay. Bristol Bay, one of the world's most productive marine systems for fish, marine mammals and migratory birds, has enjoyed federal protection since the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989.

<p>In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope issued the following
statement:

<p>"Bristol Bay is one the most important fisheries in America and in the world.  It's incredibly reckless to risk such an outstanding natural resource just to satisfy Big Oil.  Most Alaskans and Americans would agree that it doesn't make sense to sacrifice the world's largest salmon run and an entire local economy to give the oil industry another gift on its wish list.

<p>"This move will do nothing to lower gas prices for American families or energy costs for American businesses, and will keep our nation dangerously dependent on oil.  By contrast, if our cars, trucks and SUVs together averaged 40 miles per gallon - something that is achievable with existing technology - we would save as much oil as the United States currently imports from the Persian Gulf, with another million barrels to spare."

<p><b>Background
</b>
<p>Bristol Bay is home to the world's largest wild salmon run, high value red king crab, large pollock and cod fisheries, huge herring schools that sustain the Bering Sea, and a primary halibut nursery ground. This rich marine life could be harmed by the seismic testing, potential oil spills, and contaminated drilling muds and produced water associated with offshore drilling. The region's residents are heavily dependent on the local marine life for both direct sustenance through subsistence and for sustainable livelihoods through commercial fishing.

<p>Bristol Bay is an economically-critical salmon fishery, with an estimated net present value as high as $10 billion, and the area is prized by sportsmen for its salmon and halibut fishing opportunities.  Its lush wetlands support vast bird populations and it provides essential habitat for the endangered Right whale.

<p>More than 25 million fish are harvested (commercial, sport and subsistence) annually, contributing more than $300 million and providing some 12,500 jobs. Sport fishermen eager to test the famed fishing grounds spend about $120 million a year.

<p>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) recently completed a public comment period, including more than 10 public hearings in Alaska, on their draft Five-Year OCS Leasing Program that proposes opening Bristol Bay in 2010. Ten years ago, Alaska bought back oil company drilling rights after an outcry that drilling could damage the state's most important salmon run. Bush rescinded President Clinton's longstanding "Executive OCS Leasing Withdrawals" that were to protect Alaska's fragile North Aleutian Basin (Bristol Bay) until June 30, 2012.  A similar bipartisan congressional OCS moratorium protected Bristol Bay starting with the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 until Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) led an effort to lift the ban in 2003. Today's announcement could spur action to reinstate the congressional moratorium.
