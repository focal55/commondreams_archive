<p>WASHINGTON - December 11 - United States negotiators have objected to language in the draft Bali Roadmap text on “sufficient, predictable, additional, and sustainable” adaptation funding for vulnerable countries.
<div class="intro">This US position is shocking and shows a dramatic disregard for the world’s vulnerable&nbsp; and&nbsp; poor&nbsp; who are bearing the brunt of climate change. The US approach is to undermine progress on funding for developing countries in the Bali Roadmap which sets the framework for negotiations on climate change over the next two years.</div>
<p>Now, the latest&nbsp; draft of the Bali Roadmap text strips out that language, undermining&nbsp; negotiations&nbsp; and&nbsp; condemning poor and vulnerable people to deepening poverty.<br><br>The need for adequate and rapidly scaled up sources of adaptation funding is clear. The World Bank has estimated the annual needs of developing countries&nbsp; to adapt to climate change is up to $40 billion, Oxfam puts this figure at a minimum of $50 billion annually, while the UN Development Program said last week that the costs are $86 billion a year.<br><br>Despite being the world’s largest historical emitter of global greenhouse gases, the US has contributed&nbsp; exactly US$0 to the multilateral funds created under the UNFCCC.<br><br>Now, US negotiators are saying “NO” to the idea that it’s time for developed countries to fulfill their commitments under the UNFCCC by making sure that developing countries receive adequate funding.<br><br>We join forces to say "NO" to the US position, which undermines an overall deal in Bali, and we instead call on governments to strengthen the Bali Roadmap text in the next day by ensuring it:</p>

<ul><li>Includes “sufficient, predictable, additional and sustainable” funding;</li><li>Provides for new and rapidly scaled up funding sources; and<br></li><li>Creates binding commitments for developed countries to provide adaptation funding.</li></ul>
