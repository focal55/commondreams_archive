<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 3 -  Melanie Sloan, legal counsel to Joe and Valerie Wilson in their civil suit against Vice President Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby and Richard Armitage, released the following statement yesterday in response to President Bush’s decision to commute Mr. Libby’s sentence.

<P></P>“First, President Bush said any person who leaked would no longer work in his administration. Nonetheless, Scooter Libby didn’t leave office until he was indicted and Karl Rove works in the White House even today. More recently, the vice president ignored an executive order protecting classified information, claiming he isn’t really part of the executive branch. Clearly, this is an administration that believes leaking classified information for political ends is justified and that the law is what applies to other people.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
