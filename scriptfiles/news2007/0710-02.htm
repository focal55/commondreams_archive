<p>TRENTON, NJ  - JULY 10 -  The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has
formally rejected a petition to give the public notice of its meetings
with lobbyists and to post appointment calendars of its top officials,
according to an agency ruling released today by Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility (PEER).&nbsp; The action by DEP
Commissioner Lisa Jackson was dated the same day, July 2, 2007, the
PEER petition for rulemaking was first published for public review in
the July 2, 2007 New Jersey Register. <br>
<br>

"I guess the negative consequences of official secrecy is something
that DEP does not think merits any serious thought or the slightest bit
of public input," stated New Jersey PEER Director Bill Wolfe, noting
Commissioner Jackson claimed that her same-day decision came only
"after careful consideration."&nbsp; "The public should know who DEP is
meeting with to discuss protection of public health and the
environment.&nbsp; Given several recent examples of behind-the-scenes
shenanigans with politically-connected insiders, a little sunshine is
more than warranted." <br>
<br>
The PEER petition urged three major changes to promote openness in DEP decision-making:<br>
<br>
Notice of Meetings. DEP convenes closed-door
meetings with lobbyists and designated insiders with no public
attendance or publication of meeting agendas.&nbsp; Jackson's refusal
claimed meetings must stay confidential as a matter of "executive
privilege and the deliberative process privilege"; <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>

Publication of Top Officials' Calendars. The DEP
Commissioner and top deputies routinely make decisions on enforcement
and other pollution control policies in meetings with corporate
lobbyists and executives, often from the same companies that are
charged with violations.&nbsp; Jackson defended shielding appointment
calendars on the grounds that it "implicates the privacy interests" of
attendees.&nbsp; Tellingly, she also argued that revealing the
"identity and the sequence of the persons with whom the Department
senior staff consult could reveal the substance or direction or the
mental processes of the Commissioner and Department staff"; and&nbsp;
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
Repeal Gag Orders Forbidding Staff from Answering
Questions by Media and Public. Under current DEP rules, agency
scientists and other specialists are barred from speaking without prior
approval from the agency Press Office.&nbsp; Jackson maintained that
any "issues" should be raised within the chain-of-command, noting that
there are also whistleblower statutes.&nbsp; New Jersey whistleblower
law does not, however, protect employee disclosures about threats to
public health, manipulation of science or gross mismanagement, among
other topics.</li>
  <li>

As a matter of both law and policy, the federal government and many
states make available the same calendar and meeting information sought
by the PEER petition.&nbsp; Further, lobbyist communications are
considered part of the public record by federal agencies and most
states.&nbsp; Moreover, the DEP assertion of "privacy interests" of
lobbyists runs counter to New Jersey Election Law Enforcement
Commission rules which require disclosure of any communications with
DEP managers. </li>
</ul>



<br>
"The DEP is supposed to be doing the people's business so its internal
workings should be able to withstand public scrutiny," Wolfe added,
noting the parallels between the positions taken on the need for
secrecy by Commissioner Jackson and Vice President Dick Cheney. "It is
precisely because so many DEP decisions are inexplicable that the
public needs to know what 'mental processes' could have possibly
produced them."<br>
