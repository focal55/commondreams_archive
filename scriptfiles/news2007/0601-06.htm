<p>ARIZONA - JUNE 1 - The June 6 trial in U.S. District Court, Tucson, for two 
Roman Catholic priests arrested at a protest last November at Fort 
Huachuca has been postponed.  Instead, Fr. Louis Vitale and Fr. 
Stephen Kelly have been ordered to appear at 9 a.m. that same day in 
U.S. Magistrate Hector Estrada's court for a hearing on pretrial 
motions.

  	<P></P>Supporters of the priests will join them at 8:00 a.m. 
Wednesday, June 6, for a brief morning support rally in the courtyard 
in front of the U.S. District Court, 405 W. Congress St.

	<P></P>It is anticipated that military prosecutor Capt. Evan Simone 
may reintroduce a motion to have the priests jailed pending trial, 
for which a new date will be set at the June 6 hearing.  The two are 
charged with federal trespass and an Arizona state charge of failure 
to comply with a police officer following their attempt to speak with 
enlisted personnel and deliver a letter denouncing torture and the 
Military Commissions Act of 2006 to Major General Barbara Fast, 
commander at Fort Huachuca, on November 19, 2006.

	<P></P>On Tuesday, June 5, supporters are invited to join the 
defendants and others for a Festival of Hope for a future free from 
the terror and injustice of torture.  The Festival of Hope begins at 
6 p.m. at St. Mark's Presbyterian Church, 3809 E. 3rd St., Tucson. A 
potluck meal in Geneva Hall will be followed by a 7 p.m. program in 
the church sanctuary. Speakers at the Festival of Hope will include 
torture survivor Orlando Tizon, (Assistant Director, Torture 
Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition International), human 
rights attorney William Quigley (Loyola University, New Orleans), 
retired U.S. Army Colonel and diplomat Ann Wright, and defendants Fr. 
Louis Vitale and Fr. Stephen Kelly.  Music will be provided by San 
Francisco cultural worker Francisco Herrera and Tucson musician Ted 
Warmbrand.

	<P></P>The defendants and all of the speakers will be available for 
media interviews in midtown Tucson on Tuesday afternoon, June 5. 
Please call 323-8697 for arrangements.

<P></P>BIOGRAPHIES:
  <P></P>Fr. Louis Vitale, OFM
	<P></P>With a background in sociology and a focus on the Sociology 
of Religion and social movements, Louie is a long time social 
activist. A Franciscan priest who served as the provincial of the 
California Franciscan Friars from 1979 to 1988, he co-founded the 
Nevada Desert Experience and its enduring movement to end nuclear 
testing. He recently completed twelve years as the pastor of St. 
Boniface Catholic Church in a low-income neighborhood in San 
Francisco, California. He earned his Ph.D. in Sociology at the 
University of California, Los Angeles.
	<P></P>In 2006, Louie completed a six month sentence for his 
nonviolent action to close the School of the Americas/WHINSEC at Ft. 
Benning, GA in 2006. He is currently the "Action Advocate" for Pace e 
Bene and is involved in trying to raise awareness about issues of 
torture and U.S. involvement in it.

  <P></P>Fr. Stephen Kelly, SJ
	<P></P>Fr. Kelly is a Jesuit priest who worked with the Jesuit 
Refugee service in Central America for many years. He has spent time 
in federal prison for nonviolent direct disarmament actions.  These 
"Plowshares" actions have brought him into contact with many in 
prisons who have suffered under U.S. hegemonic policies. In an 
attempt to dedicate himself to conversion of nuclear weapons in the 
Isaiah biblical prophetic vision, he sees a connection between the 
rationale to torture alleged enemies and the blatant incineration of 
civilians. In December, 2005, Kelly served as chaplain for Witness 
Against Torture, a delegation of over two dozen U.S. anti-torture 
activists who defied the U.S. embargo of Cuba with a peaceful march 
through that nation to the gates of the Guantanamo Bay naval base and 
prison camp.

<P></P>Orlando Tizon
	<P></P>Orlando Tizon was arrested on September 21, 1982 in Davao 
City, in the island of Mindanao, southern Philippines, during the 
regime of President Marcos.  At that time he was working as  a 
community organizer and educator among the rural poor in the 
Philippines.  During the first three weeks of his imprisonment, the 
military who arrested him kept him blindfolded and incommunicado in a 
military camp outside Davao City.  He suffered beatings, endless 
interrogations, mock execution and solitary confinement for more than 
three months.  On April, 1986 after the people power revolution, the 
Aquino government granted him amnesty and released him from prison. 
Soon after, he emigrated to the U.S., went for treatment and therapy 
and attended graduate school, later earning a doctorate in sociology.
	<P></P>His interests lie in the issues concerning torture and 
political violence, race/ethnic relations, immigrants and refugees 
and human rights. Presently, he is the Assistant Director of the 
Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition International 
(TASSC) in Washington, D.C.

<P></P>William Quigley
	<P></P>Bill Quigley, lawyer for Fr. Louis Vitale, is a law professor 
and Director of the Law Clinic and the Gillis Long Poverty Law Center 
at Loyola University New Orleans. Bill has been an active public 
interest lawyer since 1977.  He served as counsel with a wide range 
of public interest organizations concerned with Katrina social 
justice issues, public housing, voting rights, death penalty, living 
wage, civil liberties, educational reform, constitutional rights and 
civil disobedience. 	Bill teaches in the Law Clinic and teaches 
courses in Law and Poverty and Catholic Social Teaching and Law.  He 
has served as an advisor on human and civil rights to Human Rights 
Watch USA, Amnesty International USA, and served as the Chair of the 
Louisiana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. 
He has also been an active volunteer lawyer with School of the 
Americas Watch and the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. 
In 2003, he was named the Pope Paul VI National Teacher of Peace by 
Pax Christi USA and is the recipient of the 2004 SALT Teaching Award 
presented by the Society of American Law Teachers.

<P></P>Ann Wright
	<P></P>Col. Ann Wright (U.S. Army, Ret.) served 29 years in the 
military and 16 years in the diplomatic corps, including as Deputy 
Ambassador at four missions. Among her many posts, Ms. Wright 
reopened the U.S. Embassy in Kabul in December, 2001. She resigned in 
March, 2003 in opposition to the Iraq war. Wright now works full-time 
as an advocate for peace and human rights, challenging politicians 
and military leaders in Washington to oppose the occupation of Iraq 
and the Military Commissions Act.  She has traveled the country 
speaking about and lending support to soldiers who refuse to fight in 
Iraq. In August, 2006, she traveled to Amman, Jordan to talk with 
Iraqi parliamentarians about their peace plan, and participated in 
the Close Guantanamo delegation that traveled to Cuba in January, 
2007.
