<p>   October 11 – Today we congratulate Congressman Blumenauer (D-OR), along with co-sponsors Congressmen Oberstar (D-MN), Duncan (R-TN), Gilchrest (R-MD), EB Johnson (D-TX), Hall (D-NY), and Dingell (D-MI), for their leadership in making clean water a national priority by introducing House Resolution 725.
<p></p>
One week before the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act- one of America’s most important laws for protecting the environment and human health – these clean water champions are calling on Congress to recommit federal support for clean, safe, affordable water for all Americans.
<p></p>
The resolution celebrates the progress made since the passage of the Clean Water Act, yet acknowledges the critical crossroads our clean water infrastructure is currently facing. Some of our sewer systems are more than 100 years old, and pipes under our homes and streets are deteriorating at a rapid rate. According to House Resolution 725, we will need between $300 and $400 billion over the next 20 years to maintain and improve wastewater infrastructure.
<p></p>
Despite this sobering reality, federal funding for clean water has become an annual political battle. Given the history of fickle year-to-year funding and the urgency of our water infrastructure troubles, Congress should create a clean water trust fund that would provide a steady, reliable, and equitable source of funding for needed infrastructure investment across the country.
<p></p>
National priorities that transcend state and local boundaries should receive perpetual funding streams, immune from shifting political currents. Clean water, an essential public resource for all Americans, certainly warrants federal support. The American public agrees, with 86% supporting legislation that would create long-term and sustainable funding for clean water infrastructure.
<p></p>
We encourage Congress to not only listen to their constituents and vote to protect our nation’s clean water infrastructure, but also to work for a solution that will keep politics out of critical infrastructure financing.
<p></p>
It’s time for Congress to create a trust fund that protects our water and keeps it clean and safe for the next thirty-five years and beyond.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
