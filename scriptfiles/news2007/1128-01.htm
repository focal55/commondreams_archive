<strong>WHEN:</strong> Friday, November 30, 2007 – 1:15 PM
<P></P>
<strong>WHERE:</strong> Lafayette Park, 16th and H Streets, N.W., Washington, DC
<P></P>
On November 30th, the eve of World AIDS Day, hundreds of activists for a
rally outside The White House to urge a comprehensive response to the
HIV/AIDS pandemic that has claimed 20 million lives to date. This event
will be a striking photo opportunity as protesters drape Lafayette Park
with hundreds of feet of red tape and call on President Bush and the
Congress to “cut the red tape” around access to comprehensive prevention
and treatment of HIV and AIDS at home and abroad.
<P></P>
Friday’s event will feature prominent speakers and religious leaders who
wish to emphasize the local, national and global connections on
HIV/AIDS. The recent release of the 2007 UNAIDS Update and the District
of Columbia HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Annual Report 2007 have striking
numbers that illustrate the breath of the pandemic and demonstrate the
disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on Africa and people of color in
America. Washington, DC now has the highest HIV/AIDS rate in the
country, with one in 20 residents testing positive.
<P></P>
This event commemorates World AIDS Day. This year’s theme is
“Leadership”. The speakers at the rally will urge greater U.S.
leadership in the local, national and global fight to end AIDS. The
specific demands are: Local – Ensure that all DC students receive a
medically accurate and unbiased comprehensive sexuality education that
includes lessons on HIV/AIDS. National – Implement a comprehensive
national HIV/AIDS strategy. Global – Commit at least $50 billion over
five years to fight global AIDS including $8 billion to train and retain
health care workers and an amendment to strike the abstinence earmark.

The rally is sponsored by Act-UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power),
Advocates for Youth, Africa Action, American Medical Students
Association, Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE), DC Fights
Back, Global AIDS Alliance, Jubilee USA Network, MetroTeenAIDS, RESULTS,
