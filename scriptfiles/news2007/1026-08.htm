<p>WASHINGTON, DC - October 26 - Leaders of the largest healthcare union in the nation today celebrated the House passage of SCHIP legislation that would provide health coverage for nearly 10 million uninsured children, and expressing outrage at President Bush’s threat to once again veto the bill.
<p></p>
SEIU Healthcare Chair Dennis Rivera praised the grassroots support for the bill and said that President Bush’s threats of another veto place him at odds with the vast majority of Americans who think we should be looking for ways to cover more people, especially children.
<p></p>
“Today’s vote should be a great victory for our children, and for every citizen who stood up for their friends and neighbors to make this vote happen,” said Rivera.  ”It’s appalling that President Bush would ignore that support and once again try to block 10 million kids from getting the healthcare they need.” 
<p></p>
Anna Burger, Secretary-Treasurer of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), said that the legislation would not have passed without the enormous pressure brought by healthcare workers, parents, advocates, and others across America who rallied in support of healthcare – and that this same force would be mobilized to continue that pressure if the measure is vetoed.
<p></p>
“President Bush must not stand in the way of what the American people have so clearly stated they want – health care for children,” Burger said.  “But if he dares to try, rest assured that we will not stop until we can get health coverage for these kids.”
<p></p>
Burger and Rivera said that SEIU would expand the existing grassroots and advertising campaign supporting the SCHIP legislation, targeting Representatives who voted against health care for kids.  To date, SEIU has spent $1.9 million on print, radio, and television ads, collected over 1 million petition signatures, helped tens of thousands of people to send emails and make phone calls into congressional offices, and orchestrated hundreds of press conferences, rallies, and vigils in targeted districts around the country.
