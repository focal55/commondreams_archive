<P>ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico - February 5 - The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit today 
against the state of New Mexico on behalf of three lesbian couples seeking 
retirement health insurance for the domestic partners of lesbian and gay state 
employees.&nbsp; </P>
<P>"After serving the state for 25 years, I hoped to retire with the same peace 
of mind as my straight colleagues," said Ellen Novak.&nbsp;&nbsp; "But 
retirement has meant that my partner has had to switch to costly private health 
insurance with inferior coverage at the point in our lives when we are most 
likely to face health problems.&nbsp; I worked just as hard as my colleagues, so 
it doesn't seem fair that my family has been saddled with this burden."&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Novak, who has been with her partner Linda McCreary for 15 years, was forced 
to retire in 2004 after being diagnosed with a chronic lung condition.&nbsp; 
When she was still working for the state, she was able to provide McCreary 
health insurance as her domestic partner, but because of the state's unfair 
policy of denying retirees domestic partner coverage, McCreary's domestic 
partner coverage was terminated when Novak was forced to retire.&nbsp; Married 
couples in the same situation are permitted to continue to provide health 
insurance to their spouses after retirement.</P>
<P>The lawsuit filed today charges that the state's policy of denying lesbian 
and gay state retirees equal health insurance for their partners violates the 
state constitution's equality guarantees.&nbsp; Unlike their straight 
colleagues, lesbian and gay employees are barred from marrying in the state and 
therefore, in the absence of domestic partner benefits, are denied equal 
compensation.&nbsp; </P>
<P>"Lesbian and gay employees make commitments and form families just like 
straight employees, and their families have the same needs," said Peter 
Simonson, Executive Director of the ACLU of New Mexico.&nbsp; "Health insurance 
is an important portion of how employees are compensated.&nbsp; It's not right 
for the state to take care of straight families, but to force gay and lesbian 
families to bear the significant expense and suffer the inferior coverage of 
private health insurance at the point in their lives when they need health care 
most."&nbsp; </P>
<P>In 2003, Governor Bill Richardson issued an executive order providing state 
employees, both gay and straight, with the option of providing their partners 
health insurance through domestic partner coverage.&nbsp; Under the order, 
domestic partner coverage is not available to employees after they retire, while 
spousal coverage is provided.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Proposed legislation, SB 502, which was introduced by Senator John Grubesic 
and will be the subject of a committee hearing this Wednesday, would close the 
loophole and provide benefits to the domestic partners of retired 
employees.&nbsp; </P>
<P>"The state legislature has the opportunity to spare taxpayers the needless 
expense of defending this lawsuit by passing this bill," said Simonson.&nbsp; 
"The cost of providing the domestic partners of state employees with access to 
retirement health insurance would only result in less than a one percent 
increase in claims dollars paid out by the authority.&nbsp; And this nominal 
cost would likely be offset by the savings to the state on account of having 
more people insured."&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The other two couples involved in the lawsuit are:</P>
<P><STRONG>Havens Levitt and Rebecca Dakota</STRONG> -- This Albuquerque couple has been together 
for 11 years, but have know each other for 25.&nbsp; Levitt, 54, has been a 
teacher for more than 23 years with the Albuquerque public school system.&nbsp; 
Dakota, 52, works for an anti-smoking campaign and as the part-time director of 
the Albuquerque Independent Business Alliance.&nbsp; Because her jobs are both 
part-time, she relies on Levitt to provide her health insurance.&nbsp; When 
Levitt retires, Dakota will no longer have access to health insurance and will 
be forced to pay for private insurance, which is especially expensive for 
someone of her age.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Mary Meyer and Hope Miner</STRONG>&nbsp; -- This Sandoval County couple has been 
together for 13 years and is raising two children together.&nbsp; Meyer, who 
manages the WIC Nutrition Program for Bernalillo and Sandoval Counties, has 
worked for the New Mexico Department of Health for 22 years.&nbsp; Miner retired 
from the Albuquerque school system in 2003 after serving as an elementary 
teacher for 25 years.&nbsp; When domestic partner benefits became available, the 
couple decided to have Meyer cover Miner as a domestic partner in order to avoid 
the double fees the couple had to pay towards their separate health plans.&nbsp; 
After Miner retired, the couple learned that the domestic partner coverage would 
no longer be available once Meyer retired.&nbsp; When Meyer retires, the 
couple's monthly expenses will increase because they will both be required to 
contribute to their own health plans.</P>
<P>The legal team for the ACLU in Novak and McCreary v. New Mexico is George 
Bach, staff attorney with the ACLU of New Mexico, Ken Choe, a senior staff 
attorney with the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project of the ACLU, and 
cooperating attorney Maureen Sanders of Sanders &amp; Westbrook, P.C.</P>
