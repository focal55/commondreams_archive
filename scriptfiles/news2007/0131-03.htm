<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold today introduced 
          the Iraq Redeployment Act of 2007. Feingold&#8217;s bill uses Congress&#8217;s 
          power of the purse to force the President to safely redeploy U.S. troops 
          from Iraq by prohibiting funds for continued operations six months after 
          enactment. Feingold&#8217;s legislation allows for specific operations 
          to continue in Iraq beyond six months, including counter-terrorism efforts, 
          protection of U.S. personnel and infrastructure, and training of Iraqi 
          security forces. The six-month timeframe provides the President with 
          adequate time to safely redeploy the troops from Iraq.
<p>&#8220;By passing my legislation, Congress can respond to the will 
          of the American people and force the President to safely bring our forces 
          out of Iraq,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;With the President set on 
          pursuing his failed policies in Iraq, Congress has the duty to stand 
          up and use its power to stop him. If Congress doesn&#8217;t stop this 
          war, it&#8217;s not because it doesn&#8217;t have the power -- it&#8217;s 
          because it doesn&#8217;t have the will.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Feingold&#8217;s bill is the latest effort in his long record of opposing 
          the President&#8217;s flawed Iraq policy. In August 2005, Feingold, 
          who opposed the authorization to use force in Iraq, became the first 
          Senator to propose a timeline to bring an end to U.S. involvement in 
          Iraq. Yesterday, Feingold chaired a full Judiciary Committee hearing 
          where a diverse panel of constitutional scholars testified that Congress 
          does indeed have the power to end a war.</p>
        <p>&#8220;From the beginning, this war has been a mistake, and the policies 
          that have carried it out have been a failure,&#8221; Feingold said. 
          &#8220;Congress must not allow the President to continue a war that 
          has already come at such a terrible cost. We have the constitutional 
          authority and the moral responsibility to end our involvement in Iraq 
          so we can refocus on those who attacked us on 9/11.&#8221;</p>

<strong>FACT SHEET: IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT ACT OF 2007</strong>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Congress can, and has, used the power of the purse to 
          restrict presidential war power. If members of Congress are worried 
          about American troops fighting for their lives in a futile war, those 
          lives are not protected by voting for continued funding. The proper 
          and responsible action is to terminate appropriations and bring the 
          troops home.&#8221;</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p><em><strong><u>Feingold&#8217;s legislation:</u></strong></em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prohibits the use of funds for continued deployment of U.S. Armed 
            Forces to the Republic of Iraq after six months of enactment. In other 
            words, the President would have to redeploy troops safely by that 
            date.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Requires the Administration to report to Congress, within 60 days 
            of enactment, a strategy for safely redeploying U.S. forces from Iraq 
            within the six months prior to the fund termination date. <br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Provides specific exceptions to the prohibition for: <br>
            <ul>
              <br>
              <li>Conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations in Iraq.<br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Allowing a limited number of U.S. forces to conduct specific 
                training for Iraqi security services. <br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Providing security for U.S. infrastructure and civilian personnel. 
              </li>
              <br>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Does <u>not</u> prohibit funds for any department or agency of the 
            Government of the United States to carry out political, economic, 
            or general reconstruction activities in Iraq. <br></li><br>
          <li>Does <u>not</u> prevent any U.S. troops from receiving salaries, 
            equipment, training and other resources. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>On numerous occasions, Congress has exercised its constitutional 
          authority to end military engagements. Here are just a few examples:</em></p>
        <p>Cambodia &#8211; In late December 1970, Congress passes the Supplemental 
          Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act prohibiting the use of funds to 
          finance the introduction of United States ground combat troops into 
          Cambodia or to provide U.S. advisors to or for Cambodian military forces 
          in Cambodia. </p>
        <p>Vietnam &#8211; In late June 1973, Congress passes the second Supplemental 
          Appropriations Act for FY1973. This legislation contains language cutting 
          off funds for combat activities in Vietnam after August 15, 1973. </p>
        <p>Somalia &#8211; In November 1993, the Department of Defense Appropriations 
          Act includes a provision that prohibits funding after March 31, 1994 
          for military operations in Somalia, except for a limited number of military 
          personnel to protect American diplomatic personnel and American citizens, 
          unless further authorized by Congress. </p>
        <p>Bosnia &#8211; In 1998, Congress passes the Defense Authorization Bill, 
          with a provision that prohibits funding for Bosnia after June 30, 1998, 
unless the President makes certain assurances. </p><!-- #EndEditable -->
