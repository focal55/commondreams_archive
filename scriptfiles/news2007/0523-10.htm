<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 23 -YearlyKos Convention organizers announced today that Sen. John Edwards, Sen. Barack Obama, and Gov. Bill Richardson confirmed their participation in a Presidential Leadership Forum to be held August 4 in Chicago. Confirmations from other candidates are forthcoming.</p>
<p>Organizers say the event—the first ever collaborative presidential forum with both a respected blogger and a leading member of the traditional media as moderators—is an opportunity to use technology to empower citizens to engage and evaluate America's potential leaders, both face-to-face and online. Many political candidates, including Edwards and Obama, already frequently use sites like Daily Kos to dialogue with the public.</p>
<p>Matt Bai, writer for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> and author of a book on Democratic politics to be released in August, and Joan McCarter, contributing editor at Daily Kos, will moderate. Author and blogger Dr. Jeffrey Feldman will facilitate questions from convention attendees and those submitted in advance from tens of thousands of blog readers.</p>
<p>"This year we are honored to add the YearlyKos Presidential Leadership Forum to the slate of events scheduled at the YearlyKos Convention," said YearlyKos Convention Executive Director Gina Cooper. "The forum is an opportunity to have a discussion about the issues that matter and hear detailed responses to the questions America needs answered."</p>

<p>Organizers are asking candidates to spend time in intimate, unscripted citizen dialogues with attendees, encouraging substantive discussions that transcend the competitive nature of most joint appearances on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>"We live in an Internet age with an abundance of information, and while we can visit a website to read about a candidate's policies or hear the latest speech, there is still no substitute for real live answers to real life questions," said Cooper. "We are thrilled to be able to provide an opportunity for progressive bloggers and activists to participate in that experience."</p>
<p>YearlyKos Convention 2007 will take place August 2–5, 2007 at the McCormick Place Convention Center in Chicago, Illinois. In addition to the forum, the conference will include panels and caucuses led by national and international experts; prominent nationally recognized political, issue and policy-oriented speakers; a progressive film screening series; and the most concentrated gathering of high-profile progressive bloggers to date.</p>
<p>The forum and convention are open to media coverage. For more information about the YearlyKos Convention or for credentials, visit <a href="http://www.yearlykosconvention.org/press" title="http://www.yearlykosconvention.org/press" target="_new">http://www.yearlykosconvention.org/press</a>.</p>
