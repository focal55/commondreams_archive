<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 15 -  Africa Action calls on
President Bush to publicly re-affirm a U.S. commitment to the
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between North
and South Sudan at today’s meeting with South Sudan leader, Salva Kiir.
This morning’s meeting will address both the shaky implementation of the
CPA and the Darfur crisis.
<p></p>
President Bush is expected to encourage Mr. Kiir to accept a proposal
that would bring in China, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to negotiate a new
“package deal” to resolve the current impasse around border demarcation
and the oil-rich Abyei region. The assumption is that this new deal will
be more favorable to Khartoum than the CPA. Africa Action emphasized
that the CPA already includes provisions that explicitly identify the
North-South boarder and address Abyei, so this new U.S. proposal would
overturn these important elements of the North-South peace agreement by
creating a new process for a new arrangement, destabilizing this
carefully constructed and signed accord.
<p></p>
“President Bush will no longer be able to take credit for the 2005 peace
deal if the U.S. now undermines its implementation. Bush must be willing
to stand up to Bashir and stand by the original CPA. The proposed
‘confidence building measures’ would create a new process that undercuts
this fragile agreement,” said Gerald LeMelle, Executive Director of
Africa Action, “Furthermore, as the CPA falters, the international
community can no longer segregate its approach to Darfur and South Sudan
or ignore impoverished and disenfranchised people elsewhere in the
largest country in Africa. The U.S. must reformulate its approach to
Sudan, putting equal emphasis on a resolution to the genocide in Darfur
and the full implementation of the peace agreement that ended the
longest running civil war between North and South Sudan.”
<p></p>
Africa Action noted that South Sudan, Darfur and communities in each
region of the country strive for some common goals including
power-sharing, increased democratization of the political system and
equitable access and control of resources. Africa Action further
acknowledges that notwithstanding some similarities there are also
distinct differences in each of these conflicts, making it essential for
the U.S. to put equal emphasis on solutions to each while honoring all
of the unique circumstances.
<p></p>
“The U.S. must begin to prioritize peace throughout Sudan and apply
diplomatic leverage towards achieving the immediate deployment to Darfur
of a multinational peacekeeping force under the command and control of
the United Nations, an inclusive and comprehensive Darfur peace
negotiation and the full implementation of the CPA. President Bush must
not sacrifice peace in Sudan to feed the War on Terror. It is time to
break the ties that bind Bush and Bashir and for the U.S. to impose
consequences for non-compliance with the signed North-South agreement
and any further destruction in Darfur,” said Marie Clarke Brill, Deputy
Director of Africa Action.
