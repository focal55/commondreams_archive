<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 1 - The United Nations (UN)
Security Council voted unanimously yesterday to authorize a hybrid
African Union (AU)-UN peacekeeping force for Darfur. This move comes
more than a month after Sudan stated its agreement for this deployment,
nearly nine months after a hybrid force was first proposed, and almost
three years since the U.S. acknowledged that the crisis in Darfur
constitutes genocide.
<P></P>
Today, Africa Action emphasized that Khartoum must be held accountable
to its commitments, that the process of deployment must begin
immediately, and that the U.S. must demonstrate leadership in working
towards a peacekeeping deployment.
<P></P>
Following objections from Khartoum, the text of the initial draft
resolution had been watered down, notably to remove reference to new
sanctions on Sudan should the peacekeeping force be obstructed. However,
the resolution retains language authorizing the force with a Chapter 7
mandate, allowing the peacekeepers to use force to protect civilians.
<P></P>
The UN resolution authorizes a deployment of 26,000, creating the
world’s largest peacekeeping mission, and will boost the current AU
peacekeeping force of 7,000. Reports indicate that Nigeria, Uganda and
Rwanda will be major troop contributors, and significant financial
support will be required from the international community. Current UN
projections state that the first troops will arrive in October, with the
expectation to achieve full strength by the end of 2007.
<P></P>
Nii Akuetteh, Executive Director of Africa Action, said today, “This
resolution expresses the commitment of the UN to protecting the people
of Darfur. But it remains to be seen whether rigorous action will now be
taken to ensure deployment. The U.S. must now play a leadership role in
providing adequate funding, in supplying logistical support, and in
soliciting international troop contributions and other political
support. The people of Darfur cannot continue to be denied protection
because of diplomatic obstacles and bureaucratic delays.”
<P></P>
In the aftermath of the resolution, the Sudanese ambassador to the UN
Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad said that Khartoum would uphold its
obligations. Africa Action warned that the Sudanese government has often
stated its commitment to peacekeeping and to a resolution to the
violence in Darfur, yet stalled progress during international negotiations.
<P></P>
In recent weeks, reports have increasingly emerged of attacks on
humanitarian operations and food convoys, severely hampering the ability
of aid workers to deliver life-sustaining support to displaced people.
Africa Action stressed that the deployment of a peacekeeping mission is
urgently needed to stabilize these conditions and create a secure
environment favorable to successful peace negotiations.
