<p>DENVER - February 6 - The American Civil Liberties Union today asked the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to protect teens&#8217; access to confidential 
reproductive health care.&nbsp; In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the 
court, the ACLU said an opinion issued by the former Attorney General of Kansas 
intimidates teens from seeking medical care, and puts their health and safety at 
risk.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&#8220;Forcing health care providers to report all consensual sexual 
activity of teens has nothing to do with protecting their health and safety and 
everything to do with furthering a political agenda,&#8221; said Brigitte Amiri, a 
staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.&nbsp; &#8220;Mandatory 
reporting will actually discourage teens from seeking reproductive health 
care.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
In June 2003, former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline issued an 
opinion that radically changed state law to require health care providers who 
are mandatory reporters of sexual abuse to report all sexual activity of teens 
under 16 years of age - including consensual sexual activity between teens of 
the same age.&nbsp; The Attorney General&#8217;s interpretation of the law would have 
resulted in a government information bank that parents could periodically check 
to determine whether their son or daughter had sought reproductive health 
care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
A district court ruled in April 2006 that the 
Attorney General&#8217;s interpretation of the mandatory reporting statute violates 
teens&#8217; constitutional rights, and that such reporting will force many minors to 
forgo reproductive health care altogether.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;The government cannot 
mandate good family communication,&#8221; said Brett Shirk, Executive Director of the 
ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri.&nbsp; &#8220;State surveillance of teens&#8217; health 
care decision will not transform a household with poor lines of communication 
into a paradigm of the perfect American family.&#8221;<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Major medical 
groups, including the American Medical Association, have opposed this 
interpretation of Kansas law because it intimidates teens from seeking 
reproductive health care.&nbsp; When teenagers don&#8217;t visit family planning 
providers, not only do they forego contraceptive services, they also miss or 
dangerously postpone screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, 
routine gynecological exams, and other vital health care services.&nbsp; Guarantees of confidentiality are one of the prime factors influencing whether a 
teenager will seek vital health services.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Today&#8217;s case is <EM>Aid For 
Women v. Foulston</EM>.&nbsp; Lawyers on the friend-of-the-court brief include Amiri 
and Jennifer Dalven of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.<!-- #EndEditable -->
