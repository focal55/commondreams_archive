<p>  WASHINGTON, DC - October 5 – Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) called on the Bush Administration to come clean to the American people and stop condoning the use of torture.
<P></P>
“This government does not torture people,” President Bush claimed this morning in a brief news conference. “You know, we…stick to U.S. law and our international obligations.”
<P></P>
Yesterday, The New York Times reported that despite the Justice Department’s 2004 public legal opinion that torture was “abhorrent,” only a year later the Justice Department under then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales issued a secret opinion that permitted the “harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the CIA.”
<P></P>
“The Justice Department tried pulling a cloak over Americans’ eyes by declaring torture ‘abhorrent’ in a public declaration, and then secretly permitting it,” Kucinich said.
<P></P>
“How can the President say ‘we do not torture,’ when at the same time he is condoning it?” Kucinich asked. “This type of deception and brutality is costing America our moral standing and our friendships all over the world.
<P></P>
“President Bush needs to come clean to the American people. Torture is not an American value. Congress needs to confront the President over the Administration’s repulsive use of torture and end this abhorrent technique once and for all.”
