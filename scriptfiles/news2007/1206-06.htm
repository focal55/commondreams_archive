<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 6 - Following yesterday's shooting at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, the Violence Policy Center (www.vpc.org) today released a backgrounder on SKS assault rifles:

 <P></P>

SKS Assault Rifles—A Menace to Public Safety:
 <a href="http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/SKSfactsheet.pdf" target="_new">http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/SKSfactsheet.pdf</a> 
 <P></P>
The backgrounder notes that SKS assault rifles are “the rifle model most frequently encountered by law enforcement officers,” according to a 2002 report by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).  The ATF report also notes that “these high capacity rifles pose an enhanced threat to law enforcement, in part because of their ability to expel projectiles at velocities that are capable of penetrating the type of soft body armor typically worn by the law enforcement officers.”  Despite the hazard this assault weapon poses to law enforcement and the general public, the rifle was not covered by the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.

The backgrounder also notes that Russian SKS assault rifles may not be imported pursuant to voluntary trade agreements initiated during the Clinton Administration.  The Bush Administration, however, has specifically authorized the import of SKS rifles manufactured in Albania and the former Yugoslavia.<!-- #EndEditable -->
