<p>WASHINGTON - November 13 - <em>Today, the President vetoed a funding bill that would have provided $30 billion to our nation’s leading medical research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&nbsp;The bill would have also provided about $6.3 billion to our nation’s leading public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These funds would have been used to develop life-saving medical interventions and prevent the spread of disease in the U.S. and throughout the world. </em></p>
<p><em>The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA, about the President’s veto:</em></p>

<p>“The President’s veto is tragic because it delays badly needed medical progress. Research is the only way to expand the medical arsenal against the world’s leading killers, including cancer, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Funding for research at NIH and CDC is absolutely crucial to moving forward in the fight against these and numerous other diseases. Delays in funding for the NIH and CDC hinder their ability to pursue medical progress.</p>
<p>“The veto is also unfortunate because delays in getting vital funds to the CDC put the U.S. and global health infrastructure at risk. A strong public health infrastructure is vitally important to protecting Americans and people around the world from preventable diseases.</p>
<p>“We urge the President to recognize the urgent need for this funding and sign the NIH and CDC funding bill the next time it reaches his desk.”</p>
<p><em>Families USA, with the financial support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has added global health to its list of important advocacy issues. It will focus its efforts on funding priorities for the U.S. agencies most involved in global health research and development: the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control. Families USA will also be highlighting global health issues and the reason these issues should matter to the average American.</em></p><p font-size="10pt" align="left"><em>Families USA is the national organization for health care consumers. It is nonprofit and nonpartisan and advocates for high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans.</em></p>
