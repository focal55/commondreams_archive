<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 8 - The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office:</p>
<p>"This past weekend, Congress 
capitulated to the Bush administration and gave it the authority to conduct 
warrantless dragnets of American's international phone calls and emails. And did the administration thank 
Congress? No. It called for more 
authority and for a hand out to the telecommunications companies that turned 
over our records and calls in the absence of a warrant, which they knew was 
required.</p>
<p>"Just whom did Congress 
give this unfettered power to? The 
woes of the Alberto Gonzales Justice Department are well known, but the National 
Security Agency is no better. Last 
May, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> reported that an internal management review at the NSA 
found the agency 'lacks vision and is unable to set objectives and meet them,' 
and just last week Newsweek reported the NSA so poorly managed it can't even 
keep the lights on.</p>

<p>"Where will Congress go from here? More unfettered power 
for an administration that has no respect for the privacy of the citizenry that 
elected it? A get out of jail free 
card for the companies that facilitated wiretapping, that until Sunday, was a 
crime?</p>
<p>"Congress was meant to be 
an independent branch of government. 
Democratic leaders should step up and assert their prerogative to get to 
the bottom of what the administration has been doing with our private 
information for the past six years. Congress has still not received basic 
answers about how intelligence on American soil works or how many of us have had 
our rights violated. Congress must 
also rein in the unconstitutional authority it granted the administration this 
past weekend. Democrats were 
elected to stop a president who is out of control – not grease the wheels for 
further abuse. Hopefully it won't 
take the full six months to pass legislation that will protect American 
communications. With any luck, 
congressional leadership will grow a spine before then."
