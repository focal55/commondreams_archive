<p>WASHINGTON - November 16 -  Amnesty International USA's executive director Larry Cox issued the following comments after his meeting today with Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, to press for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency, the reinstatement of the judiciary in Pakistan and permission for United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights Louise Arbour to visit the country:
<P></P>
"I appreciate Ambassador Durrani's willingness to discuss the current crisis in Pakistan and hear Amnesty International's deep concerns about the suspension of the judiciary, detention of activists, lawyers and journalists and suppression of public demonstrations. The Ambassador expressed similar concerns about the human rights situation in his country. Yet he also noted that the people being arrested are breaking the law by publicly assembling to demonstrate their opposition to the current actions of General Pervez Musharraf."
<P></P>
"Amnesty International is pleased that Ambassador Durrani agreed with our recommendation to allow U.N. High Commissioner Louise Arbour to visit Pakistan, and that he would strongly advise his government to permit such a visit."
<P></P>
"While General Musharraf continues to disregard basic rights of Pakistani citizens, the Ambassador's assurances point to a small step in the right direction." <!-- #EndEditable -->
