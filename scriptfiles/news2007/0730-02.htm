<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 30 - On June 24, the
Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations concluded its annual
General Assembly in Portland, OR with passage of a statement calling for
repeal of the U.S. Military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" ban on lesbian, gay
and bisexual service members. The Action of Immediate Witness, which calls
for passage of the Military Readiness Enhancement Act (H.R. 1246), a
Congressional bill to repeal the law, was overwhelmingly supported by the
6000 attendees at the conference.
    <P></P>"People of compassionate faith understand the importance of ending
discrimination in our Armed Forces," said Captain Joan Darrah, USN (Ret.),
a member of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network's (SLDN) Advisory Board,
who was instrumental in the resolution's passage. "SLDN salutes the
Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations for their tireless
efforts in building grassroots momentum for repeal. Our nation must treat
all service members with dignity and respect, but 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'
denies that honor to our lesbian, gay and bisexual personnel."
    <P></P> "I am proud that the Unitarian Universalists have taken a strong stand
in support of lesbian gay bisexual and transgendered patriots," said
Unitarian minister, SLDN Advisory Board member and Master Chief Petty
Officer of the Coast Guard (Ret.) Vincent Patton. "The action of the
General Assembly puts the Unitarian Universalist Association at the
forefront of the national effort to improve our nation's security by
embracing America's best and brightest, including lesbian gay bisexual and
transgendered Americans who have answered our nation's call to duty."
     <P></P>The Unitarian Universalist Association consists of over 1,010
congregations in the United States, with over 220,000 members, and is
served by more than 1,100 ministers. The statement by the General Assembly
calls upon its individual members to pledge themselves to work for repeal
of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." For more information on the UUA, visit

    <P></P> Servicemembers Legal Defense Network is a national, non-profit legal
services, watchdog and policy organization dedicated to ending
discrimination against and harassment of military personnel affected by
'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' and related forms of intolerance. For more
