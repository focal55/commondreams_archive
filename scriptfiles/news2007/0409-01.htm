<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Washington, DC — The Florida manatee will lose its
protections as a federal endangered species under a new plan being
prepared by the Bush administration, according to an internal document
released today by the Save the Manatee Club and Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility (PEER).</p>
<p>According to a March 26, 2007 briefing paper from the U.S. Fish
&amp; Wildlife Service (FWS) labeled “White House Report,” the FWS is
preparing a recommendation to downgrade or “down-list” the manatee from
its present “endangered” status to “threatened” under the Federal
Endangered Species Act. This change will reduce protections against the
“taking” of manatees and facilitate construction of more marinas and
other development in critical coastal habitat areas.</p>
<p>“A federal reclassification at this time could undermine our chances
of securing the manatee’s future in the face of exploding human
population growth and shrinking aquatic habitat in Florida,” stated
Patrick Rose, an aquatic biologist who is Save the Manatee Club’s
executive director. “With the price of coastal land skyrocketing,
regulations protecting manatees are seen as standing in the way of even
more extensive development of Florida’s coastline.”</p>
<p>Todd Willens, a newly appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, is shepherding the 5-year
status review and listing downgrade for the manatee. Prior to his
appointment, Willens was policy director for former U.S. Representative
Richard Pombo, who unsuccessfully sought legislative changes to weaken
the Endangered Species Act and was defeated in the 2006 election.</p>
<p>“As we enter the lame duck stretch of the Bush administration, there will be more of these efforts to<br>
circumvent Congress by using the administrative process to undermine
the laws they cannot repeal,” added PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch,
pointing to recently exposed Bush administration plans to weaken the
Endangered Species Act by a series of regulations. “This is another
case of the scientists being run over by the combined political weight
of the Florida homebuilder, marina and recreational boating lobbies.”</p>
<p>The 417 manatee deaths recorded in 2006 was an all-time high
fatality total, following a near-record fatality year in 2005.
Conservationists are concerned that the federal reclassification will
aggravate the principal threats to manatee survival at a very unstable
period, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boating Deaths. The legal basis for boat speed
restrictions, already unevenly enforced, will be weakened by the new
Bush plan. Speedboat collisions and propeller maiming are already the
major cause for manatee deaths;</li>
  <li>Water Pollution, Algal
Blooms and Red Tides. A new ongoing outbreak of red tide may have
already claimed the lives of scores of manatees in Southwest Florida
where researchers agree the sub-population is declining. This new
threat source will be aggravated by human population growth; and</li>
  <li>Habitat
Loss through Development. The destruction of the manatee’s aquatic
habitat to make way for new coastal development is even now proceeding
at break-neck speed. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the manatee population could experience large die-offs
as aging power plants go off-line. Power plant outfalls that serve as
warm water refuges would no longer be available, leading to the
possible loss of hundreds of wintering manatees to cold stress
syndrome. Moreover, many of the Florida springs that manatees depend
upon are declining in flow. Removal of the manatee’s endangered status
would likely undermine efforts to find alternative warm water sources.</p>
<p>Despite all of these looming threats, which the Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has determined could result in
the loss of 50% of the manatee population in the next 45 years, FWC is
also poised to downgrade the protected status of the manatee under
state law. If the federal government follows suit, many feel that the
remaining safety net for the manatee will have been severed.</p>
<p>“This reclassification comes at the worst possible time for the
manatee when record numbers are dying and threats to their long-term
survival are increasing,” Rose concluded. “This move to down list
manatees is politically driven, is not legally defensible, and is
certainly not motivated by concern for the survival of the manatee.”</p>
