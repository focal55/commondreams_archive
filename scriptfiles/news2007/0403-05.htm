<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Tucson, AZ - Franciscan Fr. Louie Vitale and Jesuit Fr. Steve Kelly will be arraigned today at 8:30 a.m. at the U.S. District Court, 6th floor, 405 W. Congress St., Tucson, Arizona, on a federal charge of trespass. Supporters will join with the two men in front of the courthouse at 7:45 a.m. for readings and prayer before the arraignment.

<P></P>Military prosecutors have told advisory counsel to the two priests that the government will ask the judge to jail the men pending trial, citing the defendants' extensive history of arrests, press accounts, and the likelihood that they will not stop protesting or risking jail for protests while awaiting trial.

<P></P>The two men were arrested last November 19, 2006 at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Arizona. The priests sought entry to speak with enlisted personnel and deliver a letter denouncing torture and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to Major General Barbara Fast, commander at the post. They were part of a group of 120 people taking part in a demonstration to protest that day against military intelligence training at the Fort that fosters torture.  The men were issued citations for trespass (USC 18-1382) and released.

<P></P>In February, Frs. Kelly and Vitale returned to Arizona where they were told they would be arraigned on the federal charge. Instead, a procedural hearing at Fort Huachuca resulted only in an add charge of “Failure to Comply with a Police Officer” (ARS 28-622). If found guilty of both  state and federal charges, Kelly and Vitale face a maximum sentence of ten months in prison.

<P></P>The November demonstration took place in solidarity with the annual vigil at Fort Benning, Georgia, where over 20,000 people demanded that the infamous School of the Americas (now called the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation) be shut down.  Fifteen people arrested at Fort Benning are now serving or will soon be reporting to serve prison sentences ranging from one to six months.
