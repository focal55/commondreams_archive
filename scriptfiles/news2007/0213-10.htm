<p>WASHINGTON - February 13 - Global warming is the greatest and most 
urgent environmental challenge of our time.&nbsp; Governor Corzine rose to the 
challenge today by establishing a firm, far-reaching, science-based commitment 
to reduce New Jersey&rsquo;s global warming emissions.&nbsp; Further, his support for 
policies needed to achieve steep reductions will ensure New Jersey tackles this 
problem head-on and sets a vital precedent for strong national action.&nbsp; 
<p class="MsoNormal">Governor Corzine&rsquo;s support of the New 
Jersey Global Warming Response Act, requiring mandatory caps on all global 
warming emissions from all sources statewide, is especially important.&nbsp; With 
leadership from the Governor and key environmental leaders in the New Jersey 
legislature, New Jersey is poised to become the second state in the nation to 
pass this ground-breaking legislation, the first comprehensive solution to 
global warming advanced in our nation.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is also critical to ensure New Jersey&rsquo;s 
commitment to tackling this problem is not superseded by imported electricity 
generated by coal-fired power plants in nearby states.&nbsp; One major threat is 
across the Delaware in Pennsylvania, where TXU Energy has proposed building two 
to three conventional coal-fired power plants.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these plants are 
constructed, they will wipe out all of the global warming emissions reductions 
in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.&nbsp; Another threat is American Electric 
Power&rsquo;s proposed $3 billion 765-kv transmission line that would pump in dirty 
energy from West Virginia to New Jersey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, Governor Corzine has tools at 
his disposal to address this problem.&nbsp; One such tool, which we strongly favor, 
is to work with the state legislature to require a global warming emissions 
standard for all electricity imported to New Jersey.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We also look forward to working with the 
Governor and the Legislature to begin implementing these goals with&nbsp;initial 
measurable, meaningful steps, such as more&nbsp;energy efficient building&nbsp;codes and 
appliance&nbsp;standards, opposition to new in-state coal plants, construction of an 
offshore wind pilot project and maintaining a strong clean energy fund,&nbsp;this 
year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">New Jerseyans know that global warming is 
real.&nbsp; It will pack a mean punch, especially for our children and future 
generations, if we don't act quickly to aggressively curb our emissions. The 
Governor&rsquo;s announcement today puts New Jersey at the forefront of the national 
debate about what must be done to reverse global warming. 
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If we&rsquo;re going to solve global warming, we 
have to start here and now.&nbsp; </p>
