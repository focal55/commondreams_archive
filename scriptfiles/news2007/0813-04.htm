<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 13 -U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Patrick 
          Leahy (D-VT) are pushing for needed reforms to improve the No Child 
          Left Behind (NCLB) education law. The Senators have written to the Senate 
          Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee outlining some 
          of their priorities for the reauthorization of NCLB. While Feingold 
          and Leahy support strong accountability measures for our nation’s 
          schools, they called NCLB’s one-size-fits-all policies the wrong 
          approach. Instead, Feingold and Leahy called for changes to be made 
          to the federal testing mandates to ensure local control over decisions 
          affecting our children’s day-to-day classroom experiences, including 
          the frequency and use of standardized tests. Feingold and Leahy are 
          pushing for changes to reaffirm that states, local districts, and educators 
          are the leaders in school reform and accountability efforts and the 
          role of the federal government is to support innovative state and local 
          school reform efforts.</p>
        <p>“NCLB has hamstrung state and local decision-making by establishing 
          a federal system that measures and punishes our students and our schools 
          based on, among other things, annual high-stakes standardized testing,” 
          Feingold said. “This is the wrong approach, and the groundswell 
          of opposition to NCLB – from parents, educators, and administrators 
          – shows just how flawed it is.”</p>

        <p>“Five years of experience with NCLB have shown that its one-size-fits-all 
          approach and unfunded mandates can do more harm than good in states 
          like Vermont,” said Leahy. “To truly raise the achievement 
          of all of Vermont’s students, we need flexibility and sensitivity 
          to the particular needs of our state and our students.”</p>
        <p>Both Feingold and Leahy were among the ten senators to vote against 
          NCLB in December of 2001. Feingold’s and Leahy’s major priorities 
          for reforming the legislation include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining local control over decisions affecting children’s 
            day-to-day classroom experiences including the frequency and use of 
            standardized testing<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Reforming the one-size-fits all adequate yearly progress model to 
            provide flexibility for states to develop alternative accountability 
            models such as growth models, which give a more complete picture of 
            annual progress in our nation’s schools<br>

          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Improving the Department of Education’s peer review process 
            by requiring the Secretary to ensure decisions made by peer review 
            teams among the various states are consistent<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Encouraging states to use multiple forms of assessment by providing 
            more resources for states and local districts to develop innovative 
            assessments that measure higher-order thinking skills<br>
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>Providing additional resources to help states build technical capacity 
            in order to comply with existing federal accountability requirements<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Creating a volunteer teacher advisory committee to provide Congress 
            and the Department of Education feedback on NCLB’s impact in 
            the classroom<br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Providing more flexibility for schools to address their unique school 
            improvement needs<br>

          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Reexamining the feasibility of the 2014 deadline for 100% proficiency 
            and putting in place a trigger that waives the 2014 deadline as long 
            as federal Title I funding does not meet authorized levels</li>
        </ul>
