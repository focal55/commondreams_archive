<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 - Green Party leaders called impeachment an urgent necessity after former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan's revelation that President Bush and Vice President Cheney were involved in the conspiracy to expose the identity of CIA undercover operative Valerie Plame.
<P></P>
"Evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors from the White House are staring us in the face.  What will it take for the Democratic Party to move on impeachment?  By refusing to impeach, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer [D-Md.], Rep. Nancy Pelosi [D-Calif.], Sen. Harry Reid [D-Nev.], and other Democratic leaders are aiding and abetting crimes committed by President Bush and Vice President Cheney," said Peter Thottam, Green Party member, attorney, and Executive Director of the Los Angeles National Impeachment Center .
<P></P>
Greens called it absolutely imperative that US Department of Justice Special Counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald investigate Mr. McClellan's assertions about the role of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney in an illegal attempt to discredit Ambassador Joseph Wilson after Mr. Wilson revealed that the President's 2003 State of the Union claim about an Iraqi nuclear weapons material deal was based on a known forgery.
<P></P>
The Green Party of the United States called for impeachment in July 2003 after President Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, which Greens called an act of military aggression outlawed under the US Constitutional and international law, and lied to the American people about the reasons for the invasion.
<P></P>
Since 2003, White House crimes have continued to mount: detention without trial, surveillance of US citizens without warrant, approval for torture, "signing statements" purportedly allowing the President to disregard laws passed by Congress, violation of international laws and treaties signed by the US, inaction and racist response to environmental emergencies (Hurricanes Katrina and Rita), endangering public health by tampering with scientific research on global warming.
<P></P>
Greens supported former Rep. Cynthia McKinney's (D-Ga.) impeachment motion in December 2006  and have praised Rep. Dennis Kucinich's (D-Ohio) recent introduction of an impeachment resolution, which was tabled by House Democratic leaders.
<P></P>
In recent months, several Green Party activists have protested and committed acts of civil disobedience to persuade Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and other Congress members to impeach the President and Vice President.
<P></P>
"If we had some Greens in Congress right now, we'd already be seeing impeachment and possible criminal prosecution.  Greens would not only lead on impeachment, their very presence would drive top Democrats and perhaps some Republican to support it.  It's time to replace two-party collusion with multi-party competition," said David J. Kalbfleisch, Green Party candidate for the U.S. House in Illinois (10th District)<!-- #EndEditable -->
