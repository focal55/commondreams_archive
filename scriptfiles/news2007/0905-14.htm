<p>NEW YORK - September 5 - As thousands gather to attend the 26th annual Farm Aid concert to benefit America's family farmer -- to be held this Sunday on NYC's Randall's Island -- a group of farmers and veterans are meeting to call attention to an issue receiving little attention in today's headlines: the burden on rural communities after six years of war.  A recent Carsey Institute Report  indicates that small towns and rural areas across the country bear drastically disproportionate numbers of fatalities in both Iraq and Afghanistan. 

 
<P></P>
Global war, global warming, and the excessive use of fossil fuels are adding to the already existing crises of loss of farmland, family farmers and economic opportunity in rural America.  Now hundreds of thousands of young men and women are returning from war to these very communities without adequate healthcare, counseling or vocational training.

 <P></P>

The public forum on "The War and Rural America" will focus on changing our nation's priorities from war and destruction to support for family farmers, regional agriculture, bio-fuels, and job opportunities on farms for returning veterans.

   <P></P>                    

   <strong>WHAT:</strong>           "The War and Rural America" hosted by Farms Not Arms and Family Farm Defenders
