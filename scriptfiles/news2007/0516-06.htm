<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 - As the U.S. Senate
debates the future of immigration policy, real families caught in the teeth
of America's broken immigration system will come to Capitol Hill to testify
before national leaders.
    <P></P>Since January 2007, the Bush Administration has executed at least 85
raids on immigrant communities, arresting over 3,000 workers and stranding
children of those workers in every city they hit. Advocates are calling for
a moratorium on these anti-family raids and Congressional leaders have
promised to take action. These families and community leaders will provide
a first-hand account of the desperate need for Congress to deliver humane
immigration reform this year. National leaders will respond to their heart
wrenching testimony.
    <P></P>Following the hearing, the Fair Immigration Reform Movement will
release a report on the local impact of the Bush Administration's
anti-family immigration raid policy.

           5 Parents Caught in Immigration Raids and Their Children

    <P></P>Parents Testifying include:

   <P></P> -- Sandra is the mother of a 15-month-old baby girl. She was separated
       from her daughter during a raid on March 6th at the Michael Bianco
       factory in New Bedford, MA. Sandra struggled through 10 days apart from
       her daughter in a jail in El Paso, Texas. When she was brought to
       Texas, she had no idea when or if she would see her daughter again.
       Sandra is originally from Cape Verde and her brother, who took care of
       her daughter during their separation, recently became a citizen.

  <P></P>  -- Norma is United States citizen. On September 20, 2006, the day of her
       fourth wedding anniversary, her husband was arrested and detained by
       I.C.E. agents in Richmond, California.  At the time she was seven month
       pregnant and her husband was the sole provider for Norma, their two-
       year old daughter, and their unborn child.  For two weeks Norma could
       not determine the whereabouts of her husband.  Her daughter would cry
       and ask "When is Papi coming home?"  Her husband was eventually
       released. Their petition as husband and wife has been submitted to
       immigration authorities, but they still have no guarantee that he will
       not be deported.

  <P></P>  -- Lixiere, Originally from El Salvador, Lixiere and his family came to
       the US escaping poverty and violence. His son, 2 and 1/2 years old was
       separated from both his parents, as Lixiere and his wife were both
       detained during the New Bedford raid.  Lixiere and his wife spent eight
       days in jail, while their son suffered extreme trauma from the
       separation. The son was taken care of by Lixiere's brother in law, who
       tried his best to get the toddler to eat as he resisted and lost
       weight. Lixiere was without any notice of where his son was for
       24 hours.

  <P></P>  -- Maria is the mother of two children and lives in Palatine, Illinois.
       On February 17, 2007 at Cano Packing, a sweets packing factory, Maria
       was among 17 people that were arrested and detained in an I.C.E. raid.
       On the same day Cynthia, Maria's daughter, waited anxiously for her
       mother to come home from work so they could celebrate her birthday with
       her mom.  Her mother didn't return that day and now faces deportation.

  <P></P>  -- Dominga is the mother of 3 children, 2 years old, 5 years old and
       7 years old. Her husband, Hector Mendez, was detained during the New
       Bedford raid. Since then, she has struggled to make ends meet for her
       children, as Hector was the bread winner of the family. Originally from
       Guatemala, the family came to the US looking for a better life. While
       Hector was only making $7.00/an hour at the factory, the little he
       earned could provide for his young family. Dominga feels alone and
       depressed as she faces the reality of raising her children alone.
