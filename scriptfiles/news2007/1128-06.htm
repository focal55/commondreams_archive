<p>LONDON - November 28 -Over 150 Members of Parliament were contacted today in the call for justice for the Palestinians. Over 500 people came to make their point to their representatives. The aim of the lobby is to change British Government policy, so that the British Government takes every possible step to implement international law in support of Palestinian rights.

 <P></P>

The Annapolis declaration stating that talks about final status issues will take place within one year rings hollow to the Palestinian people after the experience of the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap. 
 <P></P>
George Bush, Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas all called for peace, meanwhile the assault on Gaza’s 1.5 million people continues.   The siege is creating a humanitarian disaster, with the destruction of the economy, and the collapse of health and education services. 
 <P></P>
Betty Hunter, General Secretary of Palestine Solidarity Campaign commented, “Before the Palestinians can start to feel hopeful that there will be an end to occupation they need to see new ‘facts on the ground’ starting with the immediate dismantling of the checkpoints and the apartheid wall, followed by the disbandment of all settlements.  The British people are increasingly demanding that our government supports the Palestinian people’s rights under international law.”

  <P></P>

The exclusion from Annapolis of Hamas, which won the democratic elections in 2006, means that the Palestinians were not fully represented.  Instead of promoting Palestinian unity, this negotiation process will only further undermine it.

  <P></P>

The Palestine Solidarity Campaign will be joining today’s lobby of parliament called to mark the UN day of solidarity with the Palestinian people is being attended by hundreds of people from all over Britain and all walks of life.  It will call for our government:

  <P></P>
<ul>
    <li>To end the economic and political isolation of Gaza
    <li>To insist that Israel complies with international law and ends its continuing expansion of settlements on occupied Palestinian land
    <li>To respect the International Court of Justice advisory opinion regarding the illegal wall in the West Bank and Jerusalem and hold Israel to account
    <li>To recognise those elected democratically by the Palestinian people and help to reconcile the differences between Fatah and Hamas
</ul> <P></P>
 

Our government must play its role in ensuring the Palestinians’ rights are realised, if we are to have any hope that the new round of talks launched at Annapolis will achieve a lasting peace.<!-- #EndEditable -->
