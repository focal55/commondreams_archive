<p>LONDON - November 28 -There will be a mass climate demonstration in London1 on Saturday, December 8th, part of a global protest with demonstrations and events in more than 50 countries around the world 2. The worldwide protests will coincide with the UN Climate talks in Bali and demand urgent action from world leaders to prevent the catastrophic destabilisation of global climate

The London demonstrators will march to the US embassy to protest against the Bush administration continuing to block progress at the crucial international Climate Talks. However the march will start near the House of Commons where demonstrators will demand a strong and effective Climate Bill from the UK government.

Phil Thornhill from the Campaign against Climate Change said   “As the Arctic shrinks before our eyes and warnings from the scientists reach a deafening crescendo still world leaders fail to take any effective action to head off looming catastrophe. As Greece and California burn, as Bangladeshis drown and Britain floods, alarm and anger around the world are beginning to mount, above all against the Bush administration in the USA, the calculating obstructionism of which now stands out ever more clearly as a crime against humanity, with the potential to be more fatefully destructive in its impact than all the great genocides of the past century put together.  And the realisation dawns here in the UK, that we need a government that can show real leadership and mobilise the whole of society to face this crisis, not one that tells us to boil less water in our kettles whilst it continues to build more roads, runways and coal-fired power stations.”

Notes:

  <P></P>

1/ Last year on November 4th, during the Nairobi climate Talks, 25 to 30 thousand people gathered in Trafalgar Square to demand effective action on climate change. On December 3rd 2005 during the Montreal Climate Talks 10,000 marched in London. This year’s London protest is matched by demonstrations in Glasgow, Belfast and Dublin.

This year already more than a 100,000 have joined rallies for the Step it Up campaign calling for action on climate in the USA and 120,000 “Walked against Warming” in Australia on November 11th.
