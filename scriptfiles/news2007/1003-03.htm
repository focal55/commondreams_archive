<p>  WASHINGTON - October 3 – A coalition of environmental
advocates filed a petition today with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), asking the agency to set pollution rules for large,
ocean-going marine vessels. These vessels include cargo and cruise
ships. Earthjustice, the leading U.S. public interest environmental law
firm, filed this first ever petition on behalf of Oceana, Friends of the
Earth and the Center for Biological Diversity.
<p></p>
California Attorney General Edmund G. "Jerry" Brown, Jr. also filed a
petition to U.S. EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson on behalf of the
state of California today, with a similar request.
<p></p>
The petitions would require the EPA to assess ships' contributions to
global warming, seek public comment and issue rules to reduce this
pollution or explain why it will not act.
<p></p>
The April 2007 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court clearly established
that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA authority to address global
warming. The EPA must act immediately and issue regulations to limit
pollution that contributes to global warming. The petitions filed today
begin the process of imposing mandatory regulations on the marine
transportation sector. The petitioners asked the EPA to respond within
180 days.
<p></p>
The Climate Change Problem
<p></p>
The science is unequivocal. Global climate change is real, occurring at
an alarming rate with catastrophic consequences, and is caused primarily
by human activity. Ships are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
The global fleet of marine vessels releases almost three percent of the
world's carbon dioxide, an amount comparable to the emissions of Canada.
Because of their huge number and inefficient operating practices, marine
vessels release a large volume of global warming pollutants,
particularly carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and black carbon (or soot).
<p></p>
Despite their impact on the global climate, greenhouse gas emissions
from ships are not currently regulated by the United States government.
In addition, these emissions are not limited under the Kyoto Protocol or
other international treaties that address global warming.
<p></p>
Ships' Contribution to the Climate Change Problem
<p></p>
Global shipping activity has increased by three percent per year for the
last three decades and this rate of growth is projected to increase. If
fuel use remains unchanged, shipping pollution will increase
substantially, potentially doubling from 2002 levels by 2020 and
tripling by 2030..
<p></p>
"Global warming pollution from ships is a substantial problem. But
fortunately, it's one that can be solved," said Danielle Fugere of
Friends of the Earth. "Slower speeds, cleaner fuels, better ships - the
steps that the shipping industry must take are clear. It's up to the EPA
to ensure these steps are taken."
<p></p>
Why We Should Care
<p></p>
Climate change is already causing widespread melting of Arctic glaciers
and sea ice, shortening the snow season and raising global temperatures.
<p></p>

The resulting sea level rise could eliminate up to 22 percent of the
worlds coastal wetlands and as much as 43 percent of U.S. wetlands.
Wetlands provide habitat, protect against floods and storm surges and
contribute to local economies.
<p></p>
Our oceans and freshwater environments, including organisms at the
bottom of the aquatic food chain, are already under stress from climate
change.  Ranges of algae, plankton and fish have shifted in response to
changes in water temperature, ice cover, oxygen content, salinity and
circulation. If they die off, entire aquatic ecosystems will follow.
<p></p>
Among the species that are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing
habitats are cold-water fish, such as salmon and cod, polar bears,
walruses, seals, whales, caribou, reindeer, corals, turtles and
countless species of migrating sea birds.
<p></p>
"If we're going to slow the Arctic melt-down and save Arctic species, we
must control global warming pollution from ships," said Kassie Siegel,
Climate Program Director for the Center for Biological Diversity.
"Implementing the solutions in the petition is the first step toward
slowing warming and protecting these species' future."
<p></p>
Human health is also impacted by climate change caused by global warming
pollution. Climate-related illnesses include air-quality related heart
and lung disease, heat-stroke, malnutrition, and casualties from fires,
storms and floods.
<p></p>
"Climate change is threatening ocean life from the Arctic to the
tropics. Shipping pollution has been given a free pass so far and it's
way past time to fix that," said Dr. Michael Hirshfield, Oceana's Senior
Vice President for North America and Chief Scientist.
<p></p>
Potential Solutions
<p></p>
The coalition's petition asks the Environmental Protection Agency to:
<p></p>
*       Require marine vessels to increase their fuel efficiency,
thereby reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants<br>
*       Require marine vessels to use cleaner fuels to reduce greenhouse
gas and soot emissions<br>
*       Extend these new regulations to all marine cargo vessels
operating in U.S. waters, whether they are registered in the United
States or another country, to avoid disproportionate burdens on U.S.
ships and to reduce pollution emitted in U.S. waters
<p></p>
"Halting and reversing global warming will require innovation across
every sector of the global economy," said Tim Ballo, attorney for
Earthjustice. "Today, we are asking the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to begin regulating global warming pollution in earnest. The time
for voluntary measures has passed."
