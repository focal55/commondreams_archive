<p>LOS ANGELES - January 18 - Robert Greenwald and Brave New Foundation announced today they are creating a living online memorial to U.S. soldiers killed during the Iraq war. The Iraq Veterans Memorial will bear witness with the 60-second video testimonies of family, friends, co-workers, and military colleagues of those killed. The people powered memorial will be unveiled on March 19th, 2007, the fourth anniversary of the war, at iraqmemorial.org and on blogs and websites around the world. The memorial will be available for free to all and will pay witness to the soldiers who have been killed in Iraq. 

<p>Inspired by the AIDS Quilt, the Vietnam memorial, and the New York Times biographies of the 9/11 victims, Brave New Foundation is working with Gold Star Families Speak Out, Soldiers of Today and Yesterday, GI Special, Military Families Speak Out, Iraq Veterans Against the War, North Texas Vets, Veterans for Peace, and United for Peace and Justice to honor the memory of those killed in Iraq.

<p>"I want my son to be remembered, that he lived and not how he died. This project will let people know about Ken and all the others" said Karen Meredith, Executive Director of Gold Star Families Speak Out. Over the next two months Brave New Foundation will collect individual video testimonies, from which a living memorial will be created.

<p>"For my most recent film Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers, I interviewed several young men and women who served in Iraq. Their stories and their strength moved me profoundly. I wanted to help create something for them and people like them. A way to recognize who soldiers are and what their death means to those close to them. While I personally oppose the war, this is about the human toll." said Director Robert Greenwald. The memorial will emphasize the individual lives lost, while serving as a living site for people around the world to remember loved ones.

<p>Details on the memorial, how to participate, and how to host the memorial can be found at iraqmemorial.org. Brave New Foundation will be taping testimonials in Washington DC on January 27th and 28th, in conjunction with the UFPJ march on Washington.
