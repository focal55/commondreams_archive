<p>  WASHINGTON - October 5 –The Environmental Working Group (EWG) issued the following
statement today in response to media outlets that reported on a fish
industry study urging pregnant women to disregard FDA guidance on fish
consumption.
<P></P>
"Press reports in the Washington Post, Reuters, ABC, and countless other
outlets read like a fish industry press release. The lack of critical
reporting and fact checking on this report is staggering," said Richard
Wiles, Executive Director of EWG. "You would think that when a study
recommends throwing out official FDA health guidelines for pregnant women
that the media might check the sources of the information," Wiles added.
<P></P>
It turns out that the committee's travel and website costs to the tune of
$74 thousand were paid for by the fish industry, and that the vice chairman
of the coalition that produced the "study" works for the K Street lobbying
and PR operation, Burson Marsteller.
<P></P>
The authors claimed, and the press dutifully reported that major public
health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, support the
study's claim that pregnant women need not worry about exposing their babies
to mercury by eating fish. Basic fact checking by EWG revealed that the
Academy is not even a member of the coalition that produced the report.
<P></P>
The underlying goal of the seafood industry is to perpetuate the myth that
there is a debate about the risks of mercury in fish. The media has fallen
for it hook, line and sinker.
<P></P>
There is in fact no debate. The FDA advice is clear. Pregnant women, and
women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should eat no more than 12
ounces of fish per week, no more than 6 ounces of albacore tuna, and no
shark, tuna, mackerel, or swordfish at all. In stark contrast, this study
actually recommends unlimited consumption of two fish on FDA's do not eat
list, and still most of the media did not bother to check whether the FDA,
CDC or the American Academy of Pediatrics had any concerns with the
findings.
<P></P>
"Under these standards for reporting, cigarettes don't cause cancer," said
Wiles.
<P></P>
But what about omega's and brain development? No confusion there either.
Eat fish high in omega 3s and low in mercury, and look for other sources of
these beneficial nutrients.
<P></P>
"This report is much more than factually wrong, it's downright dangerous. If
mothers-to-be actually followed this advice there would be an epidemic of
mercury-damaged children in this country," said Wiles. "We need to reduce
mercury consumption, not increase it."
<P></P>
According to mercury experts at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
more than 1 in 6 children born in the United States are at risk for
developmental disorders due to levels of mercury currently in maternal blood
at current low levels of fish consumption. Increasing fish consumption in
the manner recommended by the study would make matters much worse. Mercury
often concentrates in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women, exposing
their babies to this dangerous chemical.
