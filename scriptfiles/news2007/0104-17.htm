<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 - Members of Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), the largest organization of military families speaking out against a war in the history of the U.S., will be delivering letters and photos to the incoming members of the 110th Congress as they take office on Thursday, January 4th with a single message: Support Our Troops – De-Fund The War. Military families will be specifically asking Congress to de-fund the war by voting against the upcoming appropriation bill that is expected to be considered in February or March. The letter that will be delivered to Senators and Members of Congress expresses the urgency of ending the war: “Each day that the war in Iraq continues, on average, three or more U.S. troops and countless Iraqi children, women and men are killed.”  

 

<p>MFSO members with loved ones who are serving, have served, will be deployed or re-deployed or have been killed in Iraq have traveled from as far away as Washington state, Ohio, and Kentucky; and will be joined by military families from Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, and Washington D.C. As they visit the offices of incoming and returning Congressional Representatives and Senators they will be carrying the voices of over 3,100 military families in saying: “We are calling on you to vote against the upcoming appropriation for continuing the U.S. military occupation of Iraq. As military families we will stand with all who support our troops by voting to de-fund this unjust and unjustifiable military misadventure.”  But they will also be saying to those in Congress who say they oppose the war but continue to vote in favor of funding it: “You cannot simultaneously oppose and fund this war…You fund it, and you’ve bought it. The war in Iraq will no longer be President Bush’s war. It will be yours.”
