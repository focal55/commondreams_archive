WASHINGTON - September 10 - The American Civil Liberties Union today condemned reports 
that telecommunications companies datamined their customers' records at the 
request of the FBI. The requests, first reported by the New York Times, 
asked phone companies to identify the "communities of interest" of customers 
being scrutinized by the FBI and were brought to light in documents obtained by 
a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation. The FBI has since ceased the demands. </p>
<p>"For years, the FBI was not only asking telecom companies to do its 
investigative work, but also asking them to sidestep the Fourth Amendment," said 
Michael German, ACLU National Security Policy Counsel. "The fact that telecoms 
complied with the FBI’s intrusive demands is shocking. It sets an extremely 
risky precedent to hand out such broad and vague authority to telecom companies. 
Ceding investigative powers to private companies will have disastrous effects 
not only for Americans’ privacy, but for their safety." </p>

<p>These revelations come at a time when broad telecom amnesty is being debated 
on Capitol Hill for the companies’ role in the National Security Agency’s 
domestic spying program. The ACLU noted that this is not the first time these 
companies have asked for immunity from criminal prosecution. There has been a 
sustained below the radar lobby effort to get amnesty since the administration’s 
surveillance program was revealed at the end of 2005. The first concerted effort 
was made through a lobbying push at the end of the 109th Congress with a section 
of the Protecting Consumer Phone Records Act. The section would have preempted 
stronger state privacy laws and eliminated the rights of independent state 
agencies to investigate the companies’ role in warrantless spying. In April of 
this year, an immunity provision was included in the administration’s first FISA 
"modernization" proposal. Further attempts to attach immunity to other 
legislation were beaten back by privacy groups. </p>
<p>"We are increasingly discovering the intrinsic role telecom companies played 
in the administration’s unwarranted and illegal surveillance of Americans," said 
Timothy Sparapani, ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel. "Congress should not even 
begin to consider blanket amnesty before investigating just how deeply these 
companies were entrenched with the government’s spying program. This is about 
accountability. The law was clear and if telecom companies placed their bottom 
line over the constitutional rights of their customers, they need to face the 
consequences."</p>
