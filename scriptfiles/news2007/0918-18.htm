<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 18 - Representatives from the Washington and Ottawa Ethiopian Embassies will
be in Guelph today to sign a historic trademark agreement with Planet
Bean Coffee.  The agreement developed after a prolonged battle between
Ethiopia and coffee giant Starbucks over the trade mark rights to use
the names of coffees originating in Ethiopia.  Ethiopia is the
birthplace of coffee.
<P></P>
In 2005 the Ethiopian government filed applications to trademark its
most famous coffee names, Sidamo, Harar and Yirgacheffe. Securing the
rights to these names would enable Ethiopia to capture more value from
the trade, by controlling their use in the market and thereby
enabling farmers to receive a greater share of the retail price.
Starbucks attempted to squash the application.  A battle ensued between
the coffee giant and Ethiopia which was joined by
organizations led by Oxfam. Eventually Starbucks backed down.
<P></P>
"It's a little like Walmart deciding what the French in Bordeaux can put
on their wine labels," commented Bill Barrett from Planet Bean, " the
Ethiopians have been growing and drinking coffee longer than anyone on
earth, I think they should control the rights to their own coffee origins."
<P></P>
Planet Bean will be the first Canadian coffee company to sign the new
agreement with the Ethiopian government allowing the coffee roastery to
use the names.  The company is one of the first 100% certified fair
trade coffee roasters in Canada and has been purchasing coffee from
Ethiopia since 2002.
<P></P>
The signing will take place at Planet Bean, 259 Grange Road, Unit 2,
Guelph at 5 pm and include a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony.
