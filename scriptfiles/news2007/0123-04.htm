<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - Progressive Democrats of America, the grassroots 
            ally of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is mobilizing its 
            membership into the streets for this Saturday's peace march in D.C. 
            Jan. 27 and into the halls of Congress Monday Jan. 29&nbsp; to lobby 
            on behalf of a prompt, orderly withdrawal of US troops from 
Iraq.</P>
            <P>Founded in 2004, PDA's multiracial Advisory Board includes six 
            members of Congress, and legendary peace and justice activists such 
            as Tom Hayden, Cindy Sheehan, Medea Benjamin of Code Pink and Rev. 
            Lennox Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus.</P>
            <P>"Through our marching and lobbying, we are not aiming our 
            communication at the White House," commented PDA Executive Director 
            Tim Carpenter, "but at Democrats who have been complicit in 
            prolonging a futile occupation of Iraq, that most Iraqis want ended. 
            The voters spoke in November; some Democratic leaders aren't 
            listening."</P>
            <P>PDA is coordinating and rallying grassroots support nationwide 
            behind two bills: </P>
            <P>**&nbsp; H.R. 508, The Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty 
            Restoration Act, a comprehensive&nbsp; alternative to escalation 
            introduced by PDA Advisory Board members Lynn Woolsey, Barbara Lee 
            and Maxine Waters that&nbsp; would bring all US troops home within 6 
            months, while providing economic aid and a framework for stability 
            in Iraq and fully funding the VA health care system. </P>
            <P>**&nbsp; Rep. Jim McGovern's Safe and Orderly Withdrawal Act, to 
            be reintroduced this week, which would use appropriated funds for an 
            orderly 180-day withdrawal of all troops from Iraq -- and upon 
            completion of withdrawal, would terminate funding for the US 
            occupation of Iraq.&nbsp; </P>
            <P>Progressive Democrats of America was founded in 2004 to transform 
            the Democratic Party and our country.&nbsp; As a grassroots PAC 
            operating inside the Democratic Party, and outside in movements for 
            peace and justice, PDA contributed mightily to the stunning 
            electoral victory of November 2006.&nbsp; PDA strives to rebuild the 
            Democratic Party from the bottom up - from every Congressional 
            District to statewide party structures to the corridors of power in 
            Washington. More info at <A 
            href="http://pdamerica.org/">http://pdamerica.org/</A> </P>
            <P>United for Peace and Justice , the national anti-war coalition 
            with over 1,400 groups under its umbrella, is sponsoring the march.
