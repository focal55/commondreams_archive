<p>ROME - March 7  -  Greenpeace today launched a first global 
database of blacklisted, illegal fishing vessels, in a bid to tackle the 
huge problem of illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, a $9 
billion rogue industry which is having a devastating effect on fish 
stocks and biodiversity in some of the most ecologically important areas 
of the world's oceans.

<p><a href="http://www.oceans.greenpeace.org/blacklist" target="_new">The Greenpeace database</a>, which 
was launched at the meeting of the committee on Fisheries of the Food 
and Agriculture Organisations (FAO) in Rome, aims to publicly identify 
vessels which are involved in so-called 'pirate fishing', to expose the 
lack of action by the authorities to prevent the illegal trade.

<p>Today, Greenpeace also released a report (2) showing that the attempts 
at voluntary measures to curb pirate fishing by governments have had 
little effect on the levels of illegal fishing in some of the poorest 
and most desperate areas of action in the world, particularly the west 
coast of Africa.

<p>"The fact that Greenpeace has to publish a global database of 
blacklisted illegal fishing vessels demonstrates clearly just how little 
concrete action states have taken to stop this pillage of our oceans," 
Sari Tolvanen of Greenpeace International. "What's needed now is an 
official body to take charge of the policing of the worlds' oceans and 
make publicly available the information of both illegitimate and 
unlicensed fishing vessels. Until this happens, we have little hope of 
stopping the devastation which pirate fishing brings."

<p>The Greenpeace report shows that six years after the member countries of 
the FAO approved an International Plan of Action to curb illegal 
fishing, the problem is very far from being solved. It includes evidence 
gathered last year when the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, spent two months 
documenting the activities of foreign fleets off the coast of Guinea 
Conakry (3). That investigation discovered that almost half of the 92 
fishing vessels encountered in Guinea's waters were fishing illegally, 
or linked to illegal fishing activities. It has been estimated that 
sub-Saharan Africa loses around $1 billion a year due to the activities 
of such illegal trawling fleets.

<p>"The measures needed to stamp out pirate fishing are well known. Action 
is required at all levels of the chain of custody, from the net in the 
water to the fish on the shelves of supermarkets", said Sebastian 
Losada, Greenpeace Oceans campaigner. "International cooperation, 
binding laws on port control, as well as a global register of fishing 
vessels and adequate sanctions are among the tools that Governments need 
to put in place to act against the pirate fleets that are literally 
stealing the food of some of the poorest people in the world and 
destroying our marine ecosystems".

<p>Greenpeace campaigners attending the United Nations fisheries meeting in 
Rome demanded that governments must translate the existing voluntary 
frameworks and international initiatives into hard law. The 
international environmental organisation also demanded that the special 
requirements of developing countries in fighting illegal fishing be 
taken into account.
