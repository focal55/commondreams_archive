<P></P>The IPCC Assessment Report Four has made a compelling case on what global warming means to the planet this century.  It is the IPCC큦 strongest warning yet that 
drastic cuts in
carbon emissions are vital if we are to avoid a catastrophic acceleration of 
climate change.
Environmental groups are, however, deeply concerned that the IPCC's Summary for 
Policy
Makers on climate mitigation, released earlier today, includes a recommendation 
for large-
scale expansion of biofuels from monocultures, including from GM crops, even 
though
monoculture expansion is a driving force behind the destruction of rainforests 
and other
carbon sinks and reservoirs, thus accelerating climate change.  The IPCC also 
recommend
the expansion of large-scale agroforestry monoculture plantations.  These plantations, 
which
will include GM trees, are similarly linked to ecosystem destruction.  Monoculture 
expansion
is a major threat to the livelihoods and food sovereignty of communities many 
of which are
already bearing the brunt of climate change disasters caused largely by the fossil 
fuel emissions
of industrialised countries.


<P></P>Almuth Ernsting of Biofuelwatch stated: "It is already clear that the burgeoning 
demand for
biofuels that has been created to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually 
increasing
them by deforestation in the tropics and accelerating climate change. So far, 
only 1% of
global transport fuel comes from biofuels, yet already biofuels cause steep rises 
in grain and
vegetable oil prices, threatening the food security of poor people and spurring 
agricultural
expansion into forests and grasslands, on which we depend for a stable climate".


<P></P>The IPCC recommend second generation GM biofuels, which are widely believed to 
be at
least 10-15 years away from commercialisation.  There are serious concerns about 
the risks
involved in technologies which will rely heavily on GM microbes and fungi for 
the refining
process, as well as GM crops and trees.


<P></P>Mayer Hillman, senior fellow emeritus at Policy Studies Institute said: "There 
is an inherent
and acutely serious problem within the report. On the one hand, it leaves us 
in no doubt to
how vital conservation of the planet큦 ecosystems and carbon sinks are to averting 
the worst
predictions made in the previous sections of the report. On the other, it proposes 
the large
scale use of the biosphere to satisfy demand in the transport and energy sectors." 
  Simone
Lovera, managing coordinator of the Global Forest Coalition, a worldwide coalition 
of NGOs
and Indigenous Peoples Organizations added: "It is difficult to see how an emphasis 
on
protecting rainforests and curbing deforestation is compatible with using biofuels 
as a
solution to climate change when there are no policy instruments that guarantee 
biofuel
expansion without accelerating deforestation."


<P></P>The IPCC report would appear to suggest that the climate can be stabilised at 
a safe level
without reducing growth.  The signatories to the press release believe that only 
large-scale
reductions in energy use in the industrial nations, together with investment 
in sustainable
forms of  renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, can avoid the worst 
impacts of
climate change.

<P></P>2. Indonesia큦 biofuel plans, are set to expand Palm Oil production 43-fold [tinyurl.com/33lb7r] and threaten most of that country큦 remaining rainforests 
and peatlands.  
If those plans are implemented, up to 50 billion tonnes of carbon are likely 
to be released into
the atmosphere.  This is the equivalent of over six years of global fossil fuel 
burning would
clearly stand in the way of our common objective of stabilizing the climate before 
feedback
mechanisms make this impossible.  

<P></P>3. NASA have shown that the rate of Amazon deforestation directly correlates 
with the world
market price of soya [tinyurl.com/2pfga4]  That price is expected to rise sharply 
as demand
for soya biodiesel grows. Soya expansion is linked to deforestation not just 
in the Amazon but
also elsewhere, including the Pantanal, South America큦 Atlantic Forest and a 
portion of the
Paranaense forest in Paraguay and North of Argentina. In Argentina, more than 
500000 ht of
forest land were converted to soya plantations between 1998 to 2002 [tinyurl.com/28upep].

<P></P>4. Governments like the Brazilian government claim that they will only expand 
on degraded
lands. The Brazilian National Agro-energy Plan has qualified no less than 200 
million
hectares of Brazilian territory as "degraded" and thus suitable for the expansion 
of biofuel
monocultures. However, most of these so-called "degraded"  lands are either biologically 
rich
dry forest or grassland ecosystems that form the livelihood basis of Indigenous 
Peoples and
other local communities, or lands that are used for cattle ranching or small-scale 
subsistence
farming. If these lands are taken over by biofuel plantations, cattle ranches 
and small farms
will be forced to move further into the Amazon and Atlantic forests and other 
precious
ecosystems, causing accelerated deforestation.


<P></P>5. From The UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Report:
"human actions are depleting Earth큦 natural capital, putting such strain on 
the environment
that the ability of the planet큦 ecosystems to sustain future generations can 
no longer be
taken for granted. At the same time, the assessment shows that with appropriate 
actions it is
possible to reverse the degradation of many ecosystem services over the next 
50 years, but
the changes in policy and practice required are substantial and not currently 
underway."
"Although individual ecosystem services have been assessed previously, the finding 
that 60%
of a group of 24 ecosystem services examined by the MA are being degraded is 
the first
comprehensive audit of the status of Earth큦 natural capital." http://www.maweb.org/en/Article.aspx?id=58


<P></P>6. The main GM crops (soya, maize and oilseed rape) are already being used for 
biofuels,
leading to competition between food/animal feed and fuel production, notably 
with maize in
the US.  There is strong evidence [tinyurl.com/35o36j] of the genetically modified 
RR soya
undermining food sovereignty and security in Argentina and being linked to accelerated deforestation and biodiversity losses, including in the Gran Chaco forest, which 
remained
fairly intact prior to the advent of GM soya.  GM soya depends on widespread 
use of
pesticides, which encourages herbicide-resistant weeds.  For further information 
about the
negative impacts of GM crops, including cross pollination and GM contamination, 
see
www.econexus.info and www.gmfreeze.org .


<P></P>7. The US Department of Energy website [tinyurl.com/2phn7z] details the fundamental barriers to producing cellulosic ethanol which yields more energy than is used 
in the refining
process.  It is not known whether those barriers can ever be overcome.  The aim 
of cellulosic
ethanol research is to create GM plants with reduced lignin, and to create enzymes 
through
GM technologies which can effectively break down cellulose and hemicellulose, 
fundamental
building blocks of plants, on which all higher life forms depend.  No risk assessment 
has ever
been carried out.  For further information, see tinyurl.com/2vhzow.
