<p> Nii Akuetteh, Executive Director of Africa Action, said today, “Increasingly,
in Africa and globally, HIV/AIDS has a woman’s face. Not only are women
more likely to be living with HIV/AIDS, they are also more likely to be
the primary care givers for those who are HIV-positive. If we are to
successfully fight this pandemic, we need to promote strategies that
address the gender inequalities that leave women and girls most
vulnerable.”<br>
<br>
Africa Action notes that the most recent figures from the United
Nations (UN) reveal an increase in the number of adult women living
with HIV/AIDS in every region of the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, for
every ten adult men living with HIV, there are about 14 adult women who
are living with the virus. Across all age groups, almost 60% of people
living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa are women. In some countries,
like South Africa, young women aged 15—24 are up to four times more
likely to contract HIV than their male counterparts.
<br>
<br>
Ann-Louise Colgan, Director of Policy Analysis &amp; Communications at Africa Action, said today, “Across
the African continent and around the world, women are
disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other poverty-related
diseases. Greater efforts are needed to expand access to comprehensive
health care, to ensure that women and girls are protected from HIV
infection, and to guarantee that all women living with HIV/AIDS have
access to life-prolonging treatment and care.”
<br>
<br>
Africa Action supports the Protection Against Transmission of HIV for
Women and Youth Act (PATHWAY Act), which is scheduled to be
re-introduced in Congress in the coming days. This Act originated in
the office of Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA), who is a Board member
of Africa Action. The PATHWAY Act removes the current requirement that
one-third of all international prevention funding be spent on
abstinence-until-marriage programs. It also requires the President to
develop a comprehensive and integrated HIV prevention strategy to
address the vulnerabilities of women and girls in each country
receiving U.S. assistance to combat HIV/AIDS.
<br>
<br>
Marie Clarke Brill, Director of Public Education &amp; Mobilization at Africa Action, said today, “On
International Women’s Day, as we honor the critical contributions made
by women around the globe and in all areas of life, we must also
remember and address the huge challenges women still face. HIV/AIDS is
a deadly threat to women and girls across the world, and we stand
together in demanding new efforts by our government and others to
promote the health and well-being of women everywhere.”

<br>
<br>
Africa Action will shortly release an updated version of its fact sheet, “AIDS has a Woman’s Face”,
looking at the impact of HIV/AIDS on women in Africa and the Diaspora,
and advocating policy changes that can help turn the tide of this
pandemic. It will be available today on the organization’s website at: <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/toolkit_fact_sheets.php" target="_new">http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/toolkit_fact_sheets.php</a>
