<p>WASHINGTON - May 8 - Today, Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese and Rachel Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality, 
hailed the reintroduction of the Uniting American Families Act.&nbsp;The 
bill, sponsored by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Sen. Patrick Leahy, 
D-Vt., will allow citizens and legal residents in same-sex relationships 
to sponsor their partners for immigration purposes.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental principles of U.S. immigration law is the 
notion of family unification.&nbsp;Approximately 75 percent of the 1 
million green cards or immigrant visas are currently issued to family 
members of U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Tragically, same-sex 
couples are not recognized as “families” under U.S. 
immigration laws, and are unable to sponsor their partners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“For too long Congress has ignored the heart-wrenching real 
life consequences this policy has had on same-sex couples in committed, 
lifelong relationships,” said Solmonese. “Thousands of 
same-sex couples are separated or live in constant fear of being stopped 
by officials who demand to see documentation and threaten 
detention.”</p>

<p>The Uniting American Families Act applies the same standards to 
same-sex couples that the United States applies to opposite-sex couples 
where one member is seeking to bring a foreign partner into the 
country.</p>

<p>“We thank Senator Leahy and Representative Nadler for their 
continued leadership on an issue that is vitally important to so many 
same-sex couples in the U.S.,” continued Solmonese.&nbsp;“We 
also commend Immigration Equality for their ongoing legal support to 
these couples struggling to keep their families together because of this 
unjust policy.”</p>

<p>“Dividing loving families, simply because they are gay or 
lesbian, is un-American,” said Tiven. “We call on Congress 
to end the very real separation that thousands of same-sex couples and 
their families must endure because of this unequal treatment by our 
immigration system.”</p>

<p>“The promotion of family unity has long been part of federal 
immigration policy, and this bill promotes that principle by providing 
all Americans the opportunity to be with their loved ones,” said 
Leahy.&nbsp;“Our immigration laws treat gays and lesbians in 
committed relationships as second-class citizens; this injustice needs 
to change.&nbsp;It is the right thing to do for the people involved, it 
is the sensible step to take in the interest of having a fair and 
consistent policy and I hope that Congress will act to help demonstrate 
our nation’s commitment to equality under the law.”</p>

<p>“Our bill recognizes that American families come in all shapes 
and sizes,” said Nadler.&nbsp;“Our laws should work to keep 
loving families together and not tear them apart. This is a matter of 
basic fairness and compassion. I am proud to work with Senator Leahy on 
this issue. We simply ask that gay and lesbian Americans in loving, 
committed relationships receive the same treatment as everyone 
else.”</p>

<p>In many cases, binational same-sex couples face prosecution, hefty 
fines and deportations by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As 
a result, many U.S. citizens must often emigrate with their partners and 
families to countries with more fair-minded immigration laws.</p>

<p>“We have struggled so hard to play by the rules,” states 
Kelly McGowan, a U.S. citizen who, along with her partner Natalie Fuz, a 
French citizen who competes internationally for the United States in 
kickboxing tournaments, is affected by the current immigration policy. 
“If Natalie were not so talented we would be out of options and be 
forced abroad. It’s great that her abilities have helped us remain 
in the U.S. together, but I know so many talented people who have been 
forced to leave the country because of these discriminatory laws. 
It’s such a waste.”</p>

available to speak with the media on this issue, including 
Spanish-speaking couples, please contact Chris Johnson at 202/216-1580
