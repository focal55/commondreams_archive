<p>WASHINGTON  - A recently revised Commerce Department media policy is not strong enough to curb political interference in climate science at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), according to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and the Government Accountability Project (GAP). The two groups today sent a letter urging Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez to address specific shortcomings before the policy goes into effect on May 14. (To see a copy of the letter and more information, visit: www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/restoring/doc-media-policy.html.)
 
<P></P>"Under the new policy, political appointees are still able to censor scientists," said Francesca Grifo, director of the UCS Scientific Integrity Program. "This is not acceptable. The public and elected officials must have access to taxpayer-funded science to be able to address complex public health and environmental challenges." 
 
<P></P>UCS and GAP commended the department for supporting the "open dissemination of research results" and explicitly acknowledging that scientific communications-such as press releases, public speeches and media interviews-are unique and should not be constrained. Unfortunately, the policy itself undermines this commitment by requiring scientists to seek approval from the department's public affairs office for any scientific communication, the groups said. 
 
<P></P>Additionally, the policy fails in three significant ways to explicitly affirm basic free speech rights for scientists, according to UCS and GAP:
 
<P></P>. First, the policy should affirm scientists' rights to speak freely to the media on any topic, provided they make it clear that any views expressed are their own and do not reflect the Commerce Department's official position. 
 
<P></P>. Second, the policy should give scientists the right of final review of any communication citing their research. 
 
<P></P>. Third, the policy should guarantee federal employees' rights under the Whistleblower Protection Act and other free speech protections. 
 
<P></P>UCS and GAP noted that the department announced its new policy just months before the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is expected to finalize its investigation of federal media policies. The GAO report likely will offer specific recommendations for protecting federal scientists' rights.
 
<P></P>"Is Commerce trying to preempt higher standards by announcing this lax policy shortly before the GAO issues its report?" Grifo asked. 
 
<P></P>Political interference in climate change research at NOAA has become widespread and pervasive. A UCS survey of 96 NOAA scientists found that 25 had experienced pressure to eliminate the words "global warming" or "climate change" from a variety of communications. Altogether, 56 NOAA scientists reported interference in their work over the past five years.
