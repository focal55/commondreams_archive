<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 5 -  The US youth delegation traveled to the UN climate negotiations in Bali in a spirit of hopeful anticipation, to showcase youth climate leadership and the American people's desire for leadership by example and action on global warming for future generations. They had hoped that the unprecedented outpouring of support for strong climate action from students, scientists, the business community, faith leaders, and the American people over the past year would inspire US negotiators to seek a more constructive role in the Bali climate negotiations. However, the US youth delegation finds itself confronting their own State Department representatives over news reports that they are seeking to kill the Bali climate negotiations through back-channel schemes with  major emitting countries.
<p></p>
"We feel we have a responsibility to face our representatives and make sure our voice is heard, that the US must honor its promises to support a roadmap for a secure climate for future generations" said Whit Jones, 22, a youth delegate from Portland, Maine. "As a delegation of elected officials, student body presidents, international scholars, teachers, community activists, journalists, and green entrepreneurs, we hope that the State Department officials listen to our diverse and unified voice representing the position of the majority of Americans."
<p></p>
Youth representatives will be meeting with State Department representatives at 4:45pm on Dec. 5th , in Nusa Dua, Bali to see if they will confirm or deny news reports that not only that they are going back on promises by US Representative Paula Dobriansky to pursue a serious Bali roadmap but are working to persuade major emitting countries to kill the climate negotiations. If US State Department officials are indeed acting in this manner, this would amount to a betrayal of trust towards Congress, which is currently working on landmark energy and climate legislation, the 81% of Americans who want the US to lead by example on global warming, and the next generation of Americans that will face the worst impacts of climate change. <!-- #EndEditable -->
