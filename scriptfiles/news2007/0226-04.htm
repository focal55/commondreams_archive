<p>WASHINGTON - February 26 - Environmental Defense today praised the commitment of five governors to take the lead in fighting climate change by setting a regional cap on greenhouse gas emissions in Western states. The agreement is the latest in a series of major steps by states and business leaders to get emissions caps in place absent federal action.</p><p>The governors&rsquo; agreement follows efforts already underway in the Northeast, and it comes close on the heels of a landmark deal in Texas to cap emissions from the state&rsquo;s largest electrical utility.</p><p>&quot;State leaders know the dangers of climate change are too big to ignore, and business leaders know that the incentives to act are too big to pass up,&quot; said Environmental Defense President Fred Krupp. &quot;This agreement is yet another sign that the momentum for a hard cap on emissions is growing from coast to coast.&quot;</p><p>The agreement signed today commits California, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington to a regional target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It mirrors ongoing action in New England and the mid-Atlantic, where states are developing an emissions cap-and-trade system through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p><p>In Texas, Environmental Defense today announced that the Texas Pacific Group&rsquo;s buyout of the state&rsquo;s largest electric utility will contain several key environmental commitments, including support for a national emissions cap and the goals of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a coalition of leading U.S. companies and environmental groups that is urging Congress to take quick action on national cap-and-trade legislation.</p>
