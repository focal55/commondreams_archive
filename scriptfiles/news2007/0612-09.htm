<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 12 - As the Senate considers energy legislation this week, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE) called upon Senators to support multiple key clean energy priorities including upgrades to residential and commercial building codes, a national renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS), an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), and smart grid technology programs, among others.

 

<P></P>“The Senate should create a balanced national energy strategy that enhances energy reliability and security, and creates jobs and economic opportunity in the United States,” said Lisa Jacobson, executive director of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE).  “A sustainable national energy policy will also provide a down payment on reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change.”

 

<P></P>In a letter to the Senate, the BCSE outlined a range of key policies that will result in widespread deployment of many clean energy technologies.  Specifically, the Council called upon the Senate to:

 

<P></P>Adopt a National Renewable Portfolio Standard <br>
Adopt a National Energy Efficiency Resource Standard <br>
Enact and Extend Tax Incentives for Homes, Commercial Buildings and Building Equipment <br>
Upgrade Residential and Commercial Building Codes <br>
Create Tax Incentives for Advanced, High-Efficiency Appliances <br>
Promote Innovative Utility Rate Design <br>
Promote Use of Smart Meter Technology <br>
Allow Excess Electricity from Waste Heat Systems to Supplement the Nation’s Energy Supply <br>
 

<P></P>The full letter to Senators, including specific recommendations on elements for federal energy policy, is attached.

 

<P></P>The Business Council for Sustainable Energy (“the Council”) is a broad-based industry coalition of energy efficiency, natural gas and renewable energy and electric utility interests that advocates energy and environmental policies that expand markets for clean, efficient and sustainable energy products and services.  The Council’s coalition includes power developers, equipment manufacturers, independent generators, green power marketers, and gas and electric utilities, as well as several of the primary trade associations in these sectors.  More information on the Council and its activities can be found at:  <a href="http://www.bcse.org" target="_new">www.bcse.org</a>.
