<p>   WASHINGTON, DC - October 12 – Following today’s announcement by US military officials that an airstrike yesterday killed 15 civilians and wounded six, Campaign for Innocent Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) today expressed sympathy for the victims and urged compensation to surviving family members.
<p></p>
According to the Washington Post, a US airstrike launched yesterday to protect troops targeting al-Qaeda in Anbar province killed nine women and six children, and also wounded six civilians. US military spokesman Maj. Brad Leighton said, "We regret that civilians are hurt or killed while Coalition forces search to rid Iraq of terrorism.” CIVIC also noted a new U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq report, covering a three-month period through June, which documented more than 100 civilians allegedly killed by US-led forces during airstrikes or raids.
  <p></p>
“Iraq operations are about more than combating a foe on the battlefield,” said Sarah Holewinski, CIVIC’s executive director. “The US military also has a big stake in avoiding anger and resentment among the people.”
  <p></p>
US officials on the ground in Iraq have the ability to compensate civilians who have suffered losses as a result of US actions, including the wounded and the family members of those killed by yesterday’s airsrike. In addition, a humanitarian program funded through USAID – the Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War Victims Fund – has been appropriated over $40 million since 2003 to help civilian victims of war in Iraq.
  <p></p>
“The US military deserves credit for the considerable efforts it makes to avoid harming civilians. But, when civilians are killed or injured, showing compassion is crucial,” said Holewinski. “Use what you’ve got: make an apology and pay a condolence wherever appropriate.”
 <p></p>
