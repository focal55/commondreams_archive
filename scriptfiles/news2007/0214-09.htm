<p>WASHINGTON - February 14 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) released this statement today following the President’s White House press conference.

 

<p>“The President continues to deny what military and foreign policy experts, members of both parties, and the American people all know, namely that his Iraq policy has been and continues to be an enormous foreign policy and national security blunder.  The President’s decision to escalate our involvement in Iraq continues his unfortunate pattern of making the wrong decisions in our global fight against terrorism.  Our large military presence in Iraq is not making us any safer and it is not helping Iraqis reach the political solution they desperately need.  Since the President refuses to do what is right for both Iraq and our national security, Congress must take real action.  We should use the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution to end our military involvement in Iraq so we can safely redeploy our brave troops and refocus on those who attacked us on 9/11.”  

 

<p>On January 31, Feingold introduced the Iraq Redeployment Act of 2007 to end funding for the war in Iraq and force the President to safely redeploy U.S. forces out of Iraq six months from enactment.  More information on Senator Feingold’s legislation can be found <a href="http://feingold.senate.gov/%7Efeingold/releases/07/01/20070131iraq.html">here</a>.
