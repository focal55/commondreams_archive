<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 9 - The 2008 Democratic presidential candidates, except for Sens. Joe Biden and Christopher Dodd, addressed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues at a forum aired tonight on the Logo cable channel.

<P></P>Statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director,
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Inc.

<P></P>“It’s great that tonight the 2008 Democratic candidates reiterated their support for many issues critical to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans — like long-stalled protections from discrimination and hate violence, repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ and rights for our families. In 2004, at a similar forum also organized by our friends at the Human Rights Campaign, Democratic presidential candidates said the same thing.

<P></P>“All good and some great, but now we need all the candidates — particularly the frontrunners — to take a stand for us on the stump, in front of all audiences. The Republican side hasn’t given up using gay people for political gain and most of the Republican candidates bash us everywhere they go. But so far, the Democratic frontrunners rarely talk about us except at our events, such as tonight, or when asked a specific question, and even then, they tend to freeze up.

<P></P>“That’s got to stop. We challenge the Democratic frontrunners to step from behind the lavender curtain and consistently, unapologetically speak for our fundamental humanity everywhere they go.

<P></P>“On behalf of our national community, we want to thank Joe Solmonese, Melissa Etheridge, Jonathan Capehart and Margaret Carlson for pressing the candidates on key issues, including marriage equality.”

<P></P>
