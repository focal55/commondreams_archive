<p>WASHINGTON - May 2 - As the U.S. House 
of Representatives is set to vote tomorrow (Thursday) on H.R. 1592, the 
Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, anti-gay extremist 
organizations have embarked on a desperate last attempt to derail 
passage of the bill. Marking a new low in politics, these groups have 
embraced the work of a known white-supremacist filmmaker, callously 
invoked the Virginia Tech massacre, blatantly lied about the 
congressional record and even used the name and image of Jesus Christ in 
vain.</P>

<p>The Local Law Enforcement Hate 
Crimes Prevention Act would strengthen the ability of law enforcement 
officials to investigate and prosecute hate crimes when a crime is 
committed because of a person’s sexual orientation, gender, gender 
identity or disability. The current hate crimes law applies only to 
violent crimes committed due to the victim’s race, color, national 
origin and religion.&nbsp;</P>

<p>According to the FBI, 25 
Americans each day are victims of hate crimes — that means 
approximately one hate crime is committed every hour. One in six hate 
crimes are motivated by the victim’s sexual orientation.&nbsp;The 
Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act has broad public and 
bipartisan support — including 73 percent of the American people 
and more than 210 law enforcement, civil rights, civic and religious 
organizations — and has previously passed both houses of Congress 
in recent years, but was ultimately derailed by Republican leadership 
bowing to pressure from Republican extremists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<p>In recent weeks, religious 
right leaders have been caught outright lying about the hate crimes 
bill: claiming that no federal hate crimes law yet exists (it does, has 
for 40 years and already includes them (i.e., people of faith)) and that 
the proposed amendment to the hate crimes law would criminalize hate 
speech (it does not). Some of these same leaders have also been caught 
disseminating the anti-gay works of a white-supremacist filmmaker. And 
just last week, the head of the Family Research Council invoked the 
Virginia Tech victims to argue against the hate crimes bill. <b>Details 
of these incidents can be found below.</b></P>

<p>“It’s no surprise 
the religious right is so concerned about hate speech — for them, 
hate appears to be a cottage industry,” Solmonese added. 
“But they have nothing to fear. Even after the hate crimes 
legislation is passed, the religious right will continue to have the 
federally protected right to preach hatred from the pulpit and 
disseminate the videos of white supremacists.</P>

<p>“The religious 
right’s attempts to derail hate crimes legislation and block 
equality for all Americans are about as predictable as the sun rising 
each day,” said Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese.&nbsp;“There are two differences this year from past 
years. First, the American people have demonstrated they have no 
tolerance for the right wing’s divisive agenda and will hold them 
accountable for playing wedge politics across this country. Second, 
it’s clear that the right wing understands that the tides are 
against them because their tactics to stop hate crimes legislation have 
become more desperate and disgusting each day. Instead of engaging in a 
civil debate on the merits of this bill, they have instead chosen to 
spread lies and embrace white supremacists and hate groups.&nbsp;It is 
unconscionable that these groups could use the memory of Virginia Tech, 
one of the greatest tragedies in American history, to twist and contort 
the truth about this bill.”</P>

Right-Wing Groups to Defeat Hate Crimes Bill</b></P>

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p>Last week, Stephen Bennett, a 
spokesman for the Concerned Women for America, used his action network 
to promote the anti-gay videos of John Smith, a white-supremacist 
filmmaker with numerous videos posted on YouTube.com. The 
filmmaker’s hateful online video collection includes such titles 
as “Keep America White,” “Black Intelligence” (a 
video about how blacks are mentally inferior to whites) and 
“Hitler” (an homage to Hitler on the occasion of his 
birthday).</P>

<p>When YouTube pulled the videos 
for violating its terms of service, another former employee of both 
Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council, Peter 
LaBarbera, continued to promote the white supremacist’s anti-gay 
videos, now posted on a religious right website in 
Massachusetts.</P>

<p>In an action alert to members 
nationwide, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, 
incredibly used the memory of the Virginia Tech massacre to argue 
against H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention 
Act.</P>

<p><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Perkins 
wrote:</font></i></p>

<p>“Under this legislation, 
the crimes at Virginia Tech, which some are calling one of the deadliest 
rampages in U.S. history, would not be punishable to the level of these 
so-called ‘hate crimes.’ If the House approves H.R. 1592 and 
the Senate follows, a homosexual would have more federal protection 
under the law than the 32 victims of last week’s 
massacre.”</P>

<p><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Barber wrote:</font></i></p>

<p>“The FBI’s latest 
statistics show that there were zero ‘hate crimes’ murders 
committed against homosexuals or those perceived to be homosexual in 
2005; yet we already know of 32 so-called ‘hate crimes’ 
murders committed against perceived ‘rich kids’ in a single 
day. But under H.R. 1592, those ‘rich kids’ would shamefully 
be denied the same protections and justice as homosexuals. The whole 
‘hate crimes’ concept really places logic and reason on its 
head.”</P>

<p>The Traditional Values

‘Wanted Poster’</i></b></font></li>

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p>The Traditional Values 
Coalition produced a “wanted poster” in which Jesus Christ, 
wearing a crown of thorns, is wanted for violating the proposed hate 
crimes bill. The poster states that Christ is “wanted for 
revealing the truth about homosexuality in ‘The Bible’ and 
encouraging his followers not to offend God by committing such 
behavior.”</P>

<p>A former lawyer for the 
American Family Association, Joe Murray, explained:&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 “How could a group purporting Christian values denigrate the 
image of their, and my, savior, by placing Him in the same category as 
Willie Horton? When did it become acceptable to turn a man who preached 
‘love thy neighbor’ into a biblical billy club? Christ is a 
source of salvation, not spin.&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 “This is how far separated Christian activists, possessed by a 
deep-seeded hatred of homosexuals, have become from Christian 
principles.”<br>

Perkins, Concerned Women for America, Etc. Falsely Claim Hate Crimes 
Bill Would Make Anti-Gay ‘Thoughts’ 
Illegal</i></b></font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p>One of the most frequently 
promoted lies by the opposition is that the hate crimes law will make 
anti-gay bigots criminally liable for their hate speech. While it is 
certainly un-American and un-Christian to embrace the message of white 
supremacists and hate groups, the religious right has nothing to fear 
from the hate crimes bill as it applies only to acts of violence. 
Nothing in this act would prohibit the lawful expression of one’s 
deeply held religious beliefs. As hurtful as these comments can be, 
people will remain free to say things like: “Homosexuality is 
sinful,” “Homosexuality is an abomination” or 
“Homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom of 
heaven.”</P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The truth is that neither 
the current hate crimes law nor the expanded measures criminalize 
thoughts or speech; they</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">only</font></i> <font size="3">criminalize</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">violent</font></i><b><font face="Times 
New Roman" size="3">acts</font></b><font size="3">. The hate crimes 
statute is</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">only</font></i> <font size="3">invoked to allow a federal 
investigation and the prosecution of bias-motivated violence if — 
and only if — it is necessary to achieve an effective and just 
result. That only happens</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">after</font></i> <font size="3">a violent crime is committed, 
which debunks their “thought crimes” talking 
point.</font></P>

<p><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">James Dobson:</font></i></p>

<p>“There’s a vote 
coming up on some insidious legislation in the United States Congress 
that could silence and punish Christians for their moral beliefs,” 
he said on his radio broadcast yesterday. “That means that as a 
Christian — if you read the Bible a certain way with regard to 
morality — you may be guilty of committing a ‘thought 
crime.’”</P>

<p><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Andrea Lafferty, executive 
director of the Traditional Values Coalition:</font></i></p>

<p>“Most Christians might as 
well rip the pages which condemn homosexuality right out of their 
Bibles, because this bill will make it illegal to publicly express the 
dictates of their religious beliefs.”</P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The ultimate proof:</font></b> <font size="3">The federal hate 
crimes law has been on the books for 40 years and not a single person 
has ever been charged with having “illegal thoughts.” The 
claim is absurd.&nbsp;</font></P>
