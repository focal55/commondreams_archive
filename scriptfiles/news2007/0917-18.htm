<p>WASHINGTON - September 17 - The Senate Democratic Policy Committee has announced that it will hear testimony this Friday regarding abuses by government contractors during the Iraq War. The hearing, entitled “The Mistreatment of Iraq Contracting Whistleblowers,” will focus on the experiences of the employee-whistleblowers who report contractor misconduct, and will include significant information about Iraqi contracting abuses. The hearing will be held in the Dirksen Senate Building, room 226.
<P></P>
Among those scheduled to testify is Bunnatine Greenhouse, who served as the top civilian contracting officer for the Army Corps of Engineers until she was demoted in retaliation for her opposition to “casual and clubby” contracting practices in the run-up to the War. Ms. Greenhouse has described a controversial five year, no-bid, multi-billion dollar contract awarded to Halliburton/KBR in 2003 as “the most blatant and improper contracting abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career.”
<P></P>
Also testifying will be Stephen M. Kohn, President of the National Whistleblower Center and co-counsel for Ms. Greenhouse.
