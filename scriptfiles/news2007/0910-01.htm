WASHINGTON - September 10 - When General Petraeus testifies today, Monday, before the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees in his effort to justify allocating another $190 billion more for war, anti-war activists will be there to demonstrate that the public is not buying the Bush/Petraeus spin.  CODEPINK, Iraq Veterans Against the War and many others will be inside the hearing room, in the hallway and outside of the Cannon Congressional building to say: "We are not buying more war. There is no military solution. Bring the troops home!"  Some who will be attending will be risking arrest. CODEPINK will also create a powerful visual to complement Monday's anti-war message .

<P></P>
<strong>When:</strong> Noon, Monday, September 10th
<P></P>
<strong>Where:</strong> In front of the Cannon House Building at Independence & New Jersey Ave.
<P></P>
<strong>Why:</strong> Peace groups and concerned citizens will rally just before General Petraeus and U.S. ambassador Ryan C. Crocker testify in the Cannon Caucus Room 345 at 12:30pm

<P></P>"In recent months we have seen a growing determination of the people of this country to bring our troops home. The Bush/Petraeus spin is designed to paint a false, rosy picture of Iraq to convince the public that we should stay the course. We will be inside and outside Congress to tell our elected officials that the American people are not buying this war, and neither should they," said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the national women's peace group.

<P></P>"General betray-us is just another face in a long string of lies this administration has spun. As an Iraq veteran I wonder why Congress still believes the president and those he sends forward in his stead.  These types of lying leaders are why officers were fragged in the Vietnam war," said Geoff Millard, DC chapter president of Iraq Veterans Against the War. "It's time to stop the lying and bring the troops home."
