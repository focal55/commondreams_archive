<p>   NEW YORK - October 14 – New documents uncovered as a result of an American Civil 
Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union lawsuit reveal that the 
Department of Defense secretly issued hundreds of national security letters 
(NSLs) to obtain private and sensitive records of people within the United 
States without court approval. A comprehensive analysis of 455 NSLs issued 
after 9/11 shows that the Defense Department seems to have collaborated with 
the FBI to circumvent the law, may have overstepped its legal authority to 
obtain financial and credit records, provided misleading information to 
Congress, and silenced NSL recipients from speaking out about the records 
requests, according to the ACLU. </p>

<p>"Once again, the Bush administration's unchecked authority has led to abuse 
and civil liberties violations," said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. 
Romero. "The documents make clear that the Department of Defense may have 
secretly and illegally conducted surveillance beyond the powers it was granted 
by Congress. It also appears as if the FBI is serving as a lackey for the DoD 
in misusing the Patriot Act powers. At the very least, it certainly looks like 
the FBI and DoD are conspiring to evade limits placed on the Department of 
Defense's surveillance powers."</p>

<p>NSLs are secretly issued by the government to obtain access to personal 
customer records from Internet service providers, financial institutions, and 
credit reporting agencies. In almost all cases, recipients of the NSLs are 
forbidden, or "gagged," from disclosing that they have received the letters. 
While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI-issued NSLs is 
mandatory, the Defense Department's NSL power is more limited in scope, and, 
in most cases, compliance with Defense Department demands is not mandatory. 
</p>

<p>In April, the ACLU filed Freedom of Information Act requests with both the 
Defense Department and the CIA seeking all documents related to their use of 
NSLs to gain access to personal records of people in the United States. And in 
June, the ACLU filed a lawsuit to force those agencies to turn over the 
requested documents. The Defense Department's NSL documents are the first 
materials received by the ACLU as part of this lawsuit.</p>

<p>"The expanded role of the military in domestic intelligence gathering is 
troubling. These documents reveal that the military is gaining access to 
records here in the U.S. – in secret and without any meaningful oversight," 
said Melissa Goodman, staff attorney with the ACLU's National Security 
Project. "There are real concerns about the use of this intrusive surveillance 
power."</p>

<p>As first revealed by the <i>New York Times</i> in January, recipients of 
the letters have reported confusion over the scope of the information 
requested and whether compliance with the NSLs is legally required. The 
documents released to the ACLU confirm that the letters are coercive and do 
not make clear that compliance with the Defense Department's "requests" for 
information is voluntary.</p>

<p>These revelations about the Defense Department's use of NSLs come on the 
heels of widespread reports of other significant government abuses of the NSL 
power. A March 2007 report from the Justice Department's Inspector General 
(IG) estimated that the FBI issued over 143,000 NSLs between 2003 and 2005, an 
astronomical increase from previous years. The IG's report also found numerous 
examples of improper and illegal uses of NSLs by the FBI.</p>

<p>The Defense Department documents uncovered today contain numerous 
revelations of potential abuses of the National Security Letter power: </p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Documents show the Defense 
Department may be flouting the law and, by simply asking the FBI to issue 
the NSLs on their behalf, accessing documents it is not entitled to receive. 
There is no evidence that the FBI has ever turned down such a request. (See 
document page <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/60.pdf" target="_blank">60</a>) 
</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The Defense Department told 
Congress that it seeks NSL assistance from the FBI only in joint 
investigations, but an internal program review shows that the military asks 
the FBI to issue NSLs in strictly Defense Department investigations. (See 
document pages <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/178.pdf" target="_blank">178-80</a>) 
</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">A heavily redacted copy of 
the results of an internal program review prompted after the <i>New York 
Times</i> reported potential abuses of the military's NSL power shows that 
the Defense Department has issued NSLs with little guidance or training, no 
coordination within the military, no real recordkeeping, and an inadequate 
review process. A Defense Department action memo identifies and recommends 
fixing these flaws. (See document pages <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/49.pdf" target="_blank">49</a>, 

<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/54.pdf" target="_blank">54-73</a>) 
</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Although compliance with 
Defense Department-issued NSLs is voluntary, the coercive language found in 
these letters would lead a reader to believe compliance was mandatory. For 
example, one NSL was stamped multiple times with the words "subpoena" and 
"non-disclosure obligation" to intimidate its recipients with authority the 
Defense Department does not have. According to Navy records, no credit 
agency has ever refused to comply with the military's requests, and only two 
financial institutions have refused to comply. (See document pages <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/16.pdf" target="_blank">16-18</a>, 
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/87.pdf" target="_blank">87</a>, 
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/1040.pdf" target="_blank">1040</a>) 
</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The Defense Department 
appears to "gag" all NSL recipients as a matter of course, and, despite 
recent changes to the law, the NSLs issued by the Defense Department do not 
inform recipients of their new right to challenge the request and gag order 
in court. (See document pages <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/87.pdf" target="_blank">87</a>, 
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/303.pdf" target="_blank">303</a>) 
</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The Defense Department can 
use NSLs to gather information on individuals not suspected of wrongdoing. 
(See document pages <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/112.pdf" target="_blank">112-114</a>) 

</li></ul>
<p>"The Fourth Amendment protects against the government's effort to rummage 
broadly through the papers and documents of individuals without narrow and 
specific justifications," said Arthur Eisenberg, NYCLU Legal Director. "Yet 
the excessive secrecy surrounding the military's use of national security 
letters opens the door to abuse. Without oversight and accountability, there 
is nothing to stop the Defense Department from engaging in broad fishing 
expeditions."</p>
<p>The ACLU has successfully challenged the NSL power in two separate 
lawsuits. In one case involving an Internet Service Provider, a federal court 
in September struck down as unconstitutional the National Security Letter 
provision of the Patriot Act authorizing the FBI to demand a range of personal 
records without court approval, and to gag those who receive NSLs from 
discussing the letters.</p>
<p>Senator Russ Feingold and Representative Jerrold Nadler have introduced 
legislation to rein in this unchecked NSL authority. The ACLU urges immediate 
consideration of these bills in light of this new information.</p>
<p>Attorneys in the case are Goodman and Jameel Jaffer of the ACLU's National 
Security Project and Eisenberg of the NYCLU.</p>
