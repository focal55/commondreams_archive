<p>WASHINGTON - November 27 - Amnesty International condemns the new arrests of political activists inside Myanmar, despite the commitment by Prime Minister Thein Sein to the U.N. Special Representative Ibrahim Gambari in early November that no more arrests would be carried out.

Amnesty International confirms that the following arrests have occurred since early November:
<ul>
    <li> On November 4, U Gambira, head of the All-Burma Monks Alliance and a leader of the September protests, was arrested and reportedly charged with treason. Two of his family members previously detained as "hostages" in an attempt to force him out of hiding, have been kept in detention;
    <li> On November 13, the government arrested Su Su Nway, a member of the youth wing of the main opposition National League for Democracy party. Fellow youth activist Bo Bo Win Hlaing was arrested along with her while putting up anti-government posters;
    <li> On November 14, at least three people were arrested in Yangon for passing out anti-government pamphlets;
    <li> On November 15, authorities raided a monastery in western Rakhine State, and arrested monk U Than Rama, wanted for his involvement in the September protests. He was reportedly beaten during the raid and his whereabouts remain unknown;
    <li> On November 20, Myint Naing, a senior member of the National League for Democracy was detained;
    <li> On November 20, ethnic Arakanese leader U Tin Ohn was detained and his whereabouts remain unknown;
    <li> On November 20-21, other ethnic leaders, including Arakanese Cin Sian Thang and U Aye Thar Aung, Naing Ngwe Thein from the Mon National Democracy Front, and Kachin political leader U Hkun Htoo were rounded up but released after questioning;
    <li> On November 26, Aung Zaw Oo, a member of the Human Rights Defenders and Promoters group, was arrested in Yangon, likely on account of his involvement in planning events for International Human Rights Day on December 10.
</ul>

Amnesty International is deeply disappointed by the fact that these arrests are still taking place despite the government's promises to the contrary. Just last week, the Myanmar government attended ASEAN's 40th Anniversary Summit, where it signed the organization's new Charter committing it to the "promotion and protection of human rights".

To date, up to 700 people arrested during and since the September protests remain behind bars, while 1,150 political prisoners held prior to the protests have not been released. <!-- #EndEditable -->
