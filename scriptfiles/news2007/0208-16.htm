<p> LONDON - February 8 - G7 Ministers of Finance should make good their Gleneagles commitment to the 40 million people living with HIV and AIDS by coming up with a clear funding plan for universal access to prevention, treatment and care by 2010, according to anti-poverty agency ActionAid.
<P>“More than $8billion is needed for the global AIDS response this year while three out of four people still lack access to anti-retroviral treatment,” said Aditi Sharma, International HIV/AIDS Coordinator for ActionAid.</P>
<P>“Chancellor Angela Merkel has made HIV and AIDS a priority for the G8 Summit but unless finance ministers do so as well, it’s a morally bankrupt promise.” </P>
<P>“The AIDS pandemic is recognised as a real threat to economic stability in many parts of the world and it belongs on the finance ministers’ agenda alongside reform of the IMF and financial stability in emerging economies,” said Patrick Watt, Policy Advisor at ActionAid.</P>
<P>This departure from previously made pledges also raises questions about the continuity of the German G8 agenda. Chancellor Merkel has declared her ambition to tackle poverty and in 2005 specific commitments were made on aid, but finance ministers do not appear to be following in her footsteps.</P>
<P>"There are fears that Africa will be relegated to the margins of the international community’s agenda at a time when it needs sustained support to confront the challenges of HIV," said Watt.</P>
<P>“In an increasingly inter-connected world, it is time for rich countries to take their share of responsibility for the challenges facing Africa and follow through on commitments pledged in the past.”&nbsp; </P>
