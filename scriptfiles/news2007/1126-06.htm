<p>WASHINGTON - November 26 - It has been reported that the Bush Administration has lowered its expectations of major political progress in Iraq.
<P></P>
Today Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement:
<P></P>
“By resetting expectations for political progress in Iraq, the Bush Administration is hoping to slow down the erosion of American public opinion for the continued occupation of Iraq. With the bar so low, any minor achievement can now be trumpeted as a major accomplishment,” Kucinich said.
<P></P>
“This Administration clearly plans on staying in Iraq indefinitely. They are trying to prepare the American public to tolerate the continuation of the occupation.
<P></P>
“Almost 4,000 of our brave men and women have died in an unjust and unnecessary war. More than one million innocent Iraqi civilians have perished. When will it be clear to this Administration that we are not winning this war?
<P></P>
“The Administration led us to war based on lies. Military experts, diplomats and foreign policy experts all agree this war cannot be won militarily. We need to stop putting our troops in harm’s way and pull out of Iraq now.”
<P></P>
Kucinich introduced <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-1234" target="_new">HR 1234</a> on February 28, 2007, which is a plan for the United States to use existing money to bring the troops and necessary equipment home and transition to an international security and peacekeeping force.
