<p>OTTAWA -  November 16 - 1960s icon and former California Senator Tom Hayden reacted strongly to the news that the Supreme Court of Canada refused yesterday to hear appeals from two former U.S. soldiers seeking refugee status in Canada. Hayden urged Canadians to allow the soldiers to stay in Canada.
 <P></P>
 Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey sought refugee status on the grounds of their opposition to the war in Iraq. It is estimated that there are as many as 300 former U.S. soldiers in Canada who similarly face court martial and possible imprisonment for desertion. As usual in such decisions, the High Court gave no reasons.

 "I hope that the Canadian people stop the Bush Administration from using the Harper government to hound a handful of war resisters and erase Canada's proud heritage as a haven for resisters and refugees," said Tom Hayden from his home in California.
  <P></P>
 Hayden visited Ottawa in April 2005, accompanied by the mother of a U.S. soldier who was killed in action in Iraq, to support the bid by former U.S. soldiers to remain in Canada.
  <P></P>
 During the visit, Hayden hearkened back to the Vietnam War era when many Americans sought refuge in Canada. "Looking back, it was a proud chapter in Canadian history, and relations between the United States and Canada were not damaged at all," he said.<!-- #EndEditable -->
