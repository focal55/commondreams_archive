<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 13 - Seven peace activists were acquitted
today by a jury of their peers in a criminal case stemming from an
anti-war protest inside a Senate office building.
<P></P>The group of activists from three different states and the District
of Columbia were arrested on March 29, the same hour the U.S. Senate
voted to spend $95 billion more on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
They were charged with unlawful conduct.
       <P></P>"Today was a victory for justice and the people of this nation," said
Gordon Clark one of the seven defendants pro se, and the coordinator
of the National Campaign of Nonviolent Resistance.
       <P></P>The jury deliberated for four and a half hours Thursday before
returning a unanimous not guilty verdict. The defense successfully
argued their group was not any more disruptive than a comparable sized
group of tourists, school groups or others.
       <P></P>The protest was organized by organizers of the National Campaign of
Nonviolent resistance and a couple local peace activists.
       <P></P>"It wasn't just us who won today," said Eve Tetaz, 75, a retired D.C.
public school teacher. "A jury of our peers decided that we had a
right to dissent and to petition our government for a redress of
grievances."
       <P></P>Tetaz faces several other charges for nonviolently protesting the war
including contempt of court since she has violated two stay away
orders from the Capitol area.
               <P></P> "I will not remain silent as long as people are being
killed in this illegal and immoral war," she said.
                <P></P>
The other defendants pro se in this trial were David
Barrows, Gordon Clark, Joy First, Ellen Barfield, Samuel Crook and
Malachy Kilbride. The seven had faced a maximum sentence of 6 months
in prison and a $500 fine.<!-- #EndEditable -->
