<p>WASHINGTON - December 5 - The League of Women Voters today praised the introduction of the bipartisan Presidential Funding Act of 2007 by Senators Russ Feingold (D WI) and Susan Collins (R ME) and Representatives Chris Shays (R CT) and David Pryce (D NC).  The legislation would revive the federal election process and level the playing field for all candidates.

“The dollar sign has too tight a hold over our democracy,” said national League president Mary G. Wilson. “All signs point to the 2008 election being the first billion-dollar presidential election in our nation’s history.  That is a new record that many of us will not be celebrating,” Wilson said.  “I can’t imagine that our next president wants the label – “Billion Dollar President” – affixed to their legacy.”
<P></P>
“This is a make-or-break year for the presidential public financing system in this country,” said Wilson.  “This legislation is an essential step toward leveling the playing field and revitalizing our elections.  “For the past thirty years, every president has been elected based on a publicly-financed general election.  The next president should come into office on the strength of public funds, not private donations primarily from wealthy donors and special interest bundlers,” Wilson stated.
<P></P>
“Americans deserve a fair and healthy election system – one in which candidates are more concerned with the issues than their daily fundraising reports,” added Wilson.  It is imperative that this Congress address the fundamental weaknesses in our presidential financing system before it is too late.”
