<p> NATIONWIDE  &ndash;- May 1 – The American Civil Liberties Union called today’s FISA hearing 
held by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee a setback to the rule of law. 
The committee met to discuss and hear testimony from administration officials 
about proposed "modernization" to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
submitted by Department of Justice and intelligence community officials. </p>
<p>"Broadening FISA would only reward and legitimize both the Justice Department 
and executive branch’s numerous violations of the law," said Caroline 
Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "Giving the 
Department of Justice more latitude to conduct warrantless searches is ludicrous 
when you consider that it has shown no restraint with the power it already has. 
If a little boy destroys a tricycle, you don’t hand him the keys to the 
car."</p>

<p>While the Administration claims that the proposed FISA changes would 
"modernize" the law, in truth they would gut the judicial oversight mechanisms 
carefully crafted to prevent abuse, while expanding the scope of communications 
that can be intercepted under FISA. Ironically, the changes would return 
intelligence gathering to the pre-FISA era and earlier, when warrants were 
largely optional and abusive spying was not limited to people who had done 
something wrong. </p>
<p>In fact, despite many recent hearings about "modernization" and "technology 
neutrality," the administration has not publicly provided Congress with a single 
example of how current FISA standards have either prevented the intelligence 
community from using new technologies, or proven unworkable for the agents 
tasked with following them. </p>
<p>More disturbingly, this bill includes complete immunity - from criminal 
prosecution as well as civil liability - for the telecom companies’ 
participation in the National Security Agency’s illegal warrantless wiretapping 
program. The telecom companies provided customer call data on millions of 
Americans without any suspicion of wrongdoing. The ACLU noted that this rush to 
retroactive immunity for an entire industry in the absence of a full and 
thorough airing of the facts is unprecedented.</p>
<p>"Congress should not allow the Administration to treat innocent Americans as 
suspects," said Fredrickson. "It also most certainly should not hand telecom 
companies a get-out-of-jail-free card for violating their customers’ privacy. 
Our lawmakers must prove that they are working on behalf of their constituents - 
not big business."</p>
