<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - MAY 31 -Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder released the following statement in response to the global warming “strategy” unveiled by the White House today:

 

<P></P>“The plan announced by President Bush today is a complete charade.  It is an attempt to make the Bush administration look like it takes global warming seriously without actually doing anything to curb emissions.  If President Bush were serious about global warming, he would join the U.N. talks that are already underway, or he’d listen to the German Chancellor’s ideas and discuss global warming at the G8.  Today’s proposal is an outrageous attempt to derail those talks rather than contribute to them.

 

<P></P>“The United States produces 25 percent of the world’s greenhouse gasses, and it has a moral responsibility help lead the fight against global warming.  The American people get this.  But President Bush isn’t leading—he isn’t even following.”
