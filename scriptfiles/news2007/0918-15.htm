<p> WASHINGTON - September 18 - Members of the National Religious Leadership Roundtable (NRLR), a program of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, join the Bishops and Elders Council in its support of the passage and signing into law of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). At its annual convention held earlier this month, the Bishops and Elders Council, a nationwide network of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) affirming churches and organizations touching the lives of 98 million Americans, urged U.S. Congress to pass ENDA and President Bush to sign it into law.
<p></p>
ENDA would prohibit discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It remains legal in 31 states to fire or deny employment to someone based solely upon sexual orientation. In 39 states, it is legal to fire or refuse to hire someone for being transgender. ENDA is expected to go through critical steps this week (mark up) in the legislative process.
<p></p>
Statement by the Rev. Rebecca Voelkel, NRLR member and director of the Institute for Welcoming Resources, on behalf of the NRLR
<p></p>
“The National Religious Leadership Roundtable joins the Bishops and Elders Council in calling upon the U.S. Congress to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and on President Bush to sign it into law.
 <p></p>
“In the United States today, the sad truth is that intolerance, oppression and even violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are bathed in Christian theology. Those who violate lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people often do so believing they are blessed and sent forth by God.
 <p></p>
“In such a context, it is critical to hear the voices of Christian leaders — bishops, elders and heads of communion — who courageously and with conviction offer a different voice: The love of God calls all Christians to extravagant welcome —  in church and in society.”

 <i>The mission of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is to build the grassroots power of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. We do this by training activists, equipping state and local organizations with the skills needed to organize broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation, and building the organizational capacity of our movement. Our Policy Institute, the movement’s premier think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality and to counter right-wing lies. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a nation that respects the diversity of human expression and identity and creates opportunity for all. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Cambridge.
