<P></P>"The original intent of Mother's Day was not to give your mom chocolates or breakfast in bed, but for mothers to join together to stop war," says Medea Benjamin, cofounder of CODEPINK. "With the war raging in Iraq and another war looming in Iran, we invite mothers all over this country to join us in demanding a peaceful world for ourselves and our children." CODEPINK is holding Mother's Day actions in many cities including San Francisco and Los Angeles, New York, Memphis, Arizona and many others-as well as hosting mom and daughter teams from Florida and North Carolina.
