<p>WASHINGTON - January 19 - <FONT size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contrary to the wishes
      of Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives, which last week
      passed a bill that would increase the
      minimum wage,&nbsp;the Senate&nbsp;Finance Committee on Wednesday&nbsp;<A href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701106.html">approved</A> a
      package of tax "sweeteners" for small business&nbsp;to be combined with&nbsp;the&nbsp;minimum wage&nbsp;hike.
      The biggest tax break is an extension and expansion of the Work Opportunity
      Tax Credit, an incentive for businesses to hire welfare recipients&nbsp;and
individuals from other at-risk groups. <SPAN class=812294818-18012007>Other breaks would allow restaurants and retail stores bigger tax write-offs, expand the number of businesses allowed to use the more advantageous cash method of accounting, and loosen various tax rules relating to Subchapter S corporations (which pay no corporate level tax).</SPAN></FONT>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN class=812294818-18012007>To
      his credit, Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) also included in his&nbsp;bill&nbsp;several
        revenue offsets to ensure that the bill as a whole is budget-neutral.
        The biggest offset would restrict an especially egregious form of tax
        shelters</SPAN> known as sale-in, lease-out (SILOs). These arrangements,
        which can involve an American bank buying something like a subway or
        sewer system in another country and "leasing" it back to the foreign
        government for tax advantages, were already banned starting in 2004 but
        that ban would retroactively apply to deals made before 2004 under this
  provision. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another offset would increase
    restrictions on "inversion transactions," <SPAN class=812294818-18012007>in
        which American companies set up phony offshore "headquarters" to avoid
  U.S. taxes.</SPAN>&nbsp;<SPAN class=468385318-18012007>The bill would limit the amount of compensation that executives can postpone paying taxes on to $1 million a year (for most workers, the limit is $15,000). It would crack down on wealthy people who renounce their U.S. citizenship and move abroad, by making them pay taxes on their unrealized capital gains when they leave the country.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Senators from both parties
    say that the minimum wage hike will not get the 60 votes needed to pass if
    it's not combined with tax breaks
    for small business, although the rationale for "compensating" small businesses
  has been <A href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=12353">questioned</A>. Under the U.S. Constitution, tax legislation must originate in the House, and House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel (D-NY) could use this rule to stop this legislation from moving if a deal is not worked out between him and Baucus. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><STRONG>House of Representatives Passes CLEAN Act, First Step in Ending Subsidies to Big Oil</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In what some Democratic members of Congress are calling a first step towards a larger change in energy policy, the House of Representatives on Thursday <A class="" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801386.html">passed</A> the
    Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation (CLEAN) Act (H.R. 6).
    The legislation only repeals two of the tax subsidies directed at oil and
    gas companies that CTJ has criticized.&nbsp;One is&nbsp;the domestic manufacturing
    tax deduction, which is available for oil and gas companies only because
    a provision of the 2004 tax cut bill redefined manufactured goods to include
    oil and gas. The White House has argued that it would be unfair for manufacturing
    companies, but not energy companies, to take advantage of this tax subsidy.
    The other is the five-year amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures
    (the faster write-off of the cost of exploring for oil and gas, in other
    words), which would be changed to a seven year amortization. Other provisions
    would close loopholes that have allowed companies drilling on public lands
    to avoid paying royalties. Around $14 billion of savings would be reallocated
  towards the development of alternative energy sources.</FONT><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>

<DIV><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></DIV>
<DIV><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN>On Wednesday newly elected&nbsp;<STRONG>Arkansas</STRONG> Governor Mike Beebe kept a campaign promise and <A title=http://www.pbcommercial.com/articles/2007/01/17/ap-state-ar/d8mn5pkg0.txt href="http://www.pbcommercial.com/articles/2007/01/17/ap-state-ar/d8mn5pkg0.txt">proposed a cut</A> in
          the state's sales tax on food. The proposal would cut the state's 6
          percent sales&nbsp;tax, as it applies to groceries,&nbsp;by half. The Governor hopes to eventually repeal the tax on food&nbsp;altogether.
          However, the price tag for this cut is over $200 million and the benefits
          from this tax cut aren't targeted towards those who need it. Also,
despite the state's recent <SPAN>higher-than-expected revenues,</SPAN> many advocates are worried the funding for the tax cut could come from education or other programs. </SPAN></font></DIV>
<DIV><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></DIV>
<DIV><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN>A similar discussion
          is&nbsp;taking place&nbsp;in <STRONG>Idaho</STRONG>,
          where Governor Butch Otter&nbsp;is proposing&nbsp;a more progressive approach to this issue. His proposal would keep the&nbsp;grocery&nbsp;tax&nbsp;and would instead offer a low-income tax credit designed to offset&nbsp;it.&nbsp;For
          more on the&nbsp;relative merits of&nbsp;exemptions and credits as&nbsp;strategies for making sales taxes less unfair,&nbsp;check

    so-called "sin taxes" are often seen by lawmakers as an easy way to raise
    extra money without the public anger that so often follows attempts to raise
  income or property taxes.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>However, as this ITEP <A title=http://www.itepnet.org/pb1cigs.pdf href="http://www.itepnet.org/pb1cigs.pdf"><FONT title=http://www.itepnet.org/pb1cigs.pdf color=#000080>policy brief</FONT></A><SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>shows, cigarette taxes are very regressive, forcing poor smokers to pay much more of their income in taxes than more affluent smokers.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Perhaps more worrying is the fact that all three proposals discuss using some of the revenue from increased cigarette taxes to pay for increased health care funding.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>While providing extra funding for health care is a noble and popular goal, in recent years cigarette tax receipts have been declining.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Indeed, higher cigarette taxes have proven effective in lowering the smoking rate, one of the goals of such tax increases.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>However, this means that cigarette taxes will be an unstable revenue source into the future.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>If lawmakers are serious about increasing the funds available for health care in their state, they must find a growing revenue source, not a shrinking one. </font></P>
