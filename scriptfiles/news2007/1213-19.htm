<p>WASHINGTON - December 13 -- Director of National Intelligence, Michael McConnell, and 
Attorney General, Michael Mukasey, were scheduled to hold a closed congressional 
briefing today with legislation aimed at amending the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act (FISA). The Senate is expected to vote in the coming days on 
FISA legislation largely shaped by the White House and passed by the Senate 
Intelligence Committee. The bill includes a provision that would give immunity 
to telecommunications companies who aided in the administration’s domestic 
spying. Also today, a bill introduced by Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) that would 
substitute the government as the plaintiff in cases currently pending against 
the telecoms was voted down in a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
“They say history repeats itself and, if Congress isn’t 
careful, sadly it will prove this saying true,” said Caroline Fredrickson, 
director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office.&nbsp; “What ever happened to once bitten, 
twice shy?&nbsp; Last summer, both houses 
of Congress blindly followed the administration and Director McConnell and 
passed legislation that stripped Fourth Amendment protections from 
Americans.&nbsp; Now, with Congress 
staring down a February 1st deadline, the administration is once again beating 
the war drums and sending its ambassadors to the Hill.&nbsp; Members of Congress should not again be 
so easily intimidated.&nbsp; They have 
the chance to rewrite history and they should seize it.” 

<p>Director McConnell played a central role in negotiations 
around the so-called Protect America Act (PAA), rushed through Congress in 
August. &nbsp;Acting on behalf of the 
White House, McConnell worked to convince members to “modernize” FISA by 
spinning a story about American soldiers put in harm’s way because of crucial 
gaps in FISA (when it was in reality the only gaps were due to bureaucratic 
blunders at the Justice Department). McConnell also made inflated claims about the 
amount of time spent on FISA warrants and, perhaps most disturbing, exaggerated 
a terrorist threat against the United States.&nbsp; Many members of Congress including 
Senators Rockefeller and Feinstein, publicly criticized Director McConnell ‘s 
overstated claims during the days leading to the passage of the 
PAA</p>
<p>“It would be a huge mistake for Congress to let itself be 
hoodwinked once again by the administration,” said Fredrickson “Members have an 
obligation to uphold the Constitution and Fourth Amendment – especially when 
both are so easily ignored by the executive branch.&nbsp; We urge lawmakers to be wary of the 
administration’s bag of tricks.&nbsp; 
Director McConnell sold members of Congress a lemon in August.&nbsp; Why should they listen to him 
now?”</p>
