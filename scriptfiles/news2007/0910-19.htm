<p>WASHINGTON - September 10 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Inc., is urging California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign a marriage equality bill passed Friday by the state Senate. With a 22-15 vote, the Senate approved AB 43, authored by Assemblymember Mark Leno and sponsored by Equality California (EQCA). The Assembly passed the bill on June 5 with a 42-34 vote. This is the second time in two years that the California Legislature has passed a bill that would give all couples equal access to a marriage license. The governor has until Oct. 14 to act on the bill.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director<br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Inc.</strong></p>

<p align="left">“The California Constitution is clear: Everyone is equal under the law, and that’s just what this bill does — grants equality to all couples. For far too long, too many California families have been placed in harm’s way because they lack the full, fundamental protections they deserve. Governor Schwarzenegger can rectify this inequality by stepping up and signing this bill the moment it lands on his desk.”</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Statement by Thalia Zepatos, Organizing &amp; Training Director<br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Foundation</strong></p>

<p align="left">“One thing is clear — marriage equality is inevitable in this state — it’s only a question of time before the courts, the Legislature and the people of California all unite around this basic principle of equality. We are looking to Governor Schwarzenegger to be a leader and get out in front of where the people are already going.</p>

<p align="left">“We commend the staff and leaders of Equality California, Assemblymember Mark Leno and all the allies and legislators who’ve worked so hard to support this bill.”</p>

<p align="left"><strong><em>About the Task Force’s work in California:</em></strong></p>

<p align="left">Through its partnership with EQCA, the Task Force has been working to build support for the freedom to marry in California. The Task Force has five full-time organizers in California who have helped establish a coalition of more than 45 organizations that support marriage equality. Since 2004, the Task Force has spent more than $500,000 in organizing, training and supporting these efforts.</p>
