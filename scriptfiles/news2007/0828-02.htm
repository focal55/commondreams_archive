<p>WASHINGTON - August 28 -The American Civil Liberties Union today 
said U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales’ resignation requires further 
congressional investigation into the Bush administration’s systematic abuse of 
power. </p><p>“Alberto Gonzales will follow Mitchell Palmer as one of the 
worst attorneys general in U.S. history,” said Anthony D. 
Romero, ACLU Executive Director. “But Gonzales’ resignation doesn’t put an end 
to the widespread abuse of executive powers. The White House may claim that 
Gonzales’ resignation restores the rule of law, but if anything, his departure 
highlights the need for increased scrutiny and accountability.”</p><p>As a matter of policy, the ACLU neither opposes nor endorses 
political appointees. However, even before becoming attorney general, then-White 
House Counsel Alberto Gonzales already demonstrated hostility to civil 
liberties. In January 2005, the ACLU expressed serious concerns about his 
independence and reported on his civil liberties record: </p><p></p><ul><li>He 
disparaged the Geneva Conventions as “quaint” and “obsolete” and developed legal 
arguments that permitted aggressive interrogation tactics in the months after 
9/11, which deny detainees in the war on terror basic legal protections.</li><li>His 
staff created the system by which the president could move American citizens 
from the criminal justice system into detention as enemy combatants, eliminating 
due process protections.</li><li>He 
championed the military tribunal system for detainees in the war on terror that 
omits due process protections granted by the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</li><li>He drafted the infamous Texas clemency memos for then-Governor Bush, which failed to mention key factors in each case, including evidence of innocence that supported clemency for death row inmates.</li></ul><p>During his tenure as attorney 
general, Gonzales championed policies 
that eroded civil liberties protections. 
Among them.</p><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul><li>He 
failed to investigate and prosecute criminal acts committed by civilians in the 
torture or abuse of detainees and repeatedly rebuffed congressional inquiries 
into the matter.<br></li><li>He 
failed to investigate and prosecute criminal acts and violations of laws as a 
result of the National Security Agency’s warrantless spying program. Recent 
reports indicate that Gonzales may have recommended to the president that he 
block the Office of Professional Responsibility’s investigation since he himself 
may have come under scrutiny.<br></li><li>He 
championed renewal of the Patriot Act despite serous civil liberties concerns 
from Republicans and Democrats alike. A recent audit by the Justice Department’s 
Office of the Inspector General found that the FBI underreported, misused and 
abused the National Security Letter authority.<br></li><li>He 
failed to investigate possible perjury committed by Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez 
before the Senate Armed Services Committee. A memo drafted by General Sanchez, 
who commanded the war in Iraq, laid out specific interrogation 
techniques including sleep management, the inducement of fear at two levels of 
severity, loud music and sensory agitation, and the use of canine units to 
exploit fear of dogs. During sworn testimony before Congress, General Sanchez 
flatly denied approving any such techniques.<br></li><li>He 
used Section 218 of the Patriot Act to sidestep the Fourth Amendment by using 
foreign intelligence as a significant purpose to justify searches. The 
investigation of Brandon Mayfield demonstrates how the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act was used to circumvent the Constitution. The FBI arrested 
Mayfield as a material witness in connection with the Madrid train bombing and 
held him for more than two weeks before releasing him. Mayfield was never 
charged, and an FBI internal review later acknowledged serious errors in its 
investigation.<br></li><li>His 
department reversed findings of a team of government voting rights lawyers and 
analysts that concluded a Georgia voter identification law 
would discriminate against minorities.<br></li><li>His 
department attempted to bury an unfavorable report on racial profiling compiled 
by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.<br></li><li>He 
failed to demonstrate necessary independence from the White House and President 
Bush, as evidenced in the recent scandal involving the dismissal of U.S. 
Attorneys. Under Gonzales’ tenure, experienced attorneys in the Civil Rights 
Division of the Justice Department were forced out or replaced by less 
experienced, politically loyal staff. </li></ul><p>“This man, who swore to uphold the Constitution, instead 
flouted it, and consistently put partisan political considerations over the rule 
of law,” said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative 
Office. “He twisted our Constitution and created a legal framework that paved 
the way for tremendous and growing abuses of power by the executive branch. He 
spied on Americans, attempted to justify torture, and worked to strip away our 
most sacred rights and freedoms – all to further the president’s political 
agenda. Congress must not accept Gonzales as the administration’s latest 
sacrificial lamb. Congress must conduct more oversight and restore our 
Constitution, our world status and American values.”</p>
