<p>NEW YORK - November 5 - 			Today, the blogosphere welcomes its newest member with the launch of the <a href="http://www.movementvisionlab.org/" target="_new">Movement Vision Lab</a> (<a href="http://www.movementvisionlab.org/" target="_new">www.movementvisionlab.org</a> <http://www.movementvisionlab.org> ), a ground-breaking new blog that will share and debate visionary ideas for the future.  The Movement Vision Lab is the first-ever portal in cyberspace for grassroots, community leaders across the United States to talk with each other and the public about a positive, alternative vision for the future of our country.
<P></P>
Filling an important hole in blogs to date, the Movement Vision Lab will highlight the ideas and perspectives of community organizers, particularly leaders of color working across the country to achieve change. A participatory blog, visitors to the Movement Vision Lab will also be invited to share their ideas for the future.
<P></P>
“The blogosphere has largely been a space for critique of what’s current. The Movement Vision lab brings hope to this space as we talk about what we want the future to hold,” said Sally Kohn, director of the Movement Vision Lab. “We need more voices with powerful ideas. These amazing leaders bring a different perspective through their on-the-ground action.”
<P></P>
Each week, community leaders working on issues from economic justice to immigrant rights to racial profiling will contribute short essays in response to provocative questions.  The website launches with the question:  What is the future of corporations, unions and the economy?  
<P></P>
The blog will include podcast interviews with prominent progressive leaders, like Service Employees International Union (SEIU) head Andy Stern, who will discuss their ideas for the future. In addition, the Movement Vision Lab has a database of visionary ideas, gathering several hundred resources from organizations nationwide into a searchable database that users can add to, rate and debate.  
<P></P>
“We want a more just and equitable world, but we’re often not clear on the details,” said Deepak Bhargava, executive director, Center for Community Change.  “The Movement Vision Lab will provide a vital space where all of us who want a better future can — together — explore what that future should look like.”  
<P></P>
The Movement Vision Lab is a special project of the Center for Community Change, a 40-year-old national organization that has strengthened the leadership, voice and power of low-income communities nationwide.  The Center confronts the vital issues of today and builds the social movements of tomorrow.
