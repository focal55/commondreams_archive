<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 12 - Outraged
by Senator Lieberman's comments on CBS on Sunday about wanting to bomb
Iran, CODEPINK Women for Peace will hold a sit-in and hunger strike in
the Senator's office to demand that he retract his call for a military
attack on Iran. <br><br>In response to Lieberman's words on CBS, "I think we've got
to be prepared to take aggressive military action against the Iranians
to stop them from killing Americans in Iraq," CODEPINK will sit-in the
Senator's office until they receive a meeting. Leslie Angeline, 50, of
Santa Rosa, CA, a CODEPINK member who upon returning from an Iran peace
delegation, has made it her mission to stop any attack on Iran, will be
sharing photos and stories from her recent trip to Iran. CODEPINK has
also alerted their national membership of 200,000—including thousands
of members in Connecticut—to make calls to Lieberman's office in
support of Leslie's call to stop any attack on Iran.
<br><br>WHEN: Tuesday June 12, 9am until the group receives a meeting with the Senator<br>WHERE: Senator Lieberman's Office- 706 Hart Office Building<br>PHOTO OPPS: Pink visuals, signs, chorus of women in pink singing "Don't Bomb Iran" (Originally performed for 
Sen.McCain <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTEBjPCNBbc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v<wbr>=bTEBjPCNBbc</a>)<br>

"Last night when I heard that Lieberman said he thought we should have
military action against Iran, I decided to start a hunger strike. I
won't eat until Lieberman meets with me. 70% of the Iranian population
is under the age of 30—the age of my son.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iran is a country of warm,
kind, and generous children and their families. We cannot start bombing
these kids," says hunger-striker Leslie Angeline who recently returned
from a Citizen Diplomacy delegation to Iran organized by the
international human rights organization, Global Exchange with CODEPINK.
Upon returning from the trip, Leslie became determined to keep America
from going to war in Iran, and booked her next flight to DC.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>CODEPINK visited the senator's DC office Monday, June 11 with
a coalition of anti-war groups from around the country. The group asked
that they be able to meet with Sen. Lieberman to discuss his comment
but the group was denied a meeting.

<br><br>CODEPINK women and men from around the country will continue
their political pilgrimage to Congressional hearings, member offices
and hallways to demand an end to the illegal US military occupation of
Iraq and any future wars. The group is holding week-long summer
trainings for the next 2 months in DC. Visit <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank" href="../">www.codepinkalert.org</a>
