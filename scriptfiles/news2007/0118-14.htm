<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - League of Women Voters President 


Mary G. Wilson today condemned last night&#8217;s blockage of 
comprehensive ethics reforms by 46 Republican senators. The reform 
package includes vital reforms matching the rule changes passed earlier 
this month in the House that limit the influence of lobbyists and 
require increased transparency on the part of corporate 
contributors.</p>

<p>&#8220;This latest ploy won&#8217;t work,&#8221; said Wilson.&#160; 
&#8220;The American voters were very clear last November &#8211; clean 
up Washington or we will vote you out of office.&#160; Voters expect 
their elected representatives to solve this mess. &#160;They don&#8217;t 


want late night shenanigans that kill ethics reform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The American people are fed up with Congressional scandals. 
They voted to change the status quo&#8212;and last night&#8217;s actions 


under the Capitol dome show just how low the integrity and credibility 
of Congress and its members has sunk. &#8220;</p>

<p>Senate leaders plan to bring the ethics package to another vote later 


today. Last night&#8217;s blockage occurred when lawmakers refused to 
let it pass without a vote on an unrelated measure that would 
essentially grant the President line-item-veto power.</p>

<p>Last month, the League worked closely with lawmakers and other groups 


to support the passage of sweeping ethics rules changes in the House of 
Representatives. In recent weeks, the League has consistently called 
upon the Senate to pass equally strong measures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Senators have a choice to make,&#8221; Wilson concluded. 
&#8220;They can either face the challenge of cleaning up Congress 
head-on, or they can continue to waste the precious time and resources 
of the American people with worthless measures that do nothing to curb 
the rampant greed and corruption that has infected Congress. League 
members and voters across the country urge the honest, ethical members 
of the Senate to show their colleagues the path to restoring integrity 
to the United States Congress.&#8221;</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
