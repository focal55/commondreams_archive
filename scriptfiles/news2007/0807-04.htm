<p>NEW YORK - AUGUST 7 - For the past month, the non-profit group JustForeignPolicy.org has provided
an ongoing estimate of the number of violent Iraqi deaths attributable to the
2003 invasion. Sometime within the next week, their tally is expected to cross
one million Iraqi deaths. (The group will issue a press release when this
occurs.)</p><p>JustForeignPolicy.org's estimate is a rough update of a
scientific study conducted by researchers at Johns
 Hopkins University
last year, which concluded that 601,000 violent Iraqi deaths were attributable
to the invasion as of July 2006. That study, published in <i>The Lancet</i>, relied on a cross-sectional cluster survey, the method
used to estimate deaths around the world following natural and manmade
disasters. For example, the standard press estimate of 200,000 deaths in Darfur
comes from cluster samples conducted by the United Nations and a researcher at Northwestern
 University.</p>





<p>In the absence of a follow-up cluster survey, this careful
extrapolation represents a best estimate of the growing Iraqi death toll.&nbsp;</p>




<p>JustForeignPolicy.org has made available the estimate
available through a frequently updated Web counter, which is viewable here:<br><a href="http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/iraq/iraqdeaths.html" target="_new" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://www.justforeignpolicy<wbr>.org/iraq/iraqdeaths.html</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>To produce the estimate, JustForeignPolicy.org obtains a
rate of how quickly deaths are mounting in Iraq
from the public database maintained by Iraq Body Count (IBC). IBC records all
violent Iraqi civilian deaths reported in at least two English-language press
outlets. That rate is then applied to the more comprehensive estimate of Iraqi
deaths provided by the <i>Lancet</i> study.&nbsp;</p>




<p>A detailed explanation of the methodology behind the
estimate is available here:<br><a href="http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/iraq/counterexplanation.html" target="_new" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://www.justforeignpolicy<wbr>.org/iraq/counterexplanation<wbr>.html</a><br>
