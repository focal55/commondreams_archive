<p>WASHINGTON, DC, March 6  -  Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today called this weekend’s incidents of civilians killed in Afghanistan tragic and urged ISAF to fully assess the incidents and make amends to the families and communities harmed. 
 
<p>On Saturday, the AP reported at least eight civilians killed in a firefight after a minibus ambushed a US convoy near Jalalabad.  According to another AP account the following day nine civilians – four generations in one Afghan family including children – were killed when an ISAF airstrike demolished their mud house.  “As Afghanistan thaws, ISAF is mounting a new front against the Taliban,” said Sarah Holewinski, executive director of CIVIC.  “ With the world and Afghans alike watching how the spring offensive unfolds, NATO forces must now, more than ever, foster goodwill where they work – and that means avoiding civilians and making amends when they are accidentally harmed.” 

<p>CIVIC urged ISAF planners to adequately assess the risk to civilians before targeting Taliban and avoid civilians by all means possible.  CIVIC also called on ISAF leaders to pledge assistance to the surviving family members of those caught in combat operations.
 
<p>“ISAF should immediately help Afghan civilians when tragedy strikes – it’s a show of humanity and is in their best interest to quell the anger rising now among Afghan civilians,” said Holewinski. “Yet NATO countries still have not solidly committed to helping those civilians suffering losses.”   On a recent trip to Kabul, CIVIC received details of a new compensation fund set up by ISAF just before the New Year.  The Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund was created to help civilians immediately following ISAF combat operations.  Still, CIVIC learned that only four of the thirty-six NATO countries have made a contribution to the fund, which does not currently have enough resources to adequately and appropriately respond to civilian harm in combat. 
 
<p><em>CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians killed or injured in conflict should be counted and their families compensated by the warring parties involved, and is working in conflict zones to help the families of war victims.  In 2005, CIVIC's founder Marla Ruzicka was killed in Iraq by a suicide bomb.  CIVIC honors her legacy and strives to sustain her vision.&nbsp;</em><!-- #EndEditable -->
