<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 6 - CCFC is pleased that our Federal Trade Commission complaint caused Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby to make substantive changes to the marketing on their websites. Parents who visit these sites will no longer be subjected to some of these companies’ most deceptive claims about the educational benefits of their videos.

 <P></P>

Nevertheless, we are deeply troubled by the FTC’s decision not to take enforceable action against either company.  This decision tells companies that it is acceptable to lie to parents; and if you get caught you can change your claims with no consequences for years of deception. 

 <P></P>

Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby continue to profit from building their brands on years of false and deceptive marketing that their videos are beneficial for babies. The number one reason parents allow babies to watch DVDs is the mistaken belief that they are educational and/or good for brain development.  Given that, the FTC should have at least compelled both companies to publicly acknowledge that there is no substantiation for claims that these videos have educational or developmental benefits.

 <P></P>

We are no way convinced that either company is committed to ending their deceptive marketing practices. Some of the false claims that have been removed from the companies’ websites continue to appear as product descriptions on the websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com.*    While Brainy Baby dropped the tagline “a little genius in the making,” its new one - “learning for a lifetime” -  is also misleading.  The names Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby continue to send a message that these products are educational.

*For example, Brainy Baby no longer claims on its website that its Peek-A-Boo is a “brain stimulating video [that] helps nurture such important skills as object permanence, communication skills, cause and effect, language development and many others.”  But this claim is still listed in the product description at Amazon.com:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brainy-Baby-Peek-Boo/dp/B0001NXNRI" target="_new">http://www.amazon.com/Brainy-Baby-Peek-Boo/dp/B0001NXNRI</a>. (Accessed December 6, 2007).

 <P></P>

Similarly, while Baby Einstein no longer claims on its own website that Baby Wordsworth “will foster the development of your toddler’s speech and language skills,” this claim is still found at Amazon:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Einstein-Wordsworth-First-Around/dp/B0007Z9QYE" target="_new">http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Einstein-Wordsworth-First-Around/dp/B0007Z9QYE</a>. (Accessed December 7, 2007).
