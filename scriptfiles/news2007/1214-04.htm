<p>WASHINGTON - December 14 --  Amnesty International is seriously concerned that the lifting of the State of Emergency in Pakistan on Saturday, December 15, 2007, will leave the constitution fundamentally flawed and would allow human rights violations to continue unchecked.
<P></P>
Key changes made under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) during the State of Emergency will become permanent, including the removal of key independent judges who have pursued a human rights agenda. The power of Pakistan’s Supreme Court will remain severely weakened, denying it any judicial review over President Pervez Musharraf’s orders or his government’s actions during the emergency.
<P></P>
Amnesty International is demanding that the superior court judges removed from service under the PCO are reinstated and an independent judiciary is allowed to fulfill its critical role in the protection of human rights and the rule of law.
<P></P>
Note to editors:
<P></P>
T. Kumar, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for Asia and the Pacific is available to provide his analysis on the human rights implication in Pakistan.
