<p>  WASHINGTON - September 26– The Co-Chairs of the Progressive Caucus – U.S. Representatives Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) and Barbara Lee (D-CA) – today announced that Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Members have approved an even stronger policy position with regard to U.S. policy in Iraq than when they were the first bloc within this Congress last February to call for all U.S. troops and military contractors to come home.  (See attached formal position statement at <a href="http://cpc.lee.house.gov/" target="_new">http://cpc.lee.house.gov/</a>.)
<p></p>“By more than a two-to-one margin, the American people want to bring our troops and military contractors home and we members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are listening and more determined than ever to accomplish this goal. In adopting this policy statement, Progressive Caucus Members are making clear that we will oppose any bills or amendments brought to the House floor henceforth that pertain specifically to bringing our troops and military contractors
home, but do not include in their text a clear timeline and date certain for the redeployment of U.S. troops and military contractors from Iraq,” Rep. Woolsey underscored.
	<p></p>"As progressives, we are keeping faith with our constituents and a clear majority of the American people who want to end President Bush's failed policy in Iraq and bring our troops home," said Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA).  "Republicans are going to have to decide if they will continue to stand with the President, supporting an open-ended commitment to his failed policy, or with the majority of Americans, who want to bring our brave men and women home."
