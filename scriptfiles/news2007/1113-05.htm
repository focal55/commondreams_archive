<p>LOS ANGELES - November 13 - This week, the Los Angeles Auto Show will kick off to
great eco fanfare as the auto industry rolls out a series of concept
cars in an effort to deflect building criticism from environmental
advocates. Meanwhile, automakers are blocking tougher emissions
standards in the courts, where they are locked in a longstanding legal
fight to block laws passed by California and 11 other states that would
regulate global warming pollution from tailpipe emissions.
<P></P>
Later this week, environmental and human rights advocates will hold a
series of creative actions outside the Los Angeles Convention Center,
calling attention to the wide gap between the auto industry's words and
actions. Members of the Freedom From Oil Campaign will call on
automakers to mass produce pollution-free, petroleum-free vehicles and
will prove the viability of such technologies by performing a one-day,
rapid conversion of a traditional gasoline-electric hybrid to a 100 mpg
plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV).
<P></P>
"The automakers know how to put on a good show, but when the rubber hits
the road, their only real commitment is to keeping the status quo," said
Sarah Connolly of Rainforest Action Network. "With extreme drought and
wildfires in California, oil spills fouling the shores of San Francisco
and the Black Sea, and oil prices approaching $100 a barrel, it is high
time for the automakers to stop saying what they can't do and start
giving American drivers the oil-free, zero-emissions vehicles we want
and deserve.
<P></P>
Increased fuel efficiency will save consumers money at the pump,
increase national security by reducing the nation's reliance on oil, and
help curb global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emission. Automakers
could reach a 40-mpg standard using available technologies to improve
conventional gasoline vehicles, and a 55-mpg standard by making the
majority of their passenger vehicles hybrid-electrics.
<P></P>
"Fuel-efficient cars are the seat belts of the 21st century-necessary
for our families' safety and the survival of our planet," said Nick
Magel of Global Exchange. "If domestic automakers want to survive global
competition and are serious about making environmental commitments, why
not hire engineers to implement the innovative technologies we already
have instead of lawyers to litigate against California's demand for
clean cars?"
<P></P>
The Freedom From Oil Campaign, a coalition of environmental and human
rights advocates organized by Global Exchange, Rainforest Action Network
and Ruckus Society, is working to end America's oil dependence, stop
oil-related conflicts, and curb climate change by convincing the auto
industry to dramatically improve fuel efficiency and eliminate vehicle
greenhouse gas emissions.
