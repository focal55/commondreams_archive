<p>DENVER, COLORADO - December 4 - Today Free Speech TV launched a public campaign urging Internet users to
remember it’s our web, and not the property of large corporations. Find
the launch page at <a href="http://freespeech.org/ourweb" target="_new">http://freespeech.org/ourweb</a>
<p></p>
Free Speech TV is using the “It’s Our Web” Campaign to educate the
public on the dangers of an Internet subjugated by a cartel of
domineering big media corporations. Free Speech TV is also using the
campaign to launch its new non-profit, non-commercial open-source based
social networking community that can be found at
<a href="http://community.freespeech.org/" target="_new">http://community.freespeech.org </a><http://community.freespeech.org/>
<p></p>
The video touches on issues such as online privacy/tracking, centralized
ownership, and copyright, which have been hitting the headlines lately
due to new incursions by big online media conglomerates including the
widely disdained “Facebook Beacon”.
<p></p>
A growing group of bloggers, independent media organizations,
open-source developers, and Internet users have latched onto the video
as a rallying cry for an Internet free of invasive marketing and
advertising.
<p></p>
Free Speech TV Director of Outreach Jason McKain said today: “It’s
exciting to see Internet users from all walks of life sharing and
engaging with this exciting video and campaign. The popularity of video
tells us that there is a prevalent underlying concern with these issues,
and we are happy to provide an alternative for those who choose to get
off websites geared towards manipulating and exploiting its users.”
<p></p>
Steve Anderson the Executive Producer of the "It's Our Web" video said
today: "Suddenly it feels like the Internet is being shaped to satisfy
the demands of advertisers and marketers rather then us, the users. We
need to embrace Internet sites, services and tools that are more
independent of this excessive and unnecessary obstruction to our online
travels. I hope this video serves as a tool for those demanding an
Internet independent of manipulation and privacy violations"
