<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 14 -  Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) called on the House Leadership to give the America people what they were promised a year ago and take America in a new direction in Iraq.<br><br>“When the American people went to the polls last November, they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats. They voted for Democrats because they wanted to see a new direction in Iraq -- and that direction is out,” Kucinich said.<br><br>Today, the House of Representatives approved HR 4156, an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that will provide an additional $50 billion for the Iraq war. This money will be used to keep the United States in Iraq indefinitely. <br><br>“For the past 11 months, all the House Leadership has done is play into President Bush’s hand. They have approved every war funding bill the President has asked for. <br><br>“Leadership could have told President Bush they will not continue to fund the war. They could have said: Use the money you already have to bring the troops home. That is what the American people want.<br><br>“They did not have to bring a bill to the floor. They could have forced the President to bring the troops home by refusing to provide any money for the war. Enough money exists to bring the troops home -- without further appropriations. <br><br>“But by offering the emergency supplemental appropriations bill today, the House Leadership is taking this Congress and this country down the same path: a path of destruction, chaos and death. <br><br>“More than 3,800 Americans have died and more than one million innocent Iraqis have perished in an unjust and unnecessary war. It is commonly accepted that there is no military solution in Iraq, so why are we there?<br><br>“Each year this war is getting more and more costly -- both in the amount of money spent and in the number of lives lost. The Congressional Budget Office released a report last month showing the Iraq war could total $1.9 trillion through 2017 and just yesterday the Joint Economic Committee published a report revealing the total economic costs of war could exceed $3.5 trillion through 2017.<br><br>“When will the House Leadership stand up for the American people? How many more lives have to be lost before they stand up to this Administration and refuse to send any more money for the war?” Kucinich concluded. <br><br>Kucinich introduced <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/thomas" target="_new">HR 1234</a> on February 28, 2007, which is a plan for the United States to use existing money to bring the troops and necessary equipment home and transition to an international security and peacekeeping force. <!-- #EndEditable -->
