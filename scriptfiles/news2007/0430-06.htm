<P></P>MORE INFO:

<P></P>On May Day 2007, National Immigrant  Solidarity Network is calling  for a 
multi-ethnic, decentralized,  multi-topic and multi-tactic national day of 
mobilization to support  immigrant workers rights. Our ten points of  unity:

<P></P>1) No to  anti-immigrant legislation, and the criminalization of  the 
immigrant  communities.<br>
2) No to militarization of the border.<br>
3) No to  the  immigrant detention and deportation.<br>
4) No to the guest worker   program.<br>
5) No to employer sanction and "no match" letters.<br>
6) Yes to  a  path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. <br>
7) Yes to speedy  family  reunification.<br>
8) Yes to civil rights and humane immigration  law.<br>
9) Yes  to labor rights and living wages for all workers.<br>
10)  Yes to the education  and LGBT immigrant legislation.<br>

<P></P>We  acknowledges that there'll be multiple  call to actions from across the  
country to organize May Day 2007, and each  coalition will present their  sets 
of demands. We should respects each other  organizing and encourage  and 
supports everyone's issues:

<P></P>1) Multi-ethnic,  Decentralized and  Multi-topic mobilization: while everyone 
will pledge to  support immigrant  workers rights at May Day 2007, local 
groups can choose to  includes any  other topics for their mobilizations: civil 
rights, anti-war,  Katrina,  labor rights, health care...., etc.

<P></P>2) Decentralized  Multi-Tactic  May Day organizing: We will encourage 
everyone to organize their  actions  at May Day, but will let local groups to decide 
what they want to do at   the day: march, boycott, strike, lunch action, 
vigil, community event,   conference or congressional lobby day, etc.

<P></P>Understanding the   connections between our individual conditions of life and 
the lives of  people  everywhere in the word allows us to come together and 
organize  across all  borders. WE NEED to link the connections between: wars in 
 Africa, south America,  Asia, Iraq, Palestine & Korea with sweatshops  in 
Asia as well as in Los  Angeles, New York; international arm sales and  WTO, 
FTAA, NAFTA & CAFTA with  AIDS, hunger, child labors and child  solider; 
multinational corporations and  economic exploitation with racism  and poverty at 
home--then we can win the  struggle.

<P></P>Let's all come  together, on May Day 2007, to build a new  immigrant rights 
and civil  rights  movements!
