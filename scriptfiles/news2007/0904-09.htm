<p>WASHINGTON - September 4 - Now that Labor Day has passed and the candidates prepare to turn up the heat on their campaigns, The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today released the 2008 Democratic presidential profiles, the environmental community's premiere questionnaire for the 2008 presidential candidates.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>"The Presidential Profiles provide key insights into the candidates' environmental views - and are a key indicator of how they would govern if elected to the White House," LCV President Gene Karpinski said. "This information will give voters the information they need to decide who will be America's first green president."<br>&nbsp;<br>The LCV Presidential Profiles are answers to a questionnaire sent to all the candidates.&nbsp; The questionnaire focuses on priority issues to the environmental and conservation movement, with an emphasis on the twin issues of global warming and energy independence.&nbsp; The Presidential Profiles also include the candidate's plans for their first 100 days in office, as well as the candidates' lifetime LCV scores based on their career environmental voting records.&nbsp; The LCV Presidential Profiles are a widely referenced tool that the public uses as an environmental voter guide.&nbsp; In addition, answers to this important questionnaire play a role in LCV's primary and general election endorsement process.&nbsp; You can view the profiles here: <a href="http://presidentialprofiles2008.org">http://presidentialprofiles2008.org</a><br>&nbsp;<br>Question topics include:<br>&nbsp;<br>- Global&nbsp; Warming and Energy:&nbsp;&nbsp; What&nbsp; are the candidates' positions on mandatory&nbsp; emissions cap on carbon dioxide pollution?&nbsp; Would they increase fuel efficiency&nbsp; standards and support a national renewable electricity standard of 20 percent&nbsp; by 2020? Do they support investments in liquid coal technology?<br>&nbsp;<br>- Public&nbsp; Health:&nbsp; Do they support&nbsp; legislation to reaffirm the scope of the Clean Water Act?<br>&nbsp;<br>- Natural&nbsp; Heritage: What is their position on the Roadless Area Conservation Rule to&nbsp; protect public lands for future generations? Where do they stand on protecting&nbsp; the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?&nbsp;</p>

<p>LCV and its partners believe that American voters are determined, to a greater degree than ever before, to make global warming and energy top issues in 2008. Numerous opinion surveys, as well as the recent volume of news stories, bear this out. Voters will be interested not just in how each candidate plans to respond to these challenges, but also what priority each candidate assigns to them.</p>
<p>This is the first phase of LCV's presidential profiles release, primarily focused on their responses to the questionnaires.&nbsp; LCV will release additional profiles soon, as well as updates to the existing profiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To view LCV's Presidential Profiles, including the candidates' responses to LCV's questionnaire, visit: <a href="http://presidentialprofiles2008.org">http://presidentialprofiles2008.org</a></p>
<p>The nonprofit League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is the independent political voice for the environment.&nbsp; <br>To secure the environmental future of our planet, LCV's mission is to advocate for sound environmental policies<br>&nbsp;and to elect pro-environmental candidates who will adopt and implement such policies.&nbsp; <br>For more information, please visit us on the web at <a href="/newsroom/press-releases/">www.lcv.org</a> &lt;<a href="/">http://www.lcv.org/</a>&gt; . <br>&nbsp;<br>###</p>
