<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 14 -  Green Party leaders called on Congress to repeal recently passed legislation
          expanding the White House's surveillance powers, and urged all Americans concerned about the Bush
          Administration's abuses of power to express their outrage to their Senators and Representatives.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">"Congress should be impeaching President Bush and Vice President Cheney for shredding the US
          Constitution and other high crimes and misdemeanors.  Instead, Republicans and Democrats
          have rewarded Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney for warrantless wiretapping by giving them even
          greater extra-constitutional power," said Sarah 'Echo' Steiner, co-chair of the
          Green Party of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="navigate">The 'Protect America Act of 2007' allows the federal government, without a court-ordered
          warrant or minimal oversights enacted under FISA, to listen in on communications between people
          inside and outside the US.  Greens are demanding immediate repeal of the bill, in advance of its
          six-month expiration.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">"The responsibility for this assault on the Fourth Amendment doesn't only lie with the
          Democrats and Republicans who voted for it.  It also lies with Democrats like Sen. Harry Reid who
          claim to have opposed it, but declined to block the bill with a filibuster," said Carl Romanelli,
          2006 Green candidates for the US Senate in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Greens have accused Democratic leaders of posing as an opposition party while giving President
          Bush a free pass on much of his agenda, especially continued funding for the Iraq war and
          confirmation of extreme right-wing ideologues and operatives for the Supreme Court, Justice
          Department, and other key positions.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Green Party leaders expressed alarm that measures like the surveillance bill and USA Patriot Act,
          in combination with the Bush Administration's loose interpretation of prohibitions against
          torture, use of 'signing statements,' executive order criminalizing antiwar protest
          &lt;<a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2007_07_26.shtml">http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2007_07_26.shtml</a>&gt;,
          and doctrines of unitary executive power, executive privilege, and official secrecy may be
          setting the stage for a greater collapse of US democracy and the rule of
          law.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">"If another attack similar to 9/11 occurs in the US, the White House is already armed with a dozen
          different ways to override the US Constitution, crush dissent, and turn the US into a police
          state," said Kristen Olson, co-chair of the Green Party. "We've already witnessed the breakdown,
          thanks to Republican officials, of fair and accurate elections in Florida in 2000
          and in Ohio and other states in 2004.  It's time for Americans to stand up and defend our freedoms,
          before both Republicans and Democrats abolish them in the name of security and patriotism."&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
