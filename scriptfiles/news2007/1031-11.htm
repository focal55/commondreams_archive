<p>WASHINGTON, DC - October 31 - As the Senate Judiciary Committee met to hear testimony on 
the FISA Amendment Act, the American Civil Liberties Union once again voiced its 
opposition to the proposed legislation and called for strict Fourth Amendment 
protections. The legislation contains some of the same language as the so-called 
Protect America Act, including "basket warrants" that give federal agents the 
power to intercept Americans’ communications without the individual warrants 
that the Fourth Amendment requires. The FISA Amendment Act also includes a 
provision that would grant telecommunications companies immunity for their role 
in the administration’s domestic spying program.</p>
<p>Also today, the American Civil Liberties Union, Move On.org, People For the 
American Way and bloggers from Open Left, Salon, Fire Dog Lake and others 
delivered petitions to Senate and House offices signed by over 250,000 Americans 
who oppose granting amnesty to the telecom companies that violated the Fourth 
Amendment and their privacy.</p>

<p>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</p>
<p>"After months of stonewalling, the administration has dangled a tiny carrot 
in front of Senate Committees in an effort to lure Congress into granting 
immunity for the administration’s partners-in-crime, the telecommunications 
companies. Legal documents were subpoenaed months ago to no avail and, now the 
administration is coughing up just enough to get their pals out of legal 
trouble. We can only assume that these documents implicate the phone companies 
or they wouldn’t need retroactive immunity.</p>
<p>"Between lobbying for telecom immunity, minimizing the involvement of 
the FISA court and invoking the state secrets privilege whenever challenged, the 
administration will effectively cut out any oversight of its domestic 
eavesdropping. This program was exposed nearly two years ago and roundly 
criticized. Now Congress is poised to legalize warrantless surveillance, and let 
the telecommunications companies off the hook to boot. Americans won’t stand for 
cutting deals for criminals." </p><p align="center">To read more about the ACLU’s work on FISA, go to:<br><a href="http://www.aclu.org/fisa/" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.aclu.org/fisa</a>
