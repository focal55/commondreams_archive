<p>WASHINGTON - February 13 - 
<p><b><a href="mailto:milanrai@btinternet.com">MILAN RAI</a></b><br />
Rai wrote a recent briefing paper titled "<a href="http://www.j-n-v.org/pdfs/IED_LIES.pdf">IED Lies: The U.S. claims that Iran supplies Improvised Explosive Devices to Iraqi insurgents. No serious evidence has been provided</a>[<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">PDF</a>]."<br />
<br />
Rai is author of the book <i>7/7: The London Bombings, Islam and the Iraq War</i>.<br />

<b><a href="mailto:zunes@usfca.edu">STEPHEN ZUNES</a></b><br />
Professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, Zunes said today: "Displays of a few bomb fragments hardly prove the Bush administration's contention that 170 Americans [and allies] have been killed with weapons sent by the highest levels of the Iranian government. For one thing, the Iranians back Shiite militias in Iraq allied with the U.S.-backed government, not insurgents attacking American and Iraqi government forces.<br />
<br />
"Secondly, there is a huge black market in various explosive devices, so it would not be surprising to find components from any number of countries. Thirdly, EFPs [explosively formed penetrators] like those shown by U.S. officials have been used by the Irish Republican Army and other insurgent groups for decades and can therefore hardly be treated as a nefarious Iranian invention designed to attack American troops. Even the Iraqi government didn't buy these latest charges by the Bush administration." Zunes is author of the book <i>Tinderbox: U.S. Middle East Policy and the Roots of Terrorism</i> and is Middle East editor for Foreign Policy in Focus.<br />
