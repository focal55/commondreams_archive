<p>WASHINGTON, DC - November 8 - In a debate on Defense spending on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives today, Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) warned against a bunker buster bombing of Iranian nuclear research labs.
<p></p>
“It has been well reported that there is a provision in this bill that will enable the modification of B-2 stealth bombers so that they can drop what is called a ‘bunker buster’ or Massive Ordinance Penetrators (MOP) that would destroy deep underground targets,” Kucinich said.
<p></p>
Kucinich voted against the conference report for Department of Defense FY08 spending because it includes $10 million to convert the 30,000-pound MOP for use on the B-2 bomber.
<p></p>
“Defense analysts have suggested that there is one reason and one reason only why this request was expedited by the Administration and that is retrofit these B-2 bombers so that they’ll be able to drop 30,000-pound bombs on Iranian nuclear research facilities,” Kucinich said.
<p></p>
“We cannot approve the Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report without thinking about the consequences of the Administrations’ approach. If 30,000 pound bombs – bunker busters – are dropped on nuclear research labs, the release of radiation would create a humanitarian and ecological disaster.
<p></p>
“This is a war crime in motion. Dropping the bunker busters would have human health effects that could be catastrophic.
<p></p>
“Congress needs to think about the implications. Congress needs to oppose a strike in Iran. Diplomacy is the preferred path. That is why I am opposing this conference report today.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
