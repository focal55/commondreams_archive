<p>WASHINGTON - October 22 - CODEPINK Women for Peace will hold a press conference at the Canadian Consulate to demand that Canada change its policy of banning peace activists from entering the country if they have committed an act of non-violent civil disobedience. On October 3rd, CODEPINK cofounder Medea Benjamin and Col. Ann Wright were barred from entering Canada because their records for peaceful protests showed up on an FBI criminal database used by Canada. CODEPINK members have gathered approximately 20,000 signatures to protest this outrageous policy and will deliver them to the Consulate on Tuesday. They will also try again to enter Canada on Thursday, October 25, at the invitation of Canadian Members of Parliament.
<p></p>
There will be press conferences outside of Canadian Consulates nationwide in New York, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago on Tuesday to ask the Canadian government to reverse its policy of barring peaceful protesters.
<p></p>
<strong>WHEN:</strong> Tuesday, October 23rd 12pm
PRESS AVAILABILITY WITH MEDEA BENJAMIN
<br>
<strong>WHERE: </strong>In front of Washington, D.C. Canadian Consulate
501 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
<p></p>
"This is outrageous. We are appealing to Canadians not to treat peaceful activists like common criminals. I travel all over the world on a regular basis and Canada is the first country to use the NCIC to keep out people like us," said Medea Benjamin, CODEPINK cofounder.
<p></p>
 BACKGROUND:  On October 3, Ms. Benjamin and Colonel Wright were stopped at the Canadian border and questioned about their participation in anti-war efforts. They were shown copies of FBI files indicating they had been arrested in acts of non-violent civil disobedience. This FBI database was created to assist U.S. law enforcement agencies in finding fugitives, convicted sex offenders, missing persons, and members of terrorist organizations and violent gangs. The database has been enhanced to include convictions for minor offenses related to non-violent protest, and Canada is the only foreign country using this database. Both women were told to apply at a Canadian Consulate for "criminal rehabilitation" --a cumbersome and costly process with a waiting period of 5 years between conviction and application. Instead, together with supportive Parliamentarians, they are challenging the policy.
