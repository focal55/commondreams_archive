<p>BOSTON - October 30 - “Tomorrow’s release of the <i>Manhunt 2</i> epitomizes much of what’s wrong with the videogame industry’s current system of self-regulation.  Research clearly demonstrates that playing violent videogames can increase the likelihood of aggressive behavior in children and youth.  Yet even as the industry claims it wants to keep its most violent games out of the hands of children, it virulently opposes any legislation that would give teeth to its often unenforced guidelines for sales and marketing of M-rated games.  In addition, there is no transparency in the ESRB’s ratings process; no explanation was given why the rating for Manhunt 2 was downgraded from Adults Only to Mature.  A recent review in the New York Times says the resubmitted version “seems to retain at least 99 percent of the original content”.
<p></p>
 

Because of the change in <i>Manhunt 2</i>’s rating, it’s a given that this ultra-violent game will be sold to children. Forty-two percent of underage shoppers in a recent study by the Federal Trade Commission were able to purchase M-rated games.  The ESRB has confirmed that its allegiance is to the industry paying its bills, not to the children it’s supposed to be protecting.”
<p></p>
 

<i>The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is a national coalition of health care professionals, educators, advocacy groups and concerned parents who counter the harmful effects of marketing to children through action, advocacy, education, research, and collaboration among organizations and individuals who care about children.  CCFC supports the rights of children to grow up – and the rights of parents to raise them – without being undermined by rampant commercialism.
