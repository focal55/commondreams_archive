<p>WASHINGTON - September 18 - Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Monday announced that he would veto, for the second time, legislation that would grant same-sex couples the ability to marry in California.
<P></P>
“Equality California calls on the governor to meet with lesbian and gay couples before he acts on this bill so he fully understands the harm he is causing by denying them the dignity, respect and universal recognition that only marriage provides,” said EQCA Executive Director Geoff Kors. “By excluding gay and lesbian couples from marriage, the state of California perpetuates a system that treats one kind of family differently than others. This is the definition of inequality that the governor claims to oppose.  As our elected representatives demonstrated in 2005, and again this year, the people of California believe in fairness and equality. We ask all fair-minded Californians to sign EQCA’s 2007 Marriage Petition, calling on the governor to demonstrate the kind of leadership he has shown on so many other issues.  It is time for the Gov. Schwarzenegger to stand up to out-dated right wing ideology and recognize and honor all California families.”
<P></P>
EQCA is the sponsor of AB 43, the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, which is authored by Assemblymember Mark Leno, D-San Francisco. More than 200 organizations and individuals support the legislation. AB 43 has nearly 200 supporters. A list of AB 43 supporters and EQCA’s 2007 Marriage Petition can be found at <a href="http://eqca.org/" target="_new">eqca.org</a>.
