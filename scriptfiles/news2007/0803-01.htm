<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 3 - Late last night, the U.S Senate passed the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by a vote of 68 to 31. The following is the statement of Kathleen Stoll, Health Policy Director of Families USA:

<P></P>“We commend the strong bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate to reauthorize and expand the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). This is an enormous step forward for children and their health.

<P></P>“This vote is even more commendable because Senators chose to look after the wellbeing of millions of children, especially those children in low-wage working families who can't afford health insurance, despite the President’s shameful veto threat.

<P></P>“We continue to support Congress to do even more for children as the bill moves to conference.”


<P></P>Families USA is the national organization for health care consumers. It is nonprofit and nonpartisan and advocates for high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans.<!-- #EndEditable -->
