<P>NEW YORK - February 5 - The American Civil Liberties Union announced today that it filed a 
new legal complaint challenging the federal government&#8217;s continued exclusion of 
prominent Swiss scholar Tariq Ramadan. The complaint also challenges the Patriot 
Act&#8217;s &#8220;ideological exclusion&#8221; provision, which authorizes the government to deny 
visas to foreign citizens on the basis of their political views. </P>
<P>&#8220;The government is excluding Professor Ramadan from the United States not 
because he is a threat to national security but because of his politics, and 
that has been clear since the government first revoked Professor Ramadan&#8217;s visa 
in 2004,&#8221; said Jameel Jaffer, Deputy Director of the ACLU&#8217;s National Security 
Program and lead counsel in the case. &#8220;The government is using the immigration 
laws as a means of censoring academic and political debate inside the United 
States.&#8221;</P>
<P>The new complaint comes in a lawsuit filed in January 2006 by the ACLU and New York 
Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the American Academy of Religion, the 
American Association of University Professors and PEN American Center, who say 
that the government is preventing their members from meeting with Ramadan and 
from hearing constitutionally protected speech. Ramadan was set to teach at the 
University of Notre Dame in 2004 until the government barred him from 
re-entering the United States by invoking the Patriot Act&#8217;s &#8220;ideological 
exclusion&#8221; provision, which applies to those who have &#8220;endorsed or espoused&#8221; 
terrorism. When challenged in court, government attorneys failed to produce any 
evidence showing that Ramadan had endorsed terrorism, and during the course of 
litigation they abandoned the allegation altogether. </P>
<P>In June 2006, U.S. District Court Judge Paul A. Crotty ordered the government 
to stop stonewalling and either grant Ramadan a visa or explain why it would not 
do so. The court also issued a ruling stating that the government cannot bar 
non-citizens from the United States simply because of their political views. 
</P>
<P>After more than two years of investigating Ramadan and faced with a deadline 
imposed by the court, in September 2006 the State Department offered a new 
pretext for excluding Ramadan: that he had donated about 600 Euros between 1998 
and 2002 to French and Swiss organizations that provide humanitarian aid to 
Palestinians - information Ramadan voluntarily gave to the State Department 
several months prior. Although the organizations are legitimate charities in 
Europe, in 2003 the Bush administration added the groups to a blacklist because 
they allegedly provide &#8220;material support&#8221; to Hamas. In the amended complaint, 
which was filed late Friday, the ACLU argues that the donations were not a basis 
for inadmissibility at the time they were made and the current material support 
provision cannot be applied retroactively. </P>
<P>In recent months, the government has excluded numerous writers, scholars and 
activists for reasons that appear to be ideological, said the ACLU. In October 
2006, South African professor Adam Habib, a prominent anti-war activist, was 
prevented from coming to the United States to meet with scholars in New York, 
the National Institute of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and the World Bank. In February 2006, Dr. Waskar Ari, a Bolivian historian and 
outspoken advocate for the rights of indigenous people in Latin America, was 
prevented from taking a faculty post at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln 
because the government revoked his visa and refused to act on his pending 
application. Likewise, John Milios, a Greek professor of Marxist economic 
theory, and Basque historian and activist I&#241;aki Ega&#241;a, were both excluded in 
June 2006. </P>
<P>&#8220;Academic discourse relies on an open exchange of diverse ideas but that 
vital exchange is thwarted when the government prevents foreign scholars from 
coming to the United States to speak with American audiences,&#8221; said ACLU 
attorney Melissa Goodman. &#8220;By banning foreign scholars, the government is 
sending the message that America is afraid of critical thought.&#8221; </P>
<P>In addition to Jaffer and Goodman, attorneys in the Ramadan case are Judy 
Rabinovitz and Lucas Guttentag of the ACLU, Arthur Eisenberg of the NYCLU, and 
New York immigration lawyer Claudia Slovinsky. The lawsuit was brought against 
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Secretary of 
State Condoleezza Rice.</P>
