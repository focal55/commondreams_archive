<p>WASHINGTON - March 20 - 
<p>JOHN STAUBER, SHELDON RAMPTON, <a href="mailto:john@prwatch.org">john@prwatch.org</a>, 
<a href="http://www.prwatch.org/node/5865" target="_new">http://www.prwatch.org/node/5865</a>
<p>    Stauber and Rampton co-wrote the recent article "Why Won't MoveOn 
Move Forward?" which states: "MoveOn's organizing around Iraq has become 
notably ambiguous lately. Although it talks in general terms about 
bringing the troops home, specific timetables or meaningful steps in 
that direction are nowhere discussed. Most strikingly, MoveOn has 
adamantly refused to support the Iraq amendment from Congressional 
Progressive Caucus leaders Barbara Lee, Lynn Woolsey and Maxine Waters, 
which calls for 'a fully funded, and systematic, withdrawal of U.S. 
soldiers and military contractors from Iraq' by the end of 2007. ...
<p>    "The Pelosi bill merely establishes 'benchmarks' of progress in 
Iraq, so that all Bush has to do is certify that he is making progress 
on those goals to keep funding flowing for the war."
<p>    Stauber is executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy 
and is co-author with Rampton of "Weapons of Mass Deception" and "The 
Best War Ever."

<p> Abramsky, Morris and Zeese are Maryland residents associated with 
local peace groups. This afternoon, they are involved in an "occupation" 
of U.S. Representative Chris Van Hollen's D.C. office in coordination 
with the national campaign the Occupation Project, a nonviolent effort 
to defund the Iraq war.

</a>
<p>   Abramsky said today: "Since the Democrats took control of Congress, 
214 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq. As each day goes by, close to 
three U.S. troops die in Iraq. Hundreds are wounded each month. This 
means during the next year and a half another 1,600 will die and tens of 
thousands more will be injured. Iraqi casualties will be over one 
hundred-fold greater than those of the U.S."
<p>    Added Morris: "Continuing the U.S. presence in Iraq gains us 
nothing. The U.S. occupation is the single biggest impediment to an 
Iraqi-led ceasefire."
<p>    Zeese -- who is director of DemocracyRising.US -- recently wrote a 
piece titled "The 'Democratic Supplemental' Fails to Deal with Iran and 
Has Big Loopholes That Will Leave Tens of Thousands or More Troops in 
Iraq" which states: "The headline that the Democratic leadership would 
like voters to hear is 'troops out of Iraq by August 2008.' But the 
headline is more a wolf in sheep's clothing than a reality. ...
<p>    "For most in the peace movement an August 2008 deadline for 
withdrawal is already way too slow. Why the delay? On November 17, 2005, 
Rep. Jack Murtha called for redeployment within six months. Here we are 
16 months later and the Democratic leadership is talking about 
redeployment in 17 months. Six months has turned into 33 months -- and 
in fact the August [2008] deadline is illusory. ..."
