<p>NEW ORLEANS - January 19 -  <P>On Monday, Jan. 22, NOW will hold its annual candlelight vigil in 
            the shadow of the U.S. Supreme Court, commemorating the 34th 
            anniversary of the landmark <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM> decision affirming 
            women's constitutional right to abortion. </P>
            <P>"Just across from the Supreme Court stands the Capitol, where the 
            legislative branch of our government is under new leadership. The 
            promise of a new Congress is heartening, but we cannot let our guard 
            down. We must continue to be vigilant about upholding a woman's 
            right to make her own childbearing decisions, including access to 
            birth control and abortion," said NOW President Kim Gandy. </P>
            <P>NOW and its allies will join together on Jan. 22, to stand 
            steadfast in support of the constitutional right that has protected 
            women's privacy and rights for 34 years. </P>

            <P>"Many states across the country are considering abortion bans 
            like the one South Dakota passed last year&#8212;dangerous bans that no 
            doubt will be challenged and possibly argued before the Supreme 
            Court. With two new justices whose decisions could overturn Roe, and 
            the Hyde Amendment federal funding ban still in place that limits 
            poor women's access to abortion, we will remind the nation that 
            reproductive health, rights and justice hang in the balance," said 
            Gandy.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
