<p> JENA, LA - September 14 -The American Civil Liberties Union today 
expressed concern about the possibility of racially-motivated unequal treatment 
in the Jena Six case, in which six black high school students were charged with 
attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder for fighting with a white 
student last year in Jena, 
Louisiana. Although some of the charges were 
later reduced to aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery, 
one student still faces an attempted murder charge and up to 50 years in prison 
without suspension, probation or parole. Mychal Bell, the only member of the 
Jena Six to be tried so far, was convicted of aggravated battery in July and 
could face a 15 year prison sentence. </p>

<p>The troubling story began 
in August 2006, when three black Jena 
High School students sat under a 
so-called "white tree" in the school’s courtyard where only white students 
traditionally sat. When they arrived at school the next morning, the black 
students found three nooses hanging from the tree. In the weeks following this 
incident, racial altercations engulfed the town of 
Jena. Under questionable 
circumstances, LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters charged six black 
teenagers with attempted murder. Only one white student was charged for his 
involvement in the fights—a minor charge of battery that put him on 
probation.</p>
<p>"Given the facts as 
reported, the Jena Six case raises serious questions about a possible double 
standard for whites and blacks in the criminal justice system—and in our 
schools. Unfortunately, this kind of problem is not exclusive to 
Jena, 
Louisiana," said Dennis Parker, Director of 
the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program. "Possible differences in treatment between 
students of different races, the apparent overcharging of students by law 
enforcement and questions about the possibility of discrimination generally in 
the school are emblematic of the "school-to-prison pipeline" cases that we are 
seeing nationwide."</p>
<p>The ACLU has been on the 
ground working closely with the families of the Jena Six since March 2007, 
before their story was reported nationally. As a lead advocacy organization on 
the issue, the ACLU has helped the families of the six young men charged in the 
Jena Six cases to form a defense committee and to develop and administer a legal 
defense fund to ensure qualified criminal defense representation. In addition, 
the ACLU has thoroughly monitored the cases to protect the civil rights of the 
Jena Six and their families.</p>
<p>"From racial profiling to 
unequal punishment in school to potential misconduct by authorities, the Jena 
Six case causes great concern," said Marjorie Esman, Executive Director of the 
ACLU of Louisiana. "It is time to fully examine the facts surrounding this case 
to determine if any racially-motivated misdeeds have taken place. Considering 
the concerns that the Jena Six bring up, we must redouble our commitment to 
equal protection—not just in Jena, 
but across Louisiana and the rest 
of the country."</p>
<p>Recently, the ACLU of 
Louisiana filed an "open records request" in 
Louisiana seeking all arrest and 
incident reports, broken down by race, for LaSalle Parish, which includes the 
town of Jena. The request also seeks 
records pertaining to Jena 
High School specifically, including 
documents listing the frequency of law enforcement visits to the school and 
charges issued to its students. Instead of following the standard procedure of 
turning over the appropriate materials, District Attorney Walters took the 
extraordinary step of suing the ACLU of Louisiana in state court so he would not 
have to comply with the order. The ACLU of Louisiana filed a motion to move the 
issue to federal court, where it is currently pending. </p>
<p>Coinciding with Mychal 
Bell’s September 20 sentencing date, the ACLU is working in 
coordination with the Jena Six family members to organize a demonstration from 
the courthouse to a baseball field in 
Jena. The event is expected to draw 
up to 5,000 people from across the country in support of the Jena Six and to 
bring attention to their tragic experience.</p>
<p>In light of media reports 
of questionable conduct by authorities involved in the Jena Six cases, the ACLU 
is calling on Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti to seek justice for the 
Jena Six—including a thorough examination of the actions of District Attorney 
Reed Waters to determine whether or not prosecutorial improprieties have taken 
place.</p>
