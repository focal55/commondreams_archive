<p>WASHINGTON - February 27 - U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Susan 
          Collins (R-ME) have introduced legislation to reauthorize the Automated 
          Defibrillators in Adam's Memory Act, or the ADAM Act. The bill is modeled 
          after the successful Project ADAM that originally began in Wisconsin, 
          and establishes a national clearing house to help schools set up public 
          programs that provide access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs). 
          The ADAM Act, originally introduced by Feingold and Collins, became 
          law in 2003. This effort is part of Feingold&#8217;s &#8220;Health Care 
          Week&#8221; to help address health care issues facing Wisconsin communities.
<p>&#8220;Congress should fund this important program so more schools 
          and communities across the country are prepared if tragedy strikes,&#8221; 
          Feingold said. &#8220;Project ADAM has been greatly successful in preparing 
          Wisconsin communities and we should be doing what we can to spread information 
          about the importance of defibrillators in schools nationwide.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Although sudden cardiac deaths occur more commonly in adults, each 
          year an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 children across the country die suddenly 
          without exhibiting previous symptoms. The ADAM Act is designed to help 
          schools with technical guidance, appropriate training, fund-raising 
          techniques, and other logistics required for successful programs. The 
          ADAM Act was inspired by Adam Lemel, a 17-year-old high school student 
          from Wisconsin who collapsed and died from an undiagnosed heart condition 
          while playing in a junior varsity basketball game.</p>
        <p>&#8220;Sudden cardiac arrest takes nearly 325,000 lives annually,&#8221; 
          Feingold said. &#8220;The more we can do to educate schools on how to 
          obtain and operate defibrillators, the more lives we can save.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Feingold and Collins have also worked on another initiative to empower 
          communities and improve cardiac arrest survival rates. In 2002, the 
          Senators introduced and helped pass into law the Rural Access to Emergency 
          Devices Act, which allows community partnerships across the country 
          to receive a grant enabling them to purchase defibrillators, and receive 
          the training needed to use these devices. Currently, the program has 
          funded nearly $45 million in grants to help save lives in rural areas 
          by providing AEDs. </p>
