<p>ARVADA, Colo. &#8211; March 12 &#8211;&nbsp;Martin Sheen, Larry Hagman, Desmond Tutu and several other celebrities launched a <a href="http://www.refundsforgood.org">"Refunds for Good"</a> campaign today to benefit the PeaceJam Foundation and two other leading non-profit organizations. "We've scoured the planet for some of the most compelling charities around," Sheen said. "This is a unique, one-time opportunity to help the planet and to make a powerful statement at the same time." 

<p>The mission of the PeaceJam Foundation is to create a new generation of young leaders committed to positive change in themselves, their communities, and the world through the inspiration of Nobel Peace Laureates. Since its inception in 1996, more than 500,000 youth have participated in the PeaceJam program. Over 300,000 service projects have been created and implemented by participating youth, and over 130 PeaceJam youth events have taken place in 10 different countries around the world.

<p>Sheen explained that, "The IRS owes the American public approximately $20 billion from an illegal 'War Tax' that has been around for over 108 years. I didn't know this, maybe you didn't know this; now, we both know this, and you will see this refund opportunity on your tax returns this season. I just want to encourage you to use this one-time refund to support one of the excellent non-profit organizations on this website." 

<p>"PeaceJam was selected because the Refunds for Good founders were inspired by the breadth and scope of the Global Call to Action and by the idea of Nobel Peace Laureates and teenagers taking on the biggest and toughest problems facing the world today," said Dawn Engle, Executive Director of the PeaceJam Foundation.

<p>In September of 2006, the PeaceJam Foundation hosted the largest gathering of Nobel Peace Laureates in US history, and launched a 10 year "Global Call to Action" addressing 10 of the most vexing problems facing the planet today. The Nobel Peace Laureates hope to inspire 1 billion "Global Action" projects worldwide by the year 2016.

<p>The Daily Show's Nate Corddry added his support to "Refunds for Good," saying that "International violence, global warming -- these are daunting challenges that we all face, but there is a solution." Larry Hagman said "I encourage you to use your refund to help the world", and Ed Begley Jr., urged, "It will only take a brief moment, but the impact your contribution will have on the world will be huge." 

<p>Archbishop Desmond Tutu encouraged support for the PeaceJam Foundation, and described the powerful work of this international education foundation. "It has gained an incredible kind of momentum and has made a huge, huge difference in the lives of many young people in giving them hope and direction," he said. 

<p>Due to five recent court rulings, $10 billion is owed by the IRS to American businesses, and another $10 billion to individual citizens. This refund is only being offered during this current tax season. The average individual refund will be between $30 to $60, and businesses could be eligible for potentially tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

<p>The "Refunds for Good" website was created to address this historic opportunity, and to make it easier for the American people to learn about this court-mandated refund. 

<p>As reported in the New York Times on February 11, 2007, the tax has a colorful past. It was first imposed in 1898, on calls costing 15 cents or more, to finance the Spanish-American War. 

<p> "This may be the one and only time that you personally can direct your tax dollars away from funding war and toward helping humanity," said PeaceJam President, Ivan Suvanjieff.  

<p>The two other non-profit organizations highlighted on the "Refunds for Good" website are the Solar Electric Light Fund and Physicians for Social Responsibility.
