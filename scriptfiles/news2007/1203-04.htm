<p>WASHINGTON - December 3 - Today, Media Matters for America released the following statement in response to nationally syndicated radio host Don Imus’ scheduled return to the airwaves this morning on Citadel Radio and RFD-TV, which will simulcast his program.

 <P></P>

“Don Imus has an opportunity to show the American people that he has learned from his experience -- that the bigoted insults he once leveled on a regular basis have no place on the public’s airwaves and do nothing to raise the level of discourse in this country,” said Karl Frisch, spokesman for Media Matters. “We will continue monitoring his broadcasts as we have done for years.”

  <P></P>

As first noted by Media Matters, on the April 4 edition of MSNBC's Imus in the Morning, Imus referred to the Rutgers University women's basketball team, which was comprised of eight African-American and two white players, as “nappy-headed hos” immediately after the show's executive producer, Bernard McGuirk, called the team “hard-core hos.” On April 12, following MSNBC's announcement the previous day that it would no longer air simulcasts of the Imus in the Morning radio show, CBS -- which owned both the show's home radio station and the show's syndicator, Westwood One -- announced it would cease broadcasting Imus in the Morning as well.
