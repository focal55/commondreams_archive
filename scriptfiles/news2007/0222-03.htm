<p>WASHINGTON - February 22 - Federal Communications Commissioners Jonathan Adelstein, Michael Copps and Robert McDowell will visit Columbus, Ohio, on March 7 to listen to local residents' concerns about media consolidation. This "Town Meeting on the Future of Media" is a rare opportunity for the public to participate directly in crafting media policies that serve their community.<BR><BR><b>WHAT:</b> Town Meeting on the Future of Media<BR><BR><b>WHEN:</b> Wednesday, March 7, 5:30 p.m.<BR><BR><b>WHERE:</b> Broad Street Presbyterian Church, 760 E. Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio<BR><BR><b>WHO:</b> FCC Commissioners Jonathan Adelstein, Michael Copps and Robert McDowell, local leaders and media representatives, concerned citizens.<BR><BR>The Town Meeting on the Future of Media is taking place as the FCC reviews longstanding media ownership rules, including the longstanding limits on the number of television and radio stations one company can own in one area and the prohibition on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership &mdash; which prevents companies from owning a television or radio station and the major daily newspaper in most markets.<BR><BR>"Communities across the country and people of all political stripes are feeling the impact of media that have gotten too big and lost touch with their audience," said Josh Silver, executive director of Free Press. "This situation will only get worse if the remaining limits on local ownership are gutted by the FCC. This forum will give citizens in Ohio a chance to participate directly in the debate over the future of media ownership."<BR><BR>The Columbus meeting is being sponsored by Free Press, Consumers Union, Common Cause Ohio, United Church of Christ Office of Communications, Inc., Columbus Metropolitan Area Church Council, Ohio PIRG, Ohio Citizen Action and Media Bridges.<BR><BR>"When people want to know what happened at the latest City Council meeting or when the next school board meeting is, they turn to their local television stations and newspapers," said Joel Kelsey, grassroots coordinator for Consumers Union. "These are by far the most dominant sources of local news and information. By lifting the ban on cross-ownership of television stations and major daily newspapers, the FCC would be allowing the two most competitive sources of local news to merge. Weakening ownership caps undermines any remaining benefits of local competition, limits consumer choice and will make it much harder for localism and diversity to thrive in American media."<BR><BR>"If Ohioans lose access to views and news, media moguls may grow richer but our democracy will be poorer," said Jack Noragon, board chair of Common Cause Ohio. "America's democracy works best when citizens have access to a wide diversity of views and plenty of local news. These are two of our nation's most important media policy goals."<BR><BR>The free forum will include an open microphone session for the public to offer testimony on media issues to Commissioners Adelstein, Copps and McDowell. All testimony will be recorded and submitted to the FCC and Ohio's elected officials.<BR><BR>"Consolidation of the media has virtually wiped out Ohio's local voices," said Maggie Abbulone of Ohio PIRG. "Ohio faces unique local issues requiring local attention and local solutions. We need strong rules that give consumers more choices on the public airwaves to make our media system one that works, first and foremost, for the public good."<BR><BR>For more information on the Town Meeting on the Future of Media, please visit: <A HREF="http://www.freepress.net/future/=columbus">http://www.freepress.net/future/=columbus</A>.</p>
