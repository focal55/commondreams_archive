<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - Tom Andrews, National Director of Win Without War and a former Congressman from Maine, issued the following statement today on Michael Mukasey's nomination for Attorney General:

 
<P></P>
"The Senate should reject Michael Mukasey's confirmation for Attorney General.  His testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is not sure whether waterboarding is legal or illegal should disqualify him as the top law enforcement officer of the United States.

 
<P></P>
We need an Attorney General who is willing and able to tell the truth – waterboarding is torture. We prosecuted Japanese officers for using it against our soldiers in World War II.  Last year, Congress passed a law, the Detainee Treatment Act, signed by President Bush, which specifically prohibits the use of waterboarding in military interrogations. 

 <P></P>

What Mr. Mukasey is saying is that he thinks it's too politically inconvenient to call this practice what it is.  That is not an acceptable position for someone who would be Attorney General of the United States to take.  Torture is torture, no matter who does it.  The Attorney General needs to understand that no one in this country is above the law.
<P></P>
 

Mukasey said that he did not want to put U.S. officials 'in personal legal jeopardy.'  Well, what about the life and death hexapody that such an abhorrent practice puts those servicemen and women who we put into harm's way? This practice subjects any of them who are captured to the same treatment. The Attorney General must be the chief law enforcement officer for the entire country, not the attorney for US officials. He or she must be committed to enforcing the law, not carving out exceptions to it.

 <P></P>

President Bush attempted to defend Mukasey by saying that he doesn't know whether or not the US uses waterboarding. If President Bush knows that Americans are breaking the law, he needs to say so, and he needs to do everything in his power to make it stop. But Mukasey doesn't have to know whether the US is using waterboarding – all he needs to know is that waterboarding is torture and is against the law.

 <P></P>

Mr. Mukasey's statements are one more mark against America internationally.  He has already helped undermine our moral standing in the world.  America should be symbolized by the statue of liberty and the bill of rights, not by Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo.
<P></P>
 

The Senate has an obligation to remove this stain and restore America's standing in the world.  It is a crucial test for Democrats and Republicans of conscience: will they condemn the barbaric practice of waterboarding, and all who defend it?  The Win Without War coalition is mobilizing its members to call and write to their Senators to express their outrage."<!-- #EndEditable -->
