<p>WASHINGTON - May 14 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said the organization is the first political pro-choice group to provide statements from presidential candidates on where they stand on women's freedom and privacy. </p>

<p>"NARAL Pro-Choice America is committed to letting voters know where presidential candidates stand on a woman's right to choose," Keenan said.&nbsp; "The 2008 elections are about protecting and electing pro-choice candidates.&nbsp; We must protect the gains we made in the 2006 midterm congressional elections and elect more pro-choice candidates, beginning with a pro-choice president.&nbsp; Voters want a president who will demonstrate clear and consistent leadership in protecting America's pro-choice values."</p>
<p>In addition to the candidates' statements, NARAL Pro-Choice America's site includes a summary of candidates' congressional voting records (where relevant) and a selection of public statements from all candidates on the issue of choice.&nbsp; The site also features candidates who declined to provide a written statement.&nbsp; NARAL Pro-Choice America will share this information with more than one million of its member-activists in all 50 states.</p>
<p>"The U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold Bush's Federal Abortion Ban only reiterates the importance of electing a pro-choice president," Keenan said.&nbsp; "Americans are tired of Bush-like divisive attacks on a woman's right to choose.&nbsp; They want leaders to stand up against political interference in our most personal, private medical decisions."</p>
