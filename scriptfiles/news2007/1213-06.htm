<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 13 -- <strong>League of  Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski issued this statement  regarding the Senate’s failure to invoke cloture on the Energy Independence and Security Act: </strong>
<p></p>
    “A minority of the U.S. Senate today gave a holiday gift to Big Oil and once again, the American people get an  undeserved lump of coal.
     <p></p>
    “At a time when the oil industry is getting fat on near-$100 per barrel oil and record profits, a minority of  senators sided with big oil and big coal to block a measure that is good  for jobs, good for the economy, good for national security, good for the  consumer and good for the planet. They did so in order to protect tax  giveaways to big oil – supporting dirty energy of the past at a time when the American people are demanding we invest in the clean, renewable energy of the future.
     <p></p>
    A majority of 59 senators voted for moving forward on the bill, which would increase fuel efficiency for automobiles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 and repeal billions of dollars of subsidies  for oil companies. But we needed one more vote today.
     <p></p>
    Today’s vote underscores the urgent need to elect more pro-environment senators  who will fight for our energy future and not continue to subsidize the  richest special interests in the  world.”
