<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 20 - Today, David Brock, President and CEO of <i>Media Matters for America</i>, sent a letter 
to Steve Capus, president of NBC News, sparked by a report that NBC chief 
Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski accepted $30,000 from the Greater 
Providence Chamber of Commerce to address its Business EXPO 2007 -- an event at 
which Miklaszewski attacked presidential candidate and former Sen. John Edwards 
(D-NC), calling him a "loser" for defending a pricey haircut.</p>

<p>The letter asks Capus to make public NBC's 
policy pertaining to journalists participating in paid speaking engagements and 
to explain whether Mr. Miklaszewski violated that 
policy.</p>

<p>In 2002, <i>Washington Post</i> media critic Howard Kurtz 
reported that professional journalists' accepting speaking fees is widely 
frowned upon by the media, and that a "number of news organizations including 
ABC and NBC, [have] banned the practice."  </p>

<p>In 2006, responding to controversy 
surrounding Chris Matthews' acceptance of speaking fees from several corporate 
interests, then-MSNBC president Rick Kaplan clarified publicly that NBC has a 
strict policy prohibiting anchors from personally accepting speaking fees, and 
that anyone who did so "would risk being fired."</p>

<p><b>Excerpts from the 
letter:</b></p>

<p>"We recently learned that earlier this 
spring NBC News chief Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski accepted $30,000 
from the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce to address its Business EXPO 
2007 -- an apparent violation of NBC News' policy banning paid speaking 
engagements."</p>

<p>"Equally troubling, during his remarks 
Miklaszewski cast aspersions on presidential candidate and former Senator John 
Edwards (D-NC), calling him a 'loser' for defending a pricey haircut." 
</p>

<p>"As we have noted, Mr. Miklaszewski's 
remarks appear to be in direct violation of your network's ban on paid speaking 
engagements. I respectfully ask that you publicly release NBC's ethics and 
conflict-of-interest policies for journalists, and explain whether Mr. 
Miklaszewski's conduct comports with those 
policies."</p>

<p><b>Full text of the letter:</b> 
</p>

<p>July 19, 2007<br>Mr. Steve Capus<br>President, NBC News<br>NBC Television Group<br>30 Rockefeller 
Plaza<br>New 
York, NY 
10112-0037 

</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Capus, 
</p>

<p>We recently learned that earlier this 
spring NBC News chief Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski accepted $30,000 
from the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce to address its Business EXPO 
2007 -- an apparent violation of NBC News' policy banning paid speaking 
engagements.</p>

<p>Equally troubling, during his remarks 
Miklaszewski cast aspersions on presidential candidate and former Senator John 
Edwards (D-NC), calling him a "loser" for defending a pricey haircut. While this 
personal attack is not the chief reason for writing this letter, it is clearly 
inappropriate for a professional, impartial journalist to make and deserves your 
direct attention as well.</p>

<p>In 2002, <i>Washington Post</i> media critic Howard Kurtz 
reported that professional journalists' accepting speaking fees is widely 
frowned upon by the media, and that a "number of news organizations including 
ABC and NBC, [have] banned the practice."  </p>

<p>In 2006, responding to controversy 
surrounding Chris Matthews' acceptance of speaking fees from several corporate 
interests, then-MSNBC president Rick Kaplan clarified publicly that NBC has a 
strict policy prohibiting anchors from personally accepting speaking fees, and 
that anyone who did so "would risk being fired."</p>

<p>As we have noted, Mr. Miklaszewski's 
remarks appear to be in direct violation of your network's ban on paid speaking 
engagements. I respectfully ask that you publicly release NBC's ethics and 
conflict-of-interest policies for journalists, and explain whether Mr. 
Miklaszewski's conduct comports with those policies. If Mr. Miklaszewski's 
decision to give a speech paid for by a special interest group in which he 
attacked a presidential candidate is consistent with NBC's policies, I ask that 
you revise those policies to prohibit such actions.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>David Brock<br>President &amp; 
CEO<br><i>Media Matters for 
America</i></div>
