<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 17 -- Today, in light of another year rife with corruption, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released a new report on the Top Ten Ethics Scandals of 2007. It is available in its entirety at www.citizensforethics.org.</p>
<p>There is no ranking of these egregious activities, rather the following list outlines CREW’s new annual study on the past year’s on-going scandals:</p>
<p><b>No new enforcement mechanisms for congressional ethics;</b></p>
<p><b>Ted Stevens still sitting on Senate Appropriations;</b></p>

<p><b>Senate Ethics Committee looking into Sen. Craig, but not Sen. Vitter;</b></p>
<p><b>Millions of missing White House emails still unaccounted for;</b></p>
<p><b>Rep. Murtha’s abuse of the earmarking process remains unchecked;</b></p>
<p><b>Lurita Doan remains chief of GSA despite illegal conduct;		</b></p>
<p><b>White House covering up its role in the firings of the U.S. Attorneys;</b></p>
<p><b>No Child Left Behind funds directed to Bush fundraisers who provide inadequate reading materials for kids;</b></p>
<p><b>Court decision regarding search of Jefferson’s office limits ability of DOJ to investigate other corrupt lawmakers; and			</b></p>
<p><b>FEMA knowingly let Katrina victims live in hazardous trailers	</b></p>
<p>Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said today, “This past year was filled with unethical, illegal and just plain outrageous behavior by public officials. We hope by calling attention to these scandals, government officials will take responsibility -- or at least, be held accountable --  for their conduct.”
