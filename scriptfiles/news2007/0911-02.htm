WASHINGTON - September 11 - The National Association of Broadcasters has announced its intention to derail efforts to use valuable but unused broadcast airwaves — known as ‘white spaces’ — for unlicensed, wireless broadband. Free Press Policy Director Ben Scott issued the following statement:
<P></P>
“The National Association of Broadcasters is engaged in a campaign of misinformation to persuade Congress and regulators to ignore the innovative potential that unused public airwaves hold — blocking a valuable opportunity to connect tens of millions of Americans to an affordable Internet.
<P></P>
“Every market in the country has set aside unused public airwaves for broadcast television. In some communities, more than three-quarters of these ‘white spaces’ are vacant. These empty spaces on the public spectrum represent an enormous public resource that could be used by other communications services. The social and economic benefits of utilizing these unused airwaves far outweigh the shortsighted fears of the broadcast industry.
<P></P>
“But through false assumptions and twisted facts, the NAB is attempting to collapse the entire white spaces debate into a single test of prototype devices at the FCC. In reality, the recent round of tests is a part of a process to use technology to maximize the public benefit derived from publicly owned airwaves. One part of this test actually demonstrated the viability of the smart sensing technology utilized by White Spaces Devices. With the proper testing and certification, the FCC will ensure that mobile wireless devices and television broadcast stations smoothly co-exist on the public airwaves.
<P></P>
“By misleading the public on the white spaces issue, the NAB will only further the digital divide. Congress should look upon the FCC tests as a part of the process that brings the right public policy outcome — the unlicensed use of empty airwaves for universal, affordable Internet access.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
