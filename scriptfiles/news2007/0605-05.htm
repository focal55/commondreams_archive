<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 5 - Ken Boehm, Chairman of
the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), today made the following
statement regarding the indictment of Rep. William Jefferson (D-LA):
    <P></P>"These indictments are no surprise. They are long in coming. There is
no more luxury of time for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She must seek
Jefferson's immediate and unconditional resignation from Congress.
    <P></P>Unfortunately, prosecutors have had to deal with political interference
in this criminal probe by Nancy Pelosi and Dennis Hastert. These House
leaders should not have criticized the FBI raid on Jefferson's Capitol Hill
office, and the administration should not have agreed to seal the records
that were seized. The American people side with the prosecutors and FBI
agents who are trying to get to the bottom of all the corruption on Capitol
Hill.
    <P></P>There is indeed a 'culture of corruption' in the House. Pelosi now has
a chance to do something about it." END BOEHM STATEMENT
   <P></P> NLPC filed a 500-page Complaint with the U.S. Attorney for the District
of Columbia on February 28, 2006, resulting in an investigation of Rep.
Alan Mollohan (D-WV). In the ensuing firestorm, Mollohan resigned as the
ranking member of his party on the House Ethics Committee. NLPC's Complaint
alleges that Mollohan had 262 omissions and misrepresentations on his
financial disclosure forms, and had an unexplained increase in personal
wealth from 2000-2004. As a member of the Appropriations Committee,
Mollohan earmarked at least $178 million to nonprofit groups he created
during the same period. A grand jury has reportedly been convened in the
Mollohan case.
    <P></P>NLPC promotes ethics in public life, and sponsors the Government
Integrity Project.<!-- #EndEditable -->
