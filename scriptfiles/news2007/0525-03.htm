<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 25 - ACORN members celebrated a milestone in a  years-long campaign for living wages after Congress approved the first increase in the federal minimum wage rate in a decade on Thursday night. 
<P></P>"This long-overdue wage increase will bring millions of America's hardest-working families closer to making ends meet," said ACORN President Maude Hurd. "Voters have made it clear again and again that they believe that rewarding hard work with fair pay is the right thing to do-and eventually our leaders had to follow." By a vote of 348 to 73, the House approved a measure to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour from $5.15 in three stages over two years. The wage increase was approved in the Senate soon after, where it was combined with a bill providing more money for the Iraq war. "We will keep fighting until the minimum wage is a living wage," Hurd added. "The minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation; we will continue to work with our allies in Congress and around the country to see minimum wage return to something that can help sustain a working family."

<P></P>On Election Day 2006, ACORN members in four states -- Missouri, Arizona, Colorado, and Ohio - celebrated the overwhelming success of ballot initiative campaigns to raise the minimum wage and index the wage to inflation. Working with a wide range of partners, ACORN initiated and organized these campaigns and coordinated signature-gathering that qualified them for the ballot. ACORN then ran ambitious field operations - especially in MO and OH, where thousands of members, volunteers and staff participated. The campaigns delivered a raise to 1.5 million workers and demonstrated broad public support for fair wages. 

<P></P>ACORN has pushed for local "living wage" laws in and states around the country for a decade, passing dozens of such policies. .
