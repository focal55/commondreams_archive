<p>    LOS ANGELES - October 15 - Robert Greenwald's Brave New Films is calling for an investigation of the Giuliani administration's failure to provide New York City firefighters with radios that could have saved lives on 9/11.  BNF's latest short video documentary, THE REAL RUDY: RADIOS, features parents of firefighters who died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 explaining that the radios that firefighters carried into the World Trade Center were obsolete and incapable of receiving police broadcasts.  As a consequence, firefighters in the North Tower never received an alert from an NYPD helicopter that the building was in danger of collapse, and remained in place while police officers evacuated.  The building's collapse killed 121 firefighters.  The Giuliani administration, these families assert, had seven years to replace these antiquated radios and failed to do so.

<P></P>
THE REAL RUDY: RADIOS is being released alongside a petition requesting that New York City Councilman Eric Gioia initiate a public investigation to answer these questions:
<ul>
<li>Why was nothing done to improve FDNY radio performance for seven years after a clear need was demonstrated in the 1993 World Trade Center attack?</li>
<li>When new radios were finally ordered, why did the city award a contract to Motorola without a competitive bidding process?</li>
<li>Once Motorola was given the contract, why did its cost jump from $1.4 million to $14 million?</li>
<li>Why were these new radios never field tested?</ul>
<P></P>

<P></P>
Based on months of research and interviews, THE REAL RUDY:RADIOS includes testimonies from Wayne Barrett, senior editor of The Village Voice and author of "Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11;" Glenn Corbett, Fire Science Professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice; FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches, who lost his son on 9/11; Retired FDNY Chief of Safety Al Santora, who also lost his son on 9/11, and several other experts and relatives of deceased firefighters.
<P></P>
THE REAL RUDY: RADIOS follows on the heels of THE REAL RUDY: COMMAND CENTER.  THE REAL RUDY: COMMAND CENTER has garnered 249,535 views and counting, and had more views in its first week than Giuliani's campaign website received that entire month. </li>
