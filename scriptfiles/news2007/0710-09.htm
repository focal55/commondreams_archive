<p>WASHINGTON  - JULY 10 -   “The President’s Iraq policy has been one failure after another.  The President’s decision to escalate this mistake has led to more instability, more violence, and more needless deaths.  It is encouraging to see some Republicans finally coming around to the reality that the President’s course in Iraq has failed.  But as the Senate prepares to once again debate the war in Iraq, Americans will be watching closely to see if that talk is backed up with real action.  We need to pass tough legislation that will end our military involvement in this Iraqi civil war so that we can refocus on the global fight against al Qaeda.” 

 

<P></P>Senator Feingold intends to offer the Feingold-Reid legislation as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill.  The legislation requires the redeployment of U.S. troops in Iraq to begin within 120 days with virtually all U.S. troops being redeployed by March 31, 2008, after which funding for the continued military operation in Iraq would end.
