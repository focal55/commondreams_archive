<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; JULY 18 &mdash; “Today, a majority of the Senate backed binding legislation with a firm end date to redeploy our troops from Iraq.  This shows how far we’ve come since August 2005 when I became the first Senator to propose a deadline to bring the mistake in Iraq to an end.  If we had enacted my proposal when I first offered it, our troops would be home right now.  Although a number of Republicans have finally acknowledged that the President’s Iraq policy is a failure, their filibuster of the Levin-Reed amendment shows they are still failing to back up their words with action.  The Levin-Reed amendment is by no means perfect, but its binding provisions to end our extensive military involvement in Iraq are a significant step forward.  With their decision to filibuster, the Republicans have prevented the Senate from voting to bring the open-ended mission in Iraq to an end, and have once again ignored the calls of the American people.”
