<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 24 - In a debate last night hosted by CNN and You Tube, some Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to or even support for increasing the use of nuclear power in the United States.

 

<P></P>Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder had the following reaction:

 

<P></P>“I was disappointed to see Senator Obama embrace nuclear energy, and to see Senator Clinton express openness to the idea,” Blackwelder said. “The national debate on energy needs a different focus.  We have the ability to fight global warming with safe energy, such as wind and solar, and with increased efficiency.  As the reactor accidents in Japan last week reminded us, nuclear plants are vulnerable to natural disasters.  More nuclear power plants in the U.S. could also be a terrorist’s dream come true.  And then there’s the problem of what to do with all of this radioactive waste.  The case against nuclear is clear.  It is unfortunate that not all presidential candidates agree.”

 

<P></P>From last night’s debate

 

<P></P>
<i>OBAMA: I actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix.

 

</i>
<P></P>
<i>CLINTON: I'm agnostic about nuclear power. John is right, that until we figure out what we're going to do with the waste and the cost, it's very hard to see nuclear as a part of our future. But that's where American technology comes in. Let's figure out what we're going to do about the waste and the cost if we think nuclear should be a part of the solution.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
