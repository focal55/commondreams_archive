It is now supported by 52 Members of the House of Representatives. <br><br>“And it is supported by groups who yesterday came to Washington representing 45 states. Last night, nearly 1,000 people came to the George Washington University campus to hear about the Department of Peace and the hope that it brings for America.<br><br>“Mr. Speaker if you were to look at this clerk’s desk, just around the corner you’ll see engraved right into the desk of the Clerk of the House of Representatives the word peace. <br><br>“Peace is a foundational principle of this Congress and of this country and the bill gives it a chance to have an animating power in our civic life by addressing the issues of domestic violence, spousal abuse, child abuse, violence in the schools and racial violence. &nbsp;<br><br>
“All of the concerns we have both domestically and internationally: peace.”
