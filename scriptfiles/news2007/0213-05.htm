<p>WASHINGTON - February 13 - The response by the Bush Administration&rsquo;s Justice Department to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg&rsquo;s efforts to combat illegal gun trafficking come across as an effort to silence the messenger rather than respond to the problem of a rise in violent crime,&rdquo; according to Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. <br />
<br />
Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s office last year carefully constructed a program of apparent straw purchases of firearms, sending teams of investigators into gun shops.&nbsp; As a result of the operation the City filed suit against a total of 27 shops. <br />
<br />
In a letter to Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt dated February 6, 2007, the U.S. Justice Department&rsquo;s Michael A. Battle indicated that they would not be bringing criminal prosecutions against gun dealers videotaped selling guns to apparent gun traffickers and also warned New York City officials about &ldquo;potential legal liabilities&rdquo; in connection with the city&rsquo;s investigation.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The New York City straw purchase sting operations already are enhancing public safety.&nbsp; Six of the dealers who were sued have settled their cases by agreeing to allow closer scrutiny of their business operations.&nbsp; As a direct result of the Mayor&rsquo;s sting operation, the industry trade association the National Shooting Sports Foundation, recently warned gun dealers that it was &ldquo;imperative&rdquo; that they &ldquo;review their business practices,&rdquo; calling upon dealers to participate in an NSSF-ATF program to train dealers to spot and prevent straw purchases. <br />
<br />
Mayor Bloomberg, along with Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston, helped start a Coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which now represents over 150 mayors.&nbsp; The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence launched its own Campaign Against Illegal Guns in March 2006 and has been working to support the efforts of Mayor Bloomberg and the other mayors to stop illegal gun trafficking.<!-- #EndEditable -->
