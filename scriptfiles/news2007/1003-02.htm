<p>  VANCOUVER - October 3 – Supporters of the call for sanctuary in Canada for U.S. war resisters are demanding that the threatened deportation of conscientious objector Robin Long be halted immediately. "The Canadian government should not be complicit in Mr. Long facing court martial and prison for refusing to fight George Bush’s war in Iraq", declared Bradley Hughes of the Vancouver War Resisters Support Campaign.
<p></p>
They will be at the Immigration Canada office at 300 West Georgia Avenue (at Hamilton Street) at 9:30 am, Wednesday, October 3 to provide moral support to Mr. Long and demand that Canadian officials not be used by the Harper Government as auxiliaries to the U.S. military police .
<p></p>
During the war in Vietnam this country and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau welcomed American war resisters: "Indeed our political approach has been to give them access to Canada. Canada should be a refuge from militarism," he said.
<p></p>
Two war resisters’ cases are currently before the Supreme Court of Canada and dozens more are at various stages of the refugee process; no one should be arrested or deported before the Supreme Court has a chance to make a decision.
<p></p>
Robin Long, from Boise, Idaho, received his orders in March 2005 and left for Canada in June 2005. Mr. Long came to Canada because he believes the war in Iraq is illegal. The Immigration Refugee Board did not find his claims to be untruthful but ruled against his case on the grounds that the "illegality of the war was not relevant" to his refugee claim. This is an issue that should be decided by the Supreme Court or the Parliament of Canada through the passage a provision to make Canada once again a sanctuary from militarism.
<p></p>
A July 2007 USA Today Gallup poll found that 62 per cent of Americans say the U.S. made a mistake in sending troops to Iraq. Moreover, 71 per cent favour a proposal to remove most U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008. A recent poll taken in Ontario showed that almost two thirds of Ontarians, or 64.4%, believed that Canada should allow war resisters to stay in Canada. <!-- #EndEditable -->
