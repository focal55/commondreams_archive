<p> WASHINGTON  &ndash;- May 2 – This afternoon, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee sent a biofuels bill sponsored by Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) to the full Senate.  In response, Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder issued the following statement:

 

<P></P>“Majority Leader Harry Reid said global warming would be the Senate’s first priority after Iraq.  If the Senate stands by Reid’s priorities, the Bingaman-Domenici bill must be soundly defeated.  Not only would the bill’s provisions increase total pollution, it would do so at the cost of billions of gallons of water, millions of acres of land and increased use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers.

 

<P></P>“In response to pressure from environmental organizations including Friends of the Earth, the committee added greenhouse gas emission limits for biofuels produced at new facilities to the bill, but these limits are not strong enough and they fail to address facilities that already exist.

 

<P></P>“Majority Leader Reid must do better.”
