<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - President Bush is touring the nation, touting a health care proposal that only pretends to address our nation&#8217;s health care crisis, and actually would make it worse.
<P>&nbsp;The President&#8217;s proposal to make workers pay taxes on health benefits in order to pay for a new standard deduction will prompt employers to shift more costs onto workers or eliminate coverage altogether.</P><P>&nbsp;At the same time, a tax- based approach to helping the uninsured doesn't work because many of the uninsured have too little income to buy health coverage on their own. They also won&#8217;t benefit from a deduction because they owe little or no taxes. </P><P>At a time when most Americans are struggling to pay for rising health care costs, the employer-based system is the last line of defense for working people. Two of every three Americans receive health insurance through their employer. Without a meaningful, comprehensive alternative, the shift from employer to individual responsibility will exacerbate the nation&#8217;s health care crisis and actually increase the number of uninsured and underinsured. </P><P>Under the President&#8217;s plan, younger and healthier workers would have more incentives to buy low-cost, bare-bones plans, leading to higher costs for older and less healthy workers who stay in more comprehensive coverage. And those more costly workers who remain in comprehensive plans take a double hit, since the arbitrary threshold means they&#8217;ll pay more in taxes, too. </P><P>America is the richest, most prosperous nation on earth. It&#8217;s a national disgrace that nearly 47 million Americans lack health insurance and millions more struggle to hold onto their coverage. </P><P>We need universal health coverage to ensure that every American has the security of knowing they can get affordable health care when they need it.
