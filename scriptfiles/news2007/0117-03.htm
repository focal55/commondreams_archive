<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - Wackenhut Puerto Rico
must pay an $80,000 settlement to former employee Catalina Lopez Vasquez in
a case that was brought by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) regarding sexual harassment and retaliation under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of
1991. Wackenhut Puerto Rico is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wackenhut
Corporation, which is owned by London-based security conglomerate Group 4
Securicor.
   <p> The court will enforce the five year settlement that includes the
creation of a Wackenhut anti-discrimination policy, a new anti-retaliation
policy, mandatory training on sexual discrimination and reporting for
Wackenhut's managers and supervisory personnel at its corporate
headquarters in Puerto Rico.
 <p>   At least three other cases are currently pending in U.S. District Court
in which Wackenhut is named as a defendant, involving allegations of
various forms of discrimination or civil rights violations, including race
discrimination arising from the company's security work.
   <p> Wackenhut or its subsidiaries have been involved in extensive
discrimination litigation in U.S. District Court in addition to this case
and at least three others currently pending:
  <p>  * Wackenhut discriminated against Lisa Lulaj on the basis of sex, and
    awarded her damages according to a Detroit jury in April 2006;
execution
    of judgment has been stayed pending resolution of appeals.
 <p>   * Judgment was entered against Wackenhut in March 2006 in a case
brought
    by Karen Franklin in Seattle, who alleged she suffered gender and race
    discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment.
  <p>  * An African-American former Vice President and General Manager for the
    National Capitol Region has sued Wackenhut for race discrimination in
    Washington, D.C.
 <p>   * Two cases in Tennessee allege racial discrimination in hiring,
promotion
    and advancement, and a racially hostile workplace at the U.S.
Department
    of Energy's Oak Ridge Reservation.
