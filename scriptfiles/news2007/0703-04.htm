<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 3 -Following reports of civilians killed this weekend in Sadr City by US military fire and bombing, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today called for full, transparent investigation by the US military.

<P></P>On June 30th, according to the Associated Press, US forces conducted two raids in Sadr city in search of militants hiding among the civilian population. Witnesses—including surviving residents, police and hospital officials—said as many as 26 innocent Iraqis were killed during the operation, including a number of children. There has been no from the US military yet as to whether it will launch an investigation, however Lt. Col. Christopher Garver defended the raids by stating “Everyone who got shot was shooting at US troops at the time.”

<P></P>"Every civilian death deserves recognition and the families suffering a loss deserve the dignity of knowing the circumstances,” said Sarah Holewinski, CIVIC’s executive director. "If and when the US may be at fault, an investigation is appropriate and just."

<P></P>CIVIC today said US collateral damage assessments after combat should be standard operating procedure and that investigations into civilian deaths are appropriate and necessary to earn the support of the Iraqi people. Whenever possible the Iraqi government should be allowed to participate in investigations, particularly given Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki condemnation of the operations conducted in Sadr City.

<P></P>"Investigate, figure out what went wrong, why civilians were killed, then fix the problem," said Holewinski. "That effort would show the Iraqi people that US troops care."
