<p>POTSDAM, Germany - March 16  -  “G8: Stop Talking – Act Now” is the 
message sent by Greenpeace today to environment ministers meeting in the 
Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam, Germany. Activists from the Greenpeace 
ship “Beluga II” swam to the palace to take a petition to the ministers 
urging them to use the forthcoming June G8 summit in Germany to agree 
concrete action to halt climate change.

<p>“Bush and Co. have betrayed the cause of climate protection up to now. 
We have 13 years at most to avert the worst impacts of climate 
destruction, and yet there is not even a glimmer of a breakthrough on 
the horizon at present,” says Greenpeace International Climate & Energy 
campaigner Stephanie Tunmore. “On the contrary: Global greenhouse gas 
emissions are continuing to rise, up to one quarter coming from the 
destruction of forests. The G8 states are also reporting rising 
emissions, although the industrialized nations are in fact committed to 
curbing emissions by 2012.”

<p>Where greenhouse gas emissions have fallen, this has been largely due to 
the collapse of economies in the former eastern bloc countries. In 
almost all countries that did not experience this process, emissions 
have risen, in some cases dramatically. Canada leads the laggards with 
30 percent higher greenhouse gas emissions than in 1990, followed by the 
United States (15.7 percent up), Italy (12.3 percent up) and Japan (7.7 
percent up). Since reaching the Kyoto target in 1998, Tony Blair has 
made poor progress and in fact CO2 emissions in the UK are climbing.

<p>“This means that the ‘leading industrialized nations’ are miles away 
from their binding Kyoto targets,” continues Tunmore. “If something does 
not happen soon, we will be heading straight towards a climate disaster. 
The G8 Summit in June must deliver the breakthrough.”

<p>In concrete terms, Greenpeace is urging the G8 environment ministers to 
commit to slashing their greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the 
year 2020. The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution report shows that this is 
achievable by stepping up energy production from wind, solar and 
biomass. Power from coal and nuclear must be phased out and the 
destruction of forests must stop. Greenpeace calls upon Germany, the 
country hosting the meeting, to send a strong signal to the climate 
crisis summit in Heiligendamm by announcing a 40 percent target in the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, with no ifs and buts.<!-- #EndEditable -->
