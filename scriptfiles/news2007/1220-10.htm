<p>WASHINGTON - December 20 - Relatives of those killed and injured at Virginia Tech offered their thanks today to members of Congress who worked to pass legislation yesterday that would strengthen the Brady background check system.&nbsp; The bill, H.R. 2640, which provides incentives to improve the states’ submission of records of dangerous people into the Brady system, was passed late Wednesday as Congress adjourned for the holidays.&nbsp; Following are some of their comments:</p>

<ul>
    <li>“Cathy and I have been praying for a good outcome on this legislation, and we are tremendously grateful for the efforts of Senator Schumer and Representative McCarthy in moving this legislation to the President's desk.&nbsp; We also want to particularly thank Senators Warner and Webb, as well as Representative Tom Davis, for their part in representing our concerns as Virginia residents and Virginia Tech parents,” said <strong>Peter Read</strong>, whose daughter, Mary Read, 19, wanted to teach elementary school - and who baked strawberry cakes for her friends on their birthdays. “This will be one of the best Christmas presents we could ask for as soon as the ink is dry on the President's signature - it is a testament to the memory of Mary and her fellow fallen Hokies, as well as all victims of gun violence.&nbsp; There is much, much more to do, but this is a good start.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>“Jeri and I are extremely gratified that the tireless efforts of Representative McCarthy, Senator Schumer, and other members of the U. S. Congress have finally resulted in the unanimous passage of the NICS Improvement Act of 2007,” said <strong>Michael Bishop</strong>, the father of German professor Jamie Bishop, 35, who was known for hosting gatherings of students in his home for practicing language, playing music and watching films.&nbsp; “Millions of Americans are safer today because of their work and because of this bill. We cannot help adding the sobering observation that had this bill been law just a year ago, the shootings at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, might never have occurred.”</li>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li>“During Congresswoman McCarthy's speech on October 16, she alluded to the people of our Nation losing faith in their elected representatives when they fail to enact laws that intend to protect and serve the people.&nbsp; On behalf of the Clark family, the light shines brighter when we know that there are people working together to prevent an event like April 16,” said <strong>Letitie Clark</strong>, the mother of Ryan Clark, 22, a senior who played baritone sax in the Virginia Tech band.&nbsp; “Thanks to Congresswoman McCarthy, Senator Schumer and the others, there are families who will never experience the darkness we know. Moreover, thanks for standing in the gap when it is difficult for us to even breathe and talk at the same time.&nbsp; May our hearts forever remember the peace that the passing of H. R. 2640 has brought.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>“Emily and I were sitting up late, just the two of us, when we heard the news,” said <strong>Lori Haas</strong>, whose 19-year-old daughter survived and is recovering. “We were very happy to hear about it.&nbsp; I’ve already written thank you notes to the leaders on the bill in Congress, and my next correspondence is to the White House to ask the President to please sign this bill.”&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
<p>Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, praised the Virginia Tech families for their support of this legislation.&nbsp; “On October 16, the six month anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings, many of these families called on Congress to act.&nbsp; Yesterday’s vote sends the message that our elected officials are willing to take action to strengthen our tragically weak gun laws by making it harder for dangerous people to get guns.&nbsp; This is a difficult time for these families, but now they know that Congress has started to deal with this issue.”</p><p align="center"># # #</p>
