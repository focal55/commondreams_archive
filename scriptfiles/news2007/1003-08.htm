<p>  WASHINGTON - October 3 – The destruction of satellites by anti-satellite weapons would produce much larger amounts of space debris than is commonly understood, according to an article featured in this month's issue of the science journal Physics Today. According to the article, written by physicist David Wright, destroying just one large satellite, such as a U.S. reconnaissance satellite, would double the amount of debris in low Earth orbit (below 1,250 miles) large enough to damage or destroy other satellites. Dr. Wright is the co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The article-one of the first to project the amount of debris resulting from destroying satellites using anti-satellite weapons-includes background information on the amount and sources of current debris, how it is distributed in space, and the threat it poses to satellites in orbit. It also examines the consequences of China's test in January of an anti-satellite system that blew up a small satellite.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dr. Wright concludes that destroying one large satellite would cancel out any debris reduction that would be achieved over several decades under the international debris mitigation program that is expected to be adopted by the UN General Assembly this fall.</div>
