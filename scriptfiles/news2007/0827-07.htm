<p>WASHINGTON - August 27 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement, calling on President Bush to appoint an independent Attorney General who will uphold the Constitution and restore faith in the U.S. justice system:
<P></P>
"Attorney General Gonzales has been nothing but a prop for this Administration to bypass the Constitution. His presence has given President Bush the ability to act with no regard to laws," Kucinich said.
<P></P>
"Throughout his tumultuous tenure as Attorney General, Gonzales has continually denied the American people the truth they deserve. President Bush has stood by his longtime friend regardless of his actions. Now is the time for the President to seize this opportunity and appoint a new Attorney General who independently serves the American people.
<P></P>
"The embarrassment and abuse of power stemming from the Attorney General's office has eroded the credibility and leadership of the Justice Department.
<P></P>
"The President needs to use this occasion to appoint an Attorney General who will follow the laws and uphold the Constitution," Kucinich concluded.
