<p>NEW YORK - March 8 - Girls the world over confront an alarming 
array of threats to their safety, including physical and sexual violence in 
their schools, places of work, and in detention facilities, said Human 
Rights Watch today, in advance of International Women's Day on March 
8. Governments have largely failed to implement key measures preventing 
and responding to these abuses. 

<p>Human Rights Watch recently released three background papers 
summarizing research on violence against girls: "Violence against 
Schoolgirls;" "Violence against Child Domestic Workers;" and "Violence 
against Girls in Conflict with the Law." These reports are based on Human 
Rights Watch investigations in 15 countries, including: Afghanistan; 
Brazil; the Democratic Republic of Congo; Egypt; El Salvador; 
Guatemala; Indonesia; Iraq; Malaysia; Morocco; Papua New Guinea; 
South Africa,; Togo; the United States; and Zambia.   
  
<p>"Girls are at risk of violence on the streets, in schools, at home, where 
they work, and in government institutions," said Jo Becker, advocacy 
director for Human Rights Watch's children's rights division. "In far too 
many cases, girls are betrayed by the very individuals who are supposed to 
protect them - guardians, teachers, employers and the police."   
  
<p>Schoolgirls may be raped, sexually assaulted, and sexually harassed by 
their classmates and even by their teachers. A medical research study 
found that among those South African rape victims who specified their 
relationship to the perpetrator, 37.7 percent said that a schoolteacher or 
principal had raped them. Students may also be targeted because of their 
sexual orientation or gender identity.   
  
<p>In situations of armed conflict, attacks against schools and teachers may 
keep girls out of school altogether. In Afghanistan, from January 2005 to 
June 2006, Human Rights Watch documented more than 200 incidents of 
teachers and students being killed or threatened, and schools being blown 
up or burned down. Such violence disproportionately affects girls, who are 
more likely than boys to be withdrawn from school.   
  
<p>Employers may subject child domestic workers to verbal and physical 
abuse, including severe beatings, burning with irons, and death threats. 
These children are often confined to their employer's household, with 
little access to outside help. Child domestic workers are particularly 
vulnerable to sexual harassment and sexual violence from men and boys 
living in or associated with the household. More girls are employed in 
domestic work than any other form of child labor.   
  
<p>Girls in contact with justice systems are at risk of violence, particularly 
sexual abuse and rape, by police as well as staff in detention facilities. 
Police may target girls who live or work on the street for violence. Girls in 
detention may confront physical and sexual violence and humiliating 
treatment, particularly by male staff, and face violent or harmful 
disciplinary measures. Because of their smaller numbers, girls subject to 
detention are more likely than boys to be held in unsuitable and often 
dangerous conditions.   
  
<p>"In some areas, girls are making enormous strides, but violence stops 
many from enjoying their basic rights," said Becker. "Governments need 
to back up words with action, and show that violence against girls won't 
go unpunished."   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch urged governments to take immediate steps to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Create confidential, fully staffed and toll-free hotlines to receive 
reports of abuses against girls, including mechanisms accessible to 
students, domestic workers, and children in detention;</li>
<li> 	Ensure the prompt and effective investigation of such complaints, 
and prompt and appropriate action against perpetrators, including 
counseling, termination and criminal prosecution when warranted;</li>
<li> 	Ensure that medical examinations, trauma counseling, emergency 
contraception, and post-exposure HIV prophylaxis are available to 
sexual assault survivors;</li>
<li> 	In situations of insecurity, devise and implement a strategy to 
monitor, prevent, and respond to attacks on education, with special 
attention to the effects of attacks on girls' education; and</li>
<li> Ensure that children in conflict with the law are only detained as a 
last resort and for the shortest possible time. Prohibit the excessive 
use of force, and any disciplinary measures that may compromise 
the health of the child.</li>
