<p>WASHINGTON - January 19 - The Center for Public Integrity's <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/telecom/report.aspx?aid=837" target=_blank>lawsuit</a> to obtain broadband records from the Federal Communication Commission has attracted industry-wide attention as major telecommunications companies and trade associations seek to block the release of the high-speed Internet service data for publication.</p>
<p>The move by AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications to intervene in the lawsuit caused Judge Rosemary Collyer to recuse herself Jan. 17. The case was reassigned to Judge Ellen Huvelle.</p>
<p>"[Collyer] recused herself because there is a motion to intervene pending by AT&amp;T, and she owns stock in AT&amp;T," the judge's law clerk Kristin Dighe told Drew Clark, senior fellow and project manager of the Center's "<a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/telecom/default.aspx" target=_blank>Well Connected</a>" telecommunications, media and technology project. Collyer's 2005 financial disclosure statement revealed that she owned between $15,000 to $50,000 of stock in AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>The Center today posted a new <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/telecom/report.aspx?aid=837" target=_blank>Web page</a> that makes public all of the legal documents filed in the <em>Center for Public Integrity v. FCC</em> case.</p>
<p>The FCC consistently has denied academics, journalists, companies and other parties access to its database listing companies that have deployed broadband services. The Center filed suit under the Freedom of Information Act Sept. 25, 2006, seeking to make public data about these companies through its <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/telecom/default.aspx" target=_blank>Media Tracker</a>, a free, Internet-based database of radio, television, newspaper and cable companies searchable by ZIP code. Media Tracker also provides information on the political influence of the major players in the telecommunications, media and technology industries.</p>
<p>"Using the Media Tracker, anyone in the country can identify the companies that own their television and radio stations and cable systems," said Clark. "Given the increasing importance of broadband as a means of economic development, democratic participation and entertainment, FCC data about the locations in which companies sell high-speed Internet service should be publicly available as well."</p>
<p>In court papers filed Jan. 8, AT&amp;T, Verizon and the United States Telecom Association, to which both companies belong, objected to the release of the broadband data, as did Wireless Communications Association International, a trade group representing a range of wireless broadband service providers. All stated that release of the data held by the FCC would cause competitive harm. The Department of Justice and the FCC filed their response to the Center's complaint on Jan. 8, the court-imposed deadline.</p>
<p>Separately, CTIA — the wireless association formerly known as the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association — supported the FCC in a "friend of the court" brief filed Jan. 8. A fourth association, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, seeks to file a similar brief.</p>
<p>The Center's reply to the government and to the intervening companies is due Feb.12.</p><ContentEnd />
