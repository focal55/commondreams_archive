<p>NEW YORK - February 20 - The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR)&#44; which represents many of the 

Guantanamo detainees and coordinates the efforts of hundreds of pro bono attorneys across the country&#44; condemned 

today's two-to-one decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in the combined cases of <i>Al Odah v. USA</i> and 

<i>Boumediene v. Bush</i>&#44; the first lawsuits challenging the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) to be addressed 

by the courts. Todays ruling states that the Guantanamo detainees have no constitutional right to habeas corpus&#44; 

therefore the passage of the MCA by Congress eliminated the statutory right to challenge their detention in the 

courts. 

<P>










The MCA&#44; which was signed into law by President Bush on October 17&#44; 2006&#44; is the second attempt by the Bush 

administration to strip detainees of their statutory right to challenge their detention in the courts&#44; a right that 

the Supreme Court has already affirmed twice&#44; in CCR's landmark case <i>Rasul v. Bush</i> in 2004 and in <i>Hamdan 

v. Rumsfeld</i> in 2006.  The act also allows for evidence obtained through torture&#44; - a violation of the Geneva 

Conventions - and greatly widens the scope of who the president can label an "enemy combatant."

<P>










"This decision empowers the President to do whatever he wishes to prisoners without any legal limitation as long as 

he does it off shore&#44; and encourages such notorious practices as extraordinary rendition and a contempt for 

international human rights law&#44;" said Shayana Kadidal&#44; managing attorney of the Center for Constitutional 

Rights Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative. "The matter will ultimately have to be resolved by the Supreme Court 

for a third time." 

<P>










<i>Al Odah v. USA</i> consists of the first eleven habeas petitions filed after the landmark Supreme Court decision 

in <i>Rasul v. Bush</i>. The <i>Boumediene</i> appeal&#44; filed jointly by CCR and cooperating counsel Wilmer&#44; 

Pickering&#44; Cutler&#44; Hale&#44; & Dorr and Clifford Chance&#44; is on behalf of six Bosnian humanitarian workers seized by the 

U.S. military in Bosnia after the Bosnian courts ordered local authorities to release them. In <i>Al Odah</i>&#44; D.C. 

District Court Judge Joyce Hens Green stated that detainees possess "the fundamental right to due process of law 

under the Fifth Amendment." Reaching an entirely different conclusion&#44; Judge Richard Leon dismissed the 

<i>Boumediene</i> appeals&#44; ruling that the detainees possess no constitutional rights to habeas corpus. Both cases 

were appealed&#44; and the two cases were consolidated for oral arguments before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals&#44; 

which were heard in November 2006.   

<P>










"We call on the legal profession and all Americans concerned about the loss of liberty undertaken by the Bush 

Administration and now rubber stamped by the Court of Appeals to join with us in taking this fight to the United 

States Supreme Court. We call on Congress to take up the fight that the American people sent you to Washington to 

wage&#44; to quickly enact legislation that will begin the process of restoring our most fundamental rights&#44;" said CCR 

Legal Director Bill Goodman.

<P>










"Habeas corpus is a right that was enshrined in the Magna Carta to prevent kings from indefinitely and arbitrarily 

detaining anyone they chose-the combined actions of the Bush Administration&#44; the previous Congress and two of the 

three judges today have taken us back 900 years and granted the right of kings to the president&#44;" said CCR Executive 

Director Vincent Warren. <!-- #EndEditable -->
