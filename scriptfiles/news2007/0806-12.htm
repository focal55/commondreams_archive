<p>BANGOR, WA - AUGUST 6 - 60 people were present in an early dawn demonstration against nuclear weapons at the Trident submarine base at Bangor.  Both personnel entrances were briefly blocked at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor while Navy personnel and support personnel were arriving for work at the base on Monday morning.
<br><br>Around 6 am, five peace activists blocked the Trigger entrance to the submarine base, at NW Trigger Avenue, and were arrested by Kitsap County Sheriffs.  Shortly after, four activists separately walked onto federal property at the Trigger entrance and were arrested by base security. 
<br><br>Meanwhile, two peace activists separately entered federal property at the main gate to the Trident submarine base, on Highway 308, and were arrested by base security.  Three activists then separately walked onto the highway to block traffic and were arrested by Kitsap County Sheriffs.
<br><br>This marked the first demonstration in recent years when both personnel entrances were blocked at similar times at the Trident submarine base.
<br><br>Peace activists at the main gate to the base held a large banner proclaiming Hiroshima and Nagasaki Never Again.  Other activists carried posters showing the destruction caused by atomic bombs upon the Japanese cities.
<br><br>Those arrested by federal officers:  Denny Moore and Donna Moore of Bainbridge Island; Jody Tiller of Olympia; Marya Barr and Karol Schulkin of Ventura, California; and Woody Pidcock of Seattle.
<br><br>Those arrested by Kitsap County Sheriffs:  Lynne Greenwald of Bremerton; Joy Goldstein of Vashon; Brenda McMillan of Port Townsend; Ellen Kohjima of Tacoma; Mack Johnson of Silverdale; and Rev. Anne Hall, Dr. David Hall and Rose Betz-Zall of Seattle.
<br><br>
                       

Demonstrators arrested on federal property were booked at the Trident submarine base and released.  It is unclear whether charges will be filed at this time.
<br><br>Demonstrators arrested by Kitsap County Sheriffs were booked at the Port Orchard jail and released.  Demonstrators may be charged with disorderly conduct.
<br><br>Since May 2006, peace activists have been arrested, without a warning, by Kitsap County Sheriff’s officers as soon as they crossed the fog line along the entrance to the base, making it more difficult for demonstrators to communicate their message to the general public.

<br><br>14 peace activists arrested marking the 62nd Anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombing at the Trident submarine base at Bangor, WA
<br><br>This August, the Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action is celebrating 30 years of resistance to the Trident submarine system and all nuclear weapons.  Ground Zero members, Jim Douglass, Shelley Douglass, Marya Barr, Karol Schulkin and Kim Wahl, who were influential during formative years of Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action, were present at the August events.
<br><br>This year, demonstrators were also joined with members of the Nipponzan Myohoji Buddhist temple on Bainbridge Island, who with Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action members and others, completed a walk for peace, starting at Eugene, Oregon on July 15 and ending at the Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action on August 4, 2007.
<br><br>The Bangor Trident Submarine Base, just 20 miles from Seattle, has become home to the largest single stockpile of nuclear warheads in the U.S. arsenal.  In November 2006, the Natural Resource Defense Council declared the 2,364 nuclear warheads at Bangor are approximately 24 percent of the entire U.S. arsenal.
<br><br>The base at Bangor is also the last active nuclear weapons depot on the West Coast and has been recently rebuilt for the deployment of the larger and more accurate Trident D-5 missile system.  Each of the 24 D-5 missiles on a Trident submarine is capable of carrying eight of the larger 455 kiloton W-88 warheads (each warhead is about 30 times the explosive force as the Hiroshima bomb.)
<br><br>The Trident submarines at Bangor are likely to be used first in any nuclear attack: either as an isolated “tactical” assault on a specific site, bunker, or weapons location; or in a larger “strategic” nuclear attack.  The Bangor-based submarines can launch their weapons in secrecy and operate near Middle East and Asian targets.
<br><br>The Trident submarine base at Bangor currently has eight D-5 missile submarines.
<br><br>In addition, four older Trident submarines are being refitted to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles.  Two will be at Bangor.  These SSGN submarines can fire all of the cruise missiles on one submarine, 154 cruise missiles, in six minutes.
<br><br>In July, 2005 Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Navy announced a $9.2 million contract to develop a new submarine-launched intermediate-range ballistic missile (SLIRBM).  The SLIRBM will be capable of delivering a 1,000 lb. payload 1,200 miles within 15 minutes of launch.  A Tomahawk missile takes about 4 hours to cover the same distance.
<br><br>Either type of Trident submarine at Bangor, whether to launch D-5 nuclear missiles, cruise missiles, or the planned intermediate range ballistic missile, has unbelievable destructive force.
