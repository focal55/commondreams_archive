<p>WASHINGTON - October 17 - The American Civil Liberties 
Union today announced its opposition to the RESTORE Act, saying the bill gives 
the government the ability to spy upon Americans without an individual 
warrant.&nbsp; Since the bill does not require individual warrants before 
government agents seize material from Americans on American soil, it fails to be 
constitutional. </p>

<p>“The RESTORE Act does not live up 
to its name - it does not restore the Constitution,” said Director of the 
Washington Office Caroline Fredrickson. “When Americans are sitting in their 
living rooms making a phone call or sending an email, they should be able to 
rest assured that the government is not monitoring their phone call or 
collecting that email without just cause or an individual warrant.”&nbsp; 
Fredrickson added, “The RESTORE Act includes broad year-long basket warrants 
that require only minimum court oversight to collect the maximum amount of 
information.&nbsp; Basket warrants, by definition, are not warrants at 
all.&nbsp; They do not give Americans protections that the Founding Fathers had 
in mind when they wrote the Fourth Amendment. The colonists rose up against King 
George for the same type of government overreaching.” </p>
<p>The ACLU is also likely to oppose 
the Senate bill, which is reportedly worse on civil liberties issues.&nbsp; The 
Senate bill is likely to capitulate even more to Administration requests for 
broad new authority to spy on Americans.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“We thought the House Leadership 
meant what they said in August when they promised to put real civil liberties 
protections into the new legislation,” said ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel 
Timothy Sparapani. He added that the Senate should not be letting the telecom 
companies be allowed to be exempt from laws. “If the rumors about the Senate 
bill are true, it’s a sweet deal for companies that broke the law. Why follow 
the law when you can just re-write the rule-book?” said 
Sparapani.</p>
<p>“The House bill is a 
disappointment and does not contain the protections that Americans must have in 
a democratic society,” said ACLU lobbyist’ Michelle Richardson. “If the rumors 
are true, the Senate bill, like the Protect America Act, appears to have been 
written by the administration and is designed to give the government all the 
power and destroy even minimal checks and balances,” she added. </p>
