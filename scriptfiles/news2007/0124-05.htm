<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - On Saturday, January 27, the 
                            first environmentally-friendly modular home in the 
                            historic African American community of North Gulfport, 
                            Mississippi will be unveiled at a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
                            from 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. This special ceremony will 
                            occur at 8208 Ohio Street and will be followed by 
                            a tour of the model home and a block party. The event 
                            will showcase one of the most innovative solutions 
                            yet proposed to the housing crisis gripping the Gulf 
                            Coast after Hurricane Katrina.<br>
                            <br>
                            &#147;Housing is vital to preserving the work force, 
                            history, and cultural heritage of the Gulf Coast. 
                            The unveiling of the modular green house in North 
                            Gulfport represents a significant step towards restoring 
                            this unique and valuable community in a way that is 
                            both healthy and affordable,&#148; said Barbara R. 
                            Arnwine, Executive Director of the Lawyers' Committee 
                            for Civil Rights.<br>
                            <br>
                            The construction of this prototype house marks the 
                            culmination of years of work by the Lawyers' Committee, 
                            North Gulfport Community Land Trust, and Unity Homes. 
                            The North Gulfport Community Land Trust was organized 
                            recently to purchase land for the development of affordable 
                            housing. Unity Homes is working to establish a local 
                            factory that will produce environmentally friendly, 
                            affordable housing using modular construction techniques. 
                            The Lawyers' Committee has worked to establish both 
                            of these organizations as independent nonprofits and 
                            has facilitated their collaboration in this project.<br>
