<p>WASHINGTON - January 16 - Good morning I am Debbie Sease, Sierra Club's Director of National Campaigns.
<P>With some of Big Oil's best friends having been shown the door by the voters, the new Congress has a unique opportunity and responsibility to move America forward by taking the first step toward the energy policy we need and deserve. </P>

<P>And that first step will be to roll back these billions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies given to outdated energy industries, and instead redirect the money to programs that benefit American jobs and families, help end our dangerous oil dependence, and put us on the path toward real energy security. </P>

<P>We are extremely enthusiastic that the new Congress is poised to take action this week. Sending the "stop payment" notice to Big Oil is an important first step in these first 100 Hours. The next step will be to make sure that the new funds be spent on the energy solutions that provide the best deal for the American People.</P>

<P>H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, expected to be voted on this Thursday, will repeal $14 billion in subsidies benefiting the biggest oil companies. The bill will also provide a "strategic energy efficiency and renewables reserve" that will be used to support clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives. </P>

<P>The fund could be tapped to support future legislation such as: The Extension of Energy Efficiency Tax Incentives; the Extension of Renewable Energy Production Tax Credits; the Lifting of the cap on tax credits for Hybrid Cars; and additional funding for renewables like wind and solar power and energy efficiency.</P>

<P>As I said, the clean energy reserve will be funded by repealing $14 billion in subsidies that benefit the same major oil companies who are posting record profits at the expense of American consumers. This week's bill will:</P>

<P>Recover billions in unpaid royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling. Prevent additional future losses of royalties and; Prevent major oil companies such as ExxonMobil from claiming a tax break for "geological and geophysical" expenses; and it would also remove a tax benefit that lowers the income tax rate paid by oil companies by reclassifying oil and gas production as a manufactured good.</P>

<P>As my colleagues have said, Americans voted for Big Change, Not Big Oil. By supporting this part of the 100 Hours Agenda, the new Congress upholds the pledge made during the election to end corruption, bring about change and bring America closer to a cleaner, safer energy future.</P>
