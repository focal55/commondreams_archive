<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - German Chancellor Angela Merkel needs to follow the example of her president who is in Ghana this week talking to African heads of state and representatives of civil society, and deliver on Africa at the G8 Summit, says ActionAid.

 

<p>“We welcome President Koehler’s initiative and hope that Chancellor Merkel follows his example, taking a real interest in issues that go beyond the economic interests of rich countries”, said Anne Jellema, Head of Policy at ActionAid International.

 

<p>In less than 150 days, Chancellor Merkel welcomes Heads of State to the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, Germany. The agenda focuses on growth and responsibility with a special emphasis on Africa.  But up until now, Merkel has never visited the continent.   

 

 <p>“If Merkel wants to send a ‘positive message of trust in the future of Africa’ as she stated in the G8 agenda, she should listen to her African counterparts and take their needs into consideration,” said Jellema.

 

<p>“Merkel could deliver a positive message by ensuring there is a proper funding plan for universal access to anti-retrovirals and she could deliver that at the G8 Summit” said Jellema. “Only 20% of those who need antiretroviral therapy currently have access to it. We are about $10 billion short per year to meet the Universal Access target by 2010 and we can’t afford to wait any longer for a positive message”. 

 

<p>Interim South Africa Country Director for ActionAid International, Collins Magalasi, added:

 “If the G8 really cares about Africa it will support country-led processes rather than pushing reforms designed in Heiligendamm.”

 

<p> “Koehler acknowledges that good conditions for private investment are insufficient and African companies need better access to European and American markets whereas Merkel’s G8 agenda favours rich countries’ interests, bypassing the development needs of Africa,” he added.

 

<p>Notes to the Editor: 

<p>1.       The first Africa Conference was launched in Bonn, Germany in November 2005.

 

<p>2.     Participants at the Conference are Presidents Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf (Liberia), Olusegun Obasanjo (Nigeria), Thabo Mbeki (South Africa) Festus G. Mogae (Botswana) and Alpha Oumar Konaré (African Union), together with around 30 leaders from politics, business, research and culture.
