<p>WASHINGTON - February 12 - The League of Women Voters 
celebrates its 87th birthday on February 14. As the League honors the 
dedicated work of its many volunteer members over the years, and the 
accomplishments that have resulted, it is also looking to the future. In 
2007, League members will continue their commitment to improving 
communities across the country. Nationally, the League continues its 
work of strengthening voter participation and education, as well as 
promoting meaningful public policy change in the areas of civil 
liberties, representative government, and social 
policy.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;For nearly nine decades, Leagues members have 
engaged citizens in major public policy debates all over this country 
and encouraged elected leaders to support sound policies that benefit 
all citizens. They&#8217;ve registered and educated millions of voters. 
They&#8217;ve dedicated countless volunteer hours to improving their 
communities&#8212;and in doing so have made an incredible national and 
global impact,&#8221; said League President <st1:PersonName>Mary G. 
Wilson</st1:PersonName>.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Looking back, I could not be more proud of the 
League&#8217;s legacy of providing quality, trustworthy and balanced 
resources to citizens and lawmakers alike. The League of Women Voters 
truly has left its footprint on American history, and I believe our 
democracy is stronger because of it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Looking forward, I recognize that there is much 
work to be done. Today and in the future, the League remains committed 
to fulfilling its vital voter education role,&#8221; said 
<st1:City><st1:place>Wilson</st1:place></st1:City>. &#8220;Our members 
also look forward to affecting change by working on pressing issues such 
campaign finance reform, civil liberties, DC voting rights, election 
administration, ethics and lobbying reform, global climate change, 
healthcare reform and more.&#8221;</p>
