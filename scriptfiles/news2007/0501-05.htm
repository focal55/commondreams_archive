<p> NEW YORK - May 1 – The Iraqi government should return to past 
practice and immediately make public official figures on civilian 
casualties, Human Rights Watch said today.  

<P></P>In the past, the Iraqi government has released official data on civilian 
injuries and deaths – an important barometer of the war's human cost. But 
in an apparent reversal of policy, the government has refused to provide 
the United Nations with current data, which the UN requested for its new 
human rights report, released on April 25, 2007.   
  
<P></P>"Iraqi citizens face extreme violence every day and they deserve a full and 
accurate picture of what is taking place," said Sarah Leah Whitson, 
Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. "The Iraqi government 
should make public its figures on civilian deaths even if the picture is 
bleak. Withholding the facts will not make the situation any safer."   
  
<P></P>UN officials said the Iraqi government gave no official reason for 
withholding the data. But unofficially, the government expressed concern 
that the numbers would be "used to portray the situation as very grim," 
said Ivana Vuco, a UN human rights officer in Iraq. High casualty figures 
would "further undermine their efforts to establish some kind of security 
and stability in the country," she said at a news conference in Baghdad.   
  
<P></P>A new Baghdad security plan came into effect on February 14, 2007, 
which increased Iraqi and US troop levels in the capital.   
  
<P></P>Previous UN human rights reports have included official Iraqi figures on 
civilian casualties. The last report, issued in January 2007, said that 34,452 
civilians were killed and more than 36,000 wounded in 2006.   
  
<P></P>"Unlike previous reports, the new UNAMI Quarterly Human Rights report 
does not contain official statistics of violent deaths regularly gathered by 
the Ministry of Health and the Medico-Legal Institute in Baghdad," a UN 
statement said, referring to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq 
(UNAMI). "This is because the Iraqi Government decided not to make 
such data available to UNAMI."   
  
<P></P>According to UNAMI spokesman Said Arikat, Iraqi government officials 
criticized the UN's January 2007 human rights report, claiming the 
number of reported civilian casualties was too high.   
  
<P></P>The UN report released today covers the first three months of 2007. It 
documents serious human rights abuses by insurgents and various armed 
groups, including the targeting of civilians, law enforcement personnel, 
and government officials. The report cites some improvements by the Iraqi 
government but it criticizes the authorities for the ongoing use of torture 
and possible collusion between armed militias and Iraqi security forces.   
  
<P></P>Human Rights Watch has repeatedly condemned torture by Iraqi security 
forces, documented most comprehensively in a January 2005 report, "The 
New Iraq? Torture and Ill-treatment of Detainees in Iraqi Custody."   
  
<P></P>The UN report said civilian casualties between January 1, 2007 and March 
31 remained high, especially in and around Baghdad. It attributed the high 
level of violence to "large scale indiscriminate killings and targeted 
assassinations perpetrated by insurgency groups, militias and other armed 
groups." The violence killed large numbers of civilians, including women 
and children, in both Shi`a and Sunni neighborhoods, the report said.   
  
<P></P>Iraqi government officials claimed an initial decrease in killings in the 
second half of February 2007 after the new Baghdad Security Plan was 
implemented. But the number of reported casualties rose again in March, 
the report said.   
  
<P></P>The Iraqi government called the new UN report "inaccurate" and 
"unbalanced." In a statement, it said the report places the credibility of the 
UN in doubt and "aggravates the humanitarian crisis in Iraq."   
  
<P></P>On February 14, 2007, US troops increased their presence in and around 
Baghdad as part of the new security plan for which the United States has 
committed an extra 30,000 troops. Iraqi forces have detained more than 
3,000 people since the Baghdad security plan came into effect, the report 
said.   
  
<P></P>The UN report criticized the Iraqi authorities for failing to guarantee the 
detainees due process rights. It condemned the use of torture and other 
inhumane treatment in detention centers under the authority of the 
Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defense. In total, Iraqi and US 
security forces are holding roughly 37,000 people, many of whom have 
not been charged or sent to trial.   
  
<P></P>"The Iraqi government faces a daunting task to establish law and order," 
Whitson said. "But it can't pretend security is getting better by 
suppressing its own statistics."
