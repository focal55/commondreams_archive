<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>(Washington
– April 6, 2007) Leading international scientists today offered new
hope for fixing the climate problem in a report that says we can avoid
the worst impacts of global warming if we act now to limit greenhouse
gas emissions.</p><p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, the early effects of global warming are happening
faster than most expected and we could cross dangerous tipping points
if emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue
unabated. But the IPCC report suggests the sooner we act, the lower the
risk will be for crossing the line where catastrophic changes become
irreversible.</p><p>"The grim future predicted by the world’s most
respected climate scientists can be avoided if we start now to cut
emissions by about 2 percent a year," said <a href="http://www.environmentaldefense.org/page.cfm?tagID=874" target="_new">Bill Chameides, chief scientist at Environmental Defense</a>.
"The best way to address the climate problem – the only one that
guarantees the reductions we need – is to put a real cap on emissions."</p>
<p>Without
prompt action, the effects of business-as-usual greenhouse gas
emissions will threaten billions of people worldwide, IPCC said today.
The longer we wait, the sharper the cuts will have to be, adding not
only economic strains, but also reducing the likelihood that we will be
successful. </p><p>According to the IPCC, the effects of inaction could include: </p><ul><li><font size="2">More deaths, disease, and injury from heat waves, storms, and droughts </font></li><li><font size="2">Increased flooding in heavily populated coastal areas </font></li><li><font size="2">Food and water shortages for hundreds of millions of people </font></li><li><font size="2">Extinction of up to 30 percent of species globally </font></li></ul><p>Experts
say a temperature increase of just one degree Fahrenheit over the
warming expected from the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere
could take us to the tipping point. Those same experts say we can help
avoid crossing that threshold by cutting U.S. emissions by about 80
percent from current levels by 2050.</p><p>Environmental Defense is
urging the U.S. Congress to create a cap-and-trade system for carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases, an approach that sets enforceable
emissions reduction requirements and lets companies and the market find
the most effective and efficient ways to meet them.</p><p>"If Congress
unleashes the cash and creativity of the private sector with a
cap-and-trade system, America can lead the world in a low-carbon
technology revolution to meet the climate challenge," said <a href="http://www.environmentaldefense.org/page.cfm?tagID=870" target="_new">Environmental Defense President Fred Krupp</a>.</p>
