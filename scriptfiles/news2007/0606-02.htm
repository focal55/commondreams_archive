<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 6 - ICAHD-USA (The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions – USA) announces its new non-violent direct action Constructing Peace Campaign.  In marking 40 years of the Israeli Occupation, ICAHD-USA plans to rebuild the home of every Palestinian family whose house is demolished by the Israeli government.  

<P></P>“The unprecedented scale of this reconstruction effort is intended to raise awareness here and abroad about the devastating realities of Israel’s Occupation of the Palestinian Territories, and to positively pressure the Israeli government to end their inhumane policy of house demolitions,” says Tom Stern, ICAHD-USA Board Chair.

<P></P>The project will begin formally on June 11, 2007, 40 years after the end of the 1967 June War when Israel began its illegal occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.  

<P></P>The demolition of Palestinian homes represents one of the most devastating acts of an occupation that has shattered the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.  Since 1967 Israel has destroyed more than 18,000 family homes in direct contravention of universal human rights standards and treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Times of War and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  As Salim Shawamreh, a Palestinian father who lost his family home, stated: “The demolition of a house means the demolition of a family.”  

<P></P>ICAHD-USA points out that the purpose of Israel’s home demolition policy is to dispossess Palestinians from their own land in order to (1) make room for expanding Israeli settlements; (2) construct a 26-foot high “separation barrier” that cuts deep into Palestinian territory in order to annex these illegal settlements into Israel; (3) create a network of Israeli-only bypass roads to move settlers throughout the West Bank; and (4) to "thin" Jerusalem of its Palestinian inhabitants in order to maintain a Jewish majority.

<P></P>We ask that you join ICAHD-USA in challenging Israel’s unlawful practices in order to re-build bridges toward peace and meaningful negotiations.  We believe that the US public wants a just peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.  It can begin with your help.
