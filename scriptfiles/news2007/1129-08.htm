<p>NEW YORK - November 29 - More than 65 dairy farmers, consumer, farm and agricultural, public health, animal protection and environmental organizations, food processors and retailers today wrote to Pennsylvania Governor Edward G. Rendell to protest the recent Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) action which would prohibit state farmers from telling consumers that they aren’t using artificial hormones on their dairy cows. A copy of the letter can be found here:
http://www.consumersunion.org/campaigns//notinmyfood/005230indiv.html
<p></p>
In late October, PDA informed 16 dairies that they cannot use certain labels on milk, including “Our farmers’ pledge: no artificial growth hormones,” “From cows not treated with the growth hormone rBST,” and “free of artificial growth hormones.” The ban on using these labels will go into effect on February 1, 2008.
<p></p>
“The PDA action interferes with consumers’ right-to-know about the foods they eat,” said Joseph Mendelson, Legal Director at the Washington, DC-based Center for Food Safety. “Many consumers prefer to buy milk produced by cows not treated with artificial hormones, as evidenced by the success in stores across the country of such milk.”
<p></p>
"This infringes on our rights to free speech. We are proud of the fact that we don't use synthetic hormones on our cows and we want to be able to let our customers know about this," said Kim Seeley, proprietor of Milky Way Farms in Troy, PA.
<p></p>
PDA’s action contradicts long established federal policy on this matter. In 1994, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of Monsanto’s recombinant bovine growth hormone (also known as rbGH or rBST), the FDA also said that the following label statement, in proper context, is acceptable: “from cows not treated with rBST.” Earlier this year, Monsanto asked FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to declare these labels to be misleading. In late August, the FTC wrote to Monsanto, “The FTC staff agrees with FDA that food companies may inform consumers in advertising, as in labeling, that they do not use rBST.”
<p></p>
“Since the FDA's controversial decision to approve the use of rbGH, questions have only grown about its safety for humans,” said Dr. Michael Hansen, Senior Scientist for Food Safety for Consumers Union, nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports. “Consumers should have the ability to buy milk from untreated cows if they want to.”
<p></p>
“Pennsylvania has many smaller dairy farms where the use of more natural farming methods and specialty labeling is an essential part of their economic success,” said Brian Snyder, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture (PASA). “Consumers are becoming more interested in understanding and responding to how their food is produced. The PDA shouldn’t prohibit them from talking about these things.”
<p></p>
“We urge the state of Pennsylvania to rescind this poorly conceived policy which interferes with the rights of farmers, dairies and consumers and constitutes inappropriate government interference in the marketplace,” said Ronnie Cummins, National Director, Organic Consumers Association. “This new policy on part of PDA was issued with no opportunity for comment or input from consumers, dairy farmers, processors or the general public, and as such, is a violation of basic democratic process.”
