<p>WASHINGTON - August 28 -  The following is the statement of Kathleen Stoll, Health Policy Director of Families USA, about the Census Bureau's newly released findings that the number of uninsured Americans rose to 47.0 million during 2006:
<P></P>
“We are appalled, but not surprised to see that the number of people without health insurance continues to grow. Under the Bush Administration we have seen the number of uninsured Americans go from 39.8 million (14.1%) in 2001* to 47.0 million (15.8%) by the end of 2006. Yet, the Administration has taken no constructive action to address the problem.
<P></P>
“The huge number of uninsured Americans exceeds the cumulative population of 24 states plus the District of Columbia.¹ [See attached map.] This epidemic of uninsurance has reached crisis proportions, and Americans want to see the problem solved. Fortunately, Congress is taking a big step forward in its effort to renew and strengthen the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) this year.
<P></P>
“The data released today underscore the critical role that public programs such as Medicaid and SCHIP play in providing a health care safety net for millions of Americans. Despite SCHIP's earlier success in decreasing the number of uninsured children, their numbers have risen for the second straight year because of a decline in employer-based coverage.
<P></P>
"Today census numbers only confirm what state officials and health care advocates have seen first-hand — SCHIP resources must be increased to meet the health care needs of the increasing number of uninsured children. Congress is currently working to reauthorize the SCHIP program with enough funding to ensure that as many as 5 million uninsured kids in this country get the coverage they so desperately need.
<P></P>
“Unfortunately, President Bush is poised to move in the wrong direction: Instead of finding solutions for the millions of uninsured children, he continues with the threat of a Presidential veto. President Bush should stop playing politics with the healthcare of millions of children and help Congress in their efforts to reduce the number of uninsured.â??
<P></P>
*The health insurance coverage estimates released by the Census Bureau in August 2006 were revised in March of this year when an error was found in the calculations. Because of this error, estimates from 1999 to through 2005 were changed. The 2001 estimate was changed from 41.2 million to 39.8 million. The 2005 estimate was changed from 46.6 million to 44.8 million.
