<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 29 - The Campaign to Defend the Constitution (DefCon) has been at the forefront of efforts this weekend to expose the real intention of the $27 million “Creation Museum” built by the religious right organization Answers in Genesis (AIG): to institutionalize the lie that science supports the notion of a 6,000 year old Earth.

 

<P></P>DefCon’s efforts highlight how AIG’s pseudo-science endangers our nation’s children and America’s ability to compete in a high-tech global economy. While AIG has every right to build a theme park that shows humans living with dinosaurs, DefCon members have mobilized against this clear marketing ploy designed to confuse children and create controversies where none exist.

 

<P></P>DefCon’s national campaign has:

 

<P></P>1)      Mobilized more than 23,000 Americans to sign two petitions, one for educators and one for citizens, condemning AIG for its attempt to promote a lie and urging the religious right to cease their war on science education. The petition for national educators has been signed by over 4,300 teachers and professors from all 50 states, while the petition for concerned citizens, has been signed by an additional 19,000 Americans. Both petitions can be viewed at http://www.defconamerica.org/creationmuseum/;

<P></P>2)      Demanded that Presidential Candidates clarify their position on the “Creation Museum” through a letter sent from DefCon Media Fund – the (c)(4) arm of DefCon – urging candidates to clearly state where they stand on the “museum,” evolution and our nation’s commitment to science education;

<P></P>3)      Flew a plane banner flown over the “Creation Museum” on May 26th and May 28th, reading “DEFCON SAYS THOU SHALT NOT LIE”;

<P></P>4)      Launched a website dedicated to exposing AIG’s falsehoods as well as encouraging Americans to join our campaign to oppose this war on science. The centerpiece of the site is the “Top 10 Reasons the Earth is Not 6,000 Years Old,” a report prepared by DefCon advisory board member and noted astrophysicist Lawrence Krauss. View the website here: http://www.defconamerica.org/creationmuseum/.

<P></P>5)      Activated 7,000 local DefCon Members to take part in Monday’s “Rally For Reason” outside the “Museum’s” opening.

 

<P></P>The Campaign to Defend the Constitution is a 125,000 member strong online organization dedicated to confronting the growing influence of the religious right and their war on freedom, scientific progress, and American democracy. 

 

<P></P>For comment from any of DefCon’s spokespeople regarding any of the activities above or questions about the campaign please contact Timi Gerson at 202-360-7801.
