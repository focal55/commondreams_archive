<p>WASHINGTON - May 8 - 			Leading reporters and editors from
Business Week, Chemical &amp; Engineering News, GreenBiz.com, The National
Journal, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal will evaluate key
issues and trends in the evolution of sustainable development.  The
discussion will occur at the World Environment Center’s "Colloquium on
Media Reporting of Sustainable Development" on May 11, 2007 at the
National Press Club.  <br>

<br>
The Colloquium will focus on three aspects of sustainable development: 
elements of a sustainability story; evaluation of standards for evaluating
information from national governments, industry and non-government
organizations; and key sustainability drivers and trends.<br>
<br>
Following the media Colloquium, Dr. Daniel C. Esty, Director of the Yale
Center for Environmental Law and Policy, will discuss the evolution of
corporate strategies to innovate, create value and build competitive
advantage that are featured in his new book, Green to Gold.<br>
<br>
"Our global future is increasingly shaped by the ideas developed by
creative scholars and reported by leading journalists," states Dr. Terry
F. Yosie, WEC President &amp; CEO.  "Converting good ideas into practice is
part of the mission of the World Environment Center."<br>
