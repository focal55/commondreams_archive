<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 11 - The Bush Administration is once again playing the "fear card" as Congress continues to debate how to get out of Iraq.</p>

<p align="left">"This Administration is drumming up fear in order to protect its war agenda," said Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH). </p>

<p align="left">News reports over the last two days claim: </p>

<p><font face="Symbol">·<font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font> "New intelligence suggests an Al Qaeda cell may be in the United States or on its way."&nbsp;-'Sources' tell<i> ABC News</i>, July 10, 2007 </p>
<p><font face="Symbol">·<font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font> "U.S. counterterror officials are warning of an increased risk of an attack this summer, given al-Qaida's apparent interest in summertime strikes and increased al-Qaida training in the Afghan-Pakistani border region. On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the editorial board of<i> The Chicago Tribune</i> that he had a "gut feeling" about a new period of increased risk." -<i>Associated Press</i>, July 11, 2007</p>

<p><font face="Symbol">·<font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font> "Fearing complacency among the American people over possible terror threats, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said...that the nation faces a heightened chance of an attack this summer. 'We could easily be attacked,' Chertoff added. 'The intent to attack us remains as strong as it was on Sept. 10, 2001.'" -<i>The</i><i> Chicago Tribune</i>, July 11, 2007</p>
<p align="left">"The Administration is desperately seeking support for its failed war strategy. 'Anonymous sources,' 'gut feelings,' what does all of this add up to? Throughout the early stages of the Iraq war a strategy of deception led by the Lincoln and the Rendon groups was used to create fear and more war. No evidence has been made public to suggest an attack on the United States this summer, just as there was no evidence that Iraq was harboring Weapons of Mass Destruction.</p>

<p align="left">"Yesterday the President asked Congress for additional time before passing judgment on his Iraq war strategy. The President is on a mission: To get more money for his war. Congress must also be held accountable and not fall into the Administration's trap. We do not have to fund the war.&nbsp;We have the money to bring the troops home.&nbsp;<b><u> It does not require a vote.</u></b>&nbsp;It requires determination and truth,"&nbsp;Kucinich concluded.</p>
