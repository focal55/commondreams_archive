<p>MARSHALL, CALIFORNIA - December 6 - If the organizers of the Second Annual Synchronized GlobalOrgasm for Peace have their way, at the precise moment when the sun reaches its most southerly point on the globe (6:08 a.m. GMT on Saturday December 22, 2007), they hope to have convinced one-third of the planet's population to have a peak experience while concentrating on Peace.
<p></p>
"It may take some practice to hone the skill of visualizing a peaceful world while we're so deeply involved in ourselves," says Paul Reffell, one of the organizers. "That's why we give everyone plenty of advance notice."
 <p></p>
The theory is that if enough people can climax at the same time while projecting a conscious intention for peace and harmony on the planet, a surge of physical and spiritual positivity will infuse the Earth's energy field. The organizers think that surge will create a different kind of global warming – the warming feeling of love and harmony and an aversion to violence. "It's the only good thing about having too many people on the planet, what with over-population causing 'Peak Everything'". says Reffell. "For the Global-O, the more the merrier."
 
<p></p>
The inspiration came from hearing about The Global Consciousness Project in Princeton, NJ (<a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu" target="_new">http://noosphere.princeton.edu</a>), which runs a network of Random Event Generators around the world that record changes in their randomness during global events. The results show that human consciousness can be measured to have a global effect on matter and energy during widely-watched events such as the World Trade Center collapse, large antiwar protests, natural catastrophes, acts of war and mass meditations. Concentrated consciousness has measurable effects, and the Global-O aims to go off the scale.
 <p></p>
The Global-O 2007 has a truly international flair and a challenge for its participants. This year, the website was designed by Globulart, <a href="http://www.globulart.com" target="_new">www.globulart.com</a>, a design company in Almería, Spain, partly to honor the country whose capital city, Madrid, scored the greatest number of visits to the website on The Day in 2006. The contest is called The Human Race for Peace, and the organizers will be counting visitors to see which country scores the highest.
 <p></p>
In 2006, the fledgling movement focused on escalating tensions between the governments of the USA and Iran. The saber-rattling continues, as do other effects of over-population and over-consumption, like global warming, genocide, war and the daily avalanche of bad news. "It's time for a Global Giggle, especially one that might make a change in the way we feel about each other," says Reffell.
 <p></p>
The Global-O organizers hope to foster the kind of interconnection that can most easily be felt during simultaneous orgasm, only on a planetary scale. Interconnection of everyone's male and female traits is also important to them. " True partnership between the Masculine and Feminine that is within all women and men may enable our species to survive in relative harmony. The GlobalOrgasm for Peace is one attempt to begin that process," said Reffell. <!-- #EndEditable -->
