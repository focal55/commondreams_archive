<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 29 - Liam Madden, the
Iraq War veteran who claimed
the military attack on Iraq
was “an illegal war of aggression under Nuremberg
principles” and that “war crimes were being committed in Iraq,”
received
word today that the Marines have dropped the charges against him rather
than
provide a forum for these issues to be debated.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Marines had claimed his comments were “disloyal” and
threatened to
reduce his discharge from honorable to less than honorable.</p>
<p>“I planned to argue that my comments were accurate
and
therefore not disloyal.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, it is
the duty of veterans and active duty members of the military to stand
up and
tell their leaders when war crimes are being committed,” said Madden.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Now that the military has chickened out and
dropped these charges I hope others will join me in speaking out
against this
illegal war.”</p>
<p>The Marines offered to drop the charges against
Madden if he
agreed to not wear his uniform at demonstrations.<span>&nbsp; </span>Liam
responded that he would agree to that
only if the Marines agreed that his comments about the war being
illegal were
not disloyal because they were accurate. His response to the Marines is
below. </p>
<p>“The dropping of charges in my case should be a
signal to
all vets that they can speak out.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Marine
Corps fear of holding a disciplinary hearing is an admission that my
comments
were accurate.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the Marines had moved
forward to discipline me I would have brought forward leading legal
scholars,
military law experts and historians to demonstrate conclusively that
the United
States is now engaged in an illegal war of aggression under
international law
and therefore all acts being taken are war crimes,” said Madden.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>Madden is currently on tour with fellow vets going
to military
bases to reach out to active duty troops and urge them to get involved
in
efforts to end the war.<span>&nbsp; </span>“The reception
we are receiving is remarkable.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is
no doubt that more and more troops are coming to the conclusion that
this war
is wrong and are ready to speak out.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, under international law all acts taken in an illegal war
of
aggression are considered war crimes,” noted Madden.</p>
<p>Madden can be reached while he is on the road for
interviews.<span>&nbsp; </span>His number is 703-408-3626.</p>

<p>Liam Madden’s response to the Marines</p>
<p>June 25, 2007</p>
<p>Lt
Col Blessing,</p>
<p>This letter is in response to the offer the Marine
Corps
Mobilization Command relayed to me via my military appointed attorney.
I am
prepared to accept the settlement proposed in which the Marine Corps
agrees not
to continue with the discharge proceeding regarding my alleged disloyal
statements and protest activity. I understand that this is contingent
on my
oral promise not to engage in further political protest while wearing
articles
of my Marine uniform.</p>
<p>I will make such an oral agreement and stand by my
good word
if the Marine Corps is prepared to meet the following condition. </p>
<p>I will orally agree to not wear my military
uniforms while
engaged in any political protest, hell, I’ll have it carved into stone
if you’d
like, upon receiving a signed, written statement on official USMC
letterhead
acknowledging that my statements in question were neither disloyal nor
inaccurate. If the Marine Corps issues this statement, apologizing for
erroneously (or possibly vindictively) accusing me of disloyalty to my
country,
I will not share it with another living soul.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>I believe that the statements I make and the
protest I
engage in is necessary. If it’s not true that the war in Iraq
is illegal, then I believe it
would be indeed disloyal to declare such a position. However, the fact
of the
matter is that the United
States is violating the sovereignty of
another nation without the approval of the UN Security Council or a
legitimate
claim to self defense. Sir, is honesty disloyalty? </p>
<p>Additionally, if it isn’t true, I would hope the
US
Government would prove to the skeptical world that the war is legal
instead, of
trying to stifle political opposition. I am sure we can agree that
protesting
against an illegal war, premised on lies and baseless assertions cannot
be
considered disloyal.</p>

<p>If the Marine Corps decides to not accept this
condition,
then I cannot agree to stop wearing my uniform at protests and we must
continue
to exhaust my legal alternatives. Which at present, include my right to
an
administrative board and may ultimately result in a case in federal
appeals
court.</p>
<p>I assure you, as a fellow patriot, my actions are
taken in
the best interest of the American people and the people of the world.
Therefore, if the Marines decide to stop pursuing this case, I will
accept that
measure as your implied tolerance and support of protesting against war
crimes
while wearing military uniforms.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my counter offer and I
hope we can
come to agreement on the matter. I understand men in your position have
their
careers to think about, as I’m positive many German Colonels did in
1939.</p>
<p>Semper Fidelis,<br>
Liam Madden<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
