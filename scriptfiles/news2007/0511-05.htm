<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - Free Press pledged support for the bipartisan "Internet Radio Equality Act of 2007," introduced Thursday by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) to rescue Internet radio. This important legislation would vacate a ruling by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) that threatens to put Internet radio out of business by dramatically increasing the fees webcasters must pay to stream a song online. A companion bill (H.R. 2060) was introduced in the House by Reps. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) and Don Manzullo (R-Ill.) in late April.<br><br>Free Press Associate Policy Director Frannie Wellings issued the following statement:<br><br>"Free Press applauds Senators Wyden and Brownback for their leadership on this important issue and urges both the Senate and the House to move quickly to pass the Internet Radio Equality Act. This bill establishes fair rates that both compensate artists and maximize the number of places where consumers can find new music.<br><br>"The CRB ignored massive public outcry to push forward this disastrous royalty rate hike. The new rates fail to distinguish noncommercial webcasting as a unique service and create an unmanageable rate-hike for everyone streaming music online — noncommercial webcasters, small upstarts and even the largest commercial companies. This bill recognizes that nonprofit webcasters like NPR should not be forced to pay so much money that they actually fear an increase in their listenership. And it sets a reasonable, balanced rate for everyone.<br><br>"Internet radio has become the destination for independent artists shut out of mainstream radio to find an audience for their music. And it allows music lovers to bypass cookie-cutter programming and listen to a wide array of musical genres and artists no longer found on the commercial radio dial. The Internet Radio Equality Act preserves musical diversity online, ensuring that artists and musicians thrive alongside a new generation of Internet radio webcasters."<br>
