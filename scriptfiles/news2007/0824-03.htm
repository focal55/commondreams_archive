<p>WASHINGTON - August 24 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called the first anniversary of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of over-the-counter sales of the emergency contraceptive Plan B® a reminder of the triumph for women's health over political ideology. For more than three years, the Bush administration interfered in the FDA-approval process, overriding the judgment of the agency's scientific and medical experts and denying women better access to this safe and effective form of back-up birth control. </p>

<p>Keenan cautioned that while the FDA's decision, which was announced on August 24, 2006, marked a major step forward, many women still do not have access to emergency contraception (EC). As such, NARAL Pro-Choice America is mobilizing its activists across the country in the Plan B. Where's Yours? campaign – an effort to educate women about the medication's availability and pressure national pharmacy chains to adopt policies requiring their stores to stock Plan B®. (For more information about <em>Plan B. Where's Yours?</em> <a href="/choice-action-center/take-action/plan-b/">please click here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Today's anniversary reminds us all that more needs to be done to ensure that women across the country have access to this safe, effective form of back-up birth control. Unfortunately, anti-choice pharmacists continue to block women's access to emergency contraception and national pharmacy chains refuse to adopt policies informing customers of their right to obtain this medication," Keenan said.</p>
<p>Already NARAL Pro-Choice America's volunteer-led surveys have identified pharmacies across the country that do not stock Plan B® and individual pharmacists who refuse to dispense it. Two women who were denied Plan B® at their local pharmacies have spoken out about their experiences and have joined NARAL Pro-Choice America to call on national pharmacy chains to end this discriminatory practice.</p>
<p>"Anti-choice groups and their allies are doing everything they can to block access to this safe and effective birth-control option," Keenan said. "And unfortunately, the FDA's approval of over-the-counter distribution of Plan B® has not stopped rogue pharmacists from infringing upon the rights of women."</p>
<p>Keenan also praised lawmakers at the state and federal levels who are considering legislation to improve women's access to Plan B®. Five states – Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, &nbsp;Oregon, and Minnesota – have enacted laws this year that, among other things, ensure rape survivors' access to EC-related information in hospital emergency rooms.</i></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
