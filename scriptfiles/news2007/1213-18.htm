<p>WASHINGTON - December 13 -- The American Civil Liberties Union today sent a detailed 
12-page letter to all members of Congress urging them to demand that Attorney 
General Mukasey appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute 
any violations of federal criminal laws related to the interrogation of 
detainees, including any obstruction of justice. </p>
<p>The letter outlines ten reasons why the Senate should ask for an independent 
prosecutor. They are:</p>

<dir>
<dir>
<ol></ol></dir></dir><ol><li><p>There is credible evidence of numerous federal crimes</p></li><li><p>Attempts to shield government officials from criminal prosecution were 
pursued by the White House, including by the president and vice president</p></li><li><p>Attorney General Mukasey still refuses to say whether waterboarding and other 
forms of torture are illegal</p></li><li><p>The current head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department was in 
meetings on interrogations</p></li><li><p>The past head of the Criminal Division reportedly advised on interrogation 
practices, possibly including the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah</p></li><li><p>The Justice Department wrote the legal opinions authorizing torture</p></li><li><p>The Justice Department has failed to bring any indictments based on twenty 
CIA and DOD referrals of possible crimes by civilians</p></li><li><p>Military prosecutors have not gone up the chain of command</p></li><li><p>Further delay in criminal investigations could put some crimes outside the 
statutes of limitation</p></li><li><p>Congress and the agencies have failed in holding torture perpetrators 
accountable</p></li></ol><p>"These tapes were sought by courts, Congress and the 9/11 Commission, and 
their destruction raises serious concerns of criminal obstruction of justice. 
But the tapes depicted far more serious criminal activity," said Caroline 
Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "Limiting an 
independent prosecutor solely to any misconduct in the destruction of the tapes 
<font face="Times New Roman">could end up being a further miscarriage of 
justice.</font>" </p>
<p>Christopher Anders, senior legislative counsel with the ACLU said, 
"Prosecutors should look beyond these videotapes and investigate the bigger 
problem of roughly six years of unpunished torture crimes. The range of alleged 
crimes is breathtaking in its scope, from obstruction of justice to torture to 
homicide. But because the torture program involved top officials in the White 
House, CIA, Justice Department, and Defense Department, only an independent 
prosecutor who can act outside the influence and control of this Administration 
can be trusted."</p>
