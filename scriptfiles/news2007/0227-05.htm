<p>WASHINGTON - February 27 - The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) yesterday filed an amicus
brief in a critically important consumer case in the Supreme Court1 that, if wrongly decided, could dramatically
raise consumer prices and undermine important innovations in retailing.
<p>Dr. Mark Cooper, CFA’s Director of Research, issued the following statement explaining why this case
is important to consumers:
<p>In this case, a manufacturer of luxury goods is asking the Supreme Court to overturn the ban on retail
price maintenance (RPM). This ban prevents manufacturers from setting minimum prices and allows
discounters to offer products to the public at whatever price they choose. RPM has been illegal under the
antitrust laws for over a century. The result has been to foster innovation and discounting in marketing and
distribution. When employed, RPM prevents consumers from “shopping around” for the best price because it
prevents retailers from putting on sale any and all types of products, including not only large purchases, but also
everyday purchases—from groceries to gasoline. Because of this rule, consumers have saved hundreds of
billions of dollars over the years, while the retailing industry has progressed from small shops to department
stores to discount warehouses to, most recently, Internet distribution.
<p>Decades ago, America experimented with “fair trade” laws, which legalized RPM for a time. These
laws invariably led to anticompetitive practices and raised prices. Over 30 years ago, Congress adopted
legislation to ban this practice in order to combat inflation and provide lower prices for consumers. Now,
manufacturers are asking the courts to overturn the clear will of Congress based on bogus economic theories
that have been thoroughly discredited in both the academic literature and in real world markets.
The Appeals Court saw through the arguments of the manufacturers and rejected them. The Supreme
Court should do the same. There are no constitutional, legal or economic grounds for the Supreme Court to
ignore the express will of Congress at the expense of the American consumer.
<p>This case is a dagger aimed at the heart of the most consumer-friendly aspects of the Internet. The
Internet has shifted power to the consumer in two ways. First, it allows consumers to search for and gather
information in a cost-effective, efficient manner. Second, it provides a low-cost means of retailing, making it
easy for discounters to offer products to the public. This combination squeezes excess profits and inefficiencies
out of product prices. Retail price maintenance is a last ditch effort by big business to short circuit this
extremely consumer friendly process. By setting minimum prices, manufacturers can build in excess margins
for themselves and for their favored retailers – prices that consumers have no choice but to pay.<!-- #EndEditable -->
