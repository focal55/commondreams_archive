<p>WASHINGTON - November 6 -<i>The Politico</i> <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/05/politics/politico/thecrypt/main3452852.shtml">reports</a>: "Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) plans to take to the floor of the House Tuesday and introduce a privileged resolution to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney. The privilege approach allows him to circumvent Democratic leadership, which opposes voting on the measure.<br>
<br>
<br>
"His resolution will be met with a motion to table it. A vote against the motion will be a vote in favor of impeaching Cheney ...<br>
<br>
<br>

"An American Research Group poll this summer found more than half of Americans support his impeachment.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Regardless, the measure is expected to fail by a wide margin."<br>
<br>
<br>
The following analysts and activists are available for interviews:<br>

<br>
<b><a href="mailto:Libertad48@san.rr.com">MARJORIE COHN</a></b><br>
Cohn is the author of the new book <i>Cowboy Republic: Six Ways the Bush Gang Has Defied the Law</i>. She is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild. Cohn said today: "The war of aggression in Iraq, the secret prisons, the use of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, the use of evidence obtained by torture, and the surveillance of citizens without warrants, all initiated and carried out under the tenure of Bush and Cheney, are illegal under the U.S. Constitution and international law."<br>

<b><a href="mailto:bruce@thelichfieldgroup.com">BRUCE FEIN</a></b><br>
Available for a limited number of interviews, Fein was a Justice Department attorney in the Nixon administration. In June 1998 he helped write the articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton. He wrote the piece "<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2169292">Impeach Cheney: The vice president has run utterly amok and must be stopped</a>." <br>
<br>
Fein said today: "The Founding Fathers expected an executive to try to overreach and expected the executive would be hampered and curtailed by the legislative branch. But the legislature is walking away from its responsibility to oversee and check the executive. Impeachment is not an option for lawmakers -- it's an obligation when they take that oath to faithfully uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Impeachment is part of the Constitution and for Pelosi or anyone else to 'take it off the table' is itself an unconstitutional act."<br>
<br>
Fein is a constitutional lawyer at Bruce Fein &amp; Associates and chairman of the American Freedom Agenda. He is author of the forthcoming book <i>Constitutional Peril: The Life and Death Struggle Over the Constitution and Democracy</i>. Fein is retained counsel for Ron Paul's presidential campaign only on ballot access issues.<br>

<b><a href="mailto:david@davidswanson.org">DAVID SWANSON</a></b><br>
Creator of <a href="http://ImpeachCheney.org">ImpeachCheney.org</a>, Swanson said today: "The majority of Americans want Cheney impeached, while the majority of Congress members and Washington insiders refuse to consider the idea. Perhaps they're too busy exporting 'democracy.' Or maybe they're too busy passing bills and writing letters, pretending not to know that any progressive bills will be vetoed, and a letter asking Bush not to launch another war of aggression won't even be read. Citizens have the power to write letters. The Constitution gave the Congress the power of impeachment. Nothing else will halt the Bush-Cheney war agenda."<br>

<br>
<b><a href="mailto:dlindorff@yahoo.com">DAVID LINDORFF</a></b><br>
Lindorff is co-author of the book <i>The Case for Impeachment: The Legal Argument for Removing President George W. Bush from Office</i>. He said today: "Cheney has violated the Nuremberg Charter by threatening to attack a country (Iran) that poses no imminent threat to the U.S. This is an easily proven and clearly illegal action."<br>
