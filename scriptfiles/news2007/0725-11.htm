<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 25 - –  Today, by a vote of 399-24, the House passed legislation introduced by Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) to prevent permanent military bases in Iraq and bar U.S. control over Iraqi oil resources.

<P></P>Lee’s bill, H.R. 2929, declares that it is the policy of the United States not to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq and not to exercise United States control of the oil resources of Iraq and prohibits the use of funds for these purposes.

<P></P>The following is Congresswoman Lee’s statement from the House floor: 

<P></P>“What this legislation does is simple.  It does what the Iraq Study Group and other experts have recommended that we do.  It makes a clear statement of policy that the U.S. does not intend to maintain an open ended military presence in Iraq and that we won’t exercise control over Iraqi oil, and it backs that policy up with the power of the purse.

<P></P>“Putting Congress on record with this clear statement helps take the targets off our troops’ backs and it support our goals of handing over responsibility for security and public safety to Iraqi forces.

<P></P>“Mr. Speaker, the perception that the United States plans to maintain a permanent military presence in Iraq strengthens the insurgency and it fuels the violence against our troops.

<P></P>“That is why experts ranging from former advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority, Larry Diamond to the Iraq Study Group have called on the President to make a clear statement of policy that the U.S. does not intend to maintain permanent military bases or an open-ended military presence in Iraq.

<P></P>“Unfortunately, the administration has refused to do that.  In fact, there are conflicting accounts as to who will decide if we stay in Iraq permanently.  When the president was asked that question at a press conference last October, he said, ‘Any decisions on permanency in Iraq will be made by the Iraqi government.’  But when Secretary Gates was asked ‘is our presence left up to the Iraqis or do we make the decision?’ in testimony before the Senate this February, Secretary Gates said, ‘We will make that decision, sir.’

<P></P>“More recently, the administration has further muddied the waters by saying that they envision a United States military presence in Iraq similar to that ‘we have in South Korea,’ where American troops have been stationed for more than 50 years, and won’t be leaving any time soon.

<P></P>“We must soundly reject the vision of an open ended occupation as bad policy that undermines the safety of our troops and recognize it for what it is: another recruiting poster for terrorists.

<P></P>“To those who raise objections or want to suggest that this is only a symbolic measure or raise semantic questions about what a ‘permanent base’ is, let me say this:

<P></P>“This is a serious issue, and I think we all recognize how much is at stake.  The question is simple: do we support an endless occupation, or do we oppose it?

<P></P>“We may disagree on many things about Iraq, but I hope we can agree that that an endless occupation is not the answer.  Let’s make that commitment today.  Let’s put the so-called Korea-model to bed.  Let’s tell our troops that when they come home, they will all come home.  Let’s pass this legislation.”

<P></P>
Lee, who first introduced legislation to bar permanent bases in June, 2005, has led efforts to attach base related amendments to spending and authorization bills.  The House passed Lee’s amendment barring permanent bases to the FY06 Iraq supplemental, but it was stripped out of the bill in conference committee.  Subsequently, Congress passed amendments to the FY07 Defense Authorization bill, Defense Appropriations bill and Iraq supplemental, all of which became law.  This year the House has passed similar amendments for the Fy08 Defense Authorization bill and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.<!-- #EndEditable -->
