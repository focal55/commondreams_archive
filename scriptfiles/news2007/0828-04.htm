<p>WASHINGTON - August 28 - According to KTVB-TV in Boise, Idaho, U.S. Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho) was arrested in June at a Minnesota airport by a plainclothes police officer investigating lewd conduct complaints in a men's public restroom. On Aug. 8, Craig reportedly pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct in the Hennepin County District Court and paid more than $500 in fines and fees, and a 10-day jail sentence was stayed.</p>

<p align="left">Craig, who is married, supported both the Federal Marriage Amendment and Idaho’s anti-same-sex marriage constitutional amendment. He does not support nondiscrimination and hate crimes legislation that would extend protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and has refused to pledge that his own office would not discriminate against LGBT people.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director<br>

National Gay and Lesbian Task Force</strong></p>

<p>“What’s up with elected officials like Senator Craig? They stand for so-called ‘family values’ and fight basic protections for gay people while furtively seeking other men for sex. Infuriating pathetic hypocrites. What more can you say?</p>

<p>“There is sad irony that a United States senator from Idaho has been caught up in the same kind of thing that destroyed the lives of dozens of men in Boise in the 1950s, so tragically chronicled in ‘Boys of Boise.’</p>

<p>“And by the way, why are Minneapolis tax dollars being used to have plainclothes police officers lurking idly in airport restroom stalls?”</p>

<p align="left"><i>The mission of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is to build the grassroots power of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. We do this by training activists, equipping state and local organizations with the skills needed to organize broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation, and building the organizational capacity of our movement. Our Policy Institute, the movement’s premier think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality and to counter right-wing lies. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a nation that respects the diversity of human expression and identity and creates opportunity for all. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Cambridge. </i></p>
