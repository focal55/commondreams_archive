<p>WASHINGTON - August 23 - Iraq War Veteran Evan Knappenberger, 1st BDE, 4th Infantry Division, will maintain an ongoing vigil on a 6' scaffold on the Mall in Washington, DC as part of a weeklong Tower Guard vigil beginning Sunday, August 26th through Saturday, September 1st.

<P></P>Knappenberger will hold his 7-day, 24-hour vigil adjacent to the Washington Monument on the National Mall. He will set up the tower between Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive and 14th and 15th Streets, NW. This action, supported by various organizations including the Washington Peace Center, Iraq Veterans Against the War, and Whatcom Peace & Justice Center, follows a successful 8-day/7-night Tower Guard in Bellingham, WA that garnered extensive media coverage from the AP; all major  Seattle TV news networks; Democracy Now! and Air America.

<P></P>Knappenberger is drawing attention to the US military's STOP-LOSS and INACTIVE RESERVE policies, which he submits are being used as a substitute for conscription in a political war.  "I spent a year in Iraq. I pulled 97 nights on tower guard," explained the 22 year-old intelligence veteran. "Many of the friends I served with have completed their Active Duty contracts. Now, they're being sent back to Iraq for their third or fourth tours. Tours have been extended from 12 months to up to 18 months. Some soldiers are getting called up after living years of civilian life. Stop-loss is an unethical policy."

<P></P>While fulfilling his duties, Knappenberger witnessed the full effect of the administration's policies on military personnel and the Iraqi people, and began to question those policies. He was given a General Discharge under honorable circumstances in April 2007. Now that he is home, he is committed to doing everything he can to represent his fellow soldiers and address the wrongs being done to them and their families.

<P></P>Members of Veterans for Peace have expressed strong support. "Evan's Tower Guard action speaks not only to an unethical, unfair misuse of our military personnel, but to the seemingly endless sacrifices imposed on their families," said Gene Marx, Vietnam Veteran and father of a two-tour Iraq War Veteran. "It was just a matter of time before returning veterans like Evan enlighten our communities."

<P></P>IVAW Chairman Garett Reppenhagen made this statement: "Iraq Veterans Against the War are encouraged by Evan Knappenberger's courage to express his concerns regarding the current Stop-Loss and Individual Ready Reserve. This abuse of the men and women in the Armed Services should not be tolerated by our nation. Thank you, Evan, for finding a bold expression to wake-up America about our responsibility to use our military members honestly and fairly."

<P></P>Knappenberger invites the public to talk with him while he is on Tower Guard to learn more about the unethical Stop-loss policy. His action is part of a month-long campaign of anti-war, pro-veteran protests taking place in Washington, DC and around the US.
