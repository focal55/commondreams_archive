<p>WASHINGTON - December 5 -     The American 
Civil Liberties Union is in court today calling for the release of three 
documents issued by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel 
(OLC) that are believed 
to have authorized the CIA to use extremely harsh interrogation methods. The 
government failed to identify or provide the memos, which were issued in May of 
2005, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by the 
ACLU requesting information on 
U.S. treatment 
and interrogation of detainees. </p>

<p>"This is yet another 
example of the government’s attempt to bypass legal prohibitions on torture and 
while engaging in a cover-up of its illegal conduct," said Amrit 
Singh, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights 
Project.&nbsp; "These memos must 
immediately be released to the public and high level officials must be held 
accountable for their role in spawning torture and prisoner abuse."</p>
<p>The New York Times disclosed the 
existence of the first two memos in a front-page article on October 4, 2007. The Times reported that the first 
memo explicitly authorized interrogators to use combinations of harsh 
interrogation methods including waterboarding, head slapping, and exposure to 
freezing temperatures. The second memo, issued by OLC as Congress prepared to 
enact legislation prohibiting "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment," declared 
that none of the CIA’s interrogation methods violated that standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"Through these memos, the 
Office of Legal Counsel created a legal framework that was specifically intended 
to allow the CIA to violate both 
U.S. and 
international law," said Jameel Jaffer, 
Director of the ACLU’s National Security Project. "It’s clear that these 
documents are being kept secret not for national security reasons but for 
political ones." </p>
<p>The memos, which were 
authored in May of 2005,&nbsp; were not 
included in the government’s response to the ACLU’s FOIA request for all 
documents pertaining to the treatment and interrogation of detainees in 
U.S. custody. 
The government also withheld the documents from key senators during a 
congressional inquiry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The ACLU filed legal 
papers on October 24 objecting to the omission of the two memos and requesting 
their release. In response, the government filed papers that revealed the 
existence of a third memo issued by the OLC pertaining to the treatment of 
detainees by the CIA. The ACLU is in court today requesting the release of all 
three OLC documents.&nbsp; Melanca Clark 
of the New Jersey-based law firm Gibbons P.C., which is co-counsel with the ACLU 
on the FOIA lawsuit, will argue the motion before U.S. District Court Judge 
Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The 
ACLU’s brief requesting production of outstanding documents is online at: 
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32572lgl20071024.html" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32572lgl20071024.html</a></p>
<p>The 
government’s response to the ACLU’s brief is online at:<br><a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32573lgl20071105.html" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32573lgl20071105.html</a></p>
<p>The 
ACLU’s reply in support of the request for production is online at: <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32950lgl20071108.html" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32950lgl20071108.html</a></p>

information on the torture and abuse of detainees in 
U.S. military 
custody and an index of documents received by the ACLU in its FOIA lawsuit is

<p>Many of 
these documents are also contained and summarized in Administration of 
Torture, a recently published book by Jaffer and Singh. More information is 
available online at: <br><a href="http://www.aclu.org/administrationoftorture" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.aclu.org/administrationoftorture</a></p>

are Lawrence S. Lustberg and Melanca D. Clark of the New Jersey-based law firm 
Gibbons P.C.; Jaffer, Singh and Judy Rabinovitz 
of the ACLU; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties 
Union; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional 
Rights.
