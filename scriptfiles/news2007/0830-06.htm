<p>WASHINGTON - August 30 - At a hearing today in federal court, the 
American Civil Liberties Union argued that the 
U.S. government 
cannot deport an Egyptian national back to 
Egypt based on 
"diplomatic assurances" from the Egyptian government that it will not torture 
him upon his return. The ACLU also asked that he be immediately released from 
detention, where he has been held since May. </p>

<p>Sameh Khouzam, a 
Christian who came to the United 
States in 1998 fleeing religious persecution in 
Egypt, was 
granted protection from deportation under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) 
in 2004 after a federal appeals court found that he would likely be tortured if 
sent back to 
Egypt. Despite 
this finding, as well as State Department reports showing that 
Egypt routinely 
engages in torture, the 
U.S. government 
is trying to deport Khouzam to 
Egypt based on 
"diplomatic assurances" the 
U.S. claims to 
have received from the Egyptian government that it asserts are "sufficiently 
reliable" to protect him from torture.</p>
<p>"The 
U.S. government 
is violating its treaty obligations under the Convention Against Torture by 
attempting to deport Mr. Khouzam back to 
Egypt based on 
diplomatic assurances that are inherently unreliable," said 
Amrit Singh, an attorney with the ACLU 
Immigrants' Rights Project. "Sending Mr. Khouzam back to 
Egypt despite 
its record of systemic torture and a court's prior finding that he would likely 
be tortured there is illegal and unconscionable."</p>
<p>Ratified by the 
U.S. in 1994, 
and implemented by domestic legislation, the Convention Against Torture 
prohibits the 
U.S. from 
transferring a person "to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture." The 
U.S. government 
is using "diplomatic assurances" - in Khouzam's case and others - to circumvent 
its treaty obligations, and transferring individuals to countries that provide 
nothing more than unenforceable promises that they will not engage in torture, 
according to the ACLU and other human rights groups. </p>
<p>In Khouzam's case, 
neither he nor his lawyers have seen the Egyptian assurances that are the basis 
for terminating his CAT protection. Nor has the 
U.S. government 
offered any explanation for why these assurances are deemed sufficiently 
reliable to protect Khouzam from torture. Indeed, Khouzam did not receive any 
notice that his CAT protection was being terminated until May 29, when, upon 
appearing for a routine check-in with immigration authorities, he was taken into 
detention and provided with a one-paragraph explanation from Julie Myers, 
Assistant Secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, informing him that 
he could be removed within 72 hours. </p>
<p>"What is most egregious 
about the U.S. government's conduct in this case is its insistence that it need 
not provide any mechanism whatsoever in which Mr. Khouzam can challenge the 
reliability and sufficiency of Egypt's diplomatic assurances," said 
Judy Rabinovitz, a senior attorney with the 
ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. "Especially in light of the severe 
consequences Mr. Khouzam will suffer from an erroneous decision, the 
government's actions here defy fundamental notions of due process to which both 
citizens and non-citizens alike are entitled."</p>
<p>Today's hearing was 
before Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie of the U.S. District Court for the Middle 
District of Pennsylvania, who issued an emergency stay of Khouzam's removal in 
June, shortly after Khouzam was informed that his CAT protection had been 
terminated and his removal imminent. That stay remains in place pending the 
outcome of the court proceedings. The U.S. government, however, has opposed the 
court's involvement in this case, repeatedly arguing that the executive branch 
has unfettered authority to determine that the diplomatic assurances are 
sufficiently reliable to remove Khouzam, and that the federal courts lack 
jurisdiction to review its decision.</p>
<p>"This administration's 
claim that it can send a man to a country where he will almost certainly be 
tortured and that no court has the power to even review the government's actions 
flies in the face of every principle of American law, pre-or post-September 11," 
said Lee Gelernt, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights 
Project. "This administration has consistently attempted to eliminate any 
meaningful role for the courts."</p>
<p>Pending the court's 
decision, Khouzam remains detained in the York County Prison in 
Pennsylvania. When Khouzam first 
came to the U.S. 
in 1998, he was immediately placed in immigration detention based on allegations 
by the Egyptian authorities that he was wanted in 
Egypt on a 
murder charge. Khouzam denies those allegations, and to date, the Egyptian 
authorities have produced little evidence to support this charge. Nonetheless, 
Khouzam was imprisoned by 
U.S. immigration 
authorities for the next six years while he challenged his removal and pursued 
relief under the Convention Against Torture, and for an additional two years 
after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in his favor in 
February 2004. Finally, in February 2006, a federal district court ordered his 
release from detention. Since that time, and prior to his re-detention on May 
29, Khouzam was living and working in 
Pennsylvania as controller of a 
real estate company. A large circle of well-wishers in his church community have 
been advocating to prevent Khouzam's deportation and secure his release. The 
ACLU is asking that the court release Khouzam under reasonable conditions of 
supervision pending a final decision in his case.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department 
has documented widespread Egyptian persecution and discrimination against 
Christians and other religious minorities, as well as widespread use of torture 
in Egypt. A 
State Department report on the matter is available at: <br><a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78851.htm">www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78851.htm</a></p>

<p>Affidavits filed in court 
papers for Khouzam demonstrate that torture and abuse in Egyptian detention 
facilities are routine and 
Egypt has 
breached similar diplomatic assurances in the past. Senator Robert Casey, Jr. 
(D-PA) recently sent a letter to Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff 
supporting Khouzam and denouncing 
Egypt's 
diplomatic assurances. That letter is available at: <br><a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/CaseytoChertoffonKhouzam.pdf">www.aclupa.org/downloads/CaseytoChertoffonKhouzam.pdf</a>. </p><p>Congressman Joseph Pitts (R-PA) also sent a 
letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice requesting Khouzam's deportation 
be cancelled. That letter is available at: <br><a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/29982prs20070604.html">www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/29982prs20070604.html</a></p>
<p>Attorneys representing 
Khouzam are Singh, Rabinovitz, Gelernt and Alice Clapman of the ACLU's 
Immigrants' Rights Project, Vic Walczak and Mary Catherine Roper of the ACLU of 
Pennsylvania, and Morton Sklar of World Organization for Human Rights USA.</p>
