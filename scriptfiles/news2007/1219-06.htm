<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 19 --  Today, Reps. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) and Dave Reichert (R-Wash.) introduced the “Media Ownership Act of 2007” (H.R.4835) – the House companion to a Senate bill (S. 2332) sponsored by Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) and Trent Lott (R-Miss.) — legislation that would overturn disastrous new media rules approved yesterday by the Federal Communications Commission.
<p></p>
In a 3-to-2, party-line vote, the FCC eliminated the longstanding ban on “newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership,” which prohibits a local newspaper from owning a broadcast station in the same market. The “Media Ownership Act” would invalidate this vote for failing to adequately address media diversity and localism — and for not giving the public adequate time to weigh in on proposed changes to ownership rules.
<p></p>
At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing earlier this month, Congressman Inslee chastised FCC Chairman Martin for announcing the Seattle hearing on short notice. He said that Martin treated Seattle residents “like a bunch of chumps” by unveiling his new rules in a New York Times op-ed almost immediately following the hearing. At the public hearing in Seattle, Congressman Reichert said “localism and diversity are the cornerstones of our democratic society.”
<p></p>
<b>Ben Scott</b>, policy director of Free Press, issued the following statement:
<p></p>
“We are encouraged to see members of the House from both sides of the aisle joining their Senate colleagues in standing up for the vast majority of Americans who oppose media consolidation. In the rush to reward Big Media, the FCC has ignored the public will and defied the Congress.
<p></p>
“This crucial legislation would reverse the FCC’s actions, fix the broken policymaking process, and help ensure that the public airwaves reflect America’s diverse local communities. This bill should be at the top of the priority list when Congress returns in 2008.”
<p></p>
