<p>WASHINGTON - November 15 - In the first Congressional
hearing held on the controversial case of violent Cuban exile Luis
Posada Carriles, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on
International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight invited
National Security Archive Senior Analyst Peter Kornbluh to testify on
formerly top secret CIA and FBI intelligence reports linking Posada to
the October 6, 1976 bombing of a Cuban civilian airliner. In his
testimony, Kornbluh argued that the declassified records demonstrated
that Posada had concrete foreknowledge of the bombing; was in
possession of a surveillance report on Cuban targets that included the
doomed plane; received coded messages immediately after the plane went
into the ocean from the men who placed the bombs; and was quickly
identified by multiple FBI and CIA sources in Venezuela as one of two
masterminds of the attack that claimed the lives of all 73 passengers
and crew.
<P></P>

Kornbluh called Posada "one of the most prolific purveyors of
political violence in recent history" and said that the evidence in
the plane bombing was "more than sufficient" to have detained Posada
for acts of international terrorism under the Patriot Act. Former
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales refused to designate Posada as a
terrorist and a judge dismissed immigration fraud charges against him
last spring. Posada now lives freely in Miami, as does Orlando Bosch,
who the CIA and FBI both identify as a co-conspirator in the plane
bombing. "The United States now finds itself in the frankly
inexplicable position of having not one but both men who our own
intelligence agencies identified as responsible for bringing down a
civilian airliner living free and unfettered lives in Florida,"
Kornbluh told the Committee.
<P></P>
Kornbluh was joined at the hearing by Dr. Roseanne Persaud Nenninger,
the sister of one of the Guyanese teenagers killed on the plane. In
her testimony, Dr. Nenninger said she wanted to put a "human face" on
the victims of the plane bombing by talking about her brother Raymond
Persaud, a 19-year-old science student on his way to Havana with a
full scholarship to study medicine. She called on the Subcommittee,
chaired by Congressman William Delahunt, to investigate fully how the
Bush administration had allowed Posada to go free, so that her family
and those of all the other Cuban, Guyanese and Korean passengers could
finally see justice done for their loved ones. Ann Louise Bardach, who
interviewed Posada for The New York Times in 1998 on his involvement
in a string of hotel bombings in Cuba, also testified on her extensive
research into Posada's many violent activities.

Kornbluh's testimony and the five documents that he reviewed for the
House Committee were posted today on the Archive's Web site.
