<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 -  U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Susan 
          Collins (R-ME) have introduced the Rural Medicare Equity Act of 2007 
          to address Medicare's discrimination against rural America&#8217;s seniors 
          and health care providers. The legislation will change some of the inequitable 
          payments that harm rural communities and provide rural areas the help 
          they need to grow crucial health information technology infrastructures. 
          It also offers incentives to help attract the nation&#8217;s top medical 
          talent to underserved rural areas and mandates rural representation 
          on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission that is proportional to 
          the nation&#8217;s number of rural Medicare beneficiaries. </p>
          <p>&#8220;It is time to change Medicare to ensure fairness for rural 
            states like Wisconsin,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;Rural Wisconsinites 
            and all Americans living in rural areas have worked hard and paid 
            into the Medicare program all their lives and deserve full access 
            to the benefits that Medicare provides.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Medicare&#8217;s reimbursement systems have historically tended 
            to favor urban areas and failed to take the special needs of rural 
            states like Maine into account. This simply is not fair. The people 
            of Maine pay the same payroll taxes to Medicare, and our seniors pay 
            the same premiums, deductibles and copayments as Medicare beneficiaries 
            in other parts of the country,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;The legislation 
            we are introducing today will help to reduce these inequities and 
            promote fairness in Medicare spending.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Almost one-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries currently resides in 
            rural areas, where both geographic isolation and the scarcity of health 
            care providers are serious barriers to accessing care. In these areas, 
            physicians are paid at lower rates compared to their urban counterparts, 
            hospitals have a more difficult time recruiting staff, and health 
            information technology adoption lags. The Rural Medicare Equity Act 
            of 2007 will address some of the systemic inequities that exist within 
            the Medicare program to improve access and quality for rural Medicare 
            beneficiaries.</p>
          
        <p><strong>The Rural Medicare Equity Act of 2007 would:</strong></p> 
        <li>Create fairer reimbursement for rural physicians through elimination 
          of the geographic practice cost index (GPCI) for work.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Take a first step to reform the unfair Medicare formulas for physicians 
          by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to examine data 
          reform for the practice expense GPCI.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Create a demonstration project to help rural hospitals to host educators 
          and clinical practitioners in clinical rotations.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Create a demonstration project to allow for health information technology 
          improvements in rural areas.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Require that the proportion of MedPAC members representing rural interests 
          be no less than proportion of Medicare beneficiaries residing in rural 
          areas.</li><!-- #EndEditable -->
