<p>WASHINGTON - November 4 - On Monday, over 400 Michigan students will join with thousands of other young people as they converge on our nation’s capital for Power Shift, the first-ever national youth summit to solve the climate crisis. The conference will engage high school and college students from all 50 states about solutions to global warming and how they can put those solutions into practice on their campuses, in their communities, and in the political arena. Michigan students will deliver over 45,000 petitions to Rep. John Dingell, the powerful Michigan Democrat and Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asking him to take immediate action on global warming.
<P></P>At Power Shift, young leaders from all backgrounds will share ideas, learn new skills, make connections and ultimately use their collective experience to create a fresh, inspiring vision of the future; one focused on America’s potential to build a clean energy economy, achieve energy independence, create millions of green jobs, increase global equity, and revitalize the economy.
<P></P>
Some students will meet later today with Rep. Dingell's staff and deliver their petitions.  This past summer, Dingell voted against a national renewable energy standard of 15 percent and stymied any significant increase to auto fuel efficiency standards, a concession to the auto industry from which he enjoys overwhelming support.  Dingell now says he wants a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions, but his public comments suggest he may try to derail meaningful progress in Congress on global warming.
<P></P>
In a July interview on C-SPAN, Dingell announced he would propose the carbon tax but warned that voters might not be willing to pay it to limit greenhouse gas emissions. He said he would introduce the idea “just to sort of see how people really feel about this.” Then last month Dingell added, “a carbon tax is going to carry with it a lot of pain.”
<P></P>
“Young people we have an incredible opportunity to advance an inspiring new vision for America and at Power Shift they will," said Kate Smolski, Greenpeace Legislative Coordinator. "While leaders like John Dingell have been telling us what they can’t do about climate change, a youth movement has grown to show this country exactly how much we can do. From our college campuses to Capitol Hill,  they are demanding that bold and immediate action be taken to avoid a climate crisis.”
<P></P>
Michigan resident and Michigan State junior Skye Black said she wants Dingell to take immediate action for her, her family, and the planet.
<P></P>
"Rep. Dingell is dragging his feet on solutions on global warming," Black said. "We want no more rhetoric, stalling, or false promises. We want action now."
<P></P>
With voter registration among 18-29 year olds at its highest level in thirty years - and rising - young voters have become an increasingly important demographic, and the urgency of adopting bold action to address global warming and recast energy policy has not been lost on them: 47% of those young voters in 2006 indicated that their votes went to candidates based on their concern about the U.S. energy policy. Along these lines, event organizers have invited 2008 presidential candidates and influential environmental advocates to address the conference.
<P></P>
The activities of the young people attending Power Shift 2007 are amplified by the hundreds of activities that took place in communities across the nation this past weekend encouraging Congress to “Step It Up” in addressing the issue of climate change. The Energy Action Coalition and Step It Up are united in support of the 1Sky Climate Initiative calling for a bolder, broader direction in addressing climate change.
<P></P>
Energy Action Coalition is a group of over 40 leading youth environmental and social justice organizations, including Greenpeace, working together to leverage their collective power and strengthen the clean energy movement in North America. In August 2006, Energy Action launched the Campus Climate Challenge, a joint campaign by 37 organizations from the US and Canada focused on uniting students to pass 100% clean energy policies on their campuses. Since its inception, the Climate Challenge has spread to students on more than 500 high school and college campuses.
