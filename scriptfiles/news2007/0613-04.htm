<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 13 - 
Media
Matters for America</i> and <i>Campaign
for America's Future</i> released a special report, "The
Progressive Majority: Why a Conservative America is a Myth,"
documenting
how the conventional wisdom that Americans are overwhelmingly
conservative is
fundamentally false. Through decades of public opinion data from
nonpartisan
sources, the report shows the majority of Americans hold progressive
positions
on a broad range of issues.</p>

<p>"<b>This report shows that on issue after
issue, most
Americans agree with progressives and have for decades, despite what we
hear
from the media</b>." said
David Brock, President and CEO of <i>Media
Matters</i>. <b>"The
conventional
wisdom advanced by the media -- that the United States is becoming
more and
more conservative -- has been debunked repeatedly by independent public
polling, but that hasn't stopped them from perpetuating this clearly
flawed perception."</b></p>

<p><i>Media
Matters</i> and <i>Campaign
for
America's Future</i> conducted this study by examining the past
20
years of independent, nonpartisan polling data from sources such as the
American National Election Studies (NES), the General Social Survey
(GSS), and Gallup
polls. By compiling
all of this data, we have examined not only the top-level conclusions,
but the
underlying questions asked in each survey.</p>

<p><b>KEY
FINDINGS:</b> </p>

<ul><li><b>The role of government</b>
-- 69 percent of
Americans believe the government "should care for those who can't care
for themselves"; twice as many people (43 percent vs. 20 percent) want
"government to provide many more services even if it means an increase
in spending" as want government to provide fewer services "in order to
reduce spending." </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>The economy</b>
-- 77 percent of
Americans think Congress should increase the minimum wage; 66 percent
believe "upper-income people" pay too little in taxes; 53 percent feel
the Bush administration's tax cuts have failed because they have
increased the deficit and caused cuts in government programs. </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Social issues</b>
-- 61 percent of Americans support embryonic stem cell research; 62
percent want to protect <i>Roe v.
Wade</i>; only 3 percent of Americans rank same-sex marriage as
the "most important" social issue. </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Security</b> --
43 percent of Americans say we are spending too much on our military;
60 percent feel the federal government should do more about restricting
the kinds of guns that people can purchase. </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>The environment</b> --
75 percent of Americans would be wiling to pay more for electricity if
it were generated by renewable sources to help reduce global warming;
79 percent want higher emissions standard for automobiles. </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Energy</b>
-- 52 percent of Americans believe "the best way for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on foreign
oil" is to "have the government invest in alternative energy sources"<b>;</b> 68 percent of the public
thinks U.S.
energy policy is better solved by conservation than production. </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Immigration</b>
-- 57 percent of Americans feel "most recent immigrants to the U.S.
contribute to this country" rather than "cause problems." Sixty-seven
percent of Americans feel that "on the whole," immigration is a "good
thing for this country today." </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Health care</b>
-- 69 percent of Americans think it is the responsibility of the
federal government to make sure all Americans have access to health
coverage; 76 percent find access to health care more important than
maintaining the Bush tax cuts; three in five would be willing to have
their own taxes increased to achieve universal coverage. </li></ul>
