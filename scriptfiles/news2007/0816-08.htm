<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 16 - Larry Cox, Amnesty International USA’s executive director, issued the following statement in response to today’s verdict in the trial of Jose Padilla and two co-defendants charged with terrorism-related offenses:

<P></P>“The trial, part of which an Amnesty International observer attended, failed to address a key issue which poses a great threat to all Americans – detention of a U.S. citizen without charge, as well as alleged torture and ill-treatment during detention.  The timing of the U.S. government’s addition of Mr. Padilla to the existing conspiracy charge in the south Florida case raises questions.  Mr. Padilla’s indictment in a U.S. federal court ensured that the circumstances of Mr. Padilla’s incommunicado military detention without charge would not be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
<P></P>“This verdict, if it stands, cannot be seen as an endorsement of a regime of unreviewable executive detention.  President Bush should not take today's ruling as permission to continue to hold Americans outside the law at his whim.”
