<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 6 - The U.S. Army has taken a step backwards from its
previously announced plans to begin contracting out its environmental,
natural and cultural resource staff positions, according to agency
documents released today by Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility (PEER).&nbsp; In the two major bases preparing
privatization plans this year, one has been withdrawn and the other is
awaiting a final decision.<br>
<br>
In a July 10 announcement, the Army notified contractors that no
environmental or resource jobs would be subject to bid at the nation's
oldest Army facility, the military reservation (including the U.S.
Military Academy) at West Point.&nbsp; A similar proposal affecting the
Army's largest base, the White Sands Missile Range, has been posted for
"industry and government comments" until August 9th with a final
decision expected later this month.<br>

<br>
The outcome at these two bases may set the policy at all other
installations.&nbsp; Nationally, several thousand Army civilian
environmental and resource jobs may be affected.&nbsp; At West Point,
approximately 25 jobs were taken off the auction block.&nbsp; At White
Sands, the fate of nearly 30 positions hangs in the balance.<br>
<br>
Under earlier announced plans, all environmental functions at both West
Point and White Sands were classified as "commercial in nature" and the
only positions exempt from potential replacement are the most senior
positions that would be retained to oversee the contracts. <br>
<br>
"On this important policy, the Army should be speaking with one voice,"
stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch.&nbsp; "The stance taken at
West Point is correct and should become the Army-wide position."<br>

<br>
PEER and several of the Army's own lawyers contend that that
privatizing these functions violates the basic conservation law
governing Defense Department operations.&nbsp; Previously, PEER settled
a similar case blocking efforts by the Air Force to contract its
natural resource functions at Edwards Air Force base in
California.&nbsp; The organization is gearing up to mount lawsuits
against any other contracting packages that include environmental and
resource protection jobs.<br>
<br>
This May, PEER asked Congress to intervene to stop the outsourcing
plans and instead require the Pentagon to report on whether it is
meeting current environmental mandates.&nbsp; In addition, new
leadership in both the Congress and the Defense Department are
evidencing more concern with environmental compliance and resource
conservation on domestic bases.&nbsp; The House Energy and Commerce
committee, for example, is embarking on a series of hearings on
pollution and resource destruction at military bases. <br>
<br>
"At this critical juncture, the Army cannot afford to discard its
in-house environmental and resource expertise," Ruch added.&nbsp; "The
reason that Congress mandated these jobs be performed by civil servants
is the policy judgment that this work is inherently governmental and
may be seriously compromised if privatized."<br>
