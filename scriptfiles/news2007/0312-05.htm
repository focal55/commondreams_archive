<p>Extensive use of child labor in a Guatemalan food processing factory has been uncovered less than a ten minute drive from where President Bush will speak today in praise of the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

 

<p>Eleven to fourteen hour work shifts, six and seven day work weeks, sub-minimum wage pay with no premium for overtime were reported by child workers at the Legumex food processing factory in rural Chimaltenango province. These conditions violate Guatemalan labor laws.

 

<p>A report on conditions at the factory, entitled Harvest of Shame, includes interviews with child workers conducted by leading anti-sweatshop advocate, Charles Kernaghan of the New York City-based National Labor Committee.  Some of the children at the plant are thirteen years old and younger.

 

<p>The study was prepared in collaboration with a Guatemalan NGO, the Center for Studies and Support for Local Development (CEADEL).
