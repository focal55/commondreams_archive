<p>WASHINGTON - January 19 - League of Women Voters President 
Mary G. Wilson today commended Senators for their quick action in 
derailing this week&#8217;s efforts to table significant lobbying and 
ethics reform proposals. After days of uncertainty and late-night 
blockage of the legislation, the Senate last night voted 96 to 2 to 
reduce the influence of lobbyists, strengthen ethics guidelines, and 
limit the actions of spouses of Senators.</p>

<p>&#8220;The League commends Senator Reid and others for acting quickly 
in response to Wednesday night&#8217;s stalemate and ensuring an honest 
up or down vote on these historic reforms,&#8221; said Wilson. 
&#8220;Voters have expressed a clear dissatisfaction with the unbridled 
level of corruption in Congress, and last night&#8217;s overwhelming 
passage of ethics and lobbying reform indicates their voices are at last 
being heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are deeply disappointed, however, in those Senators who 
voted to defeat a proposal to create an independent ethics panel that 
would provide a nonpartisan, professional channel through which ethics 
rules could be enforced. Additionally, we regret that the "astroturf" 
provisions were defeated. These provisions would require disclosure of 
expensive campaigns by lobbying firms aimed at creating supposed 
grassroots support.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Our work to restore ethical public leadership is far from 
finished. League members in communities nationwide will continue to work 
diligently to ensure citizens can have faith in their democracy at all 
levels of government,&#8221; Wilson concluded.</p>
