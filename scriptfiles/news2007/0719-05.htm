<p>CALIFORNIA- JULY 19 - Statement of Becky Gillette, toxics analyst for the Sierra Club in response to today's House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the dangers posed by toxic trailers. </p>

<p>"We are very thankful that the House Committee on Oversite and Government Reform is looking into this tragic issue. Gulf Coast residents have been suffering from the health effects caused by these toxic trailers for over two years and with each passing day the long-term risks of cancer from formaldehyde exposure increase. With very little affordable housing rebuilt, many families have no choice but to continue living in these dangerous conditions. </p>

<p>"Despite the fact that these toxic trailers have caused a variety of health problems and in some cases possibly even death in the Gulf Coast, FEMA is still preparing to ship them across the country to places like North Dakota. Disaster victims deserve better from their government. They deserve safe, healthy emergency housing.</p>

<p>"It is far past time for the U.S. to phase out the use of formaldehyde-based glues that caused this health threat. It is shameful that this known harmful gas is still allowed to be used in building materials, especially when safer alternatives exist." </p>

<p>As the first group to discover the toxicity of FEMA trailers, the Sierra Club has taken a lead role in fighting for better disaster assistance and emergency housing. Testing by the Sierra Club in Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama showed that 88 percent of trailers tested in 2006 and 2007 had formaldehyde levels above the EPA's recommended limit. Even the EPA's own testing showed that FEMA trailers had average formaldehyde levels three times higher than the EPA standard. Tests currently being conducted by the Sierra Club and Texas Wildlife and Parks on FEMA trailers in Texas are also showing high formaldehyde levels. </p>
