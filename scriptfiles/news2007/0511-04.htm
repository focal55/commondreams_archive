<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - The American Civil Liberties Union today cheered an amendment 
to the House Intelligence Reauthorization Bill that would prevent illegal 
domestic wiretapping by the government. The amendment, by Representatives Adam 
Schiff (D-CA) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ), will reaffirm the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act (FISA) as the only legal means of collecting electronic 
intelligence surveillance. The amendment was passed late last night by a vote of 
245-178.</p>
<p>"Congress has signaled that it will not allow the president to continue the 
National Security Agency’s illegal eavesdropping," said Caroline Fredrickson, 
Director of the ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office. "Passage of the 
Schiff/Flake amendment is Congress drawing a line in the sand. This amendment 
reaffirms that FISA is the law and it needs to be followed."</p>
<p>Congress originally passed FISA to provide the exclusive authority for the 
wiretapping of people in the United States in foreign intelligence 
investigations to protect national security. As the Senate Report noted, FISA 
"was designed . . . to curb the practice by which the Executive Branch may 
conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on its own unilateral determination 
that national security justifies it."</p>

<p>Passage of this amendment makes clear that the House will not capitulate to 
separate legislative proposals by the Administration that would give the NSA the 
freedom to snoop into innocent Americans lives. While the Administration claims 
that its proposed FISA changes would "modernize" the law, in truth they would 
gut the judicial oversight mechanisms carefully crafted to prevent abuse, while 
expanding the scope of communications that can be intercepted under FISA. The 
ACLU noted that, despite many recent hearings about "modernization" and 
"technology neutrality," the administration has not publicly provided Congress 
with a single example of how current FISA standards have either prevented the 
intelligence community from using new technologies, or proven unworkable for the 
agents tasked with following them. </p>
<p>"We applaud Congressmen Schiff and Flake for their work to uphold the rule of 
law," said Michelle Richardson, ACLU Legislative Consultant. "Today is the first 
move towards Congress growing a backbone. We hope that the Senate will follow 
their lead and not be swayed by the administration and Department of Justice’s 
unconstitutional attempts to eviscerate FISA."<br>
