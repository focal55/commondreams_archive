<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 14 - The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed sorrow today over the death of Aref Ali Filaih, a correspondent for the independent news agency Aswat al-Iraq, who was killed by a roadside bomb on Monday while on his way to an assignment south of Al-Khalis town in Diyala province. Aswat al-Iraq announced his death today. He is the third journalist for the agency to be killed in the past two weeks. 

 

<P></P>“We mourn the loss of Aref Ali Filaih and offer our condolences to his family and colleagues,” said Joel Simon, CPJ’s Executive Director. “Far too many journalists are paying the ultimate price for reporting the Iraq story.”

 

<P></P>At least 106 journalists and 39 media support staffers have been killed in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003, making Iraq the deadliest conflict for the press in CPJ’s 26-year history.

 

<P></P>CPJ is a New York–based, independent, nonprofit organization that works to safeguard press freedom worldwide. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.cpj.org" target="_new">www.cpj.org</a>.
