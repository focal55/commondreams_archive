Bangkok, Thailand — April 30 &mdash; Greenpeace today demanded that the world’s Governments take immediate action to revolutionise global energy production and use, in response to repeated warnings about catastrophic climate change from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

 

<P></P>As the IPCC assembles in Bangkok to agree its report, 'Mitigation of Climate Change'- the third in the series that will make up the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report - the international environmental campaign group warned that decisions taken now about future energy supply will determine the levels of climate chaos the planet is subjected to.

 

<P></P>"We now stand at a 'climate crossroads," said Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International Climate & Energy Campaigner. "We can go down the road of renewable energy and smart efficient use of energy, keep the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change or we can keep blundering on in the same direction into a fossil-fuelled future of extreme weather, drastic water shortages and desperate climate refugees. We cannot afford to take a wrong turn".

 

<P></P>Whilst the IPCC's 'Mitigation of Climate Change' document will assess all the recent literature regarding the options available to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Greenpeace, in partnership with the European Renewable Energy Council, has already produced an energy blueprint (Energy [R]evolution) (1). This energy scenario shows how global CO2 emissions could be halved by 2050 using existing clean technologies and applying them in a more efficient way.

 

<P></P>On the economic advantages of the Energy [R]evolution scenario, Sven Teske Greenpeace International Climate & Energy Campaigner said, “Our global energy concept means, that the investment volume for new power plants until 2030 will be in a range of 300-350 billion dollars per year  – almost equal to the amount of money currently spent on subsidies for fossil fuels. To shift this money and invest in renewable energy and cogeneration could cut CO2 emission of the global power sector by half by 2030, which is a win-win situation for utilities around the world".

 

<P></P>"We have shown that the world can have safe, robust renewable energy, that we can achieve the efficiencies needed and we can do all this while phasing out damaging and dangerous sources such as coal and nuclear and without the use of unproven 'techno-fixes' like carbon capture and storage,” Tara Buakamsri Greenpeace Southeast Asia Climate & Energy Campaigner said.

 

<P></P>SolarGeneration, students campaigning for a greater use of renewable energy around the world, will have their opportunity to speak to Dr. Pachauri, Chair of the IPCC. Dr Pachauri will address the students, from Thailand, India, Indonesia, Philippines, China, Germany and France at their climate kiosk before the IPCC meeting.
