<p>NATIONWIDE - November 8 - The U.S. military announced six troop deaths on Tuesday, making 2007 the deadliest year for American troops since the start of the Iraq War.  Military families across the country are outraged and saddened by the continued loss of lives in Iraq. Even more, they are disappointed in Congress for continuing to fund the war and failing to bring an immediate end to the death and destruction. As Veterans Day approaches, members of Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), a national organization of people opposed to the war in Iraq who have relatives or loved ones who have served in the military during the period of the Iraq war, will honor the over 3,850 American service men and women, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, women, and men who have died as a result of the war.

“The Bush Administration continues to use lies and fear to get Congress to continue to fund the war. But the numbers do not lie; 2007 has been the deadliest year for American troops thus far, and the vast majority of the American people and the troops themselves do not support this war. Congress has failed the troops and all of us by continuing to fund the war. Congress needs to understand that, this year more than ever, funding this war is killing our troops,” said Nancy Lessin, a co-founder of MFSO.
