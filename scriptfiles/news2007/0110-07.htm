<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - I&#8217;m delighted to stand here with these great leaders in Congress on such an important day for America&#8217;s working families. On behalf of those working men and women, I want to commend the new leaders of the House of Representatives for taking up the minimum wage bill with such expediency. <BR>
<BR>
At a time when all working people are struggling to make ends meet, our nation&#8217;s lowest-paid workers are long overdue for a raise. Republican leaders of the last Congress repeatedly blocked increases with poison pill amendments, including tax breaks to business and even rollbacks of worker protections such as overtime pay. 
<P>Today&#8217;s upcoming House vote makes it clear that our new Congress is listening to what working Americans said last November. It heard their call for change and is working to right a big wrong &#8211; and pass a minimum wage increase today. </P><P>Our new Congress is saying to working people: &#8220;This country doesn&#8217;t belong only to the giant corporations and the fat-cat lobbyists. You deserve a decent day&#8217;s pay for a decent day&#8217;s work. No more excuses. No more delays.&#8221; </P><P>Unfortunately, President Bush has called for a minimum wage raise only if coupled with even more tax breaks for business. But business has enjoyed hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts since Bush took office, while health care, secure retirements and the minimum wage have all been on government&#8217;s back burner. In the last 10 years, in fact, the Republican-led Congress provided corporations with $276 billion in tax cuts and provided small businesses with another $36 billion in dedicated tax breaks. </P><P>An increase in pay for America&#8217;s lowest paid workers should not have to depend on even more payoffs to business. And so today we&#8217;re calling on House members and Senators &#8211; Republicans and Democrats alike &#8211; to reject corporate poison pills and vote for a fair, long overdue raise in the minimum wage. America&#8217;s workers deserve a clean vote on a $7.25 minimum wage, with no strings attached. </P><P>Today, House leaders are stepping forward to fulfill their mandate for change. We urge the Senate to follow suit.
