<p>WASHINGTON - October 17 - Hundreds of activists from a variety of anti-war, justice and clean energy groups and networks will participate in a series of non-violent direct actions on Monday October 22nd on Capitol Hill.  Throughout the preceding weekend activists will be gathering for training and preparation. Organizing under the banner “No War, No Warming”, activists are planning for a day of actions to target Congress. Despite being elected nearly one year ago with a clear public mandate to both end the war and take strong action on global warming, the 110th Congress has so far failed on both counts.  
<P></P>
What do war and global warming have in common?  Oil. Burning oil, gas and coal is responsible for the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions. The fossil fuel industry has systematically funded efforts to discredit legitimate climate science and obstruct national and international efforts to stop global warming for more than a decade.   
<P></P>
It is the USA’s addiction to oil that drove our country into war with Iraq. Even Alan Greenspan says it. Our future energy choices must not fuel either war or warming. The first step in ending our collective addiction to fossil fuels is reducing their influence over our politicians and demanding a separation of oil and state.
