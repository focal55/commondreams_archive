<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 13 - <a target="_self" href="http://www.uspirg.org/html/June%2012%20Higher%20Education%20sign%20on%20letter.doc">Read the Letter.<br>
<br>
</a>A national coalition
of organizations including the United States Student Association, U.S. PIRG,
the AFL-CIO and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities
today sent a letter to all members of Congress urging them to address critical
priorities in American higher education.&nbsp; The letter focused on four key points:
<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase
     need-based grant aid by
     raising the maximum Pell Grant award.<br>
<br></li><li>&nbsp; Make
     student loans more affordable
     by lowering interest rates, limiting the percentage of income students
     spend repaying loans and expanding loan forgiveness programs for critical
     public service careers.<br>
<br></li><li>&nbsp; Cut
     waste in the student loan programs by
     reducing taxpayer subsidies and redirecting those funds to increase
     student aid and limit debt burden.<br>
<br></li><li>&nbsp; Make
     student loans more fair
     by passing regulations that limit conflicts of interest, make the
     relationships between colleges and lenders more transparent, and require
     schools and lenders to inform students of their right to shop around for
     the best deal.</li>
</ul>



<p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday, June 13th
the House Education and Labor Committee is scheduled to discuss and vote on
legislation that address student grant and loan programs.</p>
