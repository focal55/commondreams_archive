<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 13 -- Because of a backroom parliamentary agreement brokered by Senate leadership that required 60 votes for the amendment's passage, the Dorgan-Grassley Amendment to the farm bill was withdrawn even after getting 56 bipartisan votes of support.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u>Statement by Rev. David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World</u></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p>The withdrawal of this modest move towards reform is a stunning display of political gamesmanship. It is time for a farm and food policy that ensures nutrition assistance to struggling families in this country, a more level playing field for all farmers and real investments in rural development.</p>
<p>People of faith and public interest groups from across the political spectrum sent a clear message to Congress this year that this is the time for reform of the outdated commodity payment system.</p>
<p>Senators Dorgan and Grassley introduced a common sense measure calling for the capping of commodity payments to any one household at $250,000. Savings would have been redirected to nutrition and conservation initiatives. The majority of Senators supported this amendment But, Senate Leadership allowed political pressure from their own party to cause the status quo to win out once again over the needs of farmers and hungry and poor people.<br>
