        , a free online database at the heart of the Center’s “Well Connected” project on media and telecommunications. This new license, featured on the Center’s Website, gives the public and organizations the freedom to copy, adapt and redistribute Media Tracker data at no charge.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;The Media Tracker database contains more than 5 million records of government sources, corporate disclosure documents and original research that allows anyone to identify media ownership, lobbying activities and communications sources by ZIP code, city or state. The Center expects the license, created in partnership with the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) in New York, to be a model for other social science databases, particularly in the fields of telecommunications, media and technology.
