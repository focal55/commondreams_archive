<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Brussels (Belgium) – From today until April 5, the world's 
leading scientific experts are to gather in Brussels to launch the 
second volume of the United Nation's Fourth Assessment Report, which 
addresses climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. [1]

<P></P>The report is expected to portray a bleak future for the world's poorest 
countries, which have done least to pollute the atmosphere.

<P></P>Despite the negligible historical emissions of greenhouse gases by the 
least developed countries, their people will suffer most from climate 
change, as they are the most vulnerable to the impacts and least able to 
adapt.

<P></P>The second volume of the Fourth Assessment Report of the UN 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Working Group II 
provides the starkest warning yet on the threat of global climate change 
and predicts the severe consequences the planet will face unless world 
leaders take urgent action to cut emissions of greenhouse gases.

<P></P>Friends of the Earth International's Climate Campaigner, Catherine 
Pearce, said: "The scientific findings are stronger than ever. This 
report is likely to confirm that not only are we seeing the impacts of 
climate change around us already, but worse is yet to come and the 
world's poorest people are being hardest hit.

<P></P>"The industrialised world, including the USA, must lead the way by 
making significant cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions and helping 
less developed countries to develop sustainable, low-carbon economies.

<P></P>"Current efforts on adaptation, including available funds, are clearly 
inadequate to meet the scale of what is required. Urgent assistance is 
needed for those developing countries, which have done nothing to 
contribute to the current threat of climate change and are already 
facing the devastating effects."

<P></P>"In Bali this December, industrialised countries must also agree a more 
effective and stronger second round to the Kyoto agreement on climate 
change which starts in 2013.”

<P></P>The UN report - the second of a series based on the latest scientific 
literature - analyses how climate change is affecting natural and human 
systems, what the impacts will be and how far adaptation and mitigation 
can reduce the impacts.

<P></P>The report, which has taken six years to compile, draws on research by 
2,500 scientists from over 130 countries and should shock the world into 
taking urgent action to reduce global emissions.

<P></P>Government delegates from more than 100 countries are expected to agree 
that hundreds of millions of people are vulnerable to flooding due to 
sea level rise, especially in densely populated and low-lying 
settlements which already face other challenges, such as tropical storms.

<P></P>The UN report is also expected to warn that projected climate change is 
likely to affect millions of people through increases in malnutrition, 
deaths, disease and injury due to heat waves, floods, storms, fires and 
droughts.

<P></P>Worryingly, scientists are also expected to state that over the next 
half-century it is very likely that climate change will impede the 
achievement of the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. [2]

<P></P>TESTIMONIES:

<P></P>FROM NIGERIA:

<P></P>"Climate Change in Nigeria is a ticking time bomb as there is little or 
no action aimed at mitigating its impacts," according to Nnimmo Bassey 
of ERA/Friends of the Earth Nigeria. For more information: Tel: +234 
8037274395 (Nigeria)


<P></P>FROM GHANA:

<P></P>"A devastating sea erosion is taking place along the Ada coast in Ghana 
and is under-reported by the media. Over 5,000 metres of land had been 
submerged and there is a serious risk that the whole Ada land would be 
submerged in the short term. Coastal dwellers claim that the very 
existence of about 50 communities is under threat. It is absolutely 
essential to have a legally binding and effective global adaptation fund 
to address the urgent adaptation needs in less developed countries and 
small island states," according to Erasmus Aborley in Ghana. For more 
information: Tel: +233-21-286123 and +233-21-512312 (Ghana)


<P></P>FROM HAITI:

<P></P>"One of the major impacts of climate change on small island states is 
the loss of biodiversity and its benefits. These nations have very 
limited resources, and climate-change related catastrophes negatively 
affect their capacity to limit damages, prevent epidemics and rebuilt 
infrastructure, economies and communities in the long term," according 
to Aldrin Calixte of Friends of the Earth Haiti. For more information: 
Tel: +509-4019684 or +509-7337377 (Haiti)


<P></P>FROM PERU:

<P></P>"Glaciers in Peru are melting fast, bringing floods and destruction 
locally but also negatively affecting energy generation and water 
resources nationally. In Peru, 60% of the population and 70% of the 
productive activities are located on the coast, a desert strip whose 
water provision depends almost entirely on the mountain area. In 
addition, 70% of the electricity supply comes from that area. It is 
estimated that in next the 10 years all the glaciers below 5500m will 
disappear, meaning not only the disappearance of the water supply for 
human consumption, but also strong negative impacts on the national 
energy situation, nd the economy, " according to María Teresa Colque 
Pinelo of Friends of the Earth Perú. For more information: +511-978 99 
65 (cell in Peru).


<P></P>FROM MAURITIUS:

<P></P>"Small island developing states (SIDS) are ecologically the most fragile 
and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. 
These countries are particularly fragile to climate variability and 
climate change is having profound effects on the economic and social 
conditions of coastal populations. Cyclones and climate change are 
taking a direct toll on the economy of these countries and negatively 
impact particularly subsistence farmers and artisanal fishermen (hence 
increasing poverty), creating food and water shortages and health 
problems. Due to their small size, islands like Mauritius are 
particularly exposed to climate change and have no defense against this 
phenomenon," according to Rajen Awotar, Executive Chairman of Friends of 
the Earth Mauritius / MAUDESCO. For more information: Tel: + 230 
425-2417 (Mauritius)


<P></P>FROM AUSTRALIA:

<P></P>"Australia is the hottest and most water scarce continent in the world. 
Drought and bushfires have been part of our history. Climate change is 
making Australia hotter and drier. It is clear to anyone who is paying 
attention to the issue of global warming that there is a historical 
liability by the developed nations. Having created a disproportionate 
amount of greenhouse gases for many decades, which has allowed us to 
develop our economy, it would be extremely mean spirited for Australia 
not to commit to deep cuts in emissions as a way of acknowledging our 
historic and contemporary carbon debt. The developed world has benefited 
from our use of fossil fuels; the onus is now on us to make deep cuts 
while also helping other nations to do the same," according to Stephanie 
Long of Friends of the Earth Australia. For more information: +61-414 
136 461 (cell. in Australia).


<P></P>FROM CANADA:

<P></P>"Canadians are clearly living with impacts of climate chaos and can 
expect more - milder winters are responsible for the ravages of western 
forests from the pine beetle and melting permafrost. Severe and extreme 
weather is already linked with premature death, illness and violence in 
our big cities. Vulnerable Canadians including senior citizens and those 
living with fixed income, low incomes or job loss are least able to cope 
with the increasing impacts we can expect from the warming climate. The 
upcoming IPCC report should be a clarion call to action by public health 
officials," said Beatrice Olivastri, Chief Executive Officer, Friends of 
the Earth Canada. For more information: + 1-613 724 8690 (cell. in Canada).
