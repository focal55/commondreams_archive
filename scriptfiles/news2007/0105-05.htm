<p>WASHINGTON - January 5 - Cutting student loan interest rates in half will save the
average working- and middle class borrower $4,420 over the life of their loans,
according to <a href="http://www.uspirg.org/home/reports/report-archives/affordable-higher-education/affordable-higher-education-reports/cutting-interest-rates-lowering-student-debt">a new report by U.S. PIRG&rsquo;s Higher Education Project.</a>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Congressional proposal would lower interest rates on
undergraduate subsidized Stafford loans over the next five years until they are
cut in half to 3.4% starting in 2011.&nbsp; In
2004-2005 more than five and a half million students took out subsidized
Stafford loans to pay for college.&nbsp; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Over the past decade we have asked America&rsquo;s college
students to shoulder a heavy burden of debt to pay for college,&rdquo; said Luke
Swarthout, U.S. PIRG Higher Education Advocate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cutting interest rates on student loans will help millions of working
and middle-class students and their families by saving them thousands of
dollars in student loan payments.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By lowering interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans,
Congress can save college graduates thousands of dollars over the life of their
loans. </p><ul><li>&bull; The
     average four-year college student starting school in 2007 with subsidized
     Stafford loans would save $2,280 over the life of his or her loans under
     the proposed legislation.&nbsp; 
</li></ul>
<ul><li>&bull; When
     the interest rate cut is fully phased in, the average four-year college
     student starting school in 2011 with subsidized Stafford loans will save
     $4,420 over the life of his or her loans.&nbsp;
</li></ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">About five and a half million students borrow subsidized
Stafford loans every year.&nbsp; Of those
borrowers, nearly three and a half million attend four-year public or private
non-profit institution.&nbsp; According to the
Congressional Research Service, 65% of traditional-age subsidized Stafford borrowers
come from families with incomes between $26,000 and $91,000.&nbsp; The median income for an American family of
four is $65,000. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Lowering interest rates on loans is a great first step
towards a more affordable college education.&nbsp;
Congress should continue to help students pay for college by increasing
need-based federal student aid and passing broad protections for student borrowers,
such as limits on the percent of income that can be required for student loan
repayment,&rdquo; concluded Swarthout.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The policy proposal analyzed by PIRG would cut the fixed
interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans for undergraduates from 6.8% to 3.4%
over the next five years.&nbsp; Loans
originated during the intervening five years will be set at fixed interest rates
of 6.12% in 2007-08, 5.44% in 2008-09, 4.76% in 2009-10, 4.08% in 2010-11, and
3.4% from 2011 forward.&nbsp; After
graduation, students would be able to consolidate their loans into one loan at
the weighted average of the interest rates of their various loans.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All federal Stafford loans receive two forms of government
support: the federal government covers the cost of the loans to lenders in case
of student default and provides financial subsidies to insure lenders make a
profit.&nbsp; Stafford loans are considered
&ldquo;subsidized&rdquo; when the government pays the interest charges on the loan while
the student is in school.&nbsp; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the
plan to cut interest rates during the first 100 legislative hours of the 110th
Congress.&nbsp; </p><!-- #EndEditable -->
