<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 9 - Tens of  thousands of U.S. consumers are being organized by the non-profit Co-op America  to pressure major national and independent grocery store operators to follow  the lead of European Union (EU) grocers by making “Fair Trade bananas” more  widely available.&nbsp; Information about the  Co-op America campaign is available at <a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/takeaction/fairtradebananas/" target="_blank">http://www.coopamerica.org/takeaction/fairtradebananas/</a>.</p>
				<p>The new  push for Fair Trade Certified™<strong> </strong>bananas  is being launched amidst growing concerns about the human rights and  environmental records of large conventional banana companies. For example,  Chiquita Brands Inc. recently paid a $25 million fine to the US government after pleading guilty to  transacting with terrorist organizations in Colombia.&nbsp; </p>

				<p>Co-op  America Fair Trade Program Coordinator Yochanan Zakai said:&nbsp; <strong>“The  chances are you have heard about Fair Trade coffee and Fair Trade tea, but you  probably don’t know about Fair Trade bananas and other tropical fruit.&nbsp; Even though Fair Trade tropical fruits have  been available in the US  since 2004, they are relatively rare in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Europe,  where Fair Trade fruit has been available since the mid-1990s, sales of such bananas  have been growing at a rate of about 50 percent a year. It's time for U.S. grocers to  start making available Fair Trade bananas and other fruit.”</strong></p>
				<p>Participants  in the Co-op America campaign are asked to sign a Web-based letter to major  supermarket chains asking for more Fair Trade fruit.&nbsp; The campaign also seeks to enlist interested  consumers in working with a supermarket in their community by sending emails,  making phone calls and enlisting other local shoppers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Past Co-op America  consumer action campaign have resulted in the mobilization of 10,000 or more  consumers to press U.S.  companies for more responsible/greener actions.</p>
				<p>As the  Co-op America Web site explains:&nbsp; <strong>“Fair Trade means a fair deal for farmers,  and a healthier environment for all of us … Through Fair Trade certification,  banana farmers earn a living wage that enables them to not only cover  production costs but also send their children to school and provide medical  care to themselves and their families. Fair Trade premiums are also often  invested in programs that teach farmers about recycling, organics,  reforestation, and other strategies for building healthy communities.”</strong></p>

				<p>The Fair  Trade certification standards forbid the use of the most dangerous toxic  chemicals and pesticides, protecting workers in the field, and guaranteeing the  safety of the bananas in your store. Fair Trade bananas are better for our  environment, as they are not genetically modified, and are grown using  sustainable farming practices such as, mulching, non-chemical weed control, filtering  waste-water, recycling, and safe waste management.</p>
				<p>Zakai  said:&nbsp; “The actions of Chiquita are a  stark contrast to the family farmers and co-ops who produce Fair Trade  Certified bananas on their own land.”</p>
				<p>Several  independent banana importers – Oke Bananas, Turbana, Albert’s Organics and  Jonathan’s – offer Fair Trade Certified bananas that are available to distributors  serving U.S.  grocers.&nbsp; For more information on Fair  Trade bananas, visit <a href="http://www.transfairusa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.transfairusa.org</a>.</p>
