<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 25 - As Congress prepares to pass another $100 billion for the war, a swarm of peace lobbyists descended on Capitol Hill demanding that US tax dollars stop being spent on war and occupation. 

<P></P>Grassroots America led the activist group with a tour aboard the Yellow Rose of Texas Peace Bus as part of the SWARM on Congress. The peace lobbyists first joined representative Dennis Kucinich‘s press conference (D-OH) in front of the Cannon House office building.

<P></P>“We are here to demand that Congress do what the American people demanded this past November,” said Marine Mom Tina Richards, founder of Grassroots America, “David Obey called me an idiot liberal and to trust the Democrats to use the supplemental to end the war. This has not happened. The message was loud and clear: Get out of Iraq and support our troops by bringing them home now.”

<P></P>Eve Tetaz, a retired DC school teacher, was arrested following the press conference. The arrest happened while Tetaz entered the Hart Senate office building with the group. A long time peace activist, Tetaz was in violation of a stay-away order from a previous arrest during an act of non-violent civil resistance to the Iraq war.
<P></P>Reverand Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus responded to the swarm, “On May 24, 2007, the gauntlet has been thrown down for the peace movement to act. Eve Tetaz, in the spirit of Rosa Parks, has voiced for the Peace movement that we are sick and tired of being sick and tired, the dying must stop now. The pushing forth of the legislation showed the peace movement stands alone for humanity with no alias in congress. It is time to Swarm Congress. “
<P></P>The SWARM on Congress will continue through July 31st with the goal of getting the Congress to use its constitutional power to fulfill the mandate of the 2006 election and end the occupation of Iraq .
