<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 17 - The International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) today will lead as
many as 10,000 transportation workers in a rally on the National Mall in
Washington, D.C. to declare "Enough is Enough" over Bush administration
policies that have plagued air and rail workers since 2001.
    <P></P>"This nation's air and rail workers suffered one grievous assault after
another under the present administration," said IAM International President
Tom Buffenbarger. "Hundreds of thousands of workers lost jobs, pensions and
health care while CEOs and senior executives gorged themselves with
outrageous compensation packages. It's time for a president who isn't deaf
and blind to this kind of rampant injustice."
     <P></P>Presidential candidates Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Senator Joseph
Biden (D-DE) and Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) will address the workers who
came from as far as Guam, Alaska and Hawaii to attend the rally. Former
North Carolina Senator John Edwards and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson
will also appear via video.
     <P></P>"The sacrifices, contributions and needs of transportation workers are
lost on the Bush Administration," said IAM Transportation General Vice
President Robert Roach, Jr. "Airlines dumped more than $12 billion in
pensions on the federal government. While the IAM negotiated replacement
pension plans for its members, there are still more than a hundred thousand
airline workers without real retirement security. Today we begin our search
for a president who will work with transportation labor to provide the
secure jobs, pensions and benefits workers deserve."
     <P></P>The Machinists Union represents more than 200,000 North American
transportation workers, including Flight Attendants, Aircraft Mechanics,
Railroad Machinists, Ramp Service Workers, Customer Service Agents,
Reservation Agents, Food Service Employees, Instructors, and Flight
Simulator Technicians. For more information about the Transportation Day of
Action and the effect Bush administration policies have had on
transportation workers, visit <a href="http://www.17may07.org" target="_new">http://www.17may07.org</a>.<!-- #EndEditable -->
