<p>WASHINGTON - September 17 - This September 17th marks the 220th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution.  The League of Women Voters is working nationwide to highlight the crucial elements of our democracy, and will hold events with students and other groups across the country. 
<P></P>
“Constitution Day marks an important opportunity for us to reflect upon the democratic foundations we still rely on today,” said national League president Mary G. Wilson.
<P></P>
  “It is essential for Americans to remember key ideals such as responsive government, individual liberties and the separation of powers, especially an independent judicial branch. It is our responsibility to teach those lessons to future generations, and also to ensure our leaders are actively protecting the basic civil liberties we fought to obtain.
<P></P>
“For more than 87 years, League members all over the country have worked hands-on to preserve and strengthen our system. Constitution Day serves as an important reminder of that work, and inspires us to keep working to build a better democracy,” Wilson concluded.
<P></P>
This year’s Constitution Day events are part of a joint effort by the League of Women Voters' national Safeguarding U.S. Democracy: Promoting an Independent Judiciary program, the Constitution Project and Justice at Stake.  As part of this project, events in nearly 20 states will promote citizen understanding of the importance of separation of powers and checks and balances as provided for by the U.S. Constitution.
<P></P>
