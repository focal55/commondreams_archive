<p>WASHINGTON  - January 29 - <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pennsylvania 
        leads the nation in the rate of black homicide victimization according 
        to a new analysis of unpublished Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
        Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR) data released today by the Violence 
        Policy Center (VPC). The study, <a href="../studies/blackhomicide.pdf"><i>Black 
        Homicide Victimization in the United States: An Analysis of 2004 Homicide 
        Data</i></a>, uses 2004 data—the most recent data available from the FBI—and 
        is the first analysis to rank the 50 states according to their black homicide 
        rates. The study found overwhelmingly that firearms, usually handguns, 
        were the weapon of choice in the homicides. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The top 10 states 
        with each state's corresponding black homicide victimization rates are: 
        1) Pennsylvania, 29.52 per 100,000; 2) Louisiana, 29.48 per 100,000; 3) 
        Indiana, 29.30 per 100,000; 4) California, 28.95 per 100,000; 5) Missouri, 
        28.63 per 100,000; 6) Michigan, 28.27 per 100,000; 7) Maryland, 24.64 
        per 100,000; 8) Minnesota, 24.45 per 100,000; 9) Nevada, 23.67 per 100,000; 
        and, 10) Arizona, 21.54 per 100,000. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study warns that 
        "the toll that homicide exacts on black teens and young adults in America, 
        both male and female, is disproportionate, disturbing, and undeniable" 
        and concludes, "As efforts are made to reduce America's black homicide 
        victimization toll, the unique facilitating role of firearms cannot be 
        ignored." </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For PENNSYLVANIA, 
        the study found that in 2004: </font>
<ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There were 398
