<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - The following was issued
today by the Office of Sen. Patrick Leahy:
<P></P>
    "This fits a well-worn pattern. In this Administration, accountability
goes by the boards. That seems to be a central tenet in the Bush
Administration -- that no one from their team should be held accountable,
if accountability can be avoided. That goes equally for misconduct and for
incompetence. If you get caught, they will get you immunity. If you get
convicted, they will commute your sentence. They are the Amnesty
Administration. Dodging accountability corrodes our values and our
integrity, which have been real sources of America's enduring strength."
<P></P>
    Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which
has jurisdiction over the FBI, and the Appropriations Subcommittee on State
and Foreign Operations, which has budget jurisdiction over the State
Department.<!-- #EndEditable -->
