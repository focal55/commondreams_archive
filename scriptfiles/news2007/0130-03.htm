<p>NEW YORK  - January 30 - For a 
record-breaking 10 years, the federal minimum wage has not been raised largely 
due to the lobbying efforts of elements of the business community and their 
allies in Congress.&nbsp; However, a fast-growing campaign led by small and 
large business men and women are saying a higher minimum wage is in fact good 
for business. While the Congress debates the issue, states that have led the way 
by raising their minimum wages above the current $5.15 minimum wage have had 
better employment and small business trends than states that have 
not.<BR>
<BR>"<I>Congress should know the facts are very clear versus the 
misinformation that's been spread over the years</I>," said <B>Adnan 
Durrani,</B> President of <B>Condor Ventures</B>, an investment banking firm 
that specializes in technology and consumer product companies. "<I>It is a sound 
business decision to increase the minimum wage.</I>" Higher wages benefit 
business by increasing consumer purchasing power, reducing costly employee 
turnover, raising productivity, and improving product quality, customer 
satisfaction and company reputation.<BR><BR><B>Jim Sinegal</B>, CEO of 
<B>Costco</B>, the nation's largest wholesale club operator with 49 million 
cardholders, has signed the statement in support of raising the minimum wage. 
Sinegal said, "<I>The increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. I hope 
Congress and the President will move swiftly to enact sensible legislation that 
will demonstrate our nation's commitment to reward hard 
work.</I>"<BR><BR><B>Margot Dorfman</B>, CEO of the <B>U.S. Women's Chamber of 
Commerce</B>, said, "<I>We all lose when American workers are underpaid. Whether 
as business owners or employees, women have a significant stake in providing for 
their families and their communities. More than a quarter of all working women 
hold service, production, transportation and material moving occupations, which 
are often subject to low pay, minimum wage earnings. The majority of women are 
living without a spouse. By not paying workers a living wage, we assure that a 
mother working hard to support her family will not be able to make ends 
meet.</I>"<BR><BR>"<I>Investing in employees is the single most important 
investment that a company can make</I>," said <B>Brian Smith</B>, managing 
partner of <B>Blackfoot River Brewing Company</B> in Helena, MT, a state where a 
ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage passed by 73%.<BR><BR>Voicing the 
sentiments of restaurant owners across the country -- from the Four Seasons 
Restaurant in New York to Taco del Sol in Montana -- <B>Kirsten Poole</B>, 
co-owner of <B>Kirsten's Cafe and Dish Caterers</B> in Silver Spring, MD, said, 
"<I>Trying to save money by shortchanging my employees would be like skimping on 
ingredients. I'd lose more than I saved because of declining quality, service, 
reputation and customer base. You can't build a healthy business or a healthy 
economy on a miserly minimum wage.</I>"<BR><BR>The statement supporting higher 
minimum wage and a list of sample signatories appear below. Sign-On is

OWNERS AND EXECUTIVES FOR A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE</B><BR><BR>We, the undersigned 
business owners and executives, support an increase in the minimum wage to 
benefit workers, business and our economy. We know that a minimum wage of $5.15 
an hour is simply not enough for workers to afford necessities for themselves 
and their families. We know that a fair wage floor is essential to healthy 
businesses and communities, and enduring economic growth.<BR><BR>We expect an 
increased minimum wage to provide a boost to local economies. Businesses and 
communities will benefit as low-wage workers spend their much-needed pay raises 
at businesses in the neighborhoods where they live and work.<BR><BR>Higher wages 
benefit business by increasing consumer purchasing power, reducing costly 
employee turnover, raising productivity, and improving product quality, customer 
satisfaction and company reputation. In a recent National Consumers League 
survey, for example, 76 percent of American consumers said "how well a company 
treats/pays employees influences what they buy."<BR><BR>States that have raised 
their minimum wages above the inadequate $5.15 federal level have had better 
employment and small business trends than the other states. Studies by the 
Fiscal Policy Institute and others show that in states with minimum wages above 
$5.15, the number of small businesses and the number of small business employees 
grew more than the other states -- contrary to what critics predicted. Likewise, 
after the last federal minimum wage increases in 1996 and 1997, the nation 
experienced lower unemployment, low inflation, robust growth and declining 
poverty rates.<BR><BR>At $5.15 an hour, today's minimum wage workers have less 
buying power than minimum wage workers had half a century ago. We cannot build a 
strong 21st century economy on a 1950's wage floor. We cannot build a strong 
21st century economy when more and more hardworking Americans struggle to make 
ends meet.<BR><BR>A fair minimum wage shows we value both work and responsible 
businesses. A fair minimum wage is a sound investment in the future of our 
communities and our nation.<!-- #EndEditable -->
