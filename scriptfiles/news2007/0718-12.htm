<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; JULY 18 &mdash; Amnesty International is deeply concerned that El Salvador is improperly using anti-terrorist legislation to punish 13 demonstrators for protesting changes in government social services. The human rights organization fears that the social organization leaders were arrested under terrorism laws to prevent future protest.

<P></P>On July 2, during protests in Suchitoto at the imminent announcement by President Elías Antonio Saca of a national policy on the decentralization of a number of services, including water, the police used rubber bullets and teargas to put down demonstrators.

<P></P>About 30 demonstrators were reportedly arrested in what was a lawful demonstration, according to international human rights standards.

<P></P>Several demonstrators reported that they were subjected to physical and psychological ill-treatment by police. Thirteen of the detainees reportedly are held with convicted prisoners, many guilty of violent offenses.

<P></P>"Amnesty International recognizes that the authorities have the right and responsibility to maintain public order but they must also respect international human rights standards," said Renata Rendón, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas. "The reaction of authorities indicates improper use of the Special Law against Acts of Terrorism."

<P></P>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, among other regional and international bodies, has called on states to "take into account relevant commitments under all international human rights instruments to which they are bound" when dealing with situations in which the fight against terrorism has been invoked.

<P></P>Amnesty International urgently calls on authorities to abide by international human rights standards and undertake immediate, impartial, objective and thorough investigations. The organization believes that any charges that impair the lawful exercise of fundamental rights should be dropped and anyone facing such charges should be released.
