<p>WASHINGTON - August 30 - With Congress in recess, antiwar forces sparked by Progressive Democrats of America have launched the "Pledge for Peace" Campaign in preparation for September's debate on Iraq Defense Appropriations.

</p>

<p>
Said PDA National Director Tim Carpenter, "This historic Congressional open letter represents a platform from which we can move toward ending the Iraq occupation.  It's a line in the sand -- notification from members of Congress that they are ready to use the power of the purse granted them by the Constitution."
