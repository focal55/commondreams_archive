<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 -The Green Party of the United States has joined numerous other groups in endorsing a major demonstration and related events on January 4 organized by The World Can't Wait calling for impeachment of President George W. Bush.
<p class="navigate">For information about the events in Washington, D.C. on Thursday and a list of cosponsors and speakers, visit &lt;<a href="http://www.worldcantwait.org">http://www.worldcantwait.org</a>&gt;.
</p>
          <p class="navigate">"3,000 U.S. servicemembers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed in a war that was launched based on a litany of lies.  The White House's violations of the U.S. Constitution, international laws, and treaties, and contempt for basic human rights, freedoms, and democracy are well documented, and are reported daily in the media.  It's time for Congress to restore the rule of law by impeaching Bush and Cheney," said Sarah "echo" Steiner, co-chair of the Green Party.
          </p>
          <p class="navigate">The Green Party initially passed a resolution for impeachment in July, 2003 &lt;<a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_21_03.html">http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_21_03.html</a>&gt;,
          citing President Bush's and Vice President Dick Cheney's "pattern of making false statements to Congress, the American people, and the world to win support for actions by the American government and military forces" in violation of the U.S. Constitution, Charter of the United Nations, and other international laws; "[s]quandering the resources of the American people to serve the interests of transnational corporations"; and war crimes, including the use of depleted uranium and cluster bombs in the preemptive invasion of Iraq.
          </p>
          <p class="navigate">Greens repeated the call for impeachment as evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors have mounted, most recently in December, 2006, after Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) introduced a motion for impeachment in Congress &lt;<a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2006_12_11.shtml">http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2006_12_11.shtml</a>&gt;.
