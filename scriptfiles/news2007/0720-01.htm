<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 20 - <i>Following his questioning of U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold issued this statement cautioning his colleagues against too easily assuming Iraq's al Anbar province is sufficiently safe for both the short and long term.
</i>
<P></P>“We have been subjected to so much hype in the course of this war that I would urge the Administration and my colleagues to not be so sure that everything is or will continue to be rosy in al Anbar province.  When I was in al Anbar near Fallujah in 2005 there were promising signs, but when I returned to the same area a year later the situation had significantly worsened.  Whether it is Fallujah, Ramadi, Basra, or other places in Iraq, our experiences show us we must not take anything for granted.  It would be foolish of us to assume that the problems in al Anbar province have been resolved or that relative improvements there apply to the rest of the country.  We know this Administration has made too many errors and painted too many rosy scenarios over the last four years for us to proceed with anything but great caution.”
