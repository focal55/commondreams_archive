<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON, DC -- Publics around the world
say the United Nations has the responsibility to protect people from
genocide and other severe human rights abuses even if this means acting
against the will of their own government, according to a study by The
Chicago Council on Global Affairs and WorldPublicOpinion.org, in
cooperation with polling organizations around the world.
    <P></P>Large numbers are open to UN intervention in Darfur, where Arab
militias linked to the Sudanese government are accused of massacring the
civilian population. But many seem to be uninformed about the situation in
western Sudan and declined to answer.
    <P></P>"There seems to be a world-wide consensus that the UN Security Council
has a responsibility to act to protect populations against genocide," said
Steven Kull, editor of WorldPublicOpinion.org.
    <P></P>Respondents in 12 countries were asked whether the UN Security Council
had the "responsibility" to authorize military intervention to protect
people from severe human rights violations "even against the will" of the
government committing such abuses. The most common response in all
countries is that the UN Security Council has a responsibility to authorize
the use of force in such cases.
    <P></P>The Chinese public shows the highest level of support for such
intervention (76%), followed by Americans (74%), Palestinians (69%) and
Israelis (64%).
    <P></P>In the 10 countries asked specifically about international intervention
in Darfur, most of those who answer indicate that they would favor such
action. But large numbers did not respond, suggesting they are uninformed
about the conflict in Sudan.
    <P></P>Support for UN action is highest in France where 84 percent say the
Security Council has either the "responsibility" to authorize intervention
in Darfur (55%) or the "right" (29%) to do so. Close behind is the United
States where 83 percent say the Security Council has either the
"responsibility" (48%) or the "right" (35%) to intervene.
    <P></P>Respondents in seven countries were also asked whether they thought
their country should contribute troops to an international peacekeeping
force in Darfur. Majorities in France (84%) and the United States (65%)
support contributing troops to a peacekeeping force in Darfur.
