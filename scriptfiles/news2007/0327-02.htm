<p>Reston, VA - The American Medical
Student Association (AMSA) calls for widespread support of Thai patients,
physicians and activists in response to Abbott Laboratories&#8217; recent refusal to
provide life-saving medications in Thailand. Abbott&#8217;s unprecedented decision
abandons patients with life-threatening illnesses and violates the right to
health. AMSA believes that Abbott should provide universal access to its
essential medicines rather than prevent vital treatment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Yesterday, March 26, 2007, AMSA stood in solidarity with Thai
colleagues in their national day of action protesting Abbott's alarming
decision. AMSA encourages future and current US healthcare professionals to
boycott visits and telephone calls from representatives of Abbott until the
company supplies all withdrawn medicines to Thai markets. AMSA&nbsp;calls
on&nbsp;its physician colleagues to shut the door on Abbott as&nbsp;Abbott
has&nbsp;shut the door on patients in Thailand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>&quot;Abbott&#8217;s actions threaten patient lives and to our
knowledge, no pharmaceutical company has withdrawn AIDS medicines in
retaliation to a movement toward universal access to healthcare,&#8221; said Laura
Frye, AMSA Global AIDS Fellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;AMSA strongly supports the
legal rights of the Thai government to protect their citizens and their access
to affordable medicines, and we condemn Abbott for refusing to provide
life-saving medications.&#8221; &nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Medical students across the nation are uniting in support of the
Thai government. Representing over 68,000 physicians-in-training, AMSA sends
the message to Abbott that patients&#8217; welfare is the priority of healthcare
professionals. &#8220;We must send a clear message to Abbott and other pharmaceutical
companies that access to affordable medications is a human right and that
patients deserve the opportunity to receive the same treatment available in
developed countries,&#8221; said Frye. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Last year, in an effort to offset the prohibitive costs of AIDS
medicines, Thailand issued a compulsory license in an attempt to manufacture an
inexpensive generic version of Abbott&#8217;s Kaletra. In response, Abbott prevented
access in Thailand to the heat-stable version of&nbsp;Kaletra that is available
to US patients as well as to other life-saving medication, including
antibiotics. AMSA&nbsp;strongly affirms&nbsp;the Thai government's
right&nbsp;to issue compulsory licenses&nbsp;within international trade
agreements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is putting the profits before the people,&#8221; said AMSA National President Jay
Bhatt. &#8220;It&#8217;s time the bottom line doesn't come before the health of our
patients and their access to essential medicines.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
