<p>WASHINGTON - May 14 - Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder issued the following statement today in response to President George W. Bush’s attempt to claim that his “20 in 10” program addresses the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on global warming:

 

<P></P>“The Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must take action regarding greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, but President Bush’s 20 in 10 program barely addresses this problem. The president’s proposal focuses primarily on replacing oil with renewable energy sources such as corn ethanol, and the facts are clear – substituting most formulations of corn ethanol for oil does almost nothing to reduce greenhouse emissions.  Additionally, by directing his administration to do nothing but study this issue until the end of 2008, when a new president is coming into office, President Bush passed the buck on global warming at a time when we cannot afford delay.”

 

<P></P>Friends of the Earth was one of the original plaintiffs in Massachusetts v. EPA, which the Supreme Court responded to on April 2 by requiring the federal government to take action on global warming emissions from motor vehicles.
