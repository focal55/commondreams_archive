<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 17 - Tens of thousands of public
comments supporting Net Neutrality flooded the Federal
Communications Commission before the close of the agency's
official inquiry yesterday. In a landslide, well over 95 percent
of the comments called for rules that prohibit phone and cable
companies from discriminating against Web sites or services. 

</p><p>People from different backgrounds, living in
every corner of the country, demand this basic Internet freedom.
Internet users from all 435 congressional districts used
SavetheInternet.com's online tools to send personal messages to
the FCC.

Network Neutrality -- my games have been used in thousands of

mother and owner of a successful online educational games
business. "Without Net Neutrality, my little Web site would have
been consigned to oblivion because I wouldn't have been able to

</p><p>Net Neutrality supporters include a broad range
of small business owners, students, churchgoers, bloggers,
political candidates, educators and activists who say that
protecting Net Neutrality is fundamental to their family life,
work and interests.

national newspapers every day to get the news our local paper

</p><p><b>Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.)</b> and
<b>Olympia Snowe (R-Maine)</b> -- co-sponsors of the bipartisan
"Internet Freedom Preservation Act" -- sent a letter to FCC
Chairman Kevin Martin urging the FCC to reinstate Net Neutrality
rules.

</p><p>"We see that thousands of people have submitted
comments describing how a free and open Internet benefits
consumers and telling you the discriminatory practices planned
by their Internet service providers would substantially harm
their online experience," Dorgan and Snowe wrote the chairman.
"We hope you take note of these thousands of public comments
urging you to protect Internet freedom."

guaranteed Net Neutrality since the Internet's inception. The

</p><p>The Commission opened its Net Neutrality inquiry
in March, asking for comment on why a neutral Internet is
important; how phone and cable company efforts to discriminate
against content online affect everyday lives; and whether the
agency should enforce rules that would prohibit such
discrimination.
