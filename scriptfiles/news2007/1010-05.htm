<p>   WASHINGTON - October 10 –  Today, as two key House committees are scheduled to 
review FISA-related legislation, the American Civil Liberties Union urged 
lawmakers to keep the Fourth Amendment in FISA and require that the government 
get individual warrants before monitoring American phone calls and emails. Both 
the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are scheduled to mark up 
legislation aimed at fixing the controversial Protect America Act, which broadly 
expanded the government’s ability to spy on Americans. The bill being marked up 
is the RESTORE Act, which grants the government the use of "basket" warrants 
(sometimes called "blanket" or "program" warrants). Basket warrants raise major 
Fourth Amendment concerns as they do not require specific individuals be the 
targets of suspicion. The ACLU is asking the Committees to amend the RESTORE Act 
to include individual warrants.
<p>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</p>
<p>"Allowing blanket warrants to be reviewed only once a year by a secret court 
doesn’t come anywhere close to the rigorous privacy safeguards Americans 
deserve. We urge both committees to examine Representative Rush Holt’s bill, 
‘The FISA Modernization Act of 2007’ if they are looking for legislation that 
can pass constitutional muster.</p>
<p>"Congress is under no obligation to pass either of these bills - it can let 
the disastrous Protect America Act expire. When the bill expires in February, 
FISA will still be intact and will allow for surveillance. If Congress is 
determined to pass legislation to fix the Protect America Act instead of letting 
it expire, then civil liberties concerns must be addressed. We urge the 
committees to not let politics trump policy and to stand up for the document 
they swore to uphold - the Constitution.</p>
<p>"The ACLU adamantly opposes any provision that would give telcom companies 
amnesty for their role in warrantless wiretapping program. The telecom companies 
broke the law while aiding the administration in the illegal domestic spying 
program and should not be let off the hook for their role. The Administration 
has refused to comply with requests from Congress to provide the legal rationale 
behind the program, effectively digging its heels in like a spoiled child. 
Congress should not be in the habit of rewarding the behavior of an overzealous 
and overreaching executive branch. It certainly should not be offering amnesty 
to private corporations that violated the Fourth Amendment rights of its 
customers. The telecom companies broke the law and violated the Constitution and 
they must face the consequences."</p>
