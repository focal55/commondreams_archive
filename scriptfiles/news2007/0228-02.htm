<p>SAN FRANCISCO – February 28 - The Stop Funding the War Coalition (http://www.stopfundingthewar.org), an ad hoc coalition of Bay Area community organizations and concerned citizens that oppose the war in Iraq, announced plans today for a 12 PM (noon) rally on Monday, March 19, 2007 in front of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office at the San Francisco Federal Building at 450 Golden Gate Avenue.  

<p>This rally is part of a national campaign called for by United for Peace and Justice (http://www.unitedforpeace.org) directed at members of Congress during the month leading up to the 4th Anniversary of the war in Iraq (March 19, 2007), calling on Congress to act now to end the war by cutting off the funds.  The goal of the event organizers is to pressure Speaker Pelosi to use her position to persuade Congress to replace President Bush's request for an additional $93 billion for the war in Iraq with an appropriation to safely return our troops home. 

<p>Confirmed speakers at the rally include: 

<p>John Caldera<br>

Veterans Community Action Network

<p>Peter Camejo<br>
Green Party California Gubernatorial Candidate, 2006

<p>Matt Gonzalez<br>
Attorney and former President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors

<p>George Johnson<br>
"Annie and the Vets"

<p>Rabbi Michael Lerner<br>
Tikkun Community

<p>Ross Mirkarimi<br>
San Francisco Supervisor, District 5

<p>Sean O'Neill<br>
Iraq Veterans Against the War, Berkeley Chapter

<p>Justin Raimondo<br>
Editorial Director, Antiwar.com

<p>Leslie Cagan, National Coordinator of United for Peace and Justice, said, "We will not quietly sit by as the President takes steps to further escalate the war in Iraq. We are outraged that in direct contradiction to the will of the people of this country as expressed during the November midterm elections, Bush remains committed to his failed policy in Iraq. The antiwar movement is launching a campaign calling on Congress to stand up to the President. When the President and his allies in the Republican Party can block a non-binding resolution merely expressing opposition to the war's escalation, the time for timidity in Congress is long past. It is time for Congress to use its power and cut the funds for this immoral war."

<p>"The most supportive thing that Congress can do for our troops is end the war in Iraq by using their 'power of the purse' to de-fund it," said Nancy Lessin, co-founder of Military Families Speak Out. "Senators and Members of Congress can not simultaneously oppose and fund this war. All those who do vote for funds to continue the war in Iraq need to understand that this war will no longer be George Bush's war, it will be their's. If they fund it, they own it."
