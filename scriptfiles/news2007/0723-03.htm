<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 23 -League of Conservation Voters (LCV) President Gene Karpinski issued the following statement regarding tonight's Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, South Carolina:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><br>"Tonight's Democratic Presidential Debate hosted by CNN and YouTube marks a significant new day for presidential debates.&nbsp; For the first time in our nation's history, citizens will be able to ask the presidential candidates questions about the issues that are most important to them via video.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>So far, well over 100 people have submitted questions relating to global warming and energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to know: Do the candidates have a plan to curb global warming?&nbsp; Do they support a national cap on global warming pollution?&nbsp; Where do they stand on renewable energy?&nbsp; How will they get our country on track toward a clean energy future?<br>&nbsp;<br>Poll after poll demonstrates that the American people want to see leadership on global warming.&nbsp; In South Carolina, Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike want to hear how each candidate would address this challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>We urge the sponsors of tonight's debate to lift the voices of the millions of Americans concerned about global warming by selecting video questions concerning this challenge.&nbsp; We look forward to continued conversation among the candidates on the best solutions to address global warming and our nation's energy future.</p>
