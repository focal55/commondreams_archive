<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 28 - For the sixth time this year a retired D.C. public school teacher will risk arrest for nonviolent protest against the war and occupation of Iraq.<br><br>Eve Tetaz, 75, of 17th Street, N.W. will openly demonstrate in the forbidden "picture postcard" zone in front of the White House Friday at about 12:30 pm. She has described the protest as one of mourning for lives lost during the war in Iraq.<br><br>In May, Tetaz violated a stay away order from the Hart Senate Office Building, and was arrested as soon as she entered the building with a group of peace activists. She faces a contempt of court trial on that matter, and could face at least a month in jail. Also in May, she was arrested with peace mom Cindy Sheehan and 31 other protesters while nonviolently blocking Independence and New Jersey Avenues, SE.<br><br>Her stay away order has been expanded to encompass all of Capitol Hill.<br><br>"I am unable to comply with these orders, and after careful and prayerful consideration, have decided to take the initiative by deciding the circumstances under which I will begin serving my sentence," Tetaz said. "I am following in the tradition of others. There are many who have chosen to speak truth to power in this fashion."<br><br>On July 9th, Tetaz will again appear in D.C. Superior Court for an earlier nonviolent protest inside the Hart Senate Office Building. She was arrested along with six other protesters on March 29th. This nonviolent action occurred the same hour the Senate approved additional monies for the war and occupation of Iraq.<br><br>A retired D.C. public schoolteacher for 30 years, Tetaz is the founder of Life Pathways, a non-profit organization helping single parents become financially independent and trained in the field of health care. She is a member of the Church of the Savior, and has been an advocate for the poor on issues of economics and social justice.
