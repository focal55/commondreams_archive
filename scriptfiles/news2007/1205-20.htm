<p>WASHINGTON - December 5 -     Amnesty International USA's executive director Larry Cox issued the following comments regarding the cases Boumediene v. Bush and Al Oadah v. United States currently before the United States Supreme Court:
<P></P>
"Once again we are witnessing the need for an independent check on executive action as the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments about detentions in Guantanamo Bay and whether the Military Commission Act (MCA) unlawfully stripped detainees of their right to habeas corpus.  The right to challenge one's detention is not a technical nicety; it is a basic safeguard against government abuse.  
<P></P>
"This is a crucial moment for the rule of law and human rights, as the key questions before the Court are not only about the rights of detainees but the very basic foundations of an accountable government.
<P></P>
"Amnesty International filed an amicus curiae brief with the Court arguing that international laws and standards provide a seamless framework of legal protection for all individuals and that these laws are relevant to the construction of the MCA.
<P></P>
"The Supreme Court has twice delivered the message to the Bush administration that judicial review and civil liberties cannot be discarded.  Yet President Bush continues to operate in a bubble where even such rulings can be manipulated to continue avoiding and delaying justice.  It's time, Mr. President, to end your disgraceful attempts to circumvent one of the most valued and fundamental rights of our country and realize that the rule of law is paramount."
<P></P>
