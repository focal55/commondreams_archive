<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - A statement from The Center for Democracy in the Americas describes a textbook example of how our policy toward Cuba undermines the national interest, when a federal judge frees an anti-Cuba terrorist, Luis Posada Carriles, while the Bush administration places the film director, Michael Moore, under investigation for taking ailing 9/11 rescue workers for free health care treatment in Cuba:

 

<P></P>“This week the government freed an anti-Castro terrorist, the mastermind behind the bombing of a Cuban airplane, and made public its investigation of a film director because he took sick Americans to Cuba for free health care.  This is a textbook example, and a tragic example, of how U.S. policy toward Cuba undermines our national interest and our common values.

 

<P></P>“The first terrorist attack in this hemisphere targeting an aircraft was perpetrated by Luis Posada Carriles against a Cuban airliner, and the United States, with our own experience with airborne terror, should be certifying Posada as a terrorist and detaining him, not allowing him to go free. Posada’s release sends a terrible signal to the rest of the world about our credibility in the fight against terrorism and whether we operate with a double standard when it comes to terrorists and Cuba.  It is our hope that other on-going investigations of Posada are conducted with greater vigor and care.

 

<P></P>“The United States needs a new foreign policy toward Cuba that begins with repeal of travel restrictions on all Americans wanting to travel to Cuba – for medical care, for visiting their families, or simply exercising their constitutional rights to travel without asking their government for a license or its permission to do so.”

 

<P></P>The Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) is devoted to changing U.S. policy toward the countries of the Americas by basing our relations on respect and dignity, particularly with those governments and movements with which U.S. policy is at odds.  CDA, <a href="http://www.democracyinamericas.org/" target="_new">http://www.democracyinamericas.org/</a>, runs the Freedom to Travel to Cuba campaign.
