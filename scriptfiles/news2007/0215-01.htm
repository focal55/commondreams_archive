<p>A wide range of national political organizations, academics, activists and writers will gather this weekend in New York City for an Emergency Summit to develop national strategy for impeaching George W. Bush for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  
<p>Speakers and participants include Dennis Loo, Ramsey Clark, Cindy Sheehan, Debra Sweet, Ted Glick, Sunsara Taylor, Liam Madden, Bob Fertik, Daphne Wysham, Steve Cobble, Laura Flanders (Air America radio) and many others. World Can't Wait -- Drive Out the Bush Regime initiated the Summit and are joined by the Green Party, Progressive Democrats of America, Democrats.com, Code Pink Afterdowningstreet.org, Hip Hop Caucus and many more.
	
	<p>Debra Sweet, director of World Can’t Wait– Drive Out the Bush Regime spoke about why this is an emergency summit: “An illegal war in Iraq spinning out of control, legalized torture, NSA spying – these constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. The program of the Bush administration must be repudiated by removing him from office before his term expires, or the whole direction he is taking society will be legitimated and made permanent.”

<p>•		Become an Expert in the Bush Regime's Crimes <br>

•		Strategies & Grounds for Impeachment <br>

•		Legal Action Against Bush and Cheney <br>

•		Make Hip-Hop, Not War <br>

•		Why the U.S. has Iran in its sights: How do we Stop an Attack on Iran? <br>
