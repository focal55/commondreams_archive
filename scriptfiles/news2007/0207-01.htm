<p>NEW YORK - February 7 - United
for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), the nation's largest grassroots antiwar
coalition, today announced plans for a major nationwide effort to pressure
Congress to reject President Bush's request for an additional $93 billion for
the war in Iraq.</p>


<p>In the coming weeks, as
Congress discusses and eventually votes on this additional funding for the war,
United for Peace and Justice will undertake a national campaign directed at
members of Congress. Elements of this campaign will include:</p>


<p>- Meetings and protest
activities at district offices of members of Congress during the recess they
are scheduled to take the week of Feb. 19th.</p>


<p>- Organizing town hall
meetings, gatherings in religious institutions and community centers, and other
sessions where people can learn more about the role of Congress and the power it has to end the war.</p>


<p>- An effort to bring
our message into local media outlets.</p>


<p>- Using appearances of
the 2008 presidential hopefuls as opportunities to raise the antiwar voice.</p>


<p>Leslie Cagan, National
Coordinator of UFPJ, said, "We will not quietly sit by as the President
takes steps to further escalate the war in Iraq. We are outraged that in direct contradiction to
the will of the people of this country as expressed during the November midterm
elections, Bush remains committed to his failed policy in Iraq. The antiwar movement is launching a campaign
calling on Congress to stand up to the President. When the President and his
allies in the Republican Party can block a non-binding resolution merely expressing
opposition to the war's escalation, the time for timidity in Congress is long
past. It is time for Congress to use its power and cut the funds for this
immoral war."</p>


<p>On Jan. 27th hundreds
of thousands of people from at least 47 states gathered in Washington, DC, in an antiwar demonstration organized by United
for Peace and Justice. On that day, a clear, strong message was sent to
Congress: You have the power to end the war and bring the troops home, and we
demand that you use it! In an unprecedented event, the march encircled
the Capitol building and grounds in their entirety. In addition, antiwar
protests were held in some 100 other cities and towns across the nation. And on
Monday, Jan. 29th, at least 1,000 people had meetings with over 400
Congressional offices in what was one of the largest lobby days on any issue in
recent memory.</p>


<p>"The most supportive
thing that Congress can do for our troops is end the war in Iraq by using their
'power of the purse' to de-fund it," said Nancy Lessin, co-founder of Military
Families Speak Out, which sits on UFPJ's Steering Committee. "Senators and
Members of Congress can not simultaneously oppose <i>and</i> fund this war. All those who do vote for funds to continue
the war in Iraq need to understand that this war will no longer be
George Bush's war, it will be theirs. If they fund it, they own it." </p>

of United for Peace and Justice on the President's request for additional war
funds and antiwar movement plans to oppose that request, contact Sue Udry or Hany
