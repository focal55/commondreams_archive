<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 23 - The following is a
statement by MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Eli Pariser:
<P></P>Voters elected Democrats in November to lead the way out of the mess in
Iraq, but the supplemental bill to be voted on this week won't end the war.
There are no real timelines or real accountability for the Bush
administration -- just a blank check for an endless war.
  <P></P>  A vote for this bill is a vote to continue President Bush's failed Iraq
policy, and we'll be urging every last member of Congress to vote against
it.
   <P></P> MoveOn members are asking us to consider all options for Democratic
members of Congress who ran on ending the war but vote for more chaos and
more troops in Iraq -- including in-district advertising and recruitment of
primary challengers.
  <P></P> And we'll work hard so that Republicans who refuse to listen to the
country on Iraq face a great political backlash in their home districts.
   <P></P> In an email this morning, MoveOn encouraged all 3.2 million of its
members to urge Congress to vote no. In part, the email reads: "Every
single Democrat must vote against this bill. This is a key test vote on
whether your representative is serious about ending the war." The email was
sent by MoveOn's Nita Chaudhary.<br>
