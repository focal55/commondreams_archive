<p>IRAQ- JULY 18 <br>
<b><a href="mailto:david.enders@gmail.com"><br>
DAVID ENDERS</a></b><br>
Available for a limited number of interviews from Baghdad, Enders is a freelance journalist who has spent more than 18 months in Iraq over the past four years. He is author of the book <i>Baghdad Bulletin</i>. Enders said today: "The last time I was here was in May 2006. It's never been this hard to move around in Baghdad. ... From what I have seen, the control exercised by some of the militias seems to be greater than I've ever seen. ... The situation seems to be leading to increased fragmentation rather than moving towards a cohesive state. I have yet to speak to anyone who said that security has gotten better -- most people I spoke to say that they would leave the country if they could."<br>
<br>
Enders also stated: "The main opposition to the oil law is due to the foreign rights. As it is written now, many people feel that it would be giving up a key piece of Iraqi sovereignty."<br>
