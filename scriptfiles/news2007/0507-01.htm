<p>Port Moresby - May 7 - Greenpeace activists today abseiled 
from the top of the Crowne Plaza hotel in downtown Port Moresby, where 
delegates were gathering for the start of the 42nd International 
Tropical Timber Organization’s (ITTO) committee meeting, and unfurled a 
banner which read “ITTO Stop Forest Destruction”.

<P></P>Dutch climber Erik Birkhoff said, “Greenpeace wants the ITTO to do more 
to stop forest destruction in the world’s tropical forests.”

<P></P>The protection of large expanses of rainforest has become a global issue 
and was identified by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change) last week as one of the most cost-effective ways to mitigate 
against climate change.

<P></P>Greenpeace is highlighting the issue of tropical forest destruction as 
representatives from governments meet at the 42nd ITTO meeting in Port 
Moresby, Papua New Guinea, a country with serious illegal and 
destructive logging issues, to challenge the ITTO's members to protect 
rather than trade away the planet's last ancient forests. (1)

<P></P>A diagnostic report on PNG by the ITTO concluded that the PNG Forest 
Authority (PNGFA) is doing nothing on ensuring sustainable forest 
management and is focussed “almost exclusively on exploitation of the 
forest resource for the primary financial benefit of the national 
government.”(2)

<P></P>“Greenpeace wants the ITTO to do more to stop forest destruction in 
PNG,” said Sam Moko, Greenpeace PNG forest campaigner and climber. “Our 
Government has done nothing to protect our forests. They and the forest 
industry are more interested in short term financial gain rather than 
thinking about the future for our children.”

<P></P>The ITTO was formed to find a balance between tropical forest 
conservation and sustainable management, use and trade of tropical 
forest resources. However the world’s tropical forests, including the 
Amazon, Congo and the Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific continue to be 
logged at alarming rates.

<P></P>In 1990, the ITTO set a goal, “Objective 2000”, to ensure that the trade 
in tropical timber comes from sustainably managed forests by 2000. As of 
June 2006, according to the ITTO’s own assessment, less than 5 per cent 
of tropical forests were under sustainable management.(3)

<P></P>“By its own admission the ITTO is failing, in the 20 years it has been 
operating forest degradation and loss due to logging has accelerated in 
ITTO member countries rather than being brought under control,” said 
Greenpeace New Zealand Forest Campaigner Grant Rosoman. “This is a 
spectacular failure and points to the underlying aim of the ITTO members 
– the continued exploitation of forests for the trade in tropical timber.”

<P></P>Tropical forests are some of the most bio-diverse ecosystems on the 
planet and are home to millions of people who rely on them for their 
subsistence and survival. They are also an essential carbon reservoir 
and their continued destruction is contributing to climate change. Up to 
25% of greenhouse gas
emissions come from tropical forest clearance.(4)
Since the ITTO announced its “Objective 2000” the world’s tropical 
forests have come under increased pressure from illegal and destructive 
logging as well as massive clearance for agricultural crops such as soya 
and oil palm.

<P></P>Sixty per cent of PNG's large intact ancient forests have already been 
destroyed (5) and Greenpeace estimates that over 90 per cent of logging 
in PNG is illegal. Between August 2000 and August 2005 the Amazon lost 
12.8 million hectares of forest. (6) Indonesia was last week confirmed 
as a Guinness World Record holder for destroying its forests at the 
fastest rate and the Democratic Republic of Congo risks losing up to 40 
per cent of its forests by 2050.(7)

<P></P>“Unless something is done now to stop wholesale forest destruction there 
may be nothing left to save. Instead of more talk the ITTO’s members 
need to take action to protect the world’s last ancient forests,” said 
Mr Rosoman. “We are calling on governments of forest countries to 
immediately implement moratoria on the expansion of industrial logging 
and set up a network of protected forest areas. Governments of market 
countries must implement legislation to ensure that their markets are 
not trading in illegal and destructive timber products.”
