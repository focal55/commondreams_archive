<p>WASHINGTON - February 2 - Exxon set the
record for the largest annual corporate profit of $39.5 billion last year
even with a 4% decline in fourth-quarter profit resulting in part from an
18% drop in refining margins, according to the company's profit report
today. Shell, the world's second largest oil company, set a company record
earning $25.4 billion in 2006 but also announced a 23% decline in refining
margins. Pump prices have increased dramatically in recent years following
industry wide increases in refining margins.
<p>   The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR) said today's
earnings reports show that industry leaders cut domestic refining profits
in the run-up to the November election in order to lower gasoline prices,
very likely hoping to influence the mid-term election. The nonpartisan
group is calling for Congressional investigations to determine whether
Exxon and others manipulated the market to effect the election.
<p>    Read FTCR's early analysis of how oil companies could have wielded gas
prices for political impact
<a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2007/01/02/PM200701026.html">http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2007/01/02/PM200701026.html</a><p>   FTCR noted that, despite the temporary and limited relief of election
season pump prices, the record annual profits of Exxon and Shell show once
again that last summer motorists were the victims of one of the greatest
rip- offs of all time when gasoline prices topped $3 per gallon. The
industry has long claimed that gasoline pump prices are attributable to
external factors such as the price of crude oil, but today's profit data
make it clear that high gasoline prices are directly tied to oil company
decisions.
<p>    "The proof in Exxon's profit report is that oil companies are robbing
Americans blind and that the companies can have tremendous influence over
gasoline prices at any time they want simply by taking a little less in
profits," said FTCR President Jamie Court. "That's a very different
portrait than the industry paints of being captive to global economic
forces. Congress needs to hold hearings and ask company executives under
oath about whether Exxon's sudden profit drop in the fourth quarter was
based on a political motivation and subpoena company documents to determine
the root of the change."
<p>  Similar Results Throughout Industry
<p>  Marathon oil, the fifth largest U.S. refiner announced today a 30% drop
in refining margins and an overall 4th quarter decline in profit. Still,
the company announced a 75% increase in profits over 2005. Last week Conoco
Phillips announced a 16% drop in fourth quarter profits. Like Exxon and
Shell, the decrease in profits and gasoline prices in October and November,
were easily offset for these companies by the enormous refining margins and
high pump prices of prior quarters.
<p>   Exxon Produced More Gasoline in 4th Quarter, Made Less Money
<p> According to its earnings report, Exxon increased its refinery
throughput (thus producing more, cheaper gasoline for motorists) in the
fourth quarter by 10% over the fourth quarter of 2005 year, even though
annual refinery throughput actually declined from 2005 to 2006. Although
Exxon refined and sold substantially more gasoline in the fourth quarter
than in prior quarters, the company's quarterly income associated with
refining and sales were $327 million dollars less than in the third quarter
of 2006 and $409 million less than the second quarter, during the height of
driving season and the 2006 price spike. This provides more evidence that
the oil industry manipulated the available supply of gasoline in order to
lower prices last autumn.
<p> President's Announcement on Strategic Petroleum Reserves Helped
Industry
<p>  After President Bush promised in his State of the Union to double the
size of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, oil prices shot up faster
than after Katrina. FTCR has questioned whether Bush was pumping up oil
prices for companies that dropped gasoline prices in the run up to the Nov.
election. See FTCR's analysis after a similar profit report by Conoco
Phillips http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/energy/pr/?postId=7320.
