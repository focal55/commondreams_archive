<p>Washington, DC — Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) today has released a report, <strong><em>WITHOUT A TRACE: The Missing White House Emails and the Violations of the Presidential Records Act</em></strong>,&nbsp;detailing the legal issues behind the story of the White House e-mail scandal. </p>

<p>In a startling new revelation, CREW has also learned through two
confidential sources that the Executive Office of the President (EOP)
has lost over five million emails generated between March 2003 and
October 2005. The White House counsel’s office was advised of these
problems in 2005 and CREW has been told that the White House was given
a plan of action to recover these emails, but to date nothing has been
done to rectify this significant loss of records. </p>
<p>Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said today, “It’s clear
that the White House has been willfully violating the law, the only
question now is to what extent? The ever changing excuses offered by
the administration – that they didn’t want to violate the Hatch Act,
that staff wasn’t clear on the law – are patently ridiculous. Very
convenient that embarrassing – and potentially incriminating – emails
have gone missing. It’s the Nixon White House all over again.” </p>
<p><strong><em>WITHOUT A TRACE</em></strong> covers the following areas: </p>
<p><strong>Presidential Records Act (PRA):</strong> &nbsp;Enacted in
1978, requires the president to preserve all presidential records,
which are defined as those records relating to the “activities,
deliberations, decisions, and policies that reflect the performance of
[the president’s] constitutional, statutory, or other official or
ceremonial duties. . .” </p>
<p><strong>Clinton Administration Policy:</strong> In 1993,
then-Assistant to the President and Staff Secretary John Podesta sent a
memo to all presidential staff explaining that the PRA required all
staff members to maintain all records, including emails. Podesta stated
that the use of external email networks was prohibited because records
would not be saved as required. The 1997 White House Manual and a 2000
memo issued by Mark Lindsay, then Assistant to the President for
Management and Administration echoed this policy, requiring staff to
use only the White House email system for official communications. </p>
<p><strong>Bush Administration Policy:</strong> The Bush Administration
has refused to make public its record-keeping policy. A confidential
source provided CREW with a 2002 document indicating the use of
“non-EOP messaging-enabled mechanisms should not be used for official
business.” </p>

<p><strong>Bush Administration Practice:</strong> In the wake of the
scandals surrounding Jack Abramoff and the fired U.S. Attorneys, emails
were released showing that top White House staffers routinely used
Republican National Committee (RNC) email accounts to conduct official
business. For example, J. Scott Jennings, White House Deputy Political
Director, used an RNC account to communicate with the former chief of
staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales regarding the appointments
of new U.S. Attorneys. Similarly, Susan Ralston, a former aide to Karl
Rove, used RNC email accounts to communicate with Abramoff about
appointments to the Department of the Interior. </p>
<p><strong>PRA Violations:</strong> 1) The administration failed to
implement adequate record-keeping systems to archive presidential email
records; 2) two confidential sources independently informed CREW that
the administration abandoned a plan to recover more than five million
missing emails; 3) White House staff used outside email accounts to
conduct presidential business, ensuring that emails were not adequately
preserved. In fact, former Abramoff associate Kevin Ring said in an
email to Abramoff that Ralston had told him not to send emails to her
official White House account “because it might actually limit what they
can do to help us, especially since there could be lawsuits, etc.” </p>
<p><strong>Hatch Act Excuse:</strong> The administration has claimed
that Rove, Jennings and other staffers use RNC accounts to avoid
violating the Hatch Act. This is untrue. The Hatch Act prohibits White
House staff from using official resources for purely “political”
purposes. “Political” refers to the president’s role as either a
candidate for office or as the leader of his party. Email
communications regarding presidential appointments for U.S. Attorney
and Interior Department positions clearly fall within the PRA as making
appointment is an official presidential function and does not relate to
the president’s role as party leader. </p>
