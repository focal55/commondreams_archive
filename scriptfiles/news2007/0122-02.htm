<p>WASHINGTON - January 22 - A public university is right to deny funding to a student group that discriminates on the basis of religion and sexual orientation, according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
<P>In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Americans United argues that Hastings College of Law, a part of the University of California system, does not have to officially recognize and support a student organization that excludes law students who do not subscribe to a certain type of Christianity or are gay. </P>
<P>&#8220;Public universities are under no obligation to subsidize student religious organizations that discriminate,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#8220;In fact, state schools have a duty to ensure that they do not aid the mission of religious organizations. Hastings Law School is on the right legal track, and the federal courts ought to say so.&#8221;</P>
<P>A student chapter of the Christian Legal Society (CLS) at Hastings has brought a lawsuit demanding an exemption from the law school&#8217;s Nondiscrimination Policy. The policy states that all student groups that seek official recognition and direct financial support must not deny membership based on a student&#8217;s race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex and sexual orientation. </P>
<P>The CLS affiliate argues that its religious liberty is being violated by the requirement.</P>
<P>Last year, a federal district court disagreed with the Christian student group&#8217;s arguments and upheld the school&#8217;s right to enforce its nondiscrimination policy. The CLS has asked the 9th Circuit to reverse the lower court&#8217;s ruling.</P>
<P>In its 30-page brief in <EM>Christian Legal Society Chapter v. Mary Kay Kane</EM>, Americans United argues that the university&#8217;s anti-discrimination policy applies equally to all student groups and that the CLS has no constitutional right to demand special treatment by the university. </P>
<P>Citing federal court precedent, Americans United&#8217;s brief notes that state institutions must not treat religious organizations more favorably than non-religious ones. </P>
<P>The brief, filed Jan. 19, further argues that exempting the Christian student legal group from the anti-discrimination policy would amount to providing preferential treatment to the religious group because &#8220;unlike all other campus groups, religious or secular,&#8221; the CLS would be able to discriminate and still receive state funds.</P>
<P>The brief was authored by attorneys Archis A. Parasharami, Lauren R. Randell and Evan M. Tager of the Washington, D.C., office of the global law firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw LLP, under the supervision of Americans United attorneys Ayesha N. Khan, Richard B. Katskee and Alex J. Luchenitser. </P>
<P>According to AU, the university&#8217;s anti-discrimination policy does not violate the religious liberty rights of the Christian student group. The CLS, under the school&#8217;s policy, can still advocate its religious beliefs and use campus facilities to meet and spread those beliefs, but without receiving tax dollars.</P>
<P>&#8220;The law school&#8217;s policy against discriminatory practices does not harm the religious expression rights of the CLS,&#8221; said Luchenitser, Americans United&#8217;s senior litigation counsel. &#8220;The school&#8217;s policy treats all student groups the same. If the Christian Legal Society chapter wishes to receive school financing, it must play by the same rules that other state groups do.&#8221;</P>
<P id='aboutau"'>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom. </P>
