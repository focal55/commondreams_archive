<p>SAN FRANCISCO - February 1 - In response to growing constituent concerns about identity theft, twenty-six states have adopted laws in recent years that allow consumers to freeze access to their credit files to prevent crooks from opening fraudulent accounts using stolen information.  Now lawmakers in another sixteen states are working to give more consumers the right to initiate a security freeze to thwart identity thieves.  </p>

<p>“Every year, millions of Americans become victims of identity theft, which can wreak havoc on their financial futures,” said Gail Hillebrand, Director of Consumers Union’s Financial Privacy Now campaign.  “Consumers in more than half of the states have the right to freeze identity thieves out of their credit files and many more states are moving to offer this protection.  A security freeze is a powerful safeguard because it enables consumers to protect themselves before they become victims of identity theft.”    </p>

<p>Creditors aren’t required to verify the identity of all individuals applying for credit, which makes it easier for thieves to use stolen information to open fraudulent accounts.  With just a person’s  name and Social Security number, a crook can open a credit account and start charging away, leaving behind a trail of unpaid bills that can ruin the victim’s credit record.     </p>

<p>A security freeze enables the consumer to block anyone from looking at his or her own credit reporting file for purposes of granting credit unless the consumer chooses to allow it.  This gives consumers complete control over who has access to the information needed to process a credit application in their name, which prevents crooks from opening fraudulent credit accounts and other accounts.  When the consumer is applying for credit, the freeze can be lifted temporarily so legitimate applications for credit or services can be processed.    </p>

<p>“A security freeze puts consumers in control and let’s them decide who gets to see their credit files when it comes to applying for credit,” said Hillebrand.    “It’s like putting a deadbolt on your front door so crooks are stopped cold.”</p>

<p>Security freeze bills that would allow all consumers to exercise this safeguard have been introduced in Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.  Lawmakers in other states are expected to introduce security freeze bills soon.  For more information on the bills introduced so far, see:  <u><strong><a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/finance/SecurityBills_2007.htm ">http://www.consumersunion.org/finance/SecurityBills_2007.htm </a></u></p>

<p>Consumers in twenty states currently have the right to put a security freeze on their credit files: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  Utah’s security freeze law for all consumers will go into effect in 2008.   </p>

<p>An additional five states give consumers the right to put a security freeze on credit files after they become identity theft victims:  Hawaii, Kansas, Texas, South Dakota, and Washington.  For more information on existing state security freeze laws, see:  <u><strong><a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/securityfreeze.htm">http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/securityfreeze.htm</a></u></p>

<p>Consumers Union has called on the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies to inform  consumers who live in states with security freeze laws about their rights.  Consumers Union also has urged Congress to adopt a national security freeze safeguard that is low cost, easy to use, and easy to lift when applying for new accounts or services.     </p>
