<p>DETROIT - October 22 - Climate change activists, students and the<a href="http://www.jumpstartford.com/" target="_new"> Freedom From Oil</a> Campaign's Oil Enforcement Agency (OEA) unfurled a dramatic 15-foot banner on the Rinke Toyota dealership in Centerline, Mich. today. The group accused Toyota of "driving war and warming" and challenged mega-dealer Penske Automotive Group to demand that its suppliers - like Toyota - improve their fleetwide fuel economy and reduce global warming pollution.
<p></p>
The banner was draped from Rinke Toyota for 20 minutes before police removed it and arrested two of the activists for trespassing.
<p></p>
Said Mike Hudema of Global Exchange: "Toyota can't have it both ways; Toyota can't call itself an environmental leader while fighting legislation to curb greenhouse gas pollution and accelerating into the truck market."
<p></p>
With more than 300 dealerships and hundreds of maintenance and service outlets, Penske Auto Group is a mainstay of the automobile industry. The Freedom From Oil Campaign is urging Penske to join mega-dealer AutoNation in taking "soft orders" for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles, publicly supporting an increase in fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles per gallon by 2012, and setting a goal to increase the fuel economy of all vehicles sold at its dealerships.
<p></p>
"Our dependence on oil is the leading cause of war and climate change," said Jodie Van Horn, a campaigner for Rainforest Action Network. "For our planet, our national security and our children's futures, it is time for mega-dealers and the auto industry to stop saying what they can't do to improve fuel efficiency and to start shifting into high gear and offering real solutions."
<p></p>
Car and truck tailpipe emissions are a leading cause of global warming, accounting for a quarter of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, consumers are shifting from gas-guzzling SUVs to more fuel-efficient vehicles en masse. The Freedom From Oil campaign is pressuring mega-dealers to take the demands of their customers to the auto industry.
<p></p>
This morning's protest coincided with <a href="http://www.nowarnowarming.org/" target="_new">No War No Warming</a> actions taking place on Capitol Hill today, in which hundreds of activists from anti-war, justice and clean energy groups are highlighting the connections between resource wars and global warming.
