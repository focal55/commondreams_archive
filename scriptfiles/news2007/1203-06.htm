<p>PAKISTAN - December 3 -Medea Benjamin and Tighe Barry, members of the U.S. human rights
group Global Exchange and the women's peace group CODEPINK, conducted
a 24-hour vigil outside the home of Aitzaz Ahsan as a protest against
the lawyer's continued detention. The jailers placed outside his home
refused to let the visiting activists meet with him.
<P></P>
 Even worse, the 30-day detention against Mr. Ahsan--set to expire on
December 2—was renewed for another 30 days. Upon hearing the news, Mr.
Atizaz, his family and the activists camped outside his door were
devastated.
<P></P>
 "We strongly condemn the continued detention of Mr. Ahsan. If Pervez
Musharraf is committed to democracy and fair elections, then why does
he detain—without charges--a man who is not only the head of the
nation's Supreme Court Bar Association but also a candidate for the
National Assembly? That's just unacceptable," says U.S. activist Tighe
Barry.
<P></P>
 "Aitzaz Ahsan and the other lawyers and judges still under detention
must be released and reinstated before there can even be talk about
free and fair elections in Pakistan," says Medea Benjamin of CODEPINK
and Global Exchange. "The US government, if it wants to support
democracy in Pakistan, should be supporting the lawyers, journalists,
students and civil society, not Musharraf."
<P></P>
 Despite the disappointment of not seeing Mr. Ahsan, the two activists
who spent the night—in the cold—sleeping outside his home, left the
vigil feeling renewed. "We were amazed by the reaction of the
Pakistani people to our gesture of solidarity. All night long and then
again the next morning, people came on foot, bike and car to show
support for us," said Barry. "They brought us soup, tea, sandwiches,
sweets, flowers. It was so touching."
<P></P>
 "One woman who came to see us said, 'If someone shows us a little bit
of love, we'll shower them with love in return.' That is certainly
what we felt," says Benjamin. "We were visited by students,
businessmen, government workers, women with their young daughters
(dressed in pink), labor leaders, lawyers. A journalist came at 1am
with tea, cookies and warm jackets for us to wear. The police
stationed outside Mr. Ahsan's home built us a campfire to keep us
warm. We left the vigil in awe of the generosity, kindness we received
from the Pakistani people."<!-- #EndEditable -->
