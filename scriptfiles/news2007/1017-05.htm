<p>WASHINGTON - October 17 - As tensions mount between the Sri Lankan military and Tamil Tigers rebel group, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict today expressed concern for civilians and called on both warring parties to use restraint to stem potential civilian casualties.
<P></P>
According to the BBC, the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tiger rebels are preparing for what may erupt into a full-scale conflict. The areas at most risk are those surrounding rebel-held territories in the north, where sporadic but increasingly deadly violence has wreaked havoc among the civilian population since the collapse of February 2002 ceasefire agreement.
 <P></P>
"If the past is any indication, renewed violence is of grave concern for ordinary Sri Lankans trying to go about their lives,” said CIVIC’s executive director Sarah Holewinski. “Civilians have for years borne the brunt of hostilities between the government and Tamil Tigers, including serious human rights abuses committed by both sides.”
 <P></P>
CIVIC noted that Sri Lanka’s twenty-year civil war has caused an estimated 70,000 civilian casualties.  International law prohibits combatants from launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas and requires the avoidance of civilians to the greatest extent possible.  CIVIC also called for Sri Lanka’s warring parties to help any civilians harmed by their military operations, including allowing aid from humanitarian organizations safe passage to those in need.
 <P></P>
“Don’t harm civilians. That’s the rule,” said Holewinski. “But when a civilian is harmed, they or their family should be helped by the warring parties.  That’s the right thing to do.”
<P></P>
CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and helped by the warring parties involved.  In 2005, CIVIC's founder Marla Ruzicka was killed in Iraq by suicide bomb.  CIVIC honors her legacy and strives to sustain her vision.<!-- #EndEditable -->
