<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 - The ACLU continues to have serious concerns regarding the 
Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 (H.R. 
1955). Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the Washington Legislative Office of 
the ACLU said, "Law enforcement should focus on action, not thought. We need to 
worry about the people who are committing crimes rather than those who harbor 
beliefs that the government may consider to be extreme." </p>
<p>The framework established by the measure will unavoidably make the focus of 
the commission the bill creates more likely to lead to unconstitutional 
restrictions on speech and belief – in addition to more appropriate restrictions 
on actions. Experience has demonstrated that the results of such a study will 
likely be used to recommend the use of racial, ethnic and religious profiling, 
in the event of a terrorist attack. We believe this approach to be 
counter-productive, and it will only heighten, rather than decrease, the spread 
of radicalization.</p>

<p>The ACLU has raised multiple concerns with H.R. 1955 at different points 
during the last 13 months. We appreciate the steps that have been made to 
improve the legislation, but we still have reservations. As an organization 
dedicated to the principles of freedom of speech, we cannot in good conscience 
support this or any measure that might lead to censorship and persecution based 
solely on one’s personal beliefs. Fredrickson explained that during hearings on 
the legislation called, "Using the Web as a Weapon: the Internet as a Tool for Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism," the focus on the internet was 
problematic. "If Congress finds the Internet is dangerous, then the ACLU will 
have to worry about censorship and limitations on First Amendment activities. 
Why go down that road?" </p>
<p>The ACLU is working with senators to improve First Amendment and civil 
liberties protections in the Senate version of the legislation.
