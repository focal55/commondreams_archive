<p>DES MOINES - December 28 - On December 31, in Des Moines, Iowa, social justice and antiwar advocates will continue their campaign of nonviolent direct action, Seasons Of Discontent: a Presidential Occupation Project (SODaPOP) that began on November 8 with the "occupations" of campaign offices of Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani.  Nonviolent occupations will occur at the offices of Presidential candidates—both Democrats and Republicans—who do not publicly commit to a complete withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Iraq ; a cessation of all U.S. military action against Iraq (including air and land warfare); and to oppose any form of military action against Iran.
<p></p>
While the majority of Americans favor a quick withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, each of the leading candidates of both parties endorse plans that would keep thousands of troops there for the foreseeable future. "We're very respectful of the [Iowa] Caucus process and the long history behind it," said Voices for Creative Nonviolence (VCNV) coordinator Kathy Kelly at a rally at Nollen Plaza in Des Moines on November 8, "but we feel quite strongly that the issues of this war must be inserted into the process of narrowing down who the candidates for the presidential elections will be."
<p></p>
Eighteen activists from around the Midwest were arrested for criminal trespass in the campaign offices of Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton on November 8. Activists from around the nation will be joining local people in occupying more offices in the lead up to the Iowa Caucuses on January 3. The SODaPOP campaign will continue with occupations of pro-war candidates in other states
<p></p>
The <a href="http://vcnv.org/category/sodapop" target="_new">SODaPOP</a> campaign is organized by the Iowa Occupation Project and Voices for Creative Nonviolence.  Since February 5, 2007, over 400 arrests have occurred in the offices of over 40 Representatives and Senators throughout the United States.  The Occupation Project campaign seeks a public commitment to vote against additional funding for the Iraq war.  Nonviolent civil resistance has occurred several times at the offices of Iowa Senators Harkin and Grassley.  SODaPOP aims to bring the Occupation Project into the Presidential campaign. <!-- #EndEditable -->
