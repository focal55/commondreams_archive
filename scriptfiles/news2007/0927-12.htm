<p>  HAMBURG/LONDON - September 27 –“The onslaught against the demonstrators makes it imperative for the international community to act urgently. We need to send the Burmese military government a clear message that there will be dire costs if they repeat the violent repression of 1988. In addition, the international community must call for the end of the arbitrary detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners”

 <P></P>

She went on to say “The Burmese government has a duty to fully respect the right of the demonstrators to peacefully express their opinion. China, Japan and India have a critical role to play as permanent members of the UN Security Council and governments with political influence over Burma”.
 <P></P>
 

World Future Council member David Krieger, president of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, stated, "Citizens and governments throughout the world must take a stand in supporting the peaceful demonstrations in Burma, stopping the bloodshed there and assuring that the human rights of the Burmese people to peacefully assemble and speak out are upheld.  This is an issue of urgent global concern that requires immediate intervention by the United Nations Security Council."
 <P></P>
 

Fellow members of the World Future Council, Cyd Ho and Hafsat Abiola said “We are dismayed to see civil protest suppressed by bullets and tear gas. We call on the Burmese Authorities to desist from the violent suppression of protests, and from harming or killing protesters as these acts violate the rights of the people of Myanmar to freedom of expression and will cost the government what goodwill it has within and outside Myanmar”
 <P></P>
 

The WFC fully supports calls from Amnesty International for the United Nations Security Council to immediately send a mission to Burma. “The intervention is being urged to help resolve Burma’s human rights crisis and avert the risk of violence and bloodshed. The mission, Amnesty International believes, should also discuss with the Burmese authorities a resolution to the long-standing human rights problems in the country including the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners”, said a statement from Amnesty International

  <P></P>

The WFC condemns Burma’s appalling human rights record, which has been well documented by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. These widespread and systematic human rights violations include:

  <P></P>

* The holding of more than 1,160 political prisoners in deteriorating prison conditions. Detainees include most senior opposition figures
 <P></P>
* The use of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, especially during interrogation and pre-trial detention
 <P></P>
* The use of child soldiers and forced labour
 <P></P>
* Laws that criminalise the peaceful expression of political dissent
 <P></P>
* People frequently being arrested without warrant and held incommunicado
 <P></P>
* Judicial proceedings against political detainees that fall short of international fair trial standards
 <P></P>
* Defendants being denied the right to legal counsel and prosecutors relying on confessions extracted through torture
 <P></P>
