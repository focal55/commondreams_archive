<p>NEW YORK - November 5 - The 
U.S. government 
today appealed a New York federal 
court ruling striking down the National Security Letter (NSL) provision of the 
amended Patriot Act. </p>
<p>The appeal comes in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil 
Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a 
still-anonymous Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; The ISP received an NSL 
demanding private information about a client and imposing a “gag order” 
preventing the ISP from disclosing its identity as the recipient of an NSL. NSLs 
are used to obtain access to subscriber, billing or transactional records from 
ISPs, to obtain a wide array of financial and credit documents, and even to 
obtain library records – all without prior judicial review. </p>
<p>A March 2007 report from the Justice Department’s Inspector 
General found serious abuses of the NSL power by the FBI. More recently, 
documents received by the ACLU in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit revealed 
that the Department of Defense secretly issued hundreds of NSLs, suggesting an 
expanded military role in domestic surveillance. </p>
<p>In September, Judge Victor Marrero of the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New York found that the gag provisions of the NSL 
statute were unconstitutional because they violated the First Amendment and the 
principle of separation of powers. Ruling that the gag provisions could not be 
severed from the remainder of the NSL statute, Judge Marrero struck down the 
entire statute. The court stayed enforcement of its ruling pending the 
government’s anticipated appeal, which the government filed today. The ISP 
plaintiff has been under a gag order now for more than three years.</p>
<p>The following can be attributed to “John Doe,” the 
President of the plaintiff ISP:</p>
<p>“Recent reports that the FBI and Defense Department have 
abused the NSL statutes only confirm my belief that the statutes give the 
government far too much power and that the secrecy surrounding the statutes is 
excessive and dangerous.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the most harmful consequence of the gag provisions 
is that they make it difficult or impossible for people like me – people who 
have firsthand experience with the NSL statute – to discuss their specific 
concerns with the public, the press, and Congress. This seems to be 
counterintuitive to everything I assumed about this country’s commitment to free 
speech and the value of political discourse. </p>
<p>“It has been especially frustrating to be operating under a 
gag order while Congress is considering whether to grant immunity to 
telecommunication companies that illegally disclosed information to the NSA. It 
is unfathomable to me that Congress is considering granting immunity to these 
companies that acted illegally while those who resisted illegal demands are 
prohibited even from identifying themselves or explaining their actions 
publicly.”</p>

<p>The following can be attributed to Jameel Jaffer, Director 
of the ACLU’s National Security Project:</p>
<p>“In striking down the NSL statute, the District Court 
properly concluded that the FBI cannot constitutionally be given the authority 
to determine, without judicial oversight, which NSL recipients should be 
permitted to speak and which should be silenced. We are confident that the 
appellate court will reach the same conclusion.”
