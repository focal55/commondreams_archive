<p>WASHINGTON - August 30 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) released the following statement today on the two-year anniversary of the Hurricane Katrina disaster:<br><br>“This Administration is satisfied with an inadequate commitment to the residents of the Gulf Coast,” Kucinich said. “The Administration has done too little, too late. They have not made reconstruction a priority and have allowed a ‘wild, Wild West’ environment for the workers who are employed to do the clean-up and reconstruction.<br><br>“New Orleans’ evacuees who were given shelter in FEMA trailers were exposed to dangerous levels of formaldehyde. An Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigation revealed that FEMA’s official policy was one of ignorance in order to deny the moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety of thousands of citizens seeking shelter. Rather than take responsibility for sheltering and rehabilitating the survivors of one of the most tragic natural disasters in our recent history, this Administration chose to turn its head the other way.<br><br>“The Administration does not consider $40 billion to rebuild the levees to be a priority. Instead the President is asking Congress for almost $200 billion to continue an unjust and misguided war in Iraq that cannot be won militarily,” Kucinich said.<br><br>Kucinich has made New Orleans reconstruction and recovery a top priority. Here are actions he has taken since becoming Chairman of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee: &nbsp;<br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On June 26, 2007, the Domestic Policy Subcommittee held a hearing on the adequacy of labor law enforcement in the New Orleans metro area post-Katrina. Witnesses testified that the confluence of several labor law suspensions by the President and the influx of no-bid, cost-plus contracts created a “wild, wild West” environment in New Orleans that has subjected the workforce to hazardous working conditions and wage theft. <br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Domestic Policy Subcommittee submitted recommendations to Paul DeCamp, the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Administrator, on how to improve its advocacy efforts on behalf of the metro New Orleans workforce. Mr. DeCamp has yet to submit his response to the July 5, 2007, letter citing that it is yet to be cleared by the Congressional Budget Office. <br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Domestic Policy Subcommittee drafted recommendations for the consideration of the DOL and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as they draft regulations concerning H2-B visa holders, or non-agricultural guest workers, to do the reconstruction and recovery efforts. <br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Domestic Policy Subcommittee requested a performance audit of the DOL New Orleans District Office to be completed by the DOL Office of the Inspector General. The projected completion date of the audit is January 2008. <br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kucinich also chaired an Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) preparedness for the next catastrophic disaster. As demonstrated by the response to Hurricane Katrina, FEMA was not prepared for a disaster of catastrophic proportions. Two years later, FEMA is still “not there yet” according to the DHS Deputy Inspector General Matt Jadacki. <br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In response to the Congressman’s questions, R. David Paulison, FEMA’s Administrator admitted that FEMA had failed to consider the impact of global warming in its long-term planning. Mr. Paulison promised that FEMA would consider the predicted the effects of global warming in their future planning. <br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To ensure global warming is considered in planning for FEMA’s future resource demands, Kucinich inserted language in the Energy Bill that passed the House before recess requiring a comprehensive study to determine the increase in demand for FEMA’s emergency response and disaster relief services as a result of weather-related disasters associated with global warming.&nbsp; The assessment will include an analysis of the budgetary and manpower implications of meeting such increased demand for FEMA services. &nbsp;<br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Domestic Policy Subcommittee also submitted a request to DHS Deputy Inspector General Jadacki for a “readiness score card” rating FEMA’s readiness to respond to a catastrophic disaster. <br><br>“This government can do more for its people and the Administration needs to take action immediately to provide appropriate funding so Gulf Coast residents can reclaim their lives,” Kucinich concluded.<!-- #EndEditable -->
