<p> JUNE 29 - As Live Earth calls on individuals, companies and government to take
urgent action on climate change, Ethical Consumer calls consumers to
boycott three climate change criminals lobbying against a greener future.

<P></P>Number 1 consumer boycott – <b>Esso Petrol
Exxon</b> – the company behind Esso petrol – is the only major oil company
to fund front groups that confuse science on global warming. Long the
target of climate campaigners, the company also refuses to invest in
clean, renewable energy. Exxon has donated millions of pounds to the
climate change denying EU think tank International Policy Network and
Centre for the New Europe since 1998.[1]
Hanna Backman, researcher at Ethical Consumer, says: “The best
alternative is to leave the car at home, but failing that, of the major
oil companies BP (3.5) invests the most in renewable energy, and Murco
(9.5) comes out best in our Ethiscore ethical ratings – so refuel there
instead.”

<P></P>
Number 2 consumer boycott – <b>Kenco coffee</b> - Another company delaying attempts to tackle climate change by funding
groups which claim that global warming is either a "myth" or not worth
tackling, is Altria (previously knows as Philip Morris).[2]
Other brands owned by the Altria group: Philadelphia, Terry’s, Toblerone.
According to Hanna Backman: “There are so many alternative brands of
coffee out there – many of them fair trade – for consumers to choose
from. Cafédirect Fairtrade and organic coffee (16), Clipper Fairtrade
and organic coffee (14.5) and Traidcraft Fairtrade coffee (14.5) get the
best Ethiscore ratings.”

<P></P>Number 3 consumer boycott – <b>Nouvelle</b> recycled toilet tissue
Consumers might be surprised to see a recycled toilet tissue brand in
the list, but its parent, Georgia-Pacific, came out worst in a WWF
report on sustainability in the tissue sector.[3] Georgia-Pacific’s own
parent company, Koch Industries has been part of a team advising Bush on
developing a conservative “environmentalism for the 21st century”. This
“environmentalism” favoured deregulation and led to statements by Bush
that logging was good for forests and that dams were good for salmon.[4]
Other brands owned by the Koch Industries group: Lotus Professional and
JustOne (napkins).
<P></P>Hanna Backman says: “There are loads of alternatives to buying Nouvelle.
The most ethical of the widely available brands are Naturelle (9) or the
Co-op supermarket’s (5.5) recycled ranges. Ethical Consumer’s other Best
Buys, available at health food stores and online are the Natural
Collection (14.5), Traidcraft (14.5), Ecotopia (14),  Essential (14) and
Suma (14) recycled brands.”

<P></P>“There’s more to responsible consumption than just watching your own
impact. It’s also worth telling climate change deniers that you won’t
give them your money”, says Hanna Backman. “Consumers can email
companies through the Climate Criminals campaign page on the Ethiscore
website.” (<a href="http://www.ethiscore.org/info.aspx?info=campaign_climate" target="_new">http://www.ethiscore.org/info.aspx?info=campaign_climate</a>)
