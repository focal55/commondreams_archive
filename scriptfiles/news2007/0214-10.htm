<p>WASHINGTON - February 14 - <p>BRENDA EKWURZEL, via Aaron Huertas, ahuertas@ucsusa.org, 
<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org">http://www.ucsusa.org</a><p>    Ekwurzel is a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned 
Scientists, which recently released a report titled "Smoke, Mirrors and 
Hot Air: How ExxonMobil Uses Big Tobacco's Tactics to 'Manufacture 
Uncertainty' on Climate Change." The report states: "ExxonMobil has 
funneled nearly $16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 
advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming 
science."

<p>TOM JACKSON, joepublicfilms@yahoo.com, <a href="http://www.worldoutofbalance.org">http://www.worldoutofbalance.org</a><br>

    Jackson is the director-writer of the new documentary film "Out of 
Balance: ExxonMobil's Impact on Climate Change". He said today: "While 
reporting another record year of earnings, ExxonMobil has also recently 
started its own media blitz, attempting to convince the public that they 
have changed their ways with regard to climate change. In the past few 
weeks, through mainstream media outlets like MSNBC, ExxonMobil has 
implied that they aren't funding climate change skeptics anymore, but 
they actually only specify the Competitive Enterprise Institute -- 
they've funded many more organizations than that.
<p>   "Barely a week later, it was revealed that ExxonMobil attempted to 
pay off climate scientists to downplay the latest report from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Clearly ExxonMobil is only 
out to change its image, not its ways."

<p><b>Background:
</b>
<p>The British newspaper The Guardian recently reported: "Scientists and 
economists have been offered $10,000 each by a lobby group funded by one 
of the world's largest oil companies to undermine a major climate change 
report due to be published today.
<p> "Letters sent by the American Enterprise Institute, an 
ExxonMobil-funded thinktank with close links to the Bush administration, 
offered the payments for articles that emphasize the shortcomings of a 
report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ...
<p> "The AEI has received more than $1.6 million from ExxonMobil and 
more than 20 of its staff have worked as consultants to the Bush 
administration. Lee Raymond, a former head of ExxonMobil, is the 
vice-chairman of AEI's board of trustees."
