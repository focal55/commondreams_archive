<p>WASHINGTON - September 19 - The Constitution Project welcomed today's action by a majority of the United States Senate to force a vote on the restoration of the habeas corpus rights eliminated by the Military Commissions Act.  By a vote of 56-43, a majority of Senators supported a procedural motion that would end debate on an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill that would have restored the eliminated habeas rights.  Ending debate on S.AMDT. 2022, introduced by Senators Specter (R-PA), Leahy (D-VT), and Dodd (D-CT), would have allowed a majority of the Senate to vote on the amendment.

"While it is disappointing that some members of the Senate are unwilling to own up to a terrible legislative mistake, we are encouraged that a solid majority of the Senate is eager to restore this Constitutional right," said Virginia Sloan, president of the Constitution Project.  "The bipartisan effort to restore habeas corpus is a remarkable demonstration that the Constitution should and can be held above Washington's partisan fray."
