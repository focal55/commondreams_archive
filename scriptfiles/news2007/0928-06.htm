<p>  WASHINGTON, DC - September 28 –Green Party leaders participating in the week-long Encampment to End the War in Washington, DC and other cities across the US pressed their demands for an immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, with a plea to Congress to cancel further war spending.
<P></P>
The events, which will culminate in a march and rally on Saturday, September 29, have been organized by the Troops Out Now Coalition , of which the Green Party is a member.
<P></P>
On Friday, video interviews with Greens at the DC encampment will posted on line at the blog page  of the Green Party's Peace Action Committee (GPAX).
<P></P>
Summary of Green positions on the war:
<P></P>
• The Green Party of the United States has called for full and immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, the occupation of which is entering its sixth year; the party opposes a US military attack on Iran and warns Americans not to believe the new flood of deceptive war propaganda.
<P></P>
• Greens stress that Congress could end the war quickly if Democrats refused to move on bills for war funding, including the latest request for nearly $190 billion the Pentagon says is necessary to keep combat troops in Iraq for another year.  Greens urge Congress to divert federal funds from war spending to human needs and services in the US, including restoration and rebuilding in the Gulf Coast.
<P></P>
• The Green Party has called for the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney for numerous abuses of power, including misleading the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq.  Greens have called the invasion a criminal breach of the US Constitution and international law, motivated by desire for political and corporate dominance in the region, control over Iraqi oil and other resources, and cooperation with Israel's aggressive strategic objectives.
<P></P>
• Greens have sharply criticized Democratic leaders for supporting the invasion, offering vague and delayed timetables for troop withdrawal, approving bills for continued war spending, and retreating from impeachment.  Green leaders strongly condemned recent statements by presidential aspirants Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards that they could not promise the removal of all US combat troops from Iraq by 2013 , warning that the Iraq War (as well as the threat of war with Iran) will continue whether a Democrat or Republican is elected in 2008.
<P></P>
