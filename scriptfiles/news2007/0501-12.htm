<p> MARYLAND - May 1 – Peace Action, the country’s largest peace organization, today denounced President Bush’s veto of the supplemental appropriations bill for the war in Iraq. 

<P></P>Peace Action affiliates in New Jersey (Trenton, Montclair and Maplewood), Rochester, New York, Concord, New Hampshire, Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, Boston, Milwaukee and San Mateo, California and other cities are working with colleague anti-war groups on protest rallies within the next 24 –48 hours. 

<P></P>"Baghdad suffers a Virginia Tech massacre or worse every day, and Bush stubbornly asks for more time for his ‘surge’ to work – it’s madness. He seems intent on an endless war, and Congress and the American people cannot let him continue to pour our tax dollars into and consign Iraqis and US troops to die in his never-ending quagmire," said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action.

<P></P>Congress should respond to Bush’s veto not with an attempt to override his veto – they lack the votes and the bill is far too weak in the first place, as its loopholes could leave tens of thousands of US troops in Iraq indefinitely. Congress should instead send Bush a bill to fund the safe and orderly withdrawal of all US troops, contractors and bases within six months, as advocated by congressional anti-war leaders, while also funding an interim peacekeeping force if Iraqis want it, a down payment on reparations and reconstruction for Iraq, and a dramatic increase in health care and services for our homecoming troops. 

<P></P>"The voters delivered a resounding mandate for peace at the polls last November, but Bush appears oblivious to that, and to the havoc he is causing to US and global security by stubbornly ‘staying the course.’ Perhaps the threat of impeachment over his deception in starting this war, as several Members of Congress have raised recently, is the only thing that will move him," added Martin.

<P></P>Peace Action is the country’s largest peace and disarmament organization with over 100,000 members nationwide, with affiliates organizing in over 30 states. Peace Action marks its 50th anniversary this year – the organization was founded as the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE) in 1957.
