<p>  AUSTIN - September 26– Texas’ renewable electricity standard (RES) is
cutting pollution, saving money, creating jobs, and fueling a clean energy boom
in Texas, as in the other 24 U.S. states that have passed similar policies,
according to a new report released today by Environment Texas. Environment Texas also called on
Congress to establish a national RES. </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">America
now generates twice as much electricity from the wind and the sun as it did
just four years ago. RES policies have been among the most important factors in
encouraging the development of renewable energy. The new report, <a href="http://environmenttexas.org/reports/energy/energy-program-reports/reaping-the-rewards" target="_new" title="Reaping the Rewards">Reaping the Rewards</a>, documents the
benefits that have already been achieved by states that have adopted renewable
electricity standards.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">“Texans are already reaping the rewards for Texas’ leadership on
clean energy,” said Luke Metzger, Director of Environment Texas. “Thanks to the
renewable electricity standard, clean energy is booming in Texas,” continued Metzger.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Reaping the Rewards found that RES states are leading the way in renewable energy development. </p>



<ul><li>In
     2006, more than two-thirds of all new renewable electric generating
     capacity in the United
       States was built in RES states.</li></ul>



<ul><li>For
     the past two years, Texas
     has led the nation in wind energy with more than 3000 megawatts installed,
     the bulk of which has come since the passage of the RES in 1999.</li></ul>



<ul><li>In 2007, renewables account for about 38 percent of planned
capacity additions in RES states, compared to just 12 percent in
non-RES states. According to the Public Utility Commission of Texas,
there are “expressions of interest in constructing 24,511 MW” of wind
generation in the coming years. </li></ul>



<ul><li>Texas
     boasts the world’s largest and second largest wind farms, FPL Energy’s 735
     MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center and the 505 MW Sweetwater project owned
     by Babcock &amp; Brown &amp; Catamount Energy, both located near Abilene.</li></ul>


<p class="MsoNormal">The report also found significant environmental benefits as
a result of new renewable energy development. Renewable energy sources that have
been built since the adoption of state RES policies will<br></p>



<ul><li><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]-->reduce America’s
global warming emissions by approximately 8.4 million metric tons per year, the
equivalent of taking more than 1.5 million cars off America’s roads.</li></ul>

<ul><li><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]-->avert approximately 2,100 tons of nitrogen oxide
emissions, 44 tons of sulfur dioxide emissions, and 220 tons of non-methane
hydrocarbon emissions each year.</li></ul>

<ul><li>save approximately 1.2 billion gallons of water
per year.</li></ul>




<p class="MsoNormal">RES policies play an important role in attracting
manufacturing facilities by making a long-term commitment to building the
market for renewable energy technologies.<br>For
example, in November 2006, TECO/Westinghouse announced a partnership in which
the company will manufacture technology for wind turbines at its Round Rock facility,
adding approximately 100 jobs. MEMC Pasadena near Houston "is now a major world supplier of solar-grade polysilicon." </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Renewable
energy can also play an important role in accelerating rural economic
development. The American Wind Energy Association estimates that royalty
payments to Texas
landowners exceed $9.5 million per year, while boosting local property tax
revenues.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Renewable
energy is also saving consumers money. According to the Wind Coalition, by
displacing use of high-cost natural gas, wind power saved $476 million in
wholesale power costs in Texas
last year.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“State officials
across the nation deserve tremendous credit for recognizing the benefits of
jumpstarting renewable energy and taking action,” said Metzger. </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">In order to expand the benefits of renewable energy
development, the report concludes that the United
 States should adopt a renewable electricity standard
requiring at least 25 percent of America’s electricity to come from
new renewable sources by 2025.&nbsp; This
summer, the House passed a national RES that would establish a 15 percent
requirement. The Senate also passed energy legislation this summer, but did not
include an RES. The Senate can accept the House RES when the two bills are
negotiated in conference this fall.</p>



<p>“After a decade of leadership in the states, it is time for
Congress to follow,” said Metzger. “The House has taken an important step in
the right direction by passing the RES, and the Senate should join them. In
addition to strong fuel economy improvements and energy efficiency provisions,
no energy bill will be complete without a national renewable electricity
standard,” continued Metzger.<br>
