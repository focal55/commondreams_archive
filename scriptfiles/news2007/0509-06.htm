<p>NEW YORK - May 9 - The 
American Civil Liberties Union today announced a multi-state action calling on 
the federal government to fix medical inaccuracies in federally funded 
abstinence-only-until-marriage curricula.&nbsp; Eleven ACLU affiliates sent 
letters to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) alerting the agency 
to problematic curricula in their states and asking HHS to take steps to remedy 
the situation.
<p>“We are taking action today because federally funded 
abstinence-only-until-marriage curricula across the country contain medically 
inaccurate information about the importance of condoms in preventing pregnancy 
and the spread of sexually transmitted disease,” said Julie Sternberg, Senior 
Staff Attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom.&nbsp; “Spreading 
misinformation about condoms in many abstinence-only-until-marriage programs 
violates federal law and endangers teens’ health.”</p>

<p>Today’s action comes on the heels of an April <a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/sexed/29488prs20070426.html">letter</a> the ACLU sent to HHS, 
which said three&nbsp; federally funded abstinence-only-until-marriage 
curricula, <em>Me, My World, My Future; Sexuality, Commitment &amp; Family</em>; and <em>Why 
kNOw</em>, along with HHS’s own 4parents.gov Web site and pamphlet, <em>Parents, Speak 
Up!</em>, all violate a federal law requiring certain educational materials to 
contain medically accurate information about condom effectiveness.&nbsp; In that 
letter, the ACLU called on HHS to immediately remedy the violations or face a 
legal challenge.</p>

<p>“The government has turned a blind eye to the misinformation in federally 
funded abstinence-only-until-marriage programs,” said Sternberg. “It is time for 
the federal government to start properly monitoring the content of these 
programs.” </p>
<p>The ACLU affiliates participating in today’s action include: Alaska Civil 
Liberties Union, ACLU of Arizona, ACLU of Florida, ACLU of Illinois, ACLU of 
Kansas and Western Missouri, ACLU of Kentucky, ACLU of Louisiana, ACLU of New 
Jersey, Rhode Island ACLU, ACLU of Tennessee, and ACLU of Texas.</p>
<p><a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/sexed/29488prs20070426.html">Last week</a>, the ACLU asked HHS and the Oregon Department of Human Services to 
investigate evidence of misuse of taxpayer dollars to promote one faith over 
others in an abstinence-only-until-marriage program Stop and Think.&nbsp; The 
ACLU threatened to pursue legal action if sufficient measures are not taken to 
correct any problems.</p>
<p>In early April, <a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/sexed/29358prs20070413.html">a federally commissioned study</a> was released showing that, 
notwithstanding the more than a billion dollars that the federal government has 
poured into the programs since 1996, abstinence-only-until-marriage programs 
don’t work.&nbsp; The study looked at several federally funded programs and 
found that teens who participated in them were just as likely to have sex as 
teens who did not participate.&nbsp; Furthermore, these students had first 
intercourse at the same age, and the same number of sexual partners, as students 
who did not participate.</p>

<p>Currently, no federal funds are dedicated to supporting sexuality education 
programs that both teach abstinence and include complete and medically accurate 
information about how to use contraceptives effectively, despite evidence that 
these programs can delay sexual activity and increase contraceptive use among 
teens.&nbsp; </p>
