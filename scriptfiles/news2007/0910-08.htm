WASHINGTON - September 10 -    Jackson identifies broadband access as important civil rights issue in
America.<br>
<p></p>Rainbow PUSH Coalition
(RPC) founder and President Rev. Jesse Jackson, in a September 7 letter to
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Kevin Martin, endorsed M2Z
Networks' (M2Z) plan to provide free and family-friendly broadband Internet
access across the country. Rev. Jackson urged the FCC to work quickly to
make this a reality for all Americans.
<p></p>
    "The RPC supports M2Z Networks, Inc.'s (M2Z) plan to level the playing
field for broadband access in the United States and to help connect
millions of underserved Americans," wrote Jackson in the letter, adding
"Moreover, we believe that the FCC has a moral obligation to promote
justice and equality by extending the critical opportunities of the
information age to all Americans."
<p></p>
    "For more than 16 months since we first proposed our plan to the FCC,
M2Z has been ready to provide a free and family-friendly broadband Internet
service across the country," said M2Z Networks' co-founder and CEO John
Muleta. Muleta added, "We've consistently urged swift action to put fallow
spectrum to use so that all Americans, not just some Americans, can enjoy
the right to full participation in the digital age and fulfillment of the
American Dream. This is the FCC's statutory obligation to the American
people."
<p></p>
    Section I of the Communications Act requires the FCC to act to make
communications services available to the public at reasonable charges
"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national
origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, nationwide, and world-wide wire and
radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable
charges." Is this vein, Rev. Jackson wrote "It is critical the FCC make it
a priority to establish a free nationwide broadband network as the benefits
of broadband cannot be reserved only for those members of our society with
sufficient disposable income to afford a monthly high-speed connection."
<p></p>
    RPC is a combination of a grassroots and a political organization
merged together in 1997, which seeks to protect, defend and gain civil
rights and to even the economic and educational playing fields in all
aspects of American life and to bring peace to the world. Rev. Jesse L.
Jackson Sr. is the founder and President of RPC.
<p></p>
    Rev. Jackson and RPC join thousands of national organizations, local
and state officials, Members of Congress, and American citizens already in
support of M2Z's plan to bring free and family-friendly broadband Internet
to all Americans. Supporters include: ACORN, the National PTA, the Minority
Media and Telecommunications Council and the One Economy Corporation. To

<i>About M2Z Networks:
</i>
<p></p>
    <i>Founded in 2005 and headquartered in Menlo Park, Calif., M2Z Networks'
goal is to transform the current state of the broadband marketplace by
building a high-speed wireless network throughout the United States. In May
2006, the company submitted a license application to the FCC to construct
and operate a nationwide broadband wireless network in the 2155-2175 MHz
spectrum band. Approval of the initiative, to which the FCC recently has
indicated it would extend consideration in a forthcoming rulemaking, would
guarantee delivery of free, fast and family-friendly wireless broadband
service to at least 95 percent of Americans in a 10 year timeframe. The
service will be supported by locally targeted search results and will
include a network-level filter to shield children using the service from
indecent content. If licensed, M2Z would pay the U.S. Treasury 5 percent of
annual gross revenues from its premium subscription services, which could
total payments of up to $1 billion over 15 years. The introduction of M2Z's
broadband service would generate $18 to $32 billion in direct consumer
benefits over the next 15 years according to two uncontested economic
studies. M2Z is backed by Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers; Charles
River Ventures; and Redpoint Ventures; three of the most successful venture
capital firms in Silicon Valley with $5 billon of capital under management.
