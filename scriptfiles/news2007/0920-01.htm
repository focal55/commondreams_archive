<p>RESTON, VA - September 20 - The American Medical Student Association (<a href="http://www.AMSA.org" target="_new">AMSA</a>), the nation’s largest, independent medical student organization, representing more than 68,000 physicians-in-training, today urges the U.S. House of Representatives to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (H.R. 2015), in order to protect every American from discriminatory employment practices based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
<p></p>
 

AMSA recognizes that the lack of an inclusive federal non-discrimination policy leaves many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Americans vulnerable to workplace discrimination that exacerbates health disparities experienced by LGBT communities.  The legislation would make it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, or refuse to promote employees based on a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Employment decisions should be based upon a person’s qualifications and job performance.
<p></p>
 

“It is currently legal to base employment decisions solely on a persons’ perceived or actual sexual orientation in 31 states and based on gender identity in 39 states,” says Andrea Knittel, AMSA’s chair for LGBT health. “The healthcare community should be concerned as discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is a major stressor to members of the LGBT community and has major implications on their mental and physical health.”
<p></p>
 

“AMSA believes in eliminating health disparities for all people, including the LGBT community,” states AMSA National President Dr. Michael Ehlert. “The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is a step in the right direction toward protecting the right to fair and equal treatment for all Americans.”
