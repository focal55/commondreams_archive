<p>Washington, DC —An Environmental Working Group (EWG) analysis of
recently published data from scientists at the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) and Boston University (BU) shows that infants are being
exposed to dangerous levels of the rocket fuel component perchlorate.</p> <p>The
CDC/BU study, which examined breast milk from 49 Boston area women,
found that the average breast fed infant in this study is being exposed
to more than double the dose of perchlorate that the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) considers safe; highly exposed babies are
ingesting up to 10 times this amount. Today, EWG called on the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take action and implement
adequate nationwide standards for perchlorate.</p>

<p>"The levels of perchlorate found in breast milk in this study
suggest a serious threat to the normal development and health of
potentially all American infants. To protect public health, EPA must
adopt a maximum contaminant level for perchlorate in drinking water
based on the most recent science, including the 2006 CDC study and the
Boston study," wrote Dr. Anila Jacob, MD, MPH and Richard Wiles,
Executive Director of EWG in their letter to EPA Administrator Stephen
Johnson.</p>

<p>Perchlorate, the explosive ingredient in solid rocket fuel, has
leaked from military bases and defense and aerospace contractors'
plants in at least 22 states, contaminating drinking water for millions
of Americans. The chemical has also been found to contaminate dairy
milk, produce, and many other foods and plants. In a related 2006
study, the CDC found perchlorate in the urine of every one of 2,820
people tested, suggesting that food is a key route of exposure in
addition to drinking water. Boston's tap water is not known to be
contaminated with perchlorate; the 49 women in this study were likely
exposed through food.</p>

<p>Breast milk is by far the healthiest food for infants, and mothers
should continue to breastfeed their babies. However, the perchlorate
levels found in breast milk in this CDC/BU study are alarming.</p>  <p><i>EWG is a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, DC
that uses the power of information to protect human health and the
environment. The group's research on this issue as well as the CDC/BU
report and the letter to EPA are available online at <a href="http://ewg.org/issues/perchlorate/20070329/" target="_new">http://ewg.org/issues/perchlorate/20070329/</a>.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
