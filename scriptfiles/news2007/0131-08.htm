<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - At a federal appeals court hearing today, the American Civil 
Liberties Union will argue that the president broke the law by authorizing the 
National Security Agency to engage in warrantless surveillance of Americans. The 
ACLU is urging the appeals court to uphold a lower court order that would 
prevent the NSA from resuming the illegal program. </P>
<P>"Unchecked government 
spying has no place in a democratic society," said Ann Beeson, Associate Legal 
Director of the ACLU and lead attorney in the case. "Under our Constitution, the 
president does not have the authority to ignore laws he does not like, whenever 
he wants. We are asking the court to exercise its duty to protect Americans from 
arbitrary executive power."</P>
<P>A district court judge ruled on August 17, 2006 
that the NSA program violates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) 
and is unconstitutional. Stating that there are "no hereditary kings in America 
and no power not created by the Constitution," Judge Anna Diggs Taylor ordered 
the president to shut down the illegal program. The Bush administration appealed 
the ruling, and a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals heard 
the case today.</P>
<P>"The Bush administration has been relentless in its disregard 
of the Constitution and erosion of our basic freedoms," said Anthony D. Romero, 
Executive Director of the ACLU. "For five years, the NSA conducted illegal 
warrantless surveillance of Americans. It is now up to the courts and Congress 
to uphold the rule of law and restore our civil liberties."</P>
<P>In a sudden 
reversal of the government&#8217;s position that it could not comply with FISA without 
jeopardizing national security, on January 17, 2007 the Justice Department 
conceded that the judicial branch has a role in overseeing surveillance by the 
NSA, and announced that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued 
secret orders approving the surveillance. However, the Justice Department 
refused to confirm whether the orders are for specific warrants based on 
probable cause or if they generally authorize the surveillance program in broad 
terms. The ACLU said that a general warrant not based on individualized 
suspicion is unconstitutional and violates FISA.</P>
<P>The Bush administration 
filed a brief last week seeking to dismiss the ACLU lawsuit because the NSA 
surveillance is now under the review of the secret intelligence court. However, 
the ACLU noted that the president is still claiming the "inherent authority" to 
engage in warrantless eavesdropping and nothing would stop him from resuming 
warrantless surveillance tomorrow. Only an order from the court saying that the 
president cannot violate the law would prevent that from happening, the ACLU 
argued.</P>
<P>"Given the very real risk that the president will engage in intrusive 
and unchecked surveillance again - the very risk that threatened our democracy 
in the past and that Congress intended to eliminate by passing FISA - this court 
should exercise its important duty to ensure that the executive branch follows 
the law," said the ACLU in a brief filed with the court last week.</P>
<P>The ACLU 
has asked the appeals court to unseal secret documents filed by the Bush 
administration in this case, which likely pertain to the new FISA court orders. 
The ACLU argued that the documents were improperly classified. Senator Arlen 
Specter (R-PA), the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, echoed 
the ACLU&#8217;s concerns in a letter sent last Friday to Attorney General Alberto 
Gonzales. Senator Specter said that "the Department of Justice may have a 
conflict of interest in limiting access to key evidence on national security 
grounds as a means of controlling the outcome of these cases and obstructing the 
federal courts in their adjudications." </P>
<P>The case is <EM>ACLU v. National 
Security Agency</EM>, Docket No. 06-2095. More information, including legal briefs 
and plaintiff statements, is online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/nsaspying">www.aclu.org/nsaspying</A></P>
<P>Attorneys in 
the case are Beeson, Jameel Jaffer and Melissa Goodman of the national ACLU; 
Michael Steinberg and Kary Moss of the ACLU of Michigan; and Randy Gainer of 
Seattle law firm Davis Wright Tremaine. The lawsuit names as defendants the NSA 
and Lieutenant General Keith B. Alexander, Director of the 
NSA.
