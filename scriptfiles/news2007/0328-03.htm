Washington -- While Americans
continue to debate the U.S. position in Iraq, four years after the invasion
in March 2003, Arab countries remain deeply concerned and fearful of the
long-term regional damage caused by the conflict. This is according to a
Zogby International (ZI)/Arab American Institute (AAI) poll of five Arab
countries released today.
<p>Among the findings were statistics that indicated a number of countries
polled now view the U.S. role in Iraq as being more negative than Iran's
influence in Iraq.
<p>Of particular concern to Arabs polled in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan,
United Arab Emirates and Lebanon is the degree to which the war has
emboldened neighboring Iran and the heightened danger that Iraq may unravel
in a civil war that could spill over into the broader region.
<p>While it's not surprising that Arabs polled responded negatively
regarding the U.S.'s role in Iraq -- ranging from 68% in Saudi Arabia to
96% in Jordan - - their opinions were also very negative regarding Iran's
perceived role. In Saudi Arabia, for instance, more respondents expressed
negative attitudes towards Iran (78%) than towards the U.S. [See Chart 1.]
<p>"The Bush Administration finds itself in a bind of its own making,
created by entering into this conflict without a clear understanding of its
consequences," said Dr. James Zogby, president of AAI. "But this same bind
has also placed our Arab allies in an equally difficult situation -- one
with even more troubling options."
<p>The poll, which was conducted between Feb. 26 and March 10, 2007,
surveyed 3,400 Arabs in five countries. The margin of error of in Egypt and
Saudi Arabia was +/-3.5% and in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and
Lebanon it was +/- 4.1%.
