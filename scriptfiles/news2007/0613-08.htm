<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 13 - The&nbsp;Senate Committee committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs today approved the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act. While the legislation&nbsp;would strengthen protections for federal whistleblowers who expose waste, fraud and abuse of power, it&nbsp;fails to address scientists who expose the manipulation, distortion, or suppression of their work, according the Union of Concerned Scientists. </p>
<p>A bipartisan House bill, approved overwhelmingly in March, includes strong protections for federal scientists and contractors, giving them the right to expose political interference in their research without fear of reprisals. The bill passed by a 331 to 94 vote, with 229 Democrats and 102 Republicans voting in favor. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs approved the Senate legislation (the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act).</p>
<p>Political interference in science has become a pervasive problem in the federal government. Recent surveys have documented that hundreds of scientists across nine federal agencies fear reprisals when they openly discuss concerns about their agency's work. </p>
<p>The following is a statement by Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists: </p>

<p>"While the Senate bill is a good first step to extending meaningful protections to federal employees who sound the alarm on government waste, fraud and abuse, it does not yet contain language that would ensure that federal scientists are free to do their work without fear of political interference. We have heard from hundreds of federal scientists who fear retaliation for raising concerns about their agency's mission-driven work. </p>
<p>"The Senate must incorporate equally strong protections for federal scientists in any whistleblower legislation. The Senate should recognize, as the House does, that scientists must be able to work to protect the health and safety of Americans without fear of retribution."</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
