<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 26 -The incoming board and staff of Beyond Nuclear are extremely pleased to announce that Beyond Nuclear will now pursue its mission under the auspices of the Nuclear Policy Research Institute (NPRI).<P></P>NPRI was established by Dr. Helen Caldicott, a renowned physician who has devoted the last 35 years to an international campaign to educate the public about the hazards of the nuclear age and the necessary changes in human behavior to stop environmental destruction. NPRI is a tax-exempt and tax-deductible organization.<P></P>Beyond Nuclear is a new initiative that aims to educate wider audiences about the connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons and the need to abandon both to safeguard our future. Beyond Nuclear works to promote positive, solutions-focused messages and to provide guides to safer alternatives to these dangerous technologies. Beyond Nuclear was previously undertaken through Nuclear Information and Resource Service.<P></P>Beyond Nuclear and NPRI share a synergistic vision: to communicate the grave threats to health, environment and safety implicit in the complexities of the nuclear industry. To that end, Beyond Nuclear will focus its work on the public and the media using dynamic campaigns and its cadre of expert spokespeople to create a consistent high-profile presence for these issues. It will also serve as a resource with which to build and expand the movement for a world beyond nuclear.<P></P>Our staff – Paul Gunter, Kevin Kamps, Cindy Folkers and Linda Gunter – has comprehensive expertise in all aspects of nuclear power. In addition, Beyond Nuclear will partner with national and international <script><!--
