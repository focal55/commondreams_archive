<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 26 - Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety (CCNS) invites the public to produce a video that shows a nuclear free future as an alternative to the future currently being proposed by the Department of Energy (DOE).

           <P></P>DOE has developed a proposal called Complex 2030, which outlines an expanded future of the United States nuclear weapons arsenal by the year 2030.  DOE aims to modernize the nuclear weapons complex in order to produce an evolving line of new nuclear weapons and ensure that they have a continued role in the United States defense strategy for years to come.

             <P></P>Sadaf Cameron, Public Education and Outreach Director of CCNS said, “The year 2030 belongs to us.  It’s time to open the imagination and be creative in counteracting proposals such as Complex 2030.  This video project opens new avenues for the public to participate in ways that do just that.”

             <P></P>CCNS invites the public to participate in opposing the DOE 2030 proposal by creating videos depicting the world as they would like to see it in the year 2030.  This video should be placed on the YouTube Vision 2030 Group site at http://youtube.com/group/vision2030.  The Youtube Group is a place where people can find CCNS’s short film inviting the public to participate in this project, post videos and view videos posted by others participating in the project.

             <P></P>CCNS will compile the videos, which are posted to the Vision 2030 Youtube Group, and submit them to DOE, as well as elected decisionmakers.  DOE has agreed to accept these videos as public comment for the administrative record.

             <P></P>Currently, some aspects of the Complex 2030 proposal are threatened by congressional budget cuts.  Such cuts would potentially stall the Complex 2030 proposal.  However, many of the activities suggested in the Complex 2030 proposal are already occurring or will occur in the near future under other names.  Therefore, it is imperative to continue opposing the project by all means necessary.
