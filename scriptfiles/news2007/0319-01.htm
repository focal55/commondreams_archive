<p>WASHINGTON - March 19 - JARED BERNSTEIN, <a href="mailto:jbernstein@epinet.org">jbernstein@epinet.org</a>, <a href="http://www.epinet.org">http://epinet.org</a>
<p>    Bernstein is senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute. In 
his most recent piece, "There's Always Money For War," he writes: "Okay, 
this is going to sound really naïve. It's the kind of question you’d 
expect from an earnest, if not slightly annoying, 12-year-old, not from 
a hard-boiled wonk like yours truly. <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2007/03/12/theres_always_money_for_war.php" target="_new">But why is it that our 
representatives can easily raise endless amounts of money for war, but 
can't adequately fund human needs?"</a> 
<p>    Bernstein is author of the book "All Together Now: Common Sense for 
a Fair Economy."

<p>FRANCES FOX PIVEN,<a href="mailto:fpiven@email.gc.cuny.edu"> fpiven@email.gc.cuny.edu</a> , 
<a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Bush_Gang/War_At_Home.html" target="_new">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Bush_Gang/War_At_Home.html</a>
<p>   Piven's most recent books are "The War at Home: The Domestic Costs 
of Bush's Militarism" and "Challenging Authority: How Ordinary People 
Change America." She said today: "The supplemental spending bill ... is 
an attempt to straddle continuing divisions, by combining nearly $100 
billion in new war spending with a timetable for troop withdrawal, and 
some supplemental domestic spending. Of course, even if it passes, the 
bill may well turn out to be largely symbolic, since it faces both the 
Senate and the prospect of a presidential veto.
<p>  "Nevertheless, the bill crafted by the Democratic House majority is 
cautious because the leaders are trying to protect their flanks from the 
unknown consequences of withdrawal as the next election approaches. They 
are, after all, politicians. But ... the antiwar movement is gaining 
momentum, encouraged by the fact that the new Democratic Congress can't 
ignore them as the old one did. That the movement matters is evident in 
the fact that the House bill faces not only unified Republican 
opposition, but the prospect of at least 15 defections from Democrats 
bridling at the compromise the bill represents."
<p>   Piven is Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Sociology 
at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of 
New York. Her past books include "The Breaking of the American Social 
Compact."
