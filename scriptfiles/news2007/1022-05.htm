<p>WASHINGTON - October 22 - The American Civil Liberties Union and Columbia 
University Press today announce the publication of <i>Administration of Torture: 
A Documentary Record from Washington to Abu Ghraib and Beyond</i>. Written by 
ACLU attorneys Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh, the book presents a detailed 
account of the treatment of prisoners held in 
U.S. detention 
centers in 
Afghanistan, 
Iraq, and 
Guantánamo 
Bay. Based on thousands of government 
documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the book supplies 
substantial evidence that the torture and abuse of prisoners was systemic and 
resulted from decisions made by senior 
U.S. officials, 
both military and civilian. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The 
book builds on work that the ACLU and its partners have been doing in recent 
years. In October 2003, the ACLU—along with the Center for Constitutional 
Rights, Physicians for Human Rights, Veterans for Common Sense, and Veterans for 
Peace—filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for records 
concerning the treatment of prisoners in 
U.S. custody 
abroad. While the government continues to withhold key records, litigation 
(which is ongoing) has resulted in the release of thousands of government 
documents totaling more than 100,000 pages. <i>Administration of Torture</i> 
collects and presents some of the most significant of these documents. In an 
extended essay that relies almost entirely on the documents, Jaffer and Singh 
draw the connection between the policies adopted by senior officials and the 
abuse that took place on the ground.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><i>Administration of 
Torture</i> exposes the stark contradictions between the Bush administration’s 
public disavowals of torture and the facts established by the administration’s 
own documents. Jaffer and Singh write, “The fact that the Abu Ghraib photographs 
depicted abuse at a single prison allowed senior administration officials to 
claim, as they did repeatedly, that the abuse was confined to that facility. 
This claim was completely false, and senior officials almost certainly knew it 
to be so.” They note that government documents show that prisoners were beaten, 
kicked, and abused at other detention facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq; that 
autopsy reports record numerous deaths in U.S. custody as homicides caused by 
strangulation, suffocation, or blunt-force injuries; and that documents from 
Guantánamo describe prisoners shackled in excruciating “stress positions,” held 
in freezing-cold cells, forcibly stripped, hooded, terrorized with military 
dogs, and deprived of human contact for months. The authors also show – using 
the government’s own documents – that officials were aware of the scope of the 
abuse problem well before the Abu Ghraib photographs were broadcast to the 
public.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><i>Administration of 
Torture</i> also contends that the abuse of prisoners took place because of 
policy, not in spite of it. Jaffer and Singh write, “the maltreatment of 
prisoners resulted in large part from decisions made by senior officials, both 
military and civilian. These decisions&nbsp;…were reaffirmed repeatedly, even in 
the fact of complaints from law enforcement and military personnel that the 
policies were illegal and ineffective, and even after countless prisoners …were 
abused, tortured, or killed in custody.” They continue, “The documents show that 
senior officials endorsed the abuse of prisoners as a matter of policy – 
sometimes by tolerating it, sometimes by encouraging it, and sometimes by 
expressly authorizing it.”</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The 
documents presented in <i>Administration of Torture</i> include many details 
that warrant public attention and further inquiry. Documents presented in the 
book show, for example, </p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that Gen. Michael Dunlavey, who asked the Pentagon to 
approve more aggressive interrogation methods for use at Guantánamo, claims to 
have received “marching orders” from President Bush;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that according to an Army investigator, Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld was "personally involved" in overseeing the interrogation of 
Mohammed al Qahtani, a Guantánamo prisoner who was stripped naked, paraded in 
front of female interrogators, made to wear women’s underwear on his head, led 
around on a leash, and forced to perform dog tricks. According to the 
investigator, while Rumsfeld did not himself authorize those specific methods, 
he failed to place a "throttle" over abusive "applications" of the "broad 
techniques" that he did authorize;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that interrogators who used abusive “SERE” (Survival, 
Evasion, Resistance, Escape) methods at Guantánamo did so because the Pentagon 
had endorsed those methods and required interrogators to be trained in the use 
of those methods;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that FBI personnel who complained of abuse at Guantánamo 
were complaining of abuse that had been authorized by the Defense Department 
chain of command;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that some of the Abu Ghraib photos showed prisoners being 
subjected to the very same interrogation methods that Rumsfeld had endorsed for 
use at Guantánamo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that the plan of Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller to "Gitmoize" 
Abu Ghraib was endorsed by senior Defense Department officials;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that though the President and other senior officials 
insisted that abuse was limited to Abu Ghraib, a Defense Department "Information 
Paper" shows that, three weeks before the Abu Ghraib photos were leaked to the 
press, the Army was aware of at least 62 allegations of prisoner abuse in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, most of which did not relate to Abu Ghraib;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span>that the Defense Department held prisoners as young as 12 
years old;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

</span></span></span>that the Defense Department approved holding prisoners in 
cells as small as 3.1 x 4.0 x 1.5 feet, and that special forces held prisoners 
in cells only slightly larger than that.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Jaffer and Singh write, 
“It is imperative that senior officials who authorized, endorsed, or tolerated 
the abuse and torture of prisoners be held accountable, not only as a matter of 
elemental justice, but to ensure that the same crimes are not perpetrated 
again.”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

Torture</i> includes more than 350 pages from government documents concerning
