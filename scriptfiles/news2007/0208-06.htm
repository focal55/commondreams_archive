<p>WASHINGTON - February 8 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is raising questions 
          about the President&#8217;s proposed plan to jeopardize the Milk Income 
          Loss Contract (MILC) program during fiscal year 2007. Feingold, a member 
          of the Senate Budget Committee, questioned Office of Management and 
          Budget Director Rob Portman about the future of the MILC program since 
          its current extension expires one month shy of the end of the current 
          Farm Bill. Currently, the President&#8217;s budget does not fill this 
          gap, putting the program and dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the 
          upcoming Farm Bill. Moreover, the President&#8217;s Farm Bill proposal 
          would cut funding by 62% for MILC through FY2013 when the new Farm Bill 
          expires.
<p>&#8220;I am concerned that dairy farmers are being treated very unfairly, 
            both in Congress and in the administration,&#8221; Feingold said. 
            &#8220;Given the President&#8217;s support for extending the MILC 
            program, I had hoped he would have proposed to provide this full extension. 
            Wisconsin&#8217;s dairy farmers feel misled and let down, especially 
            amid press reports that the President&#8217;s proposals will provide 
            assistance to other industries.&#8221;</p>
          <p>The MILC program provides an important safety net for dairy farmers 
            when the price of milk falls to low levels. During a period of historically 
            low prices in 2002 and much of 2003, the program made the difference 
            between dairy farmers staying on the farm and going out of business. 
            During campaign visits to Wausau, WI and Cuba City, WI in 2004, the 
            President supported extending the program.</p>
          <p>Feingold is also continuing his &#8220;Rural Communities Week&#8221; 
            to address issues facing rural America with the reintroduction of 
            a series of bills. Feingold&#8217;s bills address inequities in the 
            Federal Milk Marketing System that hurt farmers in Wisconsin and the 
            Upper Midwest; protect consumers and provide support to America&#8217;s 
            dairy farmers by protecting the integrity of cheese; and prohibit 
            dairy marketing co-ops from denying individual dairy farmers the option 
            to cast their vote independently on dairy policy.</p>
          
        <p><strong>Federal Milk Marketing Order Distance Reform:<br>
          </strong>The Federal Milk Marketing Reform Act of 2007 would prohibit 
          the Secretary of Agriculture from using distance or transportation costs 
          from any location outside the region as the basis for pricing milk, 
          unless there is proof that a significant amount of milk is traded between 
          the regions. This bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress 
          on specifically which criteria are used to set milk prices, and the 
          Secretary will also have to certify to Congress that the criteria used 
          by the Department do not in any way attempt to circumvent the prohibition 
          on using distance or transportation cost as basis for pricing milk. 
          Under the current archaic law, the price farmers receive for milk increases 
          depends on the distance from the area around Eau Claire -- hurting Wisconsin 
          farmers.</p>
        <p><strong>The Quality Cheese Act:<br>
          </strong>The Quality Cheese Act, co-sponsored by Senator Charles Schumer 
          (D-NY), would prevent the Food and Drug Administration from making changes 
          to the official definition of &#8220;milk&#8221; used in natural cheese 
          products without thorough review and consideration of the impact on 
          U.S. dairy farmers. If the federal government creates a loophole for 
          imitation cheese ingredients such as milk protein concentrates to be 
          used in cheese vats, some cheese labels saying &#8220;domestic&#8221; 
          and &#8220;natural&#8221; will no longer be truly accurate. Feingold&#8217;s 
          legislation will prevent the FDA from allowing any standard cheese or 
          cheese products from including these ingredients and will ensure they 
          are made from truly natural ingredients.</p>
        <p><strong>Democracy for Dairy Producers:<br>
          </strong>Through &#8220;bloc voting,&#8221; dairy marketing cooperatives 
          cast votes on behalf of all cooperative members in the interest of saving 
          time, even though it means that individual farmers have no chance to 
          make their differing voices heard. The Democracy for Dairy Producers 
          Act provides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its members a ballot 
          if the individual farmers choose to vote differently than the cooperative&#8217;s 
          board of directors. Feingold&#8217;s bill requires cooperatives to provide 
          their members with important information to help them determine whether 
they wish to exercise their option to vote independently of the cooperative.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
