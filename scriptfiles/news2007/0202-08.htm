<p>LONDON - February 2 - "Poor people in many parts of the world are experiencing the effects of climate change now and their stories of floods, droughts and unpredictable weather show the real meaning of the global changes that scientists are observing and their predictions are bleak,”</STRONG> said Yasmin McDonnell, Emergencies Policy Adviser at ActionAid.</P>
<P>ActionAid has released a new report Unjust Waters documenting the experiences of flooding in poor communities in six African cities*. </P>
<P>The report identifies four different kinds of urban flooding, shows how floods are preventing poor people improving their quality of life, and recommends actions which will help poor people to protect themselves against floods.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The International Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report is expected to contain new, refined scenarios for climate change and rising sea levels and is regarded as the most important international report on the issue since 2001.</P>
<P>*Accra, Freetown, Kampala, Lagos, Maputo, Nairobi. A summary of the report was published in November 2006.</P>
