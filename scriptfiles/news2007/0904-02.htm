<p>NEW YORK - September 4 - The 
American Civil Liberties Union is filing a 
lawsuit today against the 
Department of Defense (DoD), demanding that it comply 
with a Freedom of 
Information Act request to release documents regarding 
civilians killed 
by coalition forces in 

Iraq 
and 

Afghanistan.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>"There can be no more 
important decision in a democracy than whether 
to go to war, yet this 
administration has gone to unprecedented lengths 
to control the information that 
the American people need to make 
informed judgments," said Ben Wizner, an 
attorney in ACLU's National 
Security Project. "The government’s refusal to 
comply with the ACLU’s 
FOIA request unlawfully obstructs the public’s right to 
know the true 
costs of our nation’s wars." </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The ACLU sought records 
from several components of DoD more than a 
year ago, but has received documents 
only from the Department of the 
Army. The Army has provided thousands of pages 
of documents chronicling 
civilian casualties in 

Iraq 
and 

Afghanistan.&nbsp; 
Those documents include new evidence of 
coalition forces’ involvement 
in civilian casualties in 

Iraq 
and 

Afghanistan. 
The 
nearly 10,000 pages that the ACLU is making public today include 
courts martial 
proceedings and military investigations regarding the 
possible wrongful death of 
civilians. The documents released by the 
ACLU today are available online in a 
searchable database at <br><a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.aclu.org/natsec/foia/log2.html">www.aclu.org/natsec/foia/log2.html 

</a>
</p><p>"The secrecy that 
surrounds the human costs of these wars keeps 
Americans from knowing what is 
being done in our name," said Nasrina 
Bargzie, an attorney in ACLU's National 
Security Project. "When the 
exigencies of war and the Pentagon’s policies 
interfere with the free 
flow of information, we must rely on our own 
government’s documents and 
records to help Americans make informed 
decisions."&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since 

U.S. 
troops 
first set foot in 

Afghanistan 
in 
2001, the Defense Department has gone to unprecedented lengths to 
control and 
suppress information about the human costs of war.&nbsp; 

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The ACLU pointed out that 
during both the wars in 

Afghanistan 
and 

Iraq, 
the 
Defense Department has instituted numerous policies designed to 
control 
information about the human costs of war. These policies 
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Banning photographers on 

U.S. 
military 
bases from covering the arrival of caskets containing the 
remains of 

U.S. 
soldiers 
killed overseas; 
</li><li>
Paying Iraqi journalists to write positive accounts of the 

U.S. 
war effort; 

</li><li>
Inviting 

U.S. 
journalists 
to "embed" with military units but requiring them to submit 
their stories for 
pre-publication review; 
</li><li>
Erasing journalists' footage of civilian deaths in 

Afghanistan; 
and 

</li><li>
Refusing to disclose statistics on civilian casualties. 

</li></ul>

<p>The files made public 
today cast further light on the killings of 
Iraqi and Afghan civilians in the 
conflict zones. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One file describes the 
court martial proceeding of a 

U.S. 
soldier who 
shot an Iraqi man at close range in the head.&nbsp; The 
Iraqi man had been taken prisoner 
after a battle.&nbsp; Prior to the 
shooting, the solider had told another soldier that he wanted to shoot 
the 
prisoner.&nbsp; The other soldier told 
him not to, but 
minutes later heard the shot.&nbsp; After hearing testimony from many of the 
soldiers involved in the incident, an Army Investigating Officer 
recommended 
that a general courts martial be convened and noted: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"One 
issue that was highlighted during the hearing was the 
testifying Soldier’s 
general lack of understanding, knowledge, and 
training on the treatment of enemy 
prisoners, Rules of Engagement 
(ROE), and use of force.&nbsp; Although, most Soldiers testified that 

they received some prisoner handling training prior to deployment in 
either a 
classroom briefing setting or a classroom briefing followed by 
hands on 
training, the majority of the Soldiers who testified seem to 
be uncomfortable on 
how they were to search and then secure enemy 
prisoners . . . .&nbsp; I do not believe any one soldier could 

articulate the same understanding of the ROE and use of force 
guidance.&nbsp; I recommend that additionally [sic] 
training be 
conducted for both units on prisoner handling, ROE, and use of force 
. 
. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The soldier was tried by 
court martial and acquitted by a jury of 
officers and enlisted men.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Another file describes an 
investigation of the killing of two Afghan 
men that was prompted by a report in 
the New York Times. 

U.S. 
soldiers 
allegedly shot and killed two fleeing villagers.&nbsp; While 
noting that the investigators had 
declined to exhume the bodies or 
obtain a copy of the Afghan police report on 
the incident, the 
investigation concluded that there was "insufficient evidence 
to prove 
if [four Special Forces soldiers] committed the offense of 

Murder."&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yet another file 
describes an investigation of a riot at a 

U.S. 
interment 
facility at Camp Bucca, 
Iraq, evidently 
related to 
claims that 
U.S. 

personnel had defaced the Qur’an.&nbsp; 
At least four Iraqi 
prisoners were shot and killed by Coalition Forces 
during the 
disturbance. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>One of the few files in 
which an investigation recommended 
disciplinary action involved the death of a 
six-month old child who 
died in a traffic accident.&nbsp; The file determined that the 

U.S. 
driver 
should be charged with negligent homicide and reckless 
endangerment. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in 
United States District Court for the 
District of 

Columbia. 
Attorneys on the FOIA 
project are Wizner, Bargzie, and Jameel Jaffer of 
the national ACLU, 
and Art Spitzer of the ACLU of the National Capital 

Area.</p>

</p>

<p>In a separate project, 
the ACLU filed a FOIA request in October 2003 
for records concerning the abuse 
of prisoners held by 

U.S. 
forces in 

Iraq, 
Afghanistan, 
and 
Guantánamo 

Bay. To date, that request 
has 
resulted in the release of more than 100,000 pages, all of which 
are available 
online at: <a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia">www.aclu.org/torturefoia</a>. 
Litigation regarding that FOIA request is ongoing.
