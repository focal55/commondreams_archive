<p>JAPAN - AUGUST 6 - Sixty-two years ago on August 6th, a uranium-type atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and a Plutonium-type atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki three days later on August 9th. Both were indiscriminate bombings, both targeted the two city’s civilians and both starkly violated international law. We offer our deepest sympathy to the families of the people who lost their lives on not only August 6th and August 9th but also those who died from the fallout of the two bombs – over 400,000 people - and share the suffering of those who have survived through various levels of the radiation contamination.
<P></P>Greenpeace was founded in 1971 with the aim of creating a world without nuclear threats. The unprecedented tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki bring home the reality of such a nuclear threat in our world. It proves categorically that we must abandon all nuclear weapons, nuclear power generation and plutonium recycling altogether.

<P></P>We Japanese are not only victims of the war, but also perpetrators, who created 20 million victims in the Asia-Pacific region, including the victims of the first ever indiscriminate aerial bombings of the Chinese cities of Nanking and Chongqing, which ultimately led to the two atomic bombings by the United States of America. Hiroshima and Nagasaki must never be allowed to happen again in any region or country; war is not and never will be an answer.

<P></P>The post-Second World War Japanese Constitution was a treasure box, which designated a future without war. It was only earned through the tremendous mistakes we made in the Asia-Pacific War and the tragic experiences of being victims of the two atomic bombings. Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war forever as a means of settling international disputes, was the shining pearl in the treasure box. However, even the treasures of the Japanese Constitution we have dearly guarded for 60 years since its enactment could tarnish and get discarded if we don’t protect them and put them to good use. The current Prime Minister with the formal backing of the ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party, is openly aiming at the removal of the Article 9 enabling Japan to go to war.

<P></P>In 2005, Greenpeace released a joint statement “No More Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Stop Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant” signed by 28 Executive directors world-\wide on the Hiroshima Memorial Day as a gesture to renew our pledge for peace. Although we face even more nuclear and war threats today, our resolve remains just as firm. We will protect Article 9 and ‘aspire sincerely’ to strengthen our efforts to bring about a world without nuclear threats and war. <!-- #EndEditable -->
