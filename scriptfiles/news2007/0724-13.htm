<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 24 - Free Press commended Sen. Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and his colleagues for introducing
legislation to bring broadband competition to communities across
the country. Co-sponsored by Sens. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), John
Kerry (D-Mass.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.)
and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), the bipartisan "Community Broadband
Act of 2007" would ensure that local governments are not
prevented from providing broadband networks to their residents
and businesses. 


</p><p>Free Press Policy Director Ben Scott issued the
following statement: 

</p><p>"Senator Lautenberg and his colleagues must be
commended for introducing legislation that promotes the right of
communities to provide broadband Internet services to all their
citizens. Community Internet networks provide an essential
catalyst for market competition, economic development and
universal, affordable Internet access for everyone. 

</p><p>"High-speed Internet access is rapidly becoming
one of the most important services in our economy and society.
But lack of competition has left too many American cities and
towns stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide. Compared to
the rest of the developed world, our prices are too high and our
speeds are too slow. 

</p><p>"The Community Broadband Act would empower local
governments to bring the benefits of broadband to their
citizens. With millions still lacking the economic benefits of
high-speed Internet services, we urge Congress to move this
critical legislation forward."
