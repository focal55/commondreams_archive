<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - Nationwide, January 23, 2007 – Members of Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), an organization of over 3,200 military families who are opposed to the war in Iraq, are available to comment on:

<p>·        President Bush’s State of the Union Address on January 23: Military families available to respond include those with loved ones currently in Iraq, those with loved ones soon to deploy/redeploy, those with loved ones affected by President Bush’s recent announcement of the war’s escalation, those with loved ones who have returned wounded physically and/or mentally, and those with loved ones who died as a result of the war in Iraq.

<p>·        January 27 March on Washington: 150 military families from 31 states will gather in Washington DC on January 27th in a contingent with Iraq War Veterans, Active Duty Troops and Veterans of other conflicts and eras, joining others from around the country calling for an end to the Iraq War. MFSO members will attend meetings in Congressional offices on Friday, January 26 and Monday, January 29 to tell Senators and Members of Congress to Support Our Troops by De-Funding the War, Bring Our Troops Home Now and Take Care of Them When They Get Here.
