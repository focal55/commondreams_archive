<p>NEW YORK - AUGUST 7 - MADRE, an international women's human rights organization, calls for a change in US food aid policy so that it reaches more people and supports local farmers in countries affected by food crises. MADRE is mobilizing its 23,000 members to call for a provision in the 2007 US Farm Bill--set to be reauthorized by Congress next month--that would extend the reach and efficiency of international US food aid.</p>

<p>The US is the world's biggest provider of food aid, spending $2 billion annually. But the entire amount is earmarked for US-based companies that grow, package, and ship federal food aid. The system rewards the few agribusiness giants already slated to receive $26 billion in subsidies by the Farm Bill. MADRE supports a proposal by the Bush Administration to transfer about $300 million in subsidies (roughly 25 percent of the budget for food aid) to enable food to be purchased by local farmers in the country or region in need.</p>

<p>As reported by <em>The New York Times</em> on July 31, the UN World Food Program found that it was able to obtain 75 percent more corn to feed hungry families in Africa between 2001 and 2005 by buying corn from local farmers in Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia instead of from US factory farms.</p>

<p>Globally, nearly 800 million people are chronically hungry--almost 70 percent of them are women and girls. Issues of world hunger and food security are central to women's human rights. MADRE's upcoming Food for Life Campaign will call for a US Farm Bill that upholds international human rights standards, including the right to food, and supports sustainable solutions to interconnected global problems of hunger, health, nutrition, poverty, biodiversity, climate change, labor rights, migration, Indigenous rights, and women's human rights, through concrete policy changes.</p>

<p>Vivian Stromberg, MADRE's Executive Director, said recently, "Food aid policy has to include long-term goals of combating hunger and poverty. Buying food from local farmers in the Global South instead of threatening their livelihoods by dumping subsidized US-grown food on local markets is a clear step in the right direction. Besides, how often do we get <font color="#000000">to support a policy that President Bush is backing?"</font></p>
