<p>WASHINGTON, DC - September 17 - The American Civil Liberties Union urges the Senate to refuse to confirm 
attorney general nominee Michael B. Mukasey, or any nominee, unless he or she 
pledges under oath to meet the four demands listed below.</p>

<p>"After enduring almost three years of a broken Justice Department under an 
attorney general with one of the worst civil liberties records in our nation’s 
history, Congress must ensure that the next attorney general faithfully perform 
his or her oath to uphold the Constitution," said Anthony D. Romero, Executive 
Director of the ACLU. "Before confirming anyone for attorney general, it is 
imperative that the Senate receive a pledge under oath that the nominee’s first 
allegiance will be to the rule of law and the Constitution, not to a president 
or a political party."</p>
<p>In particular, the ACLU said the Senate should refuse to confirm Michael 
Mukasey or any nominee unless the nominee promises under oath to take the 
following four steps within the first thirty days in office:</p>
<ul><li>Turn over to the Judiciary Committee all documents in the Justice 
Department's possession concerning the authorization to monitor any phone call 
in the United States without a warrant, and concerning the use of national 
security letters to obtain documents anywhere in America.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Turn over to the Judiciary Committee all documents in the Justice 
Department's possession authorizing the use of any interrogation or detention 
practices that are not authorized by the Army Field Manual on Interrogations, as 
well as any documents interpreting or analyzing any legal prohibitions on 
torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Appoint an outside special counsel for the investigation and, if 
appropriate, prosecution of any person who violated federal laws protecting 
detainees against torture and abuse, or who violated federal laws against 
wiretapping within the United States without a warrant.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Create a blue-ribbon committee of civil rights advisors to focus on 
restoring the Civil Rights Division to its historic role as the nation's premier 
and nonpartisan civil rights enforcement agency.</li></ul>
<p>Christopher Anders, Senior Legislative Counsel of the Washington Legislative 
Office of the ACLU said, "After two and a half years of dodging and hiding the 
ball by Attorney General Gonzales on core civil liberties and civil rights 
duties of the attorney general, the Senate cannot afford to accept anything less 
than a pledge – under oath – from the nominee that he will complete this four 
part attorney general's to-do list within 30 days of confirmation. The Senate 
shouldn’t accept empty promises but only a specific pledge under oath to clean 
up the mess left by Gonzales."<!-- #EndEditable -->
