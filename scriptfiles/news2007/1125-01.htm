<p>WORLDWIDE - November 25 - In 2006, the first Global Orgasm for Peace focused on the escalation of tensions between the Govern-Men of the USA and Iran. One year later, some of those in power still want to declare war and Americans are waiting to be given another manufactured excuse to support it. So we are preparing to launch the Second Annual Synchronized GlobalOrgasm for Peace.
<P></P>
<strong>WHO?</strong> All Men and Women, you and everyone you know.
<P></P>
<strong>WHERE?</strong> Everywhere in the world, but especially in countries with weapons of mass destruction and places where violence is used in place of mediation.
<P></P>
<strong>WHEN?</strong> This year we are synchronizing on the actual moment of the Solstice (Winter in the northern hemisphere, Summer in the south) for maximum concentrated effect: Solstice Day - Saturday, December 22nd at 06:08 Universal Coordinated Time (GMT), which is 09:08 Baghdad time; 09:38 Tehran time; 01:08 Washington, DC time; 17:08 Sydney time; 14:08 Hong Kong time; 11:38, New Delhi time; 09:08 Moscow time; Friday, December 21st, at 22:08 San Francisco time.
<P></P>
<strong>WHY?</strong> To effect positive change in the energy field of the Earth through input of the largest possible instantaneous surge of human biological, mental and spiritual energy.
<P></P>
<strong>The Science </strong>
<P></P>
The Global Consciousness Project (http://noosphere.princeton.edu) in Princeton, NJ, runs a network of Random Event Generators around the world, which record changes in their randomness during global events. The results show that human consciousness can be measured to have a global effect on matter and energy during widely-watched events such as the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, large antiwar protests, natural catastrophes, acts of war and mass meditations. Concentrated consciousness has measurable effects.
<P></P>
Our minds influence Matter and Quantum Energy fields , so by concentrating our thoughts during and after The Big O on peace and partnership, the combination of high orgasmic energy combined with mindful intention for peace could reduce global levels of violence, hatred and fear.
<P></P>
The world is full of men with axes to grind and weapons to fire in displays of their superiority over others. It is time to spare the planet from Alpha Male concepts of 'progress', 'growth' and Manifest Destiny, which are endangering all of us. True partnership between the Masculine and Feminine that is within all women and men may enable our species to survive in relative harmony. The GlobalOrgasm for Peace is one attempt to begin that process.
