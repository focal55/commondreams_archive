<p> WASHINGTON - February 16 - 
<p>DAVID BARSAMIAN, <a href="mailto:barsamian@riseup.net">barsamian@riseup.net</a>, <a href="http://www.alternativeradio.org" target="_new">http://www.alternativeradio.org</a><br>
Barsamian has just returned from Iran and is author of the 
forthcoming book "Targeting Iran." He said today: "Virtually everything 
the Bush administration has done has made things more difficult for 
Iranian reformers. The moderate Khatami government helped the U.S. oust 
the Taliban in 2001; in return Bush called Iran part of the 'axis of 
evil.' Khatami's 2003 offer to negotiate all differences between the two 
countries was rebuffed, setting the stage for Ahmadinejad becoming 
president. Virtually every Iranian I met with is embarrassed by his 
actions, especially the 'holocaust conference.' ... Now, the U.S. has 
two aircraft carrier groups near Iran and the threat of an attack looms."

<p>DAVID LINDORFF, <a href="mailto:dlindorff@yahoo.com">dlindorff@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.ThisCantBeHappening.ne" target="_new">http://www.ThisCantBeHappening.ne</a>t
    <br>
Lindorff wrote the piece "A word of caution on U.S. claims of 
Iranian weapons killing GIs." He said today: "Why do those bombs that 
they displayed as 'evidence' of Iranian perfidy have U.S. English words 
and dates on them? ... Newspapers were reporting as much as two years 
ago that insurgents had figured out how to make such devices themselves 
(the technology was invented by a U.S. naval engineer in 1888!). The BBC 
reported in 2005: 'According to defense sources, basic armor-piercing 
weapons are easy to manufacture, drawing on principles discovered more 
than a century ago and in use since World War Two.'"

    Lindorff is co-author of the book "The Case for Impeachment: The 
Legal Argument for Removing President George W. Bush from Office."

<p>STEPHEN ZUNES, <a href="mailto:zunes@usfca.edu">zunes@usfca.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.stephenzunes.org" target="_new">http://www.stephenzunes.org<br>
</a>Professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, Zunes just 
wrote the piece "Iran in Iraq?" which states: "Faced with growing public 
opposition to the U.S. war in Iraq, the Bush administration has been 
desperately trying to divert attention to Iran. Washington has gone so 
far as to make a series of dubious and unfounded charges that blame the 
Iranian government for the difficulties facing American forces fighting 
the Iraqi insurgency." http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3996
    Zunes is author of the book "Tinderbox: U.S. Middle East Policy and 
the Roots of Terrorism" and is Middle East editor for Foreign Policy in Focus.
