<p>WASHINGTON - November 27 - Anti-LGBT activists have filed a lawsuit in U.S. Federal Court attempting to repeal a new law designed to protect students that was recently signed into law by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. A coalition of conservative organizations is attempting to undo student safeguards designed to protect all youth, including those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT).
<P></P>
The Student Civil Rights Act, SB 777, clarifies and reinforces existing protections currently in the state’s education code, including California’s definition of gender, which has been in place since 2000. The bill was authored by Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, and sponsored by Equality California. SB 777, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2008, protects students from harassment and bullying in public schools by making sure teachers and school administrators understand their responsibilities to protect youth and make California schools safer. Students are protected based on gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation. 
<P></P>
Approximately 30 percent of California youth in grades seven to 11 report experiencing harassment or bullying based on their actual or perceived race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation, according to the 2006 California Healthy Kids Survey.

<strong>Statement by EQCA Executive Director Geoff Kors:
</strong>
<P></P>
“Both the Legislature and the governor have sent the clear message that discrimination will not be tolerated in California’s public schools,” said EQCA Executive Director Geoff Kors. “It is ironic that organizations that claim to support families are working to overturn a law that will protect students and help keep them in school.  Equality California will work to preserve this law and ensure that all California students are safe in school.”
