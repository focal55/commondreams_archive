<p>  WASHINGTON - October 1 – The government needs to look at the overall 
impacts of building walls along Arizona’s border before constructing additional segments, 
according to a formal appeal filed today by two national 
conservation groups. The joint appeal to the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) and Department of the 
Interior asks that the government prohibit construction of 
a border wall within the San Pedro Riparian National 
Conservation Area (NCA) until it can comprehensively assess the environmental 
impacts on wildlife and protected federal lands in 
Arizona.</p>
<p>“The San Pedro National Conservation Area is an 
irreplaceable national treasure. Putting a fence right through the middle of it 
will rob America of one of its most 
important wildlife areas, but it won’t make 
America any safer,” said Jamie 
Rappaport Clark, executive vice president of Defenders of 
Wildlife. “The decision to build a wall in this unique area points out the 
absurdity of the government’s ill-conceived approach to securing 
America’s borders. Meanwhile, the government isn't even 
considering the cumulative impacts of these wall segments on wildlife and 
habitat. They haven’t taken a step back to look at the whole picture—and right 
now that picture looks bleak.”</p>
<p>The appeal by Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra 
Club challenges the short-sighted decision to build a wall through the San 
Pedro NCA, which is one of the American Southwest’s most unique and biologically 
diverse areas. The San Pedro region has been designated as a 
World Heritage Natural Area by the United Nations 
World Heritage program. Some 250 species of 
migratory birds have been recorded in the area, which led to its designation as a 
Globally Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society, 
American Bird Conservancy, and the international Commission 
for Environmental Cooperation. The 
San Pedro River is one of the last free-flowing rivers in the 
United 
States, and its natural beauty and diverse wildlife 
attract visitors from around the globe. </p>
<p>The appeal specifically challenges a 
BLM decision that permits construction of a wall and 
a new road within the San Pedro Riparian NCA. According to the BLM, the proposed 
fencing across the desert arroyos that feed the San Pedro River would cause erosion, sediment build-up and 
possibly even shift the entire riverbed. These changes could be disastrous 
for the cottonwood-willow woodlands and the wildlife 
that depend on this habitat. Construction of the wall could also physically 
isolate numerous wildlife species in Arizona that have populations in Mexico, 
including jaguar, ocelot, coati, gray and kit fox, badger, black bear, ringtail 
cat and unique subspecies of deer and squirrel.</p>
<p>The San Pedro wall is just one of six wall 
segments proposed since the beginning of the year along 
Arizona’s border with 
Mexico, including the San Pedro River, Organ Pipe Cactus National 
Monument 
and Buenos 
Aires 
National 
Monument. 
At least two of these segments are already under construction. Under the 
National Environmental Policy Act, federal agencies are required to consider 
alternatives and review the cumulative environmental impacts of different 
federal actions that are occurring at the same time in the same area. Such 
comprehensive assessments are necessary to determine how best to minimize the 
impacts of border security measures on wildlife, wildlands and 
border communities. </p>
<p>On September 24, the Department of Homeland 
Security announced that it would complete comprehensive Environmental Impact 
Statements concerning the cumulative impacts of planned border fence 
construction along much of the Texas border with 
Mexico. In Arizona, however, where construction on some segments of 
the fence has already begun, no such effort has been made. 
</p>

<p>“It’s an encouraging step 
in the right direction that the government has agreed to do a comprehensive 
assessment in Texas, but Arizona is the place where bulldozers are tearing up the 
borderland as we speak,” said 
Sean 
Sullivan, executive 
committee member for the Sierra Club Rincon (Southern Arizona) group. “Arizona’s border wall is already under construction in certain 
places, and the government has a responsibility to make sure its actions are 
thoroughly examined before it starts any new projects, especially in areas 
as sensitive as the San Pedro.”</p>
