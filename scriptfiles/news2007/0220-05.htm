<p>TRENTON, New Jersey - February 20 - The American Civil Liberties Union today called on the New 
Jersey Supreme Court to protect women&#8217;s reproductive rights and physicians&#8217; free 
speech rights.&nbsp; The ACLU urged the court to overturn a lower court medical 
malpractice decision that would have the effect of improperly forcing physicians 
to give a non-medical, value-laden speech to their patients before performing an 
abortion. 
<P>&#8220;Forcing women to listen to non-medical, moral judgments from their doctors 
prior to an abortion violates both state and federal constitutions,&#8221; said 
Talcott Camp, a deputy director with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, who 
argued the ACLU&#8217;s position before the court today.&nbsp; &#8220;Doctors should not be 
compelled to act as an ideological mouthpiece when caring for their 
patients.&#8221;</P>
<P>In 1998, Rosa Acuna brought a medical malpractice lawsuit against a doctor in 
New Jersey, claiming that he had failed to properly inform her at the time of 
her abortion that the embryo was a &#8220;complete, separate, unique and irreplaceable 
human being&#8221; with whom she had &#8220;an existing relationship,&#8221; and his failure to do 
so caused her emotional distress.&nbsp; </P>
<P>According to court papers, Acuna, who had two children prior to her abortion, 
stated that at the time of her abortion she understood that she was pregnant and 
signed a form consenting to the procedure.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;This case is nothing more than a backdoor attempt to enact an extreme 
biased-counseling law - something our legislature and governor have refused to 
do,&#8221; said Deborah Jacobs, Executive Director of the ACLU of New 
Jersey.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Today&#8217;s argument before the New Jersey Supreme Court focused on whether 
Acuna&#8217;s case should go to a jury trial.</P>
<P>The ACLU argued that an unfavorable decision in this case could extend far 
beyond abortion, including interfering with physicians prescribing certain birth 
control methods, pharmacists dispensing birth control pills and emergency 
contraception, and emergency room personnel treating sexual assault 
survivors.</P>
<P>Today&#8217;s case is <EM>Acuna v. Turkish</EM> (Docket No. 59, 525).&nbsp; Lawyers on the 
friend-of-the-court brief include Camp and Brigitte Amiri of the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project and Edward Barocas of the ACLU of New Jersey.&nbsp;
