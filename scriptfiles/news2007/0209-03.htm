<p>WASHINGTON - February 9 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is taking several 
          steps to help level the playing field for farmers in Wisconsin. As the 
          Farm Bill debate approaches, Feingold is working for increased competition 
          in the agriculture industry and working to prevent anti-competitive 
          practices by large agribusinesses that harm family farmers. </p>
          <p>Feingold has long led the fight against mandatory binding arbitration 
            clauses in agricultural contracts and pushed for more accountability 
            in cheese trading. Earlier this year, Feingold and Senator Charles 
            Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Fair Contracts for Growers Act, which 
            would require both parties entering into a livestock or poultry contracts 
            to agree in writing to pursue arbitration after a dispute arises. 
            These non-negotiable agricultural production contracts essentially 
            force farmers or growers to waive their rights to take legal action 
            against the agribusiness, even in the event of fraud, misrepresentation, 
            discrimination, or breach of contract. Feingold also plans to work 
            with his colleagues to introduce and include broader competition legislation 
            in the Farm Bill. </p>
          <p>&#8220;None of our farmers should be forced to waive their legal 
            protections, leaving themselves more vulnerable to fraud and abuse,&#8221; 
            Feingold said. </p>
          <p>Last year, Feingold called on the Government Accountability Office 
            (GAO) to study if cheese trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
            (CME) is susceptible to price manipulation and suggest improvements 
            that may be needed. Feingold and a bipartisan coalition of Senators 
            led the effort to request that GAO Comptroller General David Walker 
            study the nearly ten-year-old discovery of possible price manipulation 
            in cheese trading on the old National Cheese Exchange based in Green 
            Bay, Wisconsin. The study of the CME should be released later this 
            year in time for its recommendation to be considered as part of the 
            Farm Bill. </p>
          <p>&#8220;The prices that dairy farmers and cheese makers receive for 
            their products are extremely important to Wisconsin, so it is vital 
            that they have confidence in them,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;I 
            look forward to learning the outcome of this much-needed study.&#8221;</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
