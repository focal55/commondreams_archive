<p>WASHINGTON - September 20 - Veto Threat Contradicts President’s Promises to Expand Children’s Health Coverage at the 2004 Republican Convention

<P></P>Today, President Bush stated that he intends to veto pending legislation that would reauthorize the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (which expires on September 30) and would extend health coverage to approximately 4 million uninsured children. The following is the statement from Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA, about the President’s veto threat:

<P></P>“During his re-nomination speech at the Republican Convention in 2004, President Bush promised that he ‘would lead an aggressive effort’ to enroll uninsured children into public health coverage so they will ‘have a healthy start in life.’ Now that the President has the opportunity to fulfill his promise, he plans to veto the very legislation that would accomplish this purpose.

<P></P>“The President is turning a cold shoulder on America’s children. To make matters worse, he now claims that people who disagree with him are playing politics with America’s children. His actions and protestations are the epitome of hypocrisy: He is taking a program that has always had broad bipartisan support and making it a political football.

<P></P>“The President disingenuously claims that the children’s health bill will lead to a government takeover of our health care system. However, the very groups that most strongly oppose a government takeover – the insurance and pharmaceutical companies as well as hospitals and physician groups – all support the children’s health bill.

<P></P>“The President’s actions will be very harmful America’s children. It will hurt uninsured children whose education and development opportunities will be stunted.

<P></P>“We call on the President to reconsider his veto threat and provide needed help to our nation’s children.”
