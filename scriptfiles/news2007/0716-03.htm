(in front of the Recruiting Station)
<P></P>Activists with the Troops Out Now Coalition (TONC) and other antiwar organizations in the Tri-State area are planning a 5 pm rally on Monday, July 16 in front of the Times Square Recruiting Center.

<P></P>Larry Holmes, an national organizer with TONC, said, "We've all heard the preliminary report from Iraq last week.  Bush has failed to subdue the resistance of the Iraqi people who are fighting against occupation.  The overwhelming majority of the people want the war to end.  Yet Bush just continues with his 'stay the course' message. More than 600,000 Iraqis and 3,600 U.S. soldiers are dead - It's time to bring the troops home now.  Not next year sometime, not sometime in 2009 or 2010, but right now."

<P></P>Sharon Black, a long-time labor activist working with TONC, said, "President Bush has made it clear that he has no intention the occupation -- and so have the Democrats in Congress.  Despite being elected to control of the House and Senate with a mandate from the people to end the war, they have completely capitulated to the Bush Administration.  The only force that will stop this war is a massive grassroots tidal wave of protest."

<P></P>Holmes added that Monday's rally will be a kick-off for a major mobilizing campaign building for a massive march on the White House on September 29 and an Encampment to Stop the War on the lawn in front of Congress during the week of September 22-29. </i><!-- #EndEditable -->
