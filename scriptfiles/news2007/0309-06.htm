<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. &#8211; March 9 &#8211;&nbsp; Below is a Sierra Club statement responding to today’s announcement that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers re-issued and expanded its nationwide permits.  Under the Clean Water Act, nationwide permits are supposed to be issued only for projects that will cause minimal environmental damage. 

<p>"We are dismayed that the Army Corps of Engineers is authorizing the destruction of our drinking water sources, streams and wetlands on such a massive scale. These general permits give approval for mining companies and others to fill in streams and wetlands that protect homes from flooding and help provide clean drinking water. 

<p>"Under the Clean Water Act, nationwide permits are only to be issued for projects that will cause minimal environmental damage. Yet in Appalachia alone, mountaintop removal mining operations using nationwide permits have completely buried over 700 miles of streams in mining waste and another 500 stream miles have been seriously harmed. If destroying more than 1,000 miles of streams is minimal, what would the Corps call significant? 

<p>"The Corps has clearly disregarded the intention of the Clean Water Act, and instead of acting to protect our waters has now taken another step toward their destruction."
