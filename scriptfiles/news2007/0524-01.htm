<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 24 - There are ways Congress can end the bloody, unwinnable occupation in Iraq, and ways not to.  The approach of the Democratic leadership has utterly failed – as they now prepare to give President Bush $95 billion more war funding through a bill that no longer has any timelines for troop withdrawal.  

 

<P></P>In this 11th hour, PDA is contacting Congress to say:

 

<P></P>No blank check for an occupation that the overwhelming majority of Iraqis and U.S. troops in Iraq want ended.  
 

<P></P>Continued no-strings-attached funding means Iraq becomes the Democrats’ war. 
 

<P></P>How can you oppose a troop escalation while funding it in full? 
 

<P></P>And PDA is reminding Democrats of the only effective ways of ending the Iraq occupation:

 

<P></P>1)      Using the power of the purse to cut off funds to Iraq -- except those needed to safely withdraw our troops (and for humanitarian/reconstruction aid to the Iraqi people).

 

<P></P>2)      Using their investigative power to probe White House deceptions and distortions that propelled the Iraq invasion and occupation, and to impeach if necessary. 

 

<P></P>Commented PDA National Director Tim Carpenter: “While we’re distressed with Democratic leaders, PDA stands with the progressive stalwarts in Congress who continue to battle for an end to this occupation.” 

 

<P></P>Rep. Raul Grijalva, a PDA Advisory Board member, issued this statement today:  

 

<P></P>"I have opposed funding this war from the beginning….  The previous supplemental, The Iraq Accountability Act, though flawed and at odds with many of my beliefs, represented a chance for hope…. But I cannot in good conscience support this new version of an Iraq war funding bill…a paper tiger that will give the Administration an unfettered extension to this ill-conceived occupation, and an implied sanction by this Congress of the war.”
