<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 - Out-of-control CEO pay has made it into the debate on Capital Hill. A measure to cap executive pay tax deferrals may be included in the combination minimum wage/tax cut bill the Senate will try to move next week. We think this is only the beginning.

<p>Public awareness is high. We've been tracking average CEO pay to average worker pay (now 411 to 1) for 10 years, and our most recent report received more press attention than ever. Senator Jim Webb even mentioned CEO pay in his response to the State of the Union.

<p>We believe Congress will be pushed more and more to play a role in constraining CEO pay -- and rightly so.

<p>Available for comment are:

<p>* Meizhu Lui, executive director of United for a Fair Economy (UFE).

<p>* Mike Lapham, director of UFE's Responsible Wealth project.

<p>* Lee Farris, senior tax organizer at UFE.

<p>See the 2006 report on Executive Excess at <a href="http://www.faireconomy.org/reports/2006/ExecutiveExcess2006.pdf">http://www.faireconomy.org/reports/2006/ExecutiveExcess2006.pdf</a>.

<p>Data from the report:<br>

If the minimum wage had risen at the same pace as CEO pay since 1990, it would be worth $22.61 today, rather than today's actual rate of $5.15, and still far more than Congress' new 2009 target of $7.25.

<p>Friday's NBC/WSJ poll that shows CEO pay is one of the top seven issues that disturb Americans:

another.)
