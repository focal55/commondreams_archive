Conservation
groups took the first steps Tuesday to keep protections in place for
Yellowstone's grizzly bears.&nbsp;Eight conservation groups,
represented by Earthjustice, filed a notice with the federal government
of their intent to sue to restore Endangered Species Act protections to
the bears.&nbsp;The government intends to lift those protections on
April 30.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
Most conservation groups and scientists oppose the move to lift the
protections, citing evidence that Yellowstone's grizzlies face a
troubling future because of global warming.&nbsp;Yellowstone grizzlies
depend on the seeds produced by the whitebark pine tree as a main food
source used to fatten up before winter hibernation.&nbsp;Global warming
is causing beetles to kill this key grizzly food source at alarming
rates.&nbsp;<p>"With global warming speeding up
reproduction of bark beetles that kill whitebark pine trees, we face a
future where every year is a bad year for whitebark pine, and the
consequence is every year is a declining year for Yellowstone
grizzlies," said Earthjustice attorney Doug Honnold. </p>
<p>Grizzly bears in the contiguous United States occupy only two
percent of their historic habitat.&nbsp;Only one percent of their
historic population levels survive today. </p>

<p>Lifting Endangered Species Act protections for grizzlies rescinds
limitations on road-building, logging, and oil and gas development in
much of the public lands currently used by grizzlies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of lands used by grizzlies today in the
Yellowstone ecosystem is outside of the designated recovery
area.&nbsp;Although the Fish and Wildlife Service counts the bears
outside of the protected area to conclude that the population meets
recovery levels, the agency has not taken steps to ensure the bears'
viability in those areas after delisting.</p>
<p>The government's decision to lift protections will also subject the
bears to hunting in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.&nbsp;In Wyoming, four
counties (Park, Fremont, Sublette, and Lincoln) have passed ordinances
and resolutions to express their intolerance of grizzly bears within
their borders.&nbsp;For example, Fremont County resolved in 2002 that
grizzly bears are an "unacceptable species" that constitutes "a threat
to the public health, safety, and livelihood" of the citizens of
Fremont County.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"We're disappointed that federal wildlife managers have abdicated
their responsibility to protect this magnificent animal, and we will
continue to fight for their survival," says Honnold.</p>
<p>The conservation groups filing the notice of intent to sue Tuesday
were the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Humane Society
of the United States, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Center for
Biological Diversity, Western Watershed Project, Great Bear Foundation,
and the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance.&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
