<p>WASHINGTON, DC - October 31 -A high resolution short film featuring an interview with prominent Indian social activist Medha Patkar on Indian land rights and the plight of farmers in that country is available free for wide distribution from the Global Oneness Project.

 
<P></P>
In this short film prominent Indian social activist Medha Patkar explains how the economic development model being imposed on India's farmers is neither inclusive nor sustainable. As natural resources become commodities and farming families lose the capacity to fulfill their own basic needs, Ms. Patkar makes the point that the consumerist paradigm may end up destroying living communities.

 
<P></P>
The 5:37 minute film, titled "A Threat to Living Communities" is shot on location in Delhi using HDV.  You can watch the film here: <a href="http://www.globalonenessproject.org/video/Medha-Patkar/1" target="_new">http://www.globalonenessproject.org/video/Medha-Patkar/1

The Global Oneness Project (GOP) is a living library of short films and interviews created with the intention of expanding people's awareness of what it means to be part of an increasingly globalized world.  Through the words and actions of individuals from many countries, the Global Oneness Project encourages humanity to embrace a broader perspective of "oneness," which includes not only our relationship with the earth, but the relationship and interconnectedness between all things.
