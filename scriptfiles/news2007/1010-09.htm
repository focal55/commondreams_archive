<p>   MILWAUKEE, WI - October 10 –  <i>In response to President Bush’s remarks regarding FISA today, Senator Feingold issued the following statement: </i>
<p></p>

“Once again the President is trying to use fear and exaggeration to intimidate Congress into granting the executive branch unchecked power that will put the rights of Americans at risk.  As it works to fix the hastily passed Protect America Act, Congress should stand up to the administration’s fear-mongering and correct that legislation’s fundamental flaws, such as the utter failure to protect the privacy of Americans at home and abroad, and the complete lack of meaningful oversight.  And it must reject the President’s demand for immunity for private entities that allegedly cooperated with his illegal warrantless wiretapping program while the President continues to hide his administration’s legal opinions justifying that program from Congress.  Congress can and must produce a bill that provides the tools needed to pursue suspected terrorists aggressively while also protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans.”
