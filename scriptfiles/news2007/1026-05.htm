<p>WASHINGTON - October 26 -<br>
  <br>
  WHO: Former Florida State Prison Warden Ron McAndrew (Participated in executions),
Former Louisiana Death Row Prisoner Moreese Bickham (removed from Louisiana's
death row by the Furman decision), Attorney Marshall Hartman (worked on historic
Furman case), Death Row Survivors, Murder Victim Family Members, and other leaders
of various anti-death penalty organizations.<P></P>

WHAT: Press Conference
<P></P>
WHEN: NOON, Friday, June 29, 2007, the 35th Anniversary of the Historic Furman Decision
<P></P>
WHERE: On the sidewalk in front of the United States Supreme Court in Washington, DC
<P></P>
WHY: July 29, 2007 marks the 35th anniversary of the Furman V. Georgia decision
in which the United States Supreme Court struck down all laws allowing executions
in the U.S.  Persons of interest noted above will join leaders of the anti-death
penalty movement in speaking out about recent developments regarding the issue,
noting how the death penalty continues to fail as a public policy in the United
States.
<P></P>
July 2, 2007 marks the 31st anniversary of the Gregg V. Georgia decision in which
the United States Supreme Court upheld laws written in various states to reinstate
the death penalty in the wake of the Furman decision in 1972.
<P></P>
This press conference is part of the Annual Fast & Vigil to Abolish the Death
Penalty at the US Supreme Court, wherein anti-death penalty activists will converge
on Washington, D.C. from Friday, June 29 through Monday, July 2 for four days of
activities commemorating the historic 1972 and 1976 Supreme Court rulings that
suspended the death penalty in the United States and later allowed executions to
resume. This is the fourteenth year in a row that the Abolitionist Action Committee
will hold its annual Fast and Vigil between the dates of these two landmark decisions.
Activists, many of whom are fasting the entire four days, are travelling to Washington
D.C. from across the United States and beyond.
<P></P>
Highlights of this highly visual and interactive annual event include live music
and evening teach-ins by death row survivors, murder victim family members, and
noted activists and scholars. Please see details at
http://www.abolition.org/starvin14/schedule.html
<P></P>
ATTENTION REPORTERS, EDITORS AND PRODUCERS: Consider interviews with activists
from your specific state or region. A press conference will be held at Noon on
Friday, June 29 on the sidewalk in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, but we are
available all day and evening on June 29 and 30, and July 1 and 2.  SEE THE LIST
OF SCHEDULED EVENING SPEAKERS.
<P></P>
RAIN ALERT:  In the event of rain or significant threat thereof, the press conference
and other events requiring amplification will take part inside the United Methodist
Church Building, immediately adjacent (across Maryland Ave. on 1st St.)
<P></P>

highly visible and effective public education for alternatives to the death penalty
through nonviolent direct action.<!-- #EndEditable -->
