<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 21 - Sarah 
Stephens, Director of The Center for Democracy in the America’s, issued the following statement 
praising Senators Baucus and Crapo, Representatives Rangel and Emerson, for 
their legislation to speed agriculture sales to Cuba and<span> to</span>&nbsp;increase travel to the island:</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">“The Bush administration came to 
office promising never to use food as a weapon, a promise it broke regarding 
sales of U.S. agriculture 
commodities to Cuba.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has repeatedly thrown up 
obstacles to food sales that have made it more difficult for U.S. farmers and ranchers to increase trade with 
Cuba and increasingly blocked 
travel by Americans to Cuba.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">“This legislation will help the 
U.S. farmer make more sales 
to Cuba and that’s important 
– because Cuba imports 84% of 
its food from foreign sources and U.S. farmers are among the only Americans who can 
travel to and trade with Cuba.<span>&nbsp; </span>U.S. farmers are America’s face in Cuba and our 
government should promote and not frustrate their presence on the island.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">“U.S. food sales to Cuba are 
important, even crucial, but they should not be our only form of contact between 
the American and Cuban people.<span>&nbsp; </span>As 
this legislation says, Congress should broadly legalize travel to Cuba, 
repealing the travel ban, and increasing contacts between our two countries 
across the board.<span>"</span><span> </span></p>
