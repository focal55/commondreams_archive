<p>GENEVA / BAGHDAD - January 18 - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided Kirkuk General Hospital with enough surgical and other medical supplies to treat 100 wounded persons today, one day after a truck packed with explosives killed 10 people and injured 42 others in the centre of the city. </div></div>

<div class="bodycontent">
<p>Similar aid was provided yesterday for Al-Kindi Teaching Hospital in Baghdad, following one of the deadliest days in recent weeks<font color="#FF0000">.</font> On 16 January, two car bombs killed some 70 people, mostly students from Al-Mustansiriya University. On the same day, dozens were also killed in different bombings and shootings. Al-Kindi Teaching Hospital received most of the injured and was in dire need of assistance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Civilians are considered by some as legitimate targets. This is an appalling fact, and it is unacceptable by any standard,&quot; said Karl Mattli, head of the ICRC delegation in Iraq. &quot;The massive influx of casualties is putting the Iraqi health-care system under considerable strain and the ICRC is doing its utmost to support it,&quot; he added. <br>
<br>
The conflict in Iraq continues to claim the lives of scores of civilians every day, notably in Baghdad. The ICRC provides emergency aid to victims whenever and wherever possible.
