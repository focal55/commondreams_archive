<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 28 - Amnesty International today urged both U.S. president George W. Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin to press each other on particular human rights issues during their summit in Kennebunkport, Maine this weekend.

<P></P>"Both Bush and Putin consider themselves defenders of human rights, yet their track records on protecting civil liberties and the rule of law reveal a 180 degree divergence from their words," said Larry Cox, Amnesty International USA executive director. "These men have a tremendous opportunity to move the human rights agenda forward, not only for Russians and Americans, but the entire world. Let us hope that these two leaders have the backbone to show some leadership."

<P></P>Amnesty International urged President Bush to raise the issue of accountability in Chechnya. While commending the recent verdict in North Caucasus district military court in Rostov-on-Don as an important step in challenging impunity, the organization cautioned that much more remains to be done.

<P></P>The organization appealed to President Bush to pressure Putin on what concrete steps are being taken to ensure that military exports are not used to fuel further conflict and human rights violations in Darfur. Amnesty International recently reported on the continued arms transfers to Sudan, with Russia one of the leading suppliers. According to the report, Russia has exported over $21 million in aircraft and equipment and over $13 million in helicopters and parts to the Sudanese government, which in turn uses those supplies to launch attacks in Darfur.

<P></P>Amnesty International calls on President Putin to end the intensifying harassment of Russian human rights defenders, noting that Russian journalist Anna Polikovskaya's murderer remains at large.

<P></P>In its letter to President Putin, Amnesty International asked the Russian leader to raise the issue of the death penalty in the United States. The organization praised the de facto moratorium on the practice in Russia and noting the growing global trend toward abolition. As the global call for the closing of the Guantanamo detention center increases, Putin was urged join that chorus and press President Bush on this issue.
