<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 12 - Farm Sanctuary, the nation’s leading farm animal protection organization, and Canada’s Global Action Network have released video and photographic evidence, taken by an undercover investigator of multiple animal cruelty violations committed at Elevages Perigord, Canada’s largest foie gras production facility in Quebec. The evidence has been submitted to Canadian authorities and both groups are urging prosecution.

 

<P></P>The photo and video evidence shows horrifying conditions endured by ducks and geese used in the production of foie gras, many of which violate Canadian animal welfare laws including:

 

<P></P>•           Tearing the heads of live ducks off

<P></P>•           Kicking, throwing and punching ducks

<P></P>•           Leaving ducklings to die of hypothermia and asphyxiation inside trash cans

<P></P>•           Bashing live ducks against walls and floors

<P></P>•           Suffocating and crushing live ducklings

<P></P>•           Force feeding ducks

<P></P>•           Slaughter of fully-conscious ducks

 

<P></P>“The evidence provided to the authorities in Canada shows clearly that the production of foie gras leads to egregious callousness and cruelty,” said Gene Baur, president of Farm Sanctuary.  “We’ve seen it in U.S. foie gras producers, and now we’ve seen it in Canada.  There’s no getting around it.  Foie gras equals cruelty.”

 

<P></P>The birds, who are de-beaked, de-toed and forced to live in extreme confinement in filthy, poorly-maintained cages, have liquid feed pressure-pumped down their throats through a metal pipe several times a day. This force feeding is known to cause bruising, lacerations, sores, organ rupture, and even death. It also creates the grossly oversized and diseased “fatty liver” for which foie gras is named. Gasping, vomiting and struggling to move, the birds endure this process every day at the end of their short lives.

 

<P></P>Andrew Plumbly, director of Global Action Network, said: “This industry has no place in civilized society and we are asking the Canadian government to outlaw the production of foie gras immediately. We are also calling on all consumers and food distributors to make the compassionate decision to stop buying foie gras.”

 

<P></P>Several researchers, scientist and veterinarians have viewed the footage and issued statements on the severity of the violations. Among them is Mohan Raj professor at the school of clinical veterinary science at the University of Bristol, UK. Who stated: “Force feeding of ducks and geese is one giant leap backward in human civilization. It is a cruel practice that must be stopped immediately.”

.

<P></P>Baur, Plumbly and Raj’s statements are echoed by a growing number of professionals who have issued statements and opinions on the practices at Elevages Perigord including Dr. Michael Appleby, welfare policy advisor for the World Society for the Protection of Animals; Veterinarian Laurie Siperstein-Cook, and  Ian Duncan, Chair of Animal Welfare at University of Guelph in Ontario.
