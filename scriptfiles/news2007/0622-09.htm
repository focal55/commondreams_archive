<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 22 - Since 
the disclosure of the National Security Agency’s domestic surveillance program 
in December of 2005, few facts about the origins of the program have come to 
light.&nbsp; Today the American Civil 
Liberties Union applauded the Senate Judiciary Committee for scheduling a vote 
to authorize subpoenas for documents on the legal underpinnings of the 
President’s wiretapping programs.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="text">“Subpoenaing these documents is the only way 
to find out exactly what kind of legal ground the president's warrantless 
wiretapping program was built on and how it is structured,” said Caroline 
Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office.&nbsp; “With recent revelations that those in 
the Justice Department threatened to resign over the program, Congress is 
obligated to demand the roadmap that led them there.&nbsp; Too many administration officials have 
been vague and, at times, outright uncooperative in the face of legitimate 
Congressional requests and panels.&nbsp; 
It’s time to cut through the stonewalling and get real answers.”</p>
<p class="text">The ACLU is requesting 
that the following documents be subpoenaed by Congress:</p>
<ul><li><span class="text">Executive 
branch memos and internal documents including emails from 2001 to 2007 
discussing the legality of warrantless surveillance</span>
</li><li><span class="text">Department 
of Justice “certifications” for the program</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
Executive 
orders authorizing the program</span>

</li><li><span class="text">
Any 
and all agreements between the government and telecommunications companies 
regarding their role in the program, including any indemnification 
agreements</span>
</li><li class="text">
Executive 
branch memos regarding current activities authorized by the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court</li></ul>
<p class="text">The ACLU is also 
requesting the sworn testimony of the following people regarding their role in 
the NSA warrantless wiretapping program:</p>
<ul><li><span class="text">Attorney 
General Alberto Gonzales</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
Vice 
President Dick Cheney</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
FBI 
Director Robert Mueller</span>
</li><li><span class="text">

Former 
NSA Director Michael Hayden</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
Former 
White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
Former 
Solicitor General Ted Olson</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
Former 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel John Yoo</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
Former 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Patrick Philbin</span>
</li><li><span class="text">
CEOs 
of Telecommunications companies complicit in the warrantless wiretapping program</span>

</li><li><span class="text">
Former 
Deputy Attorney General James Comey</span>
</li><li class="text">
Former 
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, Jack 
Goldsmith</li></ul>
<p class="text">The ACLU has been working 
actively in both the legislature and courts to seek answers in regards to the 
legal justification of the NSA’s program.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the revelation of 
the president’s domestic spying, the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the legal 
basis of the program on behalf of a 
coalition of criminal defense attorneys, journalists, and scholars.&nbsp; The government attempted to have the 
case dismissed based on national security and state secret concerns, but 
ultimately the judge agreed with the ACLU that the program was 
unconstitutional.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
government appealed and the case is currently awaiting a decision from the U.S. 
Court of Appeal for the Sixth Circuit.</p>
<p class="text">“A year and a half after the 
administration’s domestic spying became public, we still know very little about 
the program’s origins and how it functions,” said Fredrickson.&nbsp; “We ask that those in the House and 
Senate not back down until they receive answers.&nbsp; Americans’ rights and privacy were 
violated and we need to know why.”&nbsp; </p>
