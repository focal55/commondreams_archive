<p>   October 8–  Louisiana is the most corrupt state in the nation.
<p></p>
That’s according to an analysis of government data released today by Corporate Crime Reporter.
<p></p>
Louisiana (1), Mississippi (2), Kentucky (3), Alabama (4) and Ohio (5) are the top five most corrupt states in the country, according to the analysis.
<p></p>
Rounding out the top ten are Illinois (6), Pennsylvania (7), Florida (8), New Jersey (9), and New York (10).
<p></p>
“If you type the word ‘corruption’ into Google News, the vast majority of news stories that come up are from overseas,” said Russell Mokhiber, editor of Corporate Crime Reporter, a print weekly legal newsletter based in Washington, D.C. “But public corruption is booming right here in the USA.”
<p></p>
“There have been more than 20,000 public officials and private citizens convicted of public corruption over the past two decades,” Mokhiber said. “That’s an average of 1,000 a year for the last twenty years.”
<p></p>
Corporate Crime Reporter looked at the 35 most populous states in the nation. (The fifteen states with population of under two million were not included in the analysis.)
<p></p>
The ranking is based on data from the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section’s 2006 <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/pin/docs/arpt-2006.pdf" target="_new">report</a> – which was made public just last week.
<p></p>
The 2006 Justice Department report contains a compilation of all federal corruption convictions by state over the past decade.
<p></p>
“We added up the total convictions for each state from 1997 to 2006,” Mokhiber said. “We then calculated a corruption rate for each state, which we defined as the total number of public corruption convictions from 1997 to 2006 per 100,000 residents.”
<p></p>
Here are the 35 most populous states ranked by their corruption rate:
<p></p>
Louisiana (1)(7.67), Mississippi (2)(6.66), Kentucky (3)(5.18), Alabama (4)(4.76), Ohio (5)(4.69), Illinois (6)(4.68), Pennsylvania (7)(4.55), Florida (8)(4.47), New Jersey (9)(4.32), New York (10)(3.95).
<p></p>
Tennessee (11)(3.68), Virginia (12)(3.64), Oklahoma (13)(2.96), Connecticut (14)(2.80), Missouri (15)(2.79), Arkansas (16)(2.74), Massachusetts (17)(2.66), Texas (18)(2.44), Maryland (19)(2.31), Michigan (20)(2.14).
<p></p>
Georgia (21)(2.13), Wisconsin (22)(2.09), California (23)(2.07), North Carolina (24)(1.96), Arizona (25)(1.88), Indiana (26)(1.85), South Carolina (27)(1.74), Nevada (28) (1.72), Colorado (29)(1.56), Washington (30)(1.52).
<p></p>
Utah (31)(1.4117), Kansas (32)(1.4109), Minnesota (33)(1.24), Iowa (34)(0.91), Oregon (35)(0.68).
<p></p>
Mokhiber warned that the study has its limitations.
<p></p>
“The Justice Department is reporting only public corruption convictions that result from a federal prosecution,” Mokhiber said. “Convictions that result from a prosecution pursued by state district attorneys or attorneys general, for example, are not included in the Justice Department statistics. But the vast majority of public corruption prosecutions – perhaps as many as 80 percent – are brought by federal officials.”
<p></p>
“Also, public officials in any given state can be corrupt to the core, and if a federal prosecutor doesn’t have the resources or the sheer political will to bring the case and win a conviction, the public corruption will not be reflected in the Justice Department’s data set,” Mokhiber said.
<p></p>
Mokhiber said that in the most corrupt states, corruption is undermining public trust in politicians and government.
<p></p>
He cited a Monmouth University/Gannett New Jersey <a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/polling/admin/polls/MUP12_2.pdf" target="_new">poll</a> released last week which found that New Jersey residents are increasingly suspicious of their politicians.
<p></p>
The poll found 60 percent of residents say there is “a lot” of corruption in the state, up from 34 percent four years ago.
<p></p>
The poll also found that New Jerseyans think 60 percent of legislators are willing to sell out to lobbyists, up from 52 percent four years ago.
<p></p>
Mokhiber said he thought it was a good sign that citizens groups, like the Better Government Association (BGA) of Chicago, were organizing around the issue of public corruption – even giving awards to corruption fighters.
<p></p>
Later this month, for example, BGA will present its annual Civic Achievement <a href="http://www.bettergov.org/benefit.html" target="_new">Award</a> jointly to the U.S. Attorney’s office in Chicago and the Chicago Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for rooting out corruption in northern Illinois.
