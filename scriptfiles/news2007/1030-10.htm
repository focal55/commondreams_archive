<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - On Oct. 31, NOW President Kim Gandy will testify at a FCC hearing in Washington, D.C., on media ownership and the responsibility of TV and radio broadcasters to serve their local communities. Gandy also will speak at the Rally for Better Media outside FCC headquarters prior to the hearing.
<P></P>
"Women own a meager six percent of full-power radio stations and five percent of all TV stations in the U.S.," said Gandy. "How can we expect the media to reflect the diversity of our lives and cover issues that impact everyone when they are owned by a handful of rich conglomerates?"
<P></P>
<strong>What:</strong> FCC Public Hearing on Media Localism; Rally for Better Media
<P></P>
<strong>Who:</strong> NOW President Kim Gandy, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rep. Hilda Solis, Women's Media Center President Carol Jenkins, Rosa Clemente of R.E.A.C.Hip Hop Coalition and other media reform leaders and activists (those listed include FCC hearing panelists and rally speakers)
<P></P>
<strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, Oct. 31
<P></P>
<strong>Rally:</strong> 9:00am-10:30am
Hearing: 10:00am-2:00pm
<P></P>
<strong>Where:</strong> FCC Headquarters
445 12th Street SW, Washington, D.C.
<P></P>
As the FCC has allowed giant corporations to buy up more and more local media outlets, this consolidation has affected the content we see, hear and read. Women's voices, perspectives and issues are marginalized and sometimes ignored entirely.
<P></P>
FCC Chair Kevin Martin is determined to further relax regulations on media ownership, creating even greater consolidation. These rule changes could happen before the year is over.
<P></P>
"As we have for decades, NOW leaders and activists will speak out tomorrow to demand that the FCC take action to ensure that our media represent all the people." <!-- #EndEditable -->
