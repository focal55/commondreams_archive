<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 11 - Stonyfield Farm and Environmental Defense today launched a petition drive to urge Congress to expand farmland stewardship and protection programs in the 2007 Farm Bill. </p><p>This month, a message printed on over eight million Stonyfield Farm yogurt lids will tell consumers: “In the time it takes to eat this yogurt, ten acres of farmland will be lost to development” and urge consumers to take action such as signing a petition to Congress seeking more funds for USDA programs that reward farmers when they help preserve open spaces and provide a healthier environment. </p><p>Stonyfield Farm has been a leader in public outreach on health and the environment using its yogurt lids, website and consumer events to reach millions of consumers to build awareness and action on healthy food choices, climate change, and organic and family farming. </p><p>Congress will renew farm and food policies this year in the 2007 Farm Bill. </p><p>“Renewal of farm and food policies impacts all Americans,” said Gary Hirshberg, Stonyfield President and CE-Yo. “We’re losing farmland to development at a rate of two acres per minute. More than 80 percent of fruits and vegetables, and 60 percent of our dairy products, are in the path of the sprawl.” </p><p>More than 200 members of Congress have already co-sponsored legislation to boost USDA programs to reward farmland stewardship and protection. Currently, two out of three farmers and ranchers offering to share the cost of clean water and wildlife habitat are turned away due to funding shortfalls. </p><p>“The next Farm Bill is a chance to reward – not reject – farmers when they offer to meet our environmental challenges,” said Scott Faber, Campaign Director for Environmental Defense’s Healthy Farms, Healthy Food Campaign. “Now is the time for all Americans to add their voices to those who are calling for farm and food policies that help meet America’s energy, environment and health challenges.” </p><p>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.environmentaldefense.org/go/farms/%20" target="_new">www.environmentaldefense.org/go/farms/ </a></p>
