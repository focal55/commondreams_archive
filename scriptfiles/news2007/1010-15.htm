<P>San Francisco - October 10 - Today, a federal judge issued an injunction that blocks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from using backlogged and error-prone Social Security records to enforce immigration law.  In reaction to the court’s decision, SEIU Executive Vice President Eliseo Medina issued the following statement:
<P></P>
"Today, the court’s unequivocal decision to stop the “no match” madness is a victory for all workers and all well-meaning employers.  The federal court has seen the Administration’s Social Security “no match” regulations for what they are—an illegal, ill-conceived measure that would threaten thousands of innocent workers and lead to discrimination and massive workforce disruptions. 
<P></P>
"Today’s decision sends a clear message that punitive crackdowns that attempt to sidestep the law will not be tolerated.  Efforts to fix a badly broken immigration system must embody our good sense and our humanity.  We will not let an intolerant minority undermine the well-being of the majority. 
<P></P>
"It’s time to stop the growing current of unwise, enforcement-only immigration measures that are making life increasingly miserable for many of our nation’s hardest, most underpaid workers.  It’s time to stop the indiscriminate round-ups and get back to finding solutions that strengthen—rather than divide—our nation."
<P></P>
