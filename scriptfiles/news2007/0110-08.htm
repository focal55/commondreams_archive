<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - As the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares 
          to focus on the issue of data mining today, U.S. Senators Russ Feingold 
          (D-WI) and John Sununu (R-NH) have reintroduced legislation requiring 
          federal agencies to report to Congress on the use and development of 
          data mining programs. Feingold and Sununu previously introduced the 
          legislation in the 109th Congress. The legislation requires all federal 
          agencies to report to Congress, in classified form if need be, within 
          180 days and every year thereafter on certain data mining programs and 
          how these programs impact the civil liberties and privacy of Americans.
<p>&#8220;This bill is a way for Congress and the public to finally 
            understand what is going on behind the closed doors of the executive 
            branch so that we can start to have a policy discussion about data 
            mining that is long overdue,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;The possibility 
            of unchecked, secret use of data mining technology threatens one of 
            the most important values that we are fighting for in the war against 
            terrorism &#8211; freedom.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Data mining and other technologies can be essential tools 
            in detecting predictive patterns and possible outcomes from anonymous 
            records. However, it is imperative that we understand the impact of 
            such technology on Americans&#8217; personal privacy. In order to 
            do this, Congress must be fully informed of the current data mining 
            technologies, new ones that are being developed, the effectiveness 
            of those technologies, and the privacy protections in place,&#8221; 
            said Sununu. &#8220;Senator Feingold and I have worked on this topic 
            in the past, securing approval of legislative measures to explore 
            and analyze data mining technologies used by the Department of Homeland 
            Security, and the bill that has been introduced today continues an 
            effort to put in place appropriate Congressional oversight.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>Data mining technology is capable of reviewing and analyzing millions 
          of both public and private records on each and every American. Congress 
          needs further information about whether these types of programs are 
          effective in pinpointing terrorists and other criminals, and about the 
          privacy and civil liberties implications of looking for patterns of 
          criminal or terrorist activity in vast quantities of digital data.</p>
