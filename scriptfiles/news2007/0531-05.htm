<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - MAY 31 -Because at least 35 million Americans continue to face hunger on a regular basis, the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) today called upon the House and Senate Agriculture Committees to strengthen our nation’s Food Stamp Program during the impending mark up of the 2007 Farm Bill.  In a letter initiated by U.S. Representatives Lynn Woolsey and Barbara Lee – CPC Co-Chairs – and U.S. Representative James McGovern, member of the CPC’s Anti-Poverty Task Force, and co-signed by 94 of their House colleagues, the progressives urged U.S. Representative Collin Peterson, Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, and U.S. Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, to support and fund a strong nutrition title in the 2007 Farm Bill. (See attached letter.)  After cuts made in the 1996 Farm Bill, they decried that food stamp benefits currently average $21/week, which translates to a mere $1 per person per meal.

<P></P>“For many of us as CPC Members, the nutrition title is one of the single most important aspects of the farm bill,” U.S. Representative Lynn Woolsey (CA-06) stressed.  “It is plainly unacceptable in today’s America that at least 35 million Americans struggle constantly to meet their basic food needs.”

<P></P>“We cannot turn our back on the fact that hunger resulting from poverty is a daily reality for millions of Americans,” said U.S. Representative Barbara Lee (CA-09).  “strengthening the Food Stamp Program is the least that we can do.”

<P></P>“We have the resources to end hunger in America,” U.S. Representatives James McGovern said.  “What we need is the political will to make it happen.  It is essential that we strengthen the Food Stamp Program and other vital nutrition programs in the farm bill.”
