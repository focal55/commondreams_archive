<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 6 - At a press conference in the U.S. Capitol, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)
today was joined by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Grocery Manufacturers Association
(GMA), the Food Marketing Institute (FMI), the American Frozen Food Institute (AFFI), the
Coalition for a Stronger FDA and FDA Alliance, the Center for Science in the Public Interest
(CSPI), and the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) in calling on the White House to
increase FDA’s food safety resources. Also today, in a letter to President Bush with cosigners
from both sides of the aisle, Senator Durbin urged the President to recognize the importance of
this issue by proposing a significant funding increase for FDA’s Foods Program in the FY09
Budget.<p></p>
“For years, Congress has pointed out that the FDA is understaffed and under funded,” said
Senator Durbin. “Now, the FDA's own science advisors admit the agency is failing at its
mission. The only good news is that these reports may give us the momentum we need to
change. I am calling on the Administration to commit to doubling FDA funding over the next
five years. We simply cannot leave American families vulnerable when it comes to food safety.”
Last week, a subcommittee of the FDA’s Science Board released a pivotal report detailing how
under funding of the FDA is jeopardizing the agency’s ability to protect the food supply.
Specifically, the report found that FDA is woefully under funded and unable to do its job due to
soaring demands on the Agency; and resources that have not increased in proportion to those
demands.<p></p>
“We need comprehensive preventive measures, effective surveillance, and robust authority for
FDA to take action where needed to protect lives,” said Senator Kennedy. “There’s no mystery
to how to improve food safety. The Europeans have a strong system, and so do the Japanese. I
am working with my colleagues on the health committee and throughout the Senate on
comprehensive bipartisan legislation to protect the food supply – and this proposal ought to be
the first order of business for the Senate in the new year.
“The nature of our food supply is evolving more rapidly than ever before, and the food industry
is adapting in order to provide consumers with abundant, safe and affordable food,” said GMA
President and CEO Cal Dooley. “In order to adequately protect the food supply and restore
consumer confidence in our nation’s food safety net, Congress and the Bush Administration must
provide FDA with the resources it needs to modernize the agency and allow it to properly fulfill
its food safety mission.”<p></p>
“Just like we wouldn't send the cavalry to fight a modern war, we should not allow the FDA to
continue to use out-of-date tools to manage a global food supply,” said Caroline Smith DeWaal,
food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “The latest report from the
FDA Science Board says that FDA's food program is in critical condition. The proof of the
report is in the number of food outbreaks and recalls over the last 16 months. Preventing
illnesses and outbreaks takes money. Without it, millions of consumers are at increased risk of
becoming ill from something they eat.”<p></p>
“The FDA continues to receive less and less resources and more and more responsibility,”
said William Hubbard, FDA Coalition spokesperson. “The Institute of Medicine has concluded
FDA needs more funding, the FDA's own advisors now conclude FDA is in critical shape
because of lack of funding, and now we need the Administration and Congress to come to that
same conclusion and provide more resources.”<p></p>
“The capable and dedicated professionals at FDA would certainly benefit from increased funding
for essential food safety programs,” said Tim Hammonds, president and CEO, FMI. “Because of
extensive experience with the rapidly evolving food safety challenges facing our nation, FDA's
leadership can be a valuable resource for helping to decide just how this additional funding can
be best targeted and allocated.”<p></p>
“Consumers expect the FDA to be able to assure that the food on their plates is safe,” said Chris
Waldrop, Director of the Food Policy Institute at Consumer Federation of America. “Without
adequate resources, the FDA is unable to meet those expectations, and consumers are put at
unnecessary risk. We urge Congress and the Administration to significantly increase the FDA’s
funding so that it has the resources it needs to protect our food supply.”<p></p>
“The proposed increase that we seek will assist the FDA in developing new strategies, as well as
continue important work in the areas of regulatory enforcement, monitoring and inspection,
international harmonization, science-based oversight, foreign food safety assessments and
technical assistance, and trade,” said American Frozen Food Institute President and Chief
Executive Officer Leslie G. Sarasin. “These efforts are intended to enable the agency to remain
an effective force in resolving issues bearing on the safety, quality, and labeling of foods and
other products.”<p><b>About GMA</b></p>
