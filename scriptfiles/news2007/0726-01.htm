<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 26 - On the July 24 <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/24/sitroom.02.html" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/24/sitroom.02.html" target="_new">edition</a> of CNN's <i>The Situation Room</i>, host Wolf Blitzer 
interviewed <i>Weekly Standard</i> 

writer Stephen F. Hayes about his recently released book on Vice President Dick 
Cheney, <i><a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061337048/Cheney/index.aspx" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061337048/Cheney/index.aspx
http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061337048/Cheney/index.aspx" target="_new">Cheney: The Untold Story of America's Most Powerful and 
Controversial Vice President</a></i>. During the interview, 
Hayes claimed that Cheney and President Bush "initially ... both thought there was 
a possibility that Saddam Hussein had had some role in the September 11th 
attacks," and that "pretty much everybody thought" Iraq "had weapons of mass 
destruction, and these terrorist groups that were -- in some cases, had 
overlapping relationships with Saddam ... and his intelligence services." Blitzer 
offered no challenge to Hayes' Iraq/Al Qaeda statements, despite the fact that 
Hayes wrote several articles and a <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200406300014" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200406300014" target="_new">book</a> alleging 
connections between Al Qaeda and Iraq that were later discredited, and that 
Hayes' flawed work was touted by Cheney as the "best source of information" 
regarding the alleged connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Indeed, at no point 
during the interview did Blitzer note Hayes' steadfast support of the Bush 
administration's national security policies. 
Nor did CNN identify Hayes 
as a writer for the conservative <i>Weekly 
Standard</i>.</p>

<p>As <i>Media Matters for America</i> <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200707240004?f=h_latest" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200707240004?f=h_latest" target="_new">documented</a>, Hayes has for years offered 
factually inaccurate and misleading support of Cheney and the Bush 
administration's foreign policy, particularly with regard to the Iraq 
war. Most recently, 
Hayes appeared on the 
July 22 broadcast of NBC's <i>Meet the 
Press</i> and claimed that the July 17 release of the <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20070717_release.pdf" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20070717_release.pdf
http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20070717_release.pdf" target="_new">National Intelligence Estimate</a> (NIE) on 
the terrorist threat to the United States "strengthens the basic case that the 
administration has been making that Al Qaeda remains a serious threat," despite 
the fact that the NIE, as <i>The 
New York Times</i> <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/washington/17cnd-terror.html?ex=1342324800&en=20c9cd9ca51a87d4&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/washington/17cnd-terror.html?ex=1342324800&amp;en=20c9cd9ca51a87d4&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss" target="_new">reported</a>, "concludes that the United 
States is losing ground on a number of fronts in the fight against Al Qaeda, and 
describes the terrorist organization as having significantly strengthened over 
the past two years."</p>

<p><i>Media 
Matters</i> also identified 
instances in which Hayes engaged in falsehoods and distortions in defense of 
Cheney and the administration's attempts to link Al Qaeda and 
Iraq. For example, 
on the December 9, 2005, 
<a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10439315/" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10439315/" target="_new">edition</a> of MSNBC's <i>Hardball with Chris Matthews</i>, Hayes 
defended Cheney's December 2001 
claim that 9-11 hijacker 
Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence official in Prague. According to 
Hayes: "If you look at the front page of <i>The 
New York Times</i> in the days surrounding the vice president's claim, 
<i>The New York Times</i> was reporting 
the same thing." But as <i>Media 
Matters</i> <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200512130004" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200512130004" target="_new">noted</a>, even after the <i>Times</i> and numerous other <a href="http:www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0501-05.htm" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0501-05.htm
http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0501-05.htm">news</a> <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.progressiveaustin.org/isikoff.htm" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.progressiveaustin.org/isikoff.htm
http://www.progressiveaustin.org/isikoff.htm" target="_new">outlets</a> subsequently reported in 
May 2002 the FBI and CIA's finding that "<a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E6DA1231F931A35756C0A9649C8B63" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E6DA1231F931A35756C0A9649C8B63
http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E6DA1231F931A35756C0A9649C8B63" target="_new">no evidence</a>" existed to 
substantiate the claim, Cheney continued to raise the possibility of such a 
meeting.</p>

<p>Additionally, in an <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=3378" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=3378" target="_new">article</a> in <i>The Weekly Standard</i>'s November 24, 2003, 
issue, Hayes attributed to "a top secret U.S. government memorandum" -- which 
Hayes identified as a memorandum produced by former Undersecretary of Defense 
Douglas Feith -- the conclusion that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden "had an 
operational relationship." Hayes wrote of the memo: "Much of the evidence is 
detailed, conclusive, and corroborated by multiple sources." In a January 9, 
2004, interview with Denver's <i>Rocky Mountain 
News</i>, Cheney cited Hayes' article, claiming that "[i]t goes through 
and lays out in some detail, based on an assessment that was done by the 
Department of Defense and was forwarded to the Senate Intelligence Committee 
some weeks ago." Cheney added: "That's your best source of information." 
However, following the publication of Hayes' article, the Pentagon released a <a href="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2003/nr20031115-0642.html" title="http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2003/nr20031115-0642.html" target="_blank">statement</a> asserting that "[n]ews reports" 
about the memo "are inaccurate," and that the portion of the memo to which 
Hayes' article referred "was not an analysis of the substantive issue of the 
relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda, and it drew no 
conclusions."</p>

<p>From the July 24 
edition of CNN's <i>The Situation 
Room</i>: </p><blockquote>

<p>BLITZER: 
Because I remember, [Cheney] was the defense secretary during the first Gulf 
War. I was the Pentagon correspondent. And there -- afterwards, for a long time, 
throughout the '90s, he strongly defended that decision to liberate 
Kuwait and then stop -- not 
go all the way to Baghdad to get rid of Saddam 
Hussein.</p>

<p>So what 
changed in his mind, because he and Colin Powell were -- who was chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs, as you remember -- pretty much strongly opposed that throughout 
the '90s?</p>

<p>HAYES: 
You're right. Vice President Cheney gave a speech when he was finishing up his 
term as secretary of defense in 1992 in Seattle in which he walks through the 
reasons, very carefully, very meticulously, why.</p>

<p>BLITZER: 
Because he was criticized for that.</p>

<p>HAYES: He 
was criticized for it. At the time, there were a lot of second-guessers saying 
we should have gone. We should have removed Saddam Hussein 
--</p>

<p>BLITZER: 
Finish the job, yes.</p>

<p>HAYES: -- 
when we had the opportunity. And he was arguing for a limited 
mission.</p>

<p>BLITZER: 
So what changed?</p>

<p>HAYES: I 
think September 11th changed him. The nature of the threat 
--</p>

<p>BLITZER: 
But did he really believe that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis had anything to do 
with 9-11?</p>

<p>HAYES: 
<b>I think initially that, you know, he and the 
president both thought there was a possibility that Saddam Hussein had had some 
role in the September 11th attacks. But, really, beyond that, it was more this 
broad threat of Iraq, on the one hand, a state that he thought -- and pretty 
much everybody thought -- had weapons of mass destruction, and these terrorist 
groups that were, in some cases, had overlapping relationships with Saddam and 
his intelligence -- and his intelligence 
services.</b></p>

<p>BLITZER: 
<b>So it's fair to say he was pretty much 
surprised at all the post-mortems that have done -- that have occurred in more 
recent years, that there was no Saddam connection to 9-11, no weapons of mass 
destruction?</b></p>

<p><b>A 
lot of the stuff that's come out pretty much, I assume, in the conversations you 
had with him, he acknowledged that he was pretty much 
surprised.</b></p>

<p>HAYES: 
<b>Yes. I think he -- you know, he, like 
everybody else, or most everybody else, thought certainly that we'd find 
stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. So I think it's fair to say that that 
was a surprise.</b></p>

<p>BLITZER: 
And does he look back and try to, you know, get some lessons learned from his 
own involvement?</p>

<p>Because 
as you point out in the book, and as others have pointed out, he was deeply 
involved in all the details going into the war and the immediate 
aftermath.</p>

<p>HAYES: 
Yes, he said that to me, actually. I put that exact question to him. And he 
said, you know, one of the lessons here is not to underestimate this kind of an 
undertaking, which is, you know, a tacit admission that they did underestimate, 
in certain respects, what would be needed to keep Iraq 
together.</p>

<p>BLITZER: 
The book is entitled <i>Cheney: The Untold 
Story of America's Most Powerful and 
Controversial Vice President.</i></p>

<p>The 
author, Steve Hayes.</p>
