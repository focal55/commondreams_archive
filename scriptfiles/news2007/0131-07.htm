<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - Today, the Lawyers' Committee 
                            for Civil Rights announces their support for the Deceptive 
                            Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 
                            2007, and applauds the efforts of Senators Barack 
                            Obama and Chuck Schumer who introduced the bill. <br>
                            <br>
                            Forty years after the passage of the Voting Rights 
                            Act, Americans continue to be targets of deceptive 
                            practices and intimidation as they attempt to cast 
                            a ballot. Since 2004, the Lawyers' Committee, the 
                            lead legal organization in the Election Protection 
                            Coalition, has collected reports of deceptive practices 
                            or voter intimidation from more than 30 states. <br>
                            <br>
                            &#147;It is outrageous that in 2007 Americans continue 
                            to be the subject of intimidation and deception as 
                            they attempt to exercise their most fundamental right. 
                            These attempts prevent the will of the voters from 
                            determining election outcomes and undermine the greatness 
                            of our democratic process,&#148; said Barbara R. Arnwine, 
                            Executive Director of the Lawyers' Committee. &#147;This 
                            bill is a critically important step towards ridding 
                            the country of these despicable practices that threaten 
                            the integrity of our election system.&#148; <br>
                            <br>
                            The counsel and experience of the Lawyers' Committee's 
                            National Campaign for Fair Elections and the Election 
                            Protection Coalition were critical to demonstrating 
                            the compelling need for this important bill and for 
                            shaping the most effective response to this essential 
                            challenge. <br>
