<p>WASHINGTON - September 14 - CODEPINK and others will be hosting a going away Gonzales party and
happy hour on Friday outside of the Justice Department. Ever since the
Attorney General called the Geneva Conventions quaint and sanctioned
torture, CODEPINK has been calling for his resignation. Our persistent
and colorful protests became a constant in the hearing rooms and at a
3-month-long vigil outside the Department of Justice. We will be there
to wave goodbye to Gonzo and celebrate his long-awaited departure as
he gives his farewell speech to Justice Department employees. Great
photo opportunities.
<P></P>
<strong>WHEN:</strong> Friday, September 14th 2:30-5:30pm
<P></P>
<strong>WHERE:</strong> 9th and Constitution NW, the front entrance of the Justice Department
<P></P>
"Resignation couldn't happen to a more deserving Attorney General,"
says CODEPINKer Liz Hourican of Arizona, who organized the protests
outside the Justice Department. "For us, today is a date of
celebration."
<P></P>
CODEPINK women and men from around the country continue their
political pilgrimage to Congressional hearings, member offices and
hallways to demand an end to the illegal US military occupation of
Iraq. Each day that Congress does not move to bring our troops home
CODEPINK activists will be on Capitol Hill to hold our elected
officials accountable for not representing the will of the majority of
Americans. CODEPINK now rents a 5 bedroom house blocks from the
Capitol and will continue its presence in Congress until the troops
come home.
