<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 17 -  Today, one day after the District of Columbia announced an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court of the D.C. Circuit’s recent Parker opinion striking down the District’s handgun ban, the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence posted another installment in its online critique exposing the blatant flaws in the Parker decision.&nbsp; Parker remains the only federal appeals court decision in American history to strike down a gun law as a violation of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The critique, “Second Amendment Fantasy: The D.C. Circuit’s Opinion In The Parker Case,” exposes the court’s opinion as contrary to binding Supreme Court precedent, and rife with distortions and misconstructions of authority.&nbsp; “Second Amendment Fantasy” will provide an authoritative, detailed analysis of the court’s decision, and the meaning of the Second Amendment.&nbsp; An overview of the critique, and the first two chapters, are posted on <a href="http://www.gunlawsuits.org">www.gunlawsuits.org</a>.&nbsp; Additional chapters will be posted in coming months.<br>

<br>
On Friday, March 9, 2007, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, by a 2-1 vote, invalidated the District of Columbia’s restrictive handgun law, along with separate provisions of D.C. law requiring that registered firearms be kept unloaded or locked when stored at home.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Departing from the conclusions of nine other federal circuit courts, Judge Laurence Silberman’s majority opinion in Parker v. District of Columbia found that the Second Amendment right is not limited to the possession and use of firearms in connection with service in organized militias, but rather extends to the personal possession of guns for private purposes like self-defense and hunting.&nbsp; On May 8, the D.C. Circuit denied rehearing <em>en banc</em>, with Judges Randolph, Rogers, Tatel and Garland voting to grant rehearing.&nbsp; The District of Columbia has decided to seek an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
The first chapter of the critique, Mangling Miller, explained how the court defied the binding interpretation of the Second Amendment set out almost 70 years ago by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller.&nbsp; The newest chapter, Decision by Eraser, explains how the court, in its zest to find the Second Amendment protects “private purposes,” chose to obliterate the first half of the Amendment and its militia purpose.<p align="center"># # #</p>
