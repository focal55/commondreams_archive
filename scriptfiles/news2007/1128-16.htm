<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 -There is a significant risk that fraudulent polls and other deceptions will be used to challenge the results of Venezuela's referendum, if proposed constitutional reforms are approved this Sunday, according to Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) economist and Co-Director Mark Weisbrot.</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
"The international media has not always exercised due diligence in its reporting on polling data and elections in Venezuela," said Weisbrot, who has authored papers on previous elections there.</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
"This opens up the possibility for the use of fake polling, as was done in the last (2004) referendum, to cast doubt on the results if the proposed constitutional reforms are approved," he said.</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
In 2004, the influential U.S. polling firm Penn, Schoen, and Berland published fake exit polls on the day of the Presidential recall referendum, showing President Hugo Chávez losing by a 59-41 margin.(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote1">1</a></span>) The actual results, which were certified by observer missions from the Organization of American States and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, showed the opposite, with Chávez winning by a margin of 58 to 41 percent.(<a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote2" class="small">2</a>)<br>

</span>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
The fake exit polls were not the only dubious polls that plagued the last referendum. Most of the pre-election polls in 2004 showed the race "too close to call." Although these were conducted by opposition pollsters, most of the international media accepted them in their reporting. As CEPR demonstrated at the time, it is extremely unlikely that a properly conducted poll could have shown a result that was "too close to call."</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
The election's credibility was also attacked by a widely-cited statistical paper(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote3">3</a></span>) purporting to show evidence of fraud. CEPR showed that this analysis was deeply flawed and provided no such evidence; the Carter Center later commissioned an independent panel of statisticians from U.S. universities, which confirmed CEPR's finding and concluded that there was no statistical evidence of fraud.(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote4">4</a></span>)  <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and some Latin American media outlets used this paper and the fake exit polls to claim that the referendum was actually stolen through a clever electronic fraud.(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote5">5</a></span>) <br>

</span>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
On this basis of such analysis and fake exit polls, most of the opposition rejected the results of the 2004 referendum, and went on to boycott the 2005 national elections.</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
In the 2006 Presidential election, Penn, Schoen and Berland once again produced questionable polling data showing the race to be in a " very close" just before the election. Other pollsters, including Zogby International, showed an 18-29 point spread favoring Chávez.(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote6">6</a></span>)&nbsp; According to the <em>Miami Herald</em>, this led to the sudden departure of Doug Schoen – who was responsible for the Venezuela polling – on the eve of the election.(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote7">7</a></span>) Chávez won the presidency by a margin of 63 to 37 percent.</span><br>

<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
"The international media's reporting on the current referendum so far is not encouraging," Weisbrot said. He noted that on November 7th, "almost all of the U.S. and international press reported that pro-Chávez gunmen had fired on a crowd of peaceful protesters returning from a demonstration against the reforms.(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/">8</a></span>)&nbsp; We now know that this is not at all what happened."(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote9">9</a></span>) </span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
</span><br>
<span class="pageIntro">
Weisbrot also noted that the media has given wide coverage to a poll by Datanalisis this week showing a defeat for the proposed reforms.(<span class="small"><a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1372/77/#Footnote10">10</a></span>) The firm's longstanding ties to the opposition, and its serious polling errors in the last referendum, were not mentioned in the press.<br>

While all the details of the incident may never be known, it is clear that media reports describing the repression of peaceful demonstrators were inaccurate and created a powerful false impression.</span>
