<p>NEW YORK  - January 22 - The 
American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for National Security Studies 
today filed three Freedom of Information Act requests seeking the immediate 
release of records related to President Bush&#8217;s asserted authority to search 
Americans&#8217; mail without a warrant. The president claimed this unprecedented 
authority in a "signing statement" attached to a statute that expressly 
prohibits opening First Class mail without a warrant.<BR>
<BR>The groups say there 
are major facts that need to be made public, including whether and how often 
this asserted power has been used, whether people whose mail is searched are 
notified after the fact, and what policies have been put in place to conduct the 
searches.<BR><BR>"No president has the authority to decide on his own what the law 
is," said Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU. "From Pentagon and 
FBI surveillance of peace activists to unchecked NSA wiretapping, the executive 
branch is trampling on the privacy and free speech rights of Americans. The 
public needs to know if the president is undermining the democratic process by 
abusing his power and violating the Constitution."<BR><BR>The Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA) requests were filed today with the United States Postal Service, the 
Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
The requests seek any rules, regulations, policies, procedures, practices, or 
guidance from 2001 to the present concerning warrantless searches of mail 
originating from within the United States. The ACLU and CNSS are specifically 
seeking statistical data and any information on whether the government has 
authorized warrantless searches; who is allowed to conduct these searches; any 
actual or potential violations of policies on warrantless searches; and all 
legal analysis on the constitutionality of warrantless searches.<BR><BR>The "signing 
statement" issued by President Bush accompanied H.R. 6407, the Postal 
Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. The Act reiterated the 30-year-old 
prohibition on opening First Class mail of domestic origin without a warrant. In 
1996, the postal regulations were altered to permit the opening of First Class 
mail without a warrant in narrowly defined cases where the Postal Inspector 
believes there is a credible threat that the package contains dangerous material 
like bombs. Instead of referencing the narrow exception in the postal 
regulations, the president&#8217;s signing statement suggests that he is assuming 
broader authority to open mail without a warrant.<P></P>
<P>"The president appears to be relying on the same legal argument used to 
justify warrantless eavesdropping to claim a new and alarming power to read 
Americans&#8217; mail without a court order," said Brittany Benowitz, a CNSS staff 
attorney.<BR><BR>The groups say that the warrantless searches may violate existing 
law and regulations, as well as circumvent the judicial oversight required by 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Congress enacted FISA in 
response to revelations about widespread political surveillance by the FBI under 
the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover. Following those revelations, Congress 
convened hearings and established a commission to investigate the government&#8217;s 
abuses and explore how best to prevent future excesses. The hearings, chaired by 
Idaho Senator Frank Church, revealed that the FBI had operated a secret 
mail-opening program in which it submitted names of "domestic political radicals 
and black militants" to the CIA for inclusion in its own mail-opening "Watch 
List."<BR><BR>The December 20 "signing statement" came just one year after the 
president revealed the existence of a secret National Security Agency domestic 
electronic surveillance program. Last August, in a landmark case brought by the 
ACLU, a federal district judge in Detroit declared the program unconstitutional. 
Last week, the Justice Department announced that the surveillance program will 
now be subject to review by the FISA court, but the ACLU expressed skepticism 
that the program complies with FISA and the Constitution. A hearing in the case 
is scheduled for January 31 before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. <BR>
