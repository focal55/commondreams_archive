<b><a href="mailto:torke@verizon.net">Ross PourzalL</a></b><br>
An Iranian-American human rights activist, Pourzal is president of the
Campaign Against Sanctions &amp; Military Intervention in Iran. He said
today: "As the Gulf region slides into a cold war, Iran's maneuvers in
the region result from the insecure environment and state of siege that
Washington and London are intent on imposing on Iran. Tehran's capture
of British sailors is more a response to escalation than a provocation.
Judging from my interviews in Iran last month, the government there
enjoys widespread support for its foreign policy." Pourzal lives in
Washington, D.C.<br>

<b><a href="mailto:pbennis@ips-dc.org">Phyllis Bennis</a></b><br>
Bennis, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, comments: "The
U.S. is continuing to ratchet up threats against Iran. The current
standoff in the Gulf between Iran and Britain may well not have been a
deliberate British provocation, beyond the 'normal' provocative nature
of the U.S.-British strategy of boarding and 'inspecting' ships, etc.,
but that doesn't mean it isn't dangerous."<br>
<br>
She adds: "Blair isn't so keen on an attack on Iran; his rhetoric even
after the sailors were captured has been remarkably low-key, and a move
against Iran could threaten his already-shaky political standing. The
Shatt al-Arab waterway is always a difficult navigation point, even
aside from political tensions, and this kind of move has happened
before and blown over in a few days. However, it's likely the Cheney
gang is pushing Britain to escalate, to make this Tonkin Gulf II (the
false claim of a North Vietnamese attack used to justify the Vietnam
war in 1964), though it doesn't appear Blair/Brown are biting yet. But,
once again, having said all THAT, things are very tense and could
easily spin out of control."<br>
