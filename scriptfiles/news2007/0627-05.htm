<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 27 - On Friday, June 29, Michael Moore’s new film, 'Sicko' will premiere across the country. The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA (the national organization for health care consumers), about the film:<br><br>“Whether one agrees or disagrees with Michael Moore, the public interest in his new film demonstrates the growing anxiety that exists throughout the United States about health care costs and coverage. It is for this reason that health care reform has become the top domestic priority for America’s voters.<br><br>“Since the start of the 21st century, health care premiums have soared. They have risen more than six times faster than earnings, thereby making health coverage increasingly unaffordable. Today, more people are uninsured than the combined population of 24 states and the District of Columbia.<br><br>“As a result, health care costs and coverage are now a top source of insecurity and concern for America’s families. More and more people are being priced out of the high-quality health care they used to take for granted.<br><br>
“As we move closer to the election season, it will be up to those who aspire to be our nation’s leaders to address this problem in an effective and high-priority manner.'<br>
