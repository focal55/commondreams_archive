<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 28 - Bay area CODEPINK member collapsed in Lieberman's office after
10 days of an ongoing hunger-strike to gain a meeting with the Senator. Outraged
by Senator Lieberman's comments on CBS on June 15 about wanting to bomb Iran,
CODEPINK member Leslie Angeline, 50, decided to start a hunger strike until she
could meet with the senator. A meeting was scheduled then cancelled by
Lieberman's office, resulting in over 50 members of CODEPINK and Iranian,
Iraqi, Israeli and Jewish communities to converge on the Senator's office. 3 days
later the Senator from Connecticut repeated
his accusations and proposed military attack against Iran. Angeline has been a daily
presence in Lieberman's office and passed out in the presence of staffers
today. She is in transit to GW hospital to be treated for dehydration. There is
still no word from the Senator's staff as to whether she will get a meeting or
not.
