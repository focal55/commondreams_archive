<p>WASHINGTON, DC &mdash; A vacationing President Bush issued an Executive Order directing federal land management agencies to &ldquo;expand and enhance hunting opportunities.&rdquo; While the order does not overturn any conservation laws, it establishes a preference for hunting at the expense of all other activities in the administration of federal lands, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER).
<p>Although the order explicitly covers national forests, wildlife refuges and range lands, it also applies to all federal agencies &ldquo;that have a measurable effect on land management,&rdquo; such as military bases and nuclear weapon reservations. These federal agencies must now &ldquo;evaluate the effect of [their] actions on trends in hunting participation [and] consider the economic and recreational value of hunting in agency actions.&rdquo;<br>

    <br>
  &ldquo;This is political meddling posing as a conservation policy,&rdquo; stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch. &ldquo;This order reads like it was written by a lobbyist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Issued this Friday, August 17, 2007, the order mandates that federal land managers &ndash;</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Manage wildlife and wildlife habitats on public lands in a manner that expands and enhances hunting opportunities, including through the use of hunting in wildlife management&rdquo;;</li>
  <li>Defer to &ldquo;private property rights and State management authority over wildlife resources&rdquo; and</li>

  <li>Foster &ldquo;productive populations of game species and appropriate opportunities for the public to hunt those species.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The President seems to be saying you can never have too many deer and that public lands should be run as a salad bar for trophy animals,&rdquo; Ruch added. &ldquo;It would have made more sense to have Dick Cheney sign this executive order instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The edict does provide that any actions should be &ldquo;consistent with agency missions.&rdquo; Further, it stipulates that the directive &ldquo;does not create any right&hellip;or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States [or] its departments&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This may amount to no more than meaningless pandering to the &lsquo;hook and bullet&rsquo; vote but, if vigorously implemented, has the potential to change what happens on the ground,&rdquo; Ruch concluded, noting that most federal lands except national parks already allow hunting. &ldquo;There appears to be no shortage of hunting opportunities; perhaps the reason for the decline in hunting licenses lies elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The action enshrines an entity called the Sporting Conservation Council, created by outgoing Interior Secretary Gale Norton in 2006, to help develop &ldquo;a comprehensive Recreational Hunting and Wildlife Conservation Plan [setting] forth a 10 year agenda for fulfilling&rdquo; the goals of the Executive Order.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
