<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 - Today, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold listed some 
          of the accomplishments he made on a diverse range of issues in 2006. 
          Despite being in the minority in the Senate in 2006, Feingold was able 
          to make progress on issues including health care, agriculture, national 
          security, and protecting our freedoms.
<p>&#8220;I was pleased to be able to help get a lot done this year 
            on behalf of Wisconsin and the country,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;As 
            an incoming member of the Senate majority in the new Congress, I hope 
            2007 yields even more results.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Feingold&#8217;s 2006 accomplishments include:</p>
          
        <p><em><strong>Protecting U.S. Taxpayer Dollars in Iraq</strong></em> 
          &#8211; Feingold worked with a bipartisan group of Senators to extend 
          the life of the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction 
          (SIGIR). The SIGIR has been successful in providing aggressive oversight 
          over billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars allocated for the reconstruction 
          of Iraq. When members of the House inserted a last minute provision 
          to terminate the office before its job was done, Feingold immediately 
          cosponsored legislation to stop the early termination of the SIGIR. 
          That legislation passed both the Senate and the House.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Keeping our Skies Safe</em></strong> &#8211; The Volunteers 
          for Safe Skies Act, a program that Feingold created at the suggestion 
          of Wisconsinites following 9/11, is finally fully implemented. The program 
          allows first responders traveling by air to anonymously register with 
          the airline to help in the event of an on-board emergency.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Helping our First Responders</em></strong> &#8211; Feingold 
          cosponsored an amendment to the Homeland Security spending bill to increase 
          funding for Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPGs). The final 
          bill included the funding increase for the grants, which help state 
          and local governments develop effective emergency response systems. 
          Feingold also wrote letters in support of grants for fire departments 
          and emergency management services across the state, many of which were 
          awarded funding through FIRE and SAFER Acts grants.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Addressing Terrorist Threat in Africa</em></strong> &#8211; 
          Feingold was successful in including two provisions in the 2007 defense 
          authorization bill to address security concerns in Africa. One provision 
          called on the administration to develop a comprehensive strategy for 
          Somalia, where hard-line extremists and individuals with ties to al 
          Qaeda are gaining power. Feingold also included a provision calling 
          on the Department of Defense (DoD) to study the feasibility of establishing 
          a U.S. military command in Africa to help address emerging threats to 
          our national security there. The DoD announced in December that it was 
          recommending the creation of an Africa Command to the President.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Fighting for Dairy Farmers</em></strong> &#8211; Feingold 
          led the opposition to the Administration&#8217;s proposed tax increase 
          on dairy farmers. Feingold made sure that the Senate&#8217;s budget 
          blueprint did not include expected revenues from the tax.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Helping Wisconsin Veterans</em></strong> &#8211; Feingold 
          continued his efforts to have a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic for 
          veterans built in Northwestern Wisconsin. In late 2005, Feingold personally 
          called Veterans Administration Secretary Nicholson in support of the 
          clinic. In June 2006, the VA announced its approval of a clinic in Northwestern 
          Wisconsin.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Supporting Military Families</em></strong> &#8211; The 
          Senate approved a Feingold amendment to the DoD authorization bill to 
          help relieve some of the burdens put on family members of deployed members 
          of the Armed Forces. Unfortunately, the amendment was deleted by members 
          of the House but Feingold will continue to fight for military families 
          in the next Congress.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Reforming the Army Corps of Engineers</em></strong> &#8211; 
          After years of working to reform the system by which the Army Corps 
          of Engineers chooses and builds projects, Feingold successfully pushed 
          legislation through the Senate requiring independent review of certain 
          expensive corps reform projects in order to save U.S. taxpayer dollars 
          and protect public safety. While the House and Senate could not agree 
          on a final bill, Feingold will continue to push reforms to the broken 
          system in the next Congress.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Protecting and Defending Civil Liberties</em></strong> 
          &#8211; A Feingold amendment requiring the Department of Homeland Security 
          (DHS) to report to Congress on its use and development of data mining 
          technology passed as part of the Senate DHS appropriations bill. This 
          continues Feingold&#8217;s efforts to address privacy concerns related 
          to data mining.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Voting Rights</em></strong> &#8211; Feingold helped enact 
          the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, which 
          reauthorized expiring provisions of the historic Voting Rights Act of 
          1965. The bill was signed into law in July 2006.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Securing Disaster Relief for Wisconsin</em></strong> &#8211; 
          Feingold led efforts with others in the Wisconsin congressional delegation 
          to ask the U.S. Department of Agriculture to declare certain Wisconsin 
          counties as agricultural disaster areas due to drought conditions. Over 
          the summer and fall, several counties received the disaster declaration 
          and became eligible for aid.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Responding to the Health Care Concerns of Wisconsinites</em></strong> 
          &#8211; In Feingold&#8217;s fourteen years of holding open listening 
          sessions in each Wisconsin county every year, health care coverage has 
          been a top issue of concern. In response, Feingold introduced the State 
          Based Health Care Reform Act to break the logjam in Congress over health 
          care and move the country towards universal health care.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Supporting Stem Cell Research</em></strong> &#8211; Feingold 
          cosponsored the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which could open 
          doors to potentially life-saving medical research. The bill passed both 
          houses of the Republican-controlled Congress, but was vetoed by the 
          President. Feingold will continue his efforts to pass legislation to 
          allow stem-cell research.</p>
          
        <p><strong><em>Ensuring that the U.S. Government Buys American</em></strong> 
          &#8211; Feingold was successful in including provisions in the Senate-passed 
          DoD authorization bill that encourage DoD to buy American made goods 
          by requiring it to provide regular information on its purchases of non-American 
          made goods.</p>
