<p>CLEVELAND - March 19 - On the fourth
anniversary of the start of the Iraq War, Congressman and Democratic
Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich has asked his fellow Americans if it
is time to consider impeachment of members of the Bush administration.
<p>    In a three-and-a-half minute video posted Monday on his campaign
website and on YouTube.com, the Ohio Congressman said, "We are in an
interesting condition in this country, where we are told to take
impeachment off the table, and keep on the table a U.S. military attack
against Iran."
<p>    Kucinich was referring to the long-standing insistence of some House
Democrats that impeachment was "off the table" in Congress, and to the
removal last week of a clause in the pending Iraq War appropriations bill
that would have insisted the President come to Congress for approval before
launching any military action against Iran.
 <p>   "This past week, in the Congress of the United States, I noted that the
administration has threatened aggressive war against Iran. This is a
violation of the UN charter. ... It's illegal to threaten aggressive war
against another nation. Iran has no ability to attack us. And they do not
have the intention to attack the United States."
<p>    Kucinich asked people to join him in taking a stand on behalf of peace.
<p>    "We cannot let this administration go any deeper into this journey,
into destroying democratic governance, trashing our Constitution,
forgetting the very purpose of this nation. America was never meant to be a
nation forever on the warpath. It was meant to be a nation which also had
the capacity to 'Promote the General Welfare.' We need to reevaluate the
direction of this administration by looking at its conduct in office, by
determining whether it has faithfully followed the laws of our nation."
  <p>  Kucinich said he was prepared to start the impeachment process.
  <p>  In an address on the House floor last week he warned the administration
that its actions toward Iran "already constitute a case to ask the question
about impeachment."
 <p>   On Monday, he traveled to London to meet with members of the British
Parliament concerned about the war, and to give the keynote address at a
large anti-war rally (http://www.stopwar.org.uk) to be held at Westminster
on Tuesday.
 <p>  In his video, Kucinich asked if others also think it is time to go down
the road to impeachment. Responses to his video can be posted on his
campaign web site: http://www.kucinich.us.

<p> My fellow Americans. We are in an interesting condition in this
country, where we are told to take impeachment off the table, and keep on
the table a U.S. military attack against Iran.
    <p> This really calls for a new thinking. It calls for us to reconsider
very deeply the moment that we're in -- where our Constitution is being
trashed, where international law is being violated, where our hopes and
dreams for the education of our children, for the health of our people, for
housing, for our veterans, are being set aside as we go deeper and deeper
into war.
    <p> We need a whole discussion in America. And with your help, we're about
to have one.
    <p>This past week, in the Congress of the United States, I noted that the
administration has threatened aggressive war against Iran. This is a
violation of the UN charter. Charters are treaties. Article 6 of the
Constitution of the United States says that treaties are the law of our
land, the supreme law of our land.
     <p>It's illegal to threaten aggressive war against another nation. Iran
has no ability to attack us. And they do not have the intention to attack
the United States.
    <p> We are at a moment in human history where we have to make a decision
whether we are going to go deeper into war, or whether we are going to take
a stand on behalf of peace.
    <p> I determined a long time ago to take that stand on behalf of peace. And
I want to enlist you and enroll you in taking that same stand.
    <p> We cannot let this administration go any deeper into this journey, into
destroying democratic governance, trashing our Constitution, forgetting the
very purpose of this nation. America was never meant to be a nation forever
on the warpath. It was meant to be a nation which also had the capacity to
"Promote the General Welfare."
     <p>We need to reevaluate the direction of this administration by looking
at its conduct in office, by determining whether it has faithfully followed
the laws of our nation.
    <p> I'm prepared to start that process. I began this week with a speech on
the floor of the house, which warned the administration that its actions
toward Iran already constitute a case to ask the question about
impeachment.
    <p> So I'm asking you, what do you think?
    <p> Do you think it's time?<!-- #EndEditable -->
