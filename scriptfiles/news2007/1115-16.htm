<p>WASHINGTON - November 15 -On Thursday, November 8th, the Hon. Benjamin Settle issued a preliminary injunction halting any further court martial proceedings of Lt. Ehren Watada and effectively ruling against the Army on virtually every issue in the case.  This injunction not only extends the stay until the conclusion of the habeas corpus proceedings but addresses the specific request for relief from further legal proceedings, stating "the remedy sought by Petitioner, while rare, is appropriate". In response, the Army issued a statement announcing its intent to file briefs in U.S. District Court to try to prevent the injunction from becoming permanent.
 <p></p>
Throughout the country, supporters of Lt. Watada have been joined by individuals and organizations who raise serious questions regarding the Army’s treatment of Lt. Watada – and more specifically, judicial bias and disregard for the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.  We salute Judge Settle’s courage and the clarity of his decision. 
  <p></p>
The judge held that "for several reasons...it is likely that (Lt. Watada) will succeed on the merits of his double jeopardy claim; that he is likely to succeed at demonstrating that the military judge acted “irrationally, irresponsibly, precipitately" in failing to consider feasible alternatives to a mistrial; and that “the same Fifth Amendment protections are in place for military service members as are afforded to civilians.”
  <p></p>
This ruling came after the repeated refusal of the military appeals courts to free Lt. Watada of the burden of a second trial.  Lt. Watada's attorneys have consistently argued that the military should not be allowed a "do-over."  The military judge halted the first trial in the wake of admissions by prosecution witnesses regarding Lt. Watada's fine character and statements that Lt. Watada’s decision not to deploy was an act of conscience.
 <p></p>
Lt. Watada faced court martial and up to 6 years imprisonment for refusing to deploy and for speaking out against a war that he believes is illegal. His first trial in February, 2007, ended in a mistrial, and he has been assigned to desk duty in Ft. Lewis, Washington, while his attorneys filed motions in military court and then in Federal court to prevent the second court martial.
  <p></p>
According to Mike Wong of Veterans for Peace and a member of the National Steering Committee for the Friends and Family of Lt. Watada:  “This is a turning point in the Watada campaign.  To convince the Army to end this, we have to demonstrate that Ehren's support is growing and that the longer they carry on this travesty of justice, the more they will lose.”  And from Cindy Domingo, steering committee member from Seattle:  “We urge the army to do what is right; to not appeal the ruling, to drop all charges, and release Lt. Watada with an honorable discharge.”
 <p></p>
Friends and Family of Lt. Watada assert that vigils and other demonstrations will continue until charges are dropped and Lt. Watada is released from service. They have called for nationwide vigils by supporters of Lt. Watada on the first and third Saturdays of the month, and especially on November 17th, which marks one week since Judge Settle issued his preliminary injunction.. Lt. Watada’s supporters urge the military not to appeal Judge Settle’s ruling and to instead release Lt. Watada with an honorable discharge.  
  <p></p>
The Nov. 14th vigil in Seattle is at Westlake Mall – on 4th Ave. and Pine – from 11 AM to1 PM. Other vigils will be held around the country. For locations and background information go to<a href="http://www.thankyoult.org" target="_new"> www.thankyoult.org</a>.  <!-- #EndEditable -->
