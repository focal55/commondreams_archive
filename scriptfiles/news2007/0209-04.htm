<p>WASHINGTON - February 9 - U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI), Jeff Bingaman 
          (D-NM), and Norm Coleman (R-MN) are working to make sure people currently 
          enrolled in the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) 
          continue to be covered. The bipartisan group of Senators wrote to the 
          Senate Finance Committee urging it to support existing coverage for 
          individuals currently enrolled in the program. As the Senate prepares 
          to reauthorize SCHIP, several committee members are seeking to eliminate 
          a provision that would allow adults to continue receiving health insurance 
          coverage under SCHIP. </p>
          <p>&#8220;SCHIP is critical to the thousands of Wisconsinites enrolled 
            in BadgerCare, Wisconsin&#8217;s program to provide health care coverage 
            for uninsured families,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;Eliminating coverage 
            would hurt tens of thousands of expecting mothers and parents of children 
            enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Minnesota is a state with one of the lowest rates of uninsured 
            people due to our innovative and forward-thinking approaches to health 
            care financing,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;The President&#8217;s 
            budget would restrict state flexibility in the use of Medicaid dollars, 
            which could inadvertently result in more folks losing insurance coverage. 
            As we move forward, I will fight to ensure that Minnesota is not penalized 
            for its effective and efficient use of federal funding.&#8221; </p>
          <p>&#8220;There are nearly 50 million uninsured Americans. About 400,000 
            of them live in New Mexico. The SCHIP program has played an important 
            role in reducing the number of uninsured Americans,&#8221; Bingaman 
            said. &#8220;In my view, we should be taking actions to fix the uninsured 
            problem, not add to it by preventing states from using SCHIP funding 
            to cover parents and other adults.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            Currently, the states that insure adult coverage do so under a federal 
            &#8220;grandfather&#8221; law that primarily extends to low-income 
            adults and parents of children enrolled in SCHIP and Medicaid. There 
            are currently over 640,000 adults enrolled in SCHIP.</p>
          
        <p>The letter, co-signed by 23 Senators, requests that the Senate Finance 
          Committee to maintain two provisions: </p>
          <p>1. Make permanent a provision that allows eleven states to use up 
            to 20% of SCHIP allotments to cover individuals previously enrolled 
            in Medicaid. </p>
          <p>2. Ensure that there is no change in current federal law permitting 
            some states to provide adult coverage under SCHIP. </p>
