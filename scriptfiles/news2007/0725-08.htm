<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 25 - Dennis Rivera, Chair of SEIU Healthcare, the nation’s largest health care union representing over a million nurses, LPNs, doctors, lab technicians, nursing home workers, and home care workers, spoke at a Capitol Hill press conference today along with nearly 30 other labor and health advocacy organizations. <br>
<br>Rivera thanked House Members for taking leadership in fixing the nation’s broken health care system, and urged them to continue their work towards providing health care to the 9 million children who are currently uninsured in the United States. <br><br>SEIU Healthcare supports the full $50 billion funding allocated by the Budget Resolution for the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and supports an increase in the tobacco tax to provide this funding. <br><br>“An increased tobacco tax will not only help SCHIP cover more kids, but also decrease smoking--especially among children. As healthcare workers and providers, we think less smoking and healthier kids is a win-win situation. The tobacco tax provides a clear solution for funding this crucial expansion of care for kids,” says Rivera. <br><br>The 1.9 million member healthcare union also supports funding the families of uninsured children, for which neither the House nor Senate bills provide. <br><br>“The committee's SCHIP package is a good first step. We will continue to work for full funding and urge the Bush Administration to reconsider its veto threat. If $50 billion is worth funding five months of the Iraq war, it's more than worth funding five years of children's health coverage. <br><br>“Everyone should have access to healthcare of the highest quality, and SCHIP has already done that for millions of children. <br><br>“All eyes in America are on the issue of health care now like never before.” <br>
