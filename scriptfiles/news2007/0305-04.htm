<p>ROME - March 5 -- Greenpeace today called on governments 
attending the biannual United Nations fisheries meeting in Rome this 
week to push for the implementation of a global network of fully 
protected marine reserves covering 40% of marine ecosystems as an 
essential way to restore health of global fish-stocks and to protect 
marine ecosystems.

<p>This is a crucial week for Ministers and officials who have gathered 
from around the world for the largest global fisheries meeting in the UN 
calendar. Against a backdrop of drastic declines in global fish stocks 
and with no sign of the threats to marine life diminishing, governments 
must take action this week and commit to overhauling their approach to 
fisheries and oceans management.

<p>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation recently warned 
that 77% of global fish stocks are fully or over exploited . Demand for 
fish is increasing, illegal and unregulated fishing is expanding as 
industrialised fleets move into areas where regulations do not exist or 
are weak, and even in areas that have fisheries regimes operating, 
stocks of commercial species, such as bluefin tuna, are close to collapse.

<p>"It's time to make a radical change to the way our oceans are managed, 
thinking about the whole marine environment, not just a particular 
species" said Greenpeace International campaigner Sari Tolvanen. "Marine 
reserves are the only way to protect and restore the marine environment 
and to allow exploited fish stocks to recover".

<p>Apo Island Marine Reserve is one of the best-known examples of marine 
protection in the Philippines. Studies have shown the benefits of the 
reserve for conservation and for local communities. It has seen a 
seven-fold increase in large predatory reef fish after 11 years of 
protection. Large no-take marine reserves on the high seas would deliver 
the same benefit to commercial fisheries. Putting large areas of ocean 
aside from all extractive uses, such as fishing and mining, can result 
in long lasting and often rapid increases in marine populations, their 
diversity and productivity - of significance to the millions of people 
who depend on sustainable fish resources.

<p>Greenpeace is calling for Regional Fisheries Management Organisations 
and governments to take much stronger action on Illegal, Unregulated and 
Unreported (IUU) fishing, to stamp out pirate fishing and to ensure 
trade in fish products does not result in further depletion of these 
resources. But in the face of such slow progress on IUU fishing, and 
expanding pressure on fish stocks, governments must fundamentally change 
the way they protect life under the sea. Otherwise future generations 
will not enjoy either the beauty or the bounty of our oceans.

<p>"Protection of ocean ecosystems is crucial for the millions of people 
who are dependent on them for their livelihoods, particularly local 
fishers and communities for whom fish provides not just an income, but 
also a source of food," said Sebastien Losada. "The best way to protect 
our ocean resources, both for their intrinsic value but also the value 
they provide to those communities dependent on them, is to create marine 
reserves."
