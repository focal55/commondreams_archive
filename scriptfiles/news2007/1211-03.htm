<p>WASHINGTON - December 11 - Media coverage of the 2008 presidential election identifies immigration as a key issue for the U.S. electorate--even though, according to most polling, it does not rank as a top priority for voters.<br>
<br>
<span class="media_outlet">CNN</span>'s Republican debate on November 28 opened with a full 35 minutes of the debate devoted to the issue of immigration. <span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span> columnist David Broder (<a target="_new" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/14/AR2007111402030.html" title="">11/15/07</a>)  recently referred to "illegal immigration" as one of two major "icebergs ahead for the Democrats" in the upcoming presidential race (ex-President Bill Clinton being the other one). <br>
<br>
Columnist and <span class="media_outlet">CBS</span> correspondent Gloria Borger (<span class="media_outlet">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/opinion/gborger/2007/11/10/dems-immigration-dilemma.html" title="">11/10/07</a>) declared immigration a "killer issue," and that Democratic candidates "had better get started" on a solution: "<span class="media_outlet">Independent</span> voters are unhappy that nothing has been done on the matter, and anyone who wants to be president needs to keep independent voters happy." Borger approvingly quoted Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg, who thinks the time has come for a "welfare moment"--an allusion to Bill Clinton's pledge to "reform" welfare in 1992.  <br>

 <br>
<span class="media_outlet">NPR</span> decided to make immigration one of the three issues of concern of its December 4 Democratic presidential debate. (Iran/Iraq policy and China were the other categories.) The following day's <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span> report on the debate (<a target="_new" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/us/politics/05debate.html?pagewanted=all" title="">12/5/07</a>) was headlined (in the print edition) "Immigration, a Relentless Issue, Confronts Democrats in an Iowa Debate." The paper alleged that the issue of immigration is "a topic looming large both in the Iowa caucuses next month and in the general election."<br>
<br>
That's not what voters have been saying, though.<br>
<br>
The Iraq War still tops the list of priority issues for both Democrats and Republicans. "It's raised twice as often as the next-ranking issue, the economy," according to a recent USA Today/Gallup poll (<a target="_new" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-12-04-poll_N.htm" title="">11/30/07-12/1/07</a>). <br>

<br>
Another recent poll (L.A. Times/<span class="media_outlet">Bloomberg</span>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm" title="">11/30/07-12/3/07</a>) found only 15 percent of Americans ranking immigration as one of the top three issues of concern to them. In fact, noted <span class="media_outlet">L.A. Times</span> columnist Tim Rutten (<a target="_new" href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-rutten1dec01,0,4122002.column" title="">12/1/07</a>), "more than nine out of 10 Americans think something matters more than immigration in this presidential election." <br>
<br>
Even when the question is posed in terms of "illegal immigrants"--a politically loaded phrase--public opinion on undocumented workers is, as it is on most political issues, quite mixed. But "a strong bipartisan majority -- 60 percent -- favors allowing illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes to become citizens if they pay fines, learn English and meet other requirements," according to the most recent L.A. Times/<span class="media_outlet">Bloomberg</span> poll (<span class="media_outlet">L.A. Times</span>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-immigpoll6dec06,1,5649115.story" title="">12/6/07</a>). <br>

 <br>
The polling data suggests that immigration is not at all the "relentless issue" the <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span> makes it out to be. If anything can be described as "relentless" about the issue of immigration, it's the way it has been pushed by the media.<br>
<br>
<span class="media_outlet">CNN</span>'s Lou Dobbs--who has a record of touting inaccurate xenophobic claims and promoting white supremacists on air (see <span class="media_outlet">Extra!</span>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1162" title="">1-2/04</a>; <span class="media_outlet">Intelligence Report</span>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=589" title="">Winter/05</a>)--led into <span class="media_outlet">CNN</span>'s Republican debate (<a target="_new" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0711/28/ldt.01.html" title="">11/28/07</a>) by calling immigration advocates "misguided abject fools" who are  "working to subvert the will of the majority of the people of this country." Given the clear disdain U.S. media are showing for Americans' priorities for the upcoming election, one would think it was not the U.S. electorate but Dobbs himself whose vote was going to determine the 2008 presidential vote. <br>

<br>
Of course, time spent talking about immigration-- which appeals to more conservative voters--is time not spent talking about, say, the economy or the Iraq War. This could very well be smart politics for Republican presidential candidates; as GOP pollster Whit Ayres put it (<span class="media_outlet">USA Today</span>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20071205/1a_lede05_dom.art.htm" title="">12/4/07</a>), "Anything that pushes Iraq farther down the agenda is good news for Republicans." But media shouldn't mistake GOP campaign priorities for evidence of a shift in the public's priorities.
