<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 11 -The nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association today called global warming an "unnatural disaster" for America’s national parks, and called on Congress and the Administration to take action now before the centennial of the park system.</p>
<p>"Global warming is harming our national parks. If our national parks are to survive and thrive into their second century, we must act now. We call on Congress and the Administration to put an action plan in place that will protect our national parks," said&nbsp;National Parks Conservation Association President Tom Kiernan.</p>
<p>The National Parks Conservation Association new report, <a href="/globalwarming" target="_blank">Unnatural Disaster: Global Warming and Our National Parks</a>, recommends federal, state, local, and individual action, warning that if steps are not taken to slow or halt climate change, Yosemite and other western parks will see more wildfires, the Blue Ridge Parkway will see more 'code red' days, and Cape Hatteras’ famous lighthouse will have to be moved again before it washes away.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of curbing the pollutants that contribute to global warming, the Environmental Protection Agency recently took steps that could pave the way for new coal-fired power plants to emit more pollution into our national parks.&nbsp;The National Parks Conservation Association&nbsp;is <a href="http://ga1.org/campaign/EPA_Proposal" target="_blank">urging the agency to abandon the proposal</a>.</p>
<p>"Congress and the Administration should put the brakes on dirty coal-fired power plants and other polluters now," Kiernan added. "We can still protect our national parks from the worst damages if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help parks adapt to changes that are already occurring. If we act now, the next generation of Americans will be able to enjoy the natural and historical treasures protected by our national parks; if we wait too long, more and more of our shared heritage will be lost."</p></i><!-- #EndEditable -->
