<p>WASHINGTON - November 5 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) will offer a privileged resolution on the House floor tomorrow that will bring articles of impeachment against the Vice President, Richard B. Cheney. <strong>Following the introduction of the privileged resolution, Kucinich will hold a news conference in 2456 Rayburn at 3 p.m.
</strong>
<P></P>
“The Vice President is cherry picking intelligence and selectively using facts in a manner that does not portray the complete picture,” Kucinich said.
<P></P>
“The best option to prevent an unnecessary war with Iran is to impeach the Vice President, the lead cheerleader of the war. The Constitution gave Congress the power to impeach. Congress must use its power to restrain the Administration and impeach the Vice President before he prods the United States into another war.”
<P></P>
On April 24, 2007, Kucinich introduced H. Res. 333, the Articles of Impeachment against the Vice President. The first two charges focus on the Vice President’s successful effort to mislead the Congress and American public into a war against Iraq. The last charge focuses upon the Vice President’s determination to again mislead the Congress and American public into a war, this one against Iran.
<P></P>
“H. Res. 333 has been before the House of Representatives for half a year and has 21 cosponsors. At the same time, the Vice President has escalated his belligerence towards Iran. Thus, I believe it is now urgent to move the impeachment resolution,” Kucinich concluded.
<P></P>
The 21 cosponsors of H. Res. 333 are: Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Robert Brady (D-PA), Yvette Clarke (D-NY), Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-MO), Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN), Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA), Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA), Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX), Rep. Henry Johnson (D-GA), Rep. Carolyn Kilpatrick (D-MI), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA), Rep. James Moran (D-VA), Rep. Donald Payne (D-NJ), Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Rep. Edolphus Towns (D-NY), Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Rep. Diane Watson (D-CA), Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) and Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD).
