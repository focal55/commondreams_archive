<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON— Human Rights 
Campaign President Joe Solmonese joined with Reps. 
Barney Frank, D-Mass.; Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc.; 
and Chris Shays, R-Conn., to introduce the bipartisan Employment 
Non-Discrimination Act in the U.S. House of Representatives today. The 
bill would address discrimination in the workplace 
by making it illegal to fire, refuse to hire or refuse to promote an 
employee based on the person’s sexual orientation or gender 
identity.
<p>“We are a nation 
predicated on equality, and over the years, we have embraced an 
increasingly broader and more inclusive vision of what that 
means,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. 
“By passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, our country 
will simply be adding another proud chapter to the amazing American 
story of opportunity.”

<p>The bill would be similar to 
policies that are already in place at America’s most profitable 
companies, with 87 percent of Fortune 500 companies including sexual 
orientation in their non-discrimination policies. In addition, 10 times 
the number of Fortune 500 companies cover gender identity in their 
discrimination policies today compared to 2001. A growing list of major 
companies, currently 20, have joined the Business Coalition for 
Workplace Fairness in support of a federal non-discrimination law. These 
businesses represent the financial, high-tech, food and beverage, 
apparel and insurance industries as well as others.</p>

<p>“Nationwide’s 
equal employment opportunity, non-discrimination and harassment policies 
specifically state that we will not tolerate discrimination or 
harassment of any associate based on sexual orientation or gender 
identity,” saidSteven Keyes, vice president 
for compensation, benefits and human resources policy at Nationwide, a member of the business coalition. 
“Having a corporate culture that embraces diversity improves the 
productivity of our associates, helps the company recruit the best 
talent and makes Nationwide more competitive in the insurance and 
financial services industry.”</p>

<p>>Currently, federal law provides 
legal protection against employment discrimination on the basis of race, 
gender, religion, national origin and disability, but not sexual 
orientation or gender identity. In&nbsp;33 states across 
America,&nbsp;it is still legal to fire someone based on his or her 
sexual orientation, and in 42 states, it is still legal to fire someone 
for being transgender.</p>

<p>Qualified, hardworking 
Americans are denied job opportunities, fired or otherwise discriminated 
against for reasons that have nothing to do with their performance and 
abilities. Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or 
gender identity, whether such orientation or identity is real or 
perceived, denies qualified individuals equal opportunities in the 
workplace. Those who experience this form of discrimination have no 
recourse under current federal law or under the Constitution as it has 
been interpreted by the courts.</p>

<p>Said Rep. Barney Frank, 
D-Mass:</p>

<p>“This is a protection 
against discrimination that has been tried in a number of states, 
beginning in Wisconsin more than 20 years ago, and it has worked 
extremely well. It has caused none of the problems that opponents 
inaccurately claimed it would and it has provided job protection for 
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people who ask simply to be 
allowed do their jobs and be judged on their job 
performance.”</p>

<p>>Said Rep. Deborah Pryce, 
R-Ohio:</p>

<p>“This legislation is 
first and foremost about fairness — about allowing all Americans 
to pursue their right to earn a living. Workplace discrimination of any 
kind is wrong, period — yet, in 33 states, it is legal to fire an 
employee based solely on the basis of his or her sexual 
orientation.”</p>

<p>Said Rep. Tammy Baldwin, 
D-Wisc.:</p>

<p>“Twenty-five years ago, 
my own state of Wisconsin was the first in the nation to add sexual 
orientation to anti-discrimination statutes. Since then, 16 states have 
done the same. We call on Congress now to set a new and higher 
standard.&nbsp;With the support of the House leadership and members of 
both parties, I am hopeful that this Congress will close this loophole 
in existing law and pass a truly comprehensive and inclusive bill to 
outlaw employment discrimination.”</p>

<p>Said Rep. Chris Shays, 
R-Conn.:</p>

<p>“In my judgment, this is 
common-sense legislation. Working men and women should be judged on the 
basis of their performance at work. They should not have to fear being 
fired because of their sexual orientation.”</p>

<p>Said the Rev. Dr. Dennis Wiley 
of Covenant Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.:</p>

<p>“My question for 
you today is, how could you consider not passing this bill if it will help to protect the citizens of 
this country from discrimination and ensure that enjoy the 
right to work, to earn a living, to provide for themselves and their 
families and to realize their full God-given potential. I know something 
about this because, as a black man in America, I have experienced 
firsthand the injustice of being discriminated against not because of 
what I could do, but simply because of who 
I <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">was</font></i><font size="3">. Consequently, I made up my mind a long time ago that I would 
never intentionally oppress others in the manner in which I myself have 
been oppressed.”&nbsp;</p>
