<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 30 - On Thursday May 31, three public interest groups will release the just published Nuclear Disorder or Cooperative Security? U.S. Weapons of Terror, the Global Proliferation Crisis, and Paths to Peace. Speakers at a briefing for Congressional staff members and the media will be authors Dr. John Burroughs and Michael Spies, of the New York-based, Lawyers’ Committee on Nuclear Policy; Jacqueline Cabasso, of the California-based Western States Legal Foundation; and Jennifer Nordstrom, of the New York-based Reaching Critical Will project of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. The panel will be moderated by Phyllis Bennis, of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC.

<P></P>Topics of the briefing include:

<P></P>The state of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (including the U.S.-India nuclear deal) 
<P></P>Iran and the nuclear fuel cycle 
<P></P>U.S. nuclear warhead modernization programs; Complex 2030; and new delivery systems 
<P></P>Recommendations for U.S. nuclear weapons policy 
<P></P>A response to the report of the Hans Blix-led Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission, released one year ago, Nuclear Disorder or Cooperative Security offers analysis and recommendations regarding U.S. policy in relation to the international security framework, nuclear weapons R&D, non-proliferation and disarmament, Iran and the nuclear fuel cycle, climate change and nuclear power, missiles and weapons in space, and demilitarization and redefining security in human terms. The authors are experts in law and policy relating to nuclear weapons, and bring a fresh, critical perspective, informed by many years of experience. They recently returned from a Non-Proliferation Treaty review meeting in Vienna. 

<P></P>Hans Blix, Chairman of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission, says regarding the book: “This assessment of our Final Report and its 60 recommendations is exactly the kind of response we were hoping for. The Report has now been critically reviewed and scrutinized by experts from civil society organizations, adding to its credibility. A very timely and important contribution.” Congresswoman Barbara Lee says: “This book is an important contribution to the effort to rid out planet of weapons of mass destruction, and I encourage my colleagues in Congress to read it.”
