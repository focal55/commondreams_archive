<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission
should use its auction of the valuable 700 MHz spectrum to create
high-speed Internet service that will be a true competitor to broadband
services offered by telephone and cable companies, a group of
public-interest and consumer groups said today.<br><br>In a series of
three filings with the FCC, the six-member Save Our Spectrum coalition
said the Commission should structure the auction of the spectrum, and
the service offered over it, so that the service will be operated in a
non-discriminatory manner, under an open access structure following
auction rules that will allow for greater participation than simply the
incumbents.<br><br>The members of the coalition are: Public Knowledge,
Media Access Project, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America,
New America Foundation and Free Press.<br><br>In the filing on
non-discrimination issues coordinated by Public Knowledge and New
America Foundation, the coalition said the Commission should "establish
a service rule for broadband services operating in the 700 MHz band
that protects the consumer's right to use any equipment, content,
application or service on a non-discriminatory basis without
interference from the network provider." This recommendation would make
certain the landmark 1968 <i>Carterfone</i> decision allowing consumer
to attach devices ranging from fax machines to computers to the
telephone network, and would implement Net Neutrality principles of
non-discrimination.<br><br>The open-access filing, coordinated by
Consumers Union, argued that broadband deployment has advanced in other
countries that allow competitors access to telephone-company networks.
That filing said: "It is imperative that we learn the lessons of the
wireline market and make the appropriate policy corrections in the
launch of the most promising wireless broadband markets. Wireless
broadband has not been a useful 'third pipe' and will not be in the
near future if this spectrum is auctioned to the very same vertically
integrated telephone and cable incumbents that dominate the wireline
market."<br><br>In the proposed auction rules, a filing coordinated by
the Media Access Project, the coalition recommended the Commission
offer the new spectrum at the wholesale level, and should "either
prohibit wireline and large wireless incumbents from bidding, or
require them to bid through structurally separate affiliates." The
Commission should also guard against winners of the spectrum auction do
not keep the spectrum from being used by not constructing new services.<br><br><a href="http://www.freepress.net/docs/pisc700mhzfinalpart1.pdf" target="_new">Click here</a> to download the comments on Net Neutrality.<br>
