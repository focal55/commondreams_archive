<p>NEW YORK - February 6 - Human Rights Watch announced today that seven Iranians are among the <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/02/06/global15273.htm">45 writers from 22 countries</a> who are receiving the prestigious Hellman/Hammett prize, an award that recognizes writers globally who have been victims of political persecution.
&nbsp;</p>

The Iranian recipients of this year’s award are writers and activists whose work and activities have been variously suppressed. Beyond what they themselves have experienced, they represent numerous other writers and journalists whose personal and professional lives have been hampered as a result of repressive government policies governing speech and publications.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>“The past year was a particularly difficult one for Iranian writers who had to work in an ever more restrictive atmosphere of new publishing rules and policies,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “It is important to draw international attention to their achievements under the current repressive policies.”
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Human Rights Watch administers the Hellman/Hammett grant program in recognition of the hardships faced by writers all around the world who have been victims of political persecution. The program is financed by the estate of the American playwright Lillian Hellman, with funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist Dashiell Hammett, both of whom suffered professionally during the anti-communist “witch hunts” of the 1950s.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Since the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the situation for Iranian writers has worsened. Authorities systematically suppress freedom of expression and opinion by closing newspapers and imprisoning journalists and editors. The few independent dailies that remain heavily self-censored. Many writers and intellectuals have left the country, are in prison, or have ceased to criticize the government in their writings. Recently imposed rules of publication have further narrowed the field of acceptable speech.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>This year’s recipients of the Hellman-Hammett grant from Iran are:
&nbsp;<br><ul>
&nbsp;<br><li><b>Ali Ashraf Darvishian</b>, 65, one of Iran’s most prominent and prolific post-revolutionary writers, has published more than 20 books, including fiction, children’s stories and a 20-volume collection of Iranian folk tales.

&nbsp;<br><li><b>Shahram Rafizadeh</b>, 34, investigative journalist and blogger, also writes poetry and literary criticism. During the reform era, Rafizadeh was well known for writing about the role of Iranian intelligence agents in the murder of several writers and intellectuals in 1998. He was detained in September 2004 and was held in solitary confinement for 86 days.
&nbsp;<br><li><b>Roozbeh Mir Ebrahimi</b>, 27, worked as an editor and reporter for a number of reformist dailies that have since been shut down by the government. He investigated several high profile human rights cases, including the murder of a 
&nbsp;<br>Canadian-Iranian photojournalist in 2003. He was detained in September 2004
