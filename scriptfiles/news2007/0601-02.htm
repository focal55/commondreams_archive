<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 1 - In response to Thursday's announcement that the board of Dow Jones &amp; Co. is considering selling the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Free Press Executive Director Josh Silver issued the following statement:<br><br>"There are four broadcast TV networks in this country and three national newspapers: The <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. These seven outlets are the most influential news sources in the nation. They effectively determine what's news and what's not. No single company should own two of them. Period.<br><br>"Putting the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> — which always has maintained strict separation between its newsroom and the editorial page — and Fox News under the same umbrella is bad for journalism and bad for democracy. The fact that no law currently prevents such a merger is a grave policy failure that Congress should address through changes in media ownership rules.<br><br>"In the meantime, Dow Jones and the Bancroft family must decide whether their higher priority is good journalism or greed. Once that line is crossed, there's no going back."
