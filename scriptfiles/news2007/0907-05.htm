 WASHINGTON - September 7 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) called a federal judge’s ruling invalidating National Security Letters as unconstitutional a “great victory for the American people.” This intrusive government tactic was authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act.
<p></p>
“The judge’s ruling invalidating National Security Letters in the PATRIOT Act is a win for the American people,” Kucinich said.
<p></p>
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in New York said the FBI’s use of secret “National Security Letters” to demand e-mail and telephone data from private companies for counterterrorism investigations violates the First Amendment and constitutional provisions on the separation of powers, because the FBI can impose indefinite gag orders on the companies and the courts have little opportunity to review the letters, according to today’s Washington Post.
<p></p>
“History tells us that unchecked powers with little or no oversight will be abused and the citizens will be harmed. The Administration’s record in this area is concrete proof that history repeats itself. It is well-documented that the FBI abused its power by sending thousands of National Security Letters. The Administration’s over-reaching efforts were proven unconstitutional.”
<p></p>
Kucinich—who voted against the original USA PATRIOT Act and every reauthorization since—remains one of the most vocal opponents of its intrusion on Americans’ civil liberties.
<p></p>
“Congress needs to overturn the USA PATRIOT Act and end the Bush Administration’s abuse of power,” Kucinich concluded. <p>&nbsp;<!--<p-->
