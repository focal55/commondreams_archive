<p>(Washington, DC)</i> – As the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) prepare for their annual
spring meetings, to be held at their headquarters in Washington, DC
this weekend, Africa Action today stresses that an immediate priority
of the international financial institutions must be the total
cancellation of Africa’s debt, without economic conditions. The
organization further asserts that these wealthy international creditors
have a long history of illegitimate and corrupt lending in Africa and
that this fact must prompt the cancellation of the continent’s debts
without further delay.
<br>
<br>
Nii Akuetteh, Executive Director of Africa Action, said today, <b>“The
effects of illegitimate lending, from which Africa’s people did not
benefit, continue to reverberate throughout the continent. As countries
are made to deplete their budgets to repay their creditors, education
and other vital social services are robbed of resources and this
historical injustice takes a devastating human toll.”</b>
<br>

<br>
Africa Action maintains that the policies of these international
financial institutions continue to wreak havoc on the countries of the
global South. The organization pointed out that this reality is acute
in Africa, where the outflow of massive debt payments has destabilized
economies and undermined economic development.
<br>
<br>While the role of the IMF in Africa and international debt figure
on the agenda of the spring meetings this weekend, Africa Action notes
that the case of Liberia and its need for debt cancellation is yet to
be decided. To date, the arrears still owed by Liberia have prevented
that country from receiving multilateral cancellation. Africa Action
asserts that these old loans were made to repressive and
non-representative rulers, in a clear illustration of illegitimate
lending, and that Liberia’s new government should not have to repay
such debts.
<br>
<br>
Ann-Louise Colgan, Director of Policy Analysis and Communications at Africa Action, said today, <b>“The
World Bank and IMF have failed to acknowledge their own history of
tainted lending and faulty economic practices, in Liberia and
elsewhere. This has contributed directly to the unwillingness of the
international financial institutions to comprehensively expand debt
cancellation. This biased approach, unless drastically altered, will
continue to prop up an unjust international financial system, in which
Africa’s development is held hostage by its foreign debt.”</b>
<br>
<br>
Marie Clarke Brill, Director of Public Education and Mobilization at Africa Action, said today, <b>“While
the agenda of the spring meetings critically ignores the issue of
illegitimate debt, the global movement to shine a spotlight on this
issue grows at a rapid pace. As efforts around the world ramp up to
expose the failures of the international financial institutions,
creditors will increasingly be held accountable for their destructive
policies.”</b>
<br>
<br>
Africa Action today released a new resource, the <b>Africa Action Statement on Illegitimate Debt</b>,
underscoring the injustice of Africa’s debt burden and defining the
organization’s position and demands. This resource is available here: <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/IllegitimateDebt0407.pdf">http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/IllegitimateDebt0407.pdf</a>.

<br>
<br>
To demonstrate a key example of illegitimate lending, Africa Action recently released a resource entitled <b>“Illegitimate Debt After Decades of Turmoil: The Case of Liberia.”</b>
This document describes the unjust circumstances under which loans were
made to Liberia and the ongoing consequences for economic and human
development. It is available here: <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/docs/LiberiaSpotlight.pdf">http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/docs/LiberiaSpotlight.pdf</a>.
<br>
<br>
Africa Action will co-sponsor an event entitled <b>“Illegitimate Debt in DC and the DRC”</b>
on Saturday, April 14, 2007. This screening and panel discussion will
examine the links between corrupt local lending practices and
illegitimacy in international financial relationships. More details can
be found here: <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/events/index.php">http://www.africaaction.org/events/index.php</a>.
