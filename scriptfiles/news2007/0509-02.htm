<p>LOS ANGELES - May 9 - On Thursday, May 10, 2007, a Los Angeles Superior Court complaint will be filed by indigenous plaintiffs from the Peruvian Amazon against defendants Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy), a Delaware Corporation, and Occidental Peruana, a California corporation, alleging egregious harm caused by Oxy over a 30-year period in the Corrientes River basin of the northeastern Peruvian Amazon during which Oxy contaminated the rivers and the lands of the indigenous Achuar people, causing death and destruction of their traditional way of life.

 

<P></P>The legal action follows an in-depth report released by EarthRights International, Amazon Watch, and Racimos de Ungurahui entitled A Legacy of Harm last week that reveals that the oil giant deliberately ignored industry standards and employed out-of-date practices for 30 years, resulting in severe cadmium and lead poisoning among indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon. The report also finds that Oxy dumped an average of 850,000 barrels per day of toxic oil by-products directly into rivers and streams used by the Achuar for drinking, bathing, washing, and fishing – totaling approximately nine billion barrels during the 30 years of operation. A copy of the report can be viewed online at http://www.earthrights.org/files/Reports/A_Legacy_of_Harm.pdf
