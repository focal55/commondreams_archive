<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 22 - The Central Intelligence 
                  Agency violated its charter for 25 years until revelations of 
                  illegal wiretapping, domestic surveillance, assassination plots, 
                  and human experimentation led to official investigations and 
                  reforms in the 1970s, according to declassified documents posted 
                  today on the Web by the National Security Archive at George 
                  Washington University.</p>
                <p>CIA director Gen. Michael Hayden announced today that the Agency 
                  is declassifying the full 693-page file amassed on CIA's illegal 
                  activities by order of then-CIA director James Schlesinger in 
                  1973--the so-called "family jewels." Only a few dozen 
                  heavily-censored pages of this file have previously been declassified, 
                  although multiple Freedom of Information Act requests have been 
                  filed over the years for the documents. Gen. Hayden called today's 
                  release "a glimpse of a very different time and a very 
                  different Agency."</p>
                <p>"This is the first voluntary CIA declassification of controversial 
                  material since <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F40D17FC35550C768DDDAE0894D0494D81" target="_blank">George 
                  Tenet in 1998 reneged</a> on the 1990s promises of greater openness 
                  at the Agency," commented Thomas Blanton, the Archive's 
                  director.</p>

                <p>Hayden also announced the declassification of some 11,000 pages 
                  of the so-called CAESAR, POLO and ESAU papers--hard-target analyses 
                  of Soviet and Chinese leadership internal politics and Sino-Soviet 
                  relations from 1953-1973, a collection of intelligence on Warsaw 
                  Pact military programs, and hundreds of pages on the A-12 spy 
                  plane.</p>
                <p>The National Security Archive separately obtained (and posted 
                  today) a <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf" target="_new"><strong>six-page 
                  summary</strong></a> of the illegal CIA activities, prepared 
                  by Justice Department lawyers after a CIA briefing in December 
                  1974, and the <strong><a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wh1.pdf" target="_new">memorandum 
                  of conversation</a></strong> when the CIA first briefed President 
                  Gerald Ford on the scandal on January 3, 1975.</p>
                <p>Then-CIA director Schlesinger commissioned the "family 
                  jewels" compilation with a May 9, 1973 directive after 
                  finding out that Watergate burglars E. Howard Hunt and James 
                  McCord (both veteran CIA officers) had cooperation from the 
                  Agency as they carried out "dirty tricks" for President 
                  Nixon. The Schlesinger directive, drafted by deputy director 
                  for operations William Colby, commanded senior CIA officials 
                  to report immediately on any current or past Agency matters 
                  that might fall outside CIA authority. By the end of May, Colby 
                  had been named to succeed Schlesinger as DCI, and his loose-leaf 
                  notebook of memos totaled 693 pages [see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Crusader-Colby-Americas-Secret/dp/0195128478" target="_new">John 
                  Prados, <em>Lost Crusader: The Secret Wars of CIA Director William 
                  Colby</em></a> (Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 259-260.]</p>

                <p>Seymour Hersh broke the story of CIA's illegal domestic operations 
                  with a front page story in the <em>New York Times</em> on December 
                  22, 1974 ("Huge C.I.A. Operation Reported in U.S. Against 
                  Antiwar Forces, Other Dissidents in Nixon Years"), writing 
                  that "a check of the CIA's domestic files ordered last 
                  year… produced evidence of dozens of other illegal activities… 
                  beginning in the nineteen fifties, including break-ins, wiretapping, 
                  and the surreptitious inspection of mail."</p>
                <p>On December 31, 1974, CIA director Colby and the CIA general 
                  counsel John Warner <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf" target="_new"><strong>met 
                  with the deputy attorney general</strong></a>, Lawrence Silberman, 
                  and his associate, James Wilderotter, to brief Justice "in 
                  connection with the recent <em>New York Times</em> articles" 
                  on CIA matters that "presented legal questions." Colby's 
                  list included 18 specifics:</p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>1. Confinement of a Russian defector that "might be 
                    regarded as a violation of the kidnapping laws."<br>

                    and Paul Scott.<br>
                    3. Physical surveillance of muckraker Jack Anderson and his 
                    associates, including current Fox News anchor Britt Hume.<br>
                    4. Physical surveillance of then Washington Post reporter 
                    Michael Getler.<br>
                    5. Break-in at the home of a former CIA employee.<br>
                    6. Break-in at the office of a former defector.<br>
                    7. Warrantless entry into the apartment of a former CIA employee.<br>

                    8. Mail opening from 1953 to 1973 of letters to and from the 
                    Soviet Union.<br>
                    9. Mail opening from 1969 to 1972 of letters to and from China.<br>
                    10. Behavior modification experiments on "unwitting" 
                    U.S. citizens.<br>
                    11. Assassination plots against Castro, Lumumba, and Trujillo 
                    (on the latter, "no active part" but a "faint 
                    connection" to the killers).<br>
                    12. Surveillance of dissident groups between 1967 and 1971.<br>
                    13. Surveillance of a particular Latin American female and 
                    U.S. citizens in Detroit.<br>

                    14. Surveillance of a CIA critic and former officer, Victor 
                    Marchetti.<br>
                    15. Amassing of files on 9,900-plus Americans related to the 
                    antiwar movement.<br>
                    16. Polygraph experiments with the San Mateo, California, 
                    sheriff.<br>
                    17. Fake CIA identification documents that might violate state 
                    laws.<br>
                    18. Testing of electronic equipment on US telephone circuits.<br>

                <p>Ten days after the appearance of Hersh's <em>New York Times</em> 
                  story, DCI William Colby tells President Ford how his predecessor 
                  James Schlesinger (then serving as Secretary of Defense) ordered 
                  CIA staffers to compile the "skeletons" in the Agency's 
                  closet, such as surveillance of student radicals, illegal wiretaps, 
                  assassination plots, and the three year confinement of a Soviet 
                  defector, Yuri Nosenko.</p>

                <p>On New Years' eve, 1974, DCI Colby met with Justice Department 
                  officials, including Deputy Attorney General Lawrence H. Silberman, 
                  to give them a full briefing of the "skeletons."</p>

                  3</a>: Kissinger's Reaction<br>
                  Memorandum of Conversation between President Ford and Secretary 
                  of State/National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, 4 January 
                  1975</strong><br>

                <p>An apoplectic Kissinger argues that the unspilling of CIA secrets 
                  is "worse than the days of McCarthyism" when the Wisconsin 
                  Senator went after the State Department. Kissinger had met with 
                  former DCI Richard Helms who told him that "these stories 
                  are just the tip of the iceberg," citing as one example 
                  Robert F. Kennedy's role in assassination planning. Ford wondered 
                  whether to fire Colby, but Kissinger advised him to wait until 
                  after the investigations were complete when he could "put 
                  in someone of towering integrity." The "Blue Ribbon" 
                  announcement refers to the creation of a commission chaired 
                  by then-vice president Nelson A. Rockefeller.</p>

                <p>Cabinet and sub-cabinet level officials led by Kissinger discuss 
                  ways and means to protect information sought by ongoing Senate 
                  (Church Committee) and House (Pike Committee) investigations 
                  of intelligence community abuses during the first decades of 
                  the Cold War. Worried about the foreign governments that have 
                  cooperated with U.S. intelligence agencies, Kissinger wants 
                  to "demonstrate to foreign countries that we aren't too 
                  dangerous to cooperate with because of leaks."</p>
