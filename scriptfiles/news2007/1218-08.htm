<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 18 -- The Massachusetts Department of Education 
(DOE) has agreed to drop its appeal of a lower state court’s ruling that DOE 
officials violated the First Amendment when they coerced education conference 
organizers into cancelling the keynote speech of Alfie Kohn, a well-known critic 
of high stakes exams like the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System 
(MCAS) testing program. In dropping the appeal, the DOE issued a statement 
acknowledging that a former DOE official “violated the First Amendment rights of 
Alfie Kohn to be heard and to communicate information and of people to hear and 
receive information, at a conference in western Massachusetts in 2001.” The DOE 
said, “The DOE’s position is that vigorous debate about education issues is 
healthy and welcome.”</p>

<p>Commenting on the end of the long-running lawsuit, Kohn said 
he was “hopeful that DOE’s newfound commitment to open discussion of education 
policies means that it will never again attempt to silence those who disagree 
with its policies – and that it will be open to considering the substantial 
evidence that indicates the MCAS testing program is doing more harm than 
good.” </p>
<p>Michael Rader, an attorney at Wolf Greenfield &amp; Sacks, 
counsel in the case with the ACLU of Massachusetts, said he was encouraged that 
the DOE had acknowledged its mistakes:&nbsp;“I am pleased that the Department of 
Education decided to drop the appeal and accept the essence of the court’s 
verdict that the DOE had violated the fundamental constitutional rights of 
parents, teachers and community members as well as Mr. Kohn.” </p>
<p>In May 2007, Judge Hiller Zobel issued a decree against the 
DOE and ordered the department to pay $155,000 in fees and costs to the 
plaintiffs’ lawyers. The right to receive information is protected by the First 
Amendment, and Judge Zobel found that right was also violated by the coerced 
cancellation of Kohn’s speech.&nbsp;The DOE filed a notice of its intent to 
appeal the ruling to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, but later elected to drop 
that appeal. </p>
<p>The original case was filed by the ACLU of Massachusetts and 
cooperating attorneys Rader and Michael Albert at the law firm of Wolf, 
Greenfield &amp; Sacks, P.C. on behalf of Kohn, Leslie Edinson, a 
Springfield public school principal, 
David Sprague, a school counselor, and parent Jan Shotwell, who had planned to 
attend Kohn’s keynote speech.&nbsp;ACLU of Massachusetts attorneys Bill Newman 
and Sarah Wunsch were co-counsel on the case.
