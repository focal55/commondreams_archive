<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 13 - Today, Free Press launched <a href="http://www.freetheiphone.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">FreetheiPhone.org</a> -- a
campaign demanding an open, competitive wireless Internet for
everyone. Apple's iPhone -- locked into AT&amp;T's slow, closed
network -- is a bellweather for the future of mobile Internet.
Bad policies have created an unhealthy wireless industry where
companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon are gatekeepers over the mobile
Internet -- with the power to block competition and chain
devices to their slow-speed networks.

</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.freetheiphone.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">FreetheiPhone.org</a>
campaign aims to change all of that. In coming weeks, the
campaign will urge Americans to demand that the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and Congress give them the
freedom to use all Internet devices on any wireless network in a
marketplace that offers true competition, services and consumer
choice. 

</p><p>"This issue goes well beyond the iPhone. It's
about a dysfunctional wireless system that stifles innovation
and competition across the country," said <b>Timothy Karr</b>,
Free Press campaign director. "We need real open access, which
opens networks for innovation and wholesale markets for
competition. Until we have this, the iPhone -- and other
innovative gadgets like it -- will never reach full potential." 

</p><p><a href="http://www.freetheiphone.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">FreetheiPhone.org</a> is
demanding wireless freedom based on three core principles: the
freedom for consumers to use whatever device they want on any
network; the freedom to choose among providers in a competitive
wholesale marketplace; and the freedom for consumers to access
any content or services they want through their devices.

Free Press, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8hxJ73320M" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">explaining
wireless freedom</a> 

</p><p>During the hearing of the House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and the Internet -- dubbed the "iPhone
hearing" -- members from both sides of the aisle called for a
new wireless system, where wholesalers could compete and new
applications and devices could be connected regardless of
carrier. Chairman Markey (D-Mass.) opened the hearing by saying
that the iPhone "highlights both the promise and the problems
with the wireless industry today."

</p><p>Rep. "Chip" Pickering (R-Miss.) echoed the
chairman's remarks, calling for more openness in the
marketplace, "Openness is creating interoperability for devices
so that you can use a device, whether it's an iPhone or another
device, with whatever function you choose. If you want to go to
a Wi-Fi or WiMax spot and use it, or if you want to have the
access to other networks, you can do so. That's openness in
wholesale."

</p><p>The government is about to auction off valuable
public airwaves that could provide millions of Americans with
better wireless Internet access. More than a quarter-million
Americans have called upon the FCC and Congress to open up these
airwaves to new competitors. Earlier this week, FCC Chairman
Kevin Martin circulated a proposal calling for this spectrum to
be open to all devices -- a move that would still close the
network to wholesale competition.

</p><p>"What Chairman Martin is proposing isn't true
open access, and it won't create the broadband competition we
need," said <b>S. Derek Turner</b>, research director at Free
Press. "Martin's plan to unlock devices still leaves us with the
same few companies that are trying to undercut competition, and
whose broken promises on broadband deployment and innovation
have left us with a slow, expensive network and a vast digital
divide."
