<p>WASHINGTON - September 19 - A British polling agency has determined that more than one million Iraqi citizens have died as a result of the Iraq war. This report follows survey results released last fall by Lancet, the prestigious medical magazine which gave a conservative estimate of 650,000 deaths. Opinion Research Business found that the death rate in Iraq increased by 1.2 million people since the U.S.-led invasion began in 2003.

“When you consider that this war was based on lies, when you consider that Iraq did not attack the United States, that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, and that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, it is an urgent matter of national morality to determine what the appropriate response is,” said Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH).
<P></P>
“It is time for us to start talking about the legal responsibility of President Bush, Vice President Cheney and all the other war architects who built a case for the war based on lies.
<P></P>
“The very essence of America’s credibility in the world is at stake. Our highest elected officials should be held accountable for actions that resulted in the deaths of more than a million innocent people, particularly when those deaths were based on demonstrable lies.
<P></P>
“It is very important that we start to ask serious questions about accountability. Just as no individual has the right to take another individual’s life, no nation has the right to kill innocent people in another nation. No leader of the United States--in the name of the United States--should be permitted to wage aggressive war with impunity.
<P></P>
“I am preparing a resolution that requests the House meet in the Committee of the Whole to investigate the matter of civilian causalities as well as U.S. troop casualties that have occurred in Iraq. The resolution will recount that the war was based on lies.  It will ask the House to consider action, including possibly preferring criminal charges against individuals who in the Administrative conduct of office were directly responsible for the war and the consequent loss of life.
<P></P>
“A grave injustice has been done to the people of Iraq and the people of the United States. More than one million lives have been lost. Families have been destroyed. Social networks have been ripped apart. We have had many soldiers killed and injured. This must be acknowledged.
<P></P>
“On a deeper level, the inquiry I am proposing relates to who we are as Americans and what we stand for. I refuse to believe that the American people—people of intelligence and good heart will not want to see justice done. There must be a measure of justice brought forward so that this deep stain on American history is removed,” Kucinich concluded.  “We must seek the truth, wherever it leads.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
