<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Washington, DC — Federal climate, weather and marine
scientists will be subject to new restrictions as to what they can say
to the media or in public, according to agency documents released today
by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). Under
rules posted last week, these federal scientists must obtain agency
pre-approval to speak or write, whether on or off-duty, concerning any
scientific topic deemed “of official interest.”</p>
<p>On March 29, 2007, the Commerce Department posted a new
administrative order governing “Public Communications.” This new order
covers the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
which includes the National Weather Service and the National Marine
Fisheries Service. Commerce’s new order will become effective in 45
days and would repeal a more liberal “open science” policy adopted by
NOAA on February 14, 2006.</p>
<p>Although couched in rhetoric about the need for “broad and open
dissemination of research results [and] open exchange of scientific
ideas,” the new order forbids agency scientists from communicating any
relevant information, even if prepared and delivered on their own time
as private citizens, which has not been approved by the official
chain-of-command:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any “fundamental research communication” must “before the
communication occurs” be submitted to and approved by the designated
“head of the operating unit.” While the directive states that approval
may not be withheld “based on policy, budget, or management
implications of the research,” it does not define these terms and
limits any appeal to within Commerce;</li>
  <li>National Weather
Service employees are allowed only “as part of their routine
responsibilities to communicate information about the weather to the
public”; and</li>
  <li>Scientists must give the Commerce Department
at least two weeks “advance notice” of any written, oral or audiovisual
presentation prepared on their own time if it “is a matter of official
interest to the Department because it relates to Department programs,
policies or operations.” </li>

</ul>
<p>“This ridiculous gag order ignores the First Amendment and
disrespects the world-renowned professionals who work within Commerce
agencies,” stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch. “Under this
policy, National Weather Service scientists can only give out name,
rank, serial number and the temperature.”</p>
<p>The agency rejected a more open policy adopted last year by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The new policy
also was rushed to print despite an ongoing Commerce Office of
Inspector General review of communication policies that was undertaken
at congressional request. </p>
<p>While claiming to provide clarity, the new Commerce order gives
conflicting directives, on one hand telling scientists that if unsure
whether a conclusion has been officially approved “then the researcher
must make clear that he or she is representing his or her individual
conclusion.” Yet, another part of the order states non-official
communications “may not take place or be prepared during working
hours.” This conflict means that every scientist who answers an
unexpected question at a conference puts his or her career at risk by
giving an honest answer.<br>
