<p>CALIFORNIA - JUNE 4 - The 40/60 Campaign for Freedom and Return will converge at Cong. Nancy Pelosi’s office Tuesday, June 5, to commemorate 40 years since the beginning of the 1967 Six-Day War, which began the continued occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip. The rally will commence a year of events, leading to May 2008, which marks 60 years since the mass expulsion of approximately 750,000 Palestinians, indiscriminate massacres and the razing of 531 Palestinian villages to create the state of Israel. Today, almost sixty years after their forced expulsion, 7 million Palestinian refugees remain in exile. 
 
<P></P>The 40/60 campaign for freedom and return began as an initiative by civil society, in occupied Palestinian territories, and within Israel (see: http://www.badil. org/call- en.htm). We are the local coalition of a global movement, calling for an end to the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. The Campaign calls for a settlement to the conflict based on the right of Palestinians to achieve their human rights and a solution which complies with United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 and Security Council 242. 
 
<P></P>The Occupation continues to be the cause of severe economic deprivation and hardship for the Palestinian community, the devastation of its land and the destruction of its livelihood. Hundreds of thousands have been continuously displaced both within Israel and inside the occupied Palestinian territories. Millions of children have grown up and continue to live under military occupation subjected to daily injustice. 
 
<P></P>We also urge Cong. Pelosi to voice strong opposition to the bill due on the House floor in early June, by war hawk Tom Lantos, designed to congratulate Israel for 40 years of Occupation, and celebrate the Six-Day War! 
 
<P></P>All refugees and displaced persons have the right to return to their homes and repossess their properties. These rights are affirmed in international law and United Nations resolutions. All that is needed is a political will, and an effective response to protect and take action towards these measures.
 
<P></P>Please Join Us!
<P></P>WHEN:  Tuesday, June 5th at 3pm 
<P></P>WHERE: Cong., Nancy Pelosi's office, Federal Building - 450 Golden Gate, SFWHO:  Coalition of Bay Area groups, Arab and Palestinian- Americans, including Palestinian survivors of the wars of 1948 and 1967.
