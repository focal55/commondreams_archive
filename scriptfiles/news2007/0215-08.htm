<p>WASHINGTON - February 15 - The American Civil Liberties Union today condemned a vote in 
the South Dakota House of Representatives approving legislation aimed at banning 
almost all abortions in that state.&nbsp; The legislation comes on the heels of 
a statewide election last November that repealed a similar ban at the polls. 
<P>&#8220;This ban is yet another unconstitutional attack on reproductive health 
care,&#8221; said Jennifer Ring, Executive Director of the ACLU of the Dakotas.&nbsp; 
&#8220;The legislature should concentrate its efforts on preventing unintended 
pregnancies and providing services for women who want to bear their children 
rather than deciding that women cannot be trusted to make this most intimate of 
decisions.&#8221; </P>
<P>In November 2006, the voters repealed a ban that would have outlawed nearly 
all abortions in the state &#8211; South Dakotans voted 56 to 44 percent against the 
measure.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s legislation would once again force voters to consider a 
ban on nearly all abortions in the state.&nbsp; Like last year&#8217;s measure, 
today&#8217;s ban poses a danger to the health and safety of women in the state, the 
ACLU said.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;South Dakotans made their voices heard last fall &#8211; families, not 
politicians, should make these very personal health care decisions,&#8221; said Louise 
Melling, Director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.&nbsp; &#8220;What will it 
take to stop lawmakers from playing politics with women&#8217;s health?&#8221;</P>
<P>Today&#8217;s legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 45 to 
25.</P>
<P>According to recent research, South Dakota is failing when it comes to 
protecting access to reproductive health care.&nbsp; In a recent report by the 
Guttmacher Institute, South Dakota ranked 44th in the nation in its efforts to 
help women avoid unintended pregnancy.</P>
