<p>WASHINGTON - December 11 - Four former US soldiers and Veterans For Peace members, met Thursday, Dec. 6, 2007 with the Ambassador of Syria, Dr. Imad Moustapha, in an effort to advance good relations between the people of our two nations.
<P></P>
"Having seen war close-up, I and many members of Veterans For Peace believe that all diplomatic solutions should be exhausted in dealing with global conflicts and differences before resorting to war" said Frank Houde, Chairman of VFP International Liaison. Since the Bush administration has proven unwilling or incapable of using meaningful diplomacy, it is our responsibility as citizens to explore diplomatic alternatives to war.
<P></P>

Dr. Imad Moustapha, said that Syria is not an enemy of the United States and will continue to work for serious dialogue with the current administration to resolve issues diplomatically and civilly.

<P></P>
The Veterans For Peace delegation met the Ambassador as a first step in people-to-people diplomacy, and to discuss a forthcoming VFP Delegation to Syria. "Bridges of peace must be built on strong foundations, built from the solid rock of the people of one nation to the solid rock of the people of another nation," said Ellen Barfield a VFP Board of Directors member and VFP United Nations Delegate.     

<P></P>
In the hour-long meeting, the group also discussed the Iraq refugee crisis, the need for all governments to respect human rights, torture, extraordinary rendition and Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights.

<P></P>
The most pressing concern centered around the approximately four million Iraqi refugees currently in exile with 1.9 million living in Syria. The need for immediate and adequate relief from the United States and the world community is considered essential to mitigate this humanitarian crisis.

<em>Veterans For Peace is a national organization founded in 1985.  It is comprised of member across the country organized in chapters or as at-large members and supported by a national office in St. Louis, MO.  There is a convention each year attended by our members, families and supporters from across the nation.  Members receive periodic VFP publications. The organization includes men and women veterans of all eras and duty stations spanning the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), World War II, the Korean, Vietnam, Gulf and current Iraq wars as well as other conflicts cold or hot.  Our collective experience tells us wars are easy to start and hard to stop and that those hurt are often the innocent.  Thus, other means of problem solving are necessary. Veterans For Peace is an official Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) represented at the UN.</em><!-- #EndEditable -->
