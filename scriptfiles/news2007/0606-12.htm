<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 6 - Today’s vote to deny Florida 
Power &amp; Light’s application to build a massive pulverized coal plant in the 
heart of the Everglades ecosystem puts the “public” back in the name Public 
Service Commission, 
and Florida’s consumers and 
environment are the winners.
<p class="MsoNormal">Governor Crist, CFO Sink and 
other state leaders deserve credit for putting global warming and clean energy 
at the top of Florida’s policy agenda, as this was clearly a major factor in 
today’s decision.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Florida is in the crosshairs of global climate change 
impacts, and with 
this decision, the PSC has taken one big finger off the 
trigger.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, this decision will reassure taxpayers that 
the billions we are spending to restore the Everglades will not be undermined by 
allowing a huge new source of pollution in this treasured 
wilderness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This coal plant was the wrong technology, at the wrong 
time, in the wrong place.&nbsp; 
The Florida Public Service Commission’s unanimous vote to deny Florida Power &amp; 
Light’s proposal to build a massive, polluting coal-fired power plant in the 
Everglades represents a huge victory for Florida’s 
environment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Today’s decision should send 
a clear signal to other Florida utilities proposing new coal plants that state 
policy-makers are charting a new course for Florida energy policy.&nbsp; 
We have cheaper, faster and much cleaner ways to meet Florida’s 
energy needs than building more coal plants.&nbsp; A focus on efficiency, 
conservation and renewable energy sources would entirely displace the need for 
any new coal plants, including the Everglades Coal Plant.”</p>
