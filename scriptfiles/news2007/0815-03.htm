<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 15 -  “In a victory for consumers last week, Tyson Foods, Inc., the nation’s largest red meat producer, quietly informed the House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce that it will phase out the deceptive and potentially unsafe practice of enhancing meat coloring by treatment with carbon monoxide.<br><br>“By creating a red color typically associated with freshness, carbon monoxide makes meat appear fresher than it is. Because we all rely on color when choosing fresh meat for our families, carbon monoxide treatment could deceive consumers into buying spoiled meat that looks fresh and safe. <br><br>“While Tysons should be commended for responding to the 78 percent of Americans who believe that the practice is deceptive, it is outrageous that the two federal agencies charged with protecting consumers and food safety have failed to act. It is ridiculous that congressional committees and individual corporations are doing what the Food &amp; Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture have the authority and the responsibility to do: take carbon monoxide treated meat off grocery store shelves.”</p><br>
