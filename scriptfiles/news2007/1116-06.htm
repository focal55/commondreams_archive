<p>WASHINGTON - November 16 -  Friends of the Earth Action (FoE Action; <a href="http://www.foeaction.org" target="_new">www.foeaction.org</a>), today released a new radio ad to run in Iowa called, "Clinton Fix or Ditch." The ad challenges Senator Hillary Clinton to join John Edwards in taking a firm stand against billions in special interest giveaways to polluting industries included the Lieberman-Warner global warming bill being considered by the U.S. Senate.

</p>
<p>
"As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Clinton has the opportunity to take a firm stance against the more than $750 billion in giveaways to global warming polluters currently included in the Lieberman-Warner bill," said Brent Blackwelder, president of FoE Action. "As our ad states, 'John Edwards has already taken a courageous stand against the bill and the special interests backing it.' Senator Clinton should join him and the growing movement against this deeply flawed bill by fixing or ditching it."
</p><p>
The release of the ad comes in advance of the League of Conservation Voters' (LCV) Presidential Forum taking place on Saturday in Los Angeles. Both Clinton and Edwards will be appearing at the forum to discuss global warming and energy issues.
</p><p>
"At tomorrow's forum, we urge Senator Clinton to let voters know exactly where she stands on the massive giveaways to corporate polluters currently included in the Lieberman-Warner bill. Whether this bill advances out of committee may hinge on her vote, which gives her the ability to force improvements. Anyone who wants to be president should show leadership on this crucial issue," said Blackwelder.
</p><p>
The bill is likely to be considered in committee on December 5.
</p><p>
FoE Action became the first national environmental group to endorse a candidate for president when it endorsed John Edwards on October 14. In making its endorsement, FoE Action noted that he has led the way among the field of candidates running for president on the preeminent environmental issue of the day -- global warming.
</p><p>
Earlier this month, Edwards announced his opposition to the current version of the global warming legislation introduced by Senators Joe Lieberman and John Warner. In detailing his opposition to the bill, Edwards said, "The critical question is simple: are we going to do everything climate science says is needed to save our planet? The Lieberman-Warner bill says no. Worst of all, it gives away pollution permits to industry for free -- a massive corporate windfall -- instead of doing what is right and selling them so that we can use these resources to invest in clean energy research and help regular families go green."
</p><p>
Friends of the Earth Action was founded in 1969 by David Brower, and for decades has been at the forefront of efforts to create a more healthy and just world.  FoE Action and its sister organization, Friends of the Earth have more than 100,000 members and supporters in the United States.
