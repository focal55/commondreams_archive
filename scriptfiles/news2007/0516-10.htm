<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 -Population Action International has released a short film that demonstrates, in heartbreaking detail, the grave consequences of the United States’ abstinence-only approach to HIV prevention in Africa.  It examines the impact, on real people, of U.S. policies that withhold vital information about condom use and other forms of prevention, placing people around the world at greater risk of contracting HIV.  
 
<P></P>The documentary has recently been screened before the United States Congress as well as parliaments in several European countries.  It will shortly be shown in New York, San Francisco and Ottawa.  
 

<P></P>The nine-minute documentary is available online at <a href="http://www.populationaction.org/multimedia/video/index.htm" target="_new">http://www.populationaction.org/multimedia/video/index.htm</a>.  

 
<P></P>Rosemarie Muganda-Onyando, a sexual and reproductive health expert based in Nairobi who appears in the film, is in the U.S. advocating on behalf of a more comprehensive approach to HIV prevention.  Muganda-Onyando is available for interviews.
