<p>SAN FRANCISCO - May 8 - 			Rainforest Action Network (RAN) had tempered praise for Citi’s announcement today that it will invest $50 billion over the next ten years to address global climate change. The pressure group renewed its call on Citi and the rest of the financial industry to stop funding new coal development and other projects that contribute to the global climate crisis. RAN’s analysis showed that $50 billion was insufficient to undo the damage being done by Citi’s investments in coal-fired power plants and other carbon-intensive energy sources. <br><br>“Fifty billion dollars to fight climate change is impressive, until one realizes that Citi actually invests far more in some of the world’s most polluting industries,” said Michael Brune, RAN’s executive director. “It’s a little like Citi is using its left hand to clean up a mess made by its right. The reality is that Citi cannot credibly claim any leadership on climate change until it stops contributing greatly to the problem and phases out its massive investments in dirty energy. &nbsp;<br><br>According to data provider Thomson Financial, Citi was the top arranger of corporate financing for the power and oil and natural-gas sectors in 2006, controlling 10 percent of the $272 billion power-lending market and 8.7 percent of the $310 billion oil and natural-gas lending market. <br><br>Many banks, including Citi, have been under increasing criticism over their investments in new coal-fired power plants, which emit more greenhouse gases than any other source of electricity.&nbsp; In mid-April, RAN organized protests nationwide targeting several of the world’s biggest financial institutions challenging them to adopt the Hansen plan, named after NASA’s noted climatologist Dr. James Hansen, who has called for a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants. The series of actions coincided with Step it Up 2007!, the largest national day of action to stop global warming in U.S. history.<br><br>“The bulk of a bank’s impact on climate is through its investments, so for Citi to become credible on climate change, they need to do more than just fund clean energy, they also need to stop financing dirty energy,” said Rebecca Tarbotton, RAN’s Global Finance campaign director. “Citi continues to be a leading funder of dirty coal-fired power plants, which are responsible for 40% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions”<br><br>In January, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) asserted as “unequivocal” the evidence that human activity is the source of climate change. This week, the IPCC issued a new report noting that, though low carbon ways of generating energy and heat and powering transport are already available, without the introduction of policies that put these solutions into practice, greenhouse gas emissions will increase by between 25 and 90 percent over the next 20 years.<br><br>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.dirtymoney.org" target="_new">www.dirtymoney.org</a>.<!-- #EndEditable -->
