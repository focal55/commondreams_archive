<p> WASHINGTON - May 2 – Following reports of civilians killed in weekend clashes between US forces and the Taliban, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today called on the US military to fully and transparently investigate the tragic incidents.
 
<P></P>On April 27th and 29th, US forces engaged with Taliban fighters in and around Herat using ground and air strikes.  Afghan and UN investigators have reportedly counted about 50 civilian dead in those clashes including women and children. However, according to Pentagon spokesman Colonel Gary Keck, the US military has not opened any formal investigations into these incidents. 
 
<P></P>"With every civilian life lost, the Afghan people get more angry,” said Sarah Holewinski, CIVIC’s executive director. “The US military has a stake in avoiding that kind of resentment. They must now investigate incidents of civilian death following combat operations – and they should ensure the Afghan people see them do it.” 
 
<P></P>CIVIC today said U.S. collateral damage assessments after combat should be standard operating procedure and that investigations into civilian death are appropriate and necessary to earn the support of the Afghan people.  Whenever possible the Afghan government should be allowed to participate in investigations, particularly given President Karzai’s stated concern about the recent increase in civilian casualties.  
 
<P></P>"US forces have to do more than combat their foe on the battlefield,” said Holewinski. "They’ve also got to combat the perception among many Afghans that they don’t care when innocent people suffer after the smoke has cleared.” 
 
<P></P>CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and aided by the warring parties involved. Founded by the late Marla Ruzicka, a passionate humanitarian killed by a suicide bomb in Baghdad while advocating for war victims, CIVIC works toward smart, compassionate policies for civilians caught in the crossfire of conflict.
