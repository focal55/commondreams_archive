<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 11 -<font face="Verdana" size="2">With
General Petraeus claiming significant progress in Iraq, United for
Peace and Justice, the largest national coalition of peace
organizations with some 1,400 member groups, deplores his misleading
and cynical report to Congress. The "surge" of U.S. forces in Iraq has
not led to security, stability or peace. In fact, this past summer was
the deadliest since the war began in 2003. General Petraeus'
recommendation to withdraw one Marine unit this month and a bridge
combat team sometime in December comes nowhere near ending the U.S.
military engagement in Iraq.</font>

the ground in Iraq that contrasts sharply with the comments from
General Petraeus, which barely mention the impact the U.S. war and
occupation has on the lives of the people of Iraq.

<p><font id="role_document" color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><font size="2"><font face="verdana" size="2">Leslie
Cagan, National Coordinator of UFPJ, says, "We feel it is essential to
provide a true picture of what the shattered lives of the 25 million
Iraqis look like today. For four years now we have been hearing the
same false claims that the U.S. is making important gains, but they
have never been true. Prepared by Phyllis Bennis and Erik Leaver,
researchers at the Institute for Policy Studies, <strong><em>Iraq: The People's Report</em></strong>, takes an honest look at what this war has cost the people in Iraq and our communities here in the U.S."</font></font></font></p>

  <ul><font id="role_document" color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><font size="2">
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two
million Iraqis have fled the war to seek hard-to-find refuge in
neighboring countries, and an additional two million Iraqis have been
forced by war fueled violence to flee their homes and remain displaced
and homeless inside Iraq.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
Iraqis have electricity for only about five hours a day, clean water
remains scarce for most and unobtainable for many, and Iraq's oil
production remains a fraction of what it was before war. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Occupation,
war and violence have so decimated the Iraqi economy that unemployment
has reached up to 40% and higher, and underemployment an additional 10%
or more.</font></li></font></font></ul>
  <p><font id="role_document" color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><font size="2"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
spite of the appalling conditions that most Iraqis now find themselves
living in, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are trying to
convince Congress that the situation is improving. "We hope that
Congress will remember that these small improvements in a horrific
situation have cost U.S. taxpayers over $480 billion so far, with no
end in sight," remarked Sue Udry, Legislative Coordinator of United for
Peace and Justice. "That is $480 billion that we could not spend here
at home to rebuild the Gulf Coast, improve education or healthcare and
more."

  <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><font id="role_document" color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><font size="2"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
failure of the Iraq War has also meant a huge cost to our democracy at
home. We have paid an enormous price: in the deaths and shattered minds
and bodies of our young soldiers; in the threats to an economy ravaged
by billion-dollar bills to pay for an illegal war; in the destruction
of so much of our infrastructure, security and social fabric because of
human and financial resources diverted to Iraq; and in the shredding of
our Constitution and civil rights as fear becomes a weapon in the hands
of the Bush administration aimed at Congress, the courts and the people
of this country.

  <p><font id="role_document" color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><font size="2"><font face="Verdana" size="2">United
for Peace and Justice has been working throughout the summer to
pressure members of Congress to take a firm stand against the White
House. "General Petraeus' testimony today illustrates once again the
urgency of congressional action," observed Leslie Cagan, UFPJ's
National Coordinator. "Congress has the constitutional right and moral
obligation to use the power of the purse to force a complete withdrawal
from Iraq. The people of this country are looking to them to take
leadership in this effort."</font></font></font></p>

Udry, UFPJ's Legislative Coordinator, said, "In the weeks ahead, the
pressure on Congress to rein in the White House will accelerate. The
public knows this policy is a failure and wants a rapid change of
course."</font></font></font></p><font id="role_document" color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2"><font size="2"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The full report from United for Peace and Justice is available for download in two formats: <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/downloads/peoplesreport.pdf" target="_new">http://www.unitedforpeace.org/downloads/peoplesreport.pdf</a>
