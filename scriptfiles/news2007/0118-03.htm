<p>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands  - January 18 -  A summary of ‘Global reaction against genetic engineering in 2006’, released by Greenpeace today, provides solid evidence that resistance to genetically engineered crops continues to grow, amongst farmers, consumers and governments. The Greenpeace summary was released just hours before the expected release of an annual report by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a think-tank supported by the agrochemical industry.

<p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-family: Arial;">“There
is irrefutable evidence (1) that governments, farmers and consumers throughout
the world recognise that GE is unreliable, unviable or downright dangerous,”
said Jeremy Tager, campaigner for Greenpeace International, “Market reaction to
the recent rice contamination scandal was of near epidemic proportions; some
countries are banning GE altogether. Romania, for instance, which had 85,000
hectares planted with GE soy in 2005, will drop to zero this year, in keeping
with the new government policy banning the cultivation of GE soy.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
most significant demonstration of GE rejection was the rapid, widespread
aftermath of Bayer’s LLRICE601 contamination scandal. In August 2006, the US
government announced that significant amounts of US long grain rice were found
to be contaminated with an unapproved genetically engineered variety,
LLRICE601; the news elicited strong reactions from rice farmers and processors,
as well as governments worldwide:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
All India Rice Exporters’ Association formally requested that the Indian
government prohibit field trials of GE rice in basmati rice-growing states. Rice
farmers in India burnt down GE-rice test plots that could potentially
contaminate their own fields.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rakesh
Tikait, national spokesperson for the Bharathiya Kisan Union, (BKU) one of the
largest farmers’ groups in India, was straightforward in his condemnation of
GE, saying, “The threat to farmers’ livelihoods in India is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examples of Bt cotton failures from across
the country show that this technology is unsafe for humans and the environment,
and that it can neither be controlled nor regulated. We consider the threat
serious enough to warrant the destruction of test fields of GE rice to stop its
introduction and protect ourselves.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chip
Struckmeyer, a rice farmer from California, agreed,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“US rice producers took a big hit financially when rice was found
to be contaminated with unapproved varieties. It’s clear our customers don’t
want genetically engineered rice. Why on earth would we plant it?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-family: Arial;">“ISAAA
might claim that genetic engineering has been a success, with consistent
increases in global acreage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
global reaction to the Bayer rice contamination scandal of 2006 provides a
sharp contrast to the rosy picture they’re painting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is overwhelmingly clear that the GE industry will not be able
to convince consumers to eat GE rice, wheat, aubergine, or anything else. With
governments unwilling to allow it, farmers unwilling to grow it and consumers
unwilling to buy it, it is amply clear that genetic engineering has no place in
our future,” concluded Tager.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
