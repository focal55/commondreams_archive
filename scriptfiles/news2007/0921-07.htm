<p> WASHINGTON - September 21 - A group of residents and housing advocates from the Gulf Coast are gearing up for a “Week of Action” when they travel to Washington, D.C. this week to push Congress to address the many remaining housing needs in the Gulf Coast region and discuss legislative and funding solutions. The group includes about 36 residents and advocates from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas.
<p></p>
Nearly two years after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, tens of thousands of people remain displaced. The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) has worked closely with Gulf Coast residents and local and national organizations on the housing crisis since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.
<p></p>
“The shockingly slow pace of rebuilding damaged homes has been well-documented,” Sheila Crowley, president of NLIHC, said. “Replacement of housing that was lost is even slower. There are bills pending in Congress now that will speed the repair and redevelopment of federally-assisted housing on the Gulf Coast, untangle some of the federal rules that are impeding recovery, add new housing resources to the recovery effort and codify the transition of disaster housing assistance from FEMA to HUD. It’s time for Congress to make good on the promises that national leaders have made to the people of the Gulf Coast.”
<p></p>
Residents and advocates will attend the Senate Banking Committee’s hearing on Tuesday on legislation to assist in providing affordable housing to those affected by the 2005 hurricanes, S. 1668, the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act of 2007. James Perry, president of the Louisiana Housing Alliance and executive director of the New Orleans Fair Housing Alliance, will testify on behalf of NLIHC.
<p></p>
On Thursday, 34 national and Gulf Coast housing and anti-poverty advocacy groups will sponsor a Congressional briefing to discuss the need for funding for housing recovery in the Gulf Coast states.

<b>The Facts:</b><br>
* Hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaged 1 million homes in four states; <br>
* 300,000 homes were destroyed.       <br>
* Nearly three-quarters (71%) of the homes that were destroyed were affordable to low income families before the storm.

      <br>       
* Due to the slow pace of rebuilding, two years later, at least 106,000 mostly low income families remain displaced.

      <br>       
* Some 31,000 families are still receiving FEMA rent assistance.
      <br>       
* Another 11,500 families who received HUD housing assistance prior to the storm are still getting disaster housing aid through HUD.

      <br>       
* 65,000 families still reside in FEMA issued travel trailers and manufactured homes; <br>
* 15,000 live in trailer camps with the remainder in trailers on their own property.

      <br>       
* As many as 75,000 additional displaced households may have been cut off from FEMA rent assistance by mistake or wrongful action by FEMA.
