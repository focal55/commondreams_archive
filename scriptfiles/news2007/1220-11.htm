<p>WASHINGTON - December 20 - This morning, Santa Claus (in the person of noted constitutional lawyer Bill Goodman) drove his sleigh to the White House to deliver thousands of copies of the U.S. Constitution to President Bush.  <br>
<br>
Americans from all over the country – more than 37,000 of them – asked that a copy of the Constitution be delivered to the President in their name and cordially requested that he make time in his busy schedule to read it.<br>

<br>
<em>"While I was going over the list of who's been naughty and nice," </em><strong>Mr. Claus</strong> said, as he prepared for his visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, <em>"I heard from many people who feel the President hasn't been doing a very good job of upholding his oath to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution."  </em><br>
<br>
Responding to an urgent request from the Center for Constitutional Rights, Claus stepped in to bring messages from Americans who felt the President might need a refresher course in the Constitution. Citizens want to remind President Bush that the Constitution forbids torture and spying on Americans without a warrant, requires that prisoners get a fair hearing of the charges against them before a real court and makes the government's treaty obligations, such the Geneva Conventions, the law of the land. <br>
<br>
<em>"These Constitutions will make great holiday reading," </em><strong>Claus</strong> continued. <em>"I want to be sure that the President has plenty of time to look at them before he decides on his New Year's resolutions." </em><br>

<br>
The complete text of the letter that accompanies the Constitutions is available <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/383/t/4089/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=822" target="_new">here</a>.<br>
</p>	<p><em>The Center for Constitutional Rights is dedicated to advancing and protecting the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Founded in 1966 by attorneys who represented civil rights movements in the South, CCR is a non-profit legal and educational organization committed to the creative use of law as a positive force for social change.</em>
