NEW MEXICO - September 10 -Today the University of New Mexico’s Graduate & Professional Student
Association Council passed a resolution asking the US Congress to end
the US occupation of Iraq.  Citing concern for the wellbeing of US
military service persons and the exorbitant costs of the war, the
resolution calls for providing comprehensive health and higher
educational assistance to returning troops.


<P></P>
The purpose of the resolution is to call attention to local student and
community needs that are not being fully met due to the allocation of
needed funds to the US military engagement in Iraq.


<P></P>
“The billions of dollars being squandered in Iraq could be much better
spent making campus safer and more family friendly, and providing health
care and affordable housing to students,” said GPSA President Joseph J.
García.  Noting the lack of diversity among the ranks of graduate and
professional students, Mr. García said New Mexican’s tax money, instead
of funding war, should “go towards more financial aid for aspiring
graduate students from traditionally excluded backgrounds.”


<P></P>
Lending their support of the resolution at the meeting were State
Senator Gerald Ortiz y Pino and City Councilor Isaac Benton.  They spoke
of the necessity for students and citizens to be heard on important
issues, and described their efforts to express opposition to the US
occupation of Iraq at the state legislature and city council.

<P></P>

The GPSA council is composed of graduate student representatives from
departments across UNM—including the schools of law and medicine.

<P></P>

The GPSA Council will now send copies of the resolution to New Mexico’s
congressional delegation, the Albuquerque City Council, the UNM Board of
Regents, and the President of the United States of America.
