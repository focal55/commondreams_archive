<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 25 - The Government Accountability Project (GAP) applauds the Senate Armed Services Committee for approving an amendment offered by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) to enhance whistleblower protections for employees of Department of Defense (DoD) contractors. The Committee approved the whistleblower protections by voice vote as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, S. 567, which authorizes a half-trillion dollars for Defense Department programs.   <br>
<br>“The committee made a wise strategic investment by approving these protections for contract employees,” stated GAP Legislative Representative Adam Miles. “The employees of major defense contractors working on multi-million dollar programs need to know they will be protected for exposing corruption. The McCaskill amendment accomplishes this goal and will help bring accountability back into the DoD contracting process.”<br><br>	The cornerstone of the amendment allows contract employees to pursue a jury trial in federal district court if they do not receive a timely administrative ruling from the Secretary of Defense after bringing a reprisal allegation to an Inspector General. This is consistent with rights already available to Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission contract employees.  <br><br>“Jury trials for cases of whistleblower retaliation are a whistleblower’s only genuine opportunity for a fair day in court – with justice decided by the taxpayers the employee is trying to defend,” stated GAP Legal Director Tom Devine. “Sen. McCaskill is demonstrating how new blood in the Senate can mean breakthroughs both for defense contractor whistleblowers, and an end to taxpayer-supported blank checks for corrupt contractors like Halliburton.”<br><br>Highlights of the amendment include:<br><br>•	Protecting DoD contract employees for disclosing a broader scope of misconduct than under current law, including misconduct that threatens public safety or national security, as well as gross waste and mismanagement of tax dollars.  <br><br>•	Modernizing the legal burdens of proof for reprisal investigations so they are consistent with every major whistleblower law passed since 1989.  <br><br>•	Extending protected communication channels to government officials responsible for contract oversight.<br><br>•	Requiring that employees working on contracts over $5 million be notified of their rights and protections. <br><br>•	Holding contractors accountable by withholding award payments on large contracts from contractors that retaliate against whistleblowers.<br>	<br>On March 13, the House of Representatives passed breakthrough whistleblower rights legislation, H.R. 985, the “Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act.” The Bush administration threatened to veto the legislation, which includes similar protections for contractor employees.   <br><br>Miles added, “The McCaskill amendment provides a precedent for Senate support of similar reforms passed already in the House this year – with a veto-proof majority. Congress heard and respected the voices from hundreds of public servants at Washington Whistleblower Week.”<br><br><br>
