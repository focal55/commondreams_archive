<p>WASHINGTON - September 12 - <i>Media Matters for 
America</i> today released "Black and White and Re(a)d All Over: The 
Conservative Advantage in Syndicated Op-Ed Columns," a comprehensive and 
unprecedented analysis of nationally syndicated columnists from nearly 1,400 
newspapers or 96 percent of English-language U.S. daily newspapers. Because of the 
time, labor, and difficulty involved in gathering such a wide scope of detailed 
information about America's newspapers, no one has ever 
before determined exactly where syndicated columnists are 
published. The report shows that conservative syndicated columnists 
are carried in far more newspapers, with much greater audience reach than their 
progressive counterparts, giving them a distinct advantage in the marketplace of 
ideas.</p>

<p><b>Among the report's key 
findings:</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Conservative Syndicated Columnists 
Dominate Daily Newspapers --</b> Sixty percent of the nation's newspapers print more 
conservative syndicated columnists every week than progressive syndicated 
columnists. Only 20 percent run more progressives than conservatives, while the 
remaining 20 percent are evenly balanced. </li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Conservative Syndicated Columnists 
Reach Millions More Than Progressives --</b> In a given week, nationally syndicated conservative 
columnists are published in more than 153 million newspapers. Progressive 
columnists, on the other hand, are published in 125 million newspapers. 
</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Top Syndicated Columnists Are Mostly 
Conservative --</b> The 
top-10 list of columnists, sorted by the number of papers in which they are 
carried or by the total circulation of the papers in which they are published, 
includes five conservatives, two centrists, and only three progressives. 
</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>In Region After Region, Conservative 
Syndicated Columnists Enjoy Advantage --</b> In eight of the nine regions into which the U.S. Census 
divides the country, conservative syndicated columnists reach more readers than 
progressive syndicated columnists in any given week. Only in the Middle Atlantic 
region (which includes New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) do progressive columnists reach 
more readers each week. </li></ul>

<p><b>"Together these results 
prove what many have suspected for years -- that our opinion pages are 
consistently skewed to the right, allowing conservatives a disproportionate 
advantage in shaping public opinion,</b>" said David Brock, President and CEO of <i>Media Matters</i>. "<b>The integrity of our nation's newspapers is at stake 
when the debate of today's pressing issues is dominated entirely by one side of 
the argument</b>," Brock 
said. 
</p>

<p>About the Report and <i>Media Matters for America</i></p>

<p><i>Media Matters</i> 
amassed information 
on 201 nationally syndicated columnists published by nearly every daily 
newspaper in the country. Contacting each paper individually to ask which 
syndicated columnists are published, we obtained information from 1377 
newspapers, or 96 percent of all English-language daily newspapers in the 
United 
States.</p>

<p>This study is unparalleled in its scope and 
level of detail. Despite the enormous influence of America's op-ed pages, no one has 
ever before determined where syndicated columnists are specifically published. 
Previous examinations of syndicated columnists relied on data provided by the 
syndicates themselves, while <i>Media 
Matters</i> contacted each and every English-language daily newspapers to 
ensure the highest level of accuracy. </p>

<p><i>Media Matters</i> 
is a 
not-for-profit, progressive research and information center dedicated to 
comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative 
misinformation in the U.S. 
media.</p>
