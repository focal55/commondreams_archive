WASHINGTON - September 10 -  In the wake of recent intense fighting in the North Kivu province between government forces and fighters loyal to renegade general Laurent Nkunda, Amnesty International today accused the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the international community of failing the people of eastern DRC.  
<P></P>
"Despite peace agreements, landmark national elections, and the continued deployment of more than 17,000 U.N. peacekeepers, the people of the Kivus have known no end to the conflict that has blighted their lives for more than a decade," said Erwin van der Borght, director of Amnesty International's Africa Program.
<P></P>
The organization warned of growing danger that this violence could develop into a renewal of mass ethnic killings and other serious human rights abuses. Amnesty International is receiving reports from those fleeing the fighting of rape and killing of civilians. Recruitment and use of children by armed groups in the Kivus has continued.
<P></P>
Fighting between the DRC army and Laurent Nkunda's forces has been ongoing for more than a week in the Masisi and Rutshuru territories of North Kivu. A fragile cease-fire has been negotiated but may not hold. More than 40,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in recent days, adding to the more than 200,000 displaced by insecurity in the province since the beginning of the year.
<P></P>
"The U.S. government, and the United Nations particularly must do their part to end the current human rights crisis in North Kivu. While U.N. members states and the Security Council must maintain and fund the clearly essential presence of MONUC (Mission of the United Nations in the DRC) in eastern DRC, members of Congress should work to pass the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2007 (S.1175)," said Lynn Fredriksson, Advocacy Director for Amnesty International USA. "The U.S. administration also should pick up efforts to advance judicial and security sector reform throughout the DRC, while pressing Presidents Kabila and Kigame to do everything in their power to prevent further human rights violations against civilians in the area."
<P></P>
Amnesty International calls on all forces involved in the fighting to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, cease attacking civilians, and allow humanitarian access to all civilians caught in the violence. MONUC should prioritize protection of civilians over providing support to Congolese government military operations.
<P></P>
The organization also called on the Rwandan government to act immediately to stop the recruitment on its territory of individuals, including children, as fighters for Laurent Nkunda's forces, and to comply with the U.N. arms embargo by ensuring that no military equipment crosses its border into the DRC.
<P></P>
"Reports that the Rwandan government is, at the very least, conniving in the supply of manpower, arms and ammunition to an alleged war criminal like Laurent Nkunda are deeply worrying," said van der Borght.
<P></P>
Amnesty International believes that the continued violence in eastern DRC stems directly from failure by the government and international community to tackle entrenched impunity for human rights related crimes.  
<P></P>
"An international warrant for the arrest of Laurent Nkunda was issued nearly two years ago -- if it had been acted on, we might not be seeing the terrible violations we are seeing today," said van der Borght. "There must now be clear international, DRC and Rwandan government commitment and collaboration to bring him to justice."
<P></P>
"The DRC government has rewarded other alleged war criminals with senior command positions in its army. There can be little confidence that the government army will ever be capable of protecting civilians professionally and impartially as long as no action is taken to remove these individuals from their positions and bring them to justice. The international community, which is providing considerable financial and technical assistance to the country's security sector reform program, should be insisting on this."
<P></P>
Background
<P></P>
Laurent Nkunda, a former senior RCD-Goma officer, is accused of having committed war crimes including in Kisangani in 2002 and Bukavu in 2004. He is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the DRC government in September 2005. The UN has accused him of breaking the arms embargo on DRC. To date, no DRC government or UN operation has been initiated to arrest him. He has been able to move freely in parts of North Kivu province, and Rwanda.
<P></P>
Laurent Nkunda claims that his forces are protecting the province’s ethnic Tutsi population from attacks by the Rwandan insurgent armed group FDLR (Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda). He accuses the DRC government of making insufficient efforts to dislodge the FDLR from eastern DRC. The FDLR has also been responsible for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the DRC. <!-- #EndEditable -->
