<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is cosponsoring 
          an effort to strengthen the United States&#8217; military and reconstruction 
          efforts in Afghanistan. The resolution, introduced by Senator John Kerry 
          (D-MA), also calls on the President to not redeploy any U.S. troops 
          from Afghanistan to Iraq. In late 2006, Feingold, a fourteen-year member 
          of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a similar measure 
          calling for strengthening our efforts in Afghanistan to defeat a resurgent 
          Taliban.</p>
          <p>&#8220;While the Administration moves forward with its escalation 
            plans for Iraq, it has failed to address deteriorating security conditions 
            in Afghanistan.&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;We should not be reducing 
            our forces in Afghanistan. Instead, we should be strengthening our 
            efforts to defeat a resurgent Taliban &#8211; the same movement that 
            harbored and supported the terrorist elements that attacked our country 
            on 9/11.&#8221;</p>
          <p>The resolution also calls for the U.S. to work with international 
            partners and the government of Afghanistan to supply the necessary 
            resources to eradicate the Taliban and terrorist organizations in 
            Afghanistan. Feingold&#8217;s 2006 resolution was introduced after 
            calls from General James Jones, NATO commander and Commander of European 
            Command, for more troops for Afghanistan and more sustained support 
            from the international community.</p>
          <p>&#8220;When Afghanistan becomes a second priority or, as a senior 
            military officer recently put it, an &#8220;economy of force&#8221; 
            operation, it offers a sobering example of this Administration&#8217;s 
            misguided approach to the global fight against terrorist networks,&#8221; 
            Feingold said. &#8220;Because of the Administration&#8217;s Iraq-centric 
            foreign policies, we have neglected situations around the world with 
            a direct impact on our national security, in Afghanistan, Somalia 
            and other countries.&#8221; </p>
