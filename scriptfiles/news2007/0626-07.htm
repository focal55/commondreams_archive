<p>California/Georgia - JUNE 26 - Over 200 immigrant and refugee rights activists and community members will converge on Atlanta, GA to debate, dialogue and work towards a shared agenda for deep justice with thousands of other participants at the first-ever U.S. Social Forum (USSF). At the USSF, being held June 27 through July 1, 2007, immigrant rights groups will also continue demanding just and fair immigration reforms, calling on Congress to stop Senate bill 1639 now being debated.

<P></P>They will participate in the march and opening ceremonies on Wednesday, June 27 at 2 pm EST.

<P></P>Members of the Immigrants Rights Caucus, convened by the National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, will carry out community meetings, marches, dialogues, workshops and other activities during the USSF.

<P></P>In addition, they will hold a media conference on Thursday, June 28, 9:30 a.m. EST in Atlanta, at the Immigrant Rights Tent, near the registration table.

<P></P>The media conference will address the hotly-debated immigration reform bill before the Senate and other concerns being expressed by immigrant and refugee communities during the Social Forum.

<P></P>The Immigrant Rights Caucus, along with allies and partners in social, economic, racial and environmental justice movements at the U.S. Social Forum, will be directing their fire to stop the repressive immigration bill being debated in the U.S. Senate. The Immigrant Rights Caucus proposes reforms and other actions that protect and expand the rights of the foreign-born and redirect resources to address the root causes of involuntary migration, including political and economic instability and conflicts resulting from "free" trade and other neoliberal policies.

<P></P>The U.S. Social Forum is the first-ever major grassroots gathering of communities of color, immigrant and refugee communities, social, racial, environmental and economic justice groups, environmentalists, human rights advocates, LGBTQ rights, women, youth and Indigenous peoples.

<P></P>Consistent with the progressive "World Social Forum" process, participants will shape their discussions and proposals on building a better and more just world without war, poverty, racism and repression and in solidarity with the struggles of people internationally for social and economic justice and freedom from tyranny.
