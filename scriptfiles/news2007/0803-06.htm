<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 3 - Following reports that a judge overruled the Bush Administration’s 
wiretapping procedures, the American Civil Liberties Union today slammed the 
White House for attempting to rush new domestic spying legislation through 
Congress this week.&nbsp; The alleged 
ruling by a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge against a “basket 
warrant” led the administration to begin fiercely lobbying Congress to make 
sweeping changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) before 
Congress recesses. </p>
<p>"A campaign of fear and misinformation has 
spread on Capitol Hill that needs to be stopped," said Anthony D. Romero, 
Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union.&nbsp; "When a judge rules against the 
government, we shouldn't just rush to change the law.&nbsp; We can't allow an administration that breaks the laws to simply 
bully lawmakers into rewriting them.&nbsp; 

Congress must stop caving in and start standing up to this 
administration."</p>
<p>For months, the Bush 
administration has been shopping its proposed FISA changes around Congress.&nbsp; Director of National Intelligence, Mike 
McConnell, has been heavily involved in the lobbying for gutting FISA. Late last 
night, Senators Christopher Bond (R-MO) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY) introduced 
legislation that is very similar to the administration’s proposal.&nbsp; The senators’ bill would permit the 
wiretapping of Americans without warrants and without judicial review.&nbsp; Its proposed changes are sweeping.&nbsp; As long as the National Security Agency 
targets someone overseas, whether that person is sending or receiving 
information via the phone or email, the communications of Americans on the other 
end will be caught up in the surveillance dragnet.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also yesterday, Chairman 
of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator John D. Rockefeller 
(D-WV), released his plan for an interim FISA fix.&nbsp; His proposal would also allow mass 
collection of Americans’ communications, would permit the vast amount of data to 
be subsequently datamined.&nbsp; This 
would bury any useful intelligence and would guarantee the collection and 
retention of countless phone calls and emails in the event that one party is 
within the United States.&nbsp; In 
addition, Senator Rockefeller proposes a sunset provision to re-examine the 
changes in six months.&nbsp; The Patriot 
Act reauthorization debacle makes clear that sunsets are a bad idea.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“This administration’s continued aversion to oversight and 
the rule of law shows a remarkable lack of respect for the American people,” 
added Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. 
“The FISA court is notorious for rubberstamping most applications for 
warrants.&nbsp; The moment that one judge 
says no, the administration calls foul and attempts to browbeat Congress into 
passing legislation that will give them carte blanche authority to wiretap 
Americans.&nbsp; Lawmakers must reject 
this political ambush and carefully consider any changes to FISA.”</p>
