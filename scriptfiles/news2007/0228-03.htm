<p>NEW YORK - February 27 - The US government should account for 
all the missing detainees once held by the Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA), Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

<p>The 50-page report, "Ghost Prisoner: Two Years in Secret CIA 
Detention," contains a detailed description of a secret CIA prison from a 
Palestinian former detainee who was released from custody last year. 
Human Rights Watch has also sent a public letter to US President George 
W. Bush requesting information about the fate and whereabouts of the 
missing detainees.   
  
<p>"President Bush told us that the last 14 CIA prisoners were sent to 
Guantanamo, but there are many other prisoners 'disappeared' by the CIA 
whose fate is still unknown," said Joanne Mariner, terrorism and 
counterterrorism director at Human Rights Watch. "The question is: what 
happened to these people and where are they now?"   
  
<p>In early September, 14 detainees were transferred from secret CIA prisons 
to military custody at Guantanamo Bay. In a televised speech on 
September 6, President Bush announced that with those 14 transfers, no 
prisoners were left in CIA custody.   
  
<p>The former CIA detainee, Marwan Jabour, told Human Rights Watch 
about a number of other people who were in CIA detention but whose 
present whereabouts are unknown. Jabour saw one of these men, Algerian 
terrorism suspect Yassir al-Jazeeri, as recently as July 2006 in CIA 
custody.   
  
<p>"The Bush administration needs to provide a full accounting of everyone 
who was 'disappeared' into CIA prisons, including their names, locations, 
and when they left US custody," Mariner said.   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch's letter to Bush contained two lists of missing 
detainees. The first list names 16 people whom Human Rights Watch 
believes were held in CIA prisons and whose current whereabouts are 
unknown. The second list names 22 people who may have been held in 
CIA prisons and whose current whereabouts are unknown.   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch expressed concern about what may have happened 
to the missing prisoners. One possibility is that the US may have 
transferred some of them to foreign prisons where they remain under the 
CIA's effective control.   
  
<p>Another worrying possibility is that prisoners were transferred from CIA 
custody to places where they may face torture. A serious concern is that 
some of the missing prisoners might have been returned to their countries 
of origin, which include Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Syria, where the torture 
of terrorism suspects is common.   
  
<p>The new report provides the most comprehensive account to date of life in 
a secret CIA prison, as well as new information regarding 38 possible 
detainees. The report explains that these prisoners' treatment by the CIA 
constitutes enforced disappearance, a practice that is absolutely prohibited 
under international law.   
  
<p>Marwan Jabour was arrested by Pakistani authorities in May 2004 in 
Pakistan and held for more than a month at a secret facility in Islamabad 
operated by both US and Pakistani personnel, during which time he was 
badly abused. In June, he was flown to another secret prison, which he 
believes was in Afghanistan, where all or nearly all of the personnel were 
American.   
  
<p>His clothes were taken from him when he arrived, and he was left 
completely naked for a month and a half, including during questioning by 
women interrogators and filming. He was chained tightly to the wall of his 
small cell so that he could not stand up, placed in painful stress positions 
so that he had difficulty breathing, and told that if he did not cooperate he 
would be put in a suffocating "dog box."   
  
<p>During the more than two years that he was held in this secret prison, 
Jabour spent nearly all of his time alone in a windowless cell, with little 
human contact besides his captors. Although he worried incessantly about 
his wife and three young daughters, he was not allowed even to send them 
a letter to reassure them that he was alive.   
  
<p>"It was a grave," Jabour later told Human Rights Watch. "I felt like my 
life was over."   
  
<p>The wife of another former CIA detainee whose whereabouts remain 
unknown told Human Rights Watch that she has had to lie to her four 
children about her husband's "disappearance." She explained that she 
could not bear telling them that she did not know where he was.   
  
<p>"What I'm hoping," she said, "is if they find out their father has been 
detained, that I'll at least be able to tell them what country he's being held 
in, and in what conditions."   
  
<p>Enforced disappearance involves arbitrary, secret and incommunicado 
detention, and poses a serious risk to the right to life and to protection 
from torture and other mistreatment. As these cases make clear, enforced 
disappearance also inflicts severe mental pain and suffering on the 
"disappeared" person's family.   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch expressed grave concern about President Bush's 
stated view that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 permits the 
government to restart the CIA's secret prison program. Human Rights 
Watch called upon the Bush administration to reject the use of secret 
detention and coercive interrogation as tactics in fighting terrorism, and 
announce that the CIA's detention and interrogation program has been 
permanently discontinued.   
  
<p>"The CIA program - and the civilian leaders who created it - have 
inflicted tremendous harm on the reputation, moral standing, and integrity 
of the United States," Mariner said. "It's time for President Bush to 
repudiate this program, and to take steps to repair the damage it has 
done."
