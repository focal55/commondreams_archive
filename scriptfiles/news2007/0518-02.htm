<p>NEW YORK - MAY 18 -Pope Benedict XVI, US President George W. 
Bush and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have undermined 
human rights by actively promoting prejudice against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender people, Human Rights Watch said today in its 
annual "hall of shame" to mark the International Day Against 
Homophobia.

<P></P>On May 17, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups in more than 50 
countries will commemorate the International Day Against Homophobia, 
an initiative launched in 2005 that commemorates the day in 1990 when 
the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from its roster of 
disorders.   
  
<P></P>At the same time, Human Rights Watch also pointed to four areas where 
advances in human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people 
have given reason for hope.   
  
<P></P>"This 'hall of shame' does not claim to include the worst offenders, but it 
highlights leaders who have lent their authority to denying basic human 
rights," said Scott Long, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. "Bush and Pope 
Benedict both speak of human dignity, but their homophobic words and 
actions undermine families and endanger health."   
  
<P></P>Leaders named to the "Hall of Shame" for their actions in the past year 
are:  
 
<P></P>*	Pope Benedict XVI: for undermining families. The leader of the 
Holy See has gone well beyond expressing the Church's 
theological views on homosexuality. The Pope has intervened in 
politics in many other countries to condemn and threaten figures 
who support equal rights or any form of recognition for lesbian and 
gay families. After Spain legalized same-sex marriage in 2005, 
Pope Benedict's Pontifical Council on the Family commanded 
Spanish officials to refuse to marry same-sex couples or even to 
process the paperwork if they tried to adopt a child.   
 
<P></P>*	US President George W. Bush: for jeopardizing public health. 
The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) 
requires that one-third of HIV-prevention spending go to so-called 
"abstinence-until-marriage" programs. These programs threaten 
the health of LGBT people by sending a message that there is no 
safe way for them to have sex, and by denying them life-saving 
information. In some countries, such as Uganda, grants from the 
$15 billion PEPFAR program have funded groups that actively 
promote homophobia; in others, they have drastically reduced 
condom provision.   
 
<P></P>*	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: for creating public 
and private scandals. President Ahmadinejad has overseen a 
widening campaign to "counter public immorality," arbitrarily 
arresting thousands of Iranians for dressing or behaving differently. 
In recent weeks, for example, thousands of women have been 
detained for not conforming to "correct" Islamic dress. In Iran's 
surveillance society, Ahmadinejad also uses religious vigilantes to 
raid homes and other private places in search of "deviant" behavior 
– including homosexual conduct. The Iranian regime polices 
public behavior and violates the right to privacy on a massive 
scale.   
 
<P></P>*	Roman Giertych, Polish Minister of Education and Deputy 
Prime Minister: for endangering children. Part of a right-wing 
government that has made homophobia a centerpiece of policy, 
Giertych's education ministry has proposed a law to fine or 
imprison teachers, school officials, or student human rights 
defenders who even mention homosexuality. Vital facts about safer 
sex and protection against HIV/AIDS could be banned from 
schools under the new law.   
 
<P></P>*	Bienvenido Abante, Member of the Philippine House of 
Representatives and Chair of the House Committee on Civil, 
Political and Human Rights: for trying to force his sexual 
orientation on others. Representative Abante has urged that 
homosexuals be "cured" and turned into heterosexuals. He has 
repeatedly blocked a landmark bill that would ban discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the Philippines. 
He has also suggested that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
people are excluded from the "definition" of human rights.  
  
<P></P>"Homophobia endangers basic human rights, and we should all be 
concerned by it," said Long. "Governments devalue families when they 
deny any family recognition. They endanger children when they silence 
any child."   
  
<P></P>Human Rights Watch also pointed to large and small gains that give 
reason for hope:  
 
<P></P>*	In Nepal, after years of abuse directed at lesbians, gays, and 
transgender people during a violent civil war, the authorities in 
February gave a meti (transgender person) in February an official 
citizenship ID with a gender listed as neither male nor female. This 
was first time that a government in South Asia has given 
transgender identity full state recognition.   
 
<P></P>*	In Denmark, Parliament in June extended equal access to 
reproductive technologies to lesbians and single women. Denmark 
in 1989 became the first country in the world to create civil unions 
for same-sex partners, but such unions have still discriminated 
against same-sex couples in many areas, including reproduction. 
The Danish decision marked a recognition of women's equal worth 
as parents, and a further step toward full equality.   
 
<P></P>*	In Mexico, Mexico City and the northeastern state of Coahuila 
passed civil-union laws opening recognition to same-sex couples. 
Unions solemnized in Coahuila must be recognized as valid across 
Mexico. These moves come after the 2003 passage of a sweeping 
federal antidiscrimination law offering protection against unequal 
treatment based on sexual orientation.   
 
<P></P>*	Internationally, the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of 
International Law in Relation to Issues of Sexual Orientation 
and Gender Identity were launched during the March session of 
the United Nations Human Rights Council. Adopted in November 
at a meeting of international legal experts in the Indonesian city of 
Yogyakarta, these groundbreaking principles spell out the 
international legal standards under which governments and other 
actors should end violence, abuse and discrimination against 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and ensure full 
equality.
