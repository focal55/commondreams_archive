<P></P>WHAT:   CODEPINK: Women for Peace sit-in Speaker Pelosi's Office to support  military mom Tina Richard's  demand for a meeting with Speaker Pelosi.  Currently, nearly a dozen peace protesters occupy the office with more planning to arrive throughout the afternoon.  "I am tired of being given the run-around from the Speaker.  Two weeks ago before I went on national television her office called urging a meeting. Now that the media has moved on she refuses to respond to my requests while always promising to do so.  I decided today that I will not leave her office until I either get a meeting scheduled or am told there will not be a meeting," said Tina Richards.

<P></P>WHEN:   Now- March 30, 2007 until Tina Ricards gets a meeting with Speaker Pelosi.

<P></P>WHERE:   235 Cannon House Building

<P></P>WHO:   Tina Richards, the mother of a Marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq and is now 80% disabled, is refusing to leave the office of Speaker Pelosi today until she gets an   answer -- "Will you meet with military families, vets and troops?"
           CODEPINK WOMEN FOR PEACE is an international peace organization working to end the Iraq War and prevent future wars.
