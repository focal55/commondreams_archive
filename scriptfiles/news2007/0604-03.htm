<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 4 - League of Conservation Voters (LCV) President Gene Karpinski issued the following statement regarding last night’s Democratic debate in New Hampshire:

                         

<P></P>
“As one of the most critical challenges our nation and our world faces, we are deeply disappointed that the media sponsors of [the] debate in New Hampshire did not raise the question of how to address global warming.

 

<P></P>Earlier this year, 164 New Hampshire towns voted at their Town Meeting in support of a resolution to address one issue: global warming. 

 

<P></P>While the majority of the candidates raised the challenge of global warming in their responses to other questions, the debates media sponsors ignored an issue that the people of New Hampshire and the rest of the country are deeply concerned about.

 

<P></P>We hope that the media sponsors will realize their mistake and encourage the presidential candidates to address global warming in Tuesday's Republican debate.

<P></P>###
