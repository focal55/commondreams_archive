<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 -  In a letter sent today to the White House, 108 environmental, business, consumer, faith-based, and energy policy organizations refuted President Bush's oft-stated claim that "nuclear power is a renewable source of energy."  The letter was also signed by 22 individual citizens.

<p>In his efforts to promote nuclear power and to initiate the construction of new nuclear power plants, President George W. Bush has frequently attempted to portray the technology as being "renewable."

<p>Most recently, for example, in an interview conducted by Juan Williams on National Public Radio on Monday, January 29, 2007, the President stated:

<p>"Well, if you're really interested in global warming and climate change, then it seems like to me that we ought to promote technologies to advance the development of safe nuclear power. It's a renewable source of energy, and at the same time has no emissions to it."

(see <http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7065633> for the full text of the interview)

<p>The letter's signers rejected that argument, writing: "Please be advised that nuclear power is neither a renewable nor a clean source of energy.  
<p>For that matter, oil, coal, and natural gas are also not renewable or clean sources of energy.

<p>"Nuclear power and fossil fuels are environmentally polluting and non-renewable sources of energy that produce long-term radioactive wastes and/or greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>"The primary renewable sources of energy are biomass (e.g., biofuels, biopower), geothermal, solar, water (e.g., hydropower, tidal, wave, ocean currents), and wind."

<p>The groups object to the President's efforts to revive the nuclear industry by defining it as "renewable" so that it might be included in a future federal Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard or supported by federal tax incentives or research and development programs specifically designed to promote renewable energy technologies.
