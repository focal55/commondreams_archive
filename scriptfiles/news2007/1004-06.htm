<p>  WASHINGTON - October 4 - Oil and gas development, road construction, 
border walls, invasive species and water contamination are just a few examples 
of the problems afflicting the National Wildlife Refuge System, according to a 
new report released Thursday by Defenders of Wildlife. Ten years after the 
passage of sweeping legislation intended to address these issues, national 
wildlife refuges continue to struggle with problems that threaten their ability 
to meet their wildlife-first mission. 
</p><p>Defenders of Wildlife 
released the report, “Refuges at Risk,” in advance of National Wildlife Refuge 
Week, October 7-14, to mark the 10-year anniversary of the passage of the 
landmark National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act in 1997. Despite the 
firm mandates set by this visionary legislation, the refuge system now faces a 
$2.5 billion operations and maintenance backlog and is poised to lose 20 percent 
of its staff nationwide.</p>
<p>“It is a travesty that 10 
years after Congress set new standards for the embattled refuge system, refuges 
have been eroded further by budget cuts and political maneuvering,” said Rodger 
Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife. “The act outlined core values 
and standards that all national wildlife refuges should meet, but refuge 
managers are being asked to do their jobs with one hand tied behind their 
backs.”</p>
<p>To raise awareness and 
garner support for the refuge system, Defenders of Wildlife is releasing its 
fourth annual report profiling 10 refuges that face particularly crippling 
threats. Although these threats vary, they are all examples of the general 
undermining of the most important mandates set out in the 1997 refuge 
improvement act, which include the refuge system’s responsibility 
to ensure biological integrity and 
diversity;
guarantee that all uses on a refuge are compatible 
with the purpose of protecting all wildlife; and 
secure adequate water quality and quantity for the 
needs of wildlife.
</p><p>“The 10 refuges 
highlighted in this report are examples of the kind of problems that hundreds of 
refuges all over the country are facing,” added Schlickeisen. “The Bush 
administration has neglected this important system of lands, and worse, has 
politically interfered with the scientific and professional judgments of refuge 
managers. As funds become tighter and the human footprint expands, the job of 
protecting our nation’s wildlife is getting harder and the need to enforce the 
refuge improvement act of 1997 is critical.”</p>
<p>The National Wildlife 
Refuge System was established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 and now 
includes 
548 refuges in all 50 states and several territories, encompassing nearly 100 
million acres. It is the largest network of lands in the world dedicated first 
and foremost to the protection of wildlife and habitat. Refuges support a rich 
spectrum of lands and provide crucial habitat for more than 285 threatened and 
endangered plants and animals. </p>
<p>"Our National Wildlife Refuges are the inheritance that we will pass along to future generations of both people and wildlife," said Rep. Jim Saxton (R-NJ).&nbsp; "It's a great network of refuges, but Congress has to fund them adequately and try to expand them as best we can.&nbsp; Every American can drive to a refuge in thier state, and there's a refuge within an hour's drive from every major city.&nbsp; Refuges are a national treasure where people can go and see wildilfe in their natural state."</p><p>In June, the U.S. 
House of Representatives approved $451 million to be spent on the 
refuge system, nearly a $56 million increase from last year. Although it is 
the largest increase in the history of the refuge system, it still only 
brings the system’s budget to the 2004 inflation adjusted level.&nbsp;However, 
even this funding is unlikely to reach 
America’s refuges because President Bush has since 
threatened to veto this bill.</p>

Refuges at Risk</strong> (in alphabetical order)<br>Click links to read a local press release for each refuge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/nj_refuge_lacks_law_enforcement.php" target="_new"><strong>Cape May 
NWR, 
NJ</strong></a></strong> 
– Each year, thousands of 
migratory songbirds, including the ruby-crowned 
kinglet and the 
Nashville 
warbler, arrive at this crucial 
stopping ground for birds traveling on the Atlantic Flyway. But year after year, 
they arrive to find that their precious habitat is not as they left it. Illegal 
all-terrain vehicle use, barely hindered by the refuge’s lone refuge enforcement 
officer, is tearing up the habitat, disturbing nesting birds and jeopardizing 
their food sources. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/montana_refuge_poisoned_by_runoff.php" target="_new"><strong>Hailstone NWR, 
MT</strong></a></strong> 
– This refuge is a vital hub for 
hundreds of migratory bird species that use the 300-acre lake and the 
surrounding area as a stopover and breeding ground. However, agricultural runoff 
has allowed excess salt and selenium from the soil to accumulate in the 
wetlands, and each year mallards, American white pelicans and hundreds of other 
species are harmed or even killed by the deteriorating water 
quality.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/border_wall_threatens_texas_refuge.php" target="_new"><strong>Lower Rio 
Grande Valley 
NWR, 
TX</strong></a></strong> 

– The territories of jaguarundi 
and ocelot extend into Texas from Mexico, where these rare cats roam among 300 species of 
butterfly and more than 500 species of birds. But the cats’ territories are not 
bound by international borders, and their habitat is threatened by a border wall 
that could destroy the biological integrity of the entire 
region.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/wa_refuge_cuts_programs.php" target="_new"><strong>Nisqually NWR, 
WA</strong></a></strong> 
– For years, local children 
living in an increasingly developed region have enjoyed and learned from this 
rich landscape, where pacific tree frogs chorus in the night and river otters 
dart after fish. Fewer children will be given this opportunity, however, as 
refuge staff are forced to cut back or eliminate educational programs that teach 
America’s future leaders how to appreciate and protect our 
environment.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/bridge_proposal_threatens_pea_island_refuge.php" target="_new"><strong>Pea 
Island 
NWR, 
NC</strong></a></strong> 
– This refuge boasts an enormous 
array of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, including breeding American 
oystercatchers and loggerhead sea turtles. A planned replacement bridge and 
highway would carve through the heart of refuge wetlands, requiring constant 
maintenance as even mild storms regularly inundate the road with sand and ocean 
water.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/development_threatens_va_refuge.php" target="_new"><strong>Rappahannock River 
Valley NWR, 
VA</strong></a></strong> 
– With one of the largest 
concentrations of bald eagles on the East Coast, this refuge provides wildlife 
with an island of wilderness in a region where urban development is steadily 
encroaching. Without the funds to acquire available neighboring land, the refuge 
is at risk of bring surrounded by development, making the refuge into a 
decorative center piece instead of a crucial wildlife 
oasis.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/ri_refuge_lacks_funds.php" target="_new"><strong>Rhode Island NWR Complex, RI</strong></a></strong> – Local children have long been taught the 
importance of the wildlife, habitat and ecology of Rhode Island’s five refuges 
that provide a haven for thousands of birds traveling the Atlantic Flyway, 
including hawks, falcons and songbirds. But lack of funds has forced refuge 
staff to cease their educational programs, despite an increasingly desperate 
need for environmental education in a quickly developing 
area.</p>

<p><strong><strong>San Luis NWR, CA</strong></strong> – With 95 percent of California’s wetlands 
drained, filled or destroyed, this critical stopover and wintering grounds for 
migratory ducks, geese and cranes along the Pacific Flyway is a haven for the 
weary travelers. But the water they find there is decreasing in quality and 
quantity, year upon year, due to commercial competition for 
California’s limited water supply.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/wi_refuge_threatened_by_invasive_species.php" target="_new"><strong>Trempealeau NWR, 
WI</strong></a></strong> 
- Thousands of wood ducks and 
black terns share these Wisconsin skies, located at the confluence of the 
Trempealeau and Mississippi rivers, with monarch butterflies, blue-winged 
teal, hooded mergansers and tundra swans. But these native beauties are under 
attack from a marching army of invasive plants and animals that severely 
undermine the environmental health of the refuge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/press_releases_folder/2007/alaska_refuge_under_drilling_threat.php" target="_new"><strong>Yukon Flats 
NWR, 
AK</strong></a></strong> 
– The retreat of a bitter winter 
and the arrival of spring brings millions of waterfowl to the refuge, where they 
transform the landscape from a quiet wilderness to a chaotic courtship and 
breeding ground. Efforts to drill for oil and natural gas in the refuge are 
threatening this ancient ritual as an ill-conceived land swap aims to trade away 
key habitat to industrial developers.</p>
