<p>MINNESOTA - September 17 - The upcoming Rural Youth Summit will connect young people from rural communities around the country to exchange ideas on the challenges and opportunities of living in rural areas. The “Rural Youth Summit: Revitalizing Rural America” will be held on October 26-27 in Ames, Iowa. Details can be found at: www.iatp.org.

 <P></P>

In every decade from 1950 to 2000, rural communities have lost large numbers of young adults to urban areas. Rural youth face a number of challenges, particularly related to jobs, access to capital, training and education. In addition, young people in rural areas have expressed that they haven’t felt valued as part of the community and lack social opportunities.

  <P></P>

“Young people living, working and studying in rural communities have a lot to say about how to address these and other problems,” said Amy Stratton, Rural Communities Organizer at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. “The Summit is designed to give rural youth a forum to put their ideas forward and work together.”

 
 <P></P>
Youth participants, defined as 35 and younger, and rural youth activists of any age are encouraged to submit presentation and workshop proposals for the Summit. University students, beginning farmers, new Americans, technical college students, young professionals, high school students, entrepreneurs, rural youth advocates, and young people who dream of living in rural areas are invited to participate.

  <P></P>

Highlights of the Summit include:
