<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services&#8217; (CMS) proposal to deny reimbursement for the implantation of the Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) device is right, Public Citizen said today.</p>

<p>The agency correctly found that the device &#8220;is not reasonable and necessary for treatment of resistant depression,&#8221; a decision that is very likely to result in the denial of reimbursement for implantation of this device in Medicare patients.&#160;</p>

<p>On Sept. 6, Public Citizen sought just such a negative &#8220;National Coverage Determination&#8221; in a letter it sent to CMS. It also petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reverse its&#160;July 15, 2005, approval of the device, which Public Citizen opposed when the agency first considered it.</p>

<p>The VNS is surgically implanted at the base of the neck, where it stimulates the vagus nerve, purportedly treating an ill-defined condition the company calls &#8220;treatment-resistant depression.&#8221; However, the device failed its only properly designed study.&#160;Nonetheless, the FDA found a way to overrule the unanimous recommendations of at least 20 staffers and approved the device.</p>

<p>&#8220;CMS&#8217;s decision likely represents the death knell for VNS in the treatment of depression,&#8221; said Peter Lurie, deputy director of Public Citizen&#8217;s Health Research Group. &#8220;Patients with depression are not well-served by having ineffective treatments available.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moreover, the government agency went beyond finding that the device is not &#8220;reasonable and necessary,&#8221; the standard for Medicare reimbursement, concluding that it &#8220;does not believe there is a treatment effect directly attributable to VNS therapy based on the current evidence.&#8221;&#160; In effect, the agency is telling the FDA that the device never met the criteria for FDA approval in the first place.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is high time for the FDA to admit that it erred and get this high-tech placebo off the market,&#8221; said Lurie.</p>
