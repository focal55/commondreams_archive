WASHINGTON - September 7 - Robert Greenwald and Brave New Films launched "The REAL Rudy Command Center" today, a short investigative report on Presidential Candidate Rudy Giuliani's decision to place New York City's Emergency Command Center in the World Trade Center, a site known to be the Nation's number one terror target. The video, the first in a YouTube series on-line at <a href="http://therealrudy.org" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">TheREALRudy.org</a>, lays out how Rudy went against the recommendations of experts making a decision that cost precious lives. 

</p><p>
Giuliani is often seen as running on his 9/11 record and "The REAL Rudy Command Center" calls into serious question the pledge the presidential hopeful made just this Tuesday to prepare every city in the US for a disaster. Family members and experts in "The REAL Rudy Command Center" explain Giuliani ignored evidence and wisdom and cost loved ones their lives. 
</p><p>
Andy Ansbro, a New York City fire fighter at Ground Zero on 9/11 explains the gravity of Giuliani's decision, "What would have been different if the Command Center was operational? The death toll for fire fighters would probably have been cut in half." "He had put his bunker right in the most dangerous spot in the city" says Eileen Tallon who lost her son Sean Tallon a New York City fire fighter on 9/11.
