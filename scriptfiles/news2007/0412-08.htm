(New York) -- Amnesty International USA today called for an
investigation of Dow Chemical Co. by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), based on letters showing that Dow management is
concerned about its ability to expand in India and is therefore
secretly pressuring the Indian government to rid the company of its
legal liabilities related to the Bhopal toxic chemical disaster.<p>In a November 8, 2006, letter to the Indian Ambassador to the United
States, Ronen Sen, Dow emphasized its interest in eliminating the
Bhopal impediment to investment in India. The letter said, "Our common
goal is to support economic growth in India, including key foreign
investments that will promote job creation, economic diversification
and technology updates. Thank you for your efforts to ensure that we
have the appropriate investment climate to facilitate forward-looking
investment and business partnerships."</p>

<p>"These letters are strong evidence that Dow believes pending legal
liabilities for the legacy of Bhopal present a barrier to investing in
India, but the company has not disclosed this to its shareholders,"
said Sanford Lewis, an attorney who has represented Dow shareholders,
including the New York City Pension Funds and Amnesty International
USA. "Furthermore, Dow is attempting to bypass the Indian courts in
this matter, by pressuring the executive branch."</p> 

<p>Specifically the letter requested that the government "withdraw its
application for a financial deposit against remediation costs [for
Bhopal cleanup]. Certainly a withdrawal of application would be
positive, tangible demonstration that the GOI means what it says about
Dow's lack of responsibility in the matter." Liveris was referring to a
Madhya Pradesh High Court case regarding cleanup of the toxic abandoned
factory site in which the Indian government has filed a brief asking
for a $22 million deposit toward cleanup costs.</p>

<p>A second letter, dated November 28, 2006, from Indian industrialist
Rajan Tata to the Indian Planning Commission, supports Liveris' request
and calls for government and corporate money to clean up the Bhopal
site and end Dow's liability. These apparent attempts to avoid
liability coincide with multiple rumors about a possible Dow buy-out?
claims Dow denies.</p>

<p>"Looking at these letters, it seems that Dow's refusal to address
the human rights of the Bhopal survivors may be having a serious, but
undisclosed, financial impact," said Amy O'Meara of Amnesty
International USA. "Shareholders have a right to know the facts. It is
our duty to the survivors in Bhopal to help ensure that this kind of
information is brought to light."</p>

<p>According to Amnesty International's written complaint to the SEC,
the letter from the Dow CEO presents "... a candid acknowledgment that
despite the settlement of prior civil litigation, the Company remains
stymied in India as a result of the ongoing impact of the Bhopal
disaster." It continues, "... considering the professed importance of
India as a market and production base for the Company's businesses in
the Asian region as a whole, we believe the impediment to investing in
India owing to the unresolved liabilities in Bhopal may constitute a
material matter that ought to have been previously disclosed by the
management to shareholders."</p>

<p>Amnesty has requested that the SEC investigate Dow's failures to
disclose pertinent information to shareholders, and calls on Dow
investors to demand increased disclosure by supporting a shareholder
resolution that requests the Company to report on any steps taken by
the company to address the needs of the survivors of the Bhopal
chemical disaster.</p>

<p>The resolution was filed by shareholders representing more than $278
million, led by the New York City Pension Funds. Said NYC Comptroller
William C. Thompson, Jr, "This letter shows concretely that Dow's CEO
is aware of how the remaining issues in Bhopal impede the company's
investing in India. This gives new momentum and support for our
shareholder resolution, calling for the company to report on new
initiatives by Dow to address the problems of the survivors. The CEO's
proposed solution, which would simply have the company wipe its hands
of this matter, seems impractical and unlikely."</p>

<p>The letters were unearthed by Bhopal survivor groups through a Right
to Information Request to the Indian government's Planning Commission.</p>

<p>Dow inherited responsibility for the Bhopal disaster from Union
Carbide, which owned the Bhopal factory. Dow purchased Carbide in 2001.
According to Amnesty International, more than 22,000 people have died
and more than 100,000 continue to suffer as a result of the 1984
disaster.</p></p></p></i><!-- #EndEditable -->
