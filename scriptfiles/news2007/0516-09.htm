<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 -Palestine Solidarity Campaign deplores the outbreak of violence between different political parties in the Occupied Territories.  The death toll of 37 since Sunday morning is a shocking statistic.  At the same time we condemn the Israeli government which continues to authorize military attacks, killing, injuring and wreaking destruction on the Palestinian people.

 

<P></P>This desperate situation of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank is the result of the Israeli occupation and the Western boycott of the democratically elected Palestinian government.

<P></P>The recent Oxfam report,  Poverty in Palestine: the human cost of the financial boycott  13 April 2007 predicted the current situation; “The Government of Israel and the international community should recognise how volatile the situation remains. Factional violence is continuing in Gaza and risks spiralling out of control. Informed observers believe that the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support, leading to even greater insecurity.

<P></P>This is backed up by the latest World Bank Report; Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency in the Palestinian Economy which clearly demonstrates that the result of Israel’s expansionism in the West Bank is the collapse of a viable Palestinian economy. 

<P></P>According to David Craig, World Bank Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza, Israel’s policies have devastated the Palestinian economy. "The restriction system has caused a rise in transaction costs, making Palestinian goods increasingly uncompetitive. Even more importantly, the system has created such a high level of uncertainty and inefficiency that the normal conduct of business in the West Bank has become exceedingly difficult and investment has been stymied," he said.

<P></P>"Palestinian economic revival is predicated on an integrated economic entity with freedom of movement between the West bank and Gaza and within the West Bank, unfettered Palestinian access to West Bank land for economic purposes, and reliable access to world markets," Craig added. "The restriction system has significantly undermined these conditions. Restoring sustainable Palestinian economic growth is dependent on its dismantling."

<P></P>Dr Eyad el-Sarraj, a psychologist who has explored the causes and effects of the recent violence in Gaza notes the traumatic and violent experiences of children growing up in the first Intifada who were subject to beating, bone-breaking, injury, tear-gas and even killing, as well as witnessing their fathers’ humiliating beatings at the hands of Israeli soldiers.  He says “these young men who are pursuing revenge and killing, and at times seeking even their own death, are the selfsame children who cherished so many dreams of a better life, but saw them fade away and fall apart the moment they saw their fathers fall defenceless victims of arrogant force, incarnated in the Israeli soldier.”  He also states that, “under deteriorating social, economic, political and psychological conditions, it is only natural, as we have already warned, that violence will prevail”

 

<P></P>Betty Hunter, General Secretary of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign said, “The tightening of the noose on the Palestinians is succeeding in heightening internal tensions, particularly in Gaza, but while Israel and the US may see this development as helping to achieve submission to their objectives, it is a highly dangerous strategy for the whole region.   International leaders must end the collective  punishment of the Palestinians for their exercise of democratic rights. The British government must end its economic and political boycott of the Palestinian people which amounts to collusion in the creation of a humanitarian crisis.”
