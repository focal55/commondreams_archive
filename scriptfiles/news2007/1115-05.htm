<p>TORONTO - November 15 -  In response to today's (Thursday Nov. 15)
decision by the Supreme Court of Canada to not hear appeals from American
Iraq-war resisters seeking refuge in Canada, the War Resisters Support
Campaign will ramp up pressure for a political solution, calling for a
provision from Parliament to allow resisters and their families to stay in
Canada.<P></P>
    The War Resisters Support Campaign will hold a demonstration tonight at
5 p.m. at 330 University Avenue, Toronto to call on Parliament to do the right
thing and allow resisters to stay in Canada.<P></P>
 
    Spokespersons will include<P>
      
        <strong>WHO:</strong>      War Resisters Support Campaign and allies<br>
        <strong>WHAT: </strong>Demonstration to ramp up pressure on Parliament<br>
    <strong>WHEN:</strong>     Thursday November 15 at 5 p.m.
    <br>
    <strong>WHERE:</strong>    330 University Avenue, Toronto (just north of Queen St. W.,
                 on the west side)
          <P></P>
          "We call on Parliament to take a stand by enacting a provision that would
allow US war resisters and their families to stay in Canada," said actor and
activist Shirley Douglas. "The Supreme Court has handed the issue back to
Parliament. It is urgent that Parliament demonstrate leadership and act in
accordance with Canadian tradition. Do not let the principles that Canadians
cherish slip away."
<P></P>
The Supreme Court decision by a panel of three judges prevents the full
court from reviewing the decisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board
regarding the refugee status of resisters Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey.
The Immigration and Refugee Board had refused to grant them refugee status.
  <P></P>
  Resisters have already found widespread support among Canadians,
including faith groups, unions, peace organizations and thousands of
individuals and families who have extended a welcome. In a June 2007 poll by
Strategic Communications, 64.6 per cent of respondents in Ontario think that
resisters should be allowed to stay in Canada (margin of error +/- 4%, 19
times out of 20).
  <P></P>
  The War Resisters Support Campaign has been assisting US war resisters
who come to Canada because of their opposition to the Iraq War since 2004.</li>
