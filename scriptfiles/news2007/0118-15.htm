<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - Tom Andrews, the National Director of 
              Win Without War, the nation's largest anti-war coalition, called 
              on Senate Democrats today to take binding action to stop the president's 
              escalation of the Iraq war and begin the redeployment of US troops 
              out of Iraq. Former US Congressman Tom Andrews (D-ME), said that 
              the non-binding bi-partisan resolution introduced yesterday in the 
              Senate could prove to be an obstacle to exerting political pressure 
              on members of Congress to take binding action on Iraq.
<p align="left" class="plain">He vowed an escalation of anti-war activism 
              demanding the action, starting with next Saturday's march on the 
              nation's capitol sponsored by United for Peace and Justice, a &quot;lobby 
              day&quot; at Congressional offices in Washington on Monday January 
              29th and a nationally coordinated &quot;Meet UP with Your Member&quot; 
              during the first Congressional District Work Period the week of 
              February 19th.</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain"><i>Tom Andrews issued an <a href="openlettertoSenDems.htm">open 
              letter to Senate Democrats</a>, excerpts of which are below. </i></p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;The president has bound this nation 
              to a catastrophic policy and has bound our soldiers to a hellish 
              nightmare in Iraq. We believe that it is imperative, therefore, 
              that members of the House and Senate take binding action that requires 
              the administration to reverse course in Iraq. Our men and women 
              in uniform and the American people need and deserve Congressional 
              action that has the force of law, including the exercise of its 
              power of the purse.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;We will take this demand to the 
              streets and Congressional offices in Washington and to District 
              Congressional offices across the country when Members return home 
              to face their constituents.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;Congressional action should be 
              as binding on the administration as the orders binding our soldiers 
              into harms way in Iraq.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;We are concerned that a non-binding 
              resolution on Iraq is being pursued in the Senate without a clear 
              linkage to binding Congressional action that would reverse the president's 
              disastrous course in Iraq. The Congress has an obligation to respect 
              and to implement the will of the American people.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;Members of the Senate and House 
              should not be led to believe that their obligation to our troops 
              in Iraq and to the American people is limited to the passage of 
              resolutions that can be ignored by an administration that shows 
              no intention of altering a failed policy.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;From the outset, the Bush administration's 
              Iraq policy has been rooted in denial and deception and carried 
              out with a lethal combination of arrogance, ignorance and incompetence. 
              His escalation of the war in Iraq is in defiance of what American 
              voters demanded of their government on November 7. It also defies 
              the views of our military leaders, a majority of our soldiers, and 
              the findings of the bi-partisan Iraq Study Group.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;Even worse, the additional troops 
              the president will order into Iraq are not certified as combat ready. 
              The Baltimore Sun reported last week that they would also be without 
              the protection of the latest armored vehicles that withstand bomb 
              blasts. It is an unconscionable failure to support the men and women 
              that are being sent into harms way in Iraq under these circumstances, 
              and it should be as unacceptable to the Congress as it is to the 
              American public.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left" class="plain">&quot;A demand that Congress stand up 
              to the administration and reverse course in Iraq was the single 
              most important reason that Americans cast their votes for change 
              in the November 7 elections. We are prepared to support congressional 
              efforts that demand an end to the president's Iraq policy. However, 
              we strongly believe that these efforts must be as binding on the 
              administration as the president's disastrous policy is on our troops 
              and the Iraqi people.&quot; </p>
