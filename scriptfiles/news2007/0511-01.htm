<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - <br>
<br>
WHO: The Pledge of Resistance was formed for individuals willing to engage in nonviolent civil resistance to first prevent and later to protest the war in Iraq. It is affiliated with several national peace groups, including the Iraq Pledge of Resistance, the National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance and United For Peace & Justice.

 

<P></P>Baltimore Pledge members have repeatedly risked arrest to protest the war with Iraq.  On September 26 & 27, 2006 they joined with activists from around the country in protests organized by the Declaration of Peace aimed at telling Congress to cut off funding for the war in Iraq.  In response, religious and secular peace activists were denied access to their legislators and arrested on Capitol Hill.  The 71 peace activists arrested on Sept. 26 were charged with either “crossing a police line” or “unlawful assembly.”  The 26 citizens who were arrested outside the Rayburn House Building on Sept. 27 were charged with “unlawful assembly.” Nine Baltimore activists were arrested in September: Maria Allwine, Ellen Barfield, 

<P></P>Rev. Andrew Foster Connors, Mike Dorn, Donny Gann, Elizabeth McAlister, Max Obuszewski, Richard Ochs and Rev. Roger Scott Powers.  

 

<P></P>WHAT:  The defendants were either prosecuted in a trial which concluded on February 16, 2007 or on March 14, 2007.  Both trials were conducted by Chief Judge Rufus King III, and all Baltimore activists were convicted and sentenced to pay a $50 assessment fee.  At least ten defendants, including Allwine, Dorn, McAlister and Obuszewski, wrote letters to the judge to inform him that in good conscience they would not pay the fee.  They felt they were unjustly convicted, and paying the fine would be an admission of guilt.  King, in response to the government’s brief urging the activists to be held in contempt, ordered them to appear for a show cause hearing. 

 
<P></P>WHEN:  Friday, May 11, 2007 at 9 AM

 

<P></P>WHERE:  District of Columbia Superior Court, 500 Indiana Ave., NW, Washington, DC 

 

<P></P>WHY:  Obuszewski wrote a brief to King stating his position:  “As a long-time dissenter to unjust government practices, the defendant frequently interacts with police. It is not unusual for the police to deny citizens their Constitutionally-protected rights.  For example, on March 20, 2006 the defendant tried to carry a coffin to the Pentagon.  The Pentagon Police erected a barrier to prevent him from leaving a parking lot a half-mile from the building.  In Alexandria, Virginia, on June 16, 2006, he was convicted by a magistrate judge for failure to obey a lawful order.  On May 3, 2007 oral arguments were heard on an appeal before Judge T.S. Ellis.  Ellis expressed great concern for the First Amendment right of the defendant who tried to express his grievance about the war but was stymied by a barricade.” On May 9, the government dismissed Obuszewski’s conviction.

 

 <P></P>On May 3, upon returning from the appeal hearing in Alexandria, Obuszewski joined other Pledge members who carried a commemorative coffin from an area near Baltimore’s Washington Monument north on Charles Street and over to the Maryland National Guard Armory on Howard Street.  Then the names of the dead from Iraq were read.  The public was alerted that participants opposed members of the Maryland Guard from being sent to Iraq. There were no police lines, no arrests and no denial of protected Constitutional rights.  But on September 26, 2006, Obuszewski’s First Amendment right was violated.  Unfortunately, Judge King denied his First Amendment argument at trial.

 

<P></P>Mike Dorn, Elizabeth McAlister and Max Obuszewski will be in court for the show cause hearing.  They expect to be incarcerated for their refusal to pay the fee.  Regardless of what happens at the hearing, this case will continue as Obuszewski and others have appealed the conviction.  Protecting the right to dissent is a matter of urgency in these troubled times.  The protests against this awful war will continue.
