<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - Religious Right organizations are using governmental displays of the Ten Commandments to project a message of religious exclusion and intolerance, Americans United for Separation of Church and State has told a federal appeals court.
<P>Observes the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director, &#8220;The Religious Right is using a sacred religious symbol as a weapon in the culture war. It&#8217;s demeaning to religion, deeply divisive in a diverse nation and clearly unconstitutional.&#8221;</P>
<P>In a <A href="DocServer/Green_v___Haskell_County_No__06-7098_Americans_United_am.pdf?docID=1381">friend-of-the-court brief</A> filed with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Americans United attorneys trace the Religious Right&#8217;s use of the Commandments and explain how the symbol has been appropriated to wage war against religious diversity.</P>
<P>AU argues that officials in Haskell County, Okla., violated the constitutional separation of church and state by erecting a Commandments monument in front of the county courthouse in November of 2004. A federal district court upheld the display, and the case is now on appeal.</P>
<P>The AU brief demonstrates that the Commandments have become a flashpoint for Religious Right activism in recent years and that the Decalogue&#8217;s display on public property in recent times is often part of a Religious Right-led crusade to assert Christian dominance.</P>
<P>&#8220;Against this historical backdrop, contemporary displays of the Ten Commandments convey to the public a different message than displays erected 50, 40, 30, or even 20 years ago,&#8221; asserts Americans United. &#8220;After a decade-long campaign to reclaim America from religious heterogeneity, the Christian Right has transformed the Commandments into a potent symbol of Christian supremacy  and ergo, a symbol of the inferior status of non-Christians in the political and legal spheres.&#8221;</P>
<P>The brief discusses several high-profile legal and political battles over the display of the Commandments, including former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore&#8217;s losing crusade to display a 2.5-ton Commandments monument at the state judicial building in Montgomery.</P>
<P>Moore&#8217;s display, Americans United asserts, was no mere recognition of the Ten Commandments&#8217; influence on the law. Rather, it was &#8220;intended to affirm the truth of the belief that divine law supersedes civil law, by conveying a message to the public that Christianity and Christian law (in the form of the Decalogue) reigns supreme  not just over the American legal system, but also over all other religions.&#8221;</P>
<P>The AU brief in <EM>Green v. Board of County Commissioners of the County of Haskell</EM> points out that the display has increased community rancor. A county commissioner hung up on one woman who called to complain, saying he does not speak to non-Christians. At a pro-Commandments rally, a local pastor implied that foes of the display would be lynched if they dared speak out.</P>
<P>The Americans United brief, filed Jan. 30, was prepared by AU Legal Director Ayesha N. Khan, AU Assistant Legal Director Richard B. Katskee and AU attorney Heather L. Weaver.</P>
<P id=aboutau>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom. </P>
