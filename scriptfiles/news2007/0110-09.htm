<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - Today, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sued the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for its failure to adequately respond to CREW’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for documents related to the destruction of Secret Service visitor record logs. <br />
<br />
On September 27, 2006, CREW filed a FOIA request with NARA asking for communications with the Secret Service in which NARA ordered the Secret Service to stop destroying White House visitor logs. The Secret Service maintains the logs until they are transferred to the White House.  CREW filed suit because NARA has refused to provide these records.<br />
<br />
CREW became aware of NARA’s order through a lawsuit CREW had filed against the Secret Service, requesting records of visits Jack Abramoff and Abramoff associates had made to the White House and the residence of the vice president.  <br />
<br />
In a related case, the Secret Service and the White House have claimed that all of the visitor records are presidential, not federal agency records and, therefore, are not subject to public disclosure under the FOIA.  NARA is the agency responsible for ensuring that both federal agencies and the President comply with record keeping laws. <br />
<br />
“NARA’s blatant refusal to respond to CREW’s FOIA regarding the destruction of important historical documents makes it clear that this administration is intent on keeping the public in the dark about how the White House is conducting the people’s business,” Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said today. “What is the White House trying to hide?”<br />
