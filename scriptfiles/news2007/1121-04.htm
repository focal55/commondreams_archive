<p>TORONTO -  November 21 - The Canadian Arab Federation (CAF) has added its voice to the growing demand that US war resisters be allowed to stay in Canada . On November 15, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that it would not hear the appeal of former US soldiers Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey. That decision increases the urgency for an immediate political solution that would allow all resisters to stay in Canada .
 <P></P>
“These men and women made the same brave decision that the Canadian government did in 2003,” says Khaled Mouammar, president of CAF. “Canadians were right to oppose the war on Iraq , and so are the US war resisters. We should let them stay.”
  <P></P>
US soldiers who refuse to fight in Iraq face lengthy prison sentences in the US . “If US soldiers refuse to fight in an illegal and immoral war, they shouldn’t spend half an hour in a prison cell, let alone five years,” adds Mohamed Boudjenane, Executive Director of CAF. “Canada must not deport these young men and women to a prison sentence.”
  <P></P>
CAF is calling on its members and supporters to contact their Members of Parliament, asking them to support the demand to let US war resisters stay in Canada .
