<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 29 - Veterans For Peace calls on Congress and the President to follow the will of the people, end the war in Iraq and Bring Our Troops Home Now! After several weak and timid attempts to force President Bush to change course in Iraq, Congress led by Democrats agreed to remove deadlines that called for the withdrawal of US troops.

<P></P>Michael McPhearson, Veterans For Peace National Executive Director states, “The Democrats gained power based on the fact that a clear and growing majority of US citizens want to see the Iraq war ended, and believe that invading Iraq was a bad idea. The illegal and immoral policy has failed but the President and Congress are continuing to take us down the same path. The people have spoken, but our leaders are not listening.”

<P></P>“It’s a tragedy that as we commemorate the fallen and past service members on Memorial Day the Commander in Chief and Congress continue down a road that will ensure the needless deaths of current service members and Iraq civilians,” comments VFP National President Elliot Adams. 

<P></P>He went on to say, “Since November when the Democrats took power 623 service members have been killed including nearly one hundred in May. With all these deaths and an unknown number of Iraqis, the situation has only worsened. The new Congress has acquiesced to the President and abdicated their responsibility to act as a check and balance. It is up to us the people to take more vigorous action to force our government to show real support for the troops, bring them home now and take care of them when they return home.”

<P></P>In early May a majority of Iraqi lawmakers signed onto a nonbinding legislative petition calling on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal. Few US news outlets reported the story or confronted the President with the irony of the vote as the US government haggled over times lines.

<P></P>Veterans For Peace calls on all its members to continue efforts to end the war. They ask all people who are concerned about the direction of our country to remind the government that this is a nation for and by the people. The people demand the war end. End it and Bring Our Troops Home Now!
