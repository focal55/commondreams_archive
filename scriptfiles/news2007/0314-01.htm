<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - March 13 - Forty-five environmental and other organizations will join together for the first Climate Crisis Action Day on March 20th from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. in Washington, DC.  Speakers at this first carbon-neutral global warming event, taking place on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol include: Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT); Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA); award-winning outdoors television host Tony Dean; Father Charles Morris from Wyandotte, MI; and Mayor Robert Sisson (R) of Sturgis, Michigan. The master of ceremonies will be long-time Washington, DC radio personality "Weasel," from 94.7FM The Globe.  It is the nation's first "green" radio station.  Visuals will include a giant inflatable earth on fire, and thousands of advocates in crimson T-shirts and the event will be covered live by 94.7FM the Globe.

 

<p>Thousands of Americans will come to the Capitol to meet with their senators and representatives to urge them to support swift, steep reductions in global warming pollution and protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

 

<p>In January 2007, concerns about critical melting of sea-ice, a mainstay for polar bear habitat, led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to propose listing the bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. 

 

<p>In February 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its report demonstrating that human emissions of heat-trapping gases are the primary cause of global warming. Further warming will cause sea levels to rise and more frequent, intense extreme weather patterns.  Because Arctic temperatures are rising four times faster than global average, Alaska faces the most climate change damage in the U.S. The IPCC report notes that Arctic sea ice shrunk by over 20% since 1978. 

 

<p>On March 20, 2007, speakers will address thousands of Climate Crisis Action Day participants on the global warming threat.

 

<p>Why must we act now to fight global warming? -- Science tells us that we can prevent the worst effects if we cut emissions enough to keep temperatures from rising more than 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit above today's levels. 
<p>What is at stake? -- The Arctic and other pristine public lands face thawing, drought, forest fires and other warming effects. Sea level rise could create millions of "eco refugees" as people flee coasts. 
<p>What can we do? -- On March 20, 2007, thousands of "Climate Crisis Action Advocates" in crimson t-shirts will gather at the West Front of the U.S. Capitol from 11-1 p.m.  After, participants will visit their senators and representatives to urge them support investments in efficiency and renewable energy, reduce global warming pollution, and protect the Arctic wilderness.
