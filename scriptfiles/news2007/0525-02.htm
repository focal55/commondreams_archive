<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 25 - “The failure of democratic leadership of G8 leaders is undermining democracy.” said CIVICUS’ Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo “As their ‘war on terror’ intensifies countries supposedly concerned about democracy are lowering the democratic bar rather than raising it, thus effectively threatening civil dialogue and democracy.”

<P></P>The focus theme of the World Assembly being Accountability, Naidoo emphasised the need for World Leaders to ‘walk the talk’ regarding democracy. Addressing the media at the press launch of the CIVICUS World Assembly in Glasgow, Scotland, he brought up the recent intimidation of activists in Germany where some 100 odd homes and centres of activists were raided as a pre-emptive measure. The German police was thus aiming to prevent activist to excercise their right to gather and express themselves at upcoming G8 Meeting in Germany.

<P></P>“When we talk with the Mugabe regime and the likes, they tell us: ‘Why are you on our doorstep? We did not create Guantanamo prison, we did not invade Iraq, we did not fly people around the world to be tortured in remote prisons’.” Naidoo said. “G8 Leaders have to understand the reach of these actions; their war on terror provides is used by dictatorial regimes as an excuse to do likewise and imprison and torture opposition members.” Underlining Naidoo’s words, CIVICUS and Amnesty International launched a campaign to free political prisoners in for instance in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Syria.

<P></P>“What we have been saying to Bush, Blair and those who see themselves as democracy promoters is that the real test of democracy is upholding the right to be heard. When these countries act in ways that undermine democratic space – enacting legislation for detention without trial, and invasion of privacy - it makes it more difficult for those people in countries struggling to promote democracy at more basic levels. “This is where the issues of democracy and development overlap, but why have there been no questions from countries supposed to be more concerned with democracy. Here is the link between voice, development and democracy, “ said CIVICUS Chairperson Aruna Rao. She noted that the 1,000-plus CIVICUS delegates from some 140 countries will engage in learning, sharing and strategising on how to interface with governments and other institutions, organisations and agencies, to counter threats to civil space and democracy at large.

<P></P>Martin Mulligan, Chief Executive of the Scottish Council of Volunteer Organisations, co-hosting the World Assembly, underscored the increasing importance to think local and act global for civil society to better connect to a much smaller world. “This Assembly provides activists to seek partners of other civil societies in campaigns so as also think global and local.”
