<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 6 - Grist (<a href="http://www.grist.org" target="_new">www.grist.org</a>), the world's leading source of daily news and opinion on the environment, today launched a <a href="http://lists.grist.org/t?r=2&c=1977&l=35&ctl=16D9A:BC9CB21339A554A13D2E1572223334D1" target="_new">comprehensive chart</a> detailing the presidential candidates' views on energy and climate change, as part of its "How Green Is Your Candidate?" series (<a href="http://www.grist.org/pres08" target="_new">www.grist.org/pres08</a>).
<P></P>
Election '08 Developed in collaboration with AlternativeEnergy.com, Grist's expanded candidate coverage provides the most comprehensive information available about the candidates' voting records and platforms related to climate and energy.
<P></P>
"This new chart gives voters an easy-to-view, side-by-side comparison of the candidates' positions on climate and energy -- critical campaign issues that have been largely ignored by the mainstream media," said Chip Giller, Grist founder and president. "Grist's series features the most comprehensive information about presidential contenders' environmental views on the web or anywhere else. We are grateful for the support of AlternativeEnergy.com, which has allowed us to expand this series."
<P></P>
The chart, which will be updated throughout the campaign, will be simultaneously available on AlternativeEnergy.com, a new social networking site dedicated to accelerating the deployment of alternative energy solutions. "We are very proud of our relationship with Grist, which has become a leading source of expertise on the candidates' environmental positions," said Doug Schiller, AlternativeEnergy.com's president and CEO. "The new content will be a great resource for our visitors who are eager to find ways to make the country energy independent. As many of our nation's leaders in both business and government have noted, alternative energy is our generation's defining issue and perhaps the greatest business opportunity ever."
<P></P>
The chart includes at-a-glance facts as well as links to more in-depth candidate information. It supplements Grist's existing, comprehensive campaign coverage, which includes exclusive interviews with 12 presidential candidates and extensive fact sheets on all major Republican and Democratic contenders, with detailed information on their environmental platforms and voting records, as well as video and audio clips of environmental statements they've made.
<P></P>
Descriptions of candidates and their positions are not and should not be perceived as endorsements. Grist does not endorse political candidates.
