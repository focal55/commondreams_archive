<p>WASHINGTON - May 14 - President Bush today issued an executive order that directs the Environmental Protection Agency to write new rules under the Clean Air Act in an attempt to reduce gasoline consumption and address climate change by expanding alternative fuels and tightening fuel economy standards.

 

<P></P>Environmental Defense welcomes President Bush’s interest in reducing global warming pollution from cars and his acknowledgement that EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. But the initiative will fall far short of fixing the climate problem if it does not include a firm cap on carbon.

 

<P></P>“Whether EPA will lead the fight against global warming or lead us to a hotter planet remains to be seen,” said Environmental Defense President Fred Krupp. “The litmus test must be real reductions in carbon emissions, and those can only come from real limits.”

 

<P></P>“It’s time for this administration to join with the mainstream of American businesses and support a cap on carbon,” Krupp said.

 

<P></P>Environmental Defense is a member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a coalition of leading U.S. businesses and environmental groups calling on this Congress to adopt an economy-wide cap and trade system for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The group’s 22 members from across the U.S. economy include GE, Caterpillar, AIG, Shell, DuPont and GM.
