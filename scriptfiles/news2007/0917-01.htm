<p>WASHINGTON - September 16 - CODEPINK Women for Peace will lead a coalition of anti-war groups on a
tour through the halls of Congress on Monday afternoon targeting
members who are staunch supporters of the Iraq war, encourage military
strike against Iran, violate civil liberties, and those who receive
oil and defense monies, andl induct various Members of Congress into
the People's Hall of Shame. The delegation of about 50 women and men
from around the country will visit their representatives (House and
Senate side) to shame them for misrepresenting the will of the
American people. A special visit is planned to Ike Skelton's office
who just last week used profanities when referring to the CODEPINK
women present at the Petraeus hearing.
<P></P>
<strong>WHEN:</strong> Monday, September 17th, start at noon, rally at 1:30pm. Press
availability at both times and locations
<br>
<br>
<strong>WHERE: </strong>Lunch meeting at Rayburn Office Building Cafeteria at 12pm
Rally at entrance of the Rayburn Office Building on Independence Ave at 1:30pm
<br>
<br>
<strong>WHO:</strong> CODEPINK Women for Peace leading a delegation of approximately 50
women and men, members of ANSWER and other peace groups
<br>
<br>
<strong>VISUALS</strong>: Some out-of-touch Members of Congress will be given EXIT
STRATEGY certificates with a 'how to' for exiting the Hall of Shame as
well as some suggestions on getting out of Iraq; pink costumes,
singing. Great photo opps!
<P></P>
The guided tour will include office visits to Republicans and
Democrats. Some reps on the list are: Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) who
supports proposals to exempt the CIA from any ban on torture, Senator
Joe Lieberman (ID-Conn) who has called for military action on Iran's
nuclear facilities and has repeatedly threatened Iran as response to
alleged involvement in attacks on Americans in Iraq and other Members
of Congress.
<P></P>
"Many people in Congress have become totally disconnected from the
people. We see this in their support for the war in Iraq and a new war
in Iran, and for taking away our precious civil liberties," says
CODEPINK cofounder Medea Benjamin. "We'll be inducting these
out-of-touch reps into the People's Hall of Shame and telling them to
'shape up or we'll vote them out. We here in Washington, D.C. must
take the halls of Congress back for the People!" says Desiree Fairooz,
CODEPINK DC Coordinator.
<P></P>
CODEPINK is the national women's peace group that has most recently
garnered international attention when its members "disrupted" General
Petraeus' report on Iraq. Started in the lead-up to the Iraq war,
CODEPINK has inspired thousands of women throughout the United States
and the world to make the color pink synonymous with political rabble
rousing.<!-- #EndEditable -->
