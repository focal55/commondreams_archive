<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. / LAGOS, NIGERIA - May 7 - Grameen Foundation has
announced its first Growth Guarantee transaction in Sub-Saharan Africa:
US$1 million for Lift Above Poverty Organization (LAPO), a leading
microfinance institution (MFI) in Nigeria. Citibank, acting through its
subsidiary in the country, The Nigeria International Bank (NIB),
structured the US$1mm Naira equivalent loan supported by a US$500,000
guarantee from Grameen Foundation. This marks the first transaction
between a Nigerian MFI and NIB/Citibank, and it is also LAPO’s first
leveraged commercial bank transaction.  <br>

<br>
This financing will support LAPO’s aggressive expansion plans to serve
an increasing number of customers in Nigeria that currently lack access to
formal financial products and services.  It will also allow LAPO to tap new
sources of funding, previously only available from donors or subsidized
loans.<br>
<br>
"LAPO has made tremendous strides over the past few years to become a key
player in Nigeria's microfinance industry, and we are pleased to support
their continued growth," said Alex Counts, President and CEO of Grameen
Foundation.  "There are an estimated 40 million Nigerians who could
benefit from microfinance, and we hope this watershed transaction will
encourage greater support for microfinance from Nigeria’s commercial
institutions."  LAPO has been a Grameen Foundation partner since 2002,
growing from 15,000 clients to its current outreach of 90,000.  It intends
to reach more than 225,000 clients by 2008.  <br>
<br>
In Nigeria, more than 70 million people live in poverty.  But in the 935
communities in the 8 states served by LAPO there is hope for progress. 
"This wonderful partnership with Grameen Foundation and Citigroup will
certainly expand and strengthen LAPO’s outreach significantly, which
means better businesses and better living for our clients," said Godwin
Ehigiamusoe, LAPO’s founder and executive director.  <br>
<br>
"We believe that microfinance is a key weapon in reversing sub-Saharan
Africa’s growing poverty rates," said John Doerr, a Grameen Foundation
board member and ardent Africa champion.  "Attracting commercial funding
will help LAPO and other MFIs expand their operations and open new doors
for them."  <br>
<br>
This structure is in line with Citi's global objective to support the
development of microfinance.  Emeka Emuwa, Citi's Country Manager said,
"This transaction diversifies commercial funding sources available to LAPO
and also supports the Government of Nigeria's objectives of building more
inclusive financial systems."<br>
