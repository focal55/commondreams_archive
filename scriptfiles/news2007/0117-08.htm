<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - A new TV ad criticizing Senator John McCain (R-AZ) for his long-standing demand to send more U.S. troops to Iraq, and for supporting the president’s escalation plan, will run in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally beginning Wednesday.

 

<p>The spot will air as opposition to the President’s escalation plan continues to grow nationally and as some Republicans indicate that they may abandon the president. McCain’s support of escalation in Iraq flies in the face of the voters, top military leaders, a growing number of Republican senators and congressman, and a newly emboldened Democratic congressional majority.

 

<p>Opponents of the war from all parts of the country have begun action campaigns to demand that Congress block the escalation. Last week more than 1,000 opposition rallies were held in all 50 states and a new campaign was launched–Americans Against Escalation in Iraq which brings together labor unions, veterans’ organizations, domestic agenda groups and anti-war organizations.

 
<p>“McCain’s escalation will make a bad situation worse. The American people sent a message in November that they want a change that will bring our troops home. Escalation is the wrong way–sinking us deeper and deeper into the quagmire in Iraq,” said Tom Matzzie, Washington Director of MoveOn.org Political Action.

 

<p>“Either this is a political ploy or its delusional thinking – either way, the experts and the voters agree that escalation makes the quagmire in Iraq worse,” Matzzie concluded.
