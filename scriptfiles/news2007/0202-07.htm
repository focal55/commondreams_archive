<p>WASHINGTON - February 2 - "The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lays to rest the notion that the alarming and increasingly rapid increase in the earth's temperature is due to anything other than human activity. Today we can already see the effects of global warming all around us. The report points to some extremely troubling and dire consequences on the horizon if we don't act soon and begin to dramatically lower our carbon emissions.</P>

<P>"The good news is that while we have a very serious challenge on our hands, we know exactly what we have to do meet that challenge, and we have the tools to do so. Just this week an independent report by a group of national energy experts demonstrated that we can use the smart energy solutions that we have today-wind, solar, and energy efficiency-to achieve the vast majority of the reductions we need by mid-century (the full report can be read here: [http://www.ases.org/climatechange/]). Investing in the solutions that will fuel the economy of tomorrow by creating clean, cheap, and renewable energy stands to create thousands of new good-paying jobs and revitalize the manufacturing sector in this country.</P>

<P>"The vast majority of the American people understand that global warming is real, is serious, and needs to be addressed. Mayors, governors, and state legislatures are taking the lead and implementing policies that protect our environment, create jobs, and fight global warming and our dangerous dependence on oil. Even major corporations are calling for action. The IPCC report confirms the challenge we all face. The market stands poised to provide the solutions. The time has come for our national leaders to provide the political will."</P>
