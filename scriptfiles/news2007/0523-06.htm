<p>WASHINGTON - MAY 23 - “It is a poor time for China’s trade negotiators to talk tough with  
the American people who are still reeling from the tainted pet and  
animal food scandal. Last month, food imports from China were  
contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals, banned antibiotics, and  
bacteria. This week, regulators in Australia, Panama and the  
Dominican Republic pulled Chinese-made toothpaste from store shelves  
that contained a poisonous industrial solvent.  Some of the  
toothpaste was marketed to children under the brand name ‘Mr. Cool  
Junior.’

<P></P>“The safety of America’s imported food, ingredients and consumer  
products should be job one of U.S. trade negotiators. The United  
States should not trade away food safety for a few more non-stop  
flights to Beijing or empty promises to prevent motion picture  
piracy. Any discussions between the United States and China should be  
about how to improve China’s woefully inadequate and indifferent food  
safety regime.

<P></P>“At a minimum:

<P></P>     * All Chinese food and animal feed exports to the United States  
be halted until there are comprehensive inspections conducted of  
Chinese facilities by U.S. food safety officials.  These inspections  
must ensure that government inspection, sanitation and other food  
safety standards are equal to those met by U.S. food and animal feed  
producers.
 <P></P>    * For exports to be restored, all Chinese food and animal feed  
products destined for the United States need to be re-inspected at  
U.S. ports of entry.  These inspections must include physical  
inspection and residue and microbial testing.
  <P></P>   * Action being considered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture  
to approve the export of processed Chinese poultry to the United  
States needs to be halted.  China still has an avian flu problem, has  
not proven that it can meet U.S. food safety standards, and has not  
controlled the smuggling of illegal poultry products to the United  
States and other countries around the world.”
