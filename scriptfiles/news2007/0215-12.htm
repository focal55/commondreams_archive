<p>WASHINGTON - February 15 - National Security 
                  Archive General Counsel Meredith Fuchs today <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20070214/Fuchs_Testimony_2007_02_14.pdf" target="_blank">told 
                  the Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National 
                  Archives of the House Committee on Oversight and Government 
                  Reform</a> that, &quot;problems [with the Freedom of Information 
                  Act system] will not be solved unless Congress mandates solutions.&quot;
<p>Ms. Fuchs recommended that Congress reform the FOIA to require 
                  better annual reporting and tracking of FOIA requests, citing 
                  examples of processing delays as long as 17 years and agency 
                  mismanagement or obstruction of requests causing delay. She 
                  also called on Congress to stop agencies from playing litigation 
                  games that cost requesters and taxpayers' money and waste judicial 
                  resources. She referenced examples of agencies that fail to 
                  take responsible legal positions until after a requester has 
                  filed a lawsuit and then suddenly reverse course when it becomes 
                  clear that a court will likely rule against the agency. She 
                  advocated revision of the FOIA's attorneys' fees provision as 
                  a solution. Ms. Fuchs explained that, &quot;Despite many outstanding 
                  people administering FOIA programs throughout the government 
                  - and they deserve praise for their work - there are far too 
                  many FOIA offices that fail to live up to the expectations of 
                  the law and the needs of the taxpaying public.&quot;</p>
                <p>Ms. Fuchs testified on a panel that included Clark Hoyt, former 
                  Washington Editor for Knight Ridder, who testified on behalf 
                  of the Sunshine in Government Initiative, and Carolyn Frederickson 
                  of the American Civil Liberties Union. In addition, representatives 
                  of the General Accounting Office and the Department of Justice 
                  testified. </p>
                <p>The Archive has been at the forefront of organizations using 
                  and assessing the Freedom of Information Act. The Archive has 
                  completed five government-wide audits of FOIA administration 
                  (supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation). Recommendations 
                  from the Archive's reports on those audits have been adopted 
                  in President Bush's Executive Order 13,392 (&quot;Improving 
                  Agency Disclosure of Information&quot;), included in FOIA legislation 
                  introduced in earlier Congresses by Senators Cornyn and Leahy, 
                  and Congressmen Smith and Waxman, and included as goals in many 
                  of the 91 agency FOIA Improvement Plans developed under the 
                  Executive Order.</p>
