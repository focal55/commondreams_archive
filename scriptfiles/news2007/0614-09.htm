<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 14 - <i>Today Rodger Schlickeisen, President of Defenders of Wildlife, offered the following statement on the successful committee vote on House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall’s major legislation addressing global warming and responsible energy policy. </i>
<P></P>“Today, the House Natural Resources Committee took a giant step toward putting America on the path toward a brighter, more sustainable future. By passing Chairman Rahall’s bill, and sending it to the full House for consideration, the Committee has set a great example for Congress, and the whole country, that it is time to act to address the threat of global warming and to improve the energy industry.

<P></P>“Defenders is particularly encouraged by the inclusion of the groundbreaking Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act, which would set America on a new course to tackle the impacts of global warming on wildlife and habitat. Global warming is the single biggest threat facing wildlife today, and the bill lays the foundation on which the survival of many of our native species will rely. A national strategy, based on scientific information, for assisting wildlife and habitat in adapting to global warming, combined with an appropriate level of federal funding, is the only way of ensuring that our nation’s wildlife remain at the center of our nation’s culture, landscape, and natural resources.

<P></P>“This bill also sets new, common sense standards for the oil and gas industries, which will protect America’s natural resources without stifling overall supply of our nation’s oil and natural gas. New incentives for states and federal agencies to pursue alternative energies, which make the most of our country’s geographical assets, are also featured in the bill. These inspired aspects of the bill will allow the U.S. to continue to grow economically, but in an environmentally responsible way, setting an example to countries throughout the world.

<P></P>“This Congress’ commitment to reforming energy policy in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way has been put in motion today. We commend Chairman Rahall for his leadership on this bill and applaud those who supported his efforts. If passed, this bill will ensure that generations to come will enjoy our nation’s diverse array of wildlife and special places as well as secure energy sources.”
