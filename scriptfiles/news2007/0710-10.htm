<p>WASHINGTON  - JULY 10 <br>
<br>
Who: "Miles for Peace", an extraordinary group of 14 young Iranian men and women who have been bicycling around the United States and Europe for peace; CODEPINK Mother and hunger-striker Leslie Angeline; Andy and Marjan Shallal, owners of Busboys and Poets- Andy is a cofounder of Iraqi Voices for Peace, Marjan is an Iranian peace advocate.
<br>
<br>Where: Busboys and Poets, 14th &amp; V St. NW, great photo opps<br><br>When: Wednesday, July 11, 8pm <br><br>Who: Miles for Peace, has been cycling throughout Europe and the United States since May 10. Their goal has been to promote people-to-people ties and present awards to elected officials promoting friendship.&nbsp; As young people, they represent the 70% of the Iranian people who are under the age of 30, and are trying to ensure a better future for their generation.
<br><br>Washington DC will be the final leg of their U.S. journey (from here they will be traveling to the Vatican to meet with the Pope). They will be meeting with Members of Congress to talk about promoting ties of friendship with the people of Iran.
<br><br>The event at Busboys and Poets will be a unique meeting of people and groups from various backgrounds to highlight the message of peace with Iran. Nowhere else will you find a group of young Iranians, Iraqi &amp; Iranian-Americans who are leaders in the peace and progressive business community in DC, a concerned mother who has been putting her body on the line to promote peaceful alliance with Iran and creative, colorful women for peace who are in the halls of Congress everyday to stop the next war now.
