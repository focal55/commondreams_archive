<p>MASSACHUSSETTS - MAY 21 - At its state convention Saturday, the Massachusetts Democratic Party propelled the national impeachment movement forward by passing a strong resolution on the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney. <br>

<br>
The resolution called on the state’s delegation in Congress to investigate Bush/Cheney for misleading our nation into war, torture and warrantless wiretapping – and “if the investigation supports the charges, vote to impeach” both Bush and Cheney “as provided in the Constitution.” <br>
<br>
The action by Mass Democrats builds momentum for investigation/accountability/impeachment of Bush/Cheney. Three weeks earlier, the California Democratic Party passed an impeachment resolution at its state convention. In Congress, Articles of Impeachment against Cheney have already been introduced (H Res 333). <br>
<br>
Mass Democrats became the 14th to have their state party endorse an impeachment resolution. PDA played a leading role in impeachment resolutions in California, Massachusetts and elsewhere. The Massachusetts resolution capped a two-month campaign by Progressive Democrats of America – kicked off by public forums in March in Western Mass featuring antiwar mom Cindy Sheehan and constitutional lawyer John Bonifaz. <br>
<br>
“Support for impeachment is growing nationally and is now mainstream sentiment within our party,” commented PDA Director Tim Carpenter, a Massachusetts resident. “This action by Mass Democrats helps put impeachment back on the table. So do the continuous revelations of an out-of-control White House, including sick-bed coercion to undermine the Constitution.” <br>
<br>
Carpenter continued: “Our message to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill is that impeachment is not a distraction. It’s not vengeful. It’s the only way to preserve the Constitution in the face of a White House that views itself as above the law.” <br>
<br>
To bring its message to Capitol Hill, PDA has just launched a novel campaign of sending <a href="https://www.pdamerica.org/impeachmints.php%20" target="_new">ImpeachMINTS</a> to Members of Congress – For a Fresher Democracy! <br>

<br>
TEXT OF MASS RESOLUTION (5/19/2007) <br>
<br>
<em>Whereas George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney have: <br>
* Deliberately misled the nation about the threat from Iraq in order to justify a war; <br>
* Condoned the torture of prisoners in violation of the Geneva Convention &amp; US law; <br>
* Approved illegal electronic surveillance of American citizens without a warrant; and, <br>

<br>
Whereas these actions have undermined our constitutional system of government, damaged the reputation of America, and threatened our national security, <br>
<br>
Therefore, the voters of the Massachusetts Democratic Convention call upon the Massachusetts delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives to investigate these charges and if the investigation supports the charges, vote to impeach George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney as provided in the Constitution of the United States of America. <br>
