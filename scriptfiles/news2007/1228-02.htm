<p>NEW HAMPSHIRE - December 28 -New Hampshire Peace Action and the American Friends Service Committee will dramatize their anti-war agendas in the last four days of the New Hampshire Primary campaign with the help of the Yellow Rose of Texas Peace Bus, a slogan-bedecked, full-sized coach.
<P></P>
During the four days between the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire Primary, the bus will travel around the state to campaign events with anti-war activists, Iraq war veterans, military family members, and religious leaders.  
<P></P>
"Peace must be a presidential priority," said Anne Miller, Director of NH Peace Action.
<P></P>
Miller said the Peace Bus participants will challenge all the candidates to:
<P></P><ul>
<li> Withdraw all U.S. troops and bases from Iraq within one year of taking office;

<li>Commit to resolve conflicts with Iran through diplomacy, not war; and
<li> Transfer money being spent on warfare to meet human needs, including housing, health, education, Iraqi reconstruction, and care for returning veterans.
</ul><P></P>
They are already planning to show up at events including
<P></P><ul>
<li> The Democrats' fundraiser on January 4 in Milford;
<li> The ABC-sponsored debates on January 5 at St. Anselm College in Goffstown; and 
<li> The Republican brunch on January 6 in Milford.
</ul><P></P>
Arnie Alpert, New Hampshire Program Coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee said the project is non-partisan, and will not support or oppose any of the candidates. "Our emphasis is not on how people should vote, but on our message to the candidates. We want to move the entire political debate toward a path to peace and justice," he said.
<P></P>
The bus is driven and owned by Jim Goodnow, a Vietnam veteran from Texas. 
<P></P>
The Peace Bus Project has been endorsed by the New Hampshire and Vermont chapters of Iraq Veterans Against the War, the Episcopal Peace Fellowship-NH, Vietnam Veterans Against War, and Veterans for Peace-AJ Muste Chapter.
<P></P>
New Hampshire Peace Action is a statewide, membership organization working to end the war in Iraq, prevent war with Iran, and support the abolition of nuclear weapons. 
<P></P>
The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization supported by people of many faiths who believe in peace, social justice, and humanitarian service. 
<P></P>
Additional information about the Peace Bus will be posted on the NH Peace Action website, <a href="http://www.nhpeaceaction.org" target="_new">www.nhpeaceaction.org</a>, and the AFSC's website, at <a href="http://www.afsc.org/nhprimary2008" target="_new">www.afsc.org/nhprimary2008</a>.  <!-- #EndEditable -->
