<div>WASHINGTON – The United States must take immediate measures to
curb global warming pollution to avoid a war-torn world fighting over
reduced water and food supplies, according to a report written by six
retired admirals and five retired generals in the U.S. military.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The report confirms what policy experts and scientists from the
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) have long warned: National
security is on the long list of potential casualties of global warming.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The following is a statement from Daniel Lashof, PhD, the science director of NRDC’s Climate Center:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Military leaders who are trained to recognize looming threats to
our national security have identified global warming as a critical
threat to peace throughout the world, and particularly to places where
conflict is already widespread, like the Middle East and Africa. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The report shows that environmental security is essential for our
national security. Americans are committed to protecting ourselves from
terrorist threats from all corners of the world. The report confirms
that stopping global warming is critical to keeping ourselves safe. It
underlines the urgency of addressing global warming with the same level
of national resolve as homeland security.</div>
