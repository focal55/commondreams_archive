<p>WASHINGTON - August 27 -
In the wake of today's announcement that Alberto Gonzales has resigned his position as United States Attorney General, the Constitution Project has called on the Bush administration to appoint a replacement who will respect the rule of law and protect the rights of American citizens.
<P></P>"For far too long this administration has stood idly by while the Constitution was ignored and circumvented," said Virginia Sloan, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Constitution Project.  "As the nation's senior law enforcement official, the Attorney General has a constitutional obligation to protect individual rights and prosecute those who have violated federal law.  President Bush should appoint an Attorney General whose record demonstrates a firm commitment to the rule of law, not just to his or her political patrons."

<P></P>The bipartisan organization also urged that the Administration take this opportunity to fully cooperate with the congressional investigation into the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program. 

<P></P>"The Department of Justice has long been complicit in the National Security Agency's unlawful surveillance of Americans," said Constitution Project senior counsel Sharon Bradford Franklin.  "A serious inquiry into the NSA's warrantless wiretapping scheme is long overdue, and Congress' oversight responsibility is not satisfied by Mr. Gonzales stepping down.  Mr. Gonzales' resignation should not be the end of investigations into abuses of the rule of law; it should mark a new beginning."
