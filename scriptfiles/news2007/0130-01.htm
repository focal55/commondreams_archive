<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 - One day after an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. 
attracted a crowd estimated at 100,000 by the <span class="media_outlet">Los 
Angeles Times</span>, the networks' Sunday morning talk shows remained mostly 
unaffected by the expression of broad opposition to the war, keeping their 
discussions confined to the narrow spectrum of Beltway elites.<br><br>Despite 
overwhelming public sentiment opposing the Iraq War—expressed in opinion polls, 
in the streets of D.C. and elsewhere around the country—the network Sunday shows 
booked guests more representative of the center-right spectrum in official 
Washington. <span class="media_outlet">NBC</span>'s <span class="media_outlet">Meet 
the Press</span> featured Republican governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who 
supports the Iraq War, and a roundtable discussion with Sen. Chuck Schumer 
(D-N.Y.), pro-escalation guests Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) and former White House 
speechwriter Michael Gerson, and Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings Institution, a 
prominent supporter of the Iraq invasion.<br><br><span class="media_outlet">CBS</span>'s <span class="media_outlet">Face the Nation</span> 
featured Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) as a critic of the White House, Sen. Mitch 
McConnell (R-Ky.) in support and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who remains 
undecided but who nonetheless stated that it "is premature to talk about cutting 
off funding."<br><br><span class="media_outlet">ABC</span>'s <span class="media_outlet">This Week</span> paired Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) with 
pro-escalation Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.). The show's roundtable skewed right 
(conservatives Torie Clarke and George Will were balanced by liberal columnist 
E.J. Dionne and <span class="media_outlet">ABC</span> reporter Martha Raddatz), 
but did not spend significant time discussing the war. <br><br><span class="media_outlet">Fox News Sunday</span> featured interviews with what host 
Chris Wallace called "two of the most intriguing figures in American politics": 
Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), who supports a non-binding resolution opposing 
Bush's troop "surge," and Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), a staunch supporter of 
the Iraq War. The <span class="media_outlet">Fox</span> roundtable skewed, as 
usual, to the right: conservatives Bill Kristol and Brit Hume were paired with 
<span class="media_outlet">NPR</span> reporters Juan Williams and Mara 
Liasson.<br><br>The limited debate in the network studios presents a remarkable 
contrast to public opinion. While these shows take apparent pains to present 
"balanced" discussions of the escalation of the war, the White House's "surge" 
is solidly opposed by the American public—63 percent are against the move, 
according to the latest <span class="media_outlet">CNN</span> poll 
(1/19-21/07).<br><br>And while guests who support cutting off funding for 
sending additional troops to Iraq are hard to come by in the mainstream media, 
the public is more open to such a tactic. The <span class="media_outlet">CNN</span> poll found 61 percent support for a Congress 
voting "to block the government from spending money to send more troops to 
Iraq." A recent <span class="media_outlet">Newsweek</span> poll (1/17-18/07) 
showed the public evenly split on the question of cutting off 
funding.<br><br>While the guests who appeared on the Sunday talk shows as 
critics of the White House certainly take issue with the way the Bush 
administration has handled Iraq, they are mild in their approach compared to 
anti-war leaders or public opinion. Schumer, for example, does not support a 
funding cut for the troop "surge," and still supports the notion of preemptive 
war (<span class="media_outlet">NBC</span>, 1/25/07). <br><br>Webb, one of the 
more forceful Senate critics, rejected a proposal from Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) 
to cap troop levels, saying it was "not the place or the time" to discuss such 
matters (<span class="media_outlet">Chicago Tribune</span>, 1/24/07). In his 
appearance of <span class="media_outlet">Face the Nation</span>, Webb did not 
directly answer a question about cutting off funding for the war. <br><br>Biden 
suggested on a recent appearance on <span class="media_outlet">Meet the 
Press</span> (1/7/07) that it is "constitutionally questionable" for Congress to 
set limits on troop numbers in Iraq or to cut off funds for the war. "As a 
practical matter," he said, "there is no way to say, 'Mr. President, 
stop.'"<br><br>Since the Sunday shows tend to prefer to interview elected 
officials, in light of Saturday's protests it would have made journalistic sense 
to hear from one of the nine co-sponsors of Sen. Ted Kennedy's <a href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=274867162&url_num=16&url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.00233:" title="" target="_blank">S.233</a>, a bill that would block funding for an escalation of 
the war in Iraq—a group that includes prominent senators like Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Pat Leahy (D-Vt.). Or, better yet, one of 
the House members who are backing <a href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=274867162&url_num=17&url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-508" title="" target="_blank">H.R. 
508</a> (the Bring Our Troops Home and Sovereignty of Iraq Restoration Act of 
2007), which calls for a full withdrawal of U.S. troops on a six-month 
timeline—a group that includes 28 representatives, including Lynn Woolsey 
(D-Calif.), Barney Frank (D-Mass.), Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and John Conyers 
(D-Mich.).<br><br>But seeing such guests on television is rare—even when they 
represent broad public sentiment. (Sixty-five percent of Americans want U.S. 
troops withdrawn either within a year or immediately, according to an <span class="media_outlet">L.A. Times</span>/<span class="media_outlet">Bloomberg</span> 
poll—1/13-16/07.)<br><br>The Washington protests were mentioned in passing on 
the Sunday shows. <span class="media_outlet">CBS</span> host Bob Schieffer called 
them "like a day from yesteryear" before mentioning that "many of those 
grievances will be heard not in the streets, but on the floor of the Senate." 
<span class="media_outlet">ABC</span>'s George Stephanopoulos put it more bluntly 
to guest Richard Lugar: "We saw tens of thousands of protesters here this week. 
Polls show that two-thirds of Americans almost oppose this plan. Doesn't 
Congress at some point, at some level, have a responsibility to give voice to 
that opposition?"<br><br>It's a good point—but when will the media give voice to 
that opposition?<br><br><span class="sub_headline"><b>ACTION</b>:</span><br>Tell the 
Sunday talk shows that their discussions of the Iraq War one day after massive 
anti-war protests should have reflected the broad opposition to the war. 
Encourage them in the future to present guests who represent the public 
consensus against the war and the escalation of the Iraq War—even if that means 
interviewing experts who aren't elected officials. <br><br><span class="sub_headline"><br><b>CONTACT</b>:</span><br><br><span class="media_outlet">ABC</span>'s <span class="media_outlet">This Week</span><br><a href="mailto:thisweek@abc.com" title="">thisweek@abc.com</a><br><br><span class="media_outlet">CBS</span> <span class="media_outlet">Face the
