<p>WASHINGTON - January 9 - MoveOn.org Political
Action announced its enthusiastic support for a bill introduced today by
Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) "to prohibit the use of funds for an
escalation of United States Forces in Iraq above the numbers existing of
January 9, 2007."
 <p>   The organization plans to put the full force of its members' energy and
fundraising capability behind ensuring that Democrats and Republicans in
both the House and Senate vote to pass the measure.
   <p> "Senator Kennedy is providing the leadership on Iraq that the American
people asked for in November. His resolution is entirely consistent with
the message Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent to the
president last week. An escalation in Iraq is the wrong way home -- it will
make things worse, not better," said Tom Matzzie, MoveOn's Washington
Director.
 <p>   "In the coming weeks and months, MoveOn members will press Congress on
both sides of the aisle to force President Bush not to escalate and to
start a responsible exit. Members will work all across the country and in
Washington, on the Internet and through advertising. Senator Kennedy's
legislation is the best hope yet for getting America out of the Iraq
quagmire. Every Senator -- especially those who would be president --
should support it," Matzzie added. </p>
