<p>NEW YORK - January 9 - Under
the banner of &quot;America Says NO to More Troops! End the War!&quot; the antiwar
movement will launch a national surge of protest within 24 hours of Bush's
announcement of plans to send more troops to Iraq. United
for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), the
nation's largest grassroots antiwar coalition, is working with Win Without War
to organize a wave of local protests in response to the President's announcement.
Bush is expected to announce his plans to send more troops to Iraq during
a televised speech on Wednesday, January 10.</p>


<p>&quot;It's unbelievable that after the voters, the soldiers,
and the Iraqis said they want an end to this war, President Bush is going to
escalate it,&quot; said Leslie Cagan, UFPJ
National Coordinator. &quot;Bush was wrong to begin the war in March 2003 and he's
wrong to prolong it even one more day. The way out of the mess is to bring the
troops back home now, not send more of them to die and kill needlessly in this
outrageous war.&quot;</p>


<p>On Saturday, January 27th, the peace surge will escalate
with a major national march on Washington to push
Congress to listen to the voters, not Bush, and bring the war to a close.
Organized by United for Peace and Justice, the weekend's activities will
include an interfaith peace service and a Congressional Education Day on
Monday, January 29th.</p>


<p>Anne Roesler, a UFPJ
spokesperson and member of Military Families Speak Out, said, &quot;With
each of his three deployments, my son
said that he witnessed increasing chaos and a country on the brink of
civil
war. Escalating the war won't solve
these issues. The Bush Administration
tried increasing troop levels in October 2005 to 'clear, hold, and
build' in Iraq. It didn't work then, and it won't work now. With more
than 3,000 U.S. troops dead, over 20,000 injured, countless
others suffering from serious mental health disorders, and tens of
thousands of
innocent Iraqis dead, it's time to bring all the troops home -- not to
deploy more.&quot;</p>

Bush's announcement, visit <a mce_href="http://www.americasaysno.org/" href="http://www.americasaysno.org/">http://www.americasaysno.org</a>.<u> </u></p>
