<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 -Andrew Jay Schwartzman, President and CEO, and Harold Feld, Senior Vice President of Media Access Project, issued the following statement regarding the FCC’s decision on cable leased access and “70/70:”
<P></P>
“At the end of the day, literally and figuratively, the cable industry's mighty lobbying machine could not entirely stop Chairman Martin's commendable effort to introduce competition to the pay-TV industry. The new leased access rules offer the hope of vastly increased diversity in cable programming sources. And, since it has long argued that the FCC should collect its own data rather than relying on private sources, MAP could hardly quarrel with the FCC's long over due determination to do just that. However, MAP believes that even the existing data strongly support a “70/70” finding, and there is no need to await further data collection before making that declaration.”
<P></P>
“If there were any doubt about the awesome political clout exercised by the cable industry, the last few weeks have demonstrated that armies of lobbyists and buckets of money can twist facts and cajole even well-meaning politicians into doing things that clearly harm their constituents. The fight over “70/70” and leased access is a textbook example of why we need transparency and accountability in the regulatory process.”
<P></P>
“Amid all the rhetoric, it is easy to overlook the central finding of the Commission’s annual video report. As in the past, the Commission found that cable “prices continue to out pace the general level of inflation.” This is the direct result of the cable industry’s exercise of market power.”
<P></P>
“Apologists for the cable industry point to new sources of competition. MAP certainly welcomes DBS and telephone company competition, but the Commission has found that, as of now, these newer entrants have increased programming choices somewhat, but have been unable to provide consumers with the benefits of price competition. Nor have these competing outlets provided sufficient revenue to support independent programming channels; that is why MAP is disappointed that the Commission has yet to adopt “program access” reforms.”
<P></P>
“While MAP is disappointed that the “70/70” fight will continue for many more months, it is quite pleased that local, independent programmers and low power TV stations will now benefit from reduced cable access rates and an end to cable’s obstructionist tactics.”</P>
