<p>    WASHINGTON, DC - September 28 - League of Women Voters President Mary G. Wilson today urged President Bush to sign the crucial reauthorization of the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP) mere days before it is set to expire. Legislation reauthorizing SCHIP, a program that provides healthcare for our country’s most vulnerable children, passed both chambers of Congress this week. 
<p></p>
“A veto against SCHIP is a veto against our future,” said Wilson. “For ten years, SCHIP has made quality healthcare a reality for over six million poor and uninsured children.  The President cannot in good conscience put an end to this crucial program.” 
<p></p>
“A vast bipartisan coalition of lawmakers have renewed their commitment to future generations of Americans,” Wilson continued.  “The White House must follow suit, and sign this legislation when it crosses the President’s desk.”
<p></p>
The League of Women Voters has long supported the concept of universal access to quality health care, and works to ensure that all children should have access to quality health care including preventive and primary care and that programs like SCHIP play a key role in promoting the health, well being and full development of children. <br>
