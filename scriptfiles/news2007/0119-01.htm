<p>WASHINGTON - January 19 - Rather than engage in a politically charged debate every year about funding for water pipes and treatment plants around the country, Congress should protect America’s water by establishing a trust fund that provides a designated revenue stream.

<p>The United States has a growing population and aging water system. And yet, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, the primary source of federal funds for wastewater projects, has actually decreased from $1.35 billion in 2004 to less than $700 million proposed for 2007. Congress must approve a dramatic increase in this critical funding.

<p>Congress must also recognize that an annual political battle over funding for something as basic as water makes no sense.   National priorities that transcend state and local boundaries should receive perpetual funding streams, immune from shifting political currents.

<p>The National Botanic Garden has a trust fund to protect the Texas Prickly Pear and the Butterfly Weed.  There is a South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Restoration Trust Fund.  And there are trust funds for highways, airports and social security.  

<p>Water is a public responsibility.  It’s time for a trust fund that protects our water and keeps it clean and safe.
