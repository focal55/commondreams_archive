<p>New York, NY-- Planned Parenthood today
condemned the Supreme Court's decision in Gonzalez v. Carhart, the chilling
first ever federal ban on an abortion method without an exception for
women's health.
    <P></P>"The American public should be absolutely outraged by this
unprecedented and dangerous intrusion into the private relationship between
a woman and her doctor," said Joan Malin, President and CEO of Planned
Parenthood of New York City. "Today five men with a gavel -- two of whom
were handpicked by George W. Bush -- decided that they know more about
medicine than do doctors. We have never before seen such a politically
motivated and unwarranted invasion into the private relationship between a
woman and her doctor."
   <P></P> In 2003 President Bush signed the Federal Abortion Ban into law. This
ban, which outlaws some of the safest abortions as early as 12 to 15 weeks
with no provision to protect a woman's health, was immediately challenged
by Planned Parenthood and struck down by six separate courts, all of which
agreed that it unconstitutionally failed to protect women's health. The
Bush administration pursued the ban to the Supreme Court where it was heard
on November 8, 2006 by a new court, including his two handpicked
appointees. Today, the Bush Court shockingly upheld this ban, outlawing a
safe, common abortions method even when woman's health is in jeopardy.
   <P></P> This stunning decision, which defies both common sense and established
law, firmly places politicians and the Supreme Court into the middle of
private health care decisions. It is abundantly clear that the Court has
joined the Bush administration and is willing to support laws that
interfere with medical decisions even when they jeopardize a woman's
health.
    <P></P>"Planned Parenthood will comply with the law," states Joan Malin. "But
our doors are not closed. Abortion is still safe and it is still legal and
we are firmly committed to providing health services, including abortion,
without interruption. We are here today and I pledge my word that we will
be here tomorrow."<!-- #EndEditable -->
