<p>Capital Police arrested a 26 year veteran of the United States Army and Reserve as she quietly exited the House Judiciary committee hearing on the "FBI's Use of National Security Letters." Retired Colonel Ann Wright voiced opposition to the committee's lack of oversight  before being asked leave by Rep. John Conyers, House
Judiciary Chair.   As Wright left the hearing room, Conyers asked
Capital Police to escort her out.   Despite orders from Conyers not to
arrest her,  Capital Police officers arrested her for exercising her first amendment rights.  She is being processed at the D Street Station but has not been notified of any charges.


This is the second times in less than a week that a citizen opposing the Iraq war in Congress was subject to a random arrest.  Last Thursday,  CODEPINK Co-Founder Gael Murphy and two other CODEPINK members were arrested outside the House Appropriations Committee hearing.  As documented on YOUTUBE, Capital Police aggressively arrested Murphy and prevented citizens from attending the hearing on the Supplemental Funding for the Iraq War.</P>
<P>Retired Colonel Wright served for 26 years in Army and the Army Reserves and served 15 years in the Diplomatic Corp. She received the State Department's Award for Heroism as Charge d'Affaires during the evacuation of Sierra Leone in 1997.  She resigned from her post as Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in 2003 due to her opposition to the war on Iraq.  In her letter of resignation to then Secretary of State Colin Powell  Wright explained, "I have served my country for almost thirty years in the some of the most isolated and dangerous parts of the world. I want to continue to serve America. However, I do not believe in the policies of this Administration and cannot defend or implement them. It is with heavy heart that I must end my service to America and therefore resign due to the Administration's policies".</P>
