<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 7 - “Yesterday Congress had the opportunity to address the global water crisis with the Water for the World Resolution (H. Con. Res. 266). Water is an essential resource that should be clean, safe, and affordable for all people, regardless of income and economic constraints. The resolution recognizes the importance of this, and calls on Congress to provide necessary U.S. funding to ensure the world’s poor will have access to this vital resource.
<p></p>

“As many as 1.4 billion people struggle daily to obtain access to an adequate water supply, while 2.5 billion lack access to improved sanitation. According to the World Health Organization, increasing pollution levels and a global water consumption rate that doubles every 20 years will cause 48 nations to face severe water shortages by 2025.
<p></p>
Our country cannot continue to ignore this pending international public health and environmental crisis.
<p></p>

“Government policies should ensure that all individuals have equitable access to water to meet basic human needs. With the Water for the World Resolution, Congress can choose to recognize water as a basic human right, one that should be protected as a public trust and global public good.”
<p></p>

“We encourage Congress to follow suit with countries that have already proclaimed water a human right, and work for a solution that will help alleviate the world’s water troubles.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
