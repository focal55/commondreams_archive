                    O'Sullivan will meet with Vanderbilt University workers at
                    Safe Haven Family Shelter, 1234 3rd Avenue South,
                    Nashville, a homeless shelter where one employee lives.

                    Activities, Gaylord Opryland Hotel, 2800 Opryland Drive,

      <p>  2:15 p.m.   Danny Glover and Laborers' President Terry O'Sullivan meet
                    with Vanderbilt employees as they clock in and out for
                    work at Vanderbilt Peabody College, just north of 18th
                    Street and Edgehill Avenue.

       <p> 4 p.m.      Town Hall meeting with Vanderbilt University workers,
                    students, community leaders, Danny Glover and Terry
                    O'Sullivan, at Scarritt Bennett Center, Wightman Chapel,
                    1008 19th Avenue South, Nashville.
   <p> Vanderbilt workers, many of them members of Laborers' Local Union 386,
have been struggling since last year to achieve a living wage, which in
Nashville is $10.18 per hour. Currently, Vanderbilt's lowest paid workers
earn about $7.55 an hour, well below the poverty level. Yet Vanderbilt --
whose chancellor is paid $1.2 million a year -- continues to refuse to
grant a living wage for employees.
