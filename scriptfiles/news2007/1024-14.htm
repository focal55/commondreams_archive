<p>WASHINGTON - October 24 - Following the release of an independent review of contractor behavior In Iraq, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today applauded many of the proposed changes but warned that implementation should not be delayed.
<P></P>
After private security contractors from Blackwater USA allegedly shot Iraqi civilians, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for an independent review of the State Department’s policies on personal protective services contractors. Today, that review panel issued a list of nineteen recommendations to improve current security protocols with regard to State Department-hired contractors. CIVIC believes three of these recommendations are crucial and should be immediately implemented, including: establishing clear laws to hold contractors accountable under US law, establishing an Embassy Joint Incident Review Board to review all incidents involving the use of deadly force, and requiring the US Embassy to actively seek out and compensate Iraqi civilians suffering injuries, loss of a family member, or damages to property.
<P></P>
“These recommendations to the State Department are right on-target. They reign in contractors and would help civilians harmed by their behavior – a crucial effort overlooked since the start of the Iraq War,” says Sarah Holewinski, CIVIC’s Executive Director. “The sooner these policies are up and running, the better.”
<P></P>
The US military has the ability to pay a symbolic condolence to Iraqis it unintentionally harms and, separately, can give full compensation to civilians wrongfully or negligently hurt by American soldiers. CIVIC noted that while that system is not perfect, US agencies hiring armed contractors have made no such effort to compensate Iraqis suffering losses. Says Holewinski, “that’s a long-standing oversight that’s unfair and strategically unwise.” CIVIC called on the State Department to take seriously the recommendation by the independent panel and create its own fair, equitable process for civilians to file claims following harm caused by contractors.
<P></P>
“The State Department has the chance to step up as a leader among US agencies here,” says Holewinski. “As the face of American values around the world, appropriately compensating civilians is smart and happens to be the right thing to do.”

 <em>CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and helped by the warring parties involved. In 2005, CIVIC's founder Marla Ruzicka was killed in Iraq by suicide bomb. CIVIC honors her legacy and strives to sustain her vision.</em><!-- #EndEditable -->
