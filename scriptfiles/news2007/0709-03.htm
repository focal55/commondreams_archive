<p>NEW MEXICO - JULY 9 -   In the weeks leading up to 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's most recent shooting of an endangered 
Mexican gray wolf last Thursday, hundreds of scientists warned the agency that 
its unprecedented level of killing and removing wolves was undermining the wolf 
recovery program and pushing the species toward a catastrophic genetic 
bottleneck.<br><br>The scientists were ignored, and on July 5, 2007, over the 
objections of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, the federal agent 
killed a female wolf with pups. The incident provoked a strong reaction from New 
Mexico Governor and presidential candidate Bill Richardson, who has initiated a 
criminal investigation and called on the Bush administration to suspend its 
wolf-killing policy pending reform.<br><br>In addition to the 11 wolves shot by 
government agents since 2003, 20 have died due to accidents in the agency's 
recapture program, and 22 survived capture but have been permanently removed 
from the wild. In all, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Service's politically 
dominated program has killed or permanently removed 53 wolves since it inception 
in 1998. That nearly equals the total number of Mexican gray wolves remaining in 
the wild today: 55.<br><br>"The greatest threat to the Mexican gray wolf today 
is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service," said Michael Robinson of the Center for 
Biological Diversity. "The Bush administration has turned the agency into a 
wolf-killing machine. No wolves were shot by government agents until 2003; 
killings escalated to five in 2006 and are already at three this year. 2007 is 
on a trajectory to become another record killing year."<br><br>On June 28, 2007, 
nine scientists, including retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Mexican Wolf 
Recovery Coordinator David Parsons, complained to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service that the recovery program has missed its goal of 102 wolves by nearly 50 
percent. They blamed the failure on the high level of killing and removal by 
federal<br>agents: "For the past four years growth of the [Mexican gray] wolf 
population has been limited by management-related killing or permanent removal 
of wolves."<br><br>Other authors included Dr. Phil Hedrick, member of the 
Mexican gray wolf recovery team, and Dr. Paul Paquet of the University of 
Calgary, lead author of the government-authorized Mexican Wolf Three-Year 
Review.<br><br>The scientists complained that the government has killed or 
removed some of the most genetically important wolves, including the killing of 
the "genetically irreplaceable" Saddle Pack alpha male in 2004 and more recent 
removal of the alpha pair of the Saddle pack and their seven pups.<br><br>They 
"urge[d] the USFWS to take immediate actions that will result in at least a 15% 
annual growth rate of the wild population until the objective of at least 100 
wolves is met and to expedite management actions necessary to protect and 
maximize the genetic diversity of the wild population…and to expedite a rule 
change that will meet the "conservation" mandate of the Endangered Species 
Act.<br><br>Very similar points were made on June 10th, 2006, by the almost 600 
attendees of the annual meeting of the American Society of Mammalogists. The 
Society unanimously passed a resolution calling on the Fish and Wildlife Service 
"to suspend all predator control directed at Mexican gray wolves at least until 
the interim 100-wolf goal of the current reintroduction program has been 
achieved… to protect wolves from the consequences of scavenging on livestock 
carcasses, ensure the recovery and sustainability of populations of Mexican gray 
wolves, and allow wolves to roam freely throughout the Southwest."<br><br>The 
American Society of Mammalogists was founded in 1919 and is the world's oldest 
and largest organization devoted to the scientific study of mammals.<br><br>The 
Center for Biological Diversity is a nonprofit conservation organization with 
more than 35,000 members dedicated to the protection of endangered species and 
wild places.<br>
