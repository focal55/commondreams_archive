<p>NEW YORK - January 18 - Americans angered by Bush's plans to
escalate the </b><b>Iraq</b><b> war will flood the streets of </b><b>Washington</b><b> on Saturday, January 27, in a massive national
peace march organized by United for Peace and Justice (</b><b>UFPJ</b><b>). </b>Marchers will call on Congress
to listen to the voters, not Bush, by using its power to end Bush's war and
bring the troops home. The last three national marches organized by UFPJ each
attracted between 300,000 and 500,000 people.</p>


<p>MoveOn.org has called upon its 3.2 million members to join
UFPJ, describing the march as
potentially a "turning point for the war" comparable to how "Martin Luther King
Jr.'s March on Washington in 1963
was a turning point in the fight for equality and civil rights." The National
Organization for Women (N.O.W.) is mobilizing its chapters to participate.
Local antiwar groups in cities and towns across the nation are mobilizing.</p>


<p>On Monday, United for Peace and Justice's website received
more than 700,000 hits. District Council 37 in NYC, A.F.S.C.M.E.'s largest
district council, and New York's
United Federation of Teachers, the largest teachers union local in the country,
are sending busloads of their members to Washington. Car
caravans and peace trains are heading to Washington, DC, from
all over the East Coast, Midwest and Southeast. Buses and vans are coming from more than 30 states and 111 cities, including
from as far away as Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.</p>


<p>Judith LeBlanc, UFPJ
Co-Chairperson, said, "Bush's announcement of plans to escalate the war has
backfired. Every day people call or send email to say they will be marching in Washington with
United for Peace and Justice on January 27th to call for an end to this war. They
are demanding that Congress stand up to Bush. There is no doubt: This is the
right action at the right time."</p>


<p>Among those slated to speak at the pre-march rally are
Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson, who last year led an antiwar march of
thousands, the largest protest in Salt Lake City history; Reverend Jesse
Jackson, Jr.; Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH); Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA); Bob Watada,
father of Lt. Watada, the first military officer to refuse deployment to Iraq and
currently facing court-martial; and active-duty service people.</p>


<p>On Monday, January 29th, UFPJ is
sponsoring a Grassroots Lobby Day, in which hundreds will press the case for
withdrawal from Iraq
directly with their Congressional Representatives and Senators. The weekend's
activities will include a Saturday morning interfaith peace service and
organizing workshops on Sunday.</p>


<p>On Thursday, January 11, United for Peace and Justice
member groups and allies staged more than 1,000 local protests of Bush's
escalation of the Iraq war. UFPJ's March
on Washington is the
next step in the antiwar movement's national surge of opposition to Bush's
escalation of the war.</p>
