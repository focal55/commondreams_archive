<p>WASHINGTON - September 14 - Women from throughout the United States will gather to demand an end
to the Iraq war, then join with tens of thousands of people at the
ANSWER anti-war march.
<P></P>
<strong>WHEN:</strong> Saturday, September 15, 2007, 10:30 AM
<P></P>
<strong>WHERE:</strong> Women's Convergence at Freedom Plaza (Pennsylvania Ave between
13th & 14th NW), then join the rally/march starting at the White House at noon
<P></P>
<strong>VISUALS:</strong> Thousands of women dressed in pink, carrying anti-war signs
and banners and wearing pink boas, wigs and other pink accessories.
<P></P>
<strong>WHAT:</strong> The rally, sponsored by the national women's peace group
CODEPINK, will draw thousands of women from throughout the United
States, most of them dressed in the group's signature color, pink.
After the rally, the women will join up with the tens of thousands of
people participating in the ANSWER anti-war march.
<P></P>
"The people of this country are disgusted with this war, with the
President and with Congress," said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of
CODEPINK and the human rights group Global Exchange. "We will be
marching to demand that our elected officials to start listening to
the people and bring our troops home."
<P></P>
CODEPINK is the national women's peace group that has most recently
garnered international attention when its members "disrupted" General
Petraeus' report on Iraq. Started in the lead-up to the Iraq war,
CODEPINK has inspired thousands of women throughout the United States
and the world to make the color pink synonymous with political rabble
rousing.
<P></P>
CODEPINK's co-founders and several of its members have traveled to
Iraq and witnessed first-hand the tragedy of the war there. The Iraq
war has so far lasted longer than World War II and cost more than the
Vietnam War. It has taken the lives of 3,776 US soldiers and caused
the injuries of more than 50,000 others (<a href="http://www.icasualties.org" target="_new">http://www.icasualties.org</a>/).
A November 2006 study by Johns Hopkins University researchers found
that an astonishing 655,000 Iraqis have died since the US invaded Iraq
in 2003.
<P></P>
The women's peace rally is sponsored by CODEPINK and cosponsored by
V-Day, Institute for Policy Study, Coalition Against Sanctions and
Military Intervention in Iran, and the National Congress of Black
Women .<!-- #EndEditable -->
