<p>WASHINGTON - On Thursday, April 26th at 12:00 noon, as Congress debates and votes on their Supplemental War Spending bill that provides continued funding for the Iraq War, members of Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW), and Veterans For Peace (VFP), will gather in the Hart Senate Office Building Atrium to read letters to Congress written by military and Gold Star families. The letters call on Congress to end funding for the war in Iraq and fund the safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops and the care they need when they get home. Following the reading of letters, families and Veterans will visit the offices of Senators and Members of Congress. They will also be available for interview.
