<p>WASHINGTON - December 10 -  <strong>What</strong>: On International Human Rights Day, the human rights group CODEPINK: Women for Peace will stage a protest at the White House and then at the Pakistani Embassy.
<P></P>

<strong>When and Where:</strong> Monday, December 10
3:30pm at the White House.
5pm at the Pakistani Embassy, 3517 International Ct NW, Washington DC (Van Ness metro stop)
<P></P>
<strong>Why:</strong> On a day when people all over the world will be calling on governments to respect human rights and international law, CODEPINK will be highlighting the ongoing violations of human rights by the US government and the Pakistani government.
 <P></P>
"Sadly, our country has become a major human rights violator," says retired diplomat and Colonel Ann Wright. "Our government has been responsible for torture in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo, and for using extraordinary rendition to send detainees to countries that torture. This is totally unacceptable and we have to hold government accountable—especially on International Human Rights Day."
 <P></P>
The group will also be visiting the Pakistani Embassy to protest the beatings and jailing of human rights activists there, as well as the kidnapping and deportation of two U.S. CODEPINK activists Medea Benjamin and Tighe Barry. "Since the imposition of Emergency Rule on November 3, Pervez Musharraf has fired Supreme Court judges, beaten and jailed lawyers, and muzzled the press," says Benjamin. "We call on the Pakistani government to respect the right of its own people as well as visitors like us, who were kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to leave the country." <!-- #EndEditable -->
