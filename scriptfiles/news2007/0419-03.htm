<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>BROOKLYN, N.Y.--TreeHugger.com, the
leading pure environmental website, in its ongoing effort to celebrate
everyday as Earth Day, along with Seventh Generation (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.inspiredprotagonist.com">www.inspiredprotagonist.com</a>),
the leading eco-friendly home products company, are thrilled to announce
that celebrity guest judge, Ed Begley, Jr. has chosen the winners of
Convenient Truths video contest (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.truths.treehugger.com">www.truths.treehugger.com</a>). As
a follow-up to Al Gore's Oscar winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth,
the mission of the contest was to empower "ordinary" people to create
videos that demonstrate simple and effective solutions to reducing carbon
emissions.<br>
<br>
The former Vice President, Al Gore, "applauds TreeHugger's efforts"
calling the contest "a great way to spread the word and bring the issue
into our daily lives."<br>
<br>
Now that the Convenient Truths contest is over, the videos submissions
will keep citizens motivated to take action. This Earth Day (and everyday)
viewers have access to over one-hundred and thirty, 1-2 minute video
submissions addressing everyday solutions to climate change. Topics range
from solar energy to public transportation to composting and more. The
videos are smart, slick, upbeat, and energetic.<br>
<br>
The winning videos have been chosen by a combination of web viewers and
expert judges including Ed Begley Jr., Actor and Environmentalist; Laurie
David, Founder of stopglobalwarming.org; and Dr. Heidi Cullen, Climate
Expert, The Weather Channel. (To see the full list go here.) The winners
will receive close to $30,000 in sustainable prizes. Videos are served by
blip.tv (www.blip.tv) and will be broadcast on various outlets including
One Degree, a broadband site dedicated to climate change developed by The
Weather Channel Interactive (TWCI) and distributed on DVD by Ironweed
Films.<br>

<b>About Seventh Generation:</b><br>
<br>
Seventh Generation is committed to becoming the world's most trusted brand
of authentic, safe, and environmentally responsible products for a healthy
home. For 18 years, the closely held Burlington, Vermont company has been
at the forefront of a cultural change in consumer behavior and business
ethics. One of the country's first self-declared "socially responsible"
companies, Seventh Generation is a business that operates according to a
new and different set of principles and values that in many ways are a
marked departure from those long considered "traditional." Its business
practice is focused on offering people avenues to express their idealism,
passion, and commitment to causes larger than themselves at every point
along its supply chain -- from suppliers and partners to shareholders,
customers and its own staff.<br>
<br>
The company derives its name from the Great Law of the Iroquois that
states, In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our
decisions on the next seven generations. For more information, visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com">www.seventhgeneration.com</a> or
