<p>WASHINGTON - January 9 - Within 24 hours of
President Bush's announcement of an escalation of troops in Iraq, citizens
around the country will hold events and upload personal YouTube appeals and
photos calling on their member of Congress to say "No!" to the President's
new plan. It is the first in a series of coordinated protest actions being
planned for January and February.
  <p>  Participants have begun to download "NO!" signs, and to circulate
petitions urging Congress to exercise it's power of the purse to block any
escalation of the war in Iraq, while providing sufficient funds for a safe
and secure exit for U.S. troops in 2007. They are preparing to do battle in
Congress over the President's request for supplemental funds to ensure that
no money can be used to increase U.S. troop levels in Iraq.
 <p>   The President's willful disregard of last November's mandate to get
U.S. troops out of Iraq will ignite a series of events which, in addition
to the "NO!" campaign, will include a massive protest march in Washington,
D.C., on January 27th (organized by United for Peace and Justice), a
follow-up lobby day on January 29th at the Capitol, and a "Meet-up with
your Member Day" at Congressional District offices in February.
   <p> The President is expected to call for an escalation of troops in a
prime- time address to the nation tonight, which sharply conflicts with the
sentiment of the majority of Americans according to recent polls and the
mid-term election results.
   <p> The campaign is led by former Member of Congress and National Director
of Win Without War, Tom Andrews. Win Without War is the nation's largest
antiwar coalition.
   <p> The YouTube action is part of a larger campaign organized by Win
Without War and led by coalition partner TrueMajority to pressure the
President and Congress to exit Iraq.<!-- #EndEditable -->
