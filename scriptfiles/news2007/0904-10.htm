<p>NEW YORK - September 4 - According to a report just released by the <a href="http://www.southernstudies.org/" target="_new" class="msfCOPYBOLDLINK">Institute for Southern Studies</a>, and supported in part by the <a href="http://www.ms.foundation.org/">Ms. Foundation for Women</a>, community-based women’s organizations—led primarily by low-income women and women of color—have emerged as key actors in igniting successful recovery and rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast. </p>
<p>

For its new report, “<a href="http://www.southernstudies.org/" target="_new" class="msfCOPYBOLDLINK">Blueprint for Gulf Renewal: The Katrina Crisis and a Community Agenda for Action</a>,” the Institute for Southern Studies’ Gulf Coast Reconstruction Watch interviewed 40 community-based organizations, a quarter of which were grantees of the Ms. Foundation’s <a href="wmspage.cfm?parm1=294" class="msfCOPYBOLDLINK">Katrina Women’s Response Fund</a>. In conversations with the Institute, grassroots women leaders offered key policy recommendations for a just and sustainable renewal, which now comprise the report’s action agenda.

</p><p>
<b>“Much of the report’s blueprint for a sustainable and equitable renewal is based on the highly-informed, strategic suggestions of grassroots women leaders—many of them Ms. Foundation grantees—who are already driving significant change in their communities,” says Chris Kromm, Executive Director of the Institute for Southern Studies and co-author of the report. </b>
</p><p>
Since the storms, women, who were disproportionately affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, have been proving that they are uniquely positioned to generate effective strategies to ensure quick and lasting relief throughout the Gulf Coast. For example, Ms. Foundation grantees Sharon Hanshaw of Coastal Women for Change and Brenda Dardar Robichaux of the United Houma Nation Relief Fund—both of whom were highlighted in the Institute’s report—are holding public and private actors accountable and making critical strides on behalf of their families and communities in the region. </p><p>

Sharon Hanshaw, a salon owner for 20 years until Katrina hit, formed Coastal Women for Change (CWC) in January 2006 to ensure low-income women and women of color had a voice in the rebuilding process. CWC has since spearheaded organizing around issues of fair housing and affordable child care and successfully pushed for greater representation of women of color on the Biloxi mayoral planning commission. Brenda Dardar Robichaux, Principal Chief of the United Houma Nation in Southeastern Louisiana, formed the United Houma Nation Relief Fund after Katrina and Rita to mobilize resources and support for over 5,000 tribal members displaced and affected by the storms. Two years later, the Fund continues to provide vital community services such as training for women in non-traditional careers like construction to support their re-entry into the region’s reconfigured workforce. </p><p>
<b>
“The Katrina Women’s Response Fund reflects our belief that it is crucial to elevate the voices and leadership of low-income women and women of color if we are ever to ensure a just, sustainable recovery and address long-standing problems of race and poverty in the Gulf Coast,” says Sara K. Gould, President and CEO of the Ms. Foundation. </b>
</p><p>

The Ms. Foundation for Women formed the Katrina Women’s Response Fund immediately after the storms to offer critical, ongoing support for women’s grassroots leadership and to ensure the full participation of low-income women and women of color in policy-making arenas. <b>By September 2007, the Ms Foundation will have provided over $2 million in strategic support to 40 community-based organizations in the Gulf Coast.</b> 

</p><p>
Despite their many successes, Ms. Foundation grantees (who are available for interviews) report that there are still serious unmet needs among women and families in their communities. As they share in the Institute for Southern Studies report, an effective blueprint for renewal must include government commitments to: fully fund school reconstruction needs, special education mandates and alternative and transitional schools; save public housing from replacement by mixed-income units (prior to the storms, 88 percent of New Orleans public housing was occupied by women-headed households); and protect workers’ rights—particularly those of immigrants who have been subject to wage theft by abusive contractors. 
</p><p>
<b> “By highlighting the vital, dynamic organizing of community-based organizations in the Gulf Coast, the Institute for Southern Studies report amplifies the voices of grassroots women leaders who continue to demand justice for their communities,” offers Sara K. Gould. “In doing so, the report teaches us a crucial lesson: these are the women who hold the solutions and the leaders to whom we should be listening.”  </b></p><p>
