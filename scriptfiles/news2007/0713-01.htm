<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 13 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement following his vote against HR 2956, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act.</p>

<p align="left">"We've lost over 3,600 of our brave service men and women. An estimated one million innocent Iraqis have perished in the war. We're now telling Iraqis, whose country the U.S. destroyed, whose reconstruction funds the U.S. mishandled, whose social networks have been shredded: Stand on your own feet! We try to steal their oil under the cover of occupation," Kucinich said in a debate on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives today. </p>

<p align="left">"This bill will not end the war. This bill will not end the occupation.<u> It doesn't take a vote to end this war. We must inform the Administration that the $97 billion appropriated last month is the end of the financing for the war</u>. </p>

<p align="left">"Use the money that's in the pipeline through October 1 to bring the troops home. Compel the President to put together an international peacekeeping and security force which would move in as our troops leave.</p>

<p align="left">"We could have our troops home by October 1. The question is whether we are ready to take a stand to do that, or whether we are going to vote on resolutions that give the American people the appearance that we want to end the war, without actually addressing the central issue that<script><!--
