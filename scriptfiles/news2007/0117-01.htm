<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - &ldquo;We commend New Jersey
Senators Lautenberg and Menendez, who are original co-sponsors of the
legislation, for introducing this visionary bill to solve one of the greatest
challenges facing the U.S. and world.&nbsp;
This is a comprehensive, science-based bill that would harness America&rsquo;s
technological know-how to reduce global warming pollution, while ushering in a
new energy future,&rdquo; said Environment New Jersey Global Warming and Clean Energy
Advocate Suzanne Leta Liou.&nbsp; 
<p class="MsoNormal">Climate scientists warn that
the world faces dire consequences unless we immediately and significantly
reduce emissions of the pollutants that cause global warming.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The Global Warming Pollution
Reduction Act, first introduced last July by now-retired Senator Jim Jeffords
(I-VT), would reduce U.S. emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 (a 15% reduction
from today&rsquo;s levels) and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. &nbsp;To achieve these emission reductions, the bill
calls for a greater reliance on clean, renewable energy and improved energy
efficiency.&nbsp; </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The bill mirrors the New
Jersey Global Warming Response Act (A3301/S2114), sponsored by Assemblywoman
Linda Stender (D-22) and Senator Barbara Buono (D-18), requiring statewide
emissions reductions to below 1990 levels by 2020 (about a 20% reduction from
New Jersey&rsquo;s emissions levels today).&nbsp;
Environment New Jersey is urging all members of the state legislature to
co-sponsor this legislation and is also calling on Governor Corzine to issue an
Executive Order to reduce statewide emissions by 80% by 2050 and develop a plan
to start cutting emissions right away.&nbsp; </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;By investing now in energy
efficiency and clean, renewable energy, we can cut our global warming emissions,
while reducing our dependence on scarce fossil fuels and, in many cases,
creating jobs and saving money. &nbsp;The
result would be a cleaner, more sustainable foundation on which to build
America&rsquo;s economy for the 21st century,&rdquo; said Leta Liou.&nbsp; </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The original co-sponsors
include Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Barbara Boxer (D-CA)m Daniel Akaka
(D-HI), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Frank
Lautenberg (D-NJ), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Jack Reed (D-RI),
and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).&nbsp;
Co-sponsors of the New Jersey Global Warming Response Act (A3301/S2114)
are Asw. Linda Greenstein (D-14), Asw. Vainieri-Huttle (D-37), Asm. Reed
Gusciora (D-15) and Senator Tom Kean (R-11).&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
