<p>WASHINGTON, DC - December 6 - Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following statement about yesterday’s tragic shooting in Omaha, Nebraska: <br>
<br>
<em> “Our sympathies and prayers go to the families of the eight who died and the five who were wounded in yesterday’s mall shooting in Omaha.<br>
<br>
“Having an SKS rifle and high-capacity ammunition clips enabled a troubled young man to kill and injure a large number of people quickly and efficiently.&nbsp; Allowing the easy acquisition and possession of military-style weapons like this is foolhardy and the results are tragic. <br>
<br>
“We need to find out how and where the killer got this gun and this ammunition. We need to stop selling military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips to civilians. The killer knew what he was going to do, and he knew what tools he needed.&nbsp; Our weak gun laws make these killing machines readily available.&nbsp; We can take steps to prevent tragedies like this in the future.”</em>  <br>

<br>
