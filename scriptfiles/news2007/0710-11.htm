<p>WASHINGTON  - JULY 10 - Following President Bush's town hall meeting from Cleveland, Ohio, today, Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) released the following statement: </p>

<p align="left">"The President has requested additional time for his Iraq strategy. Time for what? Time to&nbsp;privatize&nbsp;Iraq's oil?&nbsp;Time to&nbsp;change the subject with an attack on Iran?&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress must act to end this war and end it now.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">"We must tell the President NO to any additional funding.&nbsp;No legislation is required.&nbsp; No vote is required.&nbsp;The only thing required is honesty, integrity and a willingness to end the war.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">"The war is based on lies.&nbsp;The President and the Vice President have no credibility whatsoever on matters relating to our national defense.&nbsp;They sent&nbsp;more than 3,600 of our brave men and women to their deaths.&nbsp;They are responsible for creating the conditions that have led to the deaths of an estimated one million innocent Iraqis. They have set in motion spending for Iraq which could top one trillion dollars. They now have three aircraft carriers in the Gulf (although some news reports claim that one carrier will leave the area), setting the stage for an attack on Iran.</p>

<p align="left">"What will it take for Congress to wake up and tell the American people the truth?&nbsp; We do not have to fund the war.&nbsp;We have the money to bring the troops home.&nbsp; It does not require a vote.&nbsp; It requires determination and truth,"&nbsp;Kucinich concluded.<!-- #EndEditable -->
