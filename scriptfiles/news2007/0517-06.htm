<p>Los Angeles - MAY 17 -During the last election, New York City was center stage in what is considered to be the most contentious political convention in recent history -- the 2004 Republican National Convention.  Thousands of activists descended upon the streets of New York to hold marches, rallies and demonstrations protesting President Bush, his administration and his agenda. Mora Stephens’ directorial debut, “Conventioneers,” explores the possibility of a bi-partisan relationship at a time when the country was as polarized as ever.  Along with Producer Joel Viertel, Stephens infiltrated both the convention and the surrounding protests to film a narrative Red State-Blue State love story.  Winner of the 2006 Independent Spirit Awards’ John Cassavetes Award, “Conventioneers” will be released on DVD June 19.

<P></P>Featuring breakthrough performances by newcomers, Matthew Mabe and Woodwyn Koons, “Conventioneers” follows DAVID MASSEY (Mabe), a Texas native and staunch Republican who comes to New York as a first-time delegate to the Republication National Convention and falls into an unlikely affair with LEA JONES (Koons), an old college friend who has returned to the City to protest the Bush agenda.  An ironic Romeo & Juliet story set against the real RNC, “Conventioneers” casts light on the widening gap between the political parties and the heated polarity that Americans experienced during the 2004 presidential election.  

 

<P></P>A second storyline centers on DYLAN MURTAUGH (Alek Friedman), a former protester who has dropped out of the scene because of his responsibilities as a husband and a new father.  He must confront his dedication to the cause when he is hired as a sign language interpreter for President Bush’s speech at the convention.  When he tells his activist friends about the job, they try to convince him to stage a protest during the speech instead.  Friedman, a real sign language interpreter, was actually hired to interpret for the President during the convention, which allowed the filmmakers to get real footage from inside Madison Square Garden.

 

<P></P>DVD extras include a behind the scenes featurette and "arrest shorts" detailing the experiences of the filmmakers when they got caught up in a sweep of protesters and were arrested. The disc also includes commentary tracks with the director, producer and cast, along with deleted scenes and alternate takes. 

 

            <P></P>“Conventioneers” received critical acclaim on the festival circuit including the 2006 Independent Spirit Awards’ John Cassavetes Award (for Best Feature made under $500,000) and the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2006 Florida Film Festival.  Early reviews have applauded Stephens’ filmmaking style and narrative approach, citing her ability to tell a passionate love story filled with intense drama and real life events.
