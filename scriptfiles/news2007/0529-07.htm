<p>MAY 29 - No one deserves a rest from the public eye and physical threats and media attacks than does Cindy Sheehan.  We wish her well as she steps back from public view.   Nobody has given more to the peace movement in recent years – emotionally, physically, spiritually.  And the warfare state took away her beloved son Casey.   

<P></P>At Progressive Democrats of America, we’d worked long and hard with Cindy well before she went to Crawford, Texas, to camp out near the President’s ranch.  That action helped re-ignite the antiwar movement.  It woke up the corporate media about grassroots opposition (including among military families and vets) to the Iraq war that many of these news outlets were complicit in.  

<P></P>Since then, we’ve traveled together nationwide organizing to bring our troops home from Iraq and for impeachment of Bush and Cheney.  We’ve lobbied together on Capitol Hill, and protested outside the White House.  PDA is proud to have Cindy Sheehan on our National Advisory Board. 

<P></P>We commit ourselves to redouble our efforts on behalf of Cindy and Casey and the 3440 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who’ve lost there lives in the wake of the disastrous invasion. 

<P></P>Cindy’s announcement is reverberating among progressives and in mainstream media.  I communicated with her yesterday.  

<P></P>Cindy, it is with deep gratitude and love that we thank you for all you have given.
