<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - January 23 - As the Senate takes up 
legislation to raise the minimum wage, business owners, executives and venture 
capitalists across the nation are telling Congress that a $5.15 minimum wage 
hurts business, workers and the economy.<BR>
<BR>
"People who tell you that 
raising the minimum wage will hurt small business are flat out full of it. Low 
minimum wages do NOT help small business," said Lew Prince, co-owner of Vintage 
Vinyl in St. Louis, MO, at a Senate news conference Friday.<BR>
<BR>
Ticking off 
the benefits of higher minimum wage for business, Mr. Prince said raising the 
minimum wage increases consumer buying power and much more. "Small business 
owners know that keeping workers is easier and cheaper than finding and training 
new ones," Mr. Prince said. "You get lower recruiting costs. You get lower 
training costs. You get decreased absenteeism and higher worker morale. Our 
long-term employees are way more likely to establish ongoing relationships with 
customers. And every small business owner knows that the longer an employee 
stays with you -- the more they know about your business and your customers, and 
the higher their productivity."<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Prince is one of hundreds of 
businesspeople who have signed the Business Owners and Executives for a Higher 
Minimum Wage statement released on Capitol Hill. Signatories come from a wide 
mix of businesses -- from apparel, books and restaurants to farming, 
construction and venture capitalism -- and organizations such as Small Business 
Majority, New Voice of Business, Social Venture Network and the U.S. Women's 
Chamber of Commerce.<BR>
<BR>
Signer Kirsten Poole, co-owner of Kirsten's Cafe and 
Dish Caterers in Silver Spring, MD, says, "Trying to save money by shortchanging 
my employees would be like skimping on ingredients. I'd lose more than I saved 
because of declining quality, service, reputation and customer base. You can't 
build a healthy business or a healthy economy on a miserly minimum 
wage."<BR>
<BR>
Contrary to what critics routinely predict, the business leaders' 
statement says, "States that have raised their minimum wages above the 
inadequate $5.15 federal level have had better employment and small business 
trends than the other states."<BR>
<BR>
"We're overdue for a minimum wage 
increase," says Shalon Hastings, owner of Taco del Sol in Helena, MT. "It's a 
sign of respect for our employees and the work they do for us as business 
owners."<BR>
<BR>
After a decade at $5.15 an hour, the statement says, "Minimum 
wage workers have less buying power than minimum wage workers had half a century 
ago. We cannot build a strong 21st century economy on a 1950s' wage 
floor."<BR>
<BR>
Adnan Durrani, president of Condor Ventures in Stamford, CT and 
venture partner in Blue Chip Venture Capital, says, "Congress should know the 
facts are very clear versus the misinformation that's been spread over the 
years. It is a sound business decision to increase the minimum wage. It 
increases sales. It increases employment. I have found that without exception in 
the successful ventures we've backed, providing sustainable living wages yielded 
direct increases in productivity, job satisfaction and brand loyalty from 
customers, all contributing to higher returns for investors and 
employers."<BR>
<BR>
The Business Owners and Executives for a Higher Minimum Wage 
statement appears below, along with signatories to date. Sign-On is continuing 
at http://www.businessforafairminimumwage.org/.<BR>
<BR>
Business Owners and 
Executives for a Higher Minimum Wage is a project of Business for Shared 
Prosperity in partnership with the Let Justice Roll &lt;www.letjusticeroll.org&gt; campaign to raise the minimum wage. Business for 
Shared Prosperity is a new network, in formation, of forward-thinking business 
owners, executives and investors committed to building enduring economic 
progress on a strong foundation of opportunity, equity and innovation.<BR>

BUSINESS OWNERS AND EXECUTIVES FOR A HIGHER 
MINIMUM WAGE<BR>
<BR>
We, the undersigned business owners and executives, support 
an increase in the minimum wage to benefit workers, business and our economy. We 
know that a minimum wage of $5.15 an hour is simply not enough for workers to 
afford necessities for themselves and their families. We know that a fair wage 
floor is essential to healthy businesses and communities, and enduring economic 
growth.<BR>
<BR>
We expect an increased minimum wage to provide a boost to local 
economies. Businesses and communities will benefit as low-wage workers spend 
their much-needed pay raises at businesses in the neighborhoods where they live 
and work.<BR>
<BR>
Higher wages benefit business by increasing consumer purchasing 
power, reducing costly employee turnover, raising productivity, and improving 
product quality, customer satisfaction and company reputation. In a recent 
National Consumers League survey, for example, 76 percent of American consumers 
said "how well a company treats/pays employees influences what they 
buy."<BR>
<BR>
States that have raised their minimum wages above the inadequate 
$5.15 federal level have had better employment and small business trends than 
the other states. Studies by the Fiscal Policy Institute and others show that in 
states with minimum wages above $5.15, the number of small businesses and the 
number of small business employees grew more than the other states -- contrary 
to what critics predicted. Likewise, after the last federal minimum wage 
increases in 1996 and 1997, the nation experienced lower unemployment, low 
inflation, robust growth and declining poverty rates.<BR>
<BR>
At $5.15 an hour, 
today's minimum wage workers have less buying power than minimum wage workers 
had half a century ago. We cannot build a strong 21st century economy on a 
1950s' wage floor. We cannot build a strong 21st century economy when more and 
more hardworking Americans struggle to make ends meet.<BR>
<BR>
A fair minimum 
wage shows we value both work and responsible businesses. A fair minimum wage is 
a sound investment in the future of our communities and our 
nation.<BR>
