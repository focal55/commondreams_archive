<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 - As Congress debates ways to slow the
      “revolving door” between Capitol Hill and K Street lobbying firms, the
      nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has added a new feature to its
      award-winning Web site, OpenSecrets.org, that profiles
      more than 6,400 individuals who have worked in both the federal government
      and the private sector.
      <p>Freely available to the public, the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving">Revolving
      Door Database</a> is the most
      comprehensive source to date for learning who’s who in the Washington
      influence industry, and for uncovering how these people’s government
      connections afford them privileged access to those in power. Users
      can see, for example, which federal regulators are now working for the
      industries they once oversaw and which lobbyists might be capitalizing on
      their past employment with congressional committees that award government
      contracts, subsidies, earmarked appropriations and tax breaks.
      <p>“There’s a backstory to every law,
      regulation and government contract, and OpenSecrets.org’s Revolving Door
      Database helps tell those stories,” said the Center’s Executive
      Director, Sheila Krumholz. “With the shift in power in Congress,
      Washington’s version of the NBA draft is underway right now. People are
      trading on their connections to score plum jobs, and sometimes that makes
      for cozy relationships between government and private interests that
      affect the rest of us.”</p>
      <p>About 70% of the individuals in the Revolving
      Door Database are registered lobbyists. The remainder currently work at
      law and public relations firms, industry trade associations or unions,
      where their jobs may entail lobbying, formally or informally. Although the
      movement between the public and private sectors is commonly described as a
      <i>revolving</i> door, the database demonstrates that the phenomenon could
      be more aptly described as a one-way exit. Nearly all of the individuals
      in the database currently work in the private sector following jobs in
      government, which are typically less lucrative.</p>
      <p>The people profiled in the Revolving Door
      Database have worked in approximately 1,200 congressional offices and more
      than 350 executive branch agencies and judicial courts. In the private
      sector, they have been employed by nearly 2,000 lobbying, law or public
      relations firms and other organizations.</p>
      <p>More individuals currently in the database have
      worked at the White House than anywhere else in government, from the Ford
      administration through the current Bush administration. After the White
      House and the House of Representatives, the federal agency with the most
      records in the database is the Federal Communications Commission. Often
      criticized for favoring the telecommunications industry over consumers and
      the public interest, the FCC has employed more than 100 individuals who
      now work in the private sector—many of them on telecom
      matters—according to lobbying disclosure reports and other sources. The
      FCC-connected individuals in OpenSecrets.org’s database range from
      former commissioners now lobbying for telecom companies to chiefs of FCC
      bureaus who have become telecom executives.</p>
      <p>Researchers at the Center for Responsive
      Politics compiled data for the Revolving Door site from a variety of
      sources. The primary source for the core data was Columbia Books’s
      comprehensive directory of federal lobbyists, <i>Washington
      Representatives</i>. CRP researchers combined that data with publicly
      available information, such as lobbying disclosure reports filed with the
      Senate Office of Public Records, and other resources. As with all
      databases on OpenSecrets.org, the Revolving Door will be continually
      refined, and the Center welcomes suggestions, corrections and tips by
      e-mail to <a href="mailto:revdoor@crp.org">revdoor@crp.org</a>.</p>
      <p>“The
      intent in this project is not to accuse individuals of benefiting from a
      conflict of interest,” said Tim La Pira, the database’s lead
      researcher. “We have identified relationships that we think the public
      should be aware of, and we leave it to our users to interpret what we’ve
      found.”
      <p>OpenSecrets.org’s Revolving Door Database was
      made possible by a grant to the Center for Responsive Politics from the
      Sunlight Foundation, which supports using new information technologies to
      ensure greater transparency and accountability by government, help reduce
      corruption and foster public trust in the institutions of democracy. The
      Sunlight Foundation also funded three tools that the Center launched on
      OpenSecrets.org in 2006: a database that tracks spending on federal
      lobbying, another that makes financial disclosure forms filed by members
      of Congress fully searchable and a third tool that tracks
      lawmakers’ privately sponsored trips around the world.
