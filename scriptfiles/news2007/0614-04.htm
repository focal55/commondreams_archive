<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 14 -David Krieger, the co-founder and president of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, has been chosen to join 49 other leaders from around the world in a new endeavor which aims to take innovative steps to reach a secure and sustainable future for the planet.

 

<P></P>The World Future Council includes: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mairead Corrigan-Maguire, Author France Moore-Lappé, Founder of the Body Shop Dame Anita Roddick and Musician & Human Rights Advocate, Youssou N’Dour, as well as scholars, diplomats, and nonprofit leaders.

 

<P></P>Dr. Krieger attended the inaugural congress of The World Future Council last month in Hamburg, Germany. The Council seized the opportunity to issue a worldwide “Call to Action.”  Top priorities were addressing the issues of global warming and nuclear weapons. The May 13th declaration  read in part:  

<P></P>“Nuclear weapons remain humanity’s most immediate catastrophic threat. These weapons would destroy cities, countries, civilization and possibly humanity itself. The danger posed by nuclear weapons in any hands must be confronted directly and urgently through a new initiative for the elimination of these instruments of annihilation.”

<P></P>Dr. Krieger and the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation are based in Santa Barbara, California.

 

 

<P></P>World Future Council: The council describes itself as “a new voice in the global political arena – one that draws on our shared human values to champion the rights of future generations, and works to ensure that humanity acts now for a sustainable future… Despite having the means to tackle many of the problems we currently face, the existing global system of governance has so far seemed incapable of addressing them, often failing to adopt available solutions. The World Future Council will identify and promote successful policies, using existing networks to connect with over 25,000 parliamentarians, and more than 8,000 civil society organizations worldwide.”

<P></P>David Krieger: Peace leader, international campaigner and poet, Dr. Krieger has initiated many innovative projects for building peace, strengthening international law and abolishing nuclear weapons. He has lectured throughout the US, Europe and Asia on issues of peace, security, international law, and the abolition of nuclear weapons. Dr. Krieger is Chair of the International Network of Engineers and Scientists for Global Responsibility, a member of the International Steering Committee of the Middle Powers Initiative, and a founder and member of the Global Council of Abolition 2000. He serves on the Advisory Council of Free the Children International, Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation and the Right Livelihood Foundation among many others. He is a recipient of Global Green's Millennium Award for International Environmental Leadership and the Peace Writing Award of the Peace and Justice Studies Association and OMNI Center for Peace, Justice and Ecology.
