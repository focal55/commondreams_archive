<p>WASHINGTON - AUGUST 6 - Five new lawmakers,
including the highest ranking military veteran in Congress, have joined 126
other lawmakers in supporting legislation to repeal the military's "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" ban on lesbian, gay and bisexual service personnel.
Representatives Michael A. Arcuri (D-NY), Brian Baird (D-WA), Adam Schiff
(D- CA), Joe Sestak (D-PA) and Brad Sherman (D-CA) all became co-sponsors
of The Military Readiness Enhancement Act (H.R. 1246) on Friday, bringing
the total number of supporters to 131. Sestak is Congress's highest-ranking
veteran, having served 31 years in the United States Navy and retiring as a
3-star Admiral.
<P></P>"Congress is steadily moving toward lifting the ban and welcoming
lesbian and gay Americans who want to serve our country," said Sharra E.
Greer, director of law and policy for Servicemembers Legal Defense Network
(SLDN). "Americans overwhelmingly support repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't
Tell,' and value the contributions that gay troops bring to our armed
forces. When it comes to capturing terrorists, deciphering intelligence and
protecting our nation, sexual orientation is irrelevant. It is talent and
skill that is paramount to our success at home and abroad."
    <P></P>Writing in Monday's Detroit News, columnist Deb Price noted that, "The
Pentagon is no longer frozen solid in angry opposition to lifting the ban
on gays serving openly in the military." Congresswoman Susan Davis (D-CA),
chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, told
Price that she intends to hold hearings on the issue. "Absolutely, I think
the series of hearings would build the case," for lifting the ban, Davis
said. "I've not been impressed that [lifting] it is something that would
hamper readiness, retention [or] recruitment."
    <P></P>During hearings last week, Admiral Michael Mullen, President Bush's
nominee for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Senator Susan
Collins (R-ME) that he would welcome a Congressional inquiry about "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell." "I'd love to have Congress make its own decisions"
regarding the law, he said during confirmation hearings. "I really think it
is for the American people to come forward, really through this body, to
both debate that policy and make changes, if that's appropriate."
    <P></P>The Military Readiness Enhancement Act, which would repeal "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell" and allow lesbian, gay and bisexual personnel to serve openly,
is sponsored by Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher (D-CA). For more information

    <P></P>Servicemembers Legal Defense Network is a national, non-profit legal
services, watchdog and policy organization dedicated to ending

"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and related forms of intolerance. For more
