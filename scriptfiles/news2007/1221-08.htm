<p>OTTAWA - December 21 - The Council of Canadians is deeply disappointed with the CRTC’s decision yesterday to allow the purchase of Alliance Atlantis by broadcaster CanWest Global, which grants U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs nearly two-thirds ownership of two of Canada’s largest media companies, and which could pave the way for more foreign ownership of Canadian media.
<p></p>
“We’re very disappointed with the Commission’s ruling,” says Garry Neil, a Council of Canadians board member and cultural policy expert. “This decision opens the door to significantly increased foreign ownership of Canadian broadcasting and cable companies that over the years have been able to grow because of supportive government policies and measures.”
<p></p>
As the Council stated in its November 16 presentation to the CRTC, foreign companies with significant control of Canadian broadcasters, cable companies or other firms involved in Canada’s broadcasting system would have access to the provisions of Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would allow them to sue governments and seek compensation for other cultural policies or actions that limit their investors rights under NAFTA.
<p></p>
“Foreign ownership restrictions are critical to maintaining appropriate regulations in our broadcasting system,” said the Council in its submission. “In turn, such regulations are essential to ensuring that the private sector players have appropriate responsibility for achieving the objectives of the Broadcasting Act, including editorial diversity and bringing Canadian stories and artists to our television screens. All of this is essential for our democracy, our culture and maintaining our sovereignty.”
<p></p>

<i>Founded in 1985, the Council of Canadians is Canada’s largest citizens’ organization, with members and chapters across the country. We work to protect the public interest by promoting progressive policies on fair trade, clean water, energy security, public health care, and other issues of social and economic concern.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
