<p>WASHINGTON - JULY 13 - On July 15, small and independent publishers will be hit with a major postage rate increase that threatens to push many of them out of print. Yet just days before the new rates are supposed to take effect, most publishers still don't know how much they're supposed to pay — leaving them unable to prepare for the severe financial burden the hike is likely to inflict. <br><br>"The situation is unfair," said Teresa Stack, publisher of The Nation. "These rate changes are likely to cost The Nation an additional $500,000 annually. But we can't be sure, because the software has not been available to precisely determine the increase — or plan ways to offset these new costs. We need Congress to intercede and give us the time we need to assess our options." <br><br>An ideologically diverse coalition of publishers sent an urgent letter yesterday asking Congress to call on the U.S. Postal Service to postpone the increase and give publishers at least 60 days after the software is released to make the appropriate adjustments. Publications that signed the letter include The American Prospect, The American Spectator, Columbia Journalism Review, In These Times, Mother Jones, National Review, The Nation, The New Republic and Washington Monthly, among others. <br><br>The crippling periodical rate increase — proposed by the nation's largest publisher, Time Warner Inc. — would burden smaller publishers with higher postage rates and unfairly lock in the best rates for the largest media companies. Cost estimates suggest that the increase could force many publications to the brink of bankruptcy and prevent new titles from getting off the ground. <br><br>"These new rates benefit the publishers of Entertainment Weekly and Vanity Fair at the considerable expense of smaller journals such as National Review and The Nation," said Jack Fowler, publisher of the National Review. "Many publishers face increases of 20 percent and up — a hike that is sure to put some out of business." <br><br>The periodical rate increase was pushed back two months from its initial May implementation to give publishers time to determine the least costly mailing practices under the new system using rate calculation tools. The industry standard calculation software — produced by a private firm using USPS technical specifications — was badly delayed. This forced publishers to rely on incomplete cost estimates. The final version of the software became available only days ago and not all publishers have it yet. <br><br>"The lopsided rate increase is badly misguided — and the calculator problem just adds insult to injury," said Ben Scott, policy director of Free Press. "Small and independent publishers have not been given ample time and tools to prepare for the consequences of the most significant change in periodical rates in generations. The need to protect the independent press is urgent." <br><br>For more information about the campaign against the postal rate increase, visit <a href="http://action.freepress.net/campaign/postal" target="_new">StopPostalRateHikes.com</a>. <br>
