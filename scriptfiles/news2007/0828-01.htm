<p>WASHINGTON - August 28 -The American Civil Liberties Union today condemned the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the effect of its vague and 
inconsistent treatment of "indecency." Because of the uncertainty, some 
broadcasters are wary of airing a documentary on World War II since the fourteen 
hour movie contains a total of four expletives. The film, "The War" by filmmaker 
Ken Burns, is scheduled to air on the Public Broadcasting Channel on September 
23. The FCC has the ability to enforce indecency laws by fining broadcasters for 
instances of "indecency" between 6 a.m. and 10pm. </p>
<p>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</p>

<p>"To impede the First Amendment rights of those who fought and died for those 
very rights is reprehensible. Our public broadcasters should not be afraid to 
air fourteen hours of an educational and fact-based documentary because of a 
handful of profanities. Images of the brutality of war are far more disturbing 
than any four letter word. </p>
<p>"This clearly settles any question about the chilling effect of the FCC’s 
vague and contradictory indecency regime. Broadcasters should not have to guess 
whether or not a work is "indecent," and face substantial fines if they guess 
wrong. When it comes to what we allow our children to see on television, parents 
must be the first line of defense – not the government." <br>
