<p>MINNEAPOLIS - February 27 - A chemical known to be toxic to the nervous and reproductive system, and
a developmental toxin, leaches from popular clear, plastic baby bottles, according to Toxic Baby
Bottles: Scientific Study Finds Leaching Chemicals in Clear Plastic Baby Bottles, a new report
released today. The chemical, called bisphenol A, is a disruptor of hormone function and has
been found by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the urine of 95 percent of Americans
tested.
<p>The report is based on independent laboratory testing of the most popular baby bottles on the
market commissioned by the Environment California Research and Policy Center. It can be
found at: www.EnvironmentCalifornia.org.
<p>“We all want to raise our children in ways that are safe, healthy and that maximize their potential,”
said David Wallinga, MD, Director of the Food and Health Program at the Institute for
Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP). “Sadly, that’s made harder by the fact that manufacturers
aren’t required to give parents even the most basic safety information on toxic chemicals in baby
bottles and other household products.” IATP works in coalition with the Environment California
Research and Policy Center for safer plastic and other consumer products.
<p>Five of the most popular brands of baby bottles on the market were tested to determine whether
bisphenol A leached from the bottles into liquids contained inside them. All five leached bisphenol
A at levels that have been found to cause harm in numerous laboratory animal studies.

Bisphenol A is most commonly used to make clear polycarbonate plastic for consumer products,
such as baby bottles. Through use, this plastic breaks down and leaches bisphenol A into liquids
and food to which it comes into contact.
<p>Scientists have linked very low doses of bisphenol A exposure to cancers, impaired immune function, early onset of
puberty, obesity, diabetes, and hyperactivity, among other problems. Alarmingly, the median level of bisphenol A
found by the CDC in humans is higher than the level found in animals to cause adverse health effects.
<p>“Parents can’t make informed health choices about baby products when they’re left in the dark by manufacturers.”
said Wallinga, a physician. “We need a drastic overhaul in how we regulate consumer products to require manufacturers
to demonstrate their products are safe, made safely, and made from safe ingredients, before they’re allowed on
the market.”
<p>Absent action by state or federal authorities to protect consumers from bisphenol A, or to ensure that consumers are
notified of bisphenol A in baby and other products, IATP recommends that parents and other childcare providers:
<p>· Choose glass or safer-plastic baby bottles; see IATP’s Smart Plastics Guide for more information (www.iatp.org)
<p>· Never heat food or beverages in plastic containers or bottles, which can speed up the process of toxic chemicals
leaching out of the plastic;
<p>· In washing plastic products, avoid harsh dishwashing soap and hot water, both of which speed up leaching.<!-- #EndEditable -->
