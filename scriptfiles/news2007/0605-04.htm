<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 5 - Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
which is often accused of growing at the expense of smaller retailers,
continues to benefit enormously from state and local government economic
development subsidies, including 39 deals worth more than $200 million in
just the past three years. This according to Good Jobs First, a non-profit
research group which today issued an update of its landmark 2004 report
Shopping for Subsidies, which found more than $1 billion in subsidies for
Wal-Mart facilities.
    <P></P>Details of the 39 new deals, combined with more than 240 deals from the
2004 report, are available on a new searchable website called Wal-Mart
Subsidy Watch (http://www.walmartsubsidywatch.org). The original 2004
Shopping for Subsidies report and other Good Jobs First material can be
found at http://www.goodjobsfirst.org.
    <P></P>"What we said in 2004 still holds true today: Wal-Mart presents itself
as an entrepreneurial success story, yet it routinely gets big tax breaks,
free land, cash grants and other forms of taxpayer assistance," said Philip
Mattera, research director of Good Jobs First.
    <P></P>"That a company with a predatory business model and a poverty-wage
labor policy can even qualify for job subsidies suggests many public
officials still don't get it," said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good
Jobs First. "When they sit down at the table with Wal-Mart, the prize at
stake is not a new Wal- Mart; the prize is access to more market share."
    <P></P>The new subsidy deals benefit 30 stores and 9 distribution centers in
15 states. The stores accounted for $190 million of the $220 million total,
an average of $6 million per store. The distribution centers accounted for
$30 million, an average of $3 million per facility. The distribution center
amount is understated, because several warehouses will enjoy enterprise
zone benefits, the value of which cannot be estimated before the centers
open and begin hiring.
   <P></P>The state with the most new deals was Illinois with 9. It was followed
by Florida and Missouri with 4 each; Arizona, California and Kansas with 3
each; and Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana and Ohio with 2 each. Alabama,
Maryland, Minnesota, Texas and Wyoming each had one recent deal. Illinois
also accounts for the most deals in the entire Wal-Mart Subsidy Watch
database with 38.
