<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - MAY 31 -Larry Cox, Amnesty International USA’s Executive Director, made the following statement in response to reports of the death of a detainee by apparent suicide in Guantanamo Bay: 

<P></P>“This tragedy is another illustration of the desperation many detainees face at Guantanamo Bay and one more reason that the Guantanamo Bay prison camp must be shut down.  Many suspects have been in custody without charge or trial, most for over 5 years. Amnesty International urges an immediate independent investigation into the man’s death and calls on  Bush administration officials to improve conditions for those who remain.  Many detainees are held in very harsh, permanent conditions of extreme isolation and sensory deprivation - particularly those in Camps 5 and 6.   

<P></P>“As Amnesty International sends it condolences to the deceased’s family, we must remember that every man in the facility is a father, brother or son.  Regardless of one’s innocence or guilt, everyone must be afforded due process and the rule of law – the cornerstone of justice.” 

<P></P>Amnesty International also reiterates its call for independent human rights monitors to be given full, unlimited access to the detainees at the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay.  The organization urges that all detainees be allowed regular contact with their families and that independent health care professionals are permitted to examine detainees in private.<!-- #EndEditable -->
