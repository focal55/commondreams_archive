<br>
<b>Tuesday, October 9th at 9:35pm e/p<br>
<u><i>WE FEED THE WORLD</i> (U.S. Television Premiere)</u></b> - Directed
by Erwin Wagenhofer.  Filmed in six countries, this award-winning Austrian
documentary offers a sweeping view of food production in the age of
globalization, consolidation and mechanization.  <br>
<br>
<b>Tuesday, October 23  at 9:35pm e/p<br>

<u><i>ENERGY WAR</i> (U.S. Television Premiere)</u></b> - Directed by
Shuchen Tan, IJsbrand van Veelen, Rudi Boon.  With the global demand for
energy continually increasing, so does the power held by the relative
handful of nations -- including Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Nigeria, Sudan
and Saudi Arabia - that are rich in oil and natural gas.  This Dutch
documentary explores the geopolitical consequences of the world's
dependency on fossil fuels. <br>
<br>
<b>Tuesday, November 6  at 9:35pm e/p<br>
<u><i>RADIANT CITY</i> (U.S. Television Premiere)</u></b> - Directed by
Gary Burns and Jim Brown.   This Canadian film packs a few surprises as it
explores the modern face of suburbia, where life unfolds in discrete
residential, commercial and civic "pods."  Several urban design
professionals and academics, including the hilariously acerbic author
James Howard Kunstler, address the principles behind North American
subdivisions and their impact on individuals. <br>
<br>
<b>Tuesday, November 20 at 9:35pm e/p<br>

<u><i>BEFORE THE FLOOD</i> (U.S. Television Premiere)</u></b> - Directed
by David Lindsay.   <i>Before the Flood</i> visits the small island nation
of Tuvalu which lies just three meters above sea level, a fact that makes
it extremely vulnerable to global climate change.  Rising tides have all
but swallowed the country's beaches and the odds are that Tuvalu itself
will soon sink into the South Pacific.   <br>
<br>
<b>Tuesday, December 11th at 9:35pm e/p<br>
<u><i>STRANGE CULTURE</i> (U.S. Television Premiere)</u> </b>- directed by
Lynn Hershman Leeson.  Artist and college professor Steve Kurtz was
preparing for an exhibition that let audiences test if food had been
genetically modified when his wife died of heart failure in her sleep. 
When the medics arrived they became suspicious of his art supplies and
called in the FBI who treated Kurtz as a suspected terrorist.  <br>

				 <br>
<b>Tuesday, December 18th at 9:35pm e/p	<br>
<u><i>SOMBA KE: THE MONEY PLACE</i> (U.S. Television Premiere)</u> </b>-
directed by David Henningson.  In the 1940s the Canadian Government
operated a mine on the Arctic Circle in order to secretly supply uranium
for the United States' Manhattan Project. Today, this same mine, known to
the local Sahtu Dene First Nations as Somba Ke - "the money place" is at

the epicenter of the massive uranium exploration boom. <br>
<br>
<i><b>THE GREEN</b></i>  presents original series and documentary
premieres about the earth's ecology and concepts of "green" living that
balance human needs with responsible care for the planet.  The destination
airs every Tuesday on Sundance Channel and is designed to be both edifying
and entertaining, with an emphasis on information, practical advice and
community building.  Presented by Robert Redford, the destination is
hosted by award-winning journalist Simran Sethi and community advocate and
MacArthur Fellow Majora Carter, two dynamic leaders who have distinguished
themselves with revolutionary ideas in such areas as civic planning and
global business practices.    <br>
<br>
