<p>WASHINGTON - JUNE 7 -  In a new analysis released today, the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation reports that the U.S. government has spent or allocated over $40 billion to address the threat of biological weapons since September 2001. For FY2008, the Bush administration is proposing an additional $6.77 billion in bioweapons-related spending, approximately $550 million (or 9%) more than the amount Congress appropriated in FY2007. If the FY2008 request is fully funded, total bioweapons-related funding since FY2001 will exceed $48 billion.

 

<P></P>Funding continues to focus primarily on research, development, acquisition, and stockpiling of medical countermeasures and protective equipment, with over $31 billion devoted to these functions through FY2008. Medical surveillance and environmental detection of biological weapons agents totals over $3 billion, and improving state, local, and hospital preparedness totals over $9 billion through FY2008. Less than 2% (or $875 million) of all federal bioweapons-related funding through FY2008 is devoted to efforts to prevent the development, acquisition, and use of biological weapons by states and non-state terrorist actors.  

 

<P></P>DR. ALAN PEARSON, Director of the Biological and Chemical Weapons Program at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, explained that “Prevention is inherently less expensive than preparedness and response, but the Administration’s particularly low level of funding for prevention reflects the low priority it accords bioweapons prevention efforts in general.”  

 

<P></P>DR. PEARSON concluded: “The proposed increase in funding for the Defense Department’s Biological Threat Reduction Program is a step forward. Now the State Department and other federal agencies need to step up their prevention efforts. A strong commitment to cooperative international action against the development and use of biological weapons is essential for improving this nation’s security.”
