<p>  WASHINGTON - September 26 - Fox News Channel's recent statement in 
response to the racially charged remarks made by Bill O'Reilly is emblematic of 
a larger problem -- the cable news channel's long record of racially divisive 
reporting and commentary, which belie its claims to be a respectable news 
organization.</p>

<p>In response to coverage of O'Reilly's shocking comments 
about his dining experience in Harlem, Bill 
Shine, senior vice president of programming at Fox News, released the following 
equally shocking statement, "<b>This is nothing 
more than left wing outlets stirring up false racism accusations for ratings. 
It's sad</b>." </p>

<p>Fox News' statement ignores the larger problem that 
comments like O'Reilly's present for the network's integrity, instead launching 
into an attack on rival news organizations.</p>

<p>"<b>Fox News' response 
to the uproar over O'Reilly's statements sounds like spin you'd hear from a 
political campaign in damage control mode, not what you'd expect from a 
legitimate news organization</b>," said Eric Burns, Chief Communications 
Strategist at <i>Media Matters for 
America</i>. "<b>Their response resorts 
to a partisan attack, belying their claim to be a principled news 
source."</b>  </p>

<p><i><i>In fact, Fox's response clearly 
demonstrates that the problem is deeper than just O'Reilly. As</i> 
Media Matters <i>has repeatedly documented, these comments are part 
of a long history of</i></i> racially divisive reporting and 
commentary<i><i>. 
The dismissive response of Fox News executives to those who raise important 
questions about Fox's racially charged commentary and how it affects the 
integrity of their news coverage says more about the values of Fox News than 
anything else.</i></i></p>
