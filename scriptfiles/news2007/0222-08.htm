<p>GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan - February 22 - Standing with Mayor Heartwell
of Grand Rapids in a Green Building, Environment
Michigan Research &amp; Policy Center
released an in-depth study showing how clean energy can help revitalize
Michigan&rsquo;s economy.&nbsp; According to an innovative peer-reviewed model
in Energizing Michigan&rsquo;s Economy:&nbsp; Creating Jobs, Reducing Pollution
with Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Electric Power, strong commitments to
renewable
energy and energy efficiency would generate at least the following
benefits (through
2020):
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Now is the time for Michigan
to take bold steps towards becoming the epicenter of clean energy development,&rdquo;
said Mike Shriberg, Director of
Environment Michigan and co-author of the report.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doing so will reinvigorate our economy,
create the jobs of today and tomorrow, save consumers money, and protect our
environment.&rdquo;<br />
<br />Two core policies are needed to achieve these benefits: 1) A
Renewable Energy Standard that requires 20% of the state&rsquo;s electricity to come from
renewable sources by 2020; 2) An Energy Efficiency Fund of $225 million per
year.&nbsp; Implementing these policies would eliminate
the need for new power plant construction, thus saving ratepayers billions in
rate increases and reducing the $20 billion per year that Michiganders spend on
energy imports.<br /><br />&ldquo;Michiganders are sending the equivalent of $1,700 per
person to other states to meet our energy needs,&rdquo; said Kim Pargoff, Clean
Energy Advocate with Environment Michigan.&nbsp;

&ldquo;With energy efficiency and renewables, we keep our hard-earned money
working for Michigan
while reducing pollution.&rdquo;<br /><br />With Michigan&rsquo;s
economy in crisis and our energy path at a crossroads, the Governor and
Legislature are debating an overhaul of energy policy that will have major implications
for ratepayers and public health. &nbsp;The
report directly compares the Granholm-ordered 21st Century Energy
Plan with a strong commitment to clean energy.&nbsp;
The results show that the 21st Century Energy Plan would
bring in only 1/3 as many jobs and approximately half the consumer savings of
strong policies because of its tepid recommendations on clean energy.<br /><br />&ldquo;<a name="OLE_LINK2" /><a name="OLE_LINK1">A bold, clean electricity plan will energize </a>Michigan&rsquo;s economy&rdquo;,
stated David Pettit, Consumer Associate
for Public Interest Research Group in Michigan.
&nbsp;&ldquo;The first step in that plan is to
invest in the cheapest and cleanest resource available &ndash; energy efficiency.&rdquo;<br /><br />As the report highlights, Michigan
is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in clean energy research and
development, and high-tech manufacturing because of its unparalleled industrial
base. <br /><br />
&ldquo;Michigan
has a once-in-a-generation chance to change course &ndash; from old and dirty fossil
fuel-based energy to a more efficient economy powered by renewable energy,&rdquo;

concluded Shriberg.&nbsp; &ldquo;The key is strong, visionary
commitments from our leaders.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.environmentmichigan.org/reports/energy/energy-program-reports/energizing-michigans-economy" target="_blank">Click here for a complete copy of the report.</a>&nbsp;</p>
