<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 - Last night, the Federal Communications Commission adopted measures that: (1) could allow for more low power FM radio stations to enter the market and (2) save LPFM stations that are threatened from being knocked off the air by a full power station.
<P></P>
Parul P. Desai, Associate Director of the Media Access Project, issued the following statement in response to the Commission's action:
<P></P>
"LPFM advocates have waited a long time for the Commission to act on expanding and preserving the LPFM service. The Commission's action goes a long way in doing just that. Chairman Martin rarely agrees with us, but he was willing to listen, and to work with us to get a fine result. He should be congratulated for recognizing the critical service that LPFM stations provide to the needs of local communities and taking the necessary steps that will help bring more LPFM radio stations to communities throughout the country."
<P></P>
