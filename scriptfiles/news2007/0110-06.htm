<p>SEATTLE, Washington - January 10 - Bert Sacks was fined $10,000 for traveling to Iraq to bring medicines
to needy children.  Through his fine he is challenging US policies on 
Iraq with a question to the Supreme Court: Was it legal for the US to
have knowingly caused the deaths of Iraqis, especially the hundreds of
thousands of Iraqi children who died from unsafe water during
sanctions? 

<p>On Tuesday, January 16th, in a press conference from 1 to 2 pm at the
National Press Club in Washington, DC, he will discuss his petition to
the court, filed January 8th.

<p>His petition to the Supreme Court details the results of bombing 
Iraq's electrical plants in 1991, followed by 12 years of economic
sanctions.  The petition itself is posted at BertOnIraq.blogspot.com.
It is hard to imagine a topic more relevant to considerations of 
future US actions than the impact of so many deaths caused by previous
US actions.

<p>Sacks will be introduced by Denis Halliday, a 34-year veteran of the
UN who resigned his positions as UN Assistant Secretary General and 
Chief UN Relief Coordinator to protest the sanctions in 1998, after
heading the Iraq oil-for-food program for 13 months.

<p>The press conference will take place on the 16th anniversary of the
start of the 1991 Gulf War.  This date marks 16 years of war, 
occurring in three different forms, which the Iraqi people have
suffered through.  There have certainly been well over a million Iraqi
deaths.

<p>It will also take place one day after Martin Luther King Day.  In his 
famous Riverside Church address speaking about Vietnam Dr. King said,
"Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the
Vietnamese …. It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so
carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize 
that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and
political defeat."

<p>Might not the same be said today about our calculations regarding
Iraq?  The news conference will provide evidence that the preceding 
years of sanctions are not ancient history for Iraqis.  To choose wise
actions today, it is necessary to understand those years.

<p>As British foreign journalist Robert Fisk put it, "The sanctions that
smothered Iraq for almost thirteen years have largely dropped from the
story of our Middle East adventures.  Our invasion of Iraq in March
2003 closed the page - or so we hoped - on our treatment of the Iraqi
people before that date, removed the stigma attached to the 
imprisonment of an entire nation and their steady debilitation and
death under the UN sanctions regime.  When the Anglo-American
occupiers settled into their palaces in Baghdad, they would blame the
collapse of electrical power, water-pumping stations, factories and 
commercial life on Saddam Hussein …  [Sanctions] were "ghosted" out of
the story."
