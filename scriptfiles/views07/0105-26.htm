   <i>The following is an adaptation of remarks made by Bill Moyers to a
December 12 gathering in New York sponsored by </i>The Nation<i>, Demos, the
Brennan Center for Justice and the New Democracy Project.&nbsp;--The Editors </i>
<p>

You could not have chosen a better time to gather. Voters have provided
a respite from a right-wing radicalism predicated on the philosophy that
extremism in the pursuit of virtue is no vice. It seems only yesterday
that the Trojan horse of conservatism was hauled into Washington to
disgorge Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay, Ralph Reed, Grover Norquist and their
hearty band of ravenous predators masquerading as a political party of
small government, fiscal restraint and moral piety and promising "to
restore accountability to Congress...[and] make us all proud again of
the way free people govern themselves." 
</p>
<p>

Well, the long night of the junta is over, and Democrats are ebullient
as they prepare to take charge of the multitrillion-dollar
influence racket that we used to call the US Congress. Let them rejoice
while they can, as long as they remember that while they ran some good
campaigns, they have arrived at this moment mainly because George W.
Bush lost a war most people have come to believe should never have been
fought in the first place. Let them remember, too, in this interim of
sweet anticipation, that although they are reveling in the ruins of
a Republican reign brought down by stupendous scandals, their own closet
is stocked with skeletons from an era when they were routed from office
following Abscam bribes and savings and loan swindles that plucked the
pockets and purses of hard-working, tax-paying Americans.

</p>
<p>

As they rejoice, Democrats would be wise to be mindful of Shakespeare's
counsel, "'Tis more by fortune...than by merit." For they were delivered
from the wilderness not by their own goodness and purity but by the
grace of K Street corruption, DeLay Inc.'s duplicity, the pitiless
exploitation of Terri Schiavo, the disgrace of Mark Foley and a shameful
partisan cover-up, the shamelessness of Jack Abramoff and a
partisan conspiracy, and neocon arrogance and amorality (yes, amoral:
Apparently there is no end to the number of bodies Bill Kristol and
Richard Perle are prepared to watch pile up on behalf of illusions that
can't stand the test of reality even one Beltway block from the think
tanks where they are hatched). The Democrats couldn't have been more
favored by the gods if they had actually believed in one!
</p>
<p>

But whatever one might say about the election, the real story is one
that our political and media elites are loath to acknowledge or address.
I am not speaking of the lengthy list of priorities that
progressives and liberals of every stripe are eager to put on the table
now that Democrats hold the cards in Congress. Just the other day a
message popped up on my computer from a progressive advocate whose work
I greatly admire. Committed to movement-building from the ground
up, he has results to show for his labors. His request was
simple: "With changes in Congress and at our state capitol, we want your
input on what top issues our lawmakers should tackle. Click here to
submit your top priority."
</p>
<p>

I clicked. Sure enough, up came a list of thirty-four issues--an
impressive list that began with "African-American" and ran
alphabetically through "energy" and "higher education" to "guns,"
"transportation," "women's issues" and "workers' rights." It wasn't a
list to be dismissed, by any means, for it came from an unrequited
thirst for action after a long season of malignant opposition to every
item on the agenda. I understand the mindset. Here's a fellow who values
allies and appreciates what it takes to build coalitions; who knows that
although our interests as citizens vary, each one is an artery to the
heart that pumps life through the body politic, and each is important to
the health of democracy. This is an activist who knows political success
is the sum of many parts.
</p>
<p>

But America needs something more right now than a "must-do" list from
liberals and progressives. America needs a different story. The very
morning I read the message from the progressive activist, the <i>New York
Times</i> reported on Carol Ann Reyes. Carol Ann Reyes is 63. She lives in
Los Angeles, suffers from dementia and is homeless. Somehow she made her
way to a hospital with serious, untreated needs. No details
were provided as to what happened to her there, except that the
hospital--which is part of Kaiser Permanente, the largest HMO
in the country--called a cab and sent her back to skid row. True, they
phoned ahead to workers at a rescue shelter to let them know she was
coming. But some hours later a surveillance camera picked her up
"wandering around the streets in a hospital gown and slippers." Dumped
in America.

</p>




   <p>
Here is the real political story, the one most politicians won't even
acknowledge: the reality of the anonymous, disquieting daily struggle of
ordinary people, including the most marginalized and vulnerable
Americans but also young workers and elders and parents, families and
communities, searching for dignity and fairness against long odds in a
cruel market world.

</p>
<p>

Everywhere you turn you'll find people who believe they have been
written out of the story. Everywhere you turn there's a sense of
insecurity grounded in a gnawing fear that freedom in America has come
to mean the freedom of the rich to get richer even as millions of
Americans are dumped from the Dream. So let me say what I think up
front: The leaders and thinkers and activists who honestly tell that
story and speak passionately of the moral and religious values it puts
in play will be the first political generation since the New Deal to win
power back for the people.
</p>
<p>

There's no mistaking that America is ready for change. One of our
leading analysts of public opinion, Daniel Yankelovich, reports that a
majority want social cohesion and common ground based on pragmatism and
compromise, patriotism and diversity. But because of the great
disparities in wealth, the "shining city on the hill" has become a gated
community whose privileged occupants, surrounded by a moat of money and
protected by a political system seduced with cash into subservience, are
removed from the common life of the country. The wreckage of this
abdication by elites is all around us.
</p>

<p>

Corporations are shredding the social compact, pensions are
disappearing, median incomes are flattening and healthcare costs are
soaring. In many ways, the average household is generally worse off
today than it was thirty years ago, and the public sector that was a
support system and safety net for millions of Americans across
three generations is in tatters. For a time, stagnating wages were
somewhat offset by more work and more personal debt. Both political
parties craftily refashioned those major renovations of the average
household as the new standard, shielding employers from responsibility
for anything Wall Street didn't care about. Now, however, the more acute
major risks workers have been forced to bear as employers reduce their
health and retirement costs--on orders from Wall Street--have made it
clear that our fortunes are being reversed. Polls show that a majority
of US workers now believe their children will be worse off than they
are. In one recent survey, only 14 percent of workers said that they
have obtained the American Dream.
</p>
<p>

It is hard to believe that less than four decades ago a key architect of
the antipoverty program, Robert Lampman, could argue that the
"recent history of Western nations reveals an increasingly widespread
adoption of the idea that substantial equality of social and economic
conditions among individuals is a good thing." Economists call that
postwar era "the Great Compression." Poverty and inequality had declined
dramatically for the first time in our history. Here, as Paul Krugman
recently recounted, is how <i>Time</i>'s report on the national
outlook in 1953 summed it up: "Even in the smallest towns and most
isolated areas, the U.S. is wearing a very prosperous, middle-class suit
of clothes, and an attitude of relaxation and confidence. People are not
growing wealthy, but more of them than ever before are getting along."
African-Americans were still written out of the story, but that was
changing, too, as heroic resistance emerged across
the South to awaken our national conscience. Within a decade,
thanks to the civil rights movement and President Johnson, the racial
cast of federal policy--including some New Deal
programs--was aggressively repudiated, and shared prosperity began to
breach the color line.
</p>
<p>

To this day I remember John F. Kennedy's landmark speech at the Yale
commencement in 1962. Echoing Daniel Bell's cold war classic <i>The End of
Ideology</i>, JFK proclaimed the triumph of "practical management of a
modern economy" over the "grand warfare of rival ideologies." The
problem with this--and still a major problem today--is that the
purported ideological cease-fire ended only a few years later. But the
Democrats never re-armed, and they kept pinning all their hopes on
economic growth, which by its very nature is valueless and cannot alone
provide answers to social and moral questions that arise in the face of
resurgent crisis. While "practical management of a modern economy" had a
kind of surrogate legitimacy as long as it worked, when it no longer
worked, the nation faced a paralyzing moral void in deciding how the
burdens should be borne. Well-organized conservative forces, firing on
all ideological pistons, rushed to fill this void with a story corporate
America wanted us to hear. Inspired by bumper-sticker abstractions of
Milton Friedman's ideas, propelled by cascades of cash from
corporate chieftans like Coors and Koch and "Neutron" Jack Welch,
fortified by the pious prescriptions of fundamentalist political
preachers like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, the conservative
armies marched on Washington. And they succeeded brilliantly. 
</p>
<p>

When Ronald Reagan addressed the Republican National Convention in 1980,
he a told a simple story, one that had great impact. "The major issue of
this campaign is the direct political, personal and moral responsibility
of Democratic Party leadership--in the White House and in Congress--for
this unprecedented calamity which has befallen us." He declared, "I will
not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself." It was a
speech of bold contrasts, of good private interest versus bad
government, of course. More important, it personified these
two forces in a larger narrative of freedom, reaching back across the
Great Depression, the Civil War and the American Revolution, all
the way back to the Mayflower Compact. It so dazzled and demoralized
Democrats they could not muster a response to the moral abandonment
and social costs that came with the Reagan revolution. 
</p>
<p>

We too have a story of freedom to tell, and it too reaches back across
the Great Depression, the Civil War and the American Revolution,
all the way back to the Mayflower Compact. It's a story with clear and
certain foundations, like Reagan's, but also a tumultuous and sometimes
violent history of betrayal that he and other conservatives consistently
and conveniently ignore. 
</p>
<p>

Reagan's story of freedom superficially alludes to the Founding
Fathers, but its substance comes from the Gilded Age, devised
by apologists for the robber barons. It is posed abstractly as the
freedom of the individual from government control--a Jeffersonian ideal
at the root of our Bill of Rights, to be sure. But what it meant in
politics a century later, and still means today, is the freedom to
accumulate wealth without social or democratic responsibilities and the
license to buy the political system right out from under everyone else,
so that democracy no longer has the ability to hold capitalism
accountable for the good of the whole. 
</p>




   <p>

And that is not how freedom was understood when our country was founded.
At the heart of our experience as a nation is the proposition that each
one of us has a right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
As flawed in its reach as it was brilliant in its inspiration for times
to come, that proposition carries an inherent imperative: "inasmuch as
the members of a liberal society have a right to basic requirements of
human development such as education and a minimum standard of security,
they have obligations to each other, mutually and through their
government, to ensure that conditions exist enabling every person to
have the opportunity for success in life." 

</p>
<p>

The quote comes directly from Paul Starr, one of our most formidable
public thinkers, whose forthcoming book, <i>Freedom's Power: The True Force
of Liberalism</i>, is a profound and stirring call for liberals to reclaim
the idea of America's greatness as their own. Starr's book is one of
three new books that in a just world would be on every desk in the House
and Senate when Congress convenes again.
</p>
<p>

John Schwarz, in <i>Freedom Reclaimed: Rediscovering the American Vision</i>,
rescues the idea of freedom from market cultists whose "particular idea
of freedom...has taken us down a terribly mistaken road" toward a
political order where "government ends up servicing the powerful and
taking from everyone else." The free-market view "cannot provide us with
a philosophy we find compelling or meaningful," Schwarz writes. Nor does
it assure the availability of economic opportunity "that is truly
adequate to each individual and the status of full legal as well as
political equality." Yet since the late nineteenth century it has been
used to shield private power from democratic accountability, in no small
part because conservative rhetoric has succeeded in denigrating
government even as conservative politicians plunder it. 
</p>
<p>

But government, Schwarz reminds us, "is not simply the way we express
ourselves collectively but also often the only way we preserve our
freedom from private power and its incursions." That is one reason the
notion that every person has a right to meaningful opportunity "has
assumed the position of a moral bottom line in the nation's popular
culture ever since the beginning." Freedom, he says, is "considerably
more than a private value." It is essentially a social idea, which
explains why the worship of the free market "fails as a compelling idea
in terms of the moral reasoning of freedom itself." Let's get back to
basics, is Schwarz's message. Let's recapture our story. 

</p>
<p>

Norton Garfinkle picks up on both Schwarz and Starr in <i>The American
Dream vs. the Gospel of Wealth</i>, as he describes how America became the
first nation on earth to offer an economic vision of opportunity for
even the humblest beginner to advance, and then moved, in fits and
starts--but always irrepressibly--to the invocation of positive
government as the means to further that vision through politics. No one
understood this more clearly, Garfinkle writes, than Abraham Lincoln,
who called on the federal government to save the Union. He turned to
large government expenditures for internal improvements--canals, bridges
and railroads. He supported a strong national bank to stabilize the
currency. He provided the first major federal funding for education,
with the creation of land grant colleges. And he kept close to his heart
an abiding concern for the fate of ordinary people, especially the
ordinary worker but also the widow and orphan. Our greatest President
kept his eye on the sparrow. He believed government should be not just
"of the people" and "by the people" but "for the people."
Including, we can imagine, Carol Ann Reyes. 
</p>
<p>

The great leaders of our tradition--Jefferson, Lincoln and the two
Roosevelts--understood the power of our story. In my time it was FDR,
who exposed the false freedom of the aristocratic narrative. He made the
simple but obvious point that where once political royalists stalked the
land, now economic royalists owned everything standing. Mindful of
Plutarch's warning that "an imbalance between rich and poor is the
oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics," Roosevelt famously told
America, in 1936, that "the average man once more confronts the problem
that faced the Minute Man." He gathered together the remnants of the
great reform movements of the Progressive Age--including those of his
late-blooming cousin, Teddy--into a singular political cause that would
be ratified again and again by people who categorically rejected the
laissez-faire anarchy that had produced destructive, unfettered and
ungovernable power. Now came collective bargaining and workplace rules,
cash assistance for poor children, Social Security, the GI Bill,
home mortgage subsidies, progressive taxation--democratic instruments
that checked economic tyranny and helped secure America's great middle
class. And these were only the beginning. The Marshall Plan, the civil
rights revolution, reaching the moon, a huge leap in life
expectancy--every one of these great outward achievements of the last
century grew from shared goals and collaboration in the public interest.

</p>
<p>

So it is that contrary to what we have heard rhetorically for a
generation now, the individualist, greed-driven, free-market
ideology is at odds with our history and with what most
Americans really care about. More and more people agree that
growing inequality is bad for the country, that corporations have
too much power, that money in politics is corrupting democracy and that
working families and poor communities need and deserve help when the
market system fails to generate shared prosperity. Indeed, the American
public is committed to a set of values that almost perfectly contradicts
the conservative agenda that has dominated politics for a generation
now.
</p>



   <p>
The question, then, is not about changing people; it's about reaching
people. I'm not speaking simply of better information, a sharper and
clearer factual presentation to disperse the thick fogs generated by
today's spin machines. Of course, we always need stronger empirical
arguments to back up our case. It would certainly help if at least as
many people who believe, say, in a "literal devil" or that God
sent George W. Bush to the White House also knew that the top 1 percent
of households now have more wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined.
Yes, people need more information than they get from the media
conglomerates with their obsession for nonsense, violence and pap. And
we need, as we keep hearing, "new ideas." But we are at an extraordinary
moment. The conservative movement stands intellectually and morally
bankrupt while Democrats talk about a "new direction" without convincing
us they know the difference between a weather vane and a compass. The
right story will set our course for a generation to come.

</p>
<p>

Some stories doom us. In <i>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or
Succeed</i>, Jared Diamond tells of the Viking colony that disappeared in
the fifteenth century. The settlers had scratched a living on the sparse
coast of Greenland for years, until they encountered a series of harsh
winters. Their livestock, the staple of their diet, began to die off.
Although the nearby waters teemed with haddock and cod, the colony's
mythology prohibited the eating of fish. When their supply of hay ran
out during a last terrible winter, the colony was finished. They had
been doomed by their story. 
</p>
<p>

Here in the first decade of the twenty-first century the story that
becomes America's dominant narrative will shape our collective
imagination and hence our politics. In the searching of our souls
demanded by this challenge, those of us in this room and kindred spirits
across the nation must confront the most fundamental progressive failure
of the current era: the failure to embrace a moral vision of America
based on the transcendent faith that human beings are more than the sum
of their material appetites, our country is more than an
economic machine, and freedom is not license but responsibility--the
gift we have received and the legacy we must bequeath. 
</p>
<p>

In our brief sojourn here we are on a great journey. For those who came
before us and for those who follow, our moral, political and
religious duty is to make sure that this nation, which was conceived in
liberty and dedicated to the proposition that we are all created equal,
is in good hands on our watch. 
</p>
<p>

One story would return America to the days of radical
laissez-faire, when there was no social contract and the strong
took what they could and the weak were left to forage. The other story
joins the memory of struggles that have been waged with the
possibility of victories yet to be won, including healthcare for
every American and a living wage for every worker. Like the mustard
seed to which Jesus compared the Kingdom of God, nurtured from small
beginnings in a soil thirsty for new roots, our story has been a long
time unfolding. It reminds us that the freedoms and rights we treasure
were not sent from heaven and did not grow on trees. They were, as John
Powers has written, "born of centuries of struggle by untold millions
who fought and bled and died to assure that the government can't just
walk into our bedrooms and read our mail, to protect ordinary people
from being overrun by massive corporations, to win a safety net against
the often-cruel workings of the market, to guarantee that businessmen
couldn't compel workers to work more than forty hours a week
without extra compensation, to make us free to criticize our
government without having our patriotism impugned, and to make sure that
our leaders are answerable to the people when they choose to send our
soldiers into war." The eight-hour day, the minimum wage, the
conservation of natural resources, free trade unions, old-age pensions,
clean air and water, safe food--all these began with citizens and won
the endorsement of the political class only after long struggles and
bitter attacks. Democracy works when people claim it as their own. 
</p>
<p>

It is only rarely remembered that the definition of democracy
immortalized by Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address had been inspired by
Theodore Parker, the abolitionist prophet. Driven from his pulpit,
Parker said, "I will go about and preach and lecture in the city and glen, by the roadside and field-side, and wherever men and women
may be found." He became the Hound of Freedom and helped to change
America through the power of the word. We have a story of equal power.
It is that the promise of America leaves no one out. Go now, and tell it
on the mountains. From the rooftops, tell it. From your laptops, tell
it. From the street corners and from Starbucks, from delis and from
diners, tell it. From the workplace and the bookstore, tell it. On
campus and at the mall, tell it. Tell it at the synagogue, sanctuary and
mosque. Tell it where you can, when you can and while you can--to every
candidate for office, to every talk-show host and pundit, to corporate
executives and schoolchildren. Tell it--for America's sake.
