The Chickenhawk-in-Chief is coming. We are to be visited next
week by Deadeye Dick Cheney, the most odious individual to hold the
office of US Vice-President since the criminal Spiro Agnew resigned
in disgrace from the Nixon administration.
<p>A little history to begin with: first the chicken. Asked in 1989
by <i>The Washington Post</i> why he had dodged the draft for the
Vietnam War, Cheney notoriously replied that "I had other
priorities in the '60s than military service".</p>
<p>Now the hawk. In recent years, his enthusiasm for military
service - other people's military service, that is - has multiplied
like anthrax. No man, not even George Bush, has done more to drive
the American disaster in Iraq.</p>

<p>Cheney was the first to trumpet the delusion that the September
11, 2001 terrorist atrocity was linked to Saddam Hussein. Fixated
on a punitive war in Iraq, he connived with his old buddy Donald
Rumsfeld at the Pentagon to set up a personal intelligence network
that would bypass the professional Washington spy agencies and
construct the casus belli he needed. Cherry-picking the evidence,
often relying on scheming Iraqi exiles with an axe to grind and
money to make, Cheney vigorously pushed the fabrication that the
Iraq dictator intended to attack the United States.</p>
<p>"We discovered &#133; the allegation that one of the lead
hijackers, Mohamed Atta, had, in fact, met with Iraqi intelligence
in Prague," he announced in March 2002.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass
destruction. There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use
against our friends, against our allies, and against us," he told
the Veterans of Foreign Wars in August 2002.</p>
<p>And then, a month later: "We do know, with absolute certainty
that [Saddam] is using his procurement system to acquire the
equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear
weapon."</p>
<p>But not to worry, the war of shock and awe would be a cakewalk.
"We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators," he assured NBC
television's <i>Meet The Press</i> in 2003, just days before the
invasion began.</p>
<p>All these and more of the Vice-President's lethal notions have
long since been exploded. Only a week ago, a Pentagon investigation
confirmed that the supposed Prague meeting between Atta and an
Iraqi agent never happened.</p>

<p>We know all about the non-existent WMDs. Cheney's claims about
Saddam's nuclear program have been comprehensively demolished. And
more than 3000 of the welcome "liberators" have been killed in
Iraq.</p><div class="pageprint" id="contentSwap2">
<p>The disastrous Rumsfeld was eventually fired, but Deadeye Dick
miraculously survives, more arrogant than ever. His critics, he
sneers, are "dishonest and reprehensible &#133; corrupt and
shameless".</p>
<p>WHILE the Chickenhawk's continuing lust for conflict in the
Middle East springs from mad-eyed neo-con fantasies, it has added
enormously to his personal fortune.</p>
<p>Before becoming Vice-President, Cheney was, for five years,
chairman and chief executive of Halliburton, the giant American
engineering and oil services company. On his watch, this company -
acting secretively through offshore corporate cut-outs - did many
millions of dollars worth of oil and construction business with
Iran and Iraq, in defiance of Clinton administration sanctions
against those countries. The corrupt Soeharto regime in Indonesia
was another favourite client.</p>
<p>In 1995, Halliburton quietly paid the US government a penalty of
$US3.8 million for illegally selling nuclear technology to Libya,
and in 2002, a subsidiary, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, had to cough
up $US2 million to settle a fraud case brought by the US Justice
Department. In 2003, the company forked out $US6 million in
compensation for "defective accounting practices".</p>
<p>Cheney, on leaving Halliburton to run for vice-president, was
given a golden handshake worth more than $US33.7 million. The
company has since won tens of billions of dollars worth of Pentagon
war contracts in Iraq from the Bush Administration, many awarded
without competitive tender, and several of which are under
investigation for serious fraud and overcharging.</p>
<p>Cheney maintains that he now has no connection with Halliburton,
that his stock is held in a blind trust. But for at least two years
of his vice-presidency, the company paid him hundreds of thousands
of dollars in "deferred compensation", a legal though arguably
smelly tax avoidance device. And Cheney has also worked his old
Halliburton connections to finesse the Bush Administration's oil,
energy and conservation policies in favour of big business.
Estimates of his current personal fortune, including Halliburton
stock, run from about $US30 million to as high as $US100
million.</p>

<p>This is the man who will be greeted with open arms by Howard,
Downer, Nelson and Co next week. They will be welcoming a deceitful
and dangerous spiv.</p>
<p>FOR a penetrating account of the Bush Administration's assault
on democracy and honesty, I can recommend a new book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159420098X?tag=commondreams-20/ref+nosim" target="_new">The
Greatest Story Ever Sold</a></i> (Penguin/Viking) by the excellent
<i>New York Times</i> columnist Frank Rich.</p>
</div><p>And there is a scorching account of the nefarious career of Dick
Cheney done for <i>The New York Review of Books</i> last year by
the writer Joan Didion, on the net at&#160;<a href=
"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19376" target="_new">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19376</a></p>
<p>When I told Rich on Wednesday that Cheney was visiting Down
Under, I got a pithy reply: "I hope you keep him."</p>
