<font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Two
catastrophes have been in the making since President Bush and Tony
Blair launched their war on Iraq four years ago. Both are epoch-making,
and their resolution will shape regional and world politics for decades
to come.</font><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">The
first catastrophe relates to the political and moral consequences of
the war in the US and UK, and its resolution is the urgent task facing
the American and British peoples. The second concerns the devastation
wrought by the war and subsequent occupation, and the lack of a unified
political movement within Iraq that might overcome it.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Bush
and Blair are in a state of denial, only offering us more of the same.
They allegedly launched the war at first to save the world from
Saddam's WMD, then to establish democracy, then to fight al-Qaida's
terrorism, and now to prevent civil war and Iranian or Syrian
intervention.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Four
years after declaring "mission accomplished", the US government is
sending more combat troops to add to the bloodbath - all in an effort
to impose its imperial will on the Iraqi people, and in the process
plunging its own country into its deepest political-moral crisis since
Vietnam. Under heavier pressures, Blair, the master of tactical
subterfuge, is redeploying Britain's forces within Iraq and
Afghanistan, under the guise of withdrawal. He has long known that
British bases in Basra and the south were defenceless against attacks
by the Sadr movement and others.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Bush,
on the other hand, is escalating Iraq's conflict and threatening to
launch a new war, this time against Iran. It is hard not to presume
that what he means by an exit strategy is to install a client regime in
Baghdad, backed by US bases. The Iraqi people will not accept this, and
the west should be alerted to the fact that US policy objectives will
only lead to wider regional conflicts, rather than to full withdrawal.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">In
attempting to achieve their objective, the occupation forces will
escalate their war with the resistance forces within and north of
Baghdad, as well as clashing with the popular Sadr movement in the
capital and the south. The latter is, despite the ceasefires and
political manoeuvrings, Iraq's biggest organised opposition force to
the occupation.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile,
the destruction of Iraq continues apace and its people are subjected to
levels of sustained violence unknown in their history. Overwhelmingly,
the violence is a direct or indirect product of the occupation, and the
bulk of sectarian violence is widely known in Iraq to be linked to the
parties favoured by Washington. For example, forces in control of the
various ministries, including the interior ministry, clash regularly.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">It
is not difficult to see how this violence is linked to the occupation,
for it has spawned a multitude of violence-makers: 150,000 occupation
forces; 50,000 and rising contracted foreign "mercenaries"; 150,000
Iraqi Facilities Protection forces, paid by the Iraqi regime,
controlled by the occupation and engaged in death-squad activities,
according to the prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki; 400,000 US-trained
army and police forces; six US-controlled secret Iraqi militias; and
hundreds of private kidnap gangs. Pitted against some or all of these
are tens of thousands of militias and resistance forces of various
political hues. In total there are about 2 million actively organised
armed men in the country. There are about 3,000 attacks on occupation
forces every month, while tens of thousands of Iraqis languish in
prison, where torture is widespread and trials considered an
unnecessary formality.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">The
success of the occupation's divide-and-rule tactics and their
insistence on basing the new political and military structures on
sects, religions, and ethnicities is threatening the communal cohesion
that was once the country's hallmark. This is a factor in the absence
of a united movement, capable of leading the struggle to end the
occupation. The occupation has sown divisions where there were none and
transformed existing differences into open warfare.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">And
is it any wonder that the long-suffering Iraqi people find themselves
at an impasse. Try catching your breath after decades of brutal
dictatorship, 13 years of economic sanctions and four years of an
obscene war .</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">But
even in the absence of a unified anti-occupation front, the resistance
of the Iraqi people has managed to thwart the world's greatest military
empire. And there are signs of a mass rejection of these sectarian
forces, and the possibility that public anger will translate into the
very unity that is so desperately needed. Rage against corruption and
the collapse of public services is sweeping the country, including
Kurdistan. Similarly, the proposed corporate occupation of Iraq,
disguised as a legal document to tie the country to the oil companies
for decades to come, has reminded the population of one of the main
reasons for the US-led invasion. It has also reminded them what a
self-respecting, sovereign Iraq looked like in 1961, when the
government nationalised Iraq's lands for future oil production.</font></p><p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">In
an opinion poll released by the BBC yesterday, 86% of people are
opposed to the division of Iraq. This and other polls also show
majority support for armed resistance to the occupation. Four years
into this terrible adventure, both the US and Britain must realise that
it is time to pack up and leave.</font>
