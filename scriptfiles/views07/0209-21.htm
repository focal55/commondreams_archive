Seventy-five percent of Ameri cans want negotiations
instead of war with Iran, but the Bush administration is
charging ahead. Once again, military preparations are being
paired with misinformation, and peaceful options are being
dismissed. This time, Americans must inform themselves and
take action before it is too late. 
<P> The fear and disinformation campaign is on. The
administration repeatedly asserts, without definitive
evidence, that Iran is developing a bomb, and the public is
buying it. Citing legitimate concerns with Iran's past
undeclared nuclear activity, Mohamed ElBaradei, director
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
monitors Iran, stated that "we haven't seen a
smoking gun in Iran." </P>
<P> According to the New Yorker's Seymour Hersh, a
recent, classified CIA report came to the same conclusion.
But regime change, not fact, is the administration's
goal. National Intelligence Director John Negroponte, who
estimated a 5-to-10-year window before Iran might have a
weapon, is being replaced. The Pentagon's study group
known as the "Iranian Directorate" will quash and
cherry-pick information, as was done on Iraq. This should
ring alarm bells. </P>
<P> The administration would also have us believe that Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, master of outrageous
statements, determines Iranian nuclear and foreign policy.
In fact, it's mainly determined by Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who issued a religious decree that
Iran shall reject nuclear weapons. Moreover, his newspaper
advised Ahmadinejad to stay out of nuclear issues.
Ahmadinejad is also rapidly losing support because
opposition leaders object to his policies and sanctions are
hurting. None of this gets mentioned by the Bush
administration, whose anti-Iranian rhetoric bolsters
Ahmadinejad. </P>
<P> Congress needs to shine a light on all this by demanding
access to undoctored CIA reports, interviewing ElBaradei and
Iran experts, and determining what type of inspections would
provide reasonable assurance about Iran's nuclear
programs. </P>
<P> An administration intent on forcible regime change could
easily take us to war. Risky provocation has already begun
with clandestine activities inside Iran, aggressive
kidnappings of Iranian nationals in Iraq and placement of a
massive offensive armada close to Iran's shores,
inviting clashes with Iranian ships. Any provoked skirmish
resulting in American casualties could trigger a
congressional war resolution. </P>
<P> Israel is another wild card. Its leaders have stated that
they may preemptively attack Iran's nuclear
installations even without U.S. approval. Bush has said he
"could understand" an Israeli attack, knowing
Congress would rally to Israel's support if Iran
counterattacks. </P>

<P> Finally, Bush could find some pretext to launch and then
announce a naval-air attack, regardless of congressional
concern. Some insiders say that plans are in place and that
the administration believes it has prior authorization.
Again, when Iran strikes back, Congress is not likely to
deny the president military support. </P>
<P> Prevention is urgent. Americans need to support
congressional resolutions, such as H.J. Res. 14, which seek
to prevent the president from attacking Iran without an
attack on America or its troops, or without congressional
authorization. These resolutions should also address
provocation and Israel. </P>
<P> Americans must force the Bush administration and Congress
to examine and openly disclose the disastrous consequences
of an attack on Iran. Incredibly, administration planners
may believe that air-naval attacks won't involve
American troops and will topple the Iranian regime. Military
and security experts, such as retired colonel and War
College teacher Sam Gardiner, totally disagree. They expect
slaughter of American troops in Iraq with more potent
weapons and attacks, disruption of oil supplies and
skyrocketing oil prices, more recruits for jihadists and
attacks on Israel. </P>
<P> Americans must reject the administration's fraudulent
choice between war or surrender. An overwhelming number of
Iran and national security experts, such as Flynt Leverett,
formerly a member of the CIA and National Security Council,
believe that negotiations with Iran on a wide variety of
issues (e.g. stabilizing Iraq, nuclear inspections,
Hezbollah, Hamas) could be productive. But the Bush
administration, blind to these opportunities, insists on
regime change and sets preconditions that doom negotiations
that might reduce tensions and violence in the Middle East. </P>
<P> The administration is intransigent. Its current policy is
catastrophic. Only the media and Congress, under public
pressure, can expose the flaws, explore the possibilities
for negotiation and stop the rush to war. </P>
