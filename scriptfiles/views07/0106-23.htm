<p>On December 31st I took my children to a daytime New Year's Eve 
celebration at a local museum.  There were crafts, snacks, and a 
balloon drop from the roof of the building each hour.  At 1:00 in the 
afternoon all the kids gathered on the museum lawn and looked 
expectantly at the employees perched high above, ready to shower them 
with balloons.  A young man brought out a bullhorn and announced a list 
of places around the world where it was now 2007 -- various countries 
in time zones eleven hours ahead of our own:  Russia, Kenya, 
Madagascar, Kuwait.  As the crowd counted down, balloons were dropped, 
and kids stampeded, I found myself pondering the countries that were 
read aloud, and realized that there was, at least to me, one glaring 
omission:  It was midnight in Iraq, with a new year beginning.

<p>Later, I looked at the top Google listing for "World Time Zones" and 
found that when sorted by time zones, Baghdad was indeed on the list 
with the other countries that had been named.  While I don't ascribe 
negative intentions in the failure to announce that it was New Year's 
in Iraq, I did feel saddened by the missed opportunity for compassion, 
for empathy, for connection -- not only with our own American soldiers 
away from home, but also with ordinary Iraqis.  To me, the incident 
seemed to illuminate our tendency to shield ourselves from both the bad 
and the good of Iraq.  It is much easier to deny our own complicity in 
this illegal and immoral war when real Iraqi lives are reduced to 
numbers streaming by on the television set:  numbers displaced, numbers 
dead.  Numbers are easier than names and faces, families and 
traditions, celebrations and bereavement, change and growth.

<p>The following day, January 1st, I attended what was to be a walk across 
the Golden Gate bridge marking the death of the 3000th American 
soldier, and the hundreds of thousands civilians killed in Iraq.  On my 
trip to the bridge, about a half-hour before the vigil began, I 
witnessed what seemed to be a horrible accident, with a woman hit by a 
car and dead on the freeway.  I thought of her children, her loved 
ones, her friends, and hoped that they had not had seen the accident, 
that they might be spared these last images of her.  I thought of the 
driver of the car that hit her, the image of him with his head in his 
hands in sorrow and pain.  And I hoped that all would be solaced and 
ultimately healed by their communities.

<p>As I walked the bridge, my mind moved between these events and images.  
I saw faces and families in both celebration and mourning, and tried to 
imagine the joys and sorrows, the hopes and dreams, the quirky habits, 
the mundane and intimate details that breathe life into each and every 
one of the numbers that we see, and too often ignore, day after day.  
Had the woman on the freeway toasted in the new year, made resolutions 
to be kept and broken?  Even amidst the chaos, were Iraqi families able 
to gather together, to sing and dance, to greet 2007 with the slightest 
bit of hope shimmering on the horizon?  How many of our soldiers 
counted down to a long-distance kiss and silent wish to come home?  And 
then, how many of each of these beings that celebrated (or not) the 
previous night, would make it through until tomorrow?  In 2007 how many 
children will watch their parents die needless deaths, how many parents 
will bury their children?

<p>I soon discovered that the woman on the freeway survived with 
relatively minor injuries.  Rather than become a statistic, hers was a 
life returned, renewed.  Will we be able to say the same for the 
children, the women and men, both Iraqi and American, who daily must 
live the horrific reality that our imperialism has wrought?
