I want to thank Gensuikyo for the privilege of participating in this year’s Bikini Day commemorations. The Bravo test marked the third nuclear attack against Japanese people. Worse, it was a racist assault against the people of Rongelap and of other Marshall Islands. The authors of that holocaust knew that winds would blow deadly radiation to Rongelap, and in the years since, this crime has been compounded by lies and programs like 4.1 which denied Bravo test victims essential medical relief while helping to refine the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
<P>Bikini Day commemorations also remind us of the courage of Marshall Island victims and their families and of Kuboyama-san’s unfulfilled hope of that he would be the last nuclear weapons victim.</P>
<P>President Putin of Russia recently had the temerity to say what many know: that the world’s nations feel insecure because the U.S. insists on enforcing a “unipolar” world:  “One single center of power. One single center of force. One single center of decision making. This is the world of one master, one sovereign.” The U.S., Putin said, has brought us “to the abyss of one conflict after another.”[1]</P>
<P>Despite the fact that the U.S. was the world’s dominant power throughout the 20th century and that “full spectrum dominance” – maintaining the ability to “dominate” any nation, anywhere on the planet, at any times – has been official U.S. policy for a decade, U.S. leaders universally decried this inconvenient truth as “cold war rhetoric.”</P>
<P>We need not admire of Putin or his autocracy or ignore General Baluyevsky’s threat to abrogate the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and rumors that Russia with back away from the START I Treaty to acknowledge the truth of his observation.[2] It explains why every U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt has prepared and threatened first strike nuclear attacks – most recently against Iraq, Iran and North Korea. The pursuit of global dominance explains why the U.S. has yet to fulfill Article VI of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or the thirteen steps agreed at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. It tells us why the Bush Administration is backing the “Complex 2030” project to expand the U.S. nuclear weapons production infrastructure and is pressing development of a new generation of nuclear weapons – the misnamed “Reliable Replacement Warheads.”</P>
<P>The US commitment to impose what Vice President Cheney called “the arrangement for the 21st century” explains why the U.S. military budget is greater than that of the rest of the world’s nation’s combined, and more than ten times greater than Beijing’s, Moscow’s, or Tokyo’s. The U.S. full spectrum dominance doctrine makes clear why there was near panic in U.S. elite circles when China demonstrated its anti-satellite missile capabilities. It explains why Washington is reorganizing and reinforcing its global infrastructure of military bases, especially in Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. It was to reconsolidate dominance of the oil-rich Middle East that the Bush Administration invaded and still occupies Iraq and is building permanent military bases there. Preserving its empire also explains why, having broken Iraq and precipitated its multi-dimensional civil war, the Bush Administration is organizing an alliance of Sunni Arab nations to challenge Shia Iran’s now growing influence.</P>
<P>In fact, the Bush wars, his Administration’s undermining of the NPT, its new nuclear weapons programs, and its nuclear threats are desperate attempts to resist a major dynamic now at work in the world: the relative decline of U.S. power and its empire. The 2004 U.S. National Intelligence Council Report predicted that “ The likely emergence of China and India, as well as others, as new major global players—similar to the advent of a united Germany in the 19th century and a powerful United States in the early 20th century—will transform the geopolitical landscape, with impacts potentially as dramatic as those in the previous two centuries.”[3]   Richard Hass, the State Department’s Director of Policy Planning in the first years of the Bush II government, calls “this the end of the American era in the Middle East – a moment comparable to the collapse of British and French influence in the region after the second world war.” With the mammoth U.S. national and trade deficits, the dollar is in a sharp decline and “is likely to get a lot cheaper.” At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland “America was somewhat peripheral,” while the “shift of power” toward “the rise of Asia (and implicitly, the decline of America and Europe)” was the focus of attention. And, across Asia, people “see the US losing its undisputed superpower status in 50 years, perhaps to China, amid waning trust in Washington to act responsibly in the world.”</P>
<P>If handled well, the loss of empire will be a boon to the US people and the world, but it could also pose severe economic and security dangers at home and internationally.</P>
<P>We suffer governments’ misrule only as long as our peoples provide them the support they need to stay in power. In November, the U.S. people opened the way for substantive political change by ousting Bush and Cheney’s Republican apologists from control of Congress. As Gensuikyo Secretary General Takakusaki Hiroshi put it, we began to turn back the worst of U.S. imperial tyranny. For the first time since 9-11, U.S. voters refused to dance to the tune of Bush-Cheney manipulation of their fears. The Republican defeat resulted from popular disgust with the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld war in Iraq. Despite Democrats’ conflicting proposals, they were seen as offering ways to end Iraq’s daily death tolls. There  were also successful referenda in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Chicago calling for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and since the election, the Vermont state legislature voted for “immediate orderly withdrawal.”[4]</P>
<P>Yet, because ours is not a parliamentary system that requires the President to maintain a Congressional majority, the world seems stuck with the worst president in U.S. history for two more very dangerous years. Bush has been weakened, but he retains the power to wreak death and vast destruction. Many of us are deeply concerned about U.S. and Israeli nuclear threats against Iran and the build up of U.S. offensive military power around Iran – including two nuclear-capable aircraft carriers, which Vice-President Cheney calls “a strong signal”.[5]</P>
<P>The November election and the 2008 presidential election campaign which has already begun, provide us with openings that we are seizing.     </P>
<P>The challenge in the Middle East extends beyond “troops out” of Iraq. Middle East oil is a central pillar of U.S. global dominance. And, because Iraq, whose boundaries were first drawn by Winston Churchill, long served as the Sunni barrier against Shia Islam and the Arab barrier against Persian influence, its destruction places U.S. Middle East client states and U.S. global domination in considerable jeopardy. Bush’s strategic blunder has extended Iranian influence across oil-rich southern Iraq and into Baghdad. And, as they face their repressed and disadvantaged populations, many Arab regimes from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to Egypt and Lebanon now worry about growing Iranian and Jihadist power.</P>
<P>Tragically, and perhaps criminally, instead of accepting the fig leaf proffered by the bi-partisan Iraq Study Group, which called for the U.S. to seek help in stabilizing Iraq through increased diplomacy – including dialog with Iran and Syria – and for reducing the U.S. military presence in Iraq, President Bush has escalated the war and increased pressure on Iran.</P>
<P>The dangers are not limited to Bush and Cheney, but are systemic. Most leading Democrats cannot imagine alternatives to U.S. Empire and full spectrum dominance.</P>
<P>The U.S. election placed Bush unilateralism on the defensive, but it will not substantively change U.S. nuclear doctrines and policies, the U.S. campaign to intimidate and contain China, or the influence of the military-industrial-complex.</P>
<P>Neither U.S. nuclear policies nor the NPT were debated during the November election. Soon after the election, most Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting to provide India nuclear fuel and technologies, further undermining the NPT. But, as the Gensuikyo delegation that visited New Hampshire in October learned, we are educating and organizing to prevent U.S. attacks against Iran, the expansion of the U.S. nuclear weapons production infrastructure, and development of a new generation of nuclear weapons.</P>
<P>To give you an idea of what we are doing, let me tell you how Anne Miller, who some will remember from last year’s World Conference in Hiroshima, made news two weeks ago in our campaign to “bird dog” presidential candidates.[6] During Hillary Clinton’s first campaign swing through New Hampshire, where the first presidential primary will be held, Anne caught her as she was leaving a rally. Anne asked why she had said “no options are off the table” in relation to Iran (which is also the position of another Democratic presidential aspirant, John Edwards.) How, Anne asked, could she “threaten nuclear genocide on another nation’s children.” Hillary responded that the U.S. cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran, and repeated that all options must remain on the table. When Anne asked about the role the U.S. is playing in spurring nuclear weapons proliferation with its nuclear arsenal and repeated nuclear threats, Hillary said she didn’t want to discuss it and walked away.</P>
<P>Anne had the last word. An article she wrote about the exchange appeared in the state’s largest newspaper and flew through cyberspace. She was also interviewed on a progressive radio program broadcast on more than 100 stations across the country.</P>
<P>The next day, Erin Placey, an AFSC intern who I hope to bring to Hiroshima next summer, had a question for Senator Barak Obama: What about “Reliable Replacement Warheads” and Complex 2030.  The Senator was non-committal but said that he understood US NPT obligations.</P>
<P>In truth, almost all the political oxygen in the U.S. is now being absorbed by Iraq. This leaves only a sector of the U.S. peace movement to work for nuclear weapons abolition, but we can make a difference, beginning with the defeat of Complex 2030 and the “Reliable Replacement Warhead.” In a report that is influencing Congress (and which inspires as much fear as hope,) the U.S. Government Accountability Office has stated that the new weapons are not necessary because the plutonium in existing nuclear weapons will not deteriorate significantly for 100 years. At a time of growing U.S. deficits, the program’s $150 billion price tag is daunting. In addition, Linton Brooks, the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, a powerful advocate of more “usable” nuclear weapons, was fired for security breaches at Los Alamos. It will be difficult for Bush to replace him. Even RRW supporters are backing off, because the NNSA has been unable to develop an acceptable design for the new bombs. And, with the Bush Administration approaching its last years, many in Congress are asking why develop the RRW now.</P>
<P>Even if we defeat “Complex 2030” and the RRW, the fact that they have been supported by the Bush Administration and the Pentagon further undermines the NPT. The NPT is certainly imperfect, but after years of the U.S. and other nuclear powers ignoring their Article VI obligations, a growing number in the U.S. elite recognize that the dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation have become so great that the only alternative is nuclear weapons abolition.</P>
<P>In a remarkable Wall Street Journal article,  the war criminal Henry Kissinger, joined by former Secretary of State George Shultz, former Secretary of Defense Perry, and former Senator Sam Nunn warned that “reliance on nuclear weapons…is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective.” They reminded the U.S. elite that “the Non-Proliferation treaty envisioned the end of all nuclear weapons”, and they urged that “First and foremost is intensive work with leaders of the countries in possession of nuclear weapons to turn the goal of a world without nuclear weapons into a joint enterprise.” This, they advised would “lend additional weight to efforts…to avoid the emergence of a nuclear-armed North Korea and Iran.”  Reading between the lines, they warned that U.S. refusal to implement the 13 steps agreed during the 2000 NPT Review Conference and the Bush Administration’s sabotage of the 2005 Review Conference have been self-defeating.[7]</P>
<P>Just as the late 1970s and early 1980s divisions within U.S. elite over the dangers of deploying “Euromissiles” precipitated the global movement that prevented their deployment and contributed mightily to the end of the Cold War, we need to seize the opportunities reflected in the Wall Street Journal article.</P>
<P>The recent U.S. agreement with North Korea will not silence demands for more fundamental nuclear disarmament in Korea and globally. It will decrease tensions in Northeast Asia, but it is too little too late. Had the Bush Administration not derailed the near-complete agreement it inherited from the Clinton Administration; had it not waited six years to engage Pyongyang in bi-lateral negotiations (as it did in Berlin in December;) had it not arrogantly demanded that North Korea eliminate its nuclear arsenal and weapons program before it would lift economic sanctions, provide essential energy resources, and engage in negotiations to normalize relations, Kim Jung Il would not have had six years to augment his nuclear arsenal which, in turn, reinforced Japanese ultra-nationalist political leaders. Nor would Korea’s nuclear program have encouraged other nations, including Iran, to follow in its stead.</P>
<P>We must be realists as well as idealists. Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Bikini and many other nuclear atrocities have become essential to the human condition. And, even as more people understand the imperatives of abolition, the dangers of nuclear war are increasing. Last month, to warn the world Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the hands of its Doomsday Clock forward to five minutes to midnight.[8]</P>
<P>At the core of this existential threat is the U.S. nuclear arsenal which serves as the “cornerstone” of its policies. With marginal exceptions, all of the politicians aspiring to become the next “ruler of the world”[9] – the next U.S. president - lack the courage to speak the truth that “human beings cannot coexist with nuclear weapons.” None have pledged to fulfill NPT commitments. We are also immediately challenged the “strong signal” Vice-President Cheney has sent to Iran.[10]  North Korea still possesses up to eight unreliable nuclear weapons. China maintains a “minimum deterrent force”, and Russia is developing a new generation of nuclear-capable missiles.</P>
<P>Here, there are many tons of weapons-grade plutonium and missiles that can reach the moon and calls for Japan to become a nuclear weapons state with a first-strike policy. While LDP leaders reassure us that they have “no nuclear intentions,” Prime Minister Abe, who once called for Japan to become a nuclear power, reiterates that a “beautiful Japan” means “break[ing] away from the postwar regime.” Shoichi Nakagawa, of the LDP’s policy research council, broke no new ground when he said that “debate over whether to go nuclear [is] necessary.” And Foreign minister Aso has asserted that the peace constitution “does not forbid possession of an atomic bomb.”[11]</P>
<P>In the U.S., even as we work to change U.S. policy toward East Asia and the Pacific, pressing multi-level engagement – not military containment – of China, press for our government to take up Beijing’s call for a new treaty to prevent weaponization of space, and work reverse the surge in construction of new U.S. military bases, we face the immediacy of the U.S. war in Iraq and U.S. threats against Iran.</P>
<P>Last month, building on the November election mandate, more than 100,000 of us marched on Washington and more than 1,000 lobbied in Congressional offices demanding the return of U.S. warriors from Iraq, now. This will mean a costly diminution in U.S. Middle East hegemony, but the U.S. initiated and lost the war in Iraq, and there are consequences for committing “the greatest strategic blunder” in a nation’s history.</P>
<P>We also must prevent U.S. or Israeli nuclear or “conventional” attacks against Iran. Such attacks, nuclear or conventional, would be disasters for the US people, for Israel, and for their allies, as well as for the Iranian people. In the U.S., working to prevent war against Iran also opens the way for us to teach the lesson that diplomacy and fulfilling U.S. NPT Article VI commitments – not building more nuclear weapons and threatening nuclear attacks – are the best way to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation and to ensure human survival.</P>
<P>As with Anne Miller’s and Eric Placey’s initiatives, hammering away at what most people understand immediate threat provides openings to defeat the Bush campaign to expand the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, to build still more genocidal nuclear weapons, and allow us to put the 13 steps onto the national political agenda.</P>
<P>The Japanese peace movement has long inspired abolitionists around the world. The proposed Declaration of a Nuclear Weapons Free Japan is an important next step to help Japan fulfill its historic obligations as the world’s first A-bombed nation. It will help to reverse the crisis of confidence in the NPT caused by the U.S. and other nuclear powers. Such a Declaration would add momentum for the next steps toward denuclearizing North Korea and contribute to the creation of a Northeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free zone. Perhaps most importantly, it will augment the forces of moral suasion, which are the ultimate foundation of a nuclear weapons free world.</P>
<P>A Nuclear Weapons Free Japan declaration could have other important implications: making the Kobe Nuclear Free Formula national policy, liberating Japan from the U.S. “nuclear umbrella” which is really a foreign policy based on U.S. genocidal first strike nuclear threats, and would encourage Japan to join the New Agenda Coalition, the Nonaligned Movement and much of the rest of the non-nuclear world in demanding that the U.S. and other nuclear powers finally fulfill their NPT and international law obligations to eliminate their genocidal nuclear arsenals.</P>
<P>Let me conclude by building on calls made by leading South Asian nuclear weapons abolitionists: Zia Mian, M.V. Ramana, Sulka Sen, and others to prevent the implementation of the recent U.S.-Indian nuclear agreement. By promising nuclear India fuel for its nuclear reactors, the U.S. is removing one of the most effective methods for limiting nuclear weapons proliferation is again dangerously demonstrating its double standards. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Japanese government can vote against providing India access to nuclear fuel it needs to generate nuclear power for energy consumption and to build still more nuclear weapons. If Japan votes to send additional fissile material to India, it will contribute to augmenting India’s nuclear arsenal and the dangers of nuclear war. Joining the U.S. in its despicable nuclear hypocrisy can only encourage Iran, Jordan, Gulf States,[12] Brazil and other nations to go nuclear, increasing the likelihood that this and future generations will have to endure still more Hiroshimas and Nagasakis.</P>
<P>The path before us is clear. Remembering Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini, let us continue our journey and campaign for nuclear weapons abolition with new resolve.</P>
