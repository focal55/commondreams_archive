<p> IF YOU HATED IT the first time, you might like the sequel better.</p>
<p>Remember Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the right-wing goon squad whose
defamatory insinuations helped sink John Kerry's presidential campaign?
They're back! This afternoon, key Swift boaters George "Bud" Day, Mary
Jane McManus and Carlton Sherwood are holding a little reunion, in the
guise of a panel discussion at the American Conservative Union's annual
Conservative Political Action Conference. The panel topic? "The Left's
Repeated Campaign Against the American Soldier."
<p>It's
not hard to visualize the right-wing talking points that will emerge
from this. The Swift boaters will be dusting off their 2004 scripts and
reaching back still further to dredge up their Vietnam-era notes.
Expect to see all the old myths revived: The antiwar left spits on
returning troops and gives aid and comfort to the enemy. Oh, John
Murtha, why do you hate our brave troops?</p>
<p>The
reemergence of the Swifties is depressing, but not because they're
likely to do much damage to progressive candidates in the next election
cycle. "Swift Boat II: The Sequel" will have a different ending from
"Swift Boat I" because Americans just aren't that dumb. </p>
<p>Polls
show the American public — and the troops themselves — to be deeply
critical of the Bush administration's handling of Iraq and concerned
about the war's devastating effect on the American military. We've
watched the situation in Iraq go from bad to worse, from worse to worst
and then from worst to unthinkably awful, as "insecurity" morphed into
"sectarian violence," then into chaos and civil war. </p>
<p>We've
seen the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq roughly tripled since the
2004 election. We've seen the war in Iraq fuel anti-U.S. sentiment
worldwide; we've seen copycat suicide bombings increase in Afghanistan;
we've seen the Iraq conflict further inflame tensions with Iran and
throughout the Middle East; we've seen hostile states around the globe
emboldened by the image of the U.S. caught in a quagmire; we've seen Al
Qaeda regroup; we've seen Iraq become a top training ground for
aspiring terrorists from all over. </p>
<p>Most of all, we've seen the
Bush administration consistently place ideology over reality, remaining
willfully blind to the fact that its ill-conceived war is making us
less secure — and breaking the back of the American military. If
there's a "campaign against the American soldier," it's the
administration that's been engaged in that campaign, not "the left" —
and by now, most Americans know it. </p>
<p>What's depressing about
the reemergence of the Swifties, though, is that it's symbolic of the
increasing takeover of the "conservative" movement by unprincipled,
right-wing extremists. </p>
<p>The Swifties began as a fringe group.
Their anti-Kerry attack ads were effective in 2004 (thanks in part to
Kerry's slowness in responding), but they were condemned universally as
a new low in the history of bottom-feeding smear campaigns. John McCain
criticized them as "dishonest and dishonorable," and the Bush campaign
sought to distance itself from the group's tactics. Association with
the Swifties forced the resignations of two Bush campaign aides,
including Ben Ginsburg, the campaign's top election law expert. </p>
<p>So
why has the Conservative Political Action Conference resuscitated
several already discredited Swifties for an inflammatory panel? </p>
<p>The
conference — cosponsored by more than 70 conservative groups and with
an audience likely to exceed 5,000 this year — has long been a showcase
for the heart and soul of American conservatism. Each year it attracts
top White House officials and Republican presidential hopefuls (this
year, big-name speakers include Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, Mike Huckabee,
Rudy Giuliani, Sam Brownback, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney). </p>
<p>The
inclusion of Swift boat operatives on the CPAC agenda demonstrates the
continued radicalization of the conservative movement, which seems
determined to render itself irrelevant. Yesterday's fringe has become
today's conservative mainstream. The Washington Times, one of the
right's main media outlets, approvingly refers to "The Left's Repeated
Campaign Against the American Soldier" as "one of the more timely
titles of CPAC's slate of panel discussions." </p>
<p>Of course, the
Swifties' presence on the agenda is hardly the only evidence that the
lunatics have taken over the asylum at CPAC. Other giveaways include
some unintentionally humorous agenda items: Oliver North — he of the
Iran-Contra scandal — will be presenting the "Defender of the
Constitution Award," for instance, while right-wing attack blogger
Michelle Malkin, whose work has been repeatedly criticized for its
cavalier attitude toward facts, gets the "Accuracy in Media Award."</p>
<p>All this is bad news for the conservative movement, which will only
become more marginal if it continues to embrace its lunatic fringe. But
it's probably good for progressives, who stand to gain the most from
conservatism's self-destruction.
