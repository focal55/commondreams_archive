Toward the end of <EM>Travels With Charley</EM> Steinbeck makes this 
observation: &#8220;My own journey started long before I left, and was over before I 
returned. I know exactly where and when it was over. Near Abingdon, in the 
dog-leg of Virginia , at four o&#8217;clock of a windy afternoon, without warning or 
good-by or kiss my foot, my journey went away and left me stranded far from 
home. I tried to call it back, to catch it up&#8212;a foolish and hopeless matter, 
because it was definitely and permanently over and finished.&#8221; Anyone who&#8217;s taken 
a long journey knows what Steinbeck is talking about. It isn&#8217;t always the end 
point of a journey that determines its end, nor is it ever the person who takes 
the journey who determines it. The same can be said of presidencies. Some of 
them begin long before inauguration day. Bill Clinton&#8217;s began sometime in late 
summer, about the time when Maureen Dowd noticed that the elder Bush just wasn&#8217;t 
interested anymore. &#8220;This,&#8221; she wrote in a <A

lid="Sept. 6, 1992 dispatch co-written with Thomas Friedman">Sept. 6, 1992 
dispatch co-written with Thomas Friedman</A>, &#8220;may be the first Administration 
in history that is scrambling for its first-100-days plan in its last 60 days 
before facing the voters.&#8221; Johnson&#8217;s presidency ended in February 1968, Jimmy 
Carter&#8217;s on April 24, 1980, when eight servicemen were killed in the Iranian 
desert as an attempt to rescue the 52 American hostages held in Teheran 
disintegrated in a sand storm, and Reagan&#8217;s ended in Reykjavik in 1987, when he 
was about to sign away the American nuclear weapons arsenal in an abolitionist 
deal with Gorbachev. His aides stepped in and ensured that he&#8217;d be nothing more 
than the acting president for the remainder of his scandal-ridden term.
<P>The second Bush&#8217;s administration unfortunately began early, too, on that 
turbid Election Night in 2000 when Fox News set the tone of the unmaking of 
Gore&#8217;s legitimate win and the Supreme Court sealed the fix thirty-six days 
later. But if W.&#8217;s presidency started more than two months too soon, it ended 
two years early. </P>
<P>Bush&#8217;s Abingdon was <A

lid="his January 10 speech">his January 10 speech</A>, the so-called &#8220;surge&#8221; 
speech. It became evident then why he couldn&#8217;t make up his mind before Christmas 
about what to say, let alone how to say it. He <EM>had</EM> nothing to say: His 
administration was in disarray, his policies bankrupt, his integrity a nightly 
punch-line. Even his beloved speech-writer was gone, <A

lid="loyal no more">loyal no more</A>. Not long from now when the stories begin 
to creep out about these final days of the Bush junta we&#8217;ll be told that the 
White House was a menagerie of chaos and backbiting, of uncontrolled tempers and 
lusted-after booze. We&#8217;ll discovered to what extent the nation&#8217;s business was 
unmoored and the nation&#8217;s executive off his rockers, his wife or maybe his dog, 
or an obscure corporate friend, his last remaining link with reality. His 
advisers either inflated his bubble or betrayed him, or both, if the advisers in 
question are Condoleezza Rice and Karen Hughes, the two who had his trust and 
could have made a difference. The January 10 speech proved that neither they nor 
Bush were interested in recasting the last two years of the presidency into a 
workable surge of its own, the way even Clinton managed to do despite the 
Lewinsky affair (and the Clinton presidency, as we&#8217;ll also discover, has yet to 
end). </P>
<P>The State of the Union confirmed the drift announced on January 10. The 
proposal on energy&#8212;cutting gasoline consumption by 20 percent from projected 
consumption in 2017&#8212;is a non-binding promise that rests on undeveloped 
technologies. Improving fuel efficiency is a great idea, if only it weren&#8217;t two 
decades too late, if it wasn&#8217;t so timid (one mile per gallon in improved 
efficiency per year, for just a few years), if Bush hadn&#8217;t been so opposed to 
the idea in the last six years. His desperation was clearest in his appeals for 
bi-partisanship, a notion no other president in the twentieth century worked so 
hard to demolish after making it the centerpiece of his inaugural in 2001. But 
we knew even then that he was a liar of magnificent proportions. He was the man 
who&#8217;d spent the electoral campaign selling the public on his massive tax cuts 
while promising to save entitlement programs and pay down the national debt. It 
wasn&#8217;t his fault that the public bought the lie whole, though, le t&#8217;s always 
remember, the majority of the public never did. </P>
<P>Resigning would be too statesmanlike an act for a man who likes to rule by 
edicts, and to whom power is its own reward. So we&#8217;ll spend the next two years 
sustaining his chaotic clock-running, watching the flashpoints of disasters he 
lit up spread their fires from Iraq to Afghanistan to Iran to North Korea, 
watching the promises he made about New Orleans sink in a flood of indifference 
and government incompetence, watch the machinery of government, corrupted by his 
years of nepotism and contempt, become its self-fulfilling prophecy of 
shoddiness and mistrust. The damage done by the Bush junta in the last six years 
may yet be outdone by the damage of the next two, because at least in the last 
six there was the hint that some of the criminals involved in the mugging 
believed in what they were doing, Bush among them. The faith-based business, 
remember. Now the worst part of the end of the Bush presidency, the most 
palpable part of that end, as we saw it on January 10 and again in th e State of 
the Union , is that Bush himself, like his father in 1992, no longer believes. 
He&#8217;s given up. He quit. As he has always quit. What&#8217;s left is the old shell, the 
reconstructed drunk without a goal, the resentful loser. And there&#8217;s nothing 
more dangerous when he remains, all ridicule aside, the &#8220;decider&#8221; and worse: the 
commander-in-chief. </P>
