<P>It seems ironic that U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who was listed on 
Nixon's Enemies List, will be the one wielding the gavel in another search for 
the truth at a time when so many of us have begun to wonder whether our 
government is capable of providing us with the truth. 
<P>One of the tragic moments in American history occurred in November 1973. 
This was the famous "Saturday Night Massacre," when President Richard Nixon, 
faced with the demand for incriminating tapes and documents by Watergate 
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, took an action that would lead to his 
resignation from the presidency in disgrace less than a year later. Nixon 
ordered U.S. Attorney General Elliott Richardson to fire Cox. When Richardson 
refused and instead resigned, as did his second in command, William 
Ruckelshaus, U.S. Solicitor General Robert Bork stepped up to fire Cox. 
<P>That action triggered a tough inquiry into the Watergate scandal by the 
House Judiciary Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Peter Rodino, a mild-mannered 
congressman from New Jersey. In July 1974, after seven months of public 
hearings, the committee in a bipartisan vote adopted several articles of 
impeachment, the chief of which was for obstruction of justice. Nixon had 
ordered the FBI to cease its inquiry into the money trail the CIA had 
discovered, leading from the president's personal lawyer, Herb Kalmbach, 
through various hands to pay off the Watergate burglary's mastermind, E. Howard 
Hunt. Hunt had threatened to reveal the details of the burglary to U.S. 
District Court Judge John Sirica, who presided over the Watergate case, unless 
he was paid. 
<P>One of the younger members of the Judiciary Committee at the time was 
Conyers, a man Nixon had put on his notorious "Enemies List" for whatever 
punishment federal agencies such as the IRS might devise. 
<P>As a result of the Judiciary Committee's inquiries and the work of several 
dedicated U.S. attorneys, not only was Nixon forced from office, but his 
attorney general, John Mitchell, was indicted and sent to jail for his part in 
the Watergate coverup. 
<P>Now, 32 years later, another Republican attorney general, Alberto 
Gonzales, faces questioning by both the Senate and House Judiciary committees, 
on grounds that he has used his high office for political purposes to remove 
eight U.S. attorneys, several of whom had been involved in investigations of 
Republican congressmen, such as Randy "Duke" Cunningham of San Diego, Robert 
Ney of Ohio and John Doolittle of Rocklin (Placer County). 
<P>And who chairs the Judiciary Committee today? None other than Nixon's old 
enemy, John Conyers. 
<P>Among the reasons many Americans have lost faith in their government, the 
perceived use of the U.S. attorney general's office for political purposes 
looms large. In the past, independent prosecutors, such as San Francisco's John 
Keker, who prosecuted Lt. Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra scandal, and 
former Chicago U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, who is the chief prosecutor in 
the Lewis "Scooter" Libby trial, have preserved respect for the judicial 
process despite the machinations of political appointees in Washington. Under 
the Bush administration, however, the White House has been able to convince its 
attorney general to provide questionable legal opinions on the use of torture, 
warrantless wire-tapping and other practices that cause ordinary citizens to 
wonder whether government lawyers, like politicians, can be prevailed upon to 
change their views for political gain.  
<P>The investigations now being conducted by both the House and Senate 
Judiciary committees can go a long way toward restoring the faith of the people 
that our nation's courts, laws and prosecutors remain untainted by political 
influence. Having served with Conyers for some 15 years, I would not want to be 
in the shoes of Attorney General Gonzales when he is asked to stand and swear 
to tell the truth about the recent wave of firings of U.S. attorneys, at least 
eight of whom were presiding over public corruption investigations. 
<P>The truth will out and justice will be served.

<P><I>Pete McCloskey, who farms in Rumsey (Yolo County), represented the San Francisco Peninsula in Congress between 1967 and 1982. A Republican and former deputy district attorney, he made the first speech on the floor of the House on June 6, 1973, calling for impeachment of President Richard Nixon for obstruction of justice.</I>
