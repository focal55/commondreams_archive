Every Saturday for the last four years, they've stood at the intersection of Braddock and Forbes avenues by Frick Park waging peace.
<P>
Weather has never been an issue. They stand their ground despite brutal cold and demoralizing heat.<P>
Last Saturday brought a bone-chilling rain that didn't let up. Still, 18 showed up, covering all four corners with signs extolling the virtues of dissent. They've been at it even before the invasion of Iraq began.<P>
They are a motley, but highly principled, band of former and current public school teachers, clergy, labor activists, lawyers, military veterans, rape crisis counselors, artists, homemakers and assorted citizens who have been on one journey or another their whole life.<P>

Most are closer to 55 than 35 and would have gravitated toward the more responsible end of the hippie spectrum in their youth.<P>
They are not anarchists. Their patriotism just happens to run deeper than the magnetic ribbons on the trunks of most people's cars.<P>
Wilkinsburg resident George Edwards, 88, stood proudly in the rain with a "Bring our troops home" sign around his neck.<P>
"I started [protesting] the week the war started," Mr. Edwards, a retired steel worker and World War II veteran, said.<P>
His friend, Milt Wolfson of Munhall, also fought in the war. Mr. Wolfson was an airman stationed in Britain whose job was to bomb German coal plants manufacturing gasoline.<P>
"I was a pacifist when I enlisted," Mr. Wolfson, 89, said, "but I decided it was more important to get rid of Hitler."<P>
Mr. Wolfson doesn't see any parallels between that "good war" and President Bush's war on terror.<P>
When Dec. 25 fell on a Saturday two years ago, Regent Square resident Genevieve Davidson and her daughter, who now lives in Seattle, showed up with signs calling for the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq when most people were home unwrapping gifts.<P>
Though alone at the intersection that afternoon, they thought someone should commemorate the birth of the Prince of Peace in a way that wouldn't collapse under the weight of holiday irony.<P>

As far as they were concerned, the real war against Christmas was being waged by the U.S. government, not "secular progressives."<P>
"People used to yell out of their window 'Get a job,' " Ms. Davidson said with a laugh. "I have a job. This is what I do on my day off. This is one of the most important things I've ever done."<P>
When patriotism was riding high in America and expectations of a quick, cheap war was conventional wisdom, the protesters were already carrying signs many considered seditious: "Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?"<P>
Every Saturday they gather with the hope that a vigil the following Saturday won't be necessary -- but it always is. They know they will carry signs until the last American soldier comes home from Iraq.<P>
They don't call themselves anything in particular, though they've been called plenty by irate drivers who have taken offense at their "disloyalty" over the years.<P>
"I'll be glad to buy you a one-way ticket [over there]," one man in a gray SUV shouted as he made the turn onto Braddock.<P>
Other than another driver who flashed his middle finger, it was the only sign of public hostility during the group's one-hour protest at noon last Saturday.<P>
"More people honk [in support] now than in the beginning," said Karen Waggoner, an Oakland-based photographer who helps organize and publicize the vigils.<P>
Ms. Waggoner believes diehard supporters of the war are beginning to realize they're not in the majority anymore.<P>

A man from the neighborhood who used to heckle them in the beginning has either given up, moved to another cause or come to his senses.<P>
"Most people don't do anything," Ms. Waggoner said. "Those are the people we're trying to reach."<P>
When the vigil at Forbes and Braddock ends, another protest sponsored by Black Voices for Peace begins promptly at 1 p.m. at Highland and Penn avenues in East Liberty.<P>
The protest in front of the imposing edifice of East Liberty Presbyterian Church attracted 28 people despite the rain.<P>
Longtime activists Gail Austin and Fred Logan help organize the weekly protest of mostly black citizens which, like the Regent Square vigil, began before the war.<P>
"It's great to see a multiracial, multicultural group of people protesting the war," said Greg Swiderski, 61, a chaplain at the Sisters of Divine Providence in McCandless who often stands on the corner with them. "It would be good to see some young people -- but there's no draft."
