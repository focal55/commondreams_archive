<p>On the night of April 4, 1972, when it had become clear that he had won the Wisconsin primary that would put him on the road to securing the Democratic presidential nomination, George McGovern began his victory speech with a reference to &quot;my most devoted campaigner&quot;: Eleanor McGovern, his wife, ideological soul mate and political confidante.
<p>Candidates usually thank their spouses. But, in McGovern&#39;s case, he was doing more than merely recognizing a loved one. He was stating a fact of his campaign: Eleanor McGovern was his most devoted campaigner. She was, as well, a path-breaking political player in her own right. And her death last week at the age of 85 robs American politics of a definitional figure.</p><p>We&#39;ve lost too many good friends in the past few days, including Molly Ivins, whose columns graced these pages for many years, and Father Robert Drinan, the former Massachusetts congressman who worked so closely with our own Bob Kastenmeier on the House Judiciary Committee to impeach Richard Nixon and restore a measure of checks and balances to an endangered republic.</p><p>But we wanted to take a moment to reflect on the special contribution of Eleanor McGovern, who spent so much time in Madison. It was here that she experienced the great joys of her husband&#39;s political progress and the great sorrow of her daughter Terry&#39;s passing. It was here that she forged friendships that would last a lifetime. And it was here that she found so much enthusiastic support for the role she chose to play as an outspoken and influential national political figure.</p><p>Before Eleanor McGovern came along, the wives of presidential candidates had been content to stand quietly at the sides of their husbands and, perhaps, to host a ladies lunch. Even Eleanor Roosevelt, the most important and active first lady in American history, had been a relatively cautious player during her husband Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#39;s first presidential campaign in 1932.</p><p>Forty years later, another Eleanor threw caution to the wind. She hit the trail on her own, going to towns her husband could not reach, writing and delivering her own speeches and holding her own with the press. She was the first wife of a presidential candidate to make a solo appearance on NBC-TV&#39;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; answering policy questions without hesitation and in precise detail.</p><p>George McGovern recognized the asset Eleanor was. When he announced his candidacy for the presidency in January 1971, McGovern opened his remarks by saying: &quot;My wife Eleanor and I have come home to South Dakota to make this announcement because here <em>we</em> shaped our basic political faith; here <em>we</em> were given the opportunity of public service. <em>We</em> are grateful for that opportunity and for your faith. <em>We</em> shall conduct this new effort to the honor of South Dakota, the nation, and ourselves.&quot;</p><p>At the close of the campaign, McGovern spoke again of Eleanor, and of the couple&#39;s shared &quot;dedication to the noble ideals of this country.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<em>We</em> have found the greatest outpouring of energy and love that any political effort has ever inspired, as least in my lifetime,&quot; said McGovern, whose campaign would remain the touchstone for tens of thousands of progressives who came to know the sorrows and joys of the political process during the course of that remarkable 1972 race.</p><p>George McGovern knew that the love he experienced during the campaign was shared with Eleanor, just as those inspired by the campaign knew Eleanor not as a mere &quot;political wife&quot; but as a political player in her own right. She will be missed by all who knew her, including many friends in Wisconsin, a state that embraced both McGoverns well and wisely in 1972 and the years that followed - years when so many of us came to recognize how much the United States lost when George McGovern did not become this country&#39;s president and Eleanor McGovern its first lady.</p>
