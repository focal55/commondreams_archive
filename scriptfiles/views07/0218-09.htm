<p>The sequence of unsuccessful attempts to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians tracks the history of missed opportunities. But the recent agreement in Makkah between Fatah and Hamas on the creation of a unity government offers the possibility to change course, and provides the US with the unique chance to assert seriously its role for peace in the region.
<p>The agreement between the Palestinian factions has been met with widespread caution, if not scepticism. For too long, both factions had been unable to reach an understanding, and several points of contention remain unresolved. Rather than stressing the negative aspects, all parties concerned, including Israel, should see it as the special opportunity it really is.
<p>The resumption of aid to the Palestinians by both the European Union and the US would contribute to an immediate improvement in the lives of Palestinians, who have been unduly punished by the suspension of aid and a persistent state of confrontation. As Ghazi Hamad, a spokesman for the Hamas government has stated, “?this (international aid) is the only way to have stability in the region.”  
<p>Acceptance of the accord as a point to move forward will also benefit Israel, whose leaders have reacted cautiously to the agreement. For many years, Israel has insisted that it has no partner to deal on the Palestinian side. Now it has.
<p>Prime Minister Olmert insists that the new Palestinian government should accept the conditions set by the Quartet of Middle East peace, namely, a cessation of violence, acceptance of previous accords and the recognition of the State of Israel’s right to exist.
<p>However, both Israelis and Palestinians have already violated those conditions. They have both resorted to violence, and have ignored previous agreements. As for the recognition of the State of Israel, Israel exists whether the Palestinians want it or not. What it doesn’t exist is a Palestinian state. 
<p>So the actual demand should be for Israel to recognise a Palestinian state according to the internationally agreed pre-1967 borders and with the basic requirements that this implies: no foreign presence in the Palestinian territories and security controls pursuant to mutually agreed and internationally supervised conditions.
<p>This agreement between Hamas and Fatah represents the wishes of most Palestinians. A refusal to deal with the new Palestinian government will be interpreted in the Arab world as a new refusal by the West to deal fairly with the Palestinian issue. 
<p>Dennis Ross, a Middle East envoy for two American presidents, dismissed the accord as not being good enough to lay out a new political horizon. He said that the agreement is a blow to Secretary Rice’s efforts for peace in the region. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, by contrast, called the agreement a ‘very important step forward,’ and stated his hope that the agreement will curb the violence, creating a better future for the Palestinian people.
<p>A refusal by the West to deal with the new Palestinian government will only worsen the already desperate situation of most Palestinians, and will strengthen their conviction that it is useless to expect a fair deal from the international community. This sentiment prevailing in the Arab world will unnecessarily prolong violence and make the prospects for peace in the region even dimmer. In more stark terms, how to deal with the new situation will be a choice between war and peace.
