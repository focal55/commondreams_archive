<p>Last week, I attended a reunion of "The 51st State," a robust, local 
public television news and public affairs program that graced the 
airwaves of New York City's Channel Thirteen back in the early 1970's. 
I didn't have the pleasure of working on the show -- it went off the 
air shortly after my arrival in Manhattan -- but a lot of my friends 
and colleagues did, and it was a treat to see all of them again.

<p>The reason for the gathering was the launch of an effort by Thirteen to 
rescue and restore old videotape from its four-and-a-half decade past. 
Better late than never. Over the years, as a frequent public television 
writer/producer and a sometime television historian, I've bemoaned the 
loss of thousands of hours of videotape, significant history, much of 
it erased or simply tossed into dumpsters.

<p>Clips were shown from old "51st State" broadcasts, eliciting hoots of 
recognition, laughter, pride and not a few tears. What we saw was a 
raucous, lively, offbeat, iconoclastic, funny, rough and tumble TV 
program, a newscast not unlike the city it covered but totally unlike 
any local television news show since.

<p>That's a pity, and its says volumes not only about the current state of 
local TV news but the state of public broadcasting in America, which 
has perpetually struggled to recapture the spirit of its early days; 
the ragged-edge innovation, willingness to take risks, the opportunity 
for all kinds of people to participate in the creation of programming 
that reflected a panoply of their interests and concerns.

<p>The problem, of course, is financing. The old joke in public 
broadcasting: the good news is, you've got partial funding; the bad 
news is, you've got partial funding.

<p>There are wonderful, probing public television series such as 
"Frontline," "NOW," "P.O.V." and "Wide Angle." "The Newshour with Jim 
Lehrer," in its 32nd year, continues to provide valuable perspective on 
the issues of the day. The kids' shows and science and history 
documentaries can't be beat. And National Public Radio is a true news 
organization, not just covering stories but uncovering them, large and 
small, all over the world.

<p>But when you look at the primetime schedules of many PBS stations 
across the country there's a lot of dead air. Like the World War II 
cargo ship in "Mister Roberts," the programs sail "from tedium to 
apathy and back again, with an occasional side trip to monotony." There 
are all too many nights and weeks of pledge drives filled with 
self-help lectures, doo-wop concerts and the Best of the Andy Williams 
Christmas specials.

<p>With that quest for money comes fear. Not only fear that there won't be 
enough, but the fear of offending the funder, whether it be the public, 
corporations, foundations or government; of saying or doing something 
that will prompt the hand that feeds to shut off the nourishment or 
meddle with and censor programming. That, in turn, leads to what may be 
the worst kind of censorship: self-censorship, a preemptive, 
self-inflicted blow to stave off the clenched fist of the funder.

<p>Over the last couple of years, we saw grievous attempts at government 
interference on the part of Ken Tomlinson, a conservative Bush 
appointee who, as a board member and chairman of the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting (CPB), which administers the Federal financing of 
public broadcasting, illegally paid for the monitoring of public 
broadcasting's alleged ideological content and attempted to influence 
programming.

<p>Now Tomlinson is gone, and not only from CPB. Just a couple of weeks 
ago he informed the president he was withdrawing his name for another 
term as chair of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), which 
oversees government-financed, international broadcast operations such 
as Voice of America and Radio Marti.

<p>As Variety reported January 10, "Last year, an inspector general's 
report by the State Dept. -- BBG's parent agency -- criticized 
Tomlinson for inappropriately putting a friend on the BBG payroll and 
for using BBG time and resources to conduct his private horse racing 
business and to bet on horses." With the new Democratic Congress, 
Senate confirmation of Tomlinson would have been tough sledding at best.

<p>He soon may be forgotten by most (although, fair warning, he's writing 
a book), but Tomlinson's legacy is far from gone. Last summer, to 
replace Tomlinson as a Corporation for Public Broadcasting board 
member, President Bush named conservative television executive Warren 
Bell, a sitcom producer who has frequently contributed material to the 
right-wing National Review's website. There he once wrote that he would 
"reach across the aisle and hug Nancy Pelosi... except this is a new 
shirt, and that sort of thing leaves a stain." (After his nomination to 
CPB, he apologized.)

<p>The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee rejected 
Bell's nomination, but after Congress adjourned in December, amidst the 
distraction of the holidays, President Bush placed Bell on the board 
anyway, using his power to make recess appointments when Congress isn't 
in session.

<p>(More on Bell specifically and recess appointments in general next 
week.)

<p>Perhaps the media watch group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) 
is right: maybe the $400 million public broadcasting receives from the 
government via CPB is too great a price to pay for the muzzling of 
vision, creativity and controversy.

<p>The current situation cries out for the creation of a long-dreamed-of 
trust fund for public broadcasting, free of partisan interference from 
either side. We should go to Congress and the American people for one 
big push: the pledge drive to, quite literally, end all pledge drives.

<p>Quixotic, perhaps, but watching those vibrant clips from the old "51st 
State" last week reminded me that we have strayed woefully far from the 
original vision of what public broadcasting was supposed to be. A 
national trust fund may be the only option left.
