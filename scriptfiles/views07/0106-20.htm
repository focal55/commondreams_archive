<p>The <i>New York Times</i> captured the headline - "Jubilant Democrats Assume 
Control on Capitol Hill." Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to become 
Speaker of the House, overshadowed her co-leader, Senator Harry Reid, 
the new majority leader of the Senate, though both of their speeches 
were remarkably similar.

<p>Now that the Democrats, after twelve long years, control the Congress, 
what are they going to do with it? Quite clearly, in their first 100 
hours in the House of Representatives, they want to increase the 
long-frozen minimum wage, give the federal government authority to 
negotiate price cuts with the drug companies for the medicines that 
Uncle Sam is the purchasing agent, reduce interest rates on student 
loans, roll back subsidies for oil and gas companies and void 
restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.

<p>All these are called reforms. But most are catch-ups or rollbacks of 
mostly corporate-lobbied policies that pushed our country back. Not 
exactly breaking new ground. But then, the Democrats chose them for 
their relative ease of passage. If, however, they are blocked by the 
Republicans, Democrats want to make them issues that could cost the GOP 
votes in the coming 2008 election.

<p>It is the 2008 election that looms over this new Congress. For the 
Democrats in office, with few exceptions, extreme caution is the mode. 
This means that all the outrages Democrats attributed to the Bush regime 
since 2001 - many of which could have been stopped by the large 
Democratic minority then in the Congress- are not on the agenda today.

<p>Early and troubling signals from Capitol Hill indicate that the 
Democrats are not going to move to remove the brazen Bush tax cuts for 
the wealthy, are not going to go after the huge waste and redundancy in 
military weapons contracts rendered obsolete with the demise of the 
Soviet Union, are not going to end massive corporate welfare, as we know 
it, and are not going to propose a serious crackdown on widespread 
corporate crime, fraud and abuse.

<p>Granted, the Democrats are making big noises about ethics reform, moving 
to ban a variety of corporate freebies from corporate jet travel to 
gifts and dinners. But the 800 pound gorilla is big business money in 
political campaigns. The gorilla seems not to worry. Fund-raising 
dinners are already starting up and the corporate greasers are 
readjusting their attentions to the receptive majority Democrats.

<p>Of all the reasons why the Democrats won in 2006, most of them agree 
that the foremost one was the public's expanding revulsion against Bush 
over the Iraq war-quagmire. To move to end that disaster for the United 
States, for Iraq and for our status in the world, the Democrats possess 
a number of assets.

<p>Public opinion is nearing 70 percent against Bush and the war. Bush's 
approval rating is in the low 30s. Only 17 percent of the public 
supports his increasing the number of soldiers in Iraq. The situation in 
Iraq is worsening by the month, including U.S. casualties and 
expenditures. Finally, dozens of ex-generals, admirals, top national 
security advisors, diplomats and a growing number of former high Bush 
Administration officials are pressing for various withdrawal strategies.

<p>What more does an opposition Party in control of the legislative branch 
need? Battlefield veteran, Cong. John Murtha has been out in front for 
over a year demanding an 'out of Iraq' policy. Later this month, about 
1000 active duty soldiers will petition their Congress to get out of 
this war. Demonstrations are increasing around the country.

<p>Still, Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid, themselves critical of Bush's 
criminal war, exude ambiguities and eschew a decisive alternative 
pathway to peace. It is as if they are on the sidelines watching 
Bush-Cheney self-destruct politically for the Republicans in 2008.

<p>If you are looking to test these early signs in the coming months, 
consider what kind of investigations the Senate and House Committees 
launch. Consider whether the few Democrats demanding an impeachment 
process for the accountability of Messrs. Bush and Cheney are silenced 
by their leaders.

<p>About two years ago, a poll showed 52 percent of Americans would favor 
impeachment if they learned the President was lying about the reasons 
for invading Iraq. That number is probably larger today, given all the 
disclosures that confirm the multiple lies, fabrications and cover-ups 
leading to and during the Iraq military occupation.

<p>Another litmus paper test is how closely these dominant Democrats work 
with progressive national citizen groups in Washington, D.C. When the 
Republicans took over in 1995, groups like the Heritage Foundation and 
American Enterprise Institute almost took up residence in the Senate and 
the House, feeding legislation, studies and strategies to the welcoming 
Republicans.
