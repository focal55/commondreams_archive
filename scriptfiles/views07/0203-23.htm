<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> She was only 
  seven years older, 
  which means that 
  when I moved here, 
  she was barely 
  40. The hard part, 
  now, is that we 
  won&#8217;t just 
  go on appearing, 
  sometimes side 
  by side, always 
  on the same side, 
  in <em>The Texas 
  Observer</em>.</p>

<p>
I used to go to the 
Final Fridays late, 
after the slam poets 
were done, after 
the party had quieted 
down some and mainly 
the bitter-enders 
were left, just so 
I could sit among 
the butts and bottles 
like a bad child 
and listen to the 
rowdy tales and feel 
part of our group&#8212;the 
hard-core liberals 
in Texas. And just 
so I could watch 
her flash that smile, 
and hear her call 
me sweetheart now 
and then.</p><p>
Molly was our magnet, 
our long memory and 
our cutting edge. 
She had a fine, sharp 
pen, but she was 
at her best, I think, 
at home, in company, 
spinning tales, honing 
her perfect comic 
pitch, that fine 
mix of the telling 
and tawdry that so 
captured the spirit 
of Texas.</p><p>
Of course she was 
never well-behaved 
in public either. 
And her tough, funny 
vulgarity did more 
than just cut through 
crap. It dispelled 
fear. It remade how 
you tell truth and 
confront power. It 
forged the bonds 
that are only made 
with an earthy laugh. 
In this way, for 
most who read her 
and everyone who 
heard her speak, 
she broke the spell 
of the Bush years. 
The face of liberalism 
became Molly&#8217;s 
face&#8212;and who 
could resist it?</p><p>
My father loved her 
(and she him). They 
were exactly in tune; 
he saw himself in 
her. Their purposes 
and their methods 
and in some ways 
their backgrounds 
and much of their 
humor were the same. 
He never came to 
Austin without saying, 
&#8220;Fix up lunch 
with Molly Ivins.&#8221; 
Our last good meeting 
came after he died; 
though she was quite 
weak, I spent several 
hours diverting her 
with stories of his 
last days. Once or 
twice I made a move 
to leave, but she 
didn&#8217;t want 
to stop.</p><p>
My new book is dedicated, 

&#8220;To Molly Ivins. 
Funnier than me.&#8221;</p>
