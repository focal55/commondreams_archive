 <p> The Army refilled five charges against 1st Lt. Ehren
Watada late last week, paving the way for a possible
second court-martial for the highest-ranking member of
the military to publicly refuse to deploy to Iraq.
When his first court-martial ended in a mistrial on
February 7th, serious debate on the emerging
opposition to the war within the military, the
legality of war, and the right of military personnel
to publicly disobey illegal orders had not yet begun
to surface. Though it's unclear that a second
court-martial may legally proceed, the possibility
brings these issues back into focus.  

<p>I was one of two journalists subpoenaed to testify in
Lt. Watada's court-martial. I objected on the grounds
that members of the military must be free to speak
with journalists without fear of retribution or
censure. That so few critical voices in the military
are given an ongoing platform in the media contributes
to an inaccurate view of the Iraq War and erroneous
ideas about how to ameliorate the problems. Supporting
the troops requires that we listen to what they have
to say. 

<p>Opposition is growing

<p>Army Specialist Mark Wilkerson was just sentenced to 7
months in prison for refusing to return to Iraq. Last
year, he wrote: In the year I was in Iraq, I saw kids
waving American flags in the first months. Then they
threw rocks. Then they planted IEDs. Then they blew
themselves up in city squares full of people. .
Hundreds of billions of American dollars, thousands of
American lives, and tens of thousands of Iraqi lives
have al been wasted in this war. I feel as though many
more soldiers want to say things like this, but are
afraid of retribution, and who's really listening
anyway. 

<p>Ivan Brobeck, a Marine who went to Canada rather than
return to Iraq, was released from prison on February
6th, just in time for the birth of his first child.
Army Medic Augustine Aguayo awaits a March 6th
court-martial in Germany and is facing up to 7 years
in prison. He's a conscientious objector who refused
to load his gun during the year he spent as a combat
medic in Iraq. Despite nearly three years attempted to
have his conscientious objector status approved,
Aguayo was ordered back to Iraq. When his commanding
officers threatened to send him to Iraq in shackles,
he climbed out his bedroom window and went AWOL into
Germany. According to the Pentagon, there are at least
8,000 soldiers who have quietly AWOL. Hundreds more
have gone to Canada.

<p>The Appeal for Redress has received over 1600 active
duty signatures. The online petition says, "As a
patriotic American proud to serve the nation in
uniform, I respectfully urge my political leaders in
Congress to support the prompt withdrawal of all
American military forces and bases from Iraq. Staying
in Iraq will not work and is not worth the price."
What began as a simple online petition has exploded
into public dissent: soldiers are attending anti-war demonstrations, holding press conferences. Liam Madden is one of the appeal's founders, and embarked on a cross-country speaking tour just two weeks after being released from the Marines. 

<p>Last year's Zogby poll showed that 72% of soldiers
wanted to leave Iraq by the end of 2006. Opinion has
not grown more sanguine. Though soldiers have stinging criticisms of the Iraq War we rarely get to hear them. Instead, Lt. Watada is relentlessly juxtaposed with soldiers who have no apparent qualms about their orders. 

<p>Speaking against the war

<p>When Lt. Watada announced his opposition to the Iraq
War on June 7, 2006, many called him a coward. He took
an oath, they argued, and must obey orders regardless
of the war's legality. Even those sympathetic to Lt.
Watada's beliefs sometimes appear uneasy with his
public opposition to the Iraq War, especially when
speaking to members of the press. 

<p>Whether members of the military should abandon
individual responsibility when they go to war is a
debate worth having. While members of the military
agree to certain speech restrictions, the extent of
those limitations is by no means immutable. In fact,
it is one of several questions in Lt. Watada's
prosecution.

<p>Members of the military agree not to speak
contemptuously about the commander-in-chief. Lt.
Watada expressed himself respectfully, out of uniform,
off base, and after work hours. It seems that the
specter of military law is so dark and mysterious a
force that ordinary civilians have ceded their ability
to question the authority of those that wield it. 

<p>Why is our civilian society so comfortable allowing
the military to determine the parameters of acceptable
speech during a time of war? Lt. Watada - along with
the thousands of men and women who are returning from
Iraq today - is uniquely positioned to speak about the
military mission in Iraq. What do we lose when we
allow the systematic exclusion of their voices? 

<p>The Iraq War is messy. It's inconvenient. The absence
of soldiers denouncing the war in mainstream
consciousness likely has something to do with the
public's unwillingness to face the war itself. What
does it mean if this war is actually illegal? In what
ways is each of us complicit in the perpetration of a
war not thoroughly vetted by the media, debated by
congress, nor considered by the public? The starkness
of these answers is reflected in the faces of the men
and women returning from battle. But if we don't hear
from Ivan Brobeck, Mark Wilkerson, Augustine Aguayo
and any of the hundreds of Iraq veterans return to the
United States isolated and disillusioned, it's easier
to believe that everything is going just fine.
