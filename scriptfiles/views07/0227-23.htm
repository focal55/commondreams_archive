<p>A billion dollars will be spent on this race. By whom? The bigs. Why will they cough up the money? Because of a burning desire for good government?The race for president is in full swing, but feel no need to get excited, contribute to a candidate or watch the debates. Selecting the &quot;American Idol&quot; will be a more democratic process than nominating the Republican and Democratic candidates for president.<p>You, my friends, are not needed. Big media conglomerates, pollsters, consultants, big drug and insurance companies, and other captains of industry will take this burden from your shoulders. You have plenty to keep you busy just making a living, so you can let the big boys (&quot;bigs&quot;) and their bagmen make the decision for you. Rather comforting, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p><p>The bigs want a close race between the Democrat and the Republican, so that both must beg them for big bucks in their Faustian bargain.</p><p>The Democratic Leadership Council bigs decided five years ago to nominate Hillary Clinton in 2008. Sure, Barack Obama is a rising star with charisma Hillary would kill for, but he won&#39;t get the big money he needs. You say, &quot;But people like him.&quot; So what? Too unpredictable. The bigs don&#39;t know enough about him. You will be told, &quot;not enough experience.&quot; Translated, that means &quot;he might have his own agenda.&quot;</p><p>He might pursue peace in the Middle East while pushing for universal single-payer health care or proposing that the bigs pay Social Security taxes on all income coupled with a progressive tax system. Yikes! Better stick with Hillary. The bigs know her game, and she plays well. Remember NAFTA?</p><p>John Edwards? Hell no. He is way too serious about poverty, and that could bring more money and smaller classes to public schools but less for the military-industrial complex. What if Edwards pushes through a living wage, health care, fewer prisons, and decent housing? One can almost hear the bigs yelling, &quot;What about us?&quot; Iraq? Bring &#39;em home. Iran? Leave it to the U.N. Besides, Edwards thinks corporations should be responsible for their misdeeds. What is he a commie?</p><p>Tom Vilsack? Too late. He dropped out because of money. Shame on him. Why didn&#39;t he select wealthy parents or join the DLC, or both? I must admit, he is a quick study. Lack of money stopped two other Iowans who should have been president, John Culver and Tom Harkin. Vilsack had the quaint notion that a person with executive experience, good values and good ideas could run for president and let the people decide. I&#39;m not kidding; he thought this was a democracy.</p><p>His Field of Dreams campaign build it and the money will come collapsed before he could locate the cornfield. Vilsack was told that he needed &#036;20 million by June of this year to be taken seriously. Face it, Tom. The bigs don&#39;t like you very much. I like Vilsack.</p><p>How about Bill Richardson? He is a popular governor, a former ambassador to the U.N., a seven-term member of Congress, and former secretary of energy! The man is smart, experienced, gutsy, and knows about energy needs. He was elected governor with 69 percent of the vote; he has negotiated on the international scene. He, like Vilsack, is a good man with executive experience, solid values and plenty of good ideas. Bye-bye, Bill. Bye-bye. He might make it until Easter.</p><p>Al Gore? Way too independent, and this global warming stuff please! Good for Hollywood but not for our economy. He is needlessly scaring folks into finding alternatives to our comfortable way of life. Indeed, his truth is inconvenient for the bigs. The utilities don&#39;t like him, the oil boys can&#39;t stand him, and the auto industry is more than a little suspicious. Hell, he even opposed the invasion of Iraq! The bigs don&#39;t like any of it. &quot;Thanks anyway, Al. Good movie.&quot;</p><p>Now then, how about Joe Biden? I don&#39;t think so. So long, Joe.</p><p>Take a break, folks. They will let you know the names of the chosen ones by July.</p><p>But wait. I didn&#39;t write anything about the Republican race. Could it be that Tommy has the nomination in the bag? He says he will shake every hand in Iowa good start. He is not burdened with ideology or new ideas. He is clear about Iraq. He said the other day that they could have a civil war if they aren&#39;t careful.</p><p></tbull /></tinit />Back to reality. A billion dollars will be spent on this race. By whom? The bigs. Why will they cough up the money? Because of a burning desire for good government?</p><p>Remember when we had a democracy and people like us played a role in nominating our candidates? Whom do you favor for &quot;American Idol&quot;?</p><p>Our democracy has been hijacked. Might as well watch TV.</p>
