<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Speaking with a journalist friend over the weekend, just back from his sixth 
or seventh trip to Iraq, my mind flashed to a moment in James Goldman's play 
and movie "The Lion in Winter."

<p>The English King Henry II's sons and wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, are scheming 
against the monarch and plotting against each other. One of the boys, Prince 
John (whose perfidy as king three decades later will lead to the Magna Carta) 
is accosted by his brother Richard (as in "the Lionhearted"). "He's got a 
knife!" John shouts.

<p>"Of course he has a knife," Eleanor replies. "He always has a knife. We all 
have knives. It's 1183 and we're barbarians!"

<p>Nearly eight and a half centuries later, we're still barbarians, and I'm not 
just talking about the rabid Islamic extremists who make life miserable for 
the rest of us, including their fellow Muslims.

<p>Okay, there are some good signs. My friend told me about being in a US 
military hospital when a badly wounded Sunni insurgent was brought in, a guy who had 
been shot while planting a roadside bomb. Thirty units of blood were given 
him but he still was fading fast. A call for donors went out and within minutes 
there was a line of GI's ready to give. A life's a life, they said.

<p>On the other hand, my friend and colleague said he has never seen as much 
gore and carnage as he did on this trip. The situation continues to deteriorate 
and Afghanistan is rapidly going down the tubes, too, says he. That, in turn, 
is critically threatening the stability of Pakistan. And so on and so on and so 
on...

<p>Our own barbarism manifests itself in our continuing ignorance of the Middle 
East, despite our many years bogged down there. Nowhere is that lack of 
knowledge more manifest than in our seeming, even willful inability to make sense of 
the intramural fighting within the Islamic religion that's so key to 
understanding what's going on there.

<p>The split between Sunni and Shiite Muslims dates back four hundred years 
before Eleanor of Aquitaine was verbally going medieval on her offspring, and has 
to do with the line of succession from the prophet Mohammed. Over the 
centuries, some of the differences have blurred and often there have been 
intermarriage and good feelings. But our recent actions have stirred the pot beyond our 
powers of comprehension.

<p>Reporting in Monday's Washington Post, Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Shadid, 
author of a superb book about Iraq ("Night Draws Near"), wrote, "The growing 
Sunni-Shiite divide is roiling an Arab world as unsettled as at any time in a 
generation. Fought in speeches, newspaper columns, rumors swirling through 
cafes and the Internet, and occasional bursts of strife, the conflict is 
predominantly shaped by politics: a disintegrating Iraq, an ascendant Iran, a sense of 
Arab powerlessness and a persistent suspicion of American intentions. But the 
division has begun to seep into the region's social fabric, too. The sectarian 
fault line has long existed and sometimes ruptured, but never, perhaps, has 
it been revealed in such a stark, disruptive fashion.

<p>"... Rarely has the region witnessed so many events, in so brief a time, that 
have been so widely interpreted through a sectarian lens: the empowering of 
Iraq's Shiite-led government and the bloodletting that has devastated the 
country; the lack of support by America's Sunni Arab allies -- Egypt, Jordan and 
Saudi Arabia -- for the Shiite movement Hezbollah in its fight with Israel last 
summer; and, most decisively, the perception among many Sunni Arabs that 
Saddam Hussein was lynched by Shiites bent on revenge. In the background is the 
growing assertiveness of Shiite Iran as the influence of other traditional 
regional powers such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia diminishes."

<p>That last sentence is especially relevant amidst our current saber rattling 
toward Iran and this past Sunday's bizarre press conference in Baghdad's Green 
Zone. Bizarre because reporters' cellphones were seized, no one was allowed to 
shoot photos or video and the briefers insisted on anonymity.

<p>Our military presented alleged evidence of Iran's ties to Shiite militias in 
Iraq -- in the form of rocket-propelled grenades (RPG's), mortar shells and 
especially vicious devices that tear through armor called EFP's -- explosively 
formed penetrators. All are said to be of Iranian manufacture, purportedly 
brought into Iraq by the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

<p>(I'm just wondering, by the way, not judging: According to the New York 
Times, "The shells had serial numbers in English in order to comply with 
international standards for arms, the officials said. One grenade, for instance, was 
marked with the serial number P.G.7-AT-1 followed by LOT:5-31-2006." Numbering 
month-day-year is an American standard. Virtually every other country, including 
English-speaking ones, uses day-month-year: 31-05-2006. I asked two, Mideast 
native speakers if the day-month-year standard was also true in Iran's Farsi 
language and Arabic. They answered yes.)

<p>It would be foolhardy to dismiss the reports totally out-of-hand, just 
because this administration's truth-telling track record rivals Baron Munchausen's. 
We've all heard the story of the little-boy-who-cried-Wolf-Blitzer.

<p>Nevertheless, as Tuesday's New York Times reported, "Both Democratic and 
Republican officials on Capitol Hill said that while they do not doubt that the 
weapons are being used to attack American troops, and that some of those weapons 
are being shipped into Iraq from Iran, they are still uncertain whether the 
weapons were being shipped into Iraq on the orders of Iran's leaders."

<p>George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace added, 
"I'm not doubting the provenance of the weapons, but rather, the issue of what it 
says about Iranian policy and whether Iran's leaders are aware of it."

<p>As has been suggested, this administration may just be trying to scapegoat 
Iran for America's failures in Iraq. But if they are hell-bent on using these 
allegations as part of a pretext for military action against Iran and, not 
coincidentally, its nuclear program, they would do well not only to remember the 
gross errors of far too recent memory ("slam-dunk," anyone?) but the 
socio-cultural implications of what Iran may or may not be up to. They could be trying to 
create regional havoc and increase their status as a regional superpower, but 
their motivations are also about protecting the religious interests of Shiite 
Muslims.
<p>Until we comprehend that, we should move with the most extreme caution or not 
at all.

<p>The consequences of a misstep are perilous, and yet our foolish barbarians 
blunder on. Conservative cold warrior Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor-at-large for 
UPI and the right-wing Washington Times, reported the following (as noted by 
Dan Froomkin's "White House Watch" column on the Washington Post website):

<p>"At a farewell reception at Blair House for the retiring chief of protocol, 
Don Ensenat, who was President Bush's Yale roommate, the president shook hands 
with Washington Life Magazine's Soroush Shehabi. 'I'm the grandson of one of 
the late Shah's ministers,' said Soroush, 'and I simply want to say one US bomb 
on Iran and the regime we all despise will remain in power for another 20 or 
30 years and 70 million Iranians will become radicalized.'

<p>"'I know,' President Bush answered.

<p>"'But does Vice President Cheney know?'' asked Soroush.

<p>"President Bush chuckled and walked away."
