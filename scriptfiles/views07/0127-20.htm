<p>What truth moves behind, beneath our gathering "No"? 
Our no to escalation, no to Mr. Bush's denial and
duplicity?  The surge of "YES!"
  
<p>This yes speaks to our shared humanity, cries yes to
an evolution, a revolution, a transformation of our
vision beyond the illusion of our separateness, beyond
the inherent lie in the numbing repetition of the
label "enemy" - beyond war.
  
<p>The work of Marshall Rosenberg, a language called Non
Violent Communication (NVC), is premised upon the
understanding that the needs of the individual are
linked to the needs of the collective, and points to
the view that needs are, in fact, universal, shared by
the human family. NVC teaches that behind each "no"
lives a "yes" to meeting another need, more central,
more "alive" in the moment. 

<p>What is alive, most alive in this moment of planet
time is the reality, the pre-eminent actuality of the
crisis of human-caused climate change and its
attendant rippling effects upon security, species
diversity and survival.  Rumbling beneath our no to
escalation of the criminal obscenity that is the
US-created catastrophe in Iraq, is a yes that can be
heard erupting around the world, from each one of us
at once. Together we are recognizing, through floods, hurricanes and record temperatures, that something is "up" and upside down, and we are waking up.
  
<p>Our yes affirms a world model that invites dialogue
and co-operation, that rallies our combined energies
toward the global challenge, commonly held.  When we
say yes, we recognize the tragedy and failure and
waste of war. Our yes is to taking off the blinders
and acknowledging that war gobbles wantonly at our
shared resources, poisons our planet home, and spends,
expends, our treasure - the intelligence, will,
creativity and life blood of young American men and
women and of all those they are consigned to kill and
destroy "on the other side of the world."  (W -
January 10, 2007.) 
 
<p>"Yes" attests to our readiness to surrender the
tortuous delusion that has brought us to this
precipice. As Albert Einstein expressed, it is "our
experience of ourselves . as something separate from
the rest [that is] - a kind of optical illusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening the circle of understanding and compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
  
<p>As we take to the streets in Washington DC, across the
country and around the world this weekend, we intone
yes to a world where we recognize our every effort as
an attempt to meet our needs, and each his or her
needs. We sing yes to our commitment to awaken to the
essential nature of our humanity, to see ourselves in
each other and to live our lives as members of the
human family, and of the earth community. The chorus
is growing. Yes to one world, where the needs of the
many are met.
