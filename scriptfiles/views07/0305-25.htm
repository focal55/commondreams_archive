<p>The American psyche, as it were, and its perpetual wars and honeymoons 
with various peoples of the world, remind me of the cases of domestic 
violence I see in my work as a psychotherapist. Current understanding of 
domestic violence underscores the centrality of the perpetrator's need 
for power and control, with a familiar pattern of a tension building 
phase, an outbreak of violence, followed by a period of remorse or 
honeymoon, to be repeated again and again.

<p>In the lead up to the Iraq attack, many in America came to feel that 
Iraq was an enemy, an imminent threat, and war a justifiable response to 
Saddam's provocations. Now that the violent urge vis a vis Iraq has been 
spent, we hear of concern for the hapless Iraqis, that the U.S. will 
allow in more Iraqi refugees, and it's hard to find Americans feeling 
visceral enmity towards Iraqis. A well-known standup comedian said 
before the war, "soon my friend Scott's going to date only Iraqi girls," 
referring to the shifting lines of love and hate seen in the wake of 
past conflicts. The same pattern can be observed in previous wars, hot 
and cold, overt and covert - Japan, Vietnam, the Native Americans - to 
name a few from a shockingly long list of former enemies.

<p>Predictably, we are once again being swept up in the tension-building 
phase, this time against Iran. Even the timid discussions of why a 
military attack against Iran is not a good idea, take for granted that 
Iran is an enemy and a dangerous threat that needs to be brought in 
line. Rarely, if ever, do such discussions include any sense of 
compassion or horror for what an attack would do to the actual flesh and 
blood human beings under the bombs. At best, their suffering remains a 
philosophical abstraction about other people's lives, at worst, an 
alluring target for racist and islamophobic rage.

<p>Of course, conflict and disagreements are a part of any relationship, as 
are making up and compromising. It is when actual or threatened violence 
and the need for absolute power and control are involved in these 
conflicts that a relationship is deemed dysfunctional and dangerous. 
America is by no means the only perpetrator of violence in the world, 
and of course Iran is no so-called angel. As in some domestic violence 
cases, the battered partner can also resort to physical violence or 
verbal attacks, but the key difference is that the violence the more 
powerful party can mete out is on such a greater and more dangerous 
scale that it aptly receives the bulk of the attention from intervening 
parties.

<p>American military prowess can easily destroy Iran, a land with an 
irreplaceable 5000-year history. Iran can goad and irritate America and 
may even leave a scratch mark here or there, but the power difference is 
undeniable. Most tragically, caught in the middle are the innocent lives 
of ordinary Iranians and young American GIs, like the children who get 
hurt when caught in the middle of fights between parents.

<p>In domestic violence cases, the only demonstrated way to see an end to 
the pattern of violence is when the perpetrator understands and 
internalizes that physical aggression is unacceptable, no matter what. 
So long as America accepts violence as a legitimate means of resolving 
conflicts, this pattern will continue. Every American who feels a 
visceral threat from Iran these days, owing in no small part to a 
mainstream media which is ever ready to demonize the "other," must come 
to see that Iran also has certain rights, including the right to exist 
without the constant threat of force and that if there is a 
disagreement, it can not be resolved through violence. As any domestic 
violence victim can attest, when the tension builds up high enough, it 
no longer matters how careful and compliant she is. Inevitably, he will 
find a reason and strike out. America is again on the verge of making 
victims of yet another population of the world. This urge to strike out 
at perceived enemies must be owned and diffused peacefully. On this 
planet, there are no national divorces. We are stuck together, when we 
like each other and when we don't. It is precisely at such a time that 
we must focus on all that we have in common, shifting our gaze to 
others' humanity and our own flaws.
