When Vermont Governor Jim Douglas, a Republican with reasonably close
ties to President Bush, asked if there was any additional business to
be considered at the town meeting he was running in Middlebury, Ellen
McKay popped up and proposed the impeachment of Bush and Vice President
Dick Cheney.
<p>The governor was not amused. As moderator of the annual meeting, he
tried to suggest that the proposal to impeach -- along with another
proposal to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq -- could not be voted on.
</p>
<p>But McKay, a program coordinator at Middlebury College, pressed her
case. And it soon became evident that the crowd at the annual meeting
shared her desire to hold the president to account.
</p>
<p>

So Douglas backed down.

     
</p><p>"It became clear that no one was going home until they had the
chance to discuss the resolutions and vote on them," explained David
Rosenberg, a political science professor at Middlebury College. "And
being a good politician, he allowed the vote to happen."
</p>
<p>
By an overwhelming voice vote, Middlebury called for impeachment.
</p>
<p>
So it has gone this week at town meetings across Vermont, most of which were held Tuesday.
</p>
<p>Late Tuesday night, there were confirmed reports that 36 towns had
backed impeachment resolutions, and the number was expected to rise.
</p>
<p>
In one town, Putney, the vote for impeachment was unanimous.
</p>
<p>In addition to Governor Douglas's Middlebury, the town of Hartland,
which is home to Congressman Peter Welch, backed impeachment. So, too,
did Jericho, the home of Gaye Symington, the speaker of the Vermont
House of Representatives.
</p>
<p>Organizers of the grassroots drive to get town meetings to back
impeachment resolutions hope that the overwhelming support the
initiative has received will convince Welch to introduce articles of
impeachment against Bush and Cheney. That's something the Democratic
congressman is resisting, even though his predecessor, Bernie Sanders,
signed on last year to a proposal by Michigan Congressman John Conyers
to set up a House committee to look into impeachment.

</p>
<p>Vermont activists also want their legislature to approve articles of
impeachment and forward them to Congress. But Symington, also a
Democrat, has discouraged the initiative, despite the fact that more
than 20 representatives have cosponsored an impeachment resolution.
</p>
<p>"It's going to be hard for Peter Welch and Gaye Symington to say
there's no sentiment for impeachment, now that their own towns have
voted for it," says Dan DeWalt, a Newfane, Vermont, town selectman who
started the impeachment initiative last year in his town, and who now
plans to launch a campaign to pressure Welch and Symington to respect
and reflect the will of the people.
</p>
<p>It is going to be even harder for Governor Douglas, who just this
month spent two nights at the Bush White House, to face his president.
</p>
<p>After all, Douglas now lives in a town that is on record in support
of Bush's impeachment and trial for high crimes and misdemeanors.
</p>
<p>
For the record, Middlebury says:
</p>
<p>
<i>We the people have the power -- and the responsibility -- to remove
executives who transgress not just the law, but the rule of law.
</i></p>
<p>
<i>The oaths that the President and Vice President take binds them to
"preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."
The failure to do so forms a sound basis for articles of impeachment.

</i></p>
<p>
<i>The President and Vice President have failed to "preserve, protect and
defend the Constitution" in the following ways:
</i></p>
<p>
<i>1. They have manipulated intelligence and misled the country to
justify an immoral, unjust, and unnecessary preemptive war in Iraq.
</i></p>
<p>
<i>2.  They have directed the government to engage in domestic spying
without warrants, in direct contravention of U.S. law.
</i></p>
<p>
<i>3.  They have conspired to commit the torture of prisoners, in violation of the Federal Torture Act and the Geneva Convention.
</i></p>
<p>
<i>4.  They have ordered the indefinite detention without legal counsel,
without charges and without the opportunity to appear before a civil
judicial officer to challenge the detention -- all in violation of U.S. law and the Bill of Rights.
</i></p>
<p>

<i>When strong evidence exists of the most serious crimes, we must use
impeachment -- or lose the ability of the legislative branch to compel
the executive branch to obey the law.
</i></p>
<p>
<i>George Bush has led our country to a constitutional crisis, and it is
our responsibility to remove him from office.</i>
</p>

Royalism</a>.
Rolling Stone's Tim Dickinson hails it as a "nervy, acerbic,
passionately argued history-cum-polemic [that] combines a rich
examination of the parliamentary roots and past use of
the 'heroic medicine' that is impeachment with a call for Democratic
leaders to 'reclaim and reuse the most vital tool handed to us by the
founders for the defense of our most basic liberties.'"</em></p>
