<p>The bungling of Saddam's trial and execution hurts America's reputation.

<p>Just when it seemed the Bush-Cheney Administration couldn't drag America's reputation any lower, it did.

<p>The U.S. is now being rebuked around the globe for delivering President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to a Shiite lynch mob.

<p>Washington professed surprise and denied blame for this disgusting, gruesome atrocity. But Saddam had been under U.S. guard in a U.S.-run prison in the U.S.-run Green Zone. What did U.S. officials think the mob of U.S.-backed Shiite thugs intended to do with Saddam? Give him a parade?

<p>The United States has already been heavily criticized for stage-managing the kangaroo court that condemned Saddam. He was hurriedly executed to prevent him from revealing embarrassing details about the involvement in Saddam's crimes of the U.S., Britain, and Arab oil monarchs.

<p>Ironically, Saddam's courage and dignity on the gallows will reinforce his claim to martyrdom and make him the hero in death that he was not in life.

<p>By contrast, the UN's new South Korean secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who was shoe-horned into office by Washington, shamefully supported Saddam's execution even though the UN has long opposed the death penalty. An inauspicious start for a timid yes-man.

<p>Following this latest violation of international law and basic civilized behaviour, the Bush-Cheney administration is widely expected to announce plans to deploy another 20,000 troops to Iraq. This will be George Bush's petulant reply to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group's wise proposal that all U.S. combat forces withdraw from Iraq within a year.

<p>Senior American generals charged with Iraq, including Gen. John Abazaid and Gen. George Casey, have openly disagreed with Bush's plans for a "surge" in U.S. troop deployment. These able officers told the media they didn't need more troops. They warned additional U.S. troops would deter Iraq's Shia regime from developing its own security forces and keep it dependant on the U.S.

<p>These statements were a shocker. Generals are not supposed to publicly disagree with their commander-in-chief. Gen. Casey is expected to be fired soon and replaced by a yes man. Gen. Abazaid is retiring early, in disgust, say friends.

<p>Casey and Abazaid follow another fine, courageous officer, former Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki, who choose duty to America over career. He was forced to retire by the White House after publicly stating a minimum of 300,000 U.S. troops would be needed to pacify Iraq. The 140,000 U.S. troops currently in Iraq are stretched to the breaking point and hard pressed to defend their own bases and vulnerable supply lines.

<p>Many U.S. senior military officers privately say it is small wonder Bush, who styles himself the "war president," is so deficient in military experience and knowledge. A few months in the Texas Air National Guard evading wartime draft certainly did not prepare him to wage two wars.

<p>Good, responsible presidents know when to listen to their generals, and when to retreat from stalemated or lost wars. If Bush does send thousands more troops to Iraq, he will be risking more American lives in a desperate, 11th-hour political gamble to show voters he has a new plan to resolve the horrible mess in Iraq he created.

<p>Twenty or thirty thousand more U.S. troops thrown into the cauldron of Iraq will make little military difference. One hundred fifty thousand or more might, but the U.S. has run out of soldiers.

<p>If Bush pours more troops into this -- a lost war -- he will fall into the trap of many bad gamblers who double up their bets in a reckless effort to recoup previous losses.

<p>Bush continues ignoring his generals while still heeding the siren song of the neo-cons around him. Their goal is not advancing America's interests, but totally destroying Iraq, then Iran.

<p>Sen. John McCain, the current Republican presidential front-runner, has joined Bush and Cheney in urging more troops be sent to Iraq. All three have clearly lost touch with reality and their nation's basic values.

<p>Call it Saddam's curse.
