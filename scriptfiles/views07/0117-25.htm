The <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/15/hanging.reax.reut/" target="_new">
botched executions</a> in Baghdad have revived public discussion of the
sordid "science" of killing people in a "humane" manner. Saddam Hussein
was taunted by his executioners as they pulled the trap door on him.
This past weekend, when Saddam's half-brother and former secret police
chief met the same fate, the hangman's noose tore his head off.
<p>
Oh, well, he IS dead. Wasn't that the point?
</p>
<p>
Civilization has progressed on this delicate question over many
centuries and none has been more conscientious than America. The US
government does now and then declare a public need to kill people, but
is always mindful to do so in ways that avoid unnecessary pain and
suffering. The victims are presumed to be grateful for this but,
unfortunately, not around to express their views.
</p>
<p>
The Catholic Church, remember, used to burn heretics at the stake in
the Middle Ages--a spectacle of suffering that instructed the populace
on the importance of adhering to the true faith. The French guillotine
was regarded as a technological improvement--swift and surgically
certain. American industrial prowess took up the challenge and advanced
further with the electric chair and gas chamber. These methods also
proved imperfect. The electric chair sometimes fried the person before
it killed him. Enlightened jurisdictions adopted an <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/12/18/diaz.execution.ap/" target="_new">ostensibly
nonviolent technique</a>, fatal injections.

     
<p>

Now our "allies" in Iraq have dragged Americans back to consider the
rude calculations involved in hanging. John Burns, the <i>New York
Times</i> correspondent who sometimes injects droll British
understatement in his brilliant dispatches, <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html?emc=eta1" target="_new">reported</a> that the death of Barzan
Ibrahim al-Tikriti "appeared to have gone seriously awry." Indeed, he
lost his head--a vicious practice we abhor when Muslim fanatics employ
it.
</p>
<p>
With the thoroughness one expects from the <i>Times</i>, Burns went on
to explain the long-established tradition for calculating the "drop"
weight of the hangee's body with the proper length of rope needed to
snap the person's neck without also separating his head from his body.
As Iraq develops into a more advanced democracy, it will perhaps
improve on this.
</p>
<p>
All of this puts me in mind of Woody Allen's famous distinction on the
business of death. "I'm not afraid of dying--I just don't want to be
there when it happens."
</p>
<p>

Exactly. That is the American position. It is the preciousness of
America's niceties that mocks our moral posturing. As a nation, we kill
people--lots of them--both in war and on the home front. But, mind you,
only for good reasons. And always with surgical precision. We have
assembled massive killing power and will use it, but always with
sincere respect for those made dead.
</p>
<p>
Our advanced technologies allow us to sanitize this process--keep it
distant and avert our eyes from what's really happening. "Shock and
awe" bombing is our high-altitude tool for teaching others to respect
American power. Dead civilians, including dead babies, accumulate
as the regrettable "collateral damage" not to be confused with our
noble good intentions. The other side--lacking our advanced
sensibilities--simply kills people, butchers them in old-fashioned ways
that we find shocking.  
</p>
<p>
America has a twisted thing about "death." The mass culture plays
endlessly with death as if it were a popular video game (actually,
death is a wildly popular video game). Yet we are strangely squeamish.
Don't let the children see the blood. Don't slaughter in disrespectful
ways. Above all, don't show us the bodies afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Our nation would be healthier, I think, if we put aside the moral
pretensions and looked straight at the reality. Let's see the death and
dying--all of it--both at home and in war. The dead convicts, the dead
Iraqis and--yes--the dead Americans who went off to liberate those
people from their backwardness. We are tough people. We could take it,
couldn't we?
</p>
<p>
Years ago, I saw a celebrated newspaper photograph from the
<i>Louisville Courier Journal</i>. It was taken in 1938 and recorded
the last public hanging in Kentucky, held in a small country town.
People in those days used to gather in the courthouse square and watch.
The photographer (his name alas forgotten) did something brilliant. At
the final moment, as the trap door opened and the body fell, he wheeled
around with the camera and shot a picture of the spectators, men and
boys. Their faces were twisted in shock, slack-jawed and
contorted--made horrible themselves by the knowledge of what they saw.
