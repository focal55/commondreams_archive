Just as voters ran ahead of Congress with their November 
ballot against the president's war in Iraq, the people stormed past the media 
and the White House on Wednesday in convicting I. Lewis Libby Jr. as a lying 
puppet for those who gave him voice.<BR><BR>    The jury made history by delivering its four-count guilty verdict against 
the first chief of staff for a U.S. vice president ever to face trial. <BR><BR>    Libby obstructed justice by lying to federal officials probing the news 
leak that revealed Valerie Plame as a CIA agent. Along the way, the prosecutor 
got one reporter jailed for 85 days and forced several others to spend what 
must have seemed just as long testifying on the stand. <BR><BR>    The cozy relationship of elite Beltway reporters with their government 
sources got exposed at trial for the conflict of interest it too often is. 
These media gentry, some of whom earn millions in TV and book deals, seem more 
loyal to their sources than to the truth and the public's need to know.  <BR><BR>    Former New York Times reporter Judith Miller likely doesn't earn millions, 
but worked big-time with the warmongers, inside and outside of the Bush 
administration, in making the false case for the Iraq war.<BR><BR>    Ironically, and, some say, justifiably, this same Judith Miller, after 
refusing to reveal Libby as a source for a tip she did not print, served more 
time in jail than Libby might ever experience for his conviction. <BR><BR>    One needs look no further than the next-day editorial in The Washington 
Post to see that the Beltway media were not happy with Special Prosecutor 
Patrick J. Fitzgerald, or Plame's husband, Joseph C. Wilson, who fueled the 
court case. The Post wrote that Fitzgerald's pursuit of the "Washington scandal
 remarkable for its lack of substance," was executed under a "prescription for 
excess."<BR><BR>    Fitzgerald did indeed pursue Libby's cover-up instead of the crime it 
cloaked. The bypassed misdeed this time was not a two-bit burglary, but a part 
of the foundation of the Iraq war. <BR><BR>    The convicted chief of staff was "the fall guy" for his superiors who 
launched the war, according to Denis Collins, who spoke for the jury. "It was 
said a number of times: What are we doing with this guy here? Where's  Rove, 
where are these other guys?" Where indeed?<BR><BR>    The jurors dutifully deliberated with the case they had and not the case 
they might have wanted. Said Collins, "This was not a question of 'Who can we 
punish for going to Iraq?'"<BR><BR>    Among the 11-member jury were a retired math teacher, a government lawyer, 
a former journalist, a Web architect, a retired postal worker, and, for good 
measure, an investment banker with a PhD in economics from Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. <BR><BR>    The scene the press paints of their 10-day deliberation was a clinic on 
sifting evidence and testimony in search of a verdict. "The arithmetic of it 
became obvious," said Collins who, verdict aside, seemed sympathetic to Libby. <BR><BR>    Despite the troubling poleaxing of the press in this affair, the Libby 
trial provided a window into the mind-set of the White House that brazenly 
marched the nation off to war against the grain of incoming intelligence. The 
narrow beam of the "obstruction" case, however, prevented much of the material 
damaging to the White House war policy from entering the record. <BR><BR>    As Libby prepares his appeal, the White House is likely preparing his 
pardon as a contingency. As with the 2000 presidential vote, and the troop 
escalation following the November vote, President George W. Bush will spit on 
the will of the people. <BR><BR>    The conviction of Cheney's chief of staff will not likely move the cowardly
 vice president to do what's best for the country: Resign and move back to 
Wyoming with his foot up on a pillow.<BR><BR>    Thus it is perhaps time for the legislative and judicial branches of 
government to reclaim the republic with the constitutional mechanism provided 
by the Founding Fathers.<p align="center">Copyright 2007 Newsday Inc.</p><p align="center">###</p>
