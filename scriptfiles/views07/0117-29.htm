<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> It was Will Rogers who advised: "When you find yourself in a hole, stop 
digging." Yet the Bush administration is grabbing for every shovel it can find. 
Faced with his own spectacular failure in Iraq, with violence that his own CIA 
director termed "satanic, President Bush has chosen to escalate the very policy 
that catalyzed the slaughter and mayhem in the first place. The White House 
finds itself in a hole and, incomprehensibly, has decided to keep digging.
<P>It's long past time that we climb out of the hole. Today in the House of 
Representatives, I am introducing the Bring Our Troops Home and Sovereignty of 
Iraq Restoration Act, a comprehensive legislative proposal to quickly end the 
occupation of Iraq. It is a broad measure, capturing ideas from military and 
diplomatic experts and including provisions offered in previous legislative 
proposals. Specifically, the bill would, among other things:
<ul>
<li>Withdraw all U.S. troops and military contractors from Iraq within six 
months from the date of enactment.<br>
</li>
<li>Accelerate, during the six-month transition, training of a permanent 
Iraqi police force.<br>
</li>
<li>Prohibit the continued funding, except for the redeployment of troops 
currently in Iraq, of combat troops to Iraq.<br>
</li>
<li>Prohibit any permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq. (Despite official 
denials, bases are under construction, including one that includes a miniature 
golf course and a Pizza Hut).<br>
</li>
<li>Authorize, if requested by the Iraqi government, U.S. support for an 
international stabilization force, which would stay no longer than two years.<br>
</li>
<li>Prohibit U.S. participation in any long-term Iraqi oil production 
sharing agreements before the enactment by the Iraqi government of new 
regulations governing the industry.<br>
</li>
<li>Authorize an array of non-military assistance in Iraq, including 
reconstruction of a public-health system; destruction of land mines, recovery 
of ancient relics; and distribution of compensatory damages for civilian 
casualties.<br>
</li>
<li>Honor the sacrifice of our servicemen and women by providing full 
funding for every health-care treatment, and benefit that they are entitled to 
under current law.</li>
</ul>
<P>To be sure, peace and freedom will not bust out spontaneously the moment 
the last American soldier leaves Iraqi soil. Professor William Polk, co-author 
with former U.S. Sen. George McGovern of "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1416534563?tag=commondreams-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1416534563&adid=07AFHN60JMWWC0SW53NV&" target="_new">Out of Iraq: A Practical Plan for 
Withdrawal Now</a></i>" (Simon & Schuster, 2006), notes that such an assumption would 
be as naïve as the neoconservative pre-war fantasy that our soldiers would be 
met by bouquet-tossing Iraqis weeping with gratitude. But U.S. withdrawal, in 
addition to removing our own soldiers from harm's way, will remove the 
insurgency's very raison d'etre and put Iraq on track toward national healing 
and reconciliation. 
<P>President Bush, however, has chosen escalation over withdrawal, a choice 
that is tragically misguided and, with virtually no political support, 
ultimately unsustainable. No less of a militarist than Oliver North has 
concluded that "sending more U.S. combat troops is simply sending more 
targets."  
<P>The president ignored the advice of the Iraq Study Group, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, and the soon-to-be-replaced Gens. George W. Casey Jr. and John P. 
Abizaid (despite the president's repeated insistence that he takes his cues 
from "commanders on the ground"). This staggering act of presidential arrogance 
flies in the face of public opinion and reveals nothing but contempt for the 
electoral verdict delivered by the American voters in November.  
<P>That's why today I am proposing my own plan to bring our troops home, and 
restore Iraqi sovereignty. 
<P>Because of the election and its mandate, the president can no longer 
expect carte blanche from the House and Senate. As a co-equal branch of 
government with constitutional war powers, we in the Congress are within our 
rights to challenge and even forestall both the overall Bush policy and the new 
deployment of more than 21,500 troops. That the 109th Congress chose not to 
exercise such authority will not  --  and should not  --  restrain the 110th.
