<p>Four months after voters brought in a Democratic-controlled Congress to relieve the Middle East game, Congress rejected the commander-in-chief's plan to deploy more troops to the Iraq War. This first pitch, as much for show as for tell, was so soft and wide of the plate that it will not likely get the full attention of President George W. Bush.

<p>One knowledgeable former, high-ranking U.S. official claims that Bush announced his "surge" only after it was initiated and that Congress is debating a moot point. No matter, Congress is certain to deliver harder and tighter pitches that will perhaps set up an epic struggle between the legislative and executive branches.

<p>What is the best course for Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney? Instead of blaming Iran, its Quds and the Mohawk Indians for the battlefield deaths of American troops, Bush should self-impeach his administration for cooking up false pretenses to send GIs off to a needless - and now unmanageable - war.

<p>Accepting blame should not be new to a commander-in-chief who wasted his middle years with the whiskey bottle - and supposedly recovered. The first step of his withdrawal requires Bush to admit that, having started it, he lacks the capacity to end it. The power to recover this time resides not in the heavens but in the checks and balances of the tripartite U.S. government the executive branch completely defused - until the November elections.

<p>Hell-bent on escalation, the president has shown no sign of wanting recovery. After rehearsing how to pronounce its name, he trotted out the elite Iranian combat unit as a new target at his Wednesday press conference. "I can say with certainty that the Quds force, a part of the Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated [weapons] that have harmed our troops," he said.

<p>Earlier, the administration had pinned blame for these weapons, that reportedly killed some 170 GIs, on the "highest levels" of the Iranian government - that is to say on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad himself. Unable to stir-fry up the supporting intelligence data quickly enough, the president appeared to back away from this pretense.

<p>"I do not know whether or not the Quds force was ordered from the top echelons of the government," Bush said. "But my point is, what's worse, them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening?"

<p>By White House reckoning, "them ordering it and it happening" would be far better, for it would allow the president to proceed against Iran, as he likely intends, under the thin guise of a provocation - not that one is needed under the divine right of pre-emptive war he has undertaken.

<p>"Evidence" of a provocation when Bush-Cheney attacked Iraq, of course, proved to have been phantom. Consequently, the U.S. force occupying Iraq is as illegal as a squad of cops without a warrant storming into a private home no matter how corrupt the father is thought to be. After hanging the father, killing his sons and murdering tens of thousands of bystanders, Bush-Cheney is itching to slaughter uninvolved neighbors across the border. This White House duo, who cowardly avoided combat in their youth, seems as slavishly hooked on blood-letting as a drunk on vodka or a junkie on methamphetamine.

<p>This addictive U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, unfortunately, is eroding the good name and treasure of the American people who rose up in November and voted for the madness to end.

<p>Meanwhile, Bush spits in the eye of the people by barreling ahead with his "surge" and perhaps preparing to attack Iran. Key former high-level U.S. officials have observed with alarm that the U.S. Navy has been dispatched to the Persian Gulf for maneuvers at the same time that Iran is conducting "exercises."

<p>Such brazen sea jockeying was said to be a possible prelude to attack, not unlike the "attacks" on the USS Maddox and the USS Turner Joy in the Gulf of Tonkin that led to the the Vietnam buildup.

<p>The ensuing toll in lives and resources need not accrue in the Iraq war if Bush submits to a recovery program. Otherwise, Congress has no choice if the republic is to survive under the semblance of the rule of law.

<p>Stay tuned.
