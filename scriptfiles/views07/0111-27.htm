<p>There will be timetables, deadlines, benchmarks, goals for both America and its Iraqi satraps. But the war against terror can still be won. We shall prevail. Victory or death. And it shall be death. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  President Bush's announcement early this morning tolled every bell. A 
  billion dollars of extra aid for Iraq, a diary of future success as the Shia 
  powers of Iraq &shy; still to be referred to as the "democratically 
  elected government" &shy; march in lockstep with America's best men and 
  women to restore order and strike fear into the hearts of al-Qa'ida. It will 
  take time &shy; oh, yes, it will take years, at least three in the words of 
  Washington's top commander in the field, General Raymond Odierno this week &shy; 
  but the mission will be accomplished.

</p>
<p>
  Mission accomplished. Wasn't that the refrain almost four years ago, on that 
  lonely aircraft carrier off California, Bush striding the deck in his flying 
  suit? And only a few months later, the President had a message for Osama bin 
  Laden and the insurgents of Iraq. "Bring 'em on!" he shouted. And 
  on they came. Few paid attention late last year when the Islamist leadership 
  of this most ferocious of Arab rebellions proclaimed Bush a war criminal but 
  asked him not to withdraw his troops. "We haven't yet killed enough of 
  them," their videotaped statement announced. 
</p>
<p>
  Well, they will have their chance now. How ironic that it was the ghastly 
  Saddam, dignified amid his lynch mob, who dared on the scaffold to tell the 
  truth which Bush and Blair would not utter: that Iraq has become "hell"
.
</p>
<p>
  It is de rigueur, these days, to recall Vietnam, the false victories, the 
  body counts, the torture and the murders &shy; but history is littered with 
  powerful men who thought they could batter their way to victory against the 
  odds. Napoleon comes to mind; not the emperor who retreated from Moscow, but 
  the man who believed the wild guerrilleros of French-occupied Spain could be 
  liquidated. He tortured them, he executed them, he propped up a local 
  Spanish administration of what we would now call Quislings, al-Malikis to a 
  man. He rightly accused his enemies &shy; Moore and Wellington &shy; of supporting 
  the insurgents. And when faced with defeat, Napoleon took the personal 
  decision "to relaunch the machine" and advanced to recapture 
  Madrid, just as Bush intends to recapture Baghdad. Of course, it ended in 
  disaster. And George Bush is no Napoleon Bonaparte.

</p>
<p>
  No, I would turn to another, less flamboyant, far more modern politician for 
  prophecy, an American who understood, just before the 2003 launch of Bush's 
  illegal invasion of Iraq, what would happen to the arrogance of power. For 
  their relevance this morning, the words of the conservative politician Pat 
  Buchanan deserve to be written in marble:
</p>
<p>
  "We will soon launch an imperial war on Iraq with all the 'On to 
  Berlin' bravado with which French poilus and British tommies marched in 
  August 1914. But this invasion will not be the cakewalk neoconservatives 
  predict ... For a militant Islam that holds in thrall scores of millions of 
  true believers will never accept George Bush dictating the destiny of the 
  Islamic world ... 
</p>
<p>
  "The one endeavour at which Islamic peoples excel is expelling imperial 
  powers by terror and guerrilla war. They drove the Brits out of Palestine 
  and Aden, the French out of Algeria, the Russians out of Afghanistan, the 
  Americans out of Somalia and Beirut, the Israelis out of Lebanon... We have 
  started up the road to empire and over the next hill we will meet those who 
  went before."
</p>
<p>
  But George Bush dare not see these armies of the past, their ghosts as 
  palpable as the phantoms of the 3,000 Americans &shy; let us forget the hundreds 
  of thousands of Iraqis &shy; already done to death in this obscene war, and 
  those future spirits of the dead still living amid the 20,000 men and women 
  whom Bush is now sending to Iraq. In Baghdad, they will move into both Sunni 
  and Shia "insurgent strongholds" &shy; as opposed to just the Sunni 
  variety which they vainly invested in the autumn &shy; because this time, and 
  again I quote General Odierno, it is crucial the security plan be "
  evenhanded". This time, he said, "we have to have a believable 
  approach, of going after Sunni and Shia extremists". 

</p>
<p>
  But a "believable approach" is what Bush does not have. The days 
  of even-handed oppression disappeared in the aftermath of invasion. 
</p>
<p>
  "Democracy" should have been introduced at the start &shy; not delayed 
  until the Shias threatened to join the insurgency if Paul Bremer, America's 
  second proconsul, did not hold elections &shy; just as the American military 
  should have prevented the anarchy of April 2003. The killing of 14 Sunni 
  civilians by US paratroopers at Fallujah that spring set the seal on the 
  insurgency. Yes, Syria and Iran could help George Bush. But Tehran was part 
  of his toytown "Axis of Evil", Damascus a mere satellite. They 
  were to be future prey, once Project Iraq proved successful. Then there came 
  the shame of our torture, our murders, the mass ethnic cleansing in the land 
  we said we had liberated.
</p>
<p>
  And so more US troops must die, sacrificed for those who have already died. 
  We cannot betray those who have been killed. It is a lie, of course. Every 
  desperate man keeps gambling, preferably with other men's lives.
</p>

<p>
  But the Bushes and Blairs have experienced war through television and 
  Hollywood; this is both their illusion and their shield. 
</p>
<p>
  Historians will one day ask if the West did not plunge into its Middle East 
  catastrophe so blithely because not one member of any Western government &shy; 
  except Colin Powell, and he has shuffled off stage &shy; ever fought in a war. 
  The Churchills have gone, used as a wardrobe for a prime minister who lied 
  to his people and a president who, given the chance to fight for his 
  country, felt his Vietnam mission was to defend the skies over Texas. 
</p>
<p>
  But still he talks of victory, as ignorant of the past as he is of the 
  future.
</p>
<p>

  Pat Buchanan ended his prophecy with imperishable words: "The only 
  lesson we learn from history is that we do not learn from history."
</p>
<p>
   <b>The Bush plan, and the question of withdrawal</b>
</p>
<p>
   <b>What Bush says</b>
</p>
<p>
   <b>20,000 troops increase</b>

</p>
<p>
  Mistake of not sending sufficient troops must be rectified. Troops stabilise 
  Baghdad and reinforce Anbar province, on condition that Iraqis take on Shia 
  militias
</p>
<p>
   <b>$1bn reconstruction aid</b>
</p>
<p>
  Fresh funds will help create jobs and stimulate economy to show Iraqis there 
  can be a peace dividend, and friendly Middle East states should help out too
</p>
<p>
   <b>Pullout</b>

</p>
<p>
  US commitment to Iraq is not open-ended but no timetable for troop 
  withdrawal, even though US troops are expected to hand control to Iraqis by 
  November
</p>
<p>
   <b>What Congress says</b>
</p>
<p>
   <b>20,000 troops increase</b>
</p>
<p>
  Troop build-up is a mistake. House expected to vote on increase, Senate 
  legislation forces Bush to seek congressional approval but neither move 
  could block troop deployment

</p>
<p>
   <b>$1bn reconstruction aid</b>
</p>
<p>
  Don't throw good money after bad. US has squandered billions since the 
  invasion and Democrats plan investigation. Millions of dollars 'overpaid' by 
  Pentagon to Iraq contractors
</p>
<p>
   <b>Pullout</b>
</p>
<p>
  Bush has not learnt the lesson of November's mid-term elections which gave 
  Democrats control of the House and Senate on the platform of a phased 
  withdrawal from Iraq

</p>
<p>
   <b>What Baker says</b>
</p>
<p>
   <b>20,000 troops increase</b>
</p>
<p>
  Up to 20,000 military trainers and troops embedded into and supporting Iraqi 
  army, while combat troops drawn down to avoid increase in total numbers
</p>
<p>
   <b>$1bn reconstruction aid</b>

</p>
<p>
  US economic assistance should be boosted to $5bn per year. US should take 
  anti-corruption measures by posting oil contracts on the internet for 
  outside scrutiny
</p>
<p>
   <b>Pullout</b>
</p>
<p>
  All US combat troops not needed for force protection should be out of Iraq 
  by the first quarter of 2008
</p>
<p>
   <b>Likely outcome</b>

</p>
<p>
   <b>20,000 troops increase</b>
</p>
<p>
  Escalation of conflict
</p>
<p>
  Money will be wasted, with official corruption in Iraq said to drain $7bn a 
  year
</p>
<p>
   <b>Pullout</b>

</p>
<p>
  Troop surge could disguise 'cut and run' depending on the circumstances in 
  both Iraq and America
