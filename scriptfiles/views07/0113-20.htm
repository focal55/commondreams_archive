<p>The boiling, surging, churning and corporatizing economy of the United 
States is racing far ahead of its being understood by political 
economists, economists, politicians and the polis itself. Tidbits from 
the past week add up to this view, to wit:

<p>--The giant, shut-down Bethlehem steel plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 
will soon become a $600 million casino and hotel complex. With tens of 
millions of Americans lacking the adequate necessities of food, fuel, 
shelter, health care and a sustaining job, this project is part of a 25 
year trend by the economy, moving away from necessities and over to 
wants and whims. Among the fastest growing businesses for three decades 
in America are theme parks, gambling casinos and prisons.

<p>--Our Constitution launched "we the people" to "establish justice, 
.promote the general welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 
ourselves." We're losing ground year after year on all three accounts. 
Yet to what does Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. devote his /entire/ 
annual report on the federal judiciary this January 1, 2007? He called 
for a pay raise for judges, calling the current pay ranging from 
$165,200 to $212,000 (with a great retirement plan) a "constitutional 
crisis."

<p>--General Motor has introduced yet another prototype electric car-called 
the Chevrolet Volt-to distract attention from its ongoing engine 
stagnation and provide a little cover for its gas guzzling muscle cars 
displayed at the Detroit Auto Show. This procrastinatory tactic by GM 
has been going on since the 1939 New York World's Fair to keep people 
looking far into the amorphous future so as to not focus on the dismal 
today year after year while gasoline prices sky rocket and oil imports 
swell. We're still waiting for some of GM's engineering prototypes from 
1939 to hit the road in the 21^st century.

<p>--Just as there are stirrings behind more shareholder rights over the 
companies they own and more disclosure by management of large 
corporations relating to executive pay and accounting information, the 
rapid rise of huge pools of capital controlled by private equity firms 
and Hedge Funds are buying larger and larger public companies and taking 
them out of the regulatory arenas into secrecy.

<p>Corporate morphing to escape public accountability has been going on for 
a long time. Note the coal corporations digging deep under residential 
streets in Pennsylvania and other neighboring states decades ago. As the 
homes began to cave in (this is called 'subsidence'), the coal companies 
disappeared by collapsing themselves only to be succeeded by their next 
of (corporate) kin.

<p>Today, this corporate morphing is far more ranging and far larger in the 
economy, drawing trillions of dollars from pension funds and 
institutional investor firms which themselves are largely closed off 
from workers and small investors whose money they shuffle around. 
Corporate attorneys are super-experts in arranging ways for corporate 
capital to escape not just the tax laws of the U.S. but also the public 
regulatory frameworks of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
other public "law and order" entities.

<p>Independent and academic corporate analysts have barely begun to figure 
out the consequences of this seismic shift of capital structures.

<p>--"Private Firms Lure C.E.O.'s With Top Pay" was the headline in the 
January 8^th edition of /The New York Times/. The subtitle was 
astonishingly worded as "Less Lavish Packages at Public Companies." The 
reporters go on to say, in essence, if you think that Home Depot's 
departed C.E.O., Robert L. Nardelli's $200 million plus take home pay 
package was a lot, you haven't seen what's happening behind the curtains 
at the large private equity firms buying up ever bigger public 
companies. "Public company chieftains are deciding that they no longer 
want to be judged by their shareholders and regulators, and are going to 
work for businesses owned by private equity," write the authors.

<p>One such migrant executive, Henry Silverman, went from big riches 
running the conglomerate Cendant, to making $135 million just from 
selling one piece of Cendant, Realogy, to a private equity firm. "There 
is no reason to be a public company anymore," said this happy corporate 
prophet.

<p>Now go to the other side of the tracks. In the last quarter century the 
value of the U.S. corporations has risen 12-fold, according to /The Wall 
Street Journal. /C.E.O. pay has skyrocketed similarly. But workers 
today, on average, are still making less, in inflation adjusted dollars, 
than workers made in 1973-the high point of worker wages!

<p>Citing data from the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern 
University, /New York// Times'/ columnist, Bob Herbert, reports that 
between 2000 and 2006 the combined real annual earnings of 93 million 
American workers rose by $15.4 billion. That rise is "less than half of 
the combined bonuses awarded by the five Wall Street firms for just one 
year."

<p>Class warfare in reverse is what's going on. The super rich and their 
corporations against the workers, redistributing the workers' wealth 
into their own pockets and coffers. Mr. Herbert frequently frets about 
no one in the political parties saying or doing anything about this 
state of despair. He defines "political parties" as the two major 
Parties, though knowing full well that there are smaller parties and 
independent candidates who have campaigned across the country trumpeting 
the need for economic justice in very specific terms.

<p>So long as most progressive writers ignore these people in the electoral 
arenas who are laboring to break down the barriers that keep these 
issues of economic justice over corporate power abuses from moving into 
elections and government, they will be bellowing in the wind.

<p>Social justice movements in the United States have come from small 
starts that are duly recognized.
