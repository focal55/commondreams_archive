Ouch. It hurts to listen to. This was Representative John Conyers,
<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/16/1548232" target="_new">speaking</a> to a troops-out demonstration this past January in Washington
DC:
</p>
<p>
"George Bush has a habit of firing military leaders who tell him the
Iraq war is failing. But let me tell you something. He can't fire you.
He can't fire us. But we can fire him!"  
</p>
<p>
Many took those words to mean that Conyers, the chair of the House
Judiciary Committee, was serious about firing this president, meaning,
impeaching the man, along with the vice president he rode in on.
</p>
<p>
But this was Conyers, progressive Democrat of Michigan, speaking
recently on Pacifica's <i>Democracy Now</i>, explaining why, although he has
the authority, he's not going to initiate impeachment proceedings.

     

<p>
"Impeachments come to the Judiciary Commitee. And, believe me, to tie
up this government just as we're trying to stop the war and the clock
is running on both the President and the Vice President, I think would
be a mistaken strategy. We've got to win the next election which is
next year."
</p>
<p>
Winning the election, he told <i>Democracy Now</i>, is what he meant by
"firing" the president. Yeah right. Like firing a senior on the day he
graduates. It hurts to listen to because what you're hearing is the
sound of consciousness – razing -- as in razor, as in destroy or level
or scrape. What you're hearing is the leveling, scraping away of a
man's conscience. Probably no one's done more than Representative
Conyers and his staff have done to investigate Bush White House crimes,
from wiretapping and torture to misleading the country into an illegal
war.
</p>
<p>
Luckily for Rep. Conyers, grassroots activists may save his conscience
yet.
</p>
<p>
This week in Olympia, Washington, more than 800 people packed into a meeting
with Elizabeth De La Vega and State Senator Eric Oemig, who is
introducing a <a href="http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/node/18609" target="_new">resolution</a> to petition the US House for impeachements.
About half that number worked throughout last weekend to come up with a
national strategy on which impeachment activists could unite. A lot is
going on on the impeachment front. It's just been hard to see.
Different groups have prioritized different grounds for impeachment--there's no shortage-- from Iraq, to Guatánamo to signing statements
and illegal  wiretapping and gross negligence in hurricane Katrina's
wake.
</p>

<p>
Now a broad array of organizations have launched a new coalition that
brings scores of groups together, from the Center for Constitutional
Rights to Hip Hop Caucus, to Progressive Democrats of
America, Code Pink, After Downing Street, the Green Party of the USA
and The World Can't Wait.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.impeach07.org/" target="_new">Impeach07</a> has national and local demonstrations planned, along with a
national day of action on April 28. Oemig isn't alone. Legislators in
three states--New Mexico, Washington and Vermont have made moves
towards petitioning the Congress. And no topic provokes more calls to
RadioNation on Air America--people want accountability even if their
leaders don't.
