The most important battle in Washington
today is not the shouting match between Congress and the White House on
Iraq. The Bush administration will do what it damn well pleases in
Iraq, and then blame the resulting catastrophe on Democrats, the media
or Iran.
<p>Ah, there's the catch. The important battle in Washington is over
Iran, and neither Congress nor the mainstream media seems to be
playing. They should — another mistake here and the Middle East will be
Iraq writ large.</p>

<p>Combatants here are the familiar neoconservatives, centered on Vice
President Dick Cheney and the others who manipulated us into Iraq,
versus what might be called Friends of the Iraq Study Group. It's talk
or bomb, and although at the moment it appears talking is the preferred
option, never count the aggressive neocons out of the argument.</p>

<p>An ambitious "regime change" plan for Iran was first choice of many
neocons before 9/11, but was sidetracked because Iran was actually
helping us against the Taliban and because Iraq was considered an
easier target. But Iranian regime change never went off the neocon
table, and when Iran's nuclear ambitions surfaced, so did the old plans.</p>

<p>There are disconcerting reminders of 1964, when President Lyndon B.
Johnson used trumped-up evidence of an attack in the Gulf of Tonkin to
expand the Vietnam War. Today, two carrier groups are parked off Iran,
tempting targets for any wacko with a gunboat full of dynamite.</p>

<p>We have captured and questioned hundreds of Iranians in Iraq,
including some with diplomatic status. We are actively involved in
building an insurgency inside Iran, using Kurdish tribes in the north
and urban Marxist terrorists in Tehran. The neocons even have an
Iranian counterpart to Ahmad Chalabi, the notorious liar and neocon
favorite who fed us false intelligence on Iraq: a seamy Iranian named
Manucher Ghorbanifar, an arms dealer and con artist linked to Oliver
North during Iran-contra 20 years ago.</p>

<p>We are even hearing a renewal of the "domino theory" so discredited
in Vietnam. "Most thoughtful people believe," Democratic hopeful John
Edwards told a reporter, "that if Iran goes nuclear that the Saudis
will go nuclear, the Egyptians will go nuclear, the Jordanians may go
nuclear ... " Edwards wants "a thoughtful diplomatic process." Quickly,
we hope, before Bahrain gets the bomb!</p>

<p>All of these actions can be seen as either "showing tough" to Iran
or as goading Iranians to do something provocative, giving us an excuse
to bomb their nuclear facilities. Add to this the itchy trigger finger
of Israel, which no American politician dares criticize, and things
become very dicey.</p>

<p>As with Iraq in 2002, the mainstream media are telling us little
about backroom maneuverings focusing on Iran. The most effective
journalism on this comes from three magazines, none of which much
reaches the American heartland: The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Rolling
Stone. Backroom plotting doesn't play as well on television as pictures
of suspected Iran-made roadside bombs.</p>

<p>Although it is far too early to count the neocons out — not while
Cheney has Bush's ear — there are signs of a cooling of the
regime-change rhetoric. Superhawk John Bolton has lost his United
Nations platform, and some of the neocons at the Pentagon are gone.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice seems to be growing into her
diplomatic role and she has access to the Oval Office that was not
available to Colin Powell.</p>

<p>Within Iran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's populist demagoguery
may be losing popularity, pressed on one side by young urbanites who
want attention paid to economic and social demands and on the other by
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has recently left the door
open to negotiations on Iran's nuclear future.</p>

<p>An American or Israeli air strike, however, would rally Iranians to Ahmadinejad and inflame Islamists across the region.</p>

<p>All these circumstances combine to make direct negotiations with
Iraq's neighbors critical, as recommended by the Iraq Study Group. Pay
no attention to the public comments of White House spokesmen — they are
not credible — pay attention to what the White House actually does. If
we engage in serious talks with Iran, it's positive even if the
president won't admit a change of course.</p>

<p>Congressional Democrats must support the talks and reject the bombs.
Iraq is gone, regardless of what President Bush does in his last 20
months. But if he launches — or allows Israel to launch — preemptive
strikes on Iran, his successor will inherit a worse mess than Bush
faced on Sept. 12, 2001.</p>
