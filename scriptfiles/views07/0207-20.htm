<p>Up until recently I've defined "soul food" narrowly as the traditional 
Southern fare born out of slavery and forced frugality. But the more 
food I grow for myself and my family, the more food I buy from local 
farmers and fishers, and the more recipes I create with the food of my 
bioregion, the more I understand soul food as food that nourishes the 
body, mind, and spirit, preserves the landscape, and embraces the 
connection between culture and diet. In contrast, the more time I spend 
outside of my food utopia at Forest Farm the more I wonder, what the 
hell has happened to food in America? Who stole the soul from our food?

<p>I'm often reminded by my neighbor and organic farmer Eliot Coleman that 
the best cuisines in the world have all come from peasant cultures. It's 
not a difficult conclusion to come to if one recognizes that all 
throughout history the responsibility of growing, preparing, and cooking 
food has fallen on the poor, the peasants, and the working class. Using 
what was available, which usually meant what was grown locally and 
seasonally, our ancestors transformed what they had into wonderful and 
nourishing foods. Dinner wasn't the only thing coming out of those 
kitchens; rituals, traditions, and cultures were created, too.

<p>While here in America we are still burdened by an underclass of farmers 
and food workers, the modern day serfs, slaves, and peasants, it is hard 
to compare the food that has come to dominate the American landscape to 
the food of Italy, Thailand, Mexico, or just about any other nation on 
earth that still has food traditions intact. For the first time in the 
history of our civilization, people who are connected to the land and 
sea for their livelihood are no longer the creators of food culture and 
tradition. Whereas diet was once determined by what the land and sea 
produced, food in America today is determined by what can be produced 
cheapest, in the highest quantity, and that can be packed so full of 
artificial ingredients that it can be shipped thousands of miles and 
stored for weeks, months, or even years. Worldwide, cultures built upon 
fresh, nourishing food are being replaced by an extractive industrial 
food system that is based on the narrow values of progress, efficiency, 
and profit.

<p>Here in Maine this is clear as day. One-hundred-and-fifty-years ago 
Maine was the breadbasket of northern New England, providing a diverse 
range of plant and animal foods for its citizens and sending surplus to 
the markets of Portsmouth and Boston. Maine was even self-sufficient in 
sugar, producing maple and beet sugars. But like so many agricultural 
nations and states around the world, concentrated agribusiness and fast 
food culture has relegated Maine to an exporter of commodities and 
luxury goods and an importer of basic essentials.

<p>But the tide it turning. Organizations and groups like <a href="http://www.foodformainesfuture.org/index.php" target="_new">Food for Maine's 
Future</a> and <a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.html" target="_new">Slow Food</a> are reclaiming a culture of food built upon 
economic fairness, ecological sanity, and good taste. At the grassroots, 
farmers, fishers, activists, and consumers are coming together to create 
food independence and food /interdependence./ Because in the end, we are 
all stakeholders in our food system, good or bad. We are all eaters.

<p>And in the halls of the Maine state house, the Protect Maine Farmer's 
campaign is working hard to represent concerned Maine citizens who 
believe it is the role of our state government to recognize and protect 
Maine's agricultural heritage and legacy, and to ensure that Maine's 
food producers will have the tools they need to succeed in the decades 
to come.

<p>The soul food train is leaving the station and we've got an eclectic 
band of people from all walks of life who value what they eat, care 
about where it came for, and respect the people, the land, and the sea 
that produced it. There's plenty of room and the food is great. /All 
aboard!
