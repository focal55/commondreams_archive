<p>This month's National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), strategically released on 
Super Bowl weekend, had every news "analyst" referring to it as "sobering." 
The report spells out the two roads to hell we can choose to travel in Iraq: A.) 
Get out now and leave it in chaos or B.) Get out later and leave it in chaos.

<p>Well, we won't be traveling them, exactly, just sending our younguns to pave 
the road with one more sealer coat of American blood, to blend with the Iraqi 
blood spilled now and for years to come. Yeah, sobering.

<p>Even the "surge," it seems, is being bungled by the side formerly known as 
ours. In preparation for the arrival of the additional troops into Baghdad, the 
militias pulled back from checkpoints around the city -- thus, Iraqi leaders 
say, allowing the massive truck bomb easy access to the market where it 
exploded and killed 140 people. Daily attacks continue and nearly 1,000 people have 
been killed in the last week alone. Sobering.

<p>The Iraqi leaders, those who came around to support the surge, are astonished 
that the plan was announced so far in advance of the arrival of troops. I'm 
no warrior, and I'm sure those vaunted generals have a plan, but imagine 
Roosevelt and Churchill announcing D-day months before the troops or equipment were 
ready to hit the beach at Normandy, not to mention without the support of the 
American and British people. Well, that was when the bad guys wore uniforms 
and lived in Germany, and the good guys lived in the White House and No. 10 
Downing Street and we hadn't plummeted down Karl Rove's rabbit hole where night 
really means day.

<p>Those crashing American helicopters are also -- sobering. The Pentagon at 
first said they just crashed. Later we learned that at least some of them were 
shot down, most likely by Sunni militants, who boasted that they have received 
new stocks of anti-aircraft weapons and that "God has granted them new ways" to 
take down U.S. aircraft. Funny, God was thanked for his part in the Super 
Bowl victory as well.

<p>Well, it's sobering all right -- the report, the news, the death, the 
dissembling, the disgusting Republican die-hards who won't even allow debate on the 
Senate floor of the most catastrophic blunder in our nation's history. But as all the sobering talk prattled on, I was wondering: Sobering compared 
to what? Were we all soaring along on the good news until now? Usually the 
sobering part follows the fun part, like coming down after a giddy night on the 
town. What part did I miss? Where was the fun?

<p>I suppose for some it was the mission-accomplished strut across the deck of 
the aircraft carrier. And despite numerous interventions, the Decider and his 
funny Uncle Dick are the only ones who still can't quit. And that's not just 
sobering; it's deadly.
