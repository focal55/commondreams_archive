<p> I invite anyone who remains cynical about the impact of climate change on the planet to visit Bangladesh. We have more floods. Our droughts have become more intense. The biggest mangrove forests in the world - the Sundarbans - are dying. We are losing precious biodiversity. You can see the effects of global warming with your own eyes. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>

  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report released last month 
  made clear the impact climate change could have on the world. But the 
  terrible fact is that, even if all countries signed up to protect the 
  environment, climate change will take its toll because the damage has been 
  done.
</p>
<p>
  For Bangladesh, a low-lying and densely populated country, the consequences 
  are serious and unavoidable. We have learned to live with the kind of floods 
  that come sporadically and last maybe three or four months. But it is 
  estimated that by the end of the century up to 20 per cent of its land will 
  be under water. We are talking about millions of people being displaced by 
  permanent flooding.
</p>
<p>
  These people - those who will be affected the most by climate change - are 
  not the ones who caused it. It is time for the international community to 
  realise that the countries that have damaged the environment will now have 
  to pay for it.
</p>
<p>
  More research is needed so that developing countries can learn how to 
  strengthen their adaptive capacities. In Bangladesh, we need to restructure 
  our development programme to accommodate the global sea rise. The issue of 
  environmental refugees - the people who must be relocated when the floods 
  come - has to be dealt with. We, like all developing nations, need more 
  external funding for in-depth climate change research projects.
</p>
<p>
  A reduction in carbon emissions is also crucial. We are very grateful to 
  those countries who are doing their bit and trying to reduce the levels of 
  their emissions. But the biggest players - the United States and Australia, 
  for example - are not on board.

</p>
<p>
  In this, the question of accountability is paramount. At the moment most 
  Bangladeshis are not angry with anyone in particular because they do not 
  understand the science behind what is happening. But slowly their 
  frustration may turn into anger because this poor country had absolutely 
  nothing to do with global warming. And yet, as ever, it is they who suffer.
