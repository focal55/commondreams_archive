Alarm bells are sounding in Washington, on Wall Street        and around the world over President Hugo Chavez&#8217;s latest moves to        consolidate his Bolivarian Revolution in oil-rich Venezuela. He is &#8212; we        are told &#8212; shutting down a television station, creating a single-party        state, nationalizing key industries, threatening perpetual re-election        and vowing to impose 21st Century socialism.     </p>     <p>       On the surface, it seems to Chavez&#8217;s critics that he is finally doing        what they have long predicted &#8212; creating a totalitarian state in the        image of his mentor, Fidel Castro. But the situation in Venezuela is a        little more complex than what many in the media and the establishment        make it out to be. Take, for example, Chavez&#8217;s decision not to renew the        license of RCTV television network when it expires in May. At first        blush, this would certainly seem to be reason for alarm &#8212; a government        shutting down a television station because it doesn&#8217;t like its editorial        bent.     </p>     <p>       But RCTV is not exactly your average television station. In April 2002,        it promoted and participated in a coup against Chavez in which a        democratically elected president was overthrown by military rebels and        disappeared for two days until large street protests and a counter-coup        returned him to power. For two days before the coup, RCTV suspended all        regular programming and commercials and ran blanket coverage of a        general strike aimed at ousting Chavez. Then it ran non-stop ads        encouraging people to attend a massive anti-Chavez march on April 11,        2002, and provided wall-to-wall coverage of the event itself with nary a        pro-Chavez voice in sight.     </p>     <p>       When the protest ended in violence and military rebels overthrew the        president, RCTV along with other networks imposed a news blackout        banning all coverage of pro-Chavez demonstrators in the streets        demanding his return. Andres Izarra, a news director at RCTV, was given        the order by superiors: no Chavistas on the screen. He quit in disgust        and later joined the Chavez government.     </p>     <p>       On April 13, 2002, after the coup-installed president Pedro Carmona        eliminated the Supreme Court and the National Assembly and nullified the        constitution, media barons, including RCTV&#8217;s main owner, Marcel Granier,        met with Carmona in the presidential palace and, according to reports,        pledged their support to his regime. While the streets of Caracas        literally burned with rage over Chavez&#8217;s ouster, the television networks        ran Hollywood movies like Pretty Woman.     </p>     <p>       Venezuela&#8217;s media, owned largely by the country&#8217;s wealthy elites, is        arguably the most rabidly anti-government media in the world. In the        past, opposition figures have appeared on television openly calling for        a coup against Chavez, who says he is leading a revolution on behalf of        Venezuela&#8217;s majority poor. Chavez&#8217;s decision not to renew RCTV&#8217;s license        is not exactly akin to George W. Bush shutting down CBS or NBC because        they ran a few stories critical of him. If RCTV were operating in the        United States, it&#8217;s doubtful that its actions would last more than a few        minutes with the FCC.     </p>     <p>       Likewise, Chavez is not creating a single-party state as widely reported        but is melding together an amorphous array of parties that support him.        He is not outlawing opposition parties. He has no need to, as he showed        when he glided to a record landslide victory in the Dec. 5 presidential        vote by a 63-37 percent margin in a free and fair election. Chavez also        is not nationalizing the entire economy without compensation to        companies, as Castro did in the early days of the Cuban Revolution, but        rather is buying back a few key strategic utilities such as the CANTV        telecommunications company or taking a majority government share in four        oil projects.     </p>     <p>       While the government has generally compensated owners at fair market        value when it has taken over properties or businesses in the past,        Chavez said that with CANTV it would deduct debts to workers, pensions        and other obligations, including a &#8220;technological debt&#8221; to the state. Of        course, the jury also is out over whether Venezuela&#8217;s government can run        the nationalized companies better than the private sector did. Chavez        also has taken other steps that are cause for concern. His decision to        seek the power to rule by decree on certain matters for the next 18        months raises a red flag, along with his expressed desire to eliminate        term limits. The world should remain vigilant to ensure that a free        press, a free political system and a mixed economy where property rights        are respected remain in place in Venezuela.     </p>     <p>       If Chavez infringes on any of these rights, it should be vigorously        protested and condemned. But so far it hasn&#8217;t happened.     </p>
