DEAR STRAIGHT PEOPLE,<br><br>Why do you hate gay people so much? <br><br>Gays
are hated. Prove me wrong. Your top general just called us immoral.
Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is in charge of
an estimated 65,000 gay and lesbian troops, some fighting for our
country in Iraq. A right-wing political commentator, Ann Coulter, gets
away with calling a straight presidential candidate a faggot. Even
Garrison Keillor, of all people, is making really tacky jokes about gay
parents in his column. This, I guess, does not qualify as hate except
that it is so distasteful and dumb, often a first step on the way to
hate. Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama tried to duck the
questions that Pace's bigotry raised, confirming what gay people know:
that there is not one candidate running for public office anywhere who
dares to come right out, unequivocally, and say decent, supportive
things about us. <br><br>Gays should not vote for any of them. There
is not a candidate or major public figure who would not sell gays down
the river. We have seen this time after time, even from supposedly
progressive politicians such as President Clinton with his "don't ask,
don't tell" policy on gays in the military and his support of the
hideous Defense of Marriage Act. Of course, it's possible that being
shunned by gays will make politicians more popular, but at least we
will have our self-respect. To vote for them is to collude with them in
their utter disdain for us. <br><br>Don't any of you wonder why
heterosexuals treat gays so brutally year after year after year, as
your people take away our manhood, our womanhood, our personhood? Why,
even as we die you don't leave us alone. What we can leave our
surviving lovers is taxed far more punitively than what you leave your
(legal) surviving spouses. Why do you do this? My lover will be unable
to afford to live in the house we have made for each other over our
lifetime together. This does not happen to you. Taxation without
representation is what led to the Revolutionary War. Gay people have
paid all the taxes you have. But you have equality, and we don't.<br><br>

And there's no sign that this situation will change anytime soon.
President Bush will leave a legacy of hate for us that will take many
decades to cleanse. He has packed virtually every court and every civil
service position in the land with people who don't like us. So, even
with the most tolerant of new presidents, gays will be unable to break
free from this yoke of hate. Courts rule against gays with hateful
regularity. And of course the Supreme Court is not going to give us our
equality, and in the end, it is from the Supreme Court that such
equality must come. If all of this is not hate, I do not know what hate
is. <br><br> Our feeble gay movement confines most of its demands to
marriage. But political candidates are not talking about — and we are
not demanding that they talk about — equality. My lover and I don't
want to get married just yet, but we sure want to be equal. <br><br>You
must know that gays get beaten up all the time, all over the world. If
someone beats you up because of who you are — your race or ethnic
origin — that is considered a hate crime. But in most states, gays are
not included in hate crime measures, and Congress has refused to
include us in a federal act.<br><br>Homosexuality is a punishable crime
in a zillion countries, as is any activism on behalf of it. Punishable
means prison. Punishable means death. The U.S. government refused our
requests that it protest after gay teenagers were hanged in Iran, but
it protests many other foreign cruelties. Who cares if a faggot dies?
Parts of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. are joining with the Nigerian
archbishop, who believes gays should be put in prison. Episcopalians!
Whoever thought we'd have to worry about Episcopalians?<br><br>Well,
whoever thought we'd have to worry about Florida? A young gay man was
just killed in Florida because of his sexual orientation. I get reports

of gays slain in our country every week. Few of them make news. Fewer
are prosecuted. Do you consider it acceptable that 20,000 Christian
youths make an annual pilgrimage to San Francisco to pray for gay
souls? This is not free speech. This is another version of hate. It is
all one world of gay-hate. It always was.<br><br>Gays do not realize
that the more we become visible, the more we come out of the closet,
the more we are hated. Don't those of you straights who claim not to
hate us have a responsibility to denounce the hate? Why is it socially
acceptable to joke about "girlie men" or to discriminate against us
legally with "constitutional" amendments banning gay marriage? Because
we cannot marry, we can pass on only a fraction of our estates, we do
not have equal parenting rights and we cannot live with a foreigner we
love who does not have government permission to stay in this country.
These are the equal protections that the Bill of Rights proclaims for
all? <br><br>Why do you hate us so much that you will not permit us to
legally love? I am almost 72, and I have been hated all my life, and I
don't see much change coming.<br><br> I think your hate is evil.<br><br>What
do we do to you that is so awful? Why do you feel compelled to come
after us with such frightful energy? Does this somehow make you feel
safer and legitimate? What possible harm comes to you if we marry, or
are taxed just like you, or are protected from assault by laws that say
it is morally wrong to assault people out of hatred? The reasons always
offered are religious ones, but certainly they are not based on the
love all religions proclaim. <br><br>And even if your objections to
gays are religious, why do you have to legislate them so hatefully?
Make no mistake: Forbidding gay people to love or marry is based on
hate, pure and simple. <br><br> You may say you don't hate us, but the
people you vote for do, so what's the difference? Our own country's
democratic process declares us to be unequal. Which means, in a
democracy, that our enemy is you. You treat us like crumbs. You hate
us. And sadly, we let you.<br>
