<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> The war in Iraq grinds into its fifth bloody year
this week. Back in 2003 the public supported it by a 4-to-1 margin.
Today the numbers have almost flip-flopped, as have most of the
Democratic legislators who voted to authorize the war -- particularly
those running for president.

</p>
<p>
That fateful vote of October 2002 carried both houses more than 2 to 1
with half the Democrats voting "yes," but we hear little about those
bold and insightful souls who opposed the war from the start. It's
fashionable for most who supported the war authorization to say if they
knew then what they know now they would not have voted the way they
did. If only they had known there were no weapons of mass destruction .
. . if only they understood there were no links between al-Qaida and
Iraq . . . if only they were less trusting of the intelligence . . . if
only they realized how badly the war would be run . . . if only . . .</p><p>
Poor John Kerry couldn't utter those words in 2004 and it may have cost
him the election. He did only after President Bush was reinaugurated.</p><p>
The 2008 field includes one former senator and three incumbents who
voted "yes" -- John Edwards, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Chris Dodd.
All now agree they would have voted "no" if they knew then, etc. </p><p>
The difference is whether they admit their "yes" votes were mistakes.
Most do -- Edwards first and most profusely. Clinton, despite what is
now a vigorous anti-war position, somehow cannot bring herself to
acknowledge error. The field includes Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who voted
against the war; also Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, who gave a strong
anti-war speech at a Chicago rally in 2002 when running for office.</p><p>

An interviewer reminded Edwards that Obama was against the war early
on. The former senator snidely noted that Obama, as a mere candidate,
was not "burdened" by the intelligence presented to Congress -- hinting
Obama might have voted differently had he been in office. The answer is
speculative, but it's fair to suppose that Obama would have voted
against the war, along with Illinois senior Sen. Dick Durbin and eight
out of nine Democratic members of the House: Chicagoans Bobby Rush,
Jesse Jackson Jr., William Lipinski, Luis Gutierrez, Danny Davis and
Jan Schakowsky, plus Downstaters Lane Evans and Jerry Costello.</p><p>
Only then-congressman Rod Blagojevich, running for governor, abandoned
fellow Democrats, while Rahm Emanuel, running to succeed him, ran from
the issue. </p><p>

 Who knows why? </p><p>
Pete Visclosky, from an adjacent district in Indiana voted no -- as did
Republicans John Hostettler of Indiana and Jim Leach of Iowa. In all,
six brave Republicans joined 127 House Democrats opposing the war.</p><p>
The big issue that's never been pursued in questioning Edwards,
Clinton, Biden and others is why they were gulled by the bad
intelligence or trusted Bush more than 21 other Democratic senators.
The 21 came from all across the nation, not just liberal Massachusetts
where Ted Kennedy voted "no" while Kerry strangely didn't join his role
model. Nays also came from New England's Republican Lincoln Chafee and
Republican-Independent Jim Jeffords. </p><p>
Was it ideology, a lack of insight, a too-great trust of Bush or simply
fearful politics and a failure of nerve that led generally sound
thinkers such as Biden, Clinton, Dodd, Edwards and other Democrats to
vote as they did?</p><p>
You expected the usual suspects -- progressives Barbara Boxer of
California, Pat Leahy of Vermont and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin -- to
vote "no," with Minnesota's late Paul Wellstone, up for re-election.
But Senate dean Robert Byrd from red-state West Virginia -- no great
liberal -- voted against and continues the fight. Military expert Bob
Graham of red-state Florida, a candidate for president in 2004,
recognized the bad intelligence and called for a "no" vote.</p><p>
Why weren't more listening to them, or to Michigan's highly respected
Carl Levin? Kent Conrad, from Bush-loving North Dakota and Jeff
Bingaman from New Mexico were paying heed -- why weren't Biden, Dodd
and Edwards?</p><p>

Ask Clinton why she didn't join women Patty Murray of Washington State,
Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. </p><p>
Speeches by Murray and many others cut through the cloud of
cherry-picked intelligence and easily foresaw the disaster to follow
the initial military phase. As Murray presciently put it: "Without a
clear objective, victory cannot be measured. Indeed, it appears the
administration established a solution -- going to war -- before it
defined the problem or the goal. . . . I'm very concerned that a
unilateral race to make war on Iraq will weaken the support we need
worldwide to win the war on terrorism."</p><p>

It was all clear back then.</p><p>
On this tragic anniversary, saluting the wise, courageous legislators
who voted "no," we also must question the judgment of those who voted
to give Bush his predictably disastrous war. Especially those who want
to lead us now.</p><p>
