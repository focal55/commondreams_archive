<p>On Tuesday — to ritualized hoots of derision from around the globe —
the U.S. Department of State released its 2006 Country Reports on Human
Rights Practices. The annual reports detail "the status of
internationally recognized human rights" in virtually every country in
the world — except, of course, the U.S. itself. <br><br>

At first glance, this year's reports contain few surprises. The State
Department laments the genocide in Darfur, notes that Russia has
experienced a "further erosion of government accountability" and
reminds us that Cuba denies its citizens "the fundamental right to
change their government peacefully." The reports also document rights
abuses in China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, North Korea —
in fact, pretty much all over the place. Even tiny Monaco is rebuked
for denying its citizens "the right to change their government or
denounce the royal family." <br><br>Although the State Department
announces the annual reports with fanfare, the rest of the world rarely
responds with enthusiasm. This year is no exception. China, a perennial
target, declared that "the United States has lorded it over other
countries by condemning other countries' human rights practices while
ignoring its own problems." Other foreign commentators also complained
about U.S. hypocrisy. After Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, Haditha and
other highly publicized human rights controversies, they wondered,
where does the U.S. get off casting stones at others? <br><br>There's
nothing inherently sinister about the State Department's failure to
include a chapter on U.S. human rights abuses in the reports.
Originally intended for internal government consumption, the reports
were designed to help Congress determine which lucky nations would
receive foreign aid. (Back in the day, Congress had a quaint tradition
of insisting that the U.S. not provide security assistance to foreign
governments responsible for "gross violations" of human rights.)
Because — by definition — the U.S. doesn't provide foreign aid to
itself, there was traditionally no reason for the reports to detail
U.S. human rights lapses.<br><br>But over the years, the country
reports have evolved far beyond their original purpose, becoming a
high-visibility part of U.S. public diplomacy. As a result, they're
inevitably scrutinized with care, both for what they say and what they
don't say.<br><br>On close examination, this year's reports are notable for several major omissions — and one intriguing inclusion. <br><br>First,
the intriguing inclusion: This year's reports contain an unusual — if
elliptical — acknowledgment of serious U.S. failings. "We recognize
that we are writing this report at a time when our own record, and
actions we have taken to respond to the terrorist attacks against us,
have been questioned," notes the introduction, which goes on to insist
that "U.S. laws, policies and practices governing the detention,
treatment and trial of terrorist suspects have evolved considerably
over the last five years." It ain't much, but it's significant.<br><br>
In the sausage factory of the executive branch, phrases like those only
end up in the annual country reports after months of interagency
slicing and dicing. Those unprecedented sentences survived because
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice fought for them — and won, beating
back opposition that came mainly from Vice President Dick Cheney's
office. No one should view this as a dramatic turnaround, but it
suggests a growing administration awareness of just how much U.S.
credibility has suffered as a result of post-9/11 human rights abuses.<br><br>Still, those important sentences are undermined by some glaring omissions in the country reports.<br><br>The
report on Iraq, for instance, contains harsh words for the government,
decrying "overcrowding and lack of judicial oversight" in Iraqi prisons
and detention centers, incidents of "arbitrary arrest and detention"
and "instances of torture and other abuses by government agents and by
illegal armed groups." Not mentioned at all: The U.S. itself holds
about 14,000 detainees in Iraq. Although some U.S. officials
acknowledge that many of these detainees are probably innocent, most
have never had any meaningful opportunity to challenge their detention.
Meanwhile, credible allegations of detainee abuse persist.<br><br>Similarly,
the report on Afghanistan highlights serious abuses by the Taliban and
the Afghan government but makes no mention of the hundreds of detainees
still held in Afghanistan by U.S. military and intelligence agencies.
Reports on Poland, Romania, Germany and Italy contain no references to
investigations into secret U.S. detention facilities or the illegal
U.S. abduction and transfer of terror suspects to third countries that
use torture. <br><br>But in the end, though their omissions expose the
U.S. to charges of hypocrisy, the annual country reports remain
valuable. Not least, the reports represent an ongoing U.S.
acknowledgment that core human rights norms <i>ought</i> to be respected by all — even though the U.S. has lately been a notorious violator. <br><br>In
1655, La Rochefoucauld wrote that "hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to
virtue." If that's true, there's hope for the U.S. government yet.
