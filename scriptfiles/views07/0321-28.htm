<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">The American people 
		tried to wake President George W. Bush out of his fantasies with last 
		November's elections. The Democratic victory signaled our distress over 
		Iraq, which has killed thousands of us and left tens of thousands 
		wounded. The toll is even higher in Iraq, where hundreds of thousand of 
		civilians are dead as a result of the pointless war.&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">However, Mr. Bush 
		won't give up his fantasy. With what amounts to a slap in the face of 
		Congress and the American electorate, he is expanding the war by sending 
		21,500 additional troops.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">The administration 
		has advanced no rational argument suggesting that its Middle East 
		endeavors will either bring peace to Iraq or help resolve the entrenched 
		Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There's no evidence that current policies 
		will yield anything but a prolonged disaster in Baghdad, a new war with 
		Iran and continued turmoil in Lebanon.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">The Iraqi people have 
		no more faith in these policies than we do. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki 
		doesn't want additional American troops in Baghdad. Indeed, he wants the 
		United States out as quickly as possible. A September 2006 poll 
		conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes revealed that 
		7 out of 10 Iraqis want the United States to leave within a year. Iraq's 
		infrastructure is in ruins, the environment, the water and sanitation 
		systems are virtually destroyed, and violence between groups and within 
		groups rage, exacerbated by the lingering U.S. presence.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">

		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">U.S. citizens 
		recognize their responsibilities to themselves and to Iraq. Though our 
		own infrastructure is decaying, we must provide sufficient 
		reconstruction funds for Iraq. The costs of ending the war now will be 
		much less than continuing. In fact, Mr. Bush has requested an additional 
		$93 billion for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq this year and will 
		ask for $142 billion for 2008. His military budget request totals $623 
		billion.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">We need to learn from 
		this debacle. That requires that we reevaluate America's role in the 
		world. As a start, the United States should shift its policies 180 
		degrees in the United Nations and work to establish a program of 
		economic and social development, in which the United States pledges to 
		give between 1 percent and 2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
		for economic development, education and confidence-building measures 
		between peoples and states.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">The United States 
		should also resurrect George Washington's view of "No Passionate 
		Attachments" to any particular nation. In the 21st Century, this entails 
		a passionate attachment to all people, for that is the nature of human 
		rights. Such an idea does not begin with armed conflict. It begins with 
		a careful analysis of how the United States will operate in the world as 
		one of many nations, rather than as the superpower that knows best.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Furthermore, the 
		United States must avoid making more global messes. The nuclear option 
		must be removed from the table, including threats of "preemptive" and 
		"preventive" war. No one should feel secure in a command structure that 
		gives any U.S. president the power and authority to use nuclear weapons 
		in a first strike. Nor should one feel any more secure bestowing that 
		power to any nation that has nuclear weapons, whether it's India, 
		France, China, Israel, Pakistan, Russia or others attempting to acquire 
		them. Instead, negotiations need to go forward on general disarmament 
		and real security, as envisaged by the 1975 Nuclear Nonproliferation 
		Treaty. &nbsp;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">It's also time for 
		the United States to abandon the same tough talk used against Iraq 
		leading up to the 2003 invasion. Two countries presently in the U.S. 
		crosshairs, Syria and Iran, are homes to millions of people and they 
		must be accorded respect by serious discussions leading to negotiations 
		regarding Iraq, the Middle East peace process and Iran's nuclear 
		intentions.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align: justify;">
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">A new course in Iraq 
		and a reevaluation of America's role represents a melding of realism 
		with high aspiration based on cooperation, instead of fear and 
		devastation. If voters can sustain their interest and if the Democratic 
		Party succeeds at leading us into a new era of cooperation rather than 
		conflict leading to wars, sound direction will be set for the next stage 
		of the 21st Century.&nbsp;</span></p>
