   On May 9, 1975, a Senate committee chaired by Frank Church subpoenaed
acting CIA director William Colby during an investigation of
intelligence agencies. Colby (after practice sessions with President
Gerald Ford's chief of staff, Donald Rumsfeld) was grilled about US
covert operations, illegal assassinations and domestic spying abuses.
The stunning revelations of the Church Committee hearings were followed
by several years of rigorous Congressional oversight and reform
legislation.

<p>

How can progressives best grab the momentum from the November elections
to promote bold initiatives to end illegal war, fight poverty and
inequality, and rein in the corporations that are destroying our
democracy? Congressional oversight hearings could be one critical tool.
And that's not as boring as it sounds. 
</p>
<p>

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are in line to chair ten
of the twenty standing House committees and as many as thirty-five
subcommittees. If they are media savvy and work creatively with
activists and affected communities, they could turn humdrum hearings
into blockbuster investigations that wrench the nation's attention away
from Britney and Paris (not the city) and onto the pressing matters of
our time. And while the Democrats' narrow majority will make it
difficult to pass very much progressive legislation in the 110th
Congress, well-designed hearings could lay the foundation for
significant reforms in the medium and long term. 
</p>
<p>

While impeachment may be "off the table," Congress has a duty to
investigate executive-branch misconduct to insure that such abuses of
power never occur again. The wider public will be repulsed if Democrats
appear to copycat GOP partisanship with vindictive investigations rather
than solutions to the nation's urgent problems. Thus, rather
than going for Bush's jugular, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees
will probably first take up the matter of "signing statements"--the
President's practice of indicating the provisions of new laws he doesn't
intend to enforce--which effectively undermine Congressional legislative
intent and powers. This will wisely begin the process of laying out,
case by case, the unconstitutional usurpation of power without
deflecting media coverage from other urgent matters.

</p>
<p>

I have received hundreds of suggestions for hearings (add yours at
<a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/hearings" target="_new">www.ips-dc.org/hearings</a>) and have filtered the ideas through the
following strategic prisms: Do they advance a bold progressive vision
and connect to organized movements? Do they tell dramatic human-interest
stories and lay the groundwork for progressive policy victories? Do they
look forward and showcase new ideas but also put irresponsible
corporations and the Bush agenda on the defensive? What follows are ten
proposed hearings, culled from the suggestions of others and my own
investigations, that would underscore the important progressive
narrative that "we are all in this together" and expose the greed and
selfish corporate interests undermining our common good. 
</p>
<p>

<b>1. The Katrina Divide.</b> When the levees broke, more was revealed than
just FEMA incompetence and presidential indifference. We got a
horrifying picture of an America deeply fractured along lines of
race and class. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita dramatized the results of
two decades of "shift, shrink and shaft" antigovernment policies that,
through privatization and corporate cronyism, have fueled the greatest
polarization of income, wealth and opportunity since the Gilded Age.
</p>
<p>

Congress should team up with grassroots groups to hold hearings in
Biloxi, Mississippi, and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans to keep the
oversight fire lit under FEMA, HUD and other federal agencies. But
hearings must also revisit the larger questions of accountability and
national direction: How did we allow this to happen? How can we prevent
it from happening again? How much economic inequality should our society
tolerate? 
</p>

<p>

<b>2. War Profiteering.</b> During World War II Franklin Roosevelt said, "I
don't want to see a single war millionaire created in the United States
as a result of this world disaster." While FDR set the moral tone, it
was Senator Harry Truman who led a bipartisan investigation that saved
taxpayers more than $15 billion ($200 billion in 2005 dollars). The
current Congress should invoke Give 'em Hell Harry's investigative
legacy by kicking off war-profiteering hearings at the Truman
Presidential Library in Missouri. 
</p>
<p>

The Government Accountability Office recently identified thirty-six
areas needing urgent Congressional oversight. At the top of the list was
investigating the billions squandered by the Defense Department in the
most privatized war in US history. The number of private contractors in
Iraq is now more than 100,000, nearly approaching the size of our
military forces stationed there. Incoming Government Reform
Committee chair Henry Waxman should subpoena CEOs of military
corporations to answer tough questions. He could query Halliburton CEO
David Lesar about his company's waste of taxpayer money and equipment,
overbilling and poor services. George David, CEO of United Technologies,
should be asked why he is suing his Pentagon patrons to block the
release of Black Hawk helicopter inspection reports. David Brooks,
formerly of DHB In- dustries, can explain how many lives were
endangered when the Pentagon was forced to recall 23,000
bulletproof vests of his company's subsidiary--and whether he used
ill-gotten profits to throw a $10 million, celebrity-studded party for
his daughter. Members of military families who held bake sales to buy
body armor for their children fighting in Iraq should also be asked to
give testimony, alongside that of the profiteers.
</p>




   <p>

<b>3. Torture.</b> Congress should investigate and expose the Bush
Administration's involvement in torture and the abhorrent practice of
"extraordinary rendition," the sending of detainees to countries known
for practicing torture. A key witness could be Maher Arar, the Canadian
citizen of Syrian descent who was detained at Kennedy Airport in New
York City in 2002 and accused of having links to Al Qaeda. The United
States "rendered" Arar to Syria, where he was held in a dungeon for ten
months and tortured. Although the Canadian government completely
exonerated Arar and the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
resigned in disgrace, the Bush Administration has refused to clear
Arar's name and to explain why he was "rendered" to Syria. Congressional
hearings should lay the foundation for laws banning engagement in
torture--either by US personnel directly or through outsourcing via
rendition. 
</p>
<p>

<b>4. Unequal Sacrifice and the War.</b> Representative Charles Rangel, the
incoming chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, caused a
ruckus when he proposed reinstituting the draft. But Rangel makes an
important point that hearings could examine further the issue of unequal
sacrifice and how our country's privileged and political elites are AWOL
from military service. 
</p>
<p>

We already have a backdoor draft through the military's use of multiple
deployments and stop-loss policies, which have involuntarily
retained some 85,000 troops beyond their expected or contractually
agreed-upon term of service. Backdoor draft hearings should involve
listening to families at National Guard and military bases
around the country. 
</p>
<p>

Unequal wartime sacrifices have taken their toll on active-duty military
and recently returned veterans. There have been horrifying reports of
traumatized soldiers being returned to combat zones. "We know so many
stories of servicemen and -women with severe post-traumatic stress
syndrome who should be getting the care they need, not facing
redeployment," said Nancy Lessin, co-founder of Military Families Speak
Out (<a href="http://www.mfso.org" target="_new">www.mfso.org</a>). "One mother found her son sitting on his bed with a
pistol in his mouth, contemplating suicide after receiving a letter
putting him on a short list for recall to Iraq--where he had already
served two deployments."

</p>
<p>

Representative Bob Filner, the incoming chair of the Veterans
Affairs Committee, has pledged to convene hearings about the unmet needs
of recently returned veterans and their families. Filner should invite
all other committee chairs and the media to Walter Reed Army Medical
Center in Washington for the first hearing. 
</p>
<p>

<b>5. Runaway CEO Pay.</b> Nothing symbolizes our polarizing "two Americas"
more dramatically than the 411-to-1 ratio of average CEO compensation to
average worker pay. The system is full of perverse incentives for CEOs
to outsource workers, goose stock prices and collect more millions. 
</p>
<p>

Representative Barney Frank, the incoming chair of the House Financial
Services Committee, has already pledged to hold CEO pay hearings. But
the discussion needs to go beyond disclosure reforms to underscore the
profound power imbalance between imperial corporate managers and other
stakeholders, including workers, shareholders and communities. 
</p>
<p>

Hearings are an opportunity to expose and change the culture of greed.
Witnesses should include the abundant number of Warren Buffett-like
business leaders who believe that reining in CEO pay is good for
business. April 2007 hearings should feature the freshly disclosed top
earners from 2006 along with infamous CEO compensation consultants and
Lee Raymond, retired CEO of ExxonMobil, who could be queried about his
$400 million retirement package.
</p>
<p>

<b>6. Wealth Inequality and the Estate Tax.</b> The wealth gap has reached
unprecedented levels--and the racial wealth divide persists despite
expanding homeownership in communities of color. We should investigate
the ways the estate tax, our nation's only tax on inherited wealth, can
help close this wealth divide. 
</p>
<p>

After a decade of hysterical "death tax" propaganda, Congress should
hold hearings to set the record straight about the benefits of taxing
inherited wealth. Hearings could explore how the estate tax could better
reduce the democracy-distorting concentrations of power and wealth--and
whether revenue should be channeled to programs that broaden economic
opportunity.
</p>
<p>

One witness could be Bill Gates Sr., who refers to the estate tax as an
"opportunity recycling program" and urges that revenue from it be
dedicated to a "GI Bill for the next generation." After World War II our
nation expanded opportunities through homeownership programs,
small-business development and grants that enabled millions to get
higher education. Many people of color, however, were excluded from
those programs because of racial bias. Progressives should champion a
bold and inclusive new wealth-broadening program that speaks to the
aspirations of people left behind in our apartheid economy.
</p>



   <p>

<b>7. Concentration of Corporate Power.</b> Twenty-five years after the Reagan
Administration gutted our nation's antitrust enforcement capacity, we
have an unprecedented concentration of corporate power in
virtually every sector of the economy, including banking,
telecommunications, meatpacking and oil refining. Corporate
consolidation corrupts the nation's politics and marketplace, especially
in the media industry. Hearings should not only investigate the impact
of corporate consolidation on consumers but on all levels of the
economy, civic life and culture. Mergers and consolidation in retail,
pharmacy and food industries have extinguished local businesses and
turned Main Streets into bland homogeneous strips. 
</p>
<p>

The House and Senate Judiciary Committees should launch robust antitrust
hearings as a first step in exploring the impact of corporate
concentration on our society. How did corporations gain so much power
with so little social accountability? How have corporations undermined
government oversight, taxation and regulation? Should we rewire the
rules governing transnational corporations, including federal chartering
and monitoring? 
</p>
<p>

<b>8. Oil Industry Influence.</b> As part of the first 100 legislative hours,
incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has pledged that the new Congress
will vote on legislation to eliminate archaic subsidies for Big Oil and
channel funds into alternative energy efforts. Hearings should go
further and expose the corrupting influence of Big Oil lobbying on our
foreign policy, energy policy and tax code. Why has our country remained
addicted to oil? Why do we continue to give privileged status to the
retrograde government of Saudi Arabia? Why will China surpass us in
the next decade as a leader in green energy technologies? From oil
industry involvement in Vice President Cheney's secretive 2001 energy
task force to the myriad provisions inserted into the tax code at the
behest of the oil barons, the hardwired privileges of Big Oil are
pervasive. 

</p>
<p>

Hearings should expose the campaign contributions of Big Oil and their
relation to policy outcomes, laying the groundwork for new and
aggressive campaign finance and lobbying restrictions. Another worthy
topic: the influence of Big Pharma on health policy and the credit-card
industry on lending and bankruptcy laws. 
</p>
<p>

<b>9. Censorship of Climate Science.</b> One of the clearest examples of the
corrosive power of Big Oil can be seen in the debate over global
warming. Here the stakes are no less than the future of the planet.
Climate scientists believe we are at a tipping point--that we must take
dramatic action in the next five years if we are to reverse unbridled
fossil-fuel consumption. But instead of addressing the problem
and leading the nation in adopting appropriate measures, the Bush
Administration has been censoring and suppressing climate science,
setting back our needed responses by a decade.
</p>
<p>

Hearings can make up for lost time by bringing forward leading climate
experts and activists to suggest voluntary and legislative action. But
we must also investigate the Administration's unseemly efforts to censor
or block sound scientific research. Let's subpoena Philip Cooney, the
former oil industry lobbyist who became chief of staff of the White
House Council on Environmental Quality and repeatedly edited
and altered scientific climate reports to downplay links between
greenhouse gases and global warming. 
</p>
<p>

<b>10. A Real Security Budget.</b> Congress's security budgeting process has
little to do with making our country and planet more secure--thanks to
military industry lobbyists, a Pentagon fetish for glitzy weapons and a
Congress that views military pork as an employment program (which
explains why more Homeland Security funds are spent per capita in
Wyoming than in New York City). The common-sense wisdom, from the 911
Commission to peace groups, is that we spend way too much on weapons and
not enough on nonmilitary security efforts, including diplomacy,
effective international aid, peacekeeping and programs to prevent
proliferation of nuclear materials. The Iraq War further drains
resources from nonmilitary strategies, fostering a vicious cycle of
violence.
</p>
<p>

In 2006 a prestigious group of security specialists issued a call for a
"unified security budget," proposing multibillion-dollar shifts in
budget authority between military, homeland security and nonmilitary
measures. But Congress is incapable of moving toward rational budget
allocations because of committee budget fiefdoms. Progressive Democrats
advocating a rational security and foreign policy will run smack into
these structural impediments, including the feeding frenzy over the
Pentagon's daily allowance of about $1.1 billion.
</p>
<p>

Hearings may be helpful, but the entrenched corporate and national
security state interests are so powerful that stronger medicine is
required. Democrats should create a Select Committee on National
Security and International Relations to look at the crosscutting
requirements of the post-cold war world. This select committee should be
empowered to recommend a reorganization of security-related budget
writing that transcends current committee structures. Outside these
hearings, peace and genuine security organizations should utilize
their most creative educational tools, dramatizing the urgency of
reorienting priorities. 
</p>
<p>

Progressive lawmakers should launch several other committees over the
next two years. Members of the Progressive Caucus are proposing a Select
Committee on Poverty, Inequality and Opportunity in the House. A Select
Committee on Federal Elections and Democracy could investigate the
myriad problems with voting technology, voter suppression and the
archaic Electoral College. A Select Committee on Infrastructure could
investigate the condition of our bridges, highways and transportation
systems, as well as our technology infrastructure needs.
</p>
<p>

Don't just ask what your Congress can do for you. Progressive community
activists and independent media need to maximize the synergy between
hearings and organizing, bloggers and policy-makers. The hearings of the
coming year will be what we make of them.
