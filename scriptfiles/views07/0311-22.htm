<p>Captain America is dead, and I’m in mourning. A dirty sniper got him on the steps of a New York court house. Talk about bad timing. Joe Simon, one of his co-creator was quoted as saying, “we really need him now.” We sure do, Joe. What were you guys thinking? Unsavory characters are trying to do the country in, and you guys go and kill off someone vital to national security. Why? Had he decided to go after some of our own bad guys at the top?

 

<p>Captain America and I arrived in this world about the same time. He started out with a bang, punching Hitler out on the cover of his first Marvel comic book. My ordinary infant struggles were less heroic, and I grew up in a country made secure by Captain America and GI Joe. In a few years, I was devoted follower, turning pages and struggling to understand words. Soon it just happened, I could read. It was magic… much more fun than Dick and Jane. 

 

<p>With Captain America you didn’t have to sit through Sunday school to learn about good and evil. He almost made going to church unnecessary. Or, at least that’s how it seems looking back. It was all there in vivid color, action figures and real life villains who had to be defeated. The country’s survival and salvation depended on him, and he was the man for the job. 

 

<p>A song we kids sang could have come straight out of a Captain America comic book. “Whistle while you work. Hitler is a jerk. Mussolini is a meanie. Tojo’s even worse.” Not to worry, Captain America could handle there creeps, and a million more like them. He could defeat all enemies. Funny though, I can’t remember him ever saying, “Bring ‘em on.”

 

<p>When Captain America described evil villains, he was not just blowing smoke; and when he went after a bad guy, there was always a good reason. Maybe the evil-doer had powerful secret weapons, or maybe he was planning a surprise attack that would cripple the nation. Captain America would nail him.  

 

<p>And talk about credibility! If Captain America said it, it was true, no ifs, ands or buts about it. Captain America could be trusted. If he said there were secret weapons, there were secret weapons. If he said one bad guy was working with even worse guys, it was true. When he said mission accomplished, we all breathed easier because we knew he was not jerking us around. We could believe Captain America,   and that took the sting out of dropping a hard-to-come-by dime for his latest adventures.  

 

<p>Captain America was a uniquely American superhero, but never a mindless patriot.  He had fans in 75 countries, and his stories were told in numerous languages. Everybody, regardless of nationality, likes to see good triumph over evil. He defended freedom and liberty against those with evil intentions, and not all were foreigners. He understood that Americans have no monopoly on virtue. He would go after home-grown villains, even when they wrapped themselves in the flag. 

 

<p>It is doubtful that we could have survived the Cold War without Captain America. True, he was ably assisted by James Bond and a few others, but it was Captain America who deserves much of the credit. He fought an evil empire that enslaved millions, and he wanted those people to enjoy freedom and liberty too. He did more than Ronald Reagan to make that happen.

 

<p>Today there’s still a lot of talk about evil in the world and evil doers, sometimes from the strangest of places. But recognizing true evil requires going beyond rhetoric. It is then that things get murky, less black and white and more gray. We Americans are used to seeing ourselves as the good guys, but much of the world now regards our nation as a dangerous rogue state. This could not have pleased our hero.

 

<p>Captain America’s life must have been difficult these past few years. It is not hard to imagine him wondering if freedom and liberty grow out of the barrel of a gun. He never wavered in resisting evil. Still, he probably asked himself if good guys start unnecessary wars, or if it’s okay to drop bombs on women and children. I don’t remember Captain America ever dismissing civilian casualties as collateral damage, and I know he did not use torture. Rather, he made life miserable for those who resorted to such methods.

 

<p>I don’t recall Captain America ever saying he would use any means necessary to bring down the bad guys. He was too smart to fall into the trap of becoming like the evil enemy he was fighting. Had he done that, he would have lost his purpose in life and disappointed everyone who counted on him to help preserve real American values. 

 

<p>So Captain America is dead, and we are left on our own to fight our battles. But who’s the most dangerous enemy today? Pogo said years back that the enemy is us. Maybe he was right more than we want to admit. Captain America would tell us not to let anyone, especially our leaders, do evil in our name. He would remind us that freedom and justice are always worth defending.  He would also tell us to measure the threats carefully, choose our battles wisely and remember that nobody likes a bully.
