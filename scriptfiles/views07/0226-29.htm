<p>The invasion-occupation of Iraq has been described as a classic case of
asymmetrical warfare. Unable to begin to match the modern land, aerial
and sea weaponry of the United States, the insurgents are fighting back
with roadside IEDs, rifles and grenades to sow chaos, death and
destruction. Many of these attacks have been in civilian marketplaces.
The casualties show the inability, or unwillingness, of the U.S. to keep
the peace and protect civilians, as required, by the way, under
international law. The carnage, in turn, is supposed to generate more
resistance to the U.S. occupation by the people of Iraq.

<p>The idea behind asymmetrical attacks is not to directly engage U.S.
forces because that truly would be a series of suicide missions. Almost
four years into the occupation, an ominous new phase is revealing itself
from the insurgents. They are concentrating on bringing down U.S.
helicopters - eight since January 20th, more than in all of 2006.
Military strategists say they are not surprised. The New York Times
reports that "the attackers used a variety of weapons, including
shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, heavy machine guns,
rocket-propelled grenades and unguided rockets that cannot be diverted
by the flares helicopters disperse to fool heat-seeking missiles."

<p>Now comes the move to chemical attacks - namely chlorine that is used to
decontaminate drinking water. Historically, armies fought with physics,
chemistry and, less frequently, biology. Moving toward chemistry, the
insurgents are opening up the possibility of megadisasters that are very
difficult to stop. Again, reports The Times, "the attacks seem to have
been poorly executed, burning the chemical agent rather than dispersing
it, but more sophisticated weapons involving chlorine could injure
hundreds and cause mass panic." Make that thousands. Sabotaging large
tank cars with chlorine could generate a deadly cloud that could cover
and devastate life over numerous square miles.

<p>Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman, said "The
enemy is adaptive. The enemy wants to win."

<p>Have you noticed how often the attackers escape with their weapons? How
often their weapons caches are not located or their transfers are not
interdicted. Welcome to asymmetrical warfare.

<p>More than a few military and national security officials in the Bush
regime have publicly stated that the U.S. military presence in Iraq is
fueling the insurgency and providing a magnet, and training ground, for
more violent people from inside Iraq and from other countries, including
Al Qaeda, to learn the skills of sabotage and terror. These Bush
advisors range from General Casey to former CIA director, Porter J. Goss
and former anti-terrorist White House advisor to Bush, Richard Clark.
These judgments are widespread. The muzzled U.S. Army opposed the
invasion from the beginning.

<p>Over two years ago, author David Halberstam compared the invasion of
Iraq to smacking a beehive. Every month more and more beehives are being
smacked and the stings are becoming more venomous.

<p>With nearly 70 percent of the American people against this draining and
bloody war, along with scores of prominent former high ranking military,
diplomats and national security officials, why is Bush so stubborn,
ignorant and intending to end his Administration on January 20, 2009
mired in the infamy of the Iraq quagmire? Madness, refusal to admit
mistakes and wrongdoing, and the willingness to violate domestic laws
and international treaties.

<p>Hold Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney to the rule of the U.S. Constitution.
Commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives. In the
meantime, the public should demand their resignation. Richard Nixon and
Spiro Agnew resigned for far less "high crimes and misdemeanors." What
is at stake here is the global position of the U.S.A. and its own
national security.
