<p>That's how food activists must feel at the end of a mixed year.

 

<p>They asked for an end to the intensive farming conditions that cause mad cow disease and researchers gave them--a prion free cow. 

<p>(The bad news? It's safe to make cows cannibals again. The good news? Ranchers can save money by "recycling" their dead.)

 

<p>They asked for an end to egg laying hens packed in overstuffed cages over ammonia reeking pits and researchers at the Dolly the sheep institute gave them--"designer hens" with synthetic substances in their eggs like interferon b-1a  and miR24. 

 

<p>("Hundreds of birds" will be bred from a single cock once the correct gene is in place says lead scientist Dr. Helen Sang who has "modified" over 500 birds so far).

 

<p>They asked for pigs that don't, as the Seattle Post Intelligencer Editorial Board put it, "Spend their entire lives ignorant of earth or straw or sunshine, crowded together beneath a metal roof standing on metal slats suspended over a septic tank" their tails docked with "no anesthetic," and researchers gave them a cloned, transgenic omega-3 pig for a trumped up omega-3 shortage.

 

<p>(People can "continue to eat their junk food," enthused one pro transgenic pig scientist. "You won't have to change your diet, but you will be getting what you need.")  

 

<p>They asked for an end to slaughterhouses where animals are butchered while still alive and dragged off "dead piles" to the kill floor and industry gave them--mobile abattoirs. Slaughterhouses that make "house calls," eliminating shipping costs and disease transfer. (Good news for Ted Turner: they're licensed for buffalo.)

 

<p>Not only do the technology "solutions" perpetuate the problems--a preslaughter treatment that neutralizes salmonella in the "fecal soup" chickens are dipped in; Good for the birds' (sic) health says Feedstuffs--public monies are funding the private ventures of food commercializers, patentors and profiteers, say activists.

 

<p>(Omega-3 pig development was funded by National Institutes of Health and US National Cancer Institute monies.)

 

<p>Still, awareness is growing. 

 

<p>The film version of Eric Schlosser's popular Fast Food Nation and deadly e Coli outbreaks in 2006 brought new awareness to, well, what else might be in the meat. 

 

<p>Communities are uniting against the pollution from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) also known as factory farms.  

 

<p>And even Illinois Senator and presidential candidate Barack Obama has said, "poor treatment of poultry by the food processing industry... must not be tolerated."

 

<p>Scientists too are speaking out like Autumn Fiester, Ph.D., Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics who says the omega-3 pig is "an obvious attempt to drum up a need that justifies the science."

 

<p>"We are altering the genome of an animal to enable consumers to continue with their self-destructive eating habits," Fiester writes in the December 2006 issue of Nature Biotechnology. "What does this say about us if that is reason enough to manipulate sentient life?"

 

<p>A good question with cloned milk shakes and hamburgers just around the corner.
