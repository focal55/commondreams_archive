<p>The timing was almost eerie.

<p> A state commission appointed to review New Jersey's capital punishment statute issues a report essentially calling the death penalty indecent and barbaric, just days after the Iraqis sent their former dictator to the gallows.

<p> Saddam Hussein, a merciless, sadistic tyrant, was executed on Saturday, having been found guilty of crimes against humanity for his premeditated 1982 attack against an Iraqi village that killed 148 - only one of a long list of crimes.

<p> To many, then, the penalty might seem fitting - a brutal end for a brutal man. Bill O'Reilly on Fox, for instance, said the execution allows the Iraqi government to show it is a "viable" one. It is good that "since the Iraqi justice system has condemned Hussein to death, the Iraqis themselves will execute him."

<p>  "And that's good because the people Saddam brutalized should take care of him," he said during his Dec. 29 Talking Points commentary. "Now, some people are objecting to Saddam's execution. I myself oppose capital punishment, but I also understand that in cases involving crimes against humanity - like this one - a statement has to be made to the world."

<p> But the statement Saddam's execution sent is one of revenge, not closure or justice, a message that left open the question of what kind of civil society might grow from the war.

<p>  Consider the current cycle of violence - a cycle in which Sunni attack is followed by Shiite response and Shiite attack followed by Sunni response. It is a cycle not only of violence, but of reprisal, retribution and vengeance.

<p>Just as important, human rights group and most European governments were critical of the trial, saying it was rife with procedural flaws and political interference. These are significant problems that should not be swept under the rug - not because Saddam may have been innocent of the crimes of which he'd been accused, but because allowing them to stand now taints the process in its infancy, leaving future trials at risk. The argument - made by none other than The Washington Post, an opponent of capital punishment - that any justice in contemporary Iraq is likely to be flawed, so flawed justice for Saddam is OK, is ethical relativism of the worst kind.

<p>  This brings me to the state commission's report, which offered eight findings and recommends that capital punishment be abolished in New Jersey. The findings should not be surprising. The commission said there is no evidence that the death penalty "rationally serves a legitimate penological intent"; it is more expensive than life in prison without parole; there is too much risk of "disproportionality in capital sentencing" or executing someone falsely accused; and there are better alternatives, including life imprison without parole.

<p> But the finding that spoke most loudly to me - especially given the timing - was that the death penalty was "inconsistent with evolving standards of decency" in New Jersey and elsewhere in the country.

<p> The report focuses on several recent trends, including recent court cases removing exempting certain classes of citizens from the death penalty, including juveniles and the mentally retarded, and that several states have moved to restrict or abolish capital punishment.

<p> This jibes with what has become an international consensus remarked upon by the U.S. Supreme Court when it banned the execution of those who were younger than 18 at the time of their crimes because of the "overwhelming weight of international opinion," among other issues.

<p>  The consensus that is building - however slowly - is that society cannot use the threat of death as punishment for killing, it cannot become the killer to combat the violence.

<p> More than 50 years ago, the French philosopher and author Albert Camus made a similar point, calling capital punishment "the most premeditated of murders, to which no criminal's deed, however calculated can be compared."

<p> Or as George Bernard Shaw wrote, "It is the deed that teaches, not the name we give it. Murder and capital punishment are not opposites that cancel one another, but similars that breed their kind."
