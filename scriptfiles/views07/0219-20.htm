<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>The Bush administration famously based its argument for  invading Iraq  on best-case assumptions: that we would be greeted as liberators; that a  capable democratic government would quickly emerge; that our military presence  would be modest and temporary; and that Iraqi oil revenues would pay for  everything. All these assumptions, of course, turned out to be wrong. <br>
                  <br>

Now, many of the same people who pushed for the invasion are  arguing for escalating our military involvement based on a worst-case  assumption: that if America leaves quickly, the Apocalypse will follow. &ldquo;How  would [advocates of withdrawal] respond to the eruption of full-blown civil war  in Iraq and the massive ethnic cleansing it would produce?&rdquo; write Robert Kagan  and William Kristol in the <em>Weekly Standard</em>. &ldquo;How would they respond to the  intervention of Iraq&rsquo;s neighbors, including Iran, Syria, and Turkey? And most  important, what would they propose to do if, as a result of our withdrawal and  the collapse of Iraq, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups managed to establish  a safe haven from which to launch attacks against the United States and its  allies?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Similar rhetoric has been a staple of President Bush&rsquo;s  recent speeches. If the United States &ldquo;fails&rdquo; in Iraq&mdash;his euphemism for  withdrawal&mdash;the president said in January, &ldquo;[r]adical Islamic extremists would  grow in strength and gain new recruits. They would be in a better position to  topple moderate governments, create chaos in the region, and use oil revenues  to fund their ambitions &hellip; Our enemies would have a safe haven from which to  plan and launch attacks on the American people.&rdquo;<br>

<br>
                  This kind of thinking is also accepted by a wide range of  liberal hawks and conservative realists who, whether or not they originally  supported the invasion, now argue that the United States must stay. It was  evident in the Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker and Lee Hamilton, which,  participants say, was alarmed by expert advice that withdrawal would produce  potentially catastrophic consequences. 
                    Even many antiwar liberals believe that  a quick pullout would cause a bloodbath. Some favor withdrawal anyway, to cut  our own losses. Others demur out of geostrategic concerns, a feeling of moral  obligation to the Iraqis, or the simple fear that Democrats will be blamed for  the ensuing chaos.<br>
                  <br>
                  But if it was foolish to accept the best-case assumptions  that led us to invade Iraq, it&rsquo;s also foolish not to question the worst-case  assumptions that undergird arguments for staying. Is it possible that a quick  withdrawal of U.S. forces will lead to a dramatic worsening of the situation?  Of course it is, just as it&rsquo;s possible that maintaining or escalating troops  there could fuel the unrest. But it&rsquo;s also worth considering the possibility  that the worst may not happen: What if the doomsayers are wrong?</p>
                  <p><strong>The al-Qaeda myth</strong> <br>
                    <br>

                    To understand why it&rsquo;s a mistake to assume the worst, let&rsquo;s  begin with the most persistent, Bush-fostered fear about post-occupation Iraq:  that al-Qaeda or other Islamic extremists will seize control once America  departs; or that al-Qaeda will establish a safe haven in a rump, lawless  Sunnistan and use that territory as a base, much as it used Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.<br>
                    <br>
                    The idea that al-Qaeda might take over Iraq is nonsensical.  Numerous estimates show that the group called Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and its  foreign fighters comprise only 5 to 10 percent of the Sunni insurgents&rsquo; forces.  Most Sunni insurgents are simply what Wayne White&mdash;who led the State  Department&rsquo;s intelligence effort on Iraq until 2005&mdash;calls POIs, or &ldquo;pissed-off  Iraqis,&rdquo; who are fighting because &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t like the occupation.&rdquo; But the  foreign terrorist threat is frequently advanced by the Bush administration,  often with an even more alarming variant&mdash;that al-Qaeda will use Iraq as a  headquarters for the establishment of a global caliphate. In December 2005,  Rear Admiral William D. Sullivan, vice director for strategic plans and policy  within the Joint Chiefs of Staff, delivered a briefing in which he warned that  al-Qaeda hoped to &ldquo;revive the caliphate,&rdquo; with its capital in Baghdad.  President Bush himself has warned darkly that after controlling Iraq, Islamic  militants will &ldquo;establish a 
                    radical Islamic empire that spans from Spain  to Indonesia.&rdquo;<br>

                    <br>
                    The reality is far different. Even if AQI came to dominate  the Sunni resistance, it would be utterly incapable of seizing Baghdad against  the combined muscle of the Kurds and the Shiites, who make up four fifths of  the country. (The Shiites, in particular, would see the battle against the  Sunni extremist AQI&mdash;which regards the Shiites as a heretical, non-Muslim  sect&mdash;as a life-or-death struggle.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Nor is it likely that AQI would ever be allowed to use the  Sunni areas of Iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on foreign targets.  In Afghanistan, al-Qaeda had a full-fledged partnership with the Taliban and  helped finance the state. In Iraq, the secular Baathists and former Iraqi  military officers who lead the main force of the resistance despise AQI, and  many of the Sunni tribes in western Iraq are closely tied to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s  royal family, which is bitterly opposed to al-Qaeda. AQI has, at best, a  marriage of convenience with the rest of the Sunni-led resistance. 
                    Over the  past two years, al-Qaeda-linked forces in Iraq have often waged pitched battles  with the mainstream Iraqi resistance and Sunni tribal forces. Were U.S. troops  to leave Iraq today, the Baathists, the military, and the tribal leaders would  likely join forces to exterminate AQI in short order.<br>
                    <br>
                  It&rsquo;s also worth questioning whether the forces that call  themselves Al Qaeda in Iraq have any real ties to whatever remains of Osama bin  Laden&rsquo;s weakened, Pakistan-based leadership. Such ties, if they exist, have  always been murky at best, even under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.  With al-Zarqawi&rsquo;s elimination in 2006 and his replacement by a collegial group,  these ties are even muddier. Although it&rsquo;s convenient for the Bush  administration to claim that al-Qaeda is a Comintern-like international force,  it is really a loose ideological movement, and its Iraq component is fed  largely by jihadists who flock to the country because they see the war as a  holy cause. Once the United States withdraws, Iraq will no longer be a magnet  for that jihad.</p>

                  <p><strong>The Sunni-Shiite civil war</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    The doomsayers&rsquo; second great fear is that the Sunni-Shiite  sectarian civil war could escalate further, reaching near-genocidal levels and  sucking in Iraq&rsquo;s neighbors. &ldquo;The biggest danger as we draw down is that the  Shiites will run roughshod over the Sunnis,&rdquo; says Brian Katulis of the Center  for American Progress, whose exit strategy, &ldquo;Strategic Redeployment 2.0,&rdquo; <br>

                    is a blueprint for many Democrats on Capitol Hill.  Similarly, Wayne White, who advised the Baker-Hamilton ISG, says that because  of Baghdad&rsquo;s importance, both Sunni and Shiite forces would probably rush to  fill a vacuum in the capital if the United States withdraws.<br>
                    <br>
                    In fact, it&rsquo;s hard to find an analysis of the Iraq crisis  that doesn&rsquo;t predict an expanded Sunni-Shiite war once the United States  departs. But let&rsquo;s look at the countervailing factors&mdash;and there are many.<br>
                    <br>
                    First, the United States is doing little, if anything, to  restrain ethnic cleansing, either in Baghdad neighborhoods or Sunni and Shiite  enclaves surrounding the capital. Indeed, under its current policy, the United  States is arming and training one side in a civil war by bolstering the  Shiite-controlled army and police. <br>

                    <br>
                    In theory, Baghdad is roughly divided into Shiite east Baghdad  on one side of the Tigris River, and Sunni west Baghdad on the other side. But  in isolated neighborhoods such as Adhamiya, a Sunni part of east Baghdad, and  Kadhimiya, a Shiite enclave in west Baghdad, ugly ethnic cleansing is  proceeding apace. The same is true along a necklace of Sunni towns south of the  capital, in an area that is predominantly Shiite; in mixed Sunni-Shiite towns  such as Samarra, the largest city of predominantly Sunni Salahuddin Province,  north of Baghdad; and in Diyala Province, northeast of Baghdad. In these areas,  it is facile to assert that U.S. troops are restraining the death squads and  religiously inspired killers on both sides. And it would be impossible for us  to do so even with a much greater increase in American troops than the  president has called for.<br>
                    <br>
                    Second, although battle lines are hardening and militias on  both sides are becoming self-sustaining, the civil war is limited by physical  constraints. Neither the Sunnis nor the Shiites have much in the way of armor  or heavy weapons&mdash;tanks, major artillery, helicopters, and the like. Without  heavy weaponry, neither side can take the war deep into the other&rsquo;s territory.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not good on offense,&rdquo; says Warren Marik, a retired CIA officer who  worked in Iraq in the 1990s. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t assault positions.&rdquo; Shiites may have  numbers on their side. But because the Sunnis have most of Iraq&rsquo;s former army  officers, and their resistance militia boasts thousands of highly trained  soldiers, they&rsquo;re unlikely <br>

                    to be overrun by the Shiite majority. Equally, the minority  Sunnis won&rsquo;t be able to seize Shiite parts of Baghdad or major Shiite cities in  the south. 
                    Presuming neither side gets its hands on heavy weapons, once you  take U.S. forces out of the equation the Sunnis and Shiites would ultimately  reach an impasse. <br>
                    <br>
                    Even if post-occupation efforts to create a new political  compact among Iraqis fail, the most likely outcome is, again, a bloody  Sunni-Shiite stalemate, accompanied by continued ethnic cleansing in mixed  areas. But that, of course, is no worse than the path Iraq is already on under  U.S. occupation. <br>
                    <br>
                    A third fear is that Iraq&rsquo;s neighbors will support their  proxies in this fight. Indeed, they probably will&mdash;but within limits. Iran,  which is already assisting various Shiite parties (especially the Supreme  Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq), would continue to do so. And Sunni  Arab states like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan would line up behind Iraq&rsquo;s  Sunnis. Even so, neither Shiite Iran nor the Sunni Arab countries would likely risk  a regional conflagration by providing their Iraqi proxies with the heavy  weapons that would enable them to wage offensive operations in each other&rsquo;s  heartland.<br>

                    <br>
                    The only power that could qualitatively worsen Iraq&rsquo;s  sectarian civil war is the United States. Washington continues to arm and train  the Shiites, although so far it has resisted Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&rsquo;s  pleas to provide Iraq&rsquo;s Shiite-led army and police with heavy weapons, armor,  and an air force. Only if that policy changed, and the United States began to  create a true Shiite army in Iraq, would the Sunni Arab states likely feel  compelled to build up Iraq&rsquo;s Sunni paramilitary militias into something  resembling a traditional army. <br>
                    <br>
                  Thus, even if we assume that Iraq&rsquo;s parties cannot achieve  some sort of reconciliation as the United States withdraws, an American pullout  is hardly guaranteed to unleash unbridled chaos. On the contrary, each year  since 2003 that American troops have remained in Iraq, the violence has  escalated steadily. </p>
                  <p><strong>A Kurdish power grab?</strong> <br>

                    <br>
                    The third major concern about a post-occupation  Iraq&mdash;although it gets less attention than it deserves&mdash;is the possibility of a  crisis triggered by a Kurdish power grab in Kirkuk, the city at the heart of  Iraq&rsquo;s northern oil fields. Since 2003, the Kurds have been waging a  systematic, ugly round of ethnic cleansing, packing Kirkuk with Kurds,  kidnapping or driving out Arab residents (many of them settled there by  Saddam), and stacking the city council with Kurdish partisans.<br>
                    <br>
                    Though Kurdish Iraq is mostly quiet and relatively  prosperous under the Kurdistan Regional Government that controls three  northeastern provinces, the Kurds may be tempted to expand their territory and  secede from Iraq. Under the occupation-imposed constitution, the Kurds have the  right to hold a referendum in Kirkuk later this year that would probably put  that oil-rich area under the control of the KRG; the Baker-Hamilton ISG called  the referendum &ldquo;explosive&rdquo; and recommended that it be postponed. Alternatively,  the Kurds might opt to take advantage of the Sunni-Shiite civil war to seize  Kirkuk by force. Either way, most Kurds know that a Kurdish-controlled Kirkuk  is an essential precondition for their ultimate independence from Iraq. <br>
                    <br>

                    It&rsquo;s hard to exaggerate the dangers inherent in a Kurdish  grab for Kirkuk. Such a move would inflame Iraq&rsquo;s Arab population (both Sunnis  and Shiites), impinge on other minorities (including Turkmen and Christians),  and provoke an outburst of ethnic cleansing in the city. Iraq&rsquo;s two-sided civil  war would become a three-sided affair.<br>
                    <br>
                    But although this scenario sounds alarming, the reality is  that, in the event of an American withdrawal, the Kurds would find it  exceedingly difficult either to take Kirkuk or to declare independence. An  independent Kurdistan would 
                    be landlocked, surrounded by hostile nations, and would  possess a weak paramilitary army incapable of matching Iran,  Arab Iraq, or Turkey.  If Kurdistan were to secede without gaining Kirkuk&rsquo;s oil, it would not be an  economically viable nation. Even with the oil, the Kurds would have to depend  on pipelines through Iraq and Turkey to export any significant amount. Nor  would Turkey, with its large Kurdish minority, stand for a breakaway Kurdish  state, and the Kurds know that the Turkish armed forces would overwhelm them.<br>
                    <br>
                    Conversely, under the U.S. occupation&mdash;or, 
                    perhaps, because of it&mdash;the Kurds apparently feel emboldened  to press their advantage in Kirkuk,  despite the dire consequences. And if the United States were to adopt the idea  floated by some in Washington of building permanent bases in Kurdistan, it  would embolden the Kurds further. (The threat of a Turkish invasion is the  chief deterrent to any move by the Kurds against Kirkuk, but as long 
                  as the United States  maintains a presence in Kurdistan, the Turks will be  reluctant to check the Kurds, for fear of running into U.S.  troops.) Thus, by staying or by creating bases in Kurdistan, the United States  is more likely to foster a Kurdish-Arab civil war in Iraq.</p>

                  <p><strong>Will the center hold?</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Not only is the worst-case scenario far from a sure thing in  the event of an American withdrawal, but there is also a best-case scenario.  Precisely because the idea of all-out civil war and a regional blowup involving  Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey is so horrifying, all the political forces  inside and outside Iraq have many incentives not to go there.<br>
                    <br>
                    Certainly, four years into the war, passions on all sides  have been inflamed, communal tensions bared, and the secular, urban Iraqi  middle class has either fled or been decimated. The mass terror perpetuated by  armed gangs of extremists now occupies center stage. The broken Iraqi state has  ceased to exist outside the Green Zone, the economy is devastated, and  unemployment is believed to be hovering around 50 percent.<br>
                    <br>
                    Yet the neoconservatives and the Bush administration weren&rsquo;t  entirely wrong in 2003 when they expressed confidence in the underlying  strength of the Iraqi body politic. Though things have gone horrendously awry,  there are many factors that could provide the glue to put Humpty Dumpty back  together again.<br>

                    <br>
                    Contrary to the conventional wisdom in Washington, Iraq is  not a make-believe state cobbled together after World War I, but a nation  united by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, just as the Nile unites Egypt.  Historically, the vast majority of Iraqis have not primarily identified  themselves according to their sect, as Sunnis or Shiites. Of course, as the  civil war escalates, more Iraqis are identifying by sect, and tensions are  worsening. 
                    But it is not too late to resurrect some of the comity that once  existed. 
                    The current war is not a conflict between all Sunnis and all Shiites,  but a violent clash of extremist paramilitary armies. Most Iraqis do not  support the extremists on either side. According to a poll conducted in June  2006 by the International Republican Institute, &ldquo;seventy-eight per cent of  Iraqis, including a majority of Shiites, opposed the division of Iraq along  ethnic and sectarian lines.&rdquo;<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, the country&rsquo;s vast oil reserves, conceivably the  world&rsquo;s largest, could help hold Iraq together. Iraqi politicians are currently  devising a law that would ratify the central government&rsquo;s control of all of the  country&rsquo;s oil wealth. Even the corruption that now cripples Iraq tethers Iraqi  political leaders to the 
                    central government and to the idea of Iraq  as a nation-state. &ldquo;None of the big players really want civil war,&rdquo; says an  Iraqi military official closely affiliated with Ahmad Chalabi&rsquo;s Iraqi National  Congress. &ldquo;None of them want to give up the regular flow of funds that they get  now from corruption.&rdquo;<br>

                    <br>
                    What most Iraqis do seem to want, according to numerous  polls, is for American forces to leave. Even within the current, skewed Iraqi  political system, a majority of Iraq&rsquo;s parliament supports a U.S. withdrawal.  If we add to the mix the powerful Sunni-led resistance, including former  Baathists, Sunni nationalists, and tribes, an overwhelming majority wants to  end the occupation. <br>
                    <br>
                    This shared desire could be another crucial force in helping  maintain the integrity of Iraq. The catch-22 of Iraqi politics is that any  Iraqi government created or supported by the United States is instantly suspect  in Iraqi eyes. By the same token, a nationalist government that succeeds in  ushering U.S. forces out of Iraq would have overwhelming support from most  Iraqis on most sides of the conflict. With that support, such a government  might be able to make the difficult compromises&mdash;like amending the constitution  to give minority protections to Sunnis&mdash;that the Maliki government has been  unable or unwilling to make but that most observers believe are crucial to any  political settlement that might end the fighting.<br>
                    <br>
                  It is clear that there are many features of Iraq&rsquo;s current  landscape that lend themselves to the eventual creation of a stable, postwar  nation&mdash;although rebuilding the country will take generations. It is, at this  point, the best we can hope for. Like all best-case scenarios, it might or  might not happen. But the very same can be said of the worst-case scenario&mdash;a  scenario that war hawks portray as a certainty and wave, like a bloody shirt,  to scare decision-makers and members of Congress into supporting a failed  strategy.</p>
