<p>While congressional Democrats test how far they should go in  challenging George W. Bush&rsquo;s war powers, the time may be running out to stop  Bush from ordering a major escalation of the Middle East  conflict by attacking Iran.</strong></span></p>
<p>Military and intelligence sources continue to tell me that  preparations are advancing for a war with Iran  starting possibly as early as mid-to-late February. The sources offer some  differences of opinion over whether Bush might cite a provocation from Iran  or whether Israel  will take the lead in launching air strikes against Iran&rsquo;s  nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>But there is growing alarm among military and intelligence experts  that Bush already has decided to attack and simply is waiting for a second  aircraft carrier strike force to arrive in the region &ndash; and for a propaganda  blitz to stir up some pro-war sentiment at home.</p>

<p>One well-informed U.S.  military source called me in a fury after consulting with  Pentagon associates and discovering  how far along the war preparations are. He said the plans call for extensive  aerial attacks on Iran,  including use of powerful bunker-busting ordnance.</p>
<p>Another source with a pipeline into Israeli thinking said  the Iran war  plan has expanded over the past several weeks. Earlier thinking had been that  Israeli warplanes would hit Iranian nuclear targets with U.S.  forces in reserve in case of Iranian retaliation, but now the strategy anticipates  a major U.S.  military follow-up to an Israeli attack, the source said.</p>
<p>Both sources used the same word &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in describing the  plan to expand the war to Iran.  The two sources, like others I have interviewed, said that attacking Iran  could touch off a regional &ndash; and possibly global &ndash; conflagration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be like the TV show &lsquo;24&rsquo;,&rdquo; the American military  source said, citing the likelihood of Islamic retaliation reaching directly into  the United States.</p>

<p>Though Bush insists that no decision has been made on  attacking Iran,  he offered similar assurances of his commitment to peace in the months before  invading Iraq  in 2003. Yet leaked documents from London  made clear that he had set a course for war  nine months to a year  before the Iraq  invasion.</p>
<p>In other words, Bush&rsquo;s statements that he has no plans to &quot;invade&quot; Iran and that he&rsquo;s still committed  to settle differences with Iran  over its nuclear program diplomatically should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the possibility that the war  preparations are a game of chicken to pressure Iran  to accept outside controls on its nuclear program and to trim back its regional  ambitions. But sometimes such high-stakes gambles lead to miscalculations or  set in motion  dynamics that can't be controlled.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;You Will Die&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Iraq  is seen as another factor pressing on Bush to act quickly against Iran.</p>
<p>Other sources with first-hand knowledge of conditions in Iraq  have told me that the U.S.  position is even more precarious than generally understood. Westerners can&rsquo;t  even move around Baghdad and many other Iraqi  cities except in armed convoys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In some countries, if you want to get out of the car and go  to the market, they&rsquo;ll tell you that it might be dangerous,&rdquo; one experienced  American cameraman told me. &ldquo;In Iraq,  you will be killed. Not that you might be killed, but you will be killed. The  first Iraqi with a gun will shoot you, and if no one has a gun, they&rsquo;ll stone  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While U.S.  war correspondents in most countries travel around in taxis with &ldquo;TV&rdquo; taped to  their windows, Western journalists in Iraq  move only in armed convoys to and from specific destinations. They operate from  heavily guarded Baghdad hotels  sometimes with single families responsible for security since outsiders can't  be trusted.</p>
<p>The American cameraman said one European journalist rebelled  at the confinement, took off on her own in a cab &ndash; and was never seen again.</p>
<p>Depression also is spreading among U.S.  intelligence officials who monitor covert operations in Iraq  from listening stations sometimes thousands of miles away. The results of these  Special Forces operations have been so horrendous that morale in the  intelligence community has suffered.</p>

<p>The futility of the Iraq War also is  contributing to professional cynicism. Some intelligence support personnel are  volunteering for Iraq  duty not because they think they can help win the war but because the hazard  pay is high and life in the protected Green Zone is relatively safe and easy.</p>
<p>Once getting past the risks of the Baghdad airport and the dangerous  road into the city, U.S. civilian government personnel ensconce themselves in the  Green Zone, which amounts to a bubble of U.S. creature comforts &ndash; from  hamburgers to lounging by the pool &ndash; separate from the world of average Iraqis  who are mostly barred.</p>
<p>Cooks are brought in from other countries out of the  unstated concern that Iraqis might poison the food. </p>
<p>That American officials have come to view a posting in Iraq  as a pleasant career enhancer &ndash; rather than a vital national security mission  for the United States  &ndash; is another sign that the war is almost certainly beyond recovery.</p>
<p>Another experienced observer of conflicts around the world  told me that  Bush&rsquo;s new idea of putting small numbers of U.S.  troops among Iraqi government forces inside police stations represents an act  of idiocy that is sure to get Americans killed.</p>

<p>Conditions in Iraq  have so deteriorated &ndash; and animosity toward Americans has so metastasized &ndash; that  traditional counterinsurgency strategies are hard to envision, too.</p>
<p>Normally, winning the hearts and minds of a target  population requires a commitment to move among the people and work on public  action projects, from building roads to improving the judicial system. But all that  requires some measure of political goodwill and personal trust.</p>
<p>Given the nearly four years of U.S. occupation and the  devastation that Iraq has suffered, not even the most talented American counterinsurgency  specialists can expect to overcome the hatred swelling among  large segments of Iraqi  society.</p>
<p>Bush&rsquo;s &ldquo;surge&rdquo; strategy of conducting more military sweeps  through more Iraqi neighborhoods &ndash; knocking down doors, gunning down hostile  Iraqis and dragging off others to detention camps &ndash; is not likely to assuage   hard feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Wider War</strong></p>
<p>So, facing slim odds in Iraq,  Bush is tempted by the allure of escalation, a chance to blame the Iranians for  his Iraq  failure and to punish them with air strikes. He might see that as a way to buy  time, a chance to rally his pro-war supporters and a strategy for enhancing his  presidential legacy.</p>
<p>But the consequences both internationally and domestically &ndash;  from possible disruption of oil supplies to potential retaliation from Islamic terrorists &ndash; could be  devastating. </p>
<p>Yet, there is a sense of futility among many in Washington who  doubt they can do anything to stop Bush. So far, the Democratic-controlled  Congress has lagged behind the curve, debating how to phrase a non-binding  resolution of disapproval about Bush&rsquo;s &ldquo;surge&rdquo; of 21,500 troops in Iraq,  while Bush may be opening an entirely new front in Iran.</p>
<p>According to intelligence sources, Bush&rsquo;s Iran  strategy is expected to let the Israelis take a lead role in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities in order to defuse Democratic opposition and let the U.S.  intervention be sold as  defensive, a case of a vulnerable ally  protecting itself from a future nuclear threat.</p>

<p>Once American air and naval forces are committed to a new  conflict, the Democrats will find it politically difficult to interfere at  least in the near future, the thinking goes. A violent reaction from the Islamic  world would further polarize the American population and let Bush paint war  critics as cowardly, disloyal or pro-terrorist.</p>
<p>As risky as a wider war might be, Bush&rsquo;s end game would  dominate the final two years of his presidency as he forces both Republican and  Democratic candidates to address issues of war and peace on his terms.</p>
<p>On Jan. 10, the night of Bush&rsquo;s national address on the Iraq  War, NBC Washington bureau chief Tim Russert made a striking observation about  a pre-speech briefing that Bush and other senior administration officials gave to news  executives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strong sense in the upper echelons of the White  House that Iran is going to surface relatively quickly as a major issue in the  country and the world in a very acute way &ndash; and a prediction that in 2008  candidates of both parties will have as a fundamental campaign promise or  premise a policy to deal with Iran and not let it go nuclear,&rdquo; Russert said.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how significant Iran  was today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, Bush and his top advisers not only signaled their  expectation of a &ldquo;very acute&rdquo; development with Iran but that the Iranian issue  would come to dominate Campaign 2008 with candidates forced to spell out plans for  containing this enemy state.</p>
<p><strong>What to Do?</strong></p>
<p>The immediate question, however, is what, if anything, can  Congress and the American people do to head off Bush&rsquo;s expanded war strategy.</p>
<p>Some in Congress have called on Bush to seek prior  congressional approval before entering a war with Iran.  Others, such as Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pennsylvania, have asked Bush to spell  out how expansive he thinks his war powers are.</p>
<p>&quot;I would suggest respectfully to the President that he  is not the sole decider,&quot; Specter said during a  Senate hearing on war  powers on Jan. 30. &quot;The decider is a shared and joint responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p>But Bush and his neoconservative legal advisers have made  clear that they see virtually no limits to Bush's &quot;plenary&quot; powers as  Commander in Chief at a time of war. In their view, Bush is free to take  military actions abroad and to waive legal and constitutional constraints at  home because the United States  has been deemed part of the &quot;battlefield.&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing short of a direct congressional prohibition on war  with Iran and a serious threat of impeachment would seem likely to give Bush  more than a moment&rsquo;s pause. But congressional Republicans would surely obstruct  such measures and Bush might well veto any law that was  passed.</p>
<p>Still, unless Congress escalates the confrontation with the  President &ndash; and does so quickly &ndash; it may be too late to stop what could become a  very dangerous escalation.</p>
