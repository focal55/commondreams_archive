<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>  Commenting on the execution of Saddam Hussein, President Bush asserted that it was a warning that no man can escape accountability for his crimes.</div>

<p>There is no longer any confusion from any quarter that the 3,000 deaths and 20,000 gruesome American casualties, the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths, the atrocious, hellish daily existence of the Iraqi people, and the gluttonous economic waste of the invasion and occupation of Iraq are the direct results of the calculated actions of the president and his administration and the astonishing silence and acceptance of the Congress.</div>

<p>The relentless slaughter and waste in Iraq was and continues to be orchestrated by the president and his administration. It is right for them to be held accountable for crimes against humanity.</div>

<p>The Congress has one last chance to avoid complicity in these crimes. Our politicians must understand that there are penalties for ignoring the clear direction provided by the 2006 election and the consistent, long-standing positions of all opinion polls calling for a withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.</div>

<p>America's government cannot continue to unilaterally wage preemptive war around the globe without the harsh price of moral and economic bankruptcy being paid by American citizens. Instead, enlightened, honest leaders must rise up and guide America back to sanity, stability, and sustainability.</div>

<p>Then and only then will we be able to confront the real villains in the world: human-induced poverty, inequality, exploitation, endless war and the degradation of the planet.</div>

<p>Congress has failed to demonstrate the resolve that was so recently mandated. Therefore, in such a vacuum, it is proper for the people to directly show the way to an evasive Congress. Empty congressional rhetoric has been cheap and plentiful while thoughtful congressional action has been rare.</div>

<p>Accountability is in order, as the president so ironically asserted. The grounds for impeachment include waging a "war of aggression" against civilians; violating human rights under international law; and violating the constitutional rights of American citizens.</div>

<p>Therefore, it is right and proper to impeach the President and many of his key staff. </div>

<p>The first steps toward impeachment are already being taken in Maine on a Web site titled www.maineimpeach.org that is being replicated in a number of other states. Signatures are now being collected on such Web sites.</div>

<p>There are many citizens who have expressed the fear that the formal channels of redress in America are not ensuring justice. Arising out of those concerns, there are plans for demonstrations, marches, public gatherings and even nonviolent civil disobedience that were so effective during the civil rights and Vietnam War periods.</div>

<p>These movements are growing out of frustration and impatience waiting for government leaders to act. These efforts can be monitored on various peace Web sites such as www.everyvillage-me.us and similar sites. They are operating in plain sight.</div>

<p>The signs are clearer than they have been since the invasion of Iraq that Americans agree with President Bush that no man can escape accountability. It is also clear that many of us are willing to start the process of accountability, with or without Congress.</div>

<p>For those of us who have had family and friends in military service in Iraq who have been used, abused and abandoned by the corrupt policies of politicians and the calculating negligence of the Pentagon, accountability is essential. The continuation of such horror and inhumanity by America is simply not acceptable.</div>

<p>There will be no replay of 2006 in 2008.</div>
