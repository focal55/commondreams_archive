<p>In his Oscar-winning movie, "An Inconvenient Truth," Al 
Gore insists that climate change is a moral problem. The former vice president 
doesn't develop the thought, but surely an adequate U.S. response cannot occur 
until Americans understand and take up their ethical obligations relative to 
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>At first glance, this might sound outlandish. How can we worry about 
ethical behavior, as if this country were a person with a soul, in a world of 
nations where the first rule is everyone for himself?</p>

<p>History shows us morality does have a role to play in affairs among 
nations. But there are good, practical reasons why, in this situation, ethical 
behavior is in America's best interest.</p>

<p>Now that we understand the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate 
change worldwide, nations like the United States that historically have pumped 
out the most toxins must take a stance. If we do not commit to a just solution 
- meaning a larger reduction in emissions from this country than any other, 
since we have been the leading polluter - the rest of the world will not likely
 agree to action it needs to take.</p>

<p>If the United States does not act equitably, we cannot expect rapidly 
developing nations like China and India, whose emissions will rise dramatically
 if they do not adopt more sustainable development policies, to carry their 
weight, either.</p>

<p>In the short run, every nation will take an economic hit to cooperate. The 
United States, which should be able to adapt relatively painlessly compared to 
nations with much smaller and less diverse economies, has a perfect opportunity
 to be a moral exemplar.</p>

<p>The most frequently cited arguments against taking action - scientific 
uncertainty and the cost to the U.S. economy - are ethically flawed. There is 
enough scientific agreement for us to know great harm from climate change 
likely will be experienced before the remaining scientific uncertainties can be
 resolved, and the longer we wait to take action, the more difficult it will be
 to stabilize greenhouse gases at safe levels.</p>

<p>The economic-cost arguments are morally selfish, in that they fail to take 
into account the enormous harm to others around the world that will occur if 
greenhouse gases are allowed to continue to rise.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that nations will limit greenhouse emissions on the 
basis of fairness, but there are several reasons to think they will. In 1992, 
the United States, along with more than 160 other nations, signed the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In this international treaty, 
nations already agreed to reduce emissions based on "equity" to prevent 
dangerous climate change.</p>

<p>Also, in a number of successful multilateral treaties, nations have agreed 
to divide obligations in regard to natural resources on the basis of fair 
allocation. These include numerous treaties establishing targets to reduce 
fishing to prevent collapse of threatened species and multination agreements on
 sharing water resources.</p>

<p>The question of when or whether a nation should act morally has long been 
debated in political theory. Those often called realists advise nations to act 
only in their own interest, warning that those acting on the basis of morality 
alone will be punished by an international system in which self-interest rules.</p>

<p>Yet, even they recognize nations do well to act justly when they need 
cooperation of others to solve a common threat. Climate change may be the best 
example of such a problem.</p>

<p>According to the authors of a "White Paper on the Ethical Dimensions of 
Climate Change" released at UN climate change talks in Nairobi, Kenya, in 
November - and these include ethicists, scientists, economists, legal experts, 
philosophers and negotiators from Asia, Europe, South America and the United 
States - climate change raises the most profound ethical concerns, literally 
issues of life and death.</p>

<p>Unless people see their moral obligations, they will not likely do what is 
needed to protect those most vulnerable, which include some of the world's 
poorest people in sub-Sahara Africa and Southern Asia. Some small island states
 in the Pacific face extinction from rising seas.</p>

<p>
The scientific and economic facts about climate change must be considered 
in formulating national policy, but only express ethical reflection can lead to
 a just global response.
