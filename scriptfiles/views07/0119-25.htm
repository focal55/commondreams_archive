In 2005, former U.S. Sen. John Edwards said about his vote for war in 
Iraq: "I was wrong [and] I take responsibility."  
<P>This statement, so simple, has been all too rare from politicians and 
leading media voices. Instead, as the war rages on  --  a war itself originally 
based on lies  --  our political arena still teems with icons more interested 
in hiding the truth. That's no small matter. As the saying goes, the first step 
to recovery is admitting the problem. Sadly, though, the flip side is also true 
--  refusing to admit a problem will perpetuate that problem indefinitely.  
<P>President Bush said just two months ago that "we've never been for stay 
the course." This, when for the last three years he has batted down any 
questions about his Iraq policy by saying "stay the course."  
<P>Similarly, consider U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (Independent-Conn.). Facing 
a difficult Democratic primary challenge, Lieberman said of Iraq in July that 
"the sooner we are out the better," and that, by the end of 2006, he would 
support efforts to "begin to draw down significant numbers of American troops." 
He later said that "no one wants to end the war in Iraq more than I do and 
bring our troops home." But weeks after being re-elected, Lieberman is now 
leading the charge for military escalation, sending a letter to President Bush 
last week saying, "[I] strongly encourage you to send additional American 
troops to Iraq." 
<P>Pundits and news analysts are employed to expose this sort of nonsense so 
that our democratic discourse  --  and the policy choices that come out of it  
--  are grounded in fact. But that has not happened. Instead, we have seen a 
furious stampede by the most prominent media figures to cover their own hides 
with either more lies, or more out-of-the mainstream bluster. 
<P>Time Magazine's Joe Klein, for instance, last week claimed he has "been 
opposed to the Iraq war ever since 2002." Readers were expected to forget about 
his nationally televised declaration in late February 2003  --  the critical 
days just before the invasion was ordered.  
<P>"War may well be the right decision at this point," Klein told NBC's Tim 
Russert. "In fact, I think it probably is." 
<P>This followed venerated New York Times columnist David Brooks who, rather 
than admitting the failure of his Iraq war cheerleading, lashed out at  
anti-war challenges to pro-war incumbents, writing that "primary voters 
shouldn't be allowed to define the choices in American politics" (apparently, 
democracy and elections are no longer an acceptable way to run our country). 
Weeks later, the Washington Post's Richard Cohen justified his support for the 
war by flippantly writing that he thinks "the prudent use of violence could be 
therapeutic."  
<P>All of this might be fine if those spewing this rhetoric faced some form 
of public rebuke that made clear such behavior is objectionable. But there has 
been nothing of the kind.  

<P>The president was barely bothered by reporters about why he denied he ever 
said "stay the course." Lieberman continues to be invited on Sunday talk shows 
as a credible guest discussing Iraq, and no one asks him about his hypocrisy. 
Meanwhile, Klein, Brooks and Cohen are still prominent news analysts for the 
largest publications in America, playing key roles shaping a political debate 
they now distort. 
<P>In other words, all of this is accepted without question, as if such 
behavior should be treated like just another staple of American politics.  
<P>Of course, dishonesty and anti-democratic salvos and caustic statements 
about violence are not new in politics  --  but the ho-hum reaction to it is. 
And that should trouble anyone interested in making sure America never again 
embarks on another misguided military adventure that leaves thousands dead and 
our national security in tatters.  
<P>How can we expect to change course in Iraq, if a president is given a pass 
to claim he has never stayed the course in the first place? How can we expect 
to hold lawmakers accountable if they are never questioned about their efforts 
to deliberately mislead us? How can we expect the media to be a watchdog if its 
leading analysts and news framers face no public sanctions when they disrespect 
the truth or give credence to fringe ideologies? 
<P>A country whose national political conversation is dominated by voices 
that deny their own complicity in national security tragedies; downplay human 
casualties, and generally make dishonesty mundane, is a nation prevented from 
reflecting on its bad decisions  --  and thus is doomed to repeat such bad 
decisions in the future.
