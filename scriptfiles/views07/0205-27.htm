<p>It's been more than five years since the September 11
attacks.  In many ways, daily life in the United
States has returned to normal.  Of course, we hear
about the horrific toll in far-off places-Iraq,
Afghanistan.  We know that American soldiers, as well
as vaguely identified "insurgents", and, of course,
ordinary Iraqi and Afghan civilians, are dying every
day.  But in American cities, children go to school,
people go to work and, thankfully, life goes on.

<p>Last week, a bizarre ad campaign gone wrong reminded
us that we still live life subject to a hair trigger. 
Authorities in Boston mistook electronic light boards advertising a cartoon TV show for bombs.  Fortunately, there was no real danger in Boston.  But the scare is a reminder that we may have to deal with a real threat in the future-and that we are still very much on edge.
 

<p>I certainly and fervently hope there are no future
attacks to deal with.  It feels faintly blasphemous
even to think, let alone write, about such things. 
However, it is important to consider this possibility
during a moment of relative calm.

<p>How would we react if there is another attack? 
Certainly, there would be sorrow, fear, outrage.  How
would our government react?  It would likely depend on
the circumstances, but there is reason to be concerned
about a draconian crackdown on freedom.  Whether it is
making decisions about war abroad, issuing "signing
statements" that purport to limit the meaning of laws
passed by Congress, or authorizing warrantless
surveillance in the face of the contrary authority of
federal law, the Bush administration has made clear
that it sees presidential power as nearly unbounded.

<p>Everyone wants security.  The question is-at what
price?  Can we trust this administration to respect
the Constitution and the rule of law?  Can we trust it
to respond to a real enemy rather than initiating
reprisals against exaggerated foes?  Can we trust it
to devise an effective response to an attack?

<p>The answer suggested by Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, a
war in Iraq launched on misinformation if not outright
lies, and warrantless surveillance ordered in defiance
of the FISA is troubling, to say the least.

<p>President Bush has often said that "everything
changed" after September 11.  In fact, everything did
not change.  Most of us continue to lead lives that
are not wildly different from our pre-9/11 lives.  We
can work, travel, go to school, speak, write, and
question authority (most of the time anyways) freely. 
We still have a Constitution, providing (at least in
theory) checks on the power of each branch of
government.  

<p>No terrorist can take these things away from us.  The terrorists cannot rewrite our Constitution or take away our freedom.  They will never control our President, Congress, or courts.  

<p>I hope we will never have to see how our government
responds to another attack.  Unfortunately,
circumstances tell us that it is only prudent to
consider this possibility now, when there is at least
a chance of rational discussion. Perhaps it is
possible to figure out a way to guard against
excessive, unwarranted crackdowns on freedom-while, of
course, recognizing the need for legitimate, lawful
action designed to respond to real threats.

<p>Only we can take away our freedom.  We must make sure
that never happens.  Let's start a conversation about
these serious issues now, in a moment of relative calm
and sanity.
