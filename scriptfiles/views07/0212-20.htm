<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The  minimum wage is headed for a raise -- back to the 1950s. That's right, 
even  after rising from $5.15 now to $7.25 in 2009, the federal minimum wage 
will  still be lower than it was in 1956, when it was $7.41 in today's  dollars.

<p>The minimum wage was enacted in 1938 through the Fair Labor  Standards Act, 
designed to eliminate "labor conditions detrimental to the  maintenance of the 
minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency  and general 
well-being of workers."

<p>The minimum wage was never meant to  be the minimum the nation's worst 
employers want to pay. That would be as absurd  as setting environmental policies to 
accommodate the worst  polluters.

<p>Business lobbyists who'd abolish the minimum wage if they  could have held it 
hostage for 10 years -- the longest period ever without a  raise. Now they 
want to collect a ransom of tax breaks to let it  go.

<p>Since its last raise in 1997, the minimum wage has fallen 20 percent,  
adjusted for inflation, while domestic corporate profits are up 74 percent,  retail 
profits are up 55 percent, and business has reaped $312 billion in tax  breaks.

<p>"I'm sick of all the talk about business needing tax relief as  compensation 
for a higher minimum wage," says Steve Zorn, managing partner of  Castle 
Village Farm of Florida. "We don't need relief. Workers are the ones who  need 
relief. We've gotten plenty of tax breaks for business and certainly don't  need 
to pile more onto minimum wage legislation that won't hurt business to  begin 
with."

<p>Minimum wage critics predictably forecast dire consequences  with every 
raise, and are just as predictably wrong. After the last federal  minimum wage 
hikes in 1996 and 1997, the nation experienced dramatically  stronger job growth, 
and lower inflation and poverty rates. States that have  raised their minimum 
wages above $5.15 have had better employment and small  business trends than 
states that have not.

<p>Minimum wage raises aren't put  under mattresses -- or offshore tax havens. 
They are recycled back into the  economy.

<p>"Overall most low-wage workers pump every dollar of their  paychecks directly 
into the local economy by spending their money in their  neighborhood stores, 
local pharmacies and corner markets," notes Dan Gardner,  commissioner of 
Labor and Industries for Oregon, which has the nation's  second-highest minimum 
wage at $7.80.

<p>"Higher wages benefit business by  increasing consumer purchasing power, 
reducing costly employee turnover, raising  productivity, and improving product 
quality, customer satisfaction and company  reputation," says a statement 
supporting higher minimum wage signed by the CEOs  of Costco, the U.S. Women's 
Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Majority, Eileen  Fisher apparel company and 
more than 500 business owners across the nation --  from the Four Seasons 
Restaurant in New York and Dixie Rod & Custom in  Alabama to the Mercury Cafe in 
Colorado and Broetje Orchards in Washington. From  Candle Enterprises in 
Minnesota and Vintage Vinyl in Missouri to North Georgia  Woodworks and Small Biz 
Survival in Oklahoma.

<p>"Trying to save money by  shortchanging my employees would be like skimping 
on ingredients," explains  statement signer Kirsten Poole, co-owner of 
Kirsten's Cafe and Dish Caterers in  Silver Spring, MD. "I'd lose more than I saved 
because of declining quality,  service, reputation and customer base. You can't 
build a healthy business or a  healthy economy on a miserly minimum wage."

<p>U.S. Women's Chamber of  Commerce CEO Margot Dorfman says, "When businesses 
don't pay a living wage all  society pays. We pay through poverty and needless 
disease, disability and death  from inadequate health care. We pay as women 
struggle to put food on the table.  We pay as businesses and communities suffer 
economic decline."

<p>Successful  businesses like Kirsten's Cafe and Seventh Generation, the 
nation's leading  brand of non-toxic household products, know that miserly wages are 
toxic to our  families, communities and economy.

<p>If employers can't stay in business  without keeping their employees in 
poverty, there's something wrong with their  business models.

<p>Even at $7.25 an hour, the minimum wage would still be  two bucks short of 
the value it had in 1968, four decades ago.

<p>As the  business owners' statement says, "We cannot build a strong 21st 
century economy  when more and more hardworking Americans struggle to make ends  
meet."
