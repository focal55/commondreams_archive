<p>What do Americans want from their media? As a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, I hear a lot about this issue.</p>
<p>I hear that Americans want to listen to hometown talent on the radio and to see local issues and politicians covered on the nightly news. They want an in-depth look at what's going on at City Hall and the schools their children attend. In short, they want to know what's really going on in their neighborhoods and to see the essentials of their own lives reported accurately to the larger world.</p>
<p>This week, I'm visiting Philadelphia to hear about whether citizens in the City of Brotherly Love are getting the kind of media outlets they want and need. It's especially important to us because the Federal Communications Commission will soon be deciding whether to allow a small number of media giants to buy up the remaining local broadcasters and other media outlets across the land. We're here to listen to your thoughts at a town hall meeting Thursday at Temple University. (See below for more information.)</p>
<p>Once again, the openness of our media is under direct threat from the very federal agency charged with promoting media localism and diversity. Three years ago - in a process seemingly <i>designed</i> to exclude public comment - a majority at the FCC voted (over the objections of my colleague commissioner Jonathan Adelstein and me) to scrap many of the ownership limits. Instead, the agency's new rules allowed a single corporation to dominate local media markets by merging the community's TV stations, radio stations, newspaper and other outlets. A storm of public outrage ensued.</p>
<p>Three million citizens contacted the FCC to express their opposition to the new rules. I didn't know three million people knew there <i>was</i> an FCC! But these concerned Americans wrote us out of a strong belief that we desperately need rules to prevent one-size-fits-all news from becoming the acceptable standard in our communities.</p>
<p>Congress went on record with its concerns, too. And then a federal court found the rules both substantively and procedurally flawed and sent them back to us to rework. Several months ago, the FCC launched a review of these very same rules.</p>
<p>So a new dialogue is under way. But this time, it needs to be much more than an inside-the-Beltway discussion between a government agency and a few mega-corporations.</p>
<p>And this time, we have a double focus: first, to ensure that ownership rules are not further loosened; second and more important, we are looking at how we change the old rules that got us here in the first place. The fact is that the law no longer includes meaningful public-interest obligations for broadcasters, as we used to have. The environment in this country, however, has shifted and is hospitable to just this kind of national dialogue and action.</p>
<p>Let's remember that American citizens own the airwaves, not TV and radio executives. We give broadcasters the right to use these airwaves for free. They earn profits using this public resource in exchange for their agreement to broadcast in the public interest. We want to know - from you - whether Philadelphia's and the nation's broadcasters are holding up their end of the bargain.</p>
<p>Even if the future of our media is not your number-one issue, it needs to be - it <i>has</i> to be - your number-two issue. That's because Americans get their input and develop their views about all the other critical issues of the day - the war, jobs, the economy, health care, education, etc. - from the media. They learn about them on TV news, hear about them on the radio, and read about them in the newspaper. I can't think of any of these issues that wouldn't fare much better in an open, diverse, community-responsive, and competitive environment.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago, Gertrude Stein returned to her hometown to find that she could not locate the house in which she'd grown up. She is famously supposed to have said, "There is no there there." When our children look one day at the media system we have left them - and take up the reins of self-government - I hope they never have to share Stein's chilling conclusion.</p>
<p>So I urge you to attend this week's town meeting. We need your input and the input of as many of our fellow citizens as we can attract. I believe we have the best chance in our generation to settle this issue of who will control our media and for what purposes, and to resolve it in favor of airwaves of, by and for the people. But it will take a lot of us, working together, to make it happen.</p>
<p><i>Michael J. Copps is a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission. He and FCC commissioner Jonathan S. Adelstein will take part in a "Public Forum on Media Ownership" at 6 p.m. Thursday at Gladfelter Hall, Room 13, at Temple University. The forum is free and open to the public.</i></p>
