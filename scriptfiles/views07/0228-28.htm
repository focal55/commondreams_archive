<p><i>"The elimination of Natanz would be a major setback for Iran's nuclear ambitions, but the conventional weapons in the American arsenal could not insure the destruction of facilities under seventy-five feet of earth and rock, especially if they are reinforced with concrete."<br>
</i>—Seymour Hersh, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060417fa_fact" target="_blank"><i>The New Yorker</i>, April 17, 2006</a> 
<p><i>"The second concern is that if an underground laboratory is deeply buried, that can also confound conventional weapons. But the depth of the Natanz facility - reports place the ceiling roughly 30 feet underground - is not prohibitive. The American GBU-28 weapon - the so-called bunker buster - can pierce about 23 feet of concrete and 100 feet of soil. Unless the cover over the Natanz lab is almost entirely rock, bunker busters should be able to reach it. That said, some chance remains that a single strike would fail."<br>
</i>—Michael Levi, <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3091FFB3C5B0C7B8DDDAD0894DE404482&showabstract=1" target="_blank"><i>New York Times</i>, April 18, 2006</a>
<p>A familiar means of denying a reality is to refuse to use the words that describe that reality. A common form of propaganda is to keep reality from being described.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, silence and euphemism are forms of complicity both in propaganda and in the denial of reality. And the media, as well as the major presidential candidates, are now complicit.</p>
<p>The stories in the major media suggest that an attack against Iran is a real possibility and that the Natanz nuclear development site is the number one target. As the above quotes from two of our best sources note, military experts say that conventional "bunker-busters" like the GBU-28 <i>might</i> be able to destroy the Natanz facility, especially with repeated bombings. But on the other hand, they also say such iterated use of conventional weapons <i>might not</i> work, e.g., if the rock and earth above the facility becomes liquefied.  On that supposition, a "low yield" "tactical" nuclear weapon, say, the B61-11, <i>might</i> be needed.</p>

<p>If the Bush administration, for example, were to insist on a sure "success," then the "attack" would constitute <b>nuclear war</b>.  The words in boldface are <b>nuclear war</b>, that's right, <b>nuclear war</b> — a first strike <b>nuclear war</b>.</p>
<p>We don't know what exactly is being planned — conventional GBU-28's or nuclear B61-11's. And that is the point. Discussion needs to be open. <b>Nuclear war</b> is not a minor matter.</p>
<p><b>The Euphemism</b></p>

<p>As early as August 13, 2005, Bush, in Jerusalem, was asked what would happen if diplomacy failed to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear program. Bush replied, "All options are on the table."  On April 18, the day after the appearance of Seymour Hersh's <i>New Yorker</i> report on the administration's preparations for a <b>nuclear war</b> against Iran, President Bush held a news conference. He was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/04/20060418-1.html" target="_blank">asked</a>,</p>
<dl><dd><p>"Sir, when you talk about Iran, and you talk about how you have diplomatic efforts, you also say all options are on the table. Does that include the possibility of a nuclear strike? Is that something that your administration will plan for?"
</p></dd></dl>
<p>He replied,</p>
<dl><dd><p>"All options are on the table."</p></dd></dl>
<p>The President never actually said the forbidden words "nuclear war," but he appeared to tacitly acknowledge the preparations — without further discussion.</p>

<p>Vice-President Dick Cheney, speaking in Australia last week, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/02/20070224-1.html" target="_blank">backed up the President</a>.</p>
<dl><dd><p>"We worked with the European community and the United Nations to put together a set of policies to persuade the Iranians to give up their aspirations and resolve the matter peacefully, and that is still our preference. But I've also made the point, and the president has made the point, that all options are on the table."</p></dd></dl>
<p>Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain, on FOX News August 14, 2005, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,165666,00.html" target="_blank">said the same</a>.</p>
<dl><dd><p>"For us to say that the Iranians can do whatever they want to do and we won't under any circumstances exercise a military option would be for them to have a license to do whatever they want to do ... So I think the president's comment that we won't take anything off the table was entirely appropriate."</p></dd></dl>
<p>But it's not just Republicans. Democratic Presidential candidate John Edwards, in a speech in Herzliyah, Israel, <a href="http://www.herzliyaconference.org/Eng/_Articles/Article.asp?ArticleID=1728&CategoryID=223" target="_blank">echoed Bush</a>.</p>
<dl><dd><p>"To ensure that Iran never gets nuclear weapons, we need to keep ALL options on the table. Let me reiterate – ALL options must remain on the table."</p></dd></dl>

<p>Although, Edwards has said, when asked about this statement, that he prefers peaceful solutions and direct negotiations with Iran, he has nonetheless repeated the "all options on the table" position — making clear that he would consider starting a preventive <b>nuclear war</b>, but without using the fateful words.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton, at an AIPAC dinner in NY, <a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/hillary-to-aipac-talk-to-tehran-but-keep-all-opt/" target="_blank">said</a>,</p>
<dl><dd><p>"We cannot, we should not, we must not, permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons, and in dealing with this threat, as I have said for a very long time, no option can be taken off the table."</p></dd></dl>
<p>Translation: Nuclear weapons can be used to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, asked on <i>60 Minutes</i> about using military force to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, began a discussion of his preference for diplomacy by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/11/60minutes/main2458530_page3.shtml" target="_blank">responding</a>, "I think we should keep all options on the table."</p>

<p>Bush, Cheney, McCain, Edwards, Clinton, and Obama all say indirectly that they seriously consider starting a preventive <b>nuclear war</b>, but will not engage in a public discussion of what that would mean. That contributes to a general denial, and the press is going along with it by a corresponding refusal to use the words.</p>
<p>If the consequences of nuclear war are not discussed openly, the war may happen without an appreciation of the consequences and without the public having a chance to stop it. Our job is to open that discussion.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a rationale for the euphemism: To scare our adversaries by making them think that we are crazy enough to do what we hint at, while not raising a public outcry. That is what happened in the lead up to the Iraq War, and the disaster of that war tells us why we must have such a discussion about Iran. Presidential candidates go along, not wanting to be thought of as interfering in on-going indirect diplomacy. That may be the conventional wisdom for candidates, but an informed, concerned public <i>must</i> say what candidates are advised not to say.</p>
<p><b>More Euphemisms</b></p>
<p>The euphemisms used include "tactical," "small," "mini-," and "low yield" nuclear weapons.  "Tactical" contrasts with "strategic"; it refers to tactics, relatively low-level choices made in carrying out an overall strategy, but which don't affect the grand strategy. But the use of any nuclear weapons at all would be anything but "tactical." It would be a major world event – in Vladimir Putin's words, "lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons," making the use of more powerful nuclear weapons more likely and setting off a new arms race. The use of the word "tactical" operates to lessen their importance, to distract from the fact that their very use would constitute a <b>nuclear war</b>.</p>

<p>What is "low yield"?  Perhaps the "smallest" tactical nuclear weapon we have is the B61-11, which has a dial-a-yield feature: it can yield "only" 0.3 kilotons, but can be set to yield up to 170 kilotons. The power of the Hiroshima bomb was 15 kilotons. That is, a "small" bomb can yield more than 10 times the explosive power of the Hiroshima bomb.  The B61-11 dropped from 40,000 feet would dig a hole 20 feet deep and then explode, send shock waves downward, leave a huge crater, and spread radiation widely. The idea that it would explode underground and be harmless to those above ground is false — and, anyway, an underground release of radiation would threaten ground water and aquifers for a long time and over wide distance.</p>
<p>To use words like "low yield" or "small" or "mini-" nuclear weapon is like speaking of being a little bit pregnant. <b>Nuclear war is nuclear war!</b> It crosses the moral line.</p>
<p>Any discussion of roadside canister bombs made in Iran justifying an attack on Iran should be put in perspective: Little canister bombs (EFP's — explosively formed projectiles) that shoot a small hot metal ball at a humvee or tank versus <b>nuclear war</b>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the administration may be focusing on the canister bombs because it seeks to claim that the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 permits the use of military force against Iran based on its interference in Iraq. In that case, no further authorization by Congress would be needed for an attack on Iran.</p>
<p>The journalistic point is clear. Journalists and political leaders should not talk about an "attack." They should use the words that describe what is really at stake: <b>nuclear war — in boldface</b>.</p>

<p>Then, there is the scale of the proposed attack. Military reports leaking out suggest a huge (mostly or entirely non-nuclear) airstrike on as many as 10,000 targets — a "shock and awe" attack that would destroy Iran's infrastructure the way the US bombing destroyed Iraq's. The targets would not just be "military targets."  As Dan Plesch <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/200702190014" target="_blank">reports</a> in the New Statesman, February 19, 2007, such an attack would wipe out Iran's military, business, and political infrastructure. Not just nuclear installations, missile launching sites, tanks, and ammunition dumps, but also airports, rail lines, highways, bridges, ports, communications centers, power grids, industrial centers, hospitals, public buildings, and even the homes of political leaders.  That is what was attacked in Iraq: the "critical infrastructure." It is not just military in the traditional sense. It leaves a nation in rubble, and leads to death, maiming, disease, joblessness, impoverishment, starvation, mass refugees, lawlessness, rape, and incalculable pain and suffering. That is what the options appear to be "on the table." Is <b>nation destruction</b> what the American people have in mind when they acquiesce without discussion to an "attack"? Is <b>nuclear war</b> what the American people have in mind?  An informed public must ask and the media must ask. The words must be used.</p>
<p>Even if the attack were limited to nuclear installations, starting a <b>nuclear war</b> with Iran would have terrible consequences — and not just for Iranians. First, it would strengthen the hand of the Islamic fundamentalists — exactly the opposite of the effect US planners would want. It would be viewed as yet another major attack on Islam. Fundamentalist Islam is a revenge culture. If you want to recruit fundamentalist Islamists all over the world to become violent jihadists, this is the best way to do it. America would become a world pariah.  Any idea of the US as a peaceful nation would be destroyed. Moreover, you don't work against the spread of nuclear weapons by using those weapons. That will just make countries all over the world want nuclear weaponry all the more. Trying to stop nuclear proliferation through <b>nuclear war</b> is self-defeating.</p>

<p>As Einstein said, "You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war."</p>
<p>Why would the Bush administration do it?  Here is what conservative strategist William Kristol <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/433fwbvs.asp?pg=2" target="_blank">wrote</a> last summer during Israel's war with Hezbollah.</p>
<dl><dd><p><i>"For while Syria and Iran are enemies of Israel, they are also enemies of the United States. We have done a poor job of standing up to them and weakening them. They are now testing us more boldly than one would have thought possible a few years ago. Weakness is provocative. We have been too weak, and have allowed ourselves to be perceived as weak.</i></p>
<p><i>The right response is renewed strength--in supporting the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan, in standing with Israel, and in pursuing regime change in Syria and Iran. For that matter, we might consider countering this act of Iranian aggression with a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities. Why wait? Does anyone think a nuclear Iran can be contained? That the current regime will negotiate in good faith? It would be easier to act sooner rather than later. Yes, there would be repercussions--and they would be healthy ones, showing a strong America that has rejected further appeasement."</i></p>
<p>—Willam Kristol, Weekly Standard 7/24/06</p></dd></dl>
<p>"Renewed strength" is just the Bush strategy in Iraq. At a time when the Iraqi people want us to leave, when our national elections show that most Americans want our troops out, when 60% of Iraqis think it all right to kill Americans, Bush wants to escalate. Why? Because he is weak in America. Because he needs to show more "strength." Because, if he knocks out the Iranian nuclear facilities, he can claim at least one "victory." Starting a <b>nuclear war</b> with Iran would really put us in a world-wide war with fundamentalist Islam. It would make real the terrorist threat he has been claiming since 9/11. It would create more fear — real fear — in America. And he believes, with much reason, that fear tends to make Americans vote for saber-rattling conservatives.</p>

<p>Kristol's neoconservative view that "weakness is provocative" is echoed in Iran, but by the other side. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/24/washington/24policy.html?ex=1329973200&en=33fe14b2b78e3dc6&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss" target="_blank">quoted</a> in the New York Times of February 24, 2007 as having "vowed anew to continue enriching uranium, saying, 'If we show weakness in front of the enemies, they will increase their expectations.'" If both sides refuse to back off for fear of showing weakness, then prospects for conflict are real, despite the repeated analyses, like <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8668903" target="_blank">that of The Economist</a> that the use of nuclear weapons against Iran would be politically and morally impossible. As one unnamed administration official has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/24/washington/24policy.html?ex=1329973200&en=33fe14b2b78e3dc6&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss" target="_blank">said</a> (New York Times, February 24, 2007), "No one has defined where the red line is that we cannot let the Iranians step over."</p>
<p>What we are seeing now is the conservative message machine preparing the country to accept the ideas of a <b>nuclear war</b> and <b>nation destruction</b> against Iran.  The technique used is the "slippery slope." It is done by degrees.  Like the proverbial frog in the pot of water – if the heat is turned up slowly the frog gets used to the heat and eventually boils to death – the American public is getting gradually acclimated to the idea of war with Iran.</p>

<ul><li>First, describe Iran as evil – part of the axis of evil. An inherently evil person will inevitably do evil things and can't be negotiated with. An entire evil nation is a threat to other nations.
<li>Second, describe Iran's leader as a "Hitler" who is inherently "evil" and cannot be reasoned with. Refuse to negotiate with him.
<li>Then repeat the lie that Iran is on the verge of having nuclear weapons —weapons of mass destruction. IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei says they are at best many years away.
<li>Call nuclear development "an existential threat" – a threat to our very existence.
<li>Then suggest a single "surgical" "attack" on Natanz and make it seem acceptable.
<li>Then find a reason to call the attack "self-defense" — or better protection for our troops from the EFP's, or single-shot canister bombs.
<li>Claim, without proof and without anyone even taking responsibility for the claim, that the Iranian government at its highest level is supplying deadly weapons to Shiite militias attacking our troops, while not mentioning the fact that Saudi Arabia is helping Sunni insurgents attacking our troops.
<li>Give "protecting our troops" as a reason for attacking Iran without getting new authorization from Congress. Claim that the old authorization for attacking Iraq implied doing "whatever is necessary to protect our troops" from Iranian intervention in Iraq.
<li>Argue that de-escalation in Iraq would "bleed" our troops, "weaken" America, and lead to defeat. This sets up escalation as a winning policy, if not in Iraq then in Iran.
<li>Get the press to go along with each step.
<li>Never mention the words "preventive <b>nuclear war</b>" or "<b>national destruction</b>." When asked, say "All options are on the table." Keep the issue of <b>nuclear war</b> and its consequences from being seriously discussed by the national media.

<li>Intimidate Democratic presidential candidates into agreeing, without using the words, that nuclear war should be "on the table." This makes <b>nuclear war</b> and <b>nation destruction</b> bipartisan and even more acceptable.
</ul>
<p>Progressives managed to blunt the "surge" idea by telling the truth about "escalation." <b>Nuclear war</b> against Iran and <b>nation destruction</b> constitute the ultimate escalation.</p>
<p>The time has come to stop the attempt to make a <b>nuclear war</b> against Iran palatable to the American public. We do not believe that most Americans want to start a <b>nuclear war</b> or to impose <b>nation destruction</b> on the people of Iran. They might, though, be willing to support a tit-for-tat "surgical" "attack" on Natanz in retaliation for small canister bombs and to end Iran's early nuclear capacity.</p>

<p>It is time for America's journalists and political leaders to put two and two together, and ask the fateful question: Is the Bush administration seriously preparing for <b>nuclear war</b> and <b>nation destruction</b>? If the conventional GBU-28's will do the job, then why not take nuclear war off the table in the name of controlling the spread of nuclear weapons? If GBU-28's won't do the job, then it is all the more important to have that discussion.</p>
<p>This should not be a distraction from Iraq. The general issue is escalation as a policy, both in Iraq and in Iran. They are linked issues, not separate issues. We have learned from Iraq what lack of public scrutiny does.</p>
