<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->     <p>       This year a single mother cannot raise her children in their home        because it has been destroyed. It has not been destroyed by natural        disaster or fire; it has melted away. This mother is a polar bear and        like many other polar bears in the Arctic, her home has gradually been        destroyed as more sea ice melts every summer and less sea ice freezes        again in the winter. There has been a trend of a 3 percent decrease in        sea ice each decade in the Arctic since 1978.     </p>     
<p>       Polar bears are strong swimmers that can swim far into the open ocean        but some have been found drowned in the Arctic Ocean because they could        not find a piece of ice large enough to climb onto. Those that have made        it to solid land are hard-pressed to find food and have been observed        futilely hunting geese and caribou until they give up and instead raid a        human village.     </p>     <p>       This decrease in habitat has been devastating to the polar bear, which        may be the largest canary in the environmental mine shaft. This threat        to the polar bears has been recognized by the Bush administration in        recent days, as polar bears are slated to be listed as a &#8220;threatened&#8221;        species under the Endangered Species Act.     </p>     <p>       We in Rhode Island are not that different from the polar bears in the        Arctic. We, too, depend on the stability of the environment. Not unlike        polar bears, human families who live close to the water may see a threat        to the survival of their way of life as water levels continue to rise.        Natural disasters such as hurricanes can make the threat all the more        real and immediate.     </p>     <p>       Here in Rhode Island we have shown initiative, ingenuity and empathy        regarding polar bears by giving them a safe and accommodating habitat        and making them a symbol of our concern for species other than        humankind. The recent passage of $11 million in state bond money for        major upgrades and improvements at Roger Williams Park Zoo includes a        new world-class polar bear habitat nine times larger than the previous        one. This attraction will serve as the center of the zoo&#8217;s new North        American Trail. These publicly endorsed upgrades are a strong statement        of our support for high-quality facilities for animals removed from the        wild. We need to protect and nurture our own habitat with the same care        and attention.     </p>     <p>       I came here from North Carolina to attend the University of Rhode        Island&#8217;s internationally renowned Graduate School of Oceanography, and I        was surprised to experience autumn weather that was very similar to the        autumn I had known over 800 miles to the south.     </p>     <p>       While one autumn is not sufficient to make a final judgment, over the        past 50 years, the average water temperature of Narragansett Bay has        increased 2-5 degrees Fahrenheit. This may not seem like a lot but it        has been enough to sometimes make Narragansett Bay a habitable        environment for a large number of such tropical fish as puffer fish,        butterfly fish, and damsel fish This small temperature increase is also        suspected to be a catalyst for the almost complete annihilation of the        winter-flounder population in the Bay.     </p>     <p>       During the same period the average yearly air temperature of Providence        has increased 2 degrees and the precipitation has increased 20 percent        in many parts of the state. With the conservative projected temperature        increase of another 4 degrees over the next 100 years, Rhode Island&#8217;s        average temperature would be similar to the average temperature of        Baltimore today. In short, we are becoming a southern estuary in the        north.     </p>     <p>       How are we affected? We are Rhode Islanders; many of us are dependent        upon Narragansett Bay and its watershed. The state seal has the word        &#8220;Hope&#8221; so appropriately placed on it. We are the &#8220;Lively Experiment.&#8221; We        can make a difference reducing the temperature rise. This involves more        than just sending money to polar-bear organizations; it demands a change        in lifestyle, attitude and policy. But every little bit helps.     </p>     <p>       For a start, you and your family can go see the new polar-bear exhibit        at Roger Williams Park Zoo, once it has been completed, and ride a nice        RIPTA bus to get there. We can save our giant canaries, the polar bears        &#8212; our environmental barometers thousands of miles away &#8212; and in doing so        we will save ourselves here in Rhode Island.     </p>     <p>       By putting a halt to these weather trends in the Arctic, we would        prevent the disastrous impacts of global climate change already        occurring in the Arctic from reaching us here in Rhode Island.     </p>
