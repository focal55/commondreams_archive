<p><i>It cost about 75 cents to kill a man in Caesar's time. The price rose to about $3,000 per man during the Napoleonic wars; to $5,000 in the American Civil War; and then to $21,000 per man in World War I. Estimates for the future wars indicate that it may cost the warring countries not less than $50,000 for each man killed</i>.

--
Senator Homer T. Bone (D-WA) c.1938

<p>About the same time Marine General Smedley D. Butler, one of our all time great generals (and a Quaker who used "thee" and "thou" in everyday speech) said: "Wars do not occur. They are made by men. . . . Lying propaganda is almost certainly necessary to bring nations to the pitch where men kill and women give their men and boys to be killed.."

<p>This week the President’s FY 2008 Budget came out, four fat volumes with 2500 words and scores of computer files. In money terms it totals $2.7 trillion, including $100 billion more for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and allover defense spending of $624.6 billion. 


<p>In political terms it’s a mission-statement of the priorities for spending the public’s money according to the fantasies and fables of Bush’s neocon tribe: continuing tax breaks for the wealthy; cutting assistance for child care, preventive medicine, education; health care reform that profits the insurance industry and punishes low and middle income people; putting global warming in the hands of the oil and automobile industry. And a defense budget that increases spending to escalate the war in Iraq and make it possible to attack Iran. 


<p>In human terms it’s a statement about how much of our money the President is willing to hand over to defense industry stockholders and executives to spend on killing – not just men but also women and children. 

<p>In the wake of publication of the budget, aspiring presidents and wealthy men from the media, defense industries, think-tanks, and policy-shops have leaped into public arena, dismissing critics or proposing simple quick fixes for perceived shortcomings. Most recognize that we have to settle the mess in the Middle East, and at least nod toward the problem of global warming. 

<p>David Ignatius of the Washington Post (2/7/07) suggested five easy steps of ‘crisis management’ for the Middle East:

<p>-Contain sectarian violence. Good idea. We certainly don’t want the Shia - Sunni fight extending over the entire Middle East. But we don’t know how to do it. We do (now) have a pretty good idea how NOT to do it.

<p>However, one translation of "contain sectarian violence" is to keep the sectarian violence in Iraq and don’t let Iran in on it. This seems to be what Secretary Rice is working for, and it doesn’t sound promising, especially for Iraq.

<p>-Protect the oil: "United States should be planning with its allies how to secure the region's oil." Er ... whose oil is it, anyway? It’s not ours. In a very broad sense, the oil belongs to the Earth. Shall a few wealthy Earthlings be empowered to prosper and profit by owning, managing, selling, brokering and burning the planet’s sequestered ancient hydrocarbons, releasing their carbon into the only atmosphere we have, where it will change the terms of life on Earth? 

<p>-Shield the Iraqi population: How? with more war, weapons, aerial bombardment, soldiers?

<p>Ignatius’other steps are sound. We must talk with Iraq’s neighbors and we must help establish a Palestinian state – with talk, not weapons.

<p>Meanwhile, this week the Bush administration declined to sign a UN treaty banning secret detentions. Congress has been dancing a stately Minuet about the war in Iraq, while those who elected them fume: "Pick up the tempo, leave out the repeats and da capo, and get on to the last movement by cutting off funding for this war that is already lost."

<p>This week, as Congress started teasing out where the money they had already appropriated for Iraq had gone, Paul Bremer admitted that he didn’t know what had happened to the12 tons of shrink-wrapped $100 bills ($12 billion) he had had shipped to Baghdad..

<p>Also this week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presented persuasive evidence that human activity is degrading the systems that regulate Earth’s temperature, and that Earth – the only known habitable planet in the universe – may already be in runaway overheating.

<p>In recent months blogs have been circulating an estimate of the cost to Americans of killing one person in the war on terror: $3,446,184.34 – based on a total war cost of $2.3 trillion.

<p>My rough calculations, using a smaller figure from the running meter displayed by the National Priorities Project. ( <a href="http://costofwar.com/index.html%20" target="_new">http://costofwar.com/index.html </a>) – $364,629,773,037 (at 9PM ET, 2/7/07) – give a more modest cost for killing one person: $561,538. 

<p>Interestingly, the number of Americans chipping in to kill one Iraqi child is pretty much the same for both estimates: 456 for the former and 461 for the latter. 

<p>Seventy years ago Senator Bone was off by at least an order of magnitude, but Smedley Butler, was right on about the causes and consequences of war.  Butler also wrote a book entitled "War is a Racket," and when he quoted Sherman’s "war is hell," he pointedly asked "But what in the hell are we going to do about it?"

<p>Molly Ivins answered that question in her last column, before she died last month:

<p>"Raise hell. ... We need people in the streets, banging pots and pans and demanding, "Stop it, now!"

<p>Or there will be hell to pay, for our Earth and all her children.
