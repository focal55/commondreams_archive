      <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">A
friend of ours, a recent college graduate who now lives in Germany,
just e-mailed some good news: "Yesterday, my employer presented me with
a written job offer. A monthly salary of E3,000 (circa $4,000) before
taxes, a title of manager in marketing/communications, a provisionary
time of six months (during which I can technically be fired with a
notice of four weeks), 30 vacation days per year, and the possibility
for a bonus that is calculated on the number of projects that we
complete annually that I think, could reach as high as E5,600." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">If
you only read George Will (Dwindling unions seek employer muzzle, BDN
March 1) — your immediate reaction might be to repeat the standard
business press mantra: Europe is going down the tube because workers
have too much power. A rookie employee must get a month’s free vacation
and even in the first six months has to be given a month’s notice
before you sack him! Though our friend’s position is not covered by a
union, he and many other European workers have achieved comparable
benefits and protections due to heavy union density and laws enacted by
union-backed social democratic parties. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">Here
in America, workers and bosses are cut out of tougher stuff. Not only
do bosses not want unions, so, we are told, most employees don’t want
them either. Unions, Will suggests, have used the excuse of anti-union
pressure by employers to explain their declining presence. He contends
that "such supposed pressure is one of organized labor’s alibis for
declining membership."</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">There
are, however, ample protections against employer pressures that really
are abusive. Today’s work force is marvelously flexible. People
entering the labor market at age 18 will have, on average, 10 employers
by the time they are 38. Such mobile workers often do not see what
value union membership would add to their lives."</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">One
wonders what Will means by abusive practices? For a law and order
conservative, Will takes a curiously lax attitude toward lawlessness on
a massive scale. Even George Bush’s National Labor Relations Board, the
most conservative and pro-business in the board’s history, has found
illegal management activity, usually firing suspected union supporters,
in one of every four union elections. The kind of free speech of which
Will claims to be so solicitous evokes employer intimidation because
the penalties are trivial.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">In
a recent e-mail exchange, Matt Beck, an organizer for the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, pointed just how heavily the cards
are stacked against union activists in Maine: "I have to warn these
union activists that there is a fairly good chance that they will get
fired for their organizing activities. If they do, we will fight to get
them their jobs back, but in the meantime, all of their co-workers will
be so freaked out that the union campaign is likely to fail." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">In
recent years, American workers have been very productive, but they have
been unable to recoup their fair share of productivity gains. In the
last three decades, the period in which corporate employers have been
conducting their most systematic attacks on unions, worker compensation
gains have trailed gains in their productivity by 50 percent. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">Many
Maine and U.S. workers are aware of these facts. Polls conducted over
many years show that more workers want some form of independent voice
in the workplace. As Beck points out, union members aren’t getting rich
but "at least they are earning a respectable wage. And they have a
voice at the table, which is something conservative ideologues such as
George Will clearly resent."</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">European
economies have problems, but their performance belies the simple
conservative notion that low taxes and "flexible," i.e. nonunion,
workplaces are the key to prosperity or competitiveness. A recent study
by the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives shows that European
nations have not had to sacrifice economic gains in order to afford a
reasonable level of protection for the most vulnerable and basic
workplace rights for all employees. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">Unlike
the U.S., Europe runs a consistent balance of trade surplus. The Nordic
states are especially strong along such economic performance measures
as unit labor costs and high GDP per hour worked even as they have
achieved greater income equality, more leisure time, and higher levels
of social satisfaction. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">American
corporations now enjoy inordinate privileges in our law. They are legal
persons with guarantees of limited liability that protect their
investors against any loss greater than the amount of their initial
investment regardless of how socially or environmentally destructive
their corporate performance. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">Corporations
that deny basic rights of self-protection to their workers should lose
their corporate charter. American corporations function best both for
their investors and the larger society when they face some effective
countervailing power. U.S. workers, no matter what their level of
education, are unlikely to enjoy the kind of job our friend has
recently been offered as long as U.S. management can so easily crush
efforts to discuss — let alone commence — unionization.<br>
