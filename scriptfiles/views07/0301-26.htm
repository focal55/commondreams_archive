<p>The free trade momentum that started in the US, UK and Latin America under heavy US influence, has run its course. Our world has been molded- some times and places for the better and others not- by a vastly expanded place for international trade, finance and corporate activity. Market enabling, deregulatory, tax/tariff reducing and state action constricting changes have swept across the globe. In many places gains and losses have piled up and constituencies for and against the recent trajectory have emerged. This is clear in the developed and the developing world. One transnational state, the US, has emerged. Alongside this behemoth various regional powers are rising and able to contest American hegemony through alliance. The institutions created to govern a Post WWII world have encountered significant falls from grace and rising tides of hostility. Some feel they have been co-opted by the market forces they exist to limit. Others see them as obstacles to the forward march of economic efficiency. From the right and left the Bretton Woods Institutions and the UN are under increased suspicion and critique. Unilaterialist, short sighted and crudely aggressive policy has flowed from America. All of this has occurred as inequalities of wealth and opportunity expand between and within nations. A legitimacy and consensus vacuum of epic proportion has emerged.   

 

<p>Contesting institutions and groups emerge to fill this void. Herein lays threat and possibility. Globalization of economic activity, culture and terrorism demand global leadership. Regional blocks have rushed to fill the void. In South America a progressive inflected nationalism has emerged at ballot boxes and on the streets. In the Islamic world hostility to religious-cultural influences and political meddling has reached a boiling point. Africa hosts precious few success stories, endemic poverty, instabilities and conflicts that threaten metastasis. East and South Asia loom ever larger as their aggregate economic growth transforms global realities. The inequalities within India and China hint at great tensions and frailties within these precious models of successful development. In the US, EU and Japan fears for job security are combining with historically anomalously long periods of real wage decline. Developed world consensus toward free trade- always thin- is fraying.

 

<p>This could not be happening at a worse time. The tensions, inequities and disappointments that fuel oppositions- right, left and center- are intensifying. Leadership and cooperative action are ever more required to address internationally reactive realities. Domestic and regional issues have international effects and causes. Increasingly this is recognized. Far too often, collective action and policy coordination are not forthcoming. 

<p>Major policy issues are not addressed within a unifying framework which expresses civil society’s ultimate goals. Concerted global government action instead has been replaced on an issue by issue basis by powerful international corporations (TNC) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO). Consequently the issues that receive attention are either those issues that impact long term corporate profitability, or those can be made to illicit institutional or donor interest and sympathy.

 

<p>When and where corporate interests and NGO visions are compatible, rapid improvements and awe inspiring successes are recorded. However, this is haphazard and far from adequately broad. Leading states have grievously dropped the ball. The US has veered off course foreclosing viable coalition and consensus building. The EU has not taken up the slack as struggles continue regarding the size, shape and contours of a growing and increasingly diverse Europe. Russia is in the process of re-emerging as a global heavy weight and struggles under uncertainties regarding a Putin successor. Tony Blair is stepping down- or at least he has promised to. Chirac will pass the torch in France and Merkel is very new to power- especially by German standards. China is still finding her way to global policy influence. The early stages of this process involve pragmatic approaches for resource access and an awareness that Sino-US tension can not and will not always be profitably avoided. India is yet to forcefully emerge as a policy setter. It seems just a matter of time before this happens. New governments in Latin America are beginning to stretch their regional influence. This has been inconsistent, is recent and portends tensions among aspirants. 

 

<p>The political leadership of both powerful states and International organizations is at a crossroads. The leadership deficit brought about by the diminished role of the US has been acerbated by confusion at the top for the other major global players. Powerful states have offered little, late and often narrowly self-interested agendas. This serves to further fracture and alienate the components of workable consensus. Each focal issue that goes unresolved or fails dramatically, angers and disappoints significant constituencies, weakens belief in compromise and shakes the authority of consensus advocates. 

 

<p>he world’s major international organizations have been either blocked from, or unwilling to assert global unifying solution. The EU has not been capable of asserting global leadership while getting its house in order. The United Nations, hampered by a deeply distrusted Security Council, has not risen to the challenge in several key recent instances. The newly selected Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon appears to be eschewing controversy as he learns his job. Pascal Lamay’s WTO is threatened with marginalization as the Doha Round is defined by inability of the major powers to find common negotiating ground. The IMF and World Bank struggle under popular anger, funding restriction and attacks launched from left, right and center. Past misadventures in stabilization and adjustment policy weigh heavily on credibility. The costs associated with financial crises and debt repayments are widely resented. Incomplete reforms and failed projects are oft sited. Thus, there is much anger across a wide spectrum of political and economic views. Some anger is merited, much is not. Nonetheless, angers and accusations shape and define IMF and World Bank action, advice and report.

 

<p>Robert Gates, US Secretary of Defense, recently declared his feeling of being almost filled with nostalgia for the less complex time of the Cold War. We are left to assume he meant this narrowly in terms of the prime directives that guided policy in the US DOD 1945-1990. Glaringly, the end of the Cold War has resulted in the sole superpower forfeiting the mandates of leadership; substituting the arrogance of independent action for the consensus building of a leader. This has been “achieved” under the mantra of sovereignty. This is a curious and unfortunate ideological push from a hegemon demanding compromise of others.

 

 

<p>The end result of this leadership deficit has been a weakening of global governance at the very time when it is most needed. Economic and security situations are emerging which can not effectively be managed within the borders of individual states. Despite their power and integrity NGOs generally lack the breadth, depth and global action platform required. Failed states are cropping up all over the globe pressing the urgency of the leadership vacuum. There exist a disturbing and rising number of geographic areas where no government can mold majority will; erect or maintain a viable legitimate internal economy or guarantee basic security and state services. The unevenness of cost and benefit distribution flowing from globalization threatens to undermine the global free market. Despite its many and sometimes severe failings, this is the mechanism that most links nations and offers mutually beneficial opportunity. The developed world has been drifting toward protectionism as the developing world losses faith in the prospects of their day in the market sun. By way of example, House Finance Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D: Massachusetts) has said that unless we see more benefits coming to American workers, no more international free trade agreements will pass the US House of Representatives. The continued failure of the Doha Round of WTO talks speaks to the breadth of this problem globally. 

 

<p>As the need for coordinated action grows and resistance to the status quo proliferates, we don’t see a similar growth in viable plans of action. There are great inequities streaming from recent developments in globalization. There are many- too many- still not integrated into the international economy. Worse still, there are nations and regions that are integrated in ways that deepen and extend their poverty. There is much filthy bathwater to be changed. When there is concerted redress it often seems to advocate throwing out the baby with the bathwater. 

 

<p>The power vacuum created by the lack of global political leadership will be filled, if not by representative government organizations then by other forces that today’s globalization empowers. The powerful global forces of Transnational Corporations (TNCs) and International Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) abhor many elements of the present power vacuum and have been rushing to fill the void with line item governance and outsourced power. The potential power of these entities is not often fully appreciated. Major corporations account for 50 of the top 100 economies in the world. The largest NGOs control annual budgets several times larger than many of the states that they work in. TNC and NGO alike are market diven. The case for this reality is probably adequately self evident in the TNC case. NGOs are often funded by the great fortunes of globalization and regularly turn to fundraising for programs, expansions and survival. They look to TNC giving and giving from the wealth of individuals invested in globalization. 

 

<p>Thus, we are seeing the rise of private global governance by NGO and TNC. This is most clear in vital regions were pressing humanitarian concern and vital resources compel leading firms and NGOs to operate in the absence of local or international governmental authority. Ironically, the absence of effective state control, international consensus and enforcement has created private patchworks of enterprise and outreach authority. Is this the future? It certainly is absent the ability of states to agree and inter-governmental consortia to perform. We are seeing an uncoordinated privatization of functions that states evolved to perform.  

 

 

<p>Governments evolved to establish and protect individual liberties, property rights and social cohesion from the ravages of unregulated markets. The major issues of the day are those of economic development, economic justice, war, peace, liberty and property. Either co-ordination will be carved out of the present tangle of myopic agenda and dysfunction, or market sensitive private solution will struggle to crawl out of the global market swamps and learn to walk and run on dry land. This will be a slow and painful process.
