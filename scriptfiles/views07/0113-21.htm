For decades, conservatives have railed against liberals as "weak on defense," content to let U.S. military readiness decline to dangerous levels. Such 
accusations over the nation's military readiness, in personnel as well as 
equipment, have proven pivotal in numerous elections. Many progressives still 
have to learn how to express their views on security in more compelling ways, 
but we can no longer let conservatives remain unchallenged on their security 
credentials.
<P>In light of this week's announced escalation, conservatives must now be 
challenged to prove where their loyalties lie, with Bush or with our armed 
forces, breaking under the strain of his failed policies.</P></DIV>
<P>As George Lakoff and the Rockridge Institute explored in our recent book <A 
href="http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/thinkingpoints"><EM>Thinking 
Points</EM></A> (Chapter 6), conservatives regard security as the use of force, 
while progressives view security as protection. &nbsp;To make sure that our 
ports, our infrastructure, and our troops are protected is part of the 
progressive understanding of security as protection. &nbsp;Bush's policies take 
the conservative conception of security to its absurd conclusion. &nbsp;It 
emphasizes the use of force to challenge threats and potential threats to the 
exclusion of other tools, such as diplomacy. &nbsp;Secretary of State Rice or 
other officials are dispatched to shore up support for military action, not to 
broker political compromises that would make military action unnecessary. 
&nbsp;Even providing adequate body armor, part of the progressive concept of 
protection as security, is not a priority to this administration. &nbsp;<BR></P>
<P>We have seen the consequences of the conservative reliance on the projection 
of force to provide security. &nbsp;As Bush sends over 20,000 more soldiers to 
face an impossible mission, we have every reason to fear worse consequences to 
come. &nbsp;Given these stakes, no conservative should be permitted to make the 
claim to being "strong on defense" unchallenged unless he or she promptly 
repudiates the Bush administration policies that threaten our armed forces.</P>
<P>More than any foreign enemy could, Bush is breaking our armed forces, and we 
must not shy away from this accurate framing. &nbsp;Consider a few of the many 
ways that Bush and his conservative supporters are actively breaking our armed 
forces:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Even before Bush's latest plans for escalation of U.S. troop levels amid 
  Iraq's civil war and provocative moves toward Iran, the increasing strain on 
  America's armed forces was apparent. In July 2006, it was <A 
  href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w060911&amp;s=bergmannkorbogden091306">revealed</A> 
  that two-thirds of the active U.S. Army was classified officially as "not 
  ready for combat." <BR>
  <LI>In October 2006, retired General Barry McCaffrey <A 
  href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5039515,00.html">warned</A>, 
  "The United States Army is stumbling toward the edge of a cliff. It's starting 
  to unravel." A new international crisis, he suggested, could lead it past the 
  breaking point. 
  <LI>To provide the troop numbers Bush demands, <A 
  href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070112/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_iraq_military">the 
  Pentagon has been forced to abandon its limit</A> on the time that those in 
  the National Guard or Reserves can be required to serve on active duty. 
  &nbsp;A citizen-soldier may now be deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan for up to 
  two years at a time, as many times as needed. 
  <LI>After the many failures of Donald Rumsfeld, the replacement that Bush 
  offers our armed forces, is Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, whose <A 
  href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6339265,00.html">recent 
  admissions</A> include, "I would confess I'm no expert on Iraq" and the 
  statement that he is "no expert on military matters." &nbsp;In Congressional 
  testimony, Gates also said it would be a "mistake" to offer an exit strategy, 
  something that Bush called a necessity when he first ran for president. 
  <LI>In contrast to the advice of the Iraq Study Group to engage in diplomacy 
  with Iraq's neighbors, Bush instead issued a warning to Syria and Iran, which 
  was soon followed by a raid on an Iranian consulate in Irbil. &nbsp;As Juan 
  Cole has <A 
  href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/01/12/iran/">observed</A>, 
  such provocative moves could easily lead to aggressive military actions 
  against Iran. &nbsp;That would clearly constitute an additional international 
  crisis of the scale that McCaffrey warned could break our armed 
forces.</LI></UL>
<P>Bush has pushed our armed forces, our nation, and the Middle East to the 
brink of a precipice. &nbsp;To date, he has enjoyed the full support of 
conservatives who proclaim themselves patriotic defenders of our military and 
our country. &nbsp;With Bush's latest plans for escalation in Iraq and 
confrontation of Iran, we have both the responsibility and the opportunity to 
confront those who have enabled Bush to pursue this destructive path. 
&nbsp;Reject Bush or stand complicit with him in breaking our armed forces? 
<BR></P>We have seen some conservative politicians distance themselves from 
Bush's latest plan already, but mild criticism is not enough. Bush's policies 
damage our armed forces far more than any terrorist attack has; he should be 
regarded accordingly. For conservatives to continue to abet Bush's disastrous 
schemes without facing the consequences is, in Bush's words, "unacceptable." 
&nbsp;If progressives hit this point hard and conservatives fail to rethink 
their definition of security as the projection of force, then progressives could 
have the opportunity to capture the mantle of strength for a generation.
