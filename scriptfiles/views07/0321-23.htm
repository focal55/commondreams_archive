This is the car the automakers refuse to make. 
<p>Five years ago, the auto industry was issued a challenge. That was when 
California passed a law requiring the industry to reduce global-warming 
pollution from its cars and trucks. Since then, 10 other states have adopted 
that standard. Together, these 11 states represent one-third of the U.S. auto 
market. Instead of rising to this challenge, the automakers filed lawsuits in 
California and two other states to kill the standard  --  even though they have 
the technology today to surpass it. 
</p><p>Before joining the staff of the Union of Concerned Scientists, I worked as 
a consultant for the major automakers, so I know first-hand that they can do 
better. Working with other UCS vehicle experts, I recently designed a "virtual" 
vehicle that combines a number of pollution-cutting technologies under one 
hood. Our blueprint, which we call the Vanguard, is not a hybrid. It doesn't 
use fuel cells. It merely puts together conventional off-the-shelf technologies 
that can already be found piecemeal in more than 100 vehicles on the road 
today. Installing these technologies in everything from two-seaters to SUVs 
could cut their global-warming pollution by as much as 40 percent. Adopting the 
Vanguard "package" in California alone would be the equivalent of taking 19 
million of today's vehicles off the road. 
</p><p>Not only would the Vanguard package help save the planet, it would save 
Americans millions of dollars annually. The minivan package, for example, would 
pay for itself in less than two years and deliver $1,333 in savings over the 
vehicle's lifetime. From 2009, when the standard is supposed to take effect, to 
2030, California drivers would save  $2.6 billion. 
</p><p>OK, that all sounds almost too good to be true, but what would it be like 
to drive? Not to worry. The Vanguard would be just as fast, safe and reliable 
as today's vehicles. In fact, the Vanguard package actually would give you a 
smoother ride than the car you're driving today.
<br></p><hr>
Here's a look at some of the key features of this cleaner car: 

<p>
</p><p>Transmission: The Vanguard has a six-speed automatic-manual transmission 
that delivers a smoother ride and allows the engine to operate at top 
efficiency. There's no clutch: You switch gears by simply pushing a button on 
your dashboard. If you don't want manual control, the car will do the shifting 
for you. 
</p><p>Engine: Cylinder deactivation will give you muscle only when you need it, 
saving you money and cutting pollution. If you're cruising down the highway 
with no passengers, two of the six cylinders will shut down seamlessly. When 
you lean on the gas, go up a hill, or load your car with six kids headed to 
soccer practice, the extra cylinders will kick back on. 
</p><p>Electrical system: Electric power steering will let you change direction 
with an electric motor instead of a hydraulic pump, providing faster, more 
responsive steering and consuming less energy.  
</p><p>Ethanol: Building cars that can use as much as 85 percent ethanol from 
plants would help cut global-warming pollution. Corn ethanol can cut pollution 
10 to 30 percent compared to gasoline, while cellulosic ethanol from 
switchgrass, wood chips and other materials would cut pollution by as much as 
90 percent. As more gas stations offer ethanol, you will be able to fill your 
car with homegrown, clean, renewable fuel.  
</p><p>Aerodynamics: The Vanguard is streamlined to use less energy fighting air 
resistance. In some models, the updated design would provide more space for 
passengers and storage. 
</p><p>Air conditioning: The Vanguard's cooling system would keep the planet 
cool, too. Tighter hoses and cleaner refrigerants would keep global-warming 
pollution out of the atmosphere, while more efficient air compressors wouldn't 
tax the engine as much.<br>
