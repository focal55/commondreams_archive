<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->My dear friend, Diane Baker, from Dallas-Ft. Worth who is a United Church of Christ Minister and fearless crusader for peace is also a grandmother, has a degenerative disease, and was sweeping garbage in DC for being arrested there this past October protesting the illegal and immoral war in Iraq: to save your children and the children of Iraq.
 
<p>Three grandmas are going to Federal Prison for 1-3 months each for protesting the inhumane and horrifically criminal School of the Americas at Ft. Benning, Ga. They compromised the fence line protesting how the SOA (School of Assassins) training of murderers who oppress, torture and kill people all over the world...even throwing in a few South American dictators here and there. They did it to save your children and the children of the world.
 
<p>My "grannies' in the Granny Peace Brigade get arrested over and over again all over the country trying to enlist in the US military to save your children and the children of Iraq.
 
<p>Diane was sentenced to eight hours of sweeping trash in DC; which is a filthy city, but the trash that needs to be taken out resides in the White House. Diane was doing what each and every American has the right and the moral duty to do: she was exercising her First Amendment freedoms and her obligation to dissent against an out of control government. The "compassionate" judge ordered Diane, who is obviously physically challenged by her disease, to do this community service in freezing weather. Diane's entire life is community service to her country and to her patients in the hospice where she lovingly helps people go to the other side. 
 
<p>War is peace; hate is love; injustice is justice; indifference is compassion and this country is seriously upside down from over six years of an administration that thinks that good things are happening in a country where their policies have killed almost a million people and a "president" that goes to Wall Street to congratulate the only people who are benefit ting from his tax cuts and war for profit.
 
<p>The members of Congress who role into their comfortable offices from hired cars and walk between their offices and the Congress building in underground tunnels in the oppressive heat of summer, or the dire cold of winter; are contemplating weak and cowardly measures for only symbolic opposition to a war that is killing the children of the sinking middle class in this country and the brown, non-Christian, non-English speaking children of Iraq. The people in the US who have everything to lose are allowing Congress to be complicit in the war crimes of BushCo.
 
<p>The people of the US are also allowing Grannies to do the heavy lifting and hard work and prison time for us all. These wonderfully brave and committed women should be home playing and spoiling their own grandchildren, but they are putting their tired and sometimes diseased bodies on the line for yours.
 
<p>Beginning on Monday, February 5th, the Occupation Project is beginning sit-ins in every House Rep and Senator's offices across this nation to demand an end to the war in Iraq by voting "nay" to giving any more money to BushCo for their murderous war.
<p>Join the Occupation. Put your body on the line like these brave Grandmas have and as our brave, tired, and deceived soldiers do everyday for BushCo's lies.
 
<p>Do it for all the children.
