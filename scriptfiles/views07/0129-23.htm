<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->There were a lot of things to love about the president's State of the Union address last week.</p><p class="articleGraf">Here are just a few of them:</p>
<li class="inGraf"> The president did not smirk. There is, after all, nothing smirkable just now.</li><li class="inGraf"> The speech went by quickly. That's because there were very few interruptions for applause. Instead of popping up to cheer every half-sentence like crazed marionettes, much of Congress sat on their hands through the speech. In fact, the Iraq section was delivered in such an uninterrupted monotone, even John McCain looked like he was nodding off.</li><li class="inGraf"> The president said the word "nookuler" only once.</li><li class="inGraf"> The evening offered evidence, at long last, that we live under a two-party system again. Not only that, the one party that's been in power these past six years is no longer in lock step &#8212; the Republicans are bickering among themselves now. Bickering is good. In fact, it even shows a little bravery! Way to be brave, Republicans!</li><li class="inGraf"> The president did not mention gay marriage, stem cell research or evolution. Hallelujah and pass the potatoes! I guess he's finished with his far-right base. After all, what can they do for him now?</li><li class="inGraf"> The president sure showed what a role model he is in staying upbeat and just talking about happy times. He made sure not to upset us by carefully avoiding any mention of the suffering of our soldiers (whom he placed in harm's way) or the plight of Katrina victims (whom he has failed to help) or the predicament of the middle class (whom he has set on the road to financial ruin). Why talk about wretched things? The stock market is up, and everyone is happy, happy, happy!</li><li class="inGraf"> Madam Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She not only made history, but she did it with class. After all, how tempting must it have been to remove one of her pumps and bonk the president on the head with it? </li><li class="inGraf"> The president said the words "climate changes." True, it's not exactly like admitting there's such a thing as global warming, but it's evidence that he's heading in the basic direction of "toward reality."</li><li class="inGraf"> The president also said the words "health insurance." OK, he's all mixed up about it and his little tiny plan would help only a little tiny handful of people, but it's the first time someone seems to have told him that his health-care system is a wreck. </li><li class="inGraf"> The president did not mention Saddam at all and he mentioned Osama just once. Of course, neither one is worth harping on any longer. After all, the one who didn't attack us has been executed, and the one who did attack us is a real sore subject because "&#166; well, you know "&#166; Bush hasn't exactly rounded him up in the cattle drive.</li><li class="inGraf"> Jim Webb. Do we have an honest, forthright politician here? Holy Real McCoy!</li><li class="inGraf"> The president further illustrated how very consistent he is. He kept saying that 9/11 had something to do with Iraq and that Baghdad will one day be just like downtown Middletown. If only the rest of America and the whole wide world would believe it, too!</li><li class="inGraf">The end of the speech was very happy and clappy. That's when the president introduced four successful Americans, knowing that everyone in the chamber would have to clap for them. It sounded kind of like all of Congress was trying to revive Tinkerbell &#8212; only not really.</li><li class="inGraf">The president finally delivered on his 2000 campaign promise that he's "a uniter, not a divider." Indeed he is. Nearly the entire Congress, the country and the world &#8212; all are now united against him
<p class="articleGraf">There are 722 days 'til Jan. 20, 2009. Hang in there, America! Especially you soldiers in Iraq. Please. Hang in there.</p>
