<p>Eleven of the 12 highest annual global
temperatures ever recorded have occurred since 1995, convincing many of
the world's leading scientists and environmentalists that global
warming has begun in earnest. </p>
<p>There are, of course, skeptics: among them, equally qualified
experts who remain unconvinced of the existence of incontrovertible
meteorological evidence that the foreseeable future will bring an
overheated planet with catastrophic flooding, health epidemics and
wildlife extinction. </p>
<p>Heat-trapping greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide released
into the atmosphere by human activity, mostly from the burning of
fossil fuels -- have long been identified as the principal catalyst
behind rising temperatures. </p>
<p>Those who argue against rushing to global warming judgment have
support from industries with a substantial stake in fossil fuels -- a
cheering section with deep pockets to spin disinformation campaigns
against the usual suspects, corporate-bashing environmental alarmists.</p>
<p>To establish a worldwide consensus on the issue, the World
Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental
Program in 1988 established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. The IPCC recently released its fourth assessment since 1990 on
the causes and consequences of climate change. </p>
<p>Drawing from the research of 2,500 scientists from more than 100
countries, the panel asserted that "warming of the climate system is
unequivocal." It further announced with 90 percent certainty that
greenhouse gases generated by human activity account for most of the
global rise in temperatures over the past half-century and, even by the
most conservative estimates, are heading towards unsustainable levels. </p>
<p>According to the IPCC, a rise of more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit
would have a devastating global impact, including large-scale melting
of ice sheets and species extinctions. The report forecasts at least a
4.5-degree Fahrenheit surge by the end of this century.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration, which routinely shrugs off
climate change warnings as long on hype but short on evidence, shows no
sign of budging from its opposition to mandatory limits on carbon
emissions and appears content to rely upon additional research aimed at
developing technological advances to address the issue.</p>

<p>While no one disputes the necessity of such research, many
scientists assert that effective technology is at least a decade away
and should not preclude immediate conservation measures. </p>
<p>The United States' response to the IPCC assessment is significant
for two reasons. First, the U.S., with only 5 percent of the world's
population, is responsible for 25 percent of the world's carbon
emissions. Secondly, if the highly industrialized United States finally
takes the issue seriously, other nations may be more inclined to follow
suit.</p>
<p>Despite increasingly louder pleas for thwarting global warming,
including calls for taxes on all carbon emissions from the largest
factories down to individual households and automobiles, chances are
there will be either no legislative action or, at best, token efforts
that will accomplish little or nothing. Moreover, even if Congress does
enact strong anti-carbon emission legislation, it remains doubtful that
the necessary two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives could be mustered to override a probable presidential
veto.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a contention that global warming is inevitable
and striving to prevent it is an exercise in futility. But if human
activity is the primary source of soaring temperatures, logic dictates
curtailment of this activity or changing the manner in which it is
pursued. And this is not a clarion call for bringing all human progress
to a screeching halt. </p>
<p>With world population now at 6.6 billion and 2.5 billion more people
projected by the middle of this century, providing effective voluntary
family planning to the tens of millions of women who lack access to it
would be a significant step towards reducing the human-generated
release of carbon dioxide -- one that obviously cannot be put on
indefinite hold. Also, while placing energy alternatives to fossil
fuels on the fast track may require temporary profit loss in some
quarters and lifestyle changes for virtually all of us -- what
sacrifice is too great in the quest to prevent global self-destruction?
</p>
<p>When even tomorrow's weather forecast often enough turns out to be
inaccurate, it is fair to question projections of the world's climate
100 years from now. But if the best scientific evidence available
overwhelmingly concludes that global warming is an "unequivocal fact,"
prudence, if nothing else, suggests that we act with all deliberate
speed to protect and preserve a planet that we do not own, but for
which we have been granted temporary stewardship.</p>
