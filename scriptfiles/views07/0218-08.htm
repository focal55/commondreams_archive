<p>Here's a good question for President's Day: what kind of executive branch did America's Constitutional framers have in mind? It's a question with which Federal Courts are now busy wrestling. And the quality of liberty American citizens enjoy very much depends on their answers.

 

<p>Today, the President's lawyers claim unlimited power to seize, indefinitely and without charges, individuals the Administration deems "enemy combatants." In two separate Appellate court cases -- one of which, Omar v Harvey was argued last week, the President's lawyers made the follwoing, remarkable claim: when international entanglements are involved, signified in the Omar case by a United Nationals Security Council resolution, US officials can detain a U.S. citizen, indefinitely. Last week, the D.C. Court of Appeals rightly -- and squarely -- rejected this remarkable, legally specious claim. It remains to be seen whether the D.C. Court of Appeals will reject a similar claim in the case of Munaf v. Harvey.

 

<p>The Framers had well-articulated trouble with the notion of freewheeling executive power. The Presidency they created, and the institution that is celebrated today, broke decisively from European traditions of monarchical absolutism.  Indeed the English tradition of government, upon which ours is modeled,  decisively rejected the King’s claim to stand above the law; that was in 1688, almost a century before the Revolution.  
 
<p>Today, we celebrate two grand leaders:  Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.  Both men understood and practiced this wisdom even in the teeth of crisis.  They understood that power flows from righteousness not from soldier’s steel.  The measure of a nation, as much as the measure of a man, is the ability to hold true under pressure to universal truths of decency and humility.
 
<p>Executive authority strains most vigorously against its constitutional restraints in times of war and in matters of human liberty.  Both Washington and Lincoln faced precisely these dilemmas, and resolved them without compromising America’s dignity or reputation.
 
<p>In the Revolutionary War, British forces acted with rank disregard for the well-being of their American prisoners, leaving literally hundreds to rot to death in insalubrious prison ships off New York’s harbors.  
 
<p>Yet General Washington would not descend to their level.  “Treat them with humanity,” said Washington in 1776 after the Battle of Trenton of British prisoners, “and let them have no reason to complain of our copying the brutal ways of the British Army in their treatment of our unfortunate brethren.”
 
<p>Our current effort to triumph over al Qaeda and the menace of terrorism  rests equally on America’s capacity to maintain the good faith and trust of a globalized world.  When our safety depends on Uzbekistan’s willingness to secure loose nukes and Indonesia’s alacrity in shutting down jihadist websites, international cooperation is at a premium.  Acting as though the international law of human rights has no application to American action, by contrast, is a surefire way to extinguish that cooperation.  
 
<p>The Civil War era provides equally important lessons.  While Lincoln famously decided in April 1861 to suspend the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus, which is the Constitution’s committed remedy for unlawful executive detention, he did not purport to stand above the law.  To the contrary, Lincoln acted only in the face of imminent and undeniable disaster, with Confederate forces looming on Washington from Virginia, and an angry Baltimore mob attacking Union troop deployments.  
 
<p>Yet as soon as crisis receded, Lincoln returned to Congress-and sought legislative blessing for the unlawful detentions.  Lincoln eloquently pled his own case to Congress, candidly revealing the causes and dimensions of the moment’s need.   And Congress duly authorized what, at the time, had been unlawful executive action.  
 
<p>The contrast to today could not be more stark.  The emergency powers the President claims have no sell-by date.  Unlike Lincoln, this President shows no readiness to be candid to Congress.  Executive detention operations from Guantanamo to Italy to Iraq have fostered the contempt of mankind.  Germany and Italy have issued warrants against CIA agents due to their involvement in the illicit kidnapping of terrorism suspects.  Just this week, Argentina’s president frankly told visiting Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that the President’s torture policies were wholly unacceptable.  
 
<p>When the nation’s leading law enforcement official becomes persona non grata around the world, we have cause for concern.  Thomas Jefferson (who is celebrated in Alabama today instead of Lincoln despite the fact his birthday falls in April) said it best in the Declaration of Independence.  The fledgling nation, Jefferson noted, had to maintain the “decent respect for the opinions of mankind.”   
 
<p>Above all, it is the President, in his respect for the due process of law and the inherent dignity of citizens and non-citizens alike, who must maintain this respect.  Today more than other any calendar date is a chance to reflect on whether this trust continues to be fulfilled.</p>
