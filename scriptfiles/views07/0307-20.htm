<p><span id="dropcap">T</span>estimony at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center yesterday by wounded soldiers who lived in moldy, cockroach- and
mouse-infested rooms, shed new light on the value the Bush
Administration places on American soldiers. Even as a new wave of young
Americans ships out for Iraq as part of the Administration's "surge,"
more revelations of disgusting and disgraceful conditions like those
revealed by the Washington Post's Walter Reed investigation are coming
to light. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501308.html" target="_new">The Post editorialized today</a>
about receiving "hundreds of accounts of appalling conditions and
management practices at both Army outpatient facilities and Department
of Veterans Affairs facilities across the country," in the wake of its
series.</div>
<p>So much for "support the troops" rhetoric. That this Administration
holds the lives of its soldiers cheap could not be more plain--first,
in sending them off to the misbegotten exercise in Iraq, then in the
President's willingness to push onward despite the deepening disaster
there, and finally in these new revelations about the care the veterans
are receiving at home.</p>

<p>Fortunately, despite initial stonewalling by the Army, Defense
Secretary Robert Gates has been willing to take an aggressive approach
to the problem, including firing Army Secretary Francis Harvey. There
is plenty more to do. Nowhere is the hypocrisy of the flag-waving
chickenhawks in the White House more glaring than in the treatment of
America's veterans.</p>
<p>As In These Times reported in a piece entitled "<a href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/comments.php?id=465_0_2_0_C" target="_new">Dishonorable Discharge</a>,"
back in 2003 "Even more than his father, and Ronald Reagan before him,
Bush is cutting budgets for myriad programs intended to protect or
improve the lives of veterans and active-duty soldiers." Among the cuts
the Administration was pushing back then were $75 a month in "imminent
danger pay" and a $150 family separation allowance, deemed by the White
House to be "wasteful and unnecessary," In These Times reported.
Democrats in Congress led the opposition to those cuts. But a Bush
budget still included $3 billion in cuts to VA hospitals. "VA spending
today averages $2,800 less per patient than nine years ago," In These
Times pointed out.</p>
<p>And if the Administration treats its own soldiers with such disdain,
the fate of the Iraqis they were sent to "save" is even more bitter. A
powerful piece by <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7695224" target="_new">Emily Harris on NPR</a>
this morning featured interviews with Iraqi refugees in Europe
describing the complete collapse of their country. As oppressive and
terrifying as life was under Saddam Hussein, it did not compare to the
complete destruction of infrastructure and violent anarchy that now
engulfs the country. Easy rhetoric about "regime change" and
democracy-building has given way to the plain reality of civil war and
social and economic collapse following the American intervention in
Iraq.</p>
<p>The human victims of the war--whether they are disabled American
veterans rotting in forgotten corridors at Walter Reed or Iraqis too
terrified to leave their homes, stranded without electricity or running
water--show what a package of bright, shining lies the Administration
has been peddling.</p>
<p>The greatest irony of Emily Harris's excellent piece is the news
that European countries, including Germany and, to the greatest degree,
Britain, are now withdrawing asylum from Iraqis who sought refuge
abroad from Saddam Hussein. Now that Hussein is gone, these countries
have concluded, the imminent danger to these Iraqis is over. Back to
Iraq they go. What awaits them there is a far cry from the new,
improved Middle East the war's planners envisioned.</p>
