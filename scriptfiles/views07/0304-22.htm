On Jan. 10, a neurosurgeon from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio "induced a brain aneurysm in a dog to demonstrate a medical device ... to a group of 20 to 25 salespeople," according to the Associated Press. The dog was later euthanized.
<p >This was non-research, purely commercial activity, intended to help eager salespeople pitch their wares, and banned by the clinic's own rules. The incident outraged animal activists, who on Feb. 17 picketed the San Jose, Calif. headquarters of Micrus Endovascular Corp., which arranged the training.</p>

<p >Appalled?</p>

<p >Then you'll be shocked to learn that the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center has since 2000 killed at least 18 dogs and 191 pigs for exactly the same kind of sales "training" for Boulder-based Valleylab. This was not research, and there was no barbecue; the carcasses were hauled off to the dump to rot.</p>

<p >But thanks to the efforts of Boulder's Rita Anderson, who works on a contract basis for California-based In Defense of Animals, CU banned such non-research vivisection on Feb. 22.</p>

<p >"The campus has decided to stop these activities because it is not part of UCDHSC's core mission. Therefore, the campus will no longer allow our facilities to be used for programs where the sole purpose is the training of sales personnel," University Counsel Steve Zweck-Bronner wrote in an e-mail to CU Regent Tom Lucero.</p>

<p >The university's decision "wasn't a coincidence," said Sarah Ellis, spokesperson for the health-sciences center. She said campus leaders were not aware of the research until Anderson exposed the unsavory program through public records.</p>

<p >Good for CU. But what else doesn't the school's leadership know about its animal research?</p>

<p >"I applaud UCDHSC for taking immediate action," Anderson said. "My concern is that we do not yet know what else is being done in the name of science and research behind the locked doors of the CU laboratories."</p>

<p >A UCDHSC staffer who assisted in anaesthetizing pigs during one session recalled that it was a jolly affair.</p>

<p >"There was a very jovial atmosphere. Everyone was joking around. (The woman) who planned the session was running around taking pictures," he said.</p>

<p >The staffer, who asked not to be named, said he's disturbed by CU's use of animals.</p>

<p >"I was told animal research was always a last resort," he said. "But I've discovered that's not really true. It's just what they do, looking for an extra way to make money, or an extra project."</p>

<p >Ellis said Valleylab, which was demonstrating electro-surgery tools, only paid for use of staff and facilities. She said the demonstrations were approved by the campus' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which "is authorized to suspend any activity involving animals if such activity is deemed inappropriate, inhumane or not in accord with the approved protocol," according to CU's Web site.</p>

<p >How, I asked Ellis, was this ever deemed appropriate? She said it fit the school's community-service mission. "It's a controlled environment where this sort of learning can take place," she said.</p>

<p >Massachusetts-based giant Tyco Healthcare, which owns Valleylab, argues that demonstration on live animals is sometimes necessary.</p>

<p >"Valleylab sponsors this training only for health-care providers who have requested it," Dr. Ned Cosgriff, medical director of clinical affairs for Tyco wrote in an e-mail. "A vital component in training to safely and effectively use sophisticated surgical tools still requires (their) use ... on living animal tissue, in order to minimize risks when those tools are used on patients."</p>

<p >Cosgriff wrote that "Valleylab</p>

<p >does not use or condone the use of live animals for any marketing or sales product demonstration."</p>

<p >Maybe Tyco is asleep at the switch, too. That assertion flatly contradicts hundreds of pages of public documents, as well as CU's own findings, which clearly state that the demos were for sales training.</p>

<p >Cosgriff also wrote, "Valleylab is always evaluating alternatives and strives to minimize the use of training with animal models whenever possible."</p>

<p >Halt the evaluation, Valleylab:</p>

<p >"There is no excuse to experiment on and kill animals for sales purposes. Non-animal alternatives are readily available and effective," said Holly Mattern, a spokesperson with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "The American College of Surgeons and medical-device manufacturer Applied Medical have implemented policies against using animals in their training sessions already."</p>

<p >The use of animals even for legitimate medical research is often gratuitous. For sales, it's inexcusable. Research institutions like CU are getting that message.</p>

<p >But if we, as a culture, can't see that things like vivisection simply to boost sales, and cramming highly intelligent pigs into tiny crates for their entire lives are immoral, what does that say about us? Meat eaters aren't going to suddenly give up hamburgers, but they can pay slightly more to buy only humanely raised meat. Fashionistas can go faux rather than wear the bloody, vain evidence of our inhumanity toward animals.</p>


<p >So thank you, CU, for doing the right thing. And Valleylab? Give PETA a call. They can help.</p>
