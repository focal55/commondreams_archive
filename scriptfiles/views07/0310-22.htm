<p>On many occasions, President George W. Bush has lectured the American 
people that "amidst all this violence and bloodshed" in Iraq, "is the 
sacrifice worth it? It is worth it, and it is vital to the security of 
our country.

<p>Well then, why don't his daughters, 25 year olds Barbara and Jenna join 
the armed services and share in the sacrifice? Or is the sacrifice only 
to be borne overwhelmingly by lower-income whites, Hispanics and 
African-Americans who comprise the bulk of the casualties?

<p>Mr. Bush is constantly speechifying to the American people, and 
increasingly failing to secure their support. Nearly 70 percent of 
Americans want out of Iraq and believe it was not worth the price. 
Americans may be wondering why neither Bush, nor Cheney, nor the 
neocons, who fabricated the causes for invading Iraq, nor the corporate 
bosses raking in war profits - why neither they nor their families are 
showing any signs of sacrifice?

<p>By contrast, across the Atlantic Ocean in England, the British Defense 
Ministry announced last month that "His Royal Highness Prince Harry will 
deploy to Iraq later this year." Harry, age 22, is a second lieutenant 
who insists on going to Iraq with the soldiers under his command.

<p>"There's no way I'm going to put myself through Sandhurst (the military 
academy), and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out 
fighting for their country," he told a television interviewer.

<p>It is not as if Prince Harry is a stern, militant young fellow. /The New 
York Times/ called him "something of a playboy prince," who frequents 
"London's more exclusive nightclubs."

<p>Jenna and Barbara like to go out on the town as well. /The Washington 
Post/ reported in early January that the twins went out "with a 
well-heeled entourage - crushed velvet sport coats for the men, trendy 
leggings, silk dresses and platform heels for the women," before Barbara 
heads back "to New York and her job at the Cooper-Hewitt museum" and 
Jenna returns "to her UNICEF gig in Central America."

<p>The old nineteen sixties phrase, "if you're not part of the risk, you 
won't be part of the solution" applies to the Bush family. It's even 
worse. Some of Bush's relatives are involved in the war business, making 
money from their participation in companies and firms thriving off 
Defense Department contracts. (See Democracyrising.us)

<p>Himself an adroit avoider of the Vietnam era draft, using his 
connections to enlist in the Texas Air National Guard that was not 
slated to embark for southeast Asia, George W. Bush finds solace in 
saying that he is "in awe of the men and women who sacrifice for the 
freedom of the United States of America, who volunteer to confront our 
adversaries abroad so we do not have to face them here at home."

<p>With such an awe-inspiring mission in Iraq to which he and Cheney have 
tied our country, its soldiers and its strained budget of billions of 
dollars, one might imagine George and Laura having a fireside chat in 
the White House with their able and spirited daughters about joining 
this noble Iraq mission in uniform.

<p>Imagine further what Privates Jenna and Barbara would have to tell a 
President known for his traits of not listening and not admitting any 
mistakes (note the bungling Iraq occupation, the post-Katrina debacles 
and the recent Walter Reed deprivations which are never the fault of 
this no-fault Commander in Chief).

<p>Let's envision the twins back on leave as medics from their first 
deployment to Baghdad sitting with father in the family quarters 
upstairs in the White House.

<p>Jenna - "Daddy, you must listen to us and not ignore what we want to 
say, as you have disregarded our e-mails. Most of our soldiers in Iraq 
have lost faith and want the U.S. out of there. If you don't believe me, 
look at this year old Zogby poll reporting 72 percent of the soldiers 
want the U.S. out in six months to a year. And things are much worse now."

<p>Barbara - "Daddy, you're spending $12 million an hour in Iraq and the 
soldiers are still short of body armor, armored vehicles and 
communications equipment. Still! Four years after the war started. Much 
of their equipment needs repair or replacement and there is no money. 
One of your Congressional critics reacting to the Department of 
Defense's Inspector General report of January 2007 said: "If our troops 
aren't the priority, who is? Halliburton, Blackwater, other corporate 
chums of the President?"

<p>The President - "Reports, polls, what nonsense; what are your soldier 
friends fighting courageously over there against those hit and run 
cowards telling you?"

<p>Barbara - "Some were too ripped up in the hospitals to tell us, but we 
knew they were torn apart by IEDs in their unprotected vehicles. We can 
tell you other horrible eye-witness stories about undertrained and 
underequipped national guardsmen and reservists. It won't inspire you, 
but we can tell you, if you wish. We're on the receiving end of the 
battered men and women who come to us on stretchers."

<p>The President - "Don't bother, Barbara, Jenna, it all keeps me and Laura 
up at night, worrying so about you. I hear you. I hear you."

<p>If you agree that having Jenna and Barbara join the armed forces will 
help bring George W. Bush closer to bringing the soldiers home and 
ending this boomeranging war-occupation, express you support to:
