<p>The right-wing isn’t known for its creativity or subtlety, either in humor or in insult. In fact, it relies on overt distortion to make points – to pretend that its rivals are for terrorists, or are anti-American, or are soft on crime. Of course, if policies are viewed with an eye toward results, it can be reasonably be said that the Bush Republicans favor a weaker military, want to promote breeding grounds for terrorists and support the indebtedness of the United States to totalitarian states such as Saudi Arabia and China. Oh, and they also supported Saddam before it was cool to see him hanged. 
<p>It shouldn’t be surprising that this lack of ingenuity shows up among right-wingers in directly attacking their rivals. One of their most pointed — and in many senses, most puzzling — jibes at the Democratic Party is to drop the “ic” and simply call it the “Democrat Party.” One supposes that the dropping of the suffix is meant to imply that the party isn’t “democratic,” but is merely Democrat. That’s a rather weak insult, but it serves to address the base instincts of the Republican base — why make an argument when name-calling is available?
<p>“Democrat Party” is also supposed to connote partisanship, one supposes — partisanship on the part of the Democrats, that is, absent of any commitment to “democratic” ideals. Yet the irony here is that is the Republicans — let’s get in on the fun and call them the Republicrats — who are most against the ideals that they themselves claim to favor.
<p>Take the ongoing comparison to the Iraq War with that of World War II. What if, say the Republicrats, we had had the same kind of dissent fighting Hitler as have about the Iraq War today — why, we would have lost the war! Well, hey, here’s the funny thing — we did have dissent about World War II: it came from the Republicrats, led by the right-wingers and the isolationist Lindbergh, anti-Semitic, closet Nazi supporters who apparently wanted to see Europe burn while we stood by and did nothing. 
<p>The Republicrats are also responsible for switching positions with the old Democrats, later the Dixiecrats, who used racism and race-baiting for generations after the Civil War to mount an unholy political alliance between the aristocratic Southern planting class and the poor whites to solidify Southern Democratic rule for a hundred years. That ended after LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act, and who was there to fill the void? Yup, it was the Republicrats, and now the South is solidly Republicrat. They have used the alliance of rich whites with poor whites in a not-so-subtle “us-vs.-them” argument that allows them to exploit queer bashing, undercover racism, and ridicule of science and “book learnin’,” while promoting economic, health care and foreign policies that are actually against the interests of the white majority. The Republicrats knew a good thing when they saw it in their fellow Dixiecrats. Republicrats Trent Lott, Bill Frist, Jim DeMint, Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms and many, many others are heir to the old Dixiecrat coalition. 
<p>Come to think of it, the Republicrat moniker isn't an insult. It's an apt characterization when one considers how it evokes the notion of aristocratic rule with the support of the less wealthy classes. It also recalls the movie “The Aristocrats,” in which comedians recount their versions of the most disgusting joke imaginable. The trouble is, this is no joke. The Republicrats take themselves so seriously, they can’t see the irony in their own joke about the “Democrat” Party, and they can’t see the damage of policies that are neither Republican nor Democratic – the policies of the Republicrats.
