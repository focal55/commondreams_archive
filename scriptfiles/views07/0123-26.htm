<p>If ever proof was needed that the president's
 "surge"
 plan in Iraq is actually a ruse, a guise for
 something
 else, it came yesterday.
 
<p>Five American soldiers were killed when a group of
 Iraqis dressed in American army uniforms penetrated
 a
 secure government compound in the Baghdad suburb of
 Karbala.  The insurgents drove an armored GMC SUV -
 standard US government issue - through multiple
 checkpoints to enter the compound, one of the most
 protected areas in Iraq.
 
<p>Once inside, they drove directly to a building
 housing
 security officials planning counter-insurgency
 activity.  They opened fire on a meeting in
 progress,
 targeting only Americans.  After 20 minutes of
 exchanged gunfire, the attackers got back in their
 SUV
 and drove away.  Iraqi officials noted that the
 attack
 was striking for the sophistication of its planning
 and execution.
 
<p> Amid all the carnage and chaos that is Iraq, why is
 this attack noteworthy?  And what does it say about
 the plausibility of the president's "surge"
 strategy?
 
<p>The attack is noteworthy because it mirrors some of
 the reasons for failure of the American war in
 Vietnam.  Simply put, the US could never get the
 Army
 of South Vietnam (ARVN) to carry the burden in
 fighting the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese
 Army.
 That is why in 1965 Lyndon Johnson decided that if
 the
 war was to be won, he would have to pour in hundreds
 of thousands of US troops to do the fighting
 themselves.
 
<p> The reasons for ARVN's refusal to fight were
 straightforward.  They perfectly presage the
 problems
 with the Iraqi army today.
 
<p>First, many of the soldiers in the South Vietnamese
 Army were themselves either indifferent or even
 hostile to the U.S. presence in Vietnam.  They saw
 the
 damage the war inflicted on their country and wanted
 the U.S. to leave.  They took every opportunity -
 sometimes passive, sometimes active - to sabotage
 their government's cooperation with the Americans.
 
<p>Second, because promotion in the army was based not
 on
 experience or leadership but rather on loyalty,
 corruption, or family connections, the quality of
 the
 officer corps was exceptionally poor.  Soldiers
 refused to put their lives at risk under the
 direction
 of inexperienced, cowardly, or corrupt officers.
 They
 routinely failed to show up for important missions
 and
 showed no initiative in the field, holding back
 under
 fire to avoid injury or death.
 
<p> Finally and most importantly, the whole of the army
 (and the civilian bureaucracy as well) had been
 infiltrated by the Viet Cong.  As a consequence,
 army
 maneuvers were routinely disclosed to the enemy
 before
 they ever began.  This made it a near certainty that aggressive
 operations would be ambushed, that fighting
 would be fierce, and that losses would be high.  
 
<p> The U.S. military understood this infiltration well.
 
<p>Thus, whenever possible, to preserve its own element
 of surprise and protect its own forces, the U.S kept
 ARVN out of the loop of planning for field
 operations.
 
 
<p>All of these conditions apply literally unchanged in
 Iraq.  When over 80% of the population want the
 Americans to leave, when more than 60% believe it is acceptable to
 target Americans, it is quite literally
 impossible to constitute an army that does not
 contain
 much of the same poisoned sentiment.  
 
<p>And when jobs are obtained by tribal or sectarian connections, and
 when the job is more a matter of a paycheck than of putting your life 
 on the line, it is
 inevitable that discipline and ardor will be weak.  
 
<p>And the greatest vulnerability, of course, is
 infiltration.  When everything the U.S. does - from
 getting food on the mess tables to the logistics of ammunition, fuel,
 and weapons transport - depends on the goodwill and assistance of 
 Iraqis, the mission is
 already lost.  For it only takes one infiltrator to
 doom a patrol, to sabotage a firefight, to pass
 killers through checkpoints as friends.  
 
<p>  All of this is very well known to commanding
 officers
 in Iraq, all of whom have studied the reasons for
 U.S.
 failure in Vietnam.  This is why the U.S. army
 refuses
 to provide any more weapons to the Iraqi army:  they
 know they will just end up in the hands of hostile insurgents, the way
 the uniforms and SUV did in the firefight yesterday.  The same thing 
 happened in Vietnam.  A 1967 study in the field revealed that
 36%
 of weapons captured from Viet Cong soldiers were of
 American manufacture.  
 
<p> But if the U.S. cannot trust those it is training to
 take over the fighting, if it will not provide them
 the arms to take over the fighting, what are the
 odds
 they will be able to, in fact, take over the
 fighting?
  Of course, they are zero.  For that is not really
 the
 plan.
 
<p> The "surge" plan has always been a fraud.  If, as
 president Bush has claimed, loss in Iraq would be "catastrophic for
 the U.S." does 21,000 troops begin to rise to the level of the 
 purported threat? Before
 the war began, General Eric Shinseki told Donald
 Rumsfeld it would take 500,000 to 600,000 troops to
 secure the country.  There are now 140,000 U.S.
 troops
 in Iraq and the bedlam vastly exceeds what it was
 going in.  Can raising the troop level to 161,000
 now
 possibly make any difference?  It is patently a
 sham. 
  
 
<p>Whatever the "surge" is really for - whether it's to
 support an attack on Iran or just a cynical ploy to
 not "lose" the war on Bush's watch - it is clearly
 not
 about winning.  We need to end the charade and
 demand
 an immediate reversal before the escalation becomes
 worse.
