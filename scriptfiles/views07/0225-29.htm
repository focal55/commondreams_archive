The chief architects of Pentagon-di rected disaster in Iraq
are gone. 
<P> Donald ("the Army you have") Rumsfeld has left
the building. </P>
<P> So has his deputy, Paul (Iraq can "finance its own
reconstruction") Wolfowitz. </P>
<P> Their policy undersecretary Doug ("how a transition
would occur is not known precisely") Feith was just
raked for goosing prewar intelligence. </P>
<P> Former viceroy Paul ("I never heard back from him
about the report") Bremer is home and busily trying to
spread the blame. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Vice President Dick ("we will, in fact, be
greeted as liberators") Cheney is circling the globe,
spreading more disinformation prior to possible war with
Iran. </P>
<P> Yet there's one bad penny who just keeps coming up,
and up and up: Ahmad Chalabi, the wily Iraqi exile banker
who cozied up to Iranian intelligence under the very nose of
the CIA and then helped land us in war with Iraq through
intelligence misinformation. </P>

<P> Incredibly, Chalabi now is in charge of the Iraqi
government's civilian liaison for the
"surge." </P>
<P> He's Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's new
right-hand man -- a role that should give every planner at
the Pentagon pause -- running what the Wall Street Journal
calls the "popular committee for mobilizing the
people." </P>
<P> Mobilizing is one thing Chalabi really knows how to do. He
"mobilized" Feith, Wolfowitz, Bremer and Rumsfeld
into their most fateful occupation errors -- disbanding the
Iraqi army and firing all Baathists. </P>
<P> No matter that such purges were in direct contravention of
White House-approved policy that rightly saw preserving the
army as key to law and order and limiting Baathist firings
as essential to moving the economy forward. </P>
<P> Chalabi was more interested in promoting himself and the
exclusivist Shiite agenda that was key to his attempted
power grab. Among the first to be fired were thousands of
teachers. </P>
<P> No wonder Iraqi voters rejected Chalabi. </P>

<P> Yet it turns out this bad penny never was returned to the
bank. </P>
<P> Behind the scenes, Chalabi continued
"mobilizing" -- through frequent trips to Iran. </P>
<P> And laws to reinstate Sunnis to their jobs languished
because Chalabi still runs the government's
de-Baathification committee. </P>
<P> Actually, it should be no surprise that such a man -- who
was able to con the U.S. military into airlifting himself
and his handpicked army into Iraq in 2003 so they could
seize enough of Saddam Hussein's old intelligence files
to become rich and powerful -- would remain at the center of
influence. </P>
<P> What's worrying is what this tells us about the
al-Maliki government. </P>
<P> Chalabi's prominence says that Iran doesn't have
to be invited into Iraq. It's already there. </P>

<P> Chalabi's dual games with the CIA and Iranian
intelligence go back at least to March 3, 1995. </P>
<P> That was the date, according to a recent Senate
Intelligence Committee report, when Chalabi met privately
with Iranian intelligence agents trying to entice them to
intervene in a planned anti-Saddam uprising. Stationing a
CIA representative just outside the meeting, Chalabi
apparently lied to the Iranian agents about having White
House support for involving Iranian-backed mujahedeen in the
uprising. </P>
<P> U.S. intelligence officials went ballistic when enough
information filtered back to Washington to suggest what
Chalabi had done. </P>
<P> To the CIA, he became persona non grata. </P>
<P> Yet during later Iraq war planning, Pentagon officials
pooh-poohed the idea that Chalabi could be untrustworthy. </P>
<P> Chalabi may not be a direct arm of Iranian interests in
Iraq. He's too interested in his own power. </P>

<P> Yet he's a connoisseur of power grabs Iraqi-style,
for which Iran holds the trump card for Shiites. </P>
<P> And today, this slippery go-between sits on the shoulder
of the very Iraqi government for whose legitimacy and
longevity U.S. forces are being sent to fight and die. </P>
<P> Somehow, that seems as backward and as wrong as the war
itself. </P>
