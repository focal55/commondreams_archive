Something remarkable is going on in a Miami courtroom. The cruel methods
US interrogators have used since September 11 to "break" prisoners are
finally being put on trial.

<p>

This was not supposed to happen. The Bush Administration's plan was to
put Jos&eacute; Padilla on trial for allegedly being part of a network
linked to international terrorists. But Padilla's lawyers are arguing
that he is not fit to stand trial because he has been driven insane by
the government. 
</p>
<p>

Arrested in May 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare airport, Padilla, a
Brooklyn-born former gang member, was classified as an "enemy combatant"
and taken to a Navy prison in Charleston, South Carolina. He was kept in
a 9-by-7-foot cell with no natural light, no clock and no calendar.
Whenever Padilla left the cell, he was shackled and suited in heavy
goggles and headphones. Padilla was kept under these conditions for
1,307 days. He was forbidden contact with anyone but his interrogators,
who punctured the extreme sensory deprivation with sensory overload,
blasting him with harsh lights and pounding sounds. Padilla also says he
was injected with a "truth serum," a substance his lawyers believe was
LSD or PCP.
</p>
<p>

According to his lawyers and two mental health specialists who examined
him, Padilla has been so shattered that he lacks the ability to assist
in his own defense. He is convinced that his lawyers are "part of a
continuing interrogation program" and sees his captors as protectors. In
order to prove that "the extended torture visited upon Mr. Padilla has
left him damaged," his lawyers want to tell the court what happened
during those years in the Navy brig. The prosecution strenuously
objects, maintaining that "Padilla is competent," that his treatment is
irrelevant. 
</p>
<p>

US District Judge Marcia Cooke disagrees. "It's not like Mr. Padilla was
living in a box. He was at a place. Things happened to him at that
place." The judge has ordered several prison employees to testify at the
hearings on Padilla's mental state, which begin February 22. They will
be asked how a man alleged to have engaged in elaborate antigovernment
plots now acts, in the words of brig staff, "like a piece of furniture."

</p>
<p>

It's difficult to overstate the significance of these hearings. The
techniques used to break Padilla have been standard operating procedure
at Guant&aacute;namo Bay since the first prisoners arrived five years
ago. They wore blackout goggles and sound-blocking headphones and were
placed in extended isolation, interrupted by strobe lights and heavy
metal music. These same practices have been documented in dozens of
cases of CIA "extraordinary rendition" as well as in prisons in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
</p>
<p>

Many have suffered the same symptoms as Padilla. According to James Yee,
former Army Muslim chaplain at Guant&aacute;namo, there is an entire
section of the prison called Delta Block for detainees who have been
reduced to a delusional state. "They would respond to me in a childlike
voice, talking complete nonsense. Many of them would loudly sing
childish songs, repeating the song over and over." All of Delta Block
was on twenty-four-hour suicide watch. 
</p>
<p>

Human Rights Watch has exposed a US-run detention facility near
Kabul known as the "prison of darkness"--tiny pitch-black cells, strange
blaring sounds. "Plenty lost their minds," one former inmate recalled.
"I could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the
doors." 
</p>
<p>

These standard mind-breaking techniques have never faced scrutiny in a
US court because the prisoners in the jails are foreigners and have been
stripped of the right of habeas corpus--a denial that, scandalously, was
just upheld by a federal appeals court in Washington, DC. There is only
one reason Padilla's case is different: He is a US citizen. The
Administration did not originally intend to bring Padilla to trial, but
when his status as an enemy combatant faced a Supreme Court challenge,
the Administration abruptly changed course, charging Padilla and
transferring him to civilian custody. That makes Padilla's case unique:
He is the only victim of the post-9/11 legal netherworld to face an
ordinary US trial.
</p>
<p>

Now that Padilla's mental state is the central issue in the case, the
government prosecutors have a problem. The CIA and the military have
known since the early 1960s that extreme sensory deprivation and sensory
overload cause personality disintegration--that's the whole point. "The
deprivation of stimuli induces regression by depriving the subject's
mind of contact with an outer world and thus forcing it in upon itself.
At the same time, the calculated provision of stimuli during
interrogation tends to make the regressed subject view the interrogator
as a father-figure." That comes from <i>Kubark Counterintelligence
Interrogation</i>, a 1963 declassified CIA manual for interrogating
"resistant sources." 
</p>

<p>

The manual was based on the findings of the agency's notorious MK Ultra
program, which in the 1950s funneled about $25 million to scientists to
research "unusual techniques of interrogation." One of the
psychiatrists who received CIA funding was the infamous Ewen Cameron of
Montreal's McGill University. Cameron subjected hundreds of psychiatric
patients to large doses of electroshock and total sensory isolation and
drugged them with LSD and PCP. In 1960 Cameron gave a lecture at the
Brooks Airforce Base in Texas in which he stated that sensory
deprivation "produces the primary symptoms of schizophrenia." 
</p>
<p>

There is no need to go so far back to prove that the US military knew
full well that it was driving Padilla mad. The Army's field manual,
reissued just last year, states, "Sensory deprivation may result in
extreme anxiety, hallucinations, bizarre thoughts, depression, and
anti-social behavior," as well as "significant psychological
distress." 
</p>
<p>

If these techniques drove Padilla insane, that means the US government
has been deliberately driving hundreds, possibly thousands, of prisoners
insane around the world. What is on trial in Florida is not one man's
mental state. It is the whole system of US psychological torture.
