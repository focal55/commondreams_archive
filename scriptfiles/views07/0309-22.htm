Since the beginning of the Green Revolution five decades ago, the 
standard line from industry and government has been: "We need industrial 
agriculture to feed the world." The producers of chemical pesticides, 
herbicides, and fertilizers; the designers and patent owners of hybrid 
and genetically-engineered seeds; the farm machinery suppliers; the 
shipping conglomerates that control the flow of food; and the 
governmental and non-governmental food policy makers have all been in 
agreement about their great beneficence. Sure they make billions of 
dollars and control the food supply, but don't worry, it's for our own 
good. In fact, they're doing us a favor. Without high-tech advancements 
in food production, aka "progress", food would cost too much and poor 
people throughout the world would remain hungry because, their logic 
apparently concludes, they can't very well feed themselves.</P>
<P>
In their December 9, 2006 piece <em>Good Food?</em>, the <em>Economist</em> wrote:</P>
<blockquote>
<i>&quot;Following the "green revolution" of the 1960s greater use of 
chemical fertiliser has tripled grain yields with very little increase 
in the area of land under cultivation.&quot;  &quot;Organic methods, which rely 
on crop rotation, manure and compost in place of fertiliser, are far 
less intensive. So producing the world's current agricultural output 
organically would require several times as much land as is currently 
cultivated. There wouldn't be much room left for the rainforest.&quot;</i></blockquote>
<P>
The argument about higher yields on industrial farms is rooted in an 
industrial mindset that quantifies as a rule and leaves the qualifying 
for the liberal arts majors. With respect to industrial farming, the 
logic goes like this: If you're looking to maximize production of a 
given commodity, like corn, the highest yield per acre will come from 
planting vast acres of genetically-engineered or hybrid seed, applying 
chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, and employing heavy 
machinery in the planting and harvesting. The yield from an acre of corn 
produced this way will always beat the yield of an acre of heirloom corn 
planted by hand and fertilized by healthy soil and compost. Or so we're 
told.</P>
<P>
The longest running study comparing organic and non-organic 
("conventional") farming systems, the Rodale Institute Farming Systems 
Trial, found yields to be comparable. Not only were yields similar with 
the organic methods, and in some cases higher, the reduction in fossil 
fuel use and pollution and the increased soil health made 
organically-managed systems the clear winner. Perhaps the most important 
finding was that "In the drought years, 1988 to 1998, corn yields in the 
legume-based system were 22 percent higher than yields in the 
conventional system." In a world experiencing water shortages and 
drought, this is good to know.</P>
<P>
Research conducted by the Institute for Food and Development Policy, or 
Food First, has found that throughout the world smaller, diversified 
farming systems are upwards of 1000% more productive in terms of the 
overall amount of food produced than large scale industrial farms. 
According to these findings, if we transitioned to a world of 
knowledgeable small-scale food producers, we could in fact <em>reduce</em> the 
amount of land that is currently being used to grow food. And we would 
save the rain forest. And we would preserve traditional agriculture and 
indigenous communities. And we would protect the health of the lands, 
the waterways, and the farmworkers caught in the crossfire of chemical 
agriculture's reign of terror.</P>
<P>
So if your goal is to produce a variety of highly nutritious foods in a 
way that sustains the land, your community, and your culture, then 
well-managed small farms are clearly the way to go. This is common 
knowledge among small-scale farmers, gardeners, and homesteaders, but 
apparently not readily known to the folks at the <em>Economist</em>. Might I 
suggest to the author(s) of <em>Good Food?</em> a summer apprenticeship on an 
organic farm?</P>
<P>
While it is true that the Green Revolution has tripled world-wide grain 
production, the vast majority of that increase is going to feed cows, 
pigs, and chickens in horribly cruel Confined Animal Feeding Operations 
(CAFO's), or what we commonly know as factory farms, who are turn in 
processed into beef patties, breakfast sausage, and chicken nuggets to 
feed the appetites of an affluent fast-food culture. This is just one of 
the nasty outgrowths of the Green Revolution: the wide-spread, 
systematic torture of billions of animals each year.</P>
<P>
Factory farms are also an ecological nightmare. Hog farms in North 
Carolina, for example, create about 19 million tons of waste a year, 
more than the amount of human waste created by New York, Los Angeles, 
Chicago, and Atlanta combined. Wendell Berry keenly observed that when 
we took animals off the farm and began confining them in feedlots and 
factory farms we took a perfectly good solution (animals eating 
perennial grass and bugs while distributing their natural fertilizer 
throughout fields) and created two new problems: the loss of fertilizer 
for farms and the pollution that results from having all that 
drug-riddled shit in one place. Another obvious problem is the amount of 
time, fossil fuels, and crop lands that are being devoted to raising 
animals in this way.</P>
<P>
Then there is all the corn that is turned into sweeteners, plastics, and 
increasingly, fuel for our cars. Surely if the reason for chemicalizing, 
industrializing, centralizing, and genetically modifying our food supply 
is to feed the world, then the benevolent folks at Cargill, Archer 
Daniels Midland, ConAgra, Monsanto, the World Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the U.S. Treasury must 
be working day and night to ensure that all people are fed before 
converting coveted grain into soft-drinks, take-out containers, and 
gasoline. Surely.</P>
<P>
Take ethanol as one example of Big Food's insincerity. According to the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, 18 to 20 percent of the total U.S. corn 
crop will be diverted to the production of ethanol; By next year it will 
be 25 percent. The demand for ethanol has driven the price of corn up by 
nearly 70% in the last six months, sending shock waves through the food 
system. In Mexico, the price of tortillas has tripled since November. In 
the U.S. the price of corn-based chicken feed has risen 15 percent. 
Clearly those who are already hungry or marginalized by a market-based 
food system are going to be most affected by this diversion of food for 
fuel. The folks who will be most harmed are the same folks Big Food 
claims to be working for.</P>
<P>
When an agribusiness executive says his or her company is in the 
business of feeding the world, he or she is lying. Regardless of the 
personal inclinations of agribusiness executives, as publicly-held 
corporations (excluding privately-owned Cargill) they are mandated by 
law to maximize profit for their shareholders, not to give away their 
"product" to starving peasants. Anything said to the contrary is just a 
marketing gimmick designed to get you to buy their product.</P>
<P>
If you can't pay, then you don't eat. That's their business.
