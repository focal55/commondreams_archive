<p>Defying the vast majority of the American public and top military leaders, the president of the United States is about to announce an escalation of his failed war in Iraq. 

<p>It appears to many that it comes down to the president’s not wanting the failure of the Iraq war to occur on his watch, that the images of Americans being evacuated from the Green Zone be reserved for his successor in the White House. Without the character and fortitude to accept a difficult reality, the president has decided to prolong the agony with the commitment of additional US troops.  This would mean that thousands more of our soldiers and innocent Iraqis will die for a failed policy, a character flaw and a cynical political calculation.

<p>What is astonishing is that the president might actually get away with it. Some in Congress, like Senators McCain and Graham, have launched a vigorous public campaign to support the president’s escalation. Others, like Senator Biden, believe that there is nothing that Congress can do about it. 

<p>That leaves a fed up American public, who issued a mandate in November for political leaders to start bringing our troops home, with only one option – hit the streets. We can begin this week 24 hours after the president announces his escalation. 

<p>The Win Without War Coalition, <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org" target="_new">www.winwithoutwarus.org</a>, and allied groups opposed to the war are urging Americans to flock to their town squares, churches, synagogues, neighborhood centers and parks 24 hours after the president announces his escalation of the war. They can sign up and learn more by going to the web site <a href="http://www.americasaysno.org" target="_new">www.americasaysno.org</a> hosted by Win Without War member True Majority. Those gathered will pause to recognize soldiers from their state who have lost their lives in Iraq. They will take a group photo of themselves and their answer to the president’s escalation of the war with a simple and clear message: “NO!” The photos will be sent to their local newspaper and to campaign web site: <a href="http://www.americasaysno.org" target="_new">www.americasaysno.org</a>. where participants will be able to watch the response come in from neighborhoods throughout the country. Many will make a short video – “Why We Are Saying NO in 30 Seconds” and upload it on the web site and YouTube. 

<p>This will mark the beginning of a series of public actions against the war including a march in the nation’s capitol on January 27 organized by United for Peace and Justice and a national “Meet Up With Members” in the district offices of Representatives and Senators during the first Congressional District Work period of the new Congress.

<p>Voters took to the polls in November to demand that the government start bringing our troops home. A recent CNN poll indicates only one in ten Americans support sending more troops to Iraq.  Fewer than a third of Americans support the war, with a clear majority saying that they want U.S. troops out of Iraq within a year. Before the November Congressional elections, Americans told pollsters that if the Democrats won they expected Congress to end the war.
<p>Here is what General John Abizaid, our top commander in Iraq and the region, told the Senate Armed Services Committee a few weeks ago: "I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps commander, General Dempsey… And I said… if we were to bring in more American troops now, does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no." 

<p>Last month US soldiers stationed in Baghdad told the Associated Press that the city "is embroiled in civil warfare" between Shiites and Sunnis that "no number of American troops can stop." They worried that "dispatching a new wave of soldiers would result in more U.S. casualties," and questioned whether "an increasingly muddled American mission in Baghdad is worth putting more lives on the line."
<p>There are, of course, options to the president’s military escalation. Most sober analysts – and the majority of Americans - agree that there is no military solution to the conflict in Iraq, only a political one. The United States needs to work with regional governments, including Iran and Syria, to achieve reconciliation in Iraq. In a recent poll conducted by the University of Maryland, 82% of Democrats and 72% of Republicans said we should directly engage with Syria and Iran to establish a political solution in Iraq, as was unanimously recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. 

<p>The fate of our troops and any hope for turning around the disaster in Iraq now rests clearly with us. Whether or not Congress will allow the president to get away with his attempt to “double-down” his failed gamble in Iraq will depend on a clear and robust rejection by the American people.  

<p>When President Richard Nixon announced in April of 1970 that he would escalate the Vietnam War by invading Cambodia, Americans reacted with shock and disbelief. Protests erupted throughout the country, and Congress later banned US troops from operating in Cambodia and Laos. Today, more of the American public, including top military brass, is against this war and President Bush's proposed escalation than was opposed to the Vietnam War in 1970.

<p>It is time for an American surge to stop the Bush war in Iraq. We can begin this week with a simple and clear message: Mr. President, Members of Congress, read our lips: “NO!”

<p><b>America Says NO
More Troops!<br>
An Action Guide for A Nationwide Surge of Protest
Of The US Military Occupation of Iraq </b>
<p><b><i>What it is<br>
</i></b>
President Bush is expected to reveal his "new strategy” for Iraq in an address to the nation on or around Wednesday January 10th.  Defying the mandate of Americans who voted in November to end the madness and begin to bring our troops home, the judgment of military leaders and even former Secretary of State Colin Powell, the president is expected to call for an increase in the number of US combat troops in Iraq. 

<p>We think it is crucial that Americans deliver an immediate and direct response to the president’s call for an escalation of the Iraq war: NO! 

<p>Volunteers will host actions in cities and towns across the country within 24 hours of the president’s speech with a simple message: "America says NO more troops in Iraq!” The message will be directed to the president and the newly elected Congress. The goal of the event is to generate media attention of the strong and growing nationwide sentiment against the President's proposal and strengthen the resolve of members of Congress to work for an end to the war. It will kick-off a series of actions that will build public awareness and opposition to the war over the next several weeks.

<p>Groups will gather in well-lighted, convenient locations to be part of a “national family photo” of Americans who say NO to the president’s war in Iraq. The digital photos will be released to the local media, uploaded to this web site and displayed with hundreds of others from across the nation as they come in from communities from east to west. Participants will be invited to record a video message to their member of Congress that will be uploaded to the site and YouTube. Each gathering will read the names of soldiers from their state who have been killed in Iraq, circulate and sign a national petition to be hand-delivered to Congress and sign up for actions that are being organized in Washington, DC and in their community.

<p><b><i>How to Join In</i></b>
<p>“America Says No” events will be simple and easy to host.

<p><b>Community Coordinator Action Guide
</b>
<p>First and foremost, THANKS for being willing to coordinate your local America Says NO! event. You are part of a team of coordinators, in cities and towns across America, who are making this action possible. Welcome to the team!

<p><b><i>Here is a checklist of what to do to make your event a success:
</i></b>
<p><b>BEFORE THE EVENT:
</b>
<p><b>1)	Identify and recruit a team of people to work with.</b> Community leaders, organizers and those with experience in putting on local events are key;

<p><b>2)	Pick a time for the event</b> (we've found that 6 or 7 pm usually works best, but it's up to you.) Then pick a location for people to gather. Make sure it's well lit (the sun goes down early at this time of year) and easy for others to find. Choose a safe, visible location in a public space. If it can be arranged, an inside location such as a public hall, community building, church or synagogue would be ideal for those living in colder climes;

<p><b>3)	Reach out to your community.</b> Working with your team, identify every conceivable way people in your community can be reached and encouraged to attend your event. How do people in your community get their information? You might start with everyone sending personal e-mails to their web-mail list asking that their friends, colleagues and relatives to do the same; call leaders of local groups, religious institutions and networks and ask them to ask their members and colleagues to participate; distribute flyers (you can download a sample on the site); and put up posters; 

<p><b>4)	Put out a news advisory</b> (download our media kit) to your local media; ask those with experience with your local media who and how to reach key reporters, producers and editorial board members. Invite your local newspaper, television and radio stations to the event beforehand. This is easy -- simply send them the sample press advisory provided in the organizer kit, and follow it up with a phone call reminding them about your event. They'll appreciate this – it's the main way that newspapers and news crews find stories to cover every day.

<p><b>5)	Recruit speakers to help facilitate the event.</b> Leaders from diverse local community groups and religious institutions are ideal;

<p><b>6)	Make sure to capture the event with a photo. </b>Recruit a volunteer with a digital camera who can shoot still photos and videos that can be downloaded to the website.

<p><b>7)	If possible, enlarge the NO!  You can use the “NO!” JPEG on the web site to make larger signs and banners for the event. </b>
<p><b>AT THE EVENT
</b>
<p><b>Before the Program </b>
<p>Show up to the site early. Put up signs or banners. If you have a small public address system, set up the microphone where you want the speakers speak.  As people arrive, invite them to participate by passing around a one-page fact sheet (available on this web site) and the list of casualties from your area. You may want to ask some participants to read aloud the names during the program. You might ask others to pass the petitions around and collect them at the end of the event.

<p><b>The Program
</b>
<p><b>1)  Welcome and Introductions:
</b>
<p>Thank everyone for coming and state simply why you are all there. [Download our “talking points” page for suggestions.] Talk about the events and actions that will follow including the March on Washington, January 27; Lobby Day at the nation’s Capitol on January 29; and “Meet-Up With Your Member” week starting on Tuesday February 20 – the first District Work Period of the new Congress. 

<p>You may want to invite community leaders who have helped organize the event to speak briefly, explaining why the members of your community are saying NO to president Bush and the war in Iraq.

<p><b>2)   Read the names of servicemen and women from your area who have been killed in Iraq </b>– we're providing a list for your state on the website – as a reminder of why we're doing all this. You may also choose to stand in silence for a few moments.

<p><b>3)  Take a photo of your event to upload to the website’s “national family photo” gallery and to send to your local press:</b>
<p>This is easy, but also important – we'll be compiling the photos on the website from all across America, and you’ll be presenting them to the press in your news release to show that Americans do NOT agree with the President's plan to escalate our troop numbers. Use the downloadable NO! signs to show your opposition but you can also create your own NO!  

<p>Use your video camera or a videophone to record a 15-second personal message to your Member of Congress on why it’s vitally important that we stop the President from adding more troops in Iraq.  Instructions will be provided on the website for you to upload the video to the gallery and to YouTube. 

<p><b>4)   Finally, thank everyone for coming and encourage them to participate in the upcoming events </b>including the next local action that will also be occurring in communities throughout the country -  “Meet-Up with your Member” week. You can get more information on this on the website.  As people depart, offer them the take-home petition, which also includes reminders about other upcoming opportunities to work for an end to the Iraq War
