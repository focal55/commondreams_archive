<p>"Has anyone told you that you look like Gandhi?" my companion asked 
Professor Sami al-Arian.  Al-Arian was sitting behind a plastic wall 
wearing striped prison clothes and speaking into two telephones.

<p>	It was easy not only to see the resemblance, but also to feel it.  Dr. 
Al-Arian has a strikingly similar smile, Gandhi-like eyes, the same lean 
frame as he finished the first week of his hunger strike.  More 
remarkable, after being both prosecuted and persecuted, he maintains his 
confidence in the rule of law, the American system of justice, and the 
basic goodness of his persecutors.  And he has come through it all with 
his good nature and sense of humor, despite his weakening condition.	

<p>Dr. Sami Al-Arian has now spent four years in jail, three of those in 
solitary confinement while awaiting trial.  In December 2005, despite 
years to prepare the case against him, and an estimated $80 million 
dollars of American tax money to pursue it, Dr. Al-Arian was acquitted 
of eight of the seventeen charges against him, including conspiracy to 
commit racketeering, conspiracy to murder and maim people abroad, 
conspiracy to support a foreign terrorist organization (two counts), 
mail fraud (two counts), and obstruction of justice (two counts).  More 
than a year after his acquittal, we visited him at Northern Neck 
Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia, where he is being held for contempt 
of court for refusing to testify in an unrelated matter.

<p>The United States government was deeply embarrassed after this 
acquittal in a high-profile trial that was to have been a showcase for 
the USA PATRIOT Act.  After being imprisoned under conditions condemned 
by Amnesty International, in lock-down 23 hours a day for 37 months 
before his trial, regularly shackled and strip-searched, denied 
religious services, refused adequate access to the documents necessary 
to prepare his defense (tens of thousands of pages of transcripts from 
years of electronic surveillance), after being brought into the 
courtroom heavily shackled and treated as a terrorist, Al-Arian was 
gracious in victory.

<p>For Sami al-Arian, the jury's verdict reinforced the confidence he had 
always held in both the United States and her system of justice. 
Addressing the court, he thanked his attorneys and his adopted country.
<p>"This process, your Honor, affirmed my belief in the true meaning of a 
democratic society, in which the independence of the judiciary, the 
integrity of the jury system, and the system of checks and balances are 
upheld, despite intense political and public pressures....It's also my 
belief that an impartial and conscientious jury, as well as principled 
judicial rulings that uphold the values of the constitution, are the 
real vehicles that win the hearts and minds of people across the globe, 
especially in the Arab and Muslim world."

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union wrote to the government arguing that 
retrying Dr. Al-Arian "following the recent acquittal of all serious 
charges lodged against him would appear to be pointless and vindictive." 
<p> As the government refused to preclude a retrial, and with exhausted 
attorneys and inadequate funds to pursue a defense against the remaining 
counts (on which two jurors remained unconvinced), the defendant decided 
to conclude a plea deal.  Dr. Al-Arian pled guilty to one of the 
remaining charges against him solely in order to be finished with his 
ordeal.  He agreed to deportation in return for the termination of all 
legal proceedings against him, and what Al-Arian believed was a 
good-faith commitment relieving him of the obligation to testify against 
others.

<p>U.S. District Judge James Moody seemed unswayed even by the arguments 
of the prosecutors, and sentenced Dr. Al-Arian to another eleven months 
jail, to be completed in April 2007.  But it seems the government is 
unwilling to carry out this agreement.

<p>In October 2006 Virginia US Attorney in Gordon Kromberg asked a grand 
jury to subpoena Professor Al-Arian to testify in a case involving a 
Muslim think-tank.  Pointing out that testifying had been explicitly 
deleted from the plea bargain, with the specific consent of the 
prosecutors in Florida, he refused.  As he explained it to us last week, 
his refusal comes from two places.  First, he considers it inconsistent 
with his faith and his values to testify.  Second, he anticipates that 
any testimony would be used to create new "facts" to rearrest him.  His 
fear seems well-founded.  At a hearing in 2000, a government attorney 
asked whether Dr. Al-Arian believed that Islam could only be liberated 
through violence.  Professor Al-Arian's response, of course, was "No." 
One of the 17 counts against him in 2003 was perjury, the government 
contending he lied when responding that violence was not required to 
liberate Islam.

<p>Responding to being placed in civil contempt, Al-Arian pointed out that 
he had "no contempt whatsoever for this honorable court, but all the 
respect in the world for it."  It seems, instead, that it is the 
government that has contempt for the legal system Professor Al-Arian has 
relied upon and admired for decades.  Instead of respecting the plea 
agreement, Mr. Kromberg referred to it as a "bonanza."  Despite having 
been found guilty of nothing by a U.S. court, Judge Moody and Mr. 
Kromberg persist in their belief in Dr. Al-Arian's culpability.  It 
appears that Mr. Kromberg's attitude is based in part on Sami Al-Arian's 
religion.  Attorney Jack Fernandez requested that Kromberg delay 
Al-Arian's transfer to Virginia until the end of Ramadan.  Fernandez 
quoted Kromberg's response in an affidavit, "If they can kill each other 
during Ramadan, they can appear before the grand jury, all they can't do 
is eat before sunset. I believe Mr. Al-Arian's request is part of the 
attempted Islamization of the American Justice System. I am not going to 
put off Dr. Al-Arian's grand jury appearance just to assist in what is 
becoming the Islamization of America."  Gordon Kromberg has denied a 
request to recuse himself in this case.

<p>It was both Sami Al-Arian's religious faith, and his faith in our 
system of government that got him arrested in 2003.  Al-Arian actually 
believes what we say about freedom of worship, and has spent years 
trying to inform Americans about Islam.  Stunned by the events of 
September 11, he agreed to talk with Bill O'Reilly about Muslim 
responses to the tragedy.  To his surprise, the FOX News host attacked 
him, relentlessly interrogating him about an investigation dating back 
to 1993,  in which Al-Arian had been found blameless years earlier. 
Within days, Professor Al-Arian had been fired from the university in 
which he had taught for 15 years, despite his tenure.  As opposition 
mounted, and the American Association of University Professors 
threatened sanctions against the University of South Florida, the 
university's president got the help she needed: the FBI resurrected the 
old allegations and Al-Arian was arrested.

<p>It appears now that, despite being exonerated by a jury of his peers, 
Sami Al-Arian has been found guilty, guilty of being a Muslim, and a 
Palestinian.  In the years since September 11, 2001, more and more 
Muslims and Arabs have been accused of terrorism, their lives put on 
hold, their families divided, their freedom denied.  In the face of new 
legislation suspending habeus corpus and stripping even US citizens of 
their rights to a swift and fair trial, Professor Al-Arian's experience 
is a frightening foreshadowing of the futures of those who would count 
on American freedoms of religion, speech, dissent.

<p>Dr. Al-Arian continues to have faith in our system and in our country. 
  "As I leave," he told the court at his sentencing, "I harbor no 
bitterness or resentment. Looking back at my three decades in America, 
I'm indeed grateful for the opportunities afforded to the son of 
stateless Palestinian refugees in a foreign country, while denied such 
opportunity in his country of origin and the countries where he was born 
or raised.  I'm grateful that my five wonderful children were born and 
raised in a society that provided them with freedom and equal 
opportunities in order to reach their potential."

<p>Sami Al-Arian's children, and my children, need the American system of 
justice to prevail.  Time is running out for Professor Al-Arian as he 
continues to refuse food to protest the injustice of his continuing 
imprisonment.  Time is running out for justice if Americans refuse to 
insist on the enforcement of our Constitution.
