Any New Yorker will tell you that the best views of Manhattan are to be
found not on the island, but from across the water. The most sublime
commentator on the workings of “democracy in America,” it is often
argued, was not from America, but Europe—Alexis de Tocqueville, in his
majestic work by that very title. The Hubble Space Telescope has
snapped many breathtaking photographs of wondrous spiral galaxies
millions of light years away, but no human has ever held such a
perspective on our own spiral galaxy, the Milky Way, because no human
(nor even any human artifact) has ever viewed it from the outside.

<p>The greatest insight into a difficult and complex matter often comes
from an outside observer. In late February the International Atomic
Energy Agency announced that Iran had accelerated rather than suspended
its uranium enrichment activities. Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking
from Australia, immediately warned Tehran, “All options are still on
the table.” Two days later Cheney suddenly showed up, publicly
unannounced, in Pakistan, setting off a flurry of talk radio and
Internet speculation that the true purpose of the visit was to
negotiate flyover rights for an impending air assault on Iran. In
response, an Iranian deputy foreign minister stated, “We’re prepared
for any situation—even for war.” </p>
<p>
To the dismay and astonishment of the peace and progressive Democratic
base that swept the party back into power last November, the three
early front-runners for the 2008 presidential nomination—Sens. Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards—have consistently
expressed a similar hawkishness on Iran. Clinton and Edwards have even
uttered the identical “all options on the table” phrase!
</p>
<p>Why is Iran so intent on pursuing its atomic ambitions, despite such
naked saber rattling from the planet’s overweening military leviathan?
The most candid, unvarnished answer to that question has recently come
not from any Iranian or American but from someone viewing the impasse
from across the water. From Europe. From the outside. 
Vladimir Putin. 
</p>
<p>
“We are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper-use of military force in
international relations,” the Russian president said in Munich last
month, referring unambiguously to the United States. “Nobody feels
secure anymore,” and America’s adversaries “feel cornered.” Of course,
said Putin, “such a policy stimulates an arms race. <i>The force’s dominance inevitably encourages a number of countries to acquire weapons of mass destruction</i>” (emphasis added). 
</p>
<p>
Putin said what no Iranian officials will say, because if they did they
would have to admit that they are seeking not just nuclear electricity
but nuclear weapons. Putin said what no Bush administration officials
will say, because if they did they would have to admit that all their
efforts to, as President Bush put it in 2002, “free the world from
weapons of mass destruction in the hands of those who hate freedom”
have had precisely the opposite effect.

</p>
<p>Make no mistake. The repugnant comments by Iran’s president, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, about the Jewish past and the Israeli future deserve to be
renounced by any right-thinking citizen of the world. But Ahmadinejad’s
true influence among the mullahs has always been limited, and is now,
by all accounts, in free fall. Regardless of who is really running the
show, might not Iran have some legitimate national security interests
in its own self-preservation? </p>
<p>
Consider the world as seen from Tehran in the past half-decade. George
W. Bush announced a new doctrine of “pre-emption,” wherein the U.S. may
see fit to launch regime-changing invasions of states that Washington,
in its own subjective judgment, concludes might pose a threat, someday,
to American national security. He declared that of all the odious
regimes on the planet, three alone constitute an “axis of evil.”
Breaking with the entire Cold War legacy of mutual nuclear deterrence,
he issued a new nuclear doctrine, one that contemplated nuclear attacks
on non-nuclear states (in explicit violation of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty). He actually named seven states (including
Iran) as possible targets of a pre-emptive American nuclear first
strike. Then he launched his first pre-emptive war against the country
next door to Iran, decapitating its regime and driving its leader first
into a spider hole in the ground and then to the gallows. </p>
<p>
And after all that, Tehran finds itself surrounded on four sides by
American military power—Iraq to the west, Afghanistan to the east, U.S.
bases in Turkey and Central Asia to the north, and the mighty U.S. Navy
in the Persian Gulf to the south (which just recently doubled its
presence there). </p>
<p>
Putin did not explain exactly how nuclear weapons could serve to defend
a country like Iran from an overwhelming American air assault. But the
old Cold Warrior surely understands the new model of nuclear deterrence
that is emerging in the post-Cold War world—one that could radically
transform the 21st century nuclear landscape.
</p>
<p>During the Cold War’s long atomic arms race, it became clear that
nuclear weapons had little actual military value. It was difficult to
conceive of any scenario where the benefits of launching a nuclear
weapon could exceed the almost infinite risks. But we needed thousands
of nuclear weapons, the argument ran, because the Soviets possessed
thousands of nuclear weapons. And they needed them because we had them.
Our atomic arsenal deterred them from using theirs, and their atomic
arsenal deterred us from using ours. This, of course, was the logic
behind “mutually assured destruction,” or MAD—surely the most
appropriate acronym in all of human history. </p>
<p>
But if a country like Iran manages to acquire a nuclear arsenal, its
function will be dramatically different. Iran, of course, cannot hope
to defeat the United States in any kind of direct military
confrontation. No one can. But Tehran could aspire not to defeat but to
deter what must seem to Iranian leaders to be a very real threat of an
American military first strike. And to exercise such deterrence, it
doesn’t need the capacity to bring about the “assured destruction” of
the entire American nation. All it needs is the capability to vaporize
an American military base or three in Qatar or Kuwait or Iraq, or an
entire aircraft carrier battle group in the Persian Gulf, or even an
American city on one coast or the other. It also needs to indicate that
it would respond to any attack by employing that capability
immediately, before it becomes too late, following the venerable maxim:
“Use them or lose them.” This, we learned in recent years from
now-elderly Soviet officers who were on the ground during the Cuban
missile crisis, is precisely what they were prepared to do at even a
hint of an American first strike.
</p>

<p>There is, of course, only one thing that can provide Iran with this
kind of deterrent capability. Hint: it’s not nuclear electricity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When Tehran looks west, it sees an Iraq that abandoned its nuclear
weapons program, opened itself to unprecedented intrusions on its
sovereignty, did not in fact possess any weapons of mass
destruction—and got itself invaded for its trouble. </p>
<p>
When Tehran looks east, it sees a North Korea that is one of the most
desperate countries in the world. Most of its citizens are either
languishing in gulags or chronically starving. It is impoverished,
puny, a pathetic excuse for a 21st century nation-state. And yet,
because it chose an alternate course—constructing a small nuclear
arsenal in secret, then whipping back the curtain to reveal that
arsenal to the world—it appears to be successfully deterring any kind
of military attack from the greatest military juggernaut in human
history. </p>
<p>
What would you do if you were Iran? 
</p>
<p>
It is true that neither the International Atomic Energy Agency nor
American intelligence officials have put forth a shred of evidence
indicating that Iran has diverted materials from its nuclear energy
activities to a nuclear weapons program. It is also quite possible that
Iran might be dissuaded from its nuclear ambitions, in return for an
end to U.S. support for internal Iranian groups seeking the violent
overthrow of the regime (imagine if Iran were doing that here!), a
formal mutual security pact with non-aggression pledges in both
directions, and some acknowledgement on our part that the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty doesn’t just impose nonproliferation
obligations on them but also disarmament obligations on us. </p>
<p>
Instead, astonishingly, with the ceaseless beating of the Iran war
drums in the background, the Energy Department on March 2 announced a
contract to build a brand-new, ultra-modernized U.S. nuclear
warhead—the first in two decades—to ensure the long-term “reliability”
of the American nuclear arsenal.

</p>
<p>Until more enlightened diplomacy starts emanating from Washington,
Tehran will continue its march toward the nuclear Rubicon. The logic of
the situation requires it. No rational Iranian defense planner could
responsibly recommend anything else. </p>
<p>
A Cold War concept that never captured the public imagination quite
like MAD was the simple idea of “unacceptable damage.” If a vulnerable
nation could obtain the capability to impose unacceptable damage on an
adversary, that would probably be enough to cause that adversary to
pause, indefinitely, before initiating any kind of war. And the
obliteration of an American military base or naval formation or city
would clearly seem to qualify as “unacceptable damage” for us. Although
“UD” hardly contains the rich acronymphomaniacal irony delivered by
MAD, Iran and North Korea may be the first states to base their
national security strategies solidly upon it. </p>
<p>
There is very little reason to suppose that they will be the last.
