Last week, members of the Smedley Butler Brigade of Veterans for Peace
organized an office occupation of Representative Ed Markey's office in
Massachusetts.  Their demand was simple: refuse to continue funding
the Iraq war and vote against the $93 billion supplemental spending
request submitted to Congress by President Bush on February 5.  Their
action was one of a growing number of office occupations taking place
during the Occupation Project campaign of civil disobedience to end
Iraq war funding.

<p>Markey adroitly launched into song and dance, agreeing to meet and
promising, in writing, to vote against President Bush's request.  The
next day, he pivoted and swirled, doing the finest two step you'll
ever see.  He pronounced that he will most definitely vote against
President Bush's request.  He also pronounced that he will wait to
decide whether to vote for or against the final supplemental spending
bill being crafted by Representatives John Murtha and David Obey in
the House Appropriations Committee.  Talk about having your cake and
eating it too.

<p>Let there be no mistake.  The Democrats are buying the Iraq war lock,
stock and barrel.  Indeed, fewer votes may be cast against continuing
Iraq war funding this year than last year (or the year before) if
so-called, erstwhile antiwar Democrats follow the logic of Markey.

<p>The Democrats, led by Murtha and Obey, must be told in no uncertain
terms that they cannot simultaneously be against the Iraq war and
continue to fund the war.  Murtha's proscription is aptly dubbed a
"slow bleed" strategy, as reprehensible as the "slow bleed" strategy
of the Bush administration.  The Bush administration made a clear and
coldly calculated decision that, so long as deaths of U.S. soldiers
were kept to a "minimum" and spread out amongst communities across the
U.S., his administration could continue to wage this war without
arousing active opposition to this war from middle America.
Similarly, Murtha seems to be calculating that he and the Democrats
will survive a "slow bleed" of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi citizens while
he nibbles at the edges of ending the war in and occupation of Iraq.

<p>Murtha's proposals to end stop loss and stop move orders should be
supported.  A grave injustice is done to members of the U.S. military
when they are forced to serve beyond the end of their enlistment
contract or forced to extend their tour of duty in Iraq.  His proposal
to require that U.S. service members should also be at home for a
minimum of one year before being deployed back to Iraq is also worthy
of support.  Indeed, I and three others were arrested at the U.S.
Military Entrance Processing Command here in Illinois last July
pressing those demands.

<p>Murtha fiddles on the edges of using the power of the purse to end the
Iraq war while Rome-Baghdad-is burning to the ground.

<p>The situation is not all that much brighter on the Senate side of the
Congress.  Senators are posturing to be the most antiwar Senator,
especially those who are running for President.  None is yet showing
the political courage of their predecessors in the Senate-to actually
vote against any additional funding for the Iraq war.  The end of the
U.S. war in Vietnam began in 1965 when three Senators voted against
funding the war.

<p>Senator Feingold introduced S. 448, "The Iraq Redeployment Act of
2007", which calls for the cessation of most funding for U.S. military
operations in Iraq 180 days following passage of the act.  Senator
Obama introduced S. 433, "The Iraq De-Escalation Act of 2007", which,
in excessively convoluted language, moves towards calling for the
withdrawal of U.S. combat brigades from Iraq by March 31, 2008.
However, if you read S. 433, enough loopholes exist to drive a Mack
truck through, which ensure continuation of the Iraq war, most notably
the provision that the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Iraq
can be suspended with the simple certification by Bush to Congress
that Iraq is achieving the benchmarks spelled out in the legislation.
Neither S. 448 nor S. 433 contain any kind of enforcement language if
the President decides to ignore the resolutions.

<p>Senator Feingold and Senator Obama, will you dare take the requisite
steps to end the war by cutting war funding?  Senator Bernie Sanders,
I'm calling you out on this one too.  And you too, Senator Sherrod
Brown.  Each of you voted against funding the Iraq war while in the
House.  But you both conveniently lost your principles and your
conscience when you voted for Iraq war funding last year when you were
running for the Senate.

<p>If you can't bring yourself to vote against this supplemental spending
bill on its face, will you at least commit to the intermediate step?
Will you commit to introducing an amendment to the supplemental
spending bill, as well as to the regular Department of Defense
Appropriations bill (which contains another $142 billion for the war
next year), which will specify that any and all funding for the war
will be ended by a specific date and that all U.S. service members
will be withdrawn from Iraq by that date?  Will you further commit to
voting against any supplemental spending bill and / or regular
appropriations bill which does not contain such a provision?

<p>If not, Senators Feingold, Obama, Sanders and Brown and
Representatives Obey and Murtha-and all other erstwhile antiwar
Senators and Representatives-allow me to introduce you to
Representative Markey.  I'm sure we can arrange ball room dance
lessons so you can refine the Markey Two Step as you sway to the
Chattanooga Choo Choo train of war funding.
