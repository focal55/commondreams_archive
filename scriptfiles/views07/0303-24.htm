<p>Just as the Democrats could never seem to get a handle on Ronald Reagan 
in his sixteen years as Governor of California and President, the 
Republicans cannot get a handle on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.

<p>No matter what they tried-and they were admittedly timid-the Democrats 
could neither upset, mire, or throw Ronald Reagan on the defensive. He 
smiled, shrugged his shoulders and tefloned his way to victory after 
victory.

<p>The Republicans are flummoxed when it comes to Senator Clinton. They 
could not even mount a hardy campaign against her in 2006, leaving a 
nominal Yonkers mayor the hapless task to take up the space on the 
ballot opposite her. She walked to victory, spending over $35 million in 
the process.

<p>The reasons why Republicans cannot score points against Clinton is that 
she is so much like them on the key corporate power issues. Although she 
is on the Armed Services Committee, she took President Eisenhower's 
description of the "military-industrial complex" and repeatedly rubber 
stamped the massive, bloated, wasteful and corrupt expenditures.

<p>It was not for her to question any redundant weapons systems, no longer 
strategically needed in the post-Soviet Union era. It was not for her to 
act on the scores of investigative findings by the Government 
Accountability Office of the Congress documenting corporate waste, fraud 
and abuse and do something about them. Let a thousand weapon systems 
bloom was and is her mantra.

<p>The corporate crime wave of the past seven years, draining and looting 
trillions of dollars from workers, investors and pension-holders did not 
catch her industrious attention either. Notwithstanding the publicized 
enforcement efforts of her state's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, 
whose popularity took him to a landslide win for the Governorship, she 
refused to extend his efforts in the U.S. Senate by pushing the 
regulatory agencies for a necessary crackdown on corporate crime. He 
gave her the ultimate political cover, by showing the great public 
support for his "law and order" drives, but she lacked the political 
fortitude and opted instead for the political cash for her campaigns.

<p>Further contributing to the gigantic government deficit in Washington 
are the dozens of programs providing subsidies, handouts and bailouts to 
large corporations known as "corporate welfare." One would think that 
all that experience in her husband's White House, which she touts 
routinely, would have predisposed her to championing cutting corporate 
welfare that now amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars a year in an 
upward distribution of wealth from the have-littles to the have-lots. No 
way. Hillary lets the tax revenues and the tax loopholes grow and the 
windfalls swell the coffers of big business.

<p>By this time the Republicans cannot describe her in the least as 
"anti-business." Why the junior Senator from New York has done virtually 
nothing about the business crimes against the poor in her state, 
especially in the inner city where outrageous interest charges on 
pay-day loans, predatory lending, redlining, landlord abuses and code 
violations, lead and asbestos abound. Many of these financial scams 
benefit Wall Street financiers.

<p>What's left for the Republicans to work on? The Iraq war? Senator 
Clinton voted for the war resolution and refuses to admit her mistake in 
so doing. She remains generally a Democratic Hawk on foreign policy.

<p>What about global corporate trade? She is a fervent backer of the World 
Trade Organization and NAFTA, though she now wants to tweak them with 
some unenforceable labor and environmental qualifications. The evidence 
behind the treaties' supplanting our nation's legitimate sovereignty and 
procedural safeguards through these transnational forms of autocratic, 
secretive governance, is overwhelming. The evidence that these trade 
treaties have cost good industrial jobs, driven down efforts to keep 
living wages, and contributed to the country's huge trade deficits is 
also decisive.

<p>Yet Senator Clinton follows the Republicans and neuters what could be 
the latter's criticism of any potential demand for renegotiating these 
vise-like trade shackles that have led to shipping whole industries to 
the communist dictatorship in China.

<p>Moreover, she has co-sponsored bills with Republicans and received their 
public praise, including that of former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich.

<p>he new publication, Politico, headlined recently an article by Jim 
Vandehei and Carrie Sheffield with the words-"Clinton Presidency May be 
Inevitable, Republicans say." Former House Majority leader, Tom DeLay, 
is quoted as saying: "If the conservative movement and Republicans don't 
understand how massive the Clinton coalition is, she will be the next 
president." He should know about massive coalitions.

<p>The article also quotes other Republican Party bigwigs in the same vein. 
None of them offered any strategy. Instead they speak generalities that 
simply prove the point that Senator Clinton has them neutralized and 
nullified by the very brazen scope of her political expediency and 
opportunism.

<p>About all these Republican operatives could offer is that a Hillary 
presidency would prod and shock conservative foot soldiers into action. 
Such an attitude means capitulation for 2008.
