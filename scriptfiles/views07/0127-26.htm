<p>Among the tens of thousands of Americans protesting in the nation's 
capital against George W. Bush's war-quagmire in Iraq this weekend, more 
than a few will probably wonder why there are not more folks with them 
or, at least, more marching in other villages, towns and city squares 
around the country. After all, nearly 70% of the American people believe 
the war was a bad mistake and want out.

<p>Amidst all the proper discussion of restrictions and underminings of 
democracy in our society, one subject stands out almost as an 
unmentionable - namely, unused democratic capacity.

<p>Needless to say, my prior columns have pointed out the curtailments, 
suppressions and weakenings of democratic institutions and initiatives 
by government, corporations, elected officials and other institutions 
and forces behaving autocratically. Today, let's take note of some 
places and opportunities where we have plenty of elbow room, and space, 
to use our existing democratic capacity.

  <p> 1. Half of democracy is showing up. There are lots of empty seats at
      city council and boards of education meetings. Rallies rarely fill
      the streets to the extent allowed by demonstration permits.

 <p>  2. In New England, many municipalities have abolished the town
      meeting form of government because too few of the burghers bother
      to show up. Imagine - direct democracy. The people were the
      legislature in these smaller towns. You can't get anything better
      than that.

  <p> 3. There are legitimate complaints about the mass commercial media
      not telling us enough about many subjects early enough - such as
      years ago tobacco health risks, auto defects and the like. Too
      many advertising dollars were and are at stake. But they're giving
      us far more information than we use - to wit, corporate crime,
      fraud and abuse and ripping off the taxpayers. Recall: "It's Your
      Money," on ABC and the exposes on /Sixty Minutes/.

 <p>  4. Between ten and fifty percent of eligible voters actually vote,
      depending on the election, from a primary to a presidential. That
      leaves a lot of unused voter capacity. Another kind of capacity is
      doing one's homework, as a voter, so as to not go to the polls
      again and again to vote for incumbents who again and again vote
      against one's legitimate interests, however charming and
      distracting their empty slogans may be.

  <p> 5. Citizen groups who get justice done at the local, state and
      national levels offer more unused capacity. They would like very
      much for people, who share their grievances and applaud their
      remedies for change, to join them either as dues paying supporters
      and/or active collaborators. There are no filled quotas or
      standing room only signs for active supporters.

 <p>  6. How about all the times when agitated people say: "This isn't
      right, I'm going to call City Hall, contact my member of Congress,
      or collect signatures on a neighborhood petition?" But these civic
      energies are soon shelved. Self-declared but unused capacity.

<p>Of course, it is always easy to rationalize inactivity by saying: "Oh, 
it wouldn't have made any difference. They're going to do what they want 
anyhow." Sorry. That one wore out before 1776. Fortunately, enough of 
our forebears rejected that surrender mode and left us with much of what 
we like about our society.

<p>There is an additional long tail to the unused capacity by citizens to 
make a difference that does not go unnoticed by the politicos and the 
corporatists. Even when aroused citizens change the powerbrokers' 
directions, the powerbrokers resume course because they have learned 
that aroused citizens return to their unaroused state and cease their 
vigilance.

<p>The residents of Washington, D.C. are experiencing this with the new 
Mayor, 36 year old Adrian Fenty. As a distinct underdog, Mr. Fenty 
knocked on literally half the households of Washington, D.C. He took 
very little corporate money in a populist campaign opposed by local 
corporate interests and big developers who supported the early favorite, 
Linda Cropp. Mr. Fenty won overwhelmingly and owed nothing to these 
commercial interests.

<p>No sooner was he elected than he began to reverse himself. He went along 
with a $600 million taxpayer funded baseball stadium that he vigorously 
opposed as a city council member. He is thick with corporate consultants 
eyeing a city takeover of the dismal local school system.

<p>Sam Smith, the legendary local commentator and publisher of the 
Progressive Review, describes Fenty as actually believing in the Federal 
City Council - the core powers of the corporate world that have helped 
maintain Washington, D.C. as a model "tale of two cities" - one 
community rich, the larger other, poor and abandoned.

<p>Mr. Smith described a fellow activist as "lamenting how Adrain Fenty has 
gone corporate after campaigning as a populist." And he's only been 
mayor-elect and mayor for a few weeks.

<p>But Mr. Fenty knew that those doors of those homes and apartments he 
knocked on were opened by people he knew would no knock on his door at 
City Hall. The corporate lobbyists will be the ones knocking.
