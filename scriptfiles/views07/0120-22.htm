<a href="http://wpherald.com/articles/3022/1/Bush-claims-full-authority-to-implement-Iraq-plan/Iraq-troop-surge-going-forward.html" target="_blank"> invoking his "commander in chief" authority</a>
to escalate the war in Iraq, and he will
likely also invoke it to launch an aerial attack against Iran.
Congress 
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/warpow.html" target="_blank">
has long ago abdicated and delegated to the President</a>

its 
<a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/columns/fl.dean.warpowers/" target="_blank">
constitutional responsibility</a>
to initiate  wars. Yet  Congress
 still has one surefire way  to influence events:
it 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Use-Nuclear-Weapons-Contributions/dp/0313255202" target="_blank"> has the constitutional authority
to  make the "nuclear option" against Iran illegal</a>.
In so doing, it would stop the relentless drive to 
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060417fa_fact" target="_blank">
war against Iran</a>
dead in its tracks.
<p>
Notwithstanding 
<a href="http://www.upi.com/SecurityTerrorism/view.php?StoryID=20070111-013921-1755r" target="_blank">
Joe Biden's threat</a>

of a "constitutional confrontation" if Bush attacks Iran without
Congressional authorization, the fact is that such an attack would be
perfectly legal: the 
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/warpow.html" target="_blank">
War Powers Act</a>
gives the 
US President 
<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods54.html" target="_blank">
legal authority to wage war against any country
for 60 days</a>. It would 
<a href="http://www.antiwar.com/orig/hirsch.php?articleid=8007" target="_blank">
also be legal for Bush to order nuclear strikes</a>
against Iran: 
<a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nuclearchronology1.html" target="_blank">
under NSC-30 of 1948</a>, "the decision as to the employment
of atomic weapons in the event of war is to be made by
the Chief Executive". 
Neither 
<a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-18/116900034882160.xml&amp;storylist=orlocal" target="_blank">
Congressional "resolutions"</a>

nor 
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/04/murtha-troop-escalation/" target="_blank">
votes to withold funding</a>
will have 
<a href="http://www.infowars.com/articles/ww3/iran_cheney_dems_wont_stop_iran_attack.htm" target="_blank">
any effect on preventing such events</a>.
</p><p>
However, Congress could pass a law 
<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion?pid=79776" target="_blank">
making a nuclear attack on a non-nuclear nation</a>
in the absence of Congressional authorization illegal.
In so doing, Congress would effectively be preventing Bush from launching
<i>any</i> attack against Iran without its authorization, 
thus reclaiming its broader

<a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/warpowers/index.cfm?categoryId=1" target="_blank">
constitutionally assigned duties</a>. <i>Because Bush will not dare putting
150,000 American lives in Iraq at risk of Iranian retaliation without having
the 
<a href="http://www.peacecoalition.org/action/urgent/060420_rake_nuclear_option_off_table.html" target="_blank">
nuclear option on the table</a>.</i> 
By removing the 
<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=%20PE20060410&amp;articleId=2247" target="_blank">
nuclear option</a>
 from the Bush toolkit,
Congress would be forcefully imposing its will and that of the
American people on an administration gone mad.
</p><p>
If Congress chooses <i>not</i> to face the fact that US 
military action against Iran 

<a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/%7Ejorge/publicservice.html" target="_blank">
is likely to lead to the first US use of
nuclear weapons</a>
since Nagasaki, 
<a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/congress.html" target="_blank">
each one of its members will share responsibility</a>
for the nefarious chain of events that is likely to follow,

<b><font size="3">How Congress can act</font> </b>

</p>
<p>
Congress 
can  pass a law that will have a real, immediate and
historic effect: <i>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jorgehirsch/nuclear/nuclearbill.html" target="_blank">
outlaw the US use of nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states</a>
</i>. 
<a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/art1.htm" target="_blank">
Article I, Sect. 8, Clause 14</a>
 of the 
US constitution empowers Congress to 
<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/armed-force" target="_blank">
regulate the Armed Forces</a>.
Congress cannot micromanage the conduct of war, that is up to the
President, the Commander in Chief. But Congress can outlaw broad war
practices, 
<a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/080105I.shtml" target="_blank">

such</a>
as 
<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1216/p03s01-uspo.html" target="_blank">
torture</a>, or 
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/view/00029300/di981834/98p0872y/0" target="_blank">
the use of nuclear weapons</a> in any or all circumstances,
by regulating what US Armed Forces can and cannot do.
An example of such a bill, vetted by prominent constitutional law experts, 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jorgehirsch/nuclear/nuclearbill.html" target="_blank">
is given here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Critics will
say that nuclear weapons may be necessary against countries on the
verge of acquiring them. The law can allow for it: it should specify that Congress 
has  the authority to designate any country it chooses as a "nuclear weapon state",
not subject to this restriction.
</p><p>
Congress could even outlaw the US "first use of nuclear weapons" against anybody without
"the prior, explicit authorization of Congress". Such legislation 

<a href="http://www.jstor.org/view/00029300/di981834/98p0872y/0" target="_blank">
was considered and voted down by the US Senate in 1972</a>,
and it was considered again in hearings in the House of Representatives in 1976:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22first+use+of+nuclear+weapons%3A+preserving+responsible+control&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">
"First use of nuclear weapons: preserving responsible control"</a>.
We are suggesting here a much milder restriction on presidential authority.
</p><p>
Would the passage of such a law implicitly condone a conventional attack on Iran?
In no way. On the contrary,  
 it would instantly bring the drive to attack Iran to
a screeching halt, because Bush will not dare attacking Iran without having
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jorgehirsch/nuclear/nuclearoption.html" target="_blank">
his "nuclear option"</a>
on the table. 
Such a law will absolutely constrain the choices the President has. 
No matter how much 
"Commander in Chief" power 
<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/" target="_blank">
President Bush thinks he has</a>, he would <i>not</i> be able to ignore such a law without 
committing an impeachable offense. 
If Congress decides that attacking Iran is a good idea, Congress can vote to declare
that Iran is a nuclear-weapon state, subject to US nuclear attack, putting
the nuclear option back on the table (and by showing its determination, making
the "nuclear option"  a more credible 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory" target="_blank">
"deterrent"</a>).
 The President,  however, would be <i>forced</i> to  bring his case to Congress. 
</p><p>
Would  the passing of such a law "embolden" Iran? Not likely. Iran has not been deterred
from continuing enrichment by US threats, UN sanctions, nor 
statements that the 
<a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:ACqiRguf0mUJ:www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/04/20060418-1.html+%22Does+that+include+the+possibility+of+a+nuclear+strike%3F+Is+that+something+that+your+administration+will+plan+for%3F,&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" target="_blank">
"nuclear option" is on the table</a>. A forceful statement by the US that it will
use overwhelming conventional force against Iran if necessary, and reserving the
right to declare Iran a nuclear country subject to US nuclear attack at any time,
should be more than enough to keep Iran in check.
</p><p>
Such a bill would put the momentous decision to use  nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear states in the hands of Congress,  closer to the American
people, where it belongs, rather than at the sole discretion of an Executive
gone mad.  
<a href="http://kucinich.us/node/124" target="_blank">
More sweeping measures</a>
such as 

<a href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/issues/nuclear-weapons/start/10-reasons-abolish-nw.htm" target="_blank">
"abolishing nuclear weapons"</a>
are unrealistic and
have no chance of succeeding, hence they are  counterproductive.
</p><p>
Majority vote of both chambers, then overturning
the presidential veto: a mere 2/3 of Congress willing to 
avert a course of action that 
<a href="http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/home/Frontpage/2007/01/15/01309.html" target="_blank">
would bring humanity to the brink</a>, is
all that's needed.

get the ball rolling? Dennis

<b><font size="3">Crimes against humanity</font> </b>
</p>
<p>
Using nuclear weapons against Iran,
even just destroying one  Iranian underground facility with
nuclear bunker busters, with minimal "collateral damage", is
a crime against humanity because:

</p>
<ul>
<li> It will break the 60-year old taboo against the use of nuclear weapons.
Once a nuclear weapon is used again, it will invite use by others.
There is no sharp line dividing small from large nuclear weapons,  nor between
nuclear weapons targeting facilities and those targeting humans, 
civilians or military.
</li><li> Iran is years away from the capability of acquiring nuclear weapons by any
estimate, hence it is a "non-nuclear-weapon state" (NNWS).

The

American Physical Society</a>, representing the community of scientists that 
<a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/March99/APS/Bethe.Manhattan.html" target="_blank">
brought nuclear weapons into existence</a>, has recently for the first time in its 
history
<a href="http://www.aps.org/policy/statements/06_1.cfm" target="_blank">
issued a statement of deep concern</a>
 about "the possible use of nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states" and its consequences for the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
and some of America's most eminent scientists  recently 

<a href="http://www.physorg.com/news64505715.html" target="_blank">
wrote to President Bush</a> 
that such
action 
<a href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/archives/002256.php" target="_blank">
would be "gravely irresponsible" and lead to "disastrous consequences"</a>.

<p>
Iran is pursuing a civilian nuclear program, allowed
under the NPT. There is <i>
<a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:UC1Ij9GwQSwJ:www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Transcripts/2006/transcr06032006.html+%22We+have+not+seen+indication+of+diversion+of+material+to+nuclear+weapons+or+other+explosive+devices&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" target="_blank">

no evidence whatsoever</a>
</i> that Iran is pursuing 
nuclear weapons, only  
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22western+++governments+suspect&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" target="_blank">
"suspicions"</a>. It is always possible to interpret any
action by Iran in a negative way. If Iran slows down its
enrichment activity, 
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6262945.stm" target="_blank">
the press reports that</a>
"diplomats in Vienna began to worry that there was so little activity at Iran's 
main nuclear site that perhaps work had started on a secret site elsewhere in the 
country". 
(Of course no mention on who those "diplomats in Vienna" are). 
If Iran  accelerates its enrichment activity,
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-05-20-iran-un_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA" target="_blank">
"Iran heightened international concerns</a>
by announcing April 11 that it had enriched uranium with 164 centrifuges".
Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Saddam Hussein 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Should+Saddam+Hussein+choose+confrontation%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" target="_blank">
"chose war" </a>

by not being
able to allay "concerns" that he didn't have the 
weapons he didn't have.

<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243632,00.html" target="_blank">
Vice-President Cheney 
stated</a>
last Sunday on national TV
"There's no reason in the world why Iran needs to continue to pursue nuclear weapons".
This is the same Vice-President that 
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/08/20020826.html" target="_blank">
stated in 2002</a>
"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass 
destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use 
against our friends, against our allies, and against us."
His statements then were as categorical and as unsubstantiated as his statements today,
and 
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3718150.stm" target="_blank">
the 2002 statements were proven categorically false</a>. 
 Why doesn't Congress demand that Cheney
substantiate his statements today or else shut up or else  step down?
Isn't lying on matters of national security an impeachable offense?
</p><p> 
Iran bears no responsibility for the rising tensions. 
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243632,00.html" target="_blank">

When Cheney states</a>
<i>"Iran's a problem in a much larger sense. At the same time, of course, they're 
pursuing the acquisition of nuclear weapons. They are in a position where they 
sit astride the Straits of Hormuz, where over 20 percent of the world's supply of 
oil transits every single day, over 18 million barrels a day.
So the threat that Iran represents is growing, it's multi- dimensional, and it 
is, in fact, of concern to everybody in the region"</i>
he is candidly stating the Bush administration agenda, 
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/08/20020826.html" target="_blank">
just as he did in 2002</a>.
And Fox news' Chris Wallace  is happy to spell  it out: 
"In fact, it was the basis of the Bush doctrine: You will not allow the world's most 
dangerous powers to get access to the world's most dangerous weapons.
Can you pledge that, before you and the president leave office, you will take 
care of the threat of Iran?" Cheney's ominous answer:
<i>"I think we're working right now, today, as we speak, on key elements of that problem"</i>,
as America is 
<a href="http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,122251,00.html" target="_blank">
massing up its military power in the Persian Gulf</a>, just like
it did 
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0106-04.htm" target="_blank">
at this same time of the year in 2003</a>. 
</p><p>

On March 6, 2003, when asked whether or not the US would attack Iraq, President Bush
answered 
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030306-8.html" target="_blank">
"we're days away from resolving this issue at the Security Council"</a>,
and "we're working with Security Council members to resolve this issue at the
Security Council". 14 days later the US attacked Iraq, without Security Council's
approval. Watch for a similar script in the weeks ahead. 
</p><p>
<b><font size="3">Congress' guilt</font> </b>
</p>
<p>
Each member of Congress knows that the US President
has full legal authority today to launch a nuclear attack against any country in the
world. Each member of Congress knows that the Constitution assigns Congress 
the responsibility to regulate the Armed Forces, and that Congress has the
authority to regulate the use of nuclear weapons.
Each member of Congress knows the 
<a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/%7Ejorge/publicservice.html" target="_blank">
sweeping changes</a>
 in US nuclear weapons policies
and planning undertaken during this administration.
</p>
<p>

<i>
Any private assurances that Bush may have given to members of Congress that he will not
order the use of nuclear weapons against Iran without congressional authorization are
worthless. He can legally do it, and he will. 
</i>
</p><p>
Any arguments the administration may put forth
that legislating over nuclear weapons use will
have a detrimental effect on the diplomatic effort vis-a-vis Iran will be as disingenuous  
as the arguments in September  2002 that Congress should authorize the use of
force against Iraq so that diplomacy could succeed:
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020919-1.html" target="_blank">
<i>"I've asked for Congress' support to enable the administration to keep the peace"</i></a>;
<i>"If you want to keep the peace, you've got to have the authorization to use 
force. But it's -- this will be -- this is a chance for Congress to 
indicate support. It's a chance for Congress to say, we support the 
administration's ability to keep the peace. That's what this is all about."</i>

Principle 
<a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/390?OpenDocument" target="_blank">
VII of the Nuremberg tribunal</a>
stated
"Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or
a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under
international law."
</p><p>
If Congress doesn't legislate on the US use of nuclear weapons, 
and  President Bush  orders the use of nuclear
weapons against Iran, <i>he will be doing it in the name of 
<a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/congress.html" target="_blank">
each and every member of the 110th Congress</a></i>. 
</p><p>
The United States will have instantly offered the world 535 new defendants
for future war crimes tribunals. Nuclear weapons are 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22weight+for+weight%2C+the+energy+produced+by+a+nuclear+explosion&amp;btnG=Google+Search" target="_blank">

million-times more powerful</a>
than conventional weapons.  If 535 million people die in ensuing nuclear
conflicts, <i>each member of the 110th Congress will have 1 million human lives
on his/her own personal account</i>.

Saddam Hussein and Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti went to the gallows for a mere 148.

He recently organized of a recent petition, circulated among leading physicists, opposing the new nuclear weapons policies adopted by the US in the past 5 years. He is a frequent commentator on Iran and nuclear weapons.
