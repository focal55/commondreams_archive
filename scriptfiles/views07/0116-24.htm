<p>ONE OF the more far-reaching aspects of President Bush's new strategy was his stunning rebuke of the Iraq Study Group recommendation that the United States should try to "engage" Iran and Syria "constructively." Instead, the president has made more threats and promises more confrontation. He promised to "seek out and destroy the networks providing advance weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq," opening up the possibility of cross border operations.</p>
<p>Congress was quick to react. Senator Joe Biden,  Democrat of Delaware,  made it clear that any move to expand the war into neighboring countries would need congressional approval, and Chuck Hagel,  a Nebraska Republican,  compared the prospect with  the invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>It is ironic that while  Bush ramps up confrontation, the Iraqi government -- presumably our ally -- is trying to make diplomatic efforts toward  both Iran and Syria to explore areas of mutual interest.</p>
<p>It can be no coincidence that an Iranian "office of relations" in Kurdish Erbil was attacked by Americans almost as the president was speaking last week. At the same time the president reminded Americans that he is sending more naval strength to the Persian Gulf  and anti missile systems to America's Sunni allies on the Gulf's western shore to confront Iran.</p>
<p>The confrontation escalation also shows that the hoped for revival of influence by the "realist" wing of the Republican Party is not coming any time soon  and that the influence of the party's high priest of confrontation, Vice President Dick Cheney, remains strong. But having unleashed Shi'ite  power by overthrowing Saddam Hussein, and thereby tremendously increasing the influence of Iran, the United States is going to have a difficult time putting that toothpaste back in the tube.</p>
<p>There remains, of course, the nuclear bomb issue, which the Iraq Study Group hoped to put on a different track than Iranian influence in Iraq. But are we now feeling a renewed undertow toward  military action against Iran?</p>
<p>The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh has been writing about the Pentagon's plans to strike Iran, which he says are far beyond anything that ordinary contingency planning could account for. Time Magazine ran a cover story a while back  titled  "What War With Iran Would Look Like."</p>
<p>The American Jewish Committee took out a full page ad in The New York Times showing Iran in the center of concentric circles, including all the Middle East and beyond, asking: "Can anyone within range of Iran's missiles feel safe?"</p>
<p>Professor Efraim Inbar of Israel's Bar Ilan University has written that military action against Iranian nuclear installations "has many risks and is complicated, but the difficulty is exaggerated, and inaction is bound to bring about far worse consequences."</p>
<p>And recently The Times of London carried an article -- quickly denied in Jerusalem -- that Israel has a secret plan to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities by using a low-yield nuclear weapons, about "one fifteenth of the Hiroshima bomb."</p>
<p>The Times quoted Israeli military sources as saying that, unlike Iraq's Osirak nuclear facility, which the Israelis destroyed by air in 1981, the Iranian sites were too well protected to destroy with conventional bombs. The Israeli Air Force has been making practice runs far out into the Mediterranean, according to The Times. It quoted an unnamed official as saying "as soon as the green light is given, it will be one mission, one strike and the Iranian nuclear project will be demolished."</p>
<p>The Israeli foreign office dismissed the report as "absurd," and said that Israel was 100 percent behind the diplomatic efforts to persuade Iran to give up nuclear ambitions. Are such reports sheer nonsense? Or just contingency plans? Or perhaps leaks designed to dismantle the plan? Or leaks designed to put more pressure on Iran -- or perhaps to put pressure on the United States to get serious? One doesn't know, but Cheney long ago said that perhaps the Israelis will one day act on their own, which sounded suspiciously like a green light.</p>
<p>Every Israeli prime minister has had to fear in one remote corner of the brain that the effect of Zionism might be to gather all the Jews in one place for destruction. This fear has been brought front and center by Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's criminally irresponsible call for the destruction of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Yet a widening of the Iraq war will be as destructive as was widening the Vietnam War in the last stages of that conflict. If ever there was a time for everyone to step back and take a deep breath, it is now.</p>
