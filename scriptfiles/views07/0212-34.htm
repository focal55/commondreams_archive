<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->With the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a colloquium of hundreds of top climate scientists from around the world, it is now beyond serious question that global warming is real, relentless and, to a 90 percent certainty, largely the consequence of human activity.<p/>Ninety percent is about as much agreement as you can get from science on any phenomenon, short maybe of gravity. This matter, after years of dithery back and forth, is flat nailed.<p/>So the game now is to spread uncertainty about how extensive, enduring and damaging the consequences could be. The objective: Create enough public confusion that it will be impossible to assemble a compelling constituency for the necessarily broad and, frankly, costly steps needed to fend off the worst effects.<p/>Outright naysayers are melting away as surely as an Arctic glacier, and are on their way to the same marginalization as the holdout Flat Earthers, useful, if at all, only for amusement.<p/>True, a noisy swatch of the social and political right, often in cahoots with energy, transport and other culpable industries, still and with increasing desperation denounces the very topic as just so much wool pulled over the world's eyes, a liberal conspiracy to destroy free-market economies, the hysteria of venting eco-freaks.<p/>And right-wing talk radio -- there is hardly any other kind -- and the militant rightist bloggers have been afroth since the report with indignation and outrage, as they always are about one thing or another.<p/>The smarter players are adopting the model Creationists have used against evolution: Portray the issue as one of honest disagreement between two camps, unsuitable turf for public policy to stake out a strong stand.<p/>Some quarters have even been driven to buying dissent. The Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, usually in the sane range of conservatism, is dangling $10,000 grants to academics who will inveigh against the report's science and conclusions. (The panel's members worked pro bono.)<p/>The Bush administration welcomed the report, lauded its contribution to research and then said it won't do anything to stall, much less to halt and reverse, the warming.<p/>And, peculiarly, a National Journal poll finds that only 13 percent of congressional Republicans accept that warming is man-made, down 10 points from last April, a period in which the evidence has been piling up rapidly.<p/>The Republican Party has backtracked so far from science that it might soon begin casting horoscopes, trying to turn lead into gold and setting up observatories to track the sun's orbit around Earth.<p/>This foolishness won't do. By midcentury, the momentum alone from the warming to date will carry the Earth into debilitating weather tumults. Unchecked, by century's end the warming will be causing species kills and shrinking the habitable space for our own kind.<p/>As the most disproportionate contributor to the problem, the United States should be leading the world toward a deep decline in fossil-fuel use, publicly supported transit, well-funded R &amp; D for alternative energy, a careful revival of nuclear power and much more.<p/>Instead, we are in the hands of contrary ideologues and politicians owned by the offenders. It should be obvious by now, even to them, that if we don't fix Earth, Earth will fix us.
