<p>Over the course of 21-year course history of Corporate Crime Reporter, we have interviewed scores of prosecutors and former prosecutors.

<p>And one standard question we ask is – have politics ever entered into your decision-making process of whether or not to prosecute a corporate crime case or a public corruption case?

<p>Percentage of prosecutors interviewed who have admitted to political interference?

<p>Zero percent.

<p>Percentage of prosecutors who say – never happened?

<p>One hundred percent.

<p>We never believed these answers.

<p>Life is too complicated for absolutes.

<p>And yesterday on Capitol Hill, we got a peek at a separate reality.

<p>Lo and behold, it turns out that politicians want to know.

<p>And they pick up the phone and call the U.S. Attorney and ask – what’s up with that public corruption prosecution?

<p>When’s it going to happen?

<p>And it turns out that prosecutors prosecute for political benefit.

<p>Got to get this prosecution done before the election.

<p>And their political superiors try to stop those prosecutions – also for political benefit.

<p>Carol Lam was the U.S. Attorney for San Diego.

<p>Unlike most of her 92 fellow U.S. Attorneys, Lam decided that she was going to spend her scarce resources on prosecuting white collar and corporate crime.

<p>She prosecuted public corruption in the city of San Diego.

<p>She prosecuted corporate fraud in the health care industry.

<p>And she sent to jail a powerful member of Congress – Randy Duke Cunningham (R-California) – for public corruption.

<p>Under her tenure, street crime in San Diego also plummeted.

<p>But according to her superiors, she ranked 91st our of 93 in gun violence prosecutions.

<p>And she ranked low for immigration smuggling prosecutions.

<p>She says she was bringing fewer cases – but cases with more bang for the buck.

<p>The Justice Department’s response to Lam – you’re fired.

<p>David Iglesias was the U.S. Attorney in New Mexico.

<p>Iglesias was eyeing a public corruption prosecution of local Democratic Party officials.

<p>One day, while at home, Iglesias gets a call from Senator Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico) – the man who gave Iglesias his job.

<p>“He wanted to ask me about the corruption matters or cases widely reported in the local media,” Iglesias said. “‘Are these going to be filed before November?’ – he asked. I said I didn’t think so. ‘I’m very sorry to hear that’ – he said. The line went dead. He didn’t say goodbye.”

<p>“I felt sick afterward,” Iglesias said. “I felt he was upset at hearing the answer he received. I felt leaned on, pressured to get these matters moving. It was unprecedented to get a call at home. It had never happened before.”

<p>Iglesias said that the 2006 political race in New Mexico was very close – and the prosecution of Democrats for public corruption would have made a difference in the election.

<p>Iglesias said that Congresswoman Heather Wilson (R-New Mexico) called him and said she had been hearing about “sealed indictments.”

<p>“When she asked – ‘What can you tell me about sealed indictments?’ – red flags went up in my head,” Iglesias said. “We cannot talk about a sealed indictment. It’s like talking about launch codes at Sandia National Lab.”

<p>“I said something about sealed indictments for national security cases,” Iglesias said. “She was not happy with that answer.”

<p>The Justice Department’s response to Iglesias – you’re fired.

<p>Thomas DiBiagio was the U.S. Attorney in Maryland.

<p>He told the New York Times that he was forced out in early 2005 because of political pressure stemming from public corruption investigations involving associates of the state’s governor, Robert Ehrlich – a Republican.

<p>“There was direct pressure not to pursue these investigations,” DiBiagio told the Times. “The practical impact was to intimidate my office and shut down the investigations.”

<p>But William Moschella – an assistant deputy attorney general – told a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee that after the Times ran the article, he spoke with the Justice Department’s ethics official, David Margolis.

<p>Moschella said that Margolis’ investigation of the situation found that “there were inappropriate e-mails and a staff meeting initiated by Mr. DiBiagio in which he specifically called for public corruption cases within a specific time frame indicating he wanted to bring some prior to the election.”

<p>“This was so egregious that the Deputy Attorney General at the time – Jim Comey – had to write him a letter saying – you will not bring any public corruption cases without running it by me first,” Moschella said.

<p>The Justice Department’s response to DiBiaggio – you’re fired.

<p>The President can fire a U.S. Attorney for any reason or for no reason.

<p>So, we’re not saying Lam, Iglesias, DiBiagio or any of the other U.S. Attorneys shouldn’t have been fired.

<p>But don’t feed us a line of bull that corporate and white collar crime prosecution are non-political in nature.

<p>It’s the political economy.

<p>Stupid.
