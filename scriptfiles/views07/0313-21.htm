<p>On March 1, the House of Representatives took a historic step by
passing the Employee Free Choice Act with a vote of 241 to 185.  This
was the result of a four-year labor movement mobilizing workers around
the restoration of the right of working people to bargain collectively
to improve their lives. In February of this year, more than 130 Members
of Congress listened at nearly 100 separate events as workers looked
them in the eye to tell them the grueling obstacles they faced when they
tried to form a union. Another 200,000 union members and allies sent
email, wrote letters, and made phone calls to their elected leaders.

<p>The bipartisan Employee Free Choice Act will do three things to help
strengthen and expand the middle class:  1) strengthen penalties for
employers that violate workers* freedom to make their own choice about
a union, 2) allow a neutral party to determine a first contract if the
company and employees cannot reach an agreement, and 3) enable people to
form unions when a majority of employees indicate in writing they want
one, which would return the choice on whether to form a union to the
employees.

<p>Corporations and the right wing noise machine are doing everything they
can to stop workers from having the right to bargain collectively with
their employers. They know that when workers are united and empowered
through unions, they will negotiate for health benefits, pensions, safer
working conditions, and higher wages. To fight this act, corporations
are running unprecedented print, radio, and TV ads across the country in
major media markets in a cynical attempt to confuse and dissuade elected
leaders.

<p>We know that working people and their stories are the most powerful way
to counteract these messages. For example, newly elected Representative
Jason Altmire, a co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, heard from
Bob Boyle from Butler, Pennsylvania, who told his story about being
fired for trying to form a union at Oesterling, Sandblasting, and
Painting with the United Steelworkers.

<p>Bob was sick of having to buy his own respirators necessary to do his
work safely and felt that he did have job security or respect on the
job. Along with his co-workers, he began to form a union. Oesterling did
what most corporations do today when its workers attempt to improve
their lives by forming unions; they began a ruthless intimidation
campaign. 

<p> began with Bob being forced to sit with his direct supervisor
one-on-one intimidation sessions discouraging him from forming a union.
It continued with threats that the company would sell the operation and
eliminate the workforce. Aided by these grueling tactics, the company
persuaded a majority of workers to vote against forming a union. What
happened to Bob, a worker who only missed four days of work in 17 years?
He was fired.

<p>"I wanted a safer workplace, and I wanted a union," Boyle told Rep.
Altmire. *There is no doubt in my mind that I was fired because of my
union activity. No doubt. Not one.*

<p>Unfortunately, Bob*s story is nothing new and affects thousands of
workers every year.
One out of five union activists are likely to be fired when they try to
form unions, according to a new study by the Center for Economic Policy
Research. 78% force supervisors to meet one-on-one with the people they
supervise and urge them to vote *no.*  In over half of worker
campaigns, employers threaten that the workplace will close if workers
form a union, yet with the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act in
the U.S. House, it seems that employees are turning a corner.
 
<p>In the coming months as we head towards a vote on the Employee Free
Choice Act in the U.S. Senate, hundreds of thousands more employees will
take action in support of the legislation through petition campaigns at
the worksite. This campaign will deploy a "Stewards Army" of thousands
of union members at worksites across America to convince U.S. Senators
of the legislations potential to expand and strengthen the middle
class.

<p>Additionally, across the country in States, cities, municipalities, and
townships, elected leaders will pass resolutions in support of the
Employee Free Choice Act. Finally, nearly all U.S. Senators will hear
directly from workers several times about the grueling obstacles workers
face when trying to form unions in roundtable meetings and mass actions.
These workers, along with allied leaders and the progressive community,
will confront every U.S Senator and ask them if they support an expanded
and strengthened middle class. If they do, the Employee Free Choice Act
is the way to achieve it.
