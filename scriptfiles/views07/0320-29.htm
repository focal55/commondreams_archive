<p>You’re familiar with the story about Sherlock Holmes and his camping trip with Watson, right?
<p>
They set up tent and go for a hike. Exhausted, they return to camp as
night falls. First Watson hops in his cot. Holmes gets under his covers
and stares up at the cloudless night sky.</p><p>
“My dear, Watson. Do you see what I see?”</p><p>
“Oh yes, the Milky Way is quite prominent tonight.”</p><p>
“No. Look closer.”</p><p>
“Now, I see it. The Big Dipper...”</p><p>
“No, no. It’s elementary, Watson. Someone stole our tent!”</p><p>

Since I first started writing about U.S. policy in Iraq 10 years ago, I
keep having the someone-stole-our-tent moment over and over again.</p><p>
Have you been reading these stories about how “the surge” seems to be
working. The violence in Baghdad seems to be subsiding. Even Sen. John
Sununu, R-N.H., who just led a delegation to Iraq, said the Bush push
to secure Baghdad “appears to be working,” according to the Associated
Press.</p><p>
I suppose his words are supposed to carry some weight because the good
senator is of Palestinian descent. He’s one of “them.” That kind of
stuff works on some folks – like trotting out Colin Powell and Condi
every now and then to explain why yet another nation full of backward
dark-skinned people need to be bombed – I mean, “liberated” – from
barbarism.</p><p>
Not knowing him personally, it’s hard to say why a smart guy like
Sununu would say something so foolish without adding a HUGE caveat.</p><p>
Of course, the violence is subsiding. This is a guerrilla war!</p><p>
Guerrilla War 101: “When guerrillas engage a stronger enemy, they
withdraw when he advances.” That’s right out of Mao Tse-tung’s classic
treatise “On Guerrilla Warfare.”</p><p>
“When the invader pierces deep into the heart of the weaker country and
occupies her territory in a cruel and oppressive manner, there is no
doubt that conditions of terrain, climate, and society in general offer
obstacles to his progress and may be used to advantage by those who
oppose him. In guerrilla warfare we turn these advantages to the
purpose of resisting and defeating the enemy.</p><p>
“Guerrilla warfare basically derives from the masses and is supported
by them; it can neither exist nor flourish if it separates itself from
their sympathies and co-operation. There are those who do not
comprehend guerrilla action,” Mao wrote way back in 1937.</p><p>
The good news is: Gen. David Petraeus is now in charge of our forces in
Iraq. A few weeks ago the general said something straight out of a Sean
Gonsalves column. “Any student of history recognizes that there is no
military solution to a problem like (guerrilla insurgencies) in Iraq.”
Then, this past Sunday, the AP reported on Petraeus’ new leadership,
illustrating what the fear-induced fools in right-wing radio land and
the soft-handed talking heads who play tough guys on TV “news” shows
can’t seem to get through their history-challenged heads.</p><p>

Petraeus “has revamped the counterinsurgency strategy, designed to win
back not only the turf but public support... . To set the tone,
Petraeus has made several high-profile forays into public markets in
Baghdad and elsewhere...smiling and greeting bystanders with simple
Arabic phrases” – the kind of Arabic phrases that, if someone were to
suggest they be taught in American schools, would trigger conservatives
to decry the evil influence of political correctness and
multiculturalism.</p><p>
This business of treating Iraqis like human beings instead of evil
incarnate as fantasized by jingoists here in the States “carries some
risk to U.S. troops...but the U.S. command seems prepared to take the
chance. The new motto: ‘The more you protect the force, the less secure
you really are’.” Gary Brecher, the “War Nerd,” has been trying to
teach us real good on this and it took me some time to notice that
someone stole our tent, too. It bears repeating. C’mon, say it with me:
short of genocide (dropping nukes and turning the Iraqi desert into a
sea of glass), there is NO military solution to guerrilla insurgencies.</p><p>
It’s elementary, really. Actually, it’s asymmetrical.</p>
