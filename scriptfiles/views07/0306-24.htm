Good news from Belgium. After forty-six nations--including Britain, Canada, and Germany--met in Oslo in February and <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=2899437">agreed to work towards a global ban on cluster bombs</a> over the next year, Belgium became the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSL02211558._CH_.2400">first nation</a> to make investing in companies that produce the weapons a crime.
</p>
<p>

Under the new Belgian law, the government would publish a list of
manufacturers and "prohibit banks from offering credit to cluster bomb
makers and from owning shares or bonds in these companies."
</p>
<p>Cluster bombs are spread over vast areas and many unexploded
"bomblets" lie dormant for years. (The UN estimates that as many as 40
percent of 4 million bomblets dropped by Israel in Lebanon failed to
explode on impact, and the weapons have recently been used in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Kosovo as well). Civilians--especially children who are
attracted to "their small size and bright colors"--are often the people
who detonate them. An estimated <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11125857/">60 percent of the victims</a>
in Southeast Asia are children. According to organizers, the Oslo
conference was spearheaded in order to "avoid a potential humanitarian
disaster posed by unexploded cluster munitions." The 46 participating
nations approved a declaration to "conclude by 2008 a legally binding
international instrument [to] prohibit the use, production, transfer
and stockpiling of those cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm
to civilians."
</p>
<p>The United States was noticeably absent from the Oslo conference (as
were China and Russia). This is not surprising, since the Bush
Administration continues to move towards a renewed arms race. At this
critical moment when we are pushing Iraq and North Korea to abandon any
ambitions to become a nuclear power, the Bush Administration is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201203.html">attempting</a>
to build "the first new nuclear warhead produced by the United States
in more than 20 years." (This after the Administration's effort to
build a nuclear "bunker buster" weapon was thwarted by the normally
"see no evil hear no evil" Republican Congress). </p><p>
Fortunately, there is opposition to the latest chapter in the Bush
Administration's "what else can we do to piss off the world?" approach
to...well, everything. Senator Dianne Feinstein <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201203_pf.html">told Walter Pincus</a> of the <i>Washington Post </i>

that she is "100 percent opposed" to the new weapon--the Reliable
Replacement Warhead (RRW). But the netroots' not-so-favorite Democrat,
Representative Ellen Tauscher, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/20/AR2007022001575.html">said</a>
that she is "encouraged" by the new nuclear plan--perhaps because
Livermore National Laboratory was selected to design the weapon and
it's located in her district.
</p>
<p>
This is a perfect moment for readers of this column to send a letter to Tauscher (2459 Rayburn HOB, Washington, DC 20515; or by <a href="http://www.house.gov/tauscher/IMA/get_address.htm">e-mail</a>
if a resident of her district), letting her know that the world doesn't
need another nuclear weapon. In fact, if she wants to do a great
service she might not only work against this new nuke but get the
United States on board with 46 other nations to ban the cluster bomb
too.</i></P>
