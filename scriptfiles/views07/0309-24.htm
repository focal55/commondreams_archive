<p>More than five years have passed since President Bush labeled Iraq, Iran and
North Korea the ''axis of evil.'' It is imperative that we try to piece
together what role U.S. intelligence played in supporting the ''axis''
idea and the misguided policies and actions that ensued.

<p>For the
''axis of evil'' sobriquet morphed into axes for grinding by
accomplices like then-CIA Director George Tenet, and the pandering was
consequential. Here is the ''axis'' part of Bush's State of the Union
address on Jan. 29, 2002:</p>

<blockquote><i> ``North Korea is a regime arming
with missiles and weapons of mass destruction. . . . Iran aggressively
pursues these weapons. . . . The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop
anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. . . .
States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of
evil . . . posing a grave and growing danger. . . . I will not wait on
events . . .''</i></blockquote>

<p>Nor, apparently, wait on good intelligence, either.</p>

<p>It
used to be that presidents made decisions based, at least in part, on
the judgments of the intelligence community. It was a shock to see that
process stood on its head, with the president asserting a ''grave and
growing danger'' and then telling functionaries like Tenet to conjure
up the ''intelligence'' to support his rhetorical flourishes. We are
talking about untruths with tragic consequences.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•&nbsp;</span><strong>Iraq:</strong>
Anyone who has been awake over the past five years is aware of how the
intelligence process was corrupted to justify attacking Iraq. No thanks
to the corporate media, but many have also learned of the ''Downing
Street Memorandum,'' which provides documentary evidence of lying. That
memo, acknowledged by the British to be authentic, contains the minutes
of a meeting on July 23, 2002, at which the chief of British
intelligence gave Prime Minister Tony Blair an update on Bush's plans
for war.</p>

<p>Based on conversations with Tenet at CIA headquarters
three days before, the UK intelligence chief told Blair and his
advisors about the evidence that Bush intended to use to ''justify''
his decision to make war on Iraq. When the British foreign minister
observed that the intelligence was ''thin,'' the intelligence chief
famously said, ``But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.''</p>

<p>It does not get much clearer than that.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea:</strong>

It turns out that Bush's repeated claims, beginning in the fall of
2002, that North Korea was secretly producing highly enriched uranium
in addition to its publicly known plutonium program were, well, wrong.
We should not be surprised, since that dubious intelligence analysis
was brought to us by the same folks who were stretching those Iraqi
''aluminum tubes'' well beyond their tolerance, and stretching our
credulity well beyond the breaking point.</p>

<p>Pyongyang had bought
some nuclear equipment from Pakistan and elsewhere but, according to
multiple sources of veteran reporter Jonathan Landay, there was never
any evidence that the North Koreans were able to assemble that
equipment into a functioning uranium enrichment program. This came up
at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Feb. 27, when a senior
intelligence officer announced that the earlier judgment (stated, mind
you, with ''high confidence'') that North Korea was building an
industrial-scale uranium enrichment program has now been downgraded to
a ''mid-level confidence'' judgment.</p>

<p>Was the earlier judgment
consequential? Judge for yourself: Bush used the alleged uranium effort
to renege in December 2002 on deliveries of heavy fuel oil promised in
return for North Korea freezing its plutonium production program under
the bilateral agreement of 1994. The following month, North Korea ended
its freeze and expelled U.N. inspectors. It has now harvested enough
plutonium for about a dozen nuclear weapons and conducted its first
test.</p>

<p><b>Iran:</b> Maybe, just maybe, this consistent record of hyping the nuclear threat
from the ''axis of evil'' will prompt sober minds to look under the
hood and kick the tires when it comes to Iran. On Iran the intelligence
community at least has been consistent, but in a manner far from
reassuring. In 1995 it started saying -- every year -- that  Iran was ``within five
years'' of reaching a nuclear weapons capability. When the last
National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) was published almost two years
ago, the forecast basically was moved out to 10 years. But in a fit of
nervous caution the estimators agreed on the expression
''early-to-mid-next decade.'' Testifying before the Senate on Feb. 27,
National Intelligence Director Michael McConnell was consistent; he
used that same formula.

<p>A
fresh NIE on Iran is said to be in final draft, and McConnell surely
had been briefed on how it addresses this question. OK, let's assume
the new consistent forecast is correct -- that Iran does intend to
produce nuclear weapons and could have that capability within that
time-frame.</p>

<p>Hello! That would mean there is still time for
unconditional U.S.-Iran bilateral talks to address Iran's intentions
even if -- especially if -- the Iranians are determined to create a
''grave and growing danger'' of the kind fraudulently posited for Iraq.
As Churchill put it, ``Better to Jaw-Jaw Than War-War.''</p>
