<b>A Few Words in Defense of Our Country</b>
<p>By Randy Newman</p>

<p>I’d like to say a few words<br>In defense of our country<br>Whose people aren’t bad nor are they mean<br>Now the leaders we have<br>While they’re the worst that we’ve had<br>Are hardly the worst this poor world has seen </p>
<p>Let’s turn history’s pages, shall we? </p>
<p>Take the Caesars for example<br>Why within the first few of them<br>They had split Gaul into three parts<br>Fed the Christians to the lions<br>And burned down the City<br>And one of ’em<br>Appointed his own horse Consul of the Empire<br>That’s like vice president or something<br>That’s not a very good example, is it?<br>But wait, here’s one, the Spanish Inquisition<br>They put people in a terrible position</p>

<p>I don’t even like to think about it<br>Well, sometimes I like to think about it </p>
<p>Just a few words in defense of our country<br>Whose time at the top<br>Could be coming to an end<br>Now we don’t want their love<br>And respect at this point is pretty much out of the question<br>But in times like these<br>We sure could use a friend </p>
<p>Hitler. Stalin.<br>Men who need no introduction<br>King Leopold of Belgium. That’s right.<br>Everyone thinks he’s so great<br>Well he owned The Congo <br>He tore it up too<br>He took the diamonds, he took the gold<br>He took the silver<br>Know what he left them with?<br>Malaria</p>

<p>A president once said,<br>“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself”<br>Now it seems like we’re supposed to be afraid<br>It’s patriotic in fact and color coded<br>And what are we supposed to be afraid of?<br>Why, of being afraid<br>That’s what terror means, doesn’t it?<br>That’s what it used to mean </p>
<p>The end of an empire is messy at best<br>And this empire is ending<br>Like all the rest<br>Like the Spanish Armada adrift on the sea<br>We’re adrift in the land of the brave <br>And the home of the free<br>Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.</p>
