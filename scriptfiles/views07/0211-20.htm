<p> A  2004 photograph of two stranded polar bears off northern Alaska was released by the Canadian Ice Service last week after a panel of leading world scientists found "unequivocal" evidence for global warming "very likely" caused by human activities. The panel warned that no matter what changes are enacted, further warming and sea level rises will "continue for centuries" because of the long time lags involved in shifting gears on climate processes.

<p> Ellen Mosley-Thompson of OSU's Byrd Polar Research Center estimates that all of Kilimanjaro's ice will be gone by 2020, conceivably leaving the Byrd center's repository of ancient ice cores as the world's only record of 11,000 years of Kilimanjaro ice.

<p>Ohio State University paleocli matologist Lonnie Thompson had just finished photographing the shrinking Quelccaya ice cap in Peru when he noticed a huge patch of matted, brown mossy plants peeking out from the edge of a retreating ice wall.

<p>They looked like wetland plants, out of place beneath a glacier thousands of years old. More importantly, they appeared to have been covered by snow so suddenly that their roots were still in the frozen ground.

<p>Thompson, one of the world's leading experts on tropical mountain glaciers, decided to take samples of the little Andes Mountains plant that August 2002.

<p>The results were astounding.

<p>The moss was radiocarbon-dated at 5,138 years old, give or take 45 years.

<p>And the plants were still so fresh that the initial tests failed when the cellulose disintegrated.

<p>"I got this nasty e-mail saying, 'We don't date things that are modern,' " Thompson laughs. "I told them, 'I don't think it's modern.' "

<p>Halfway around the world, retreating Alpine ice already had yielded up a Copper Age hunter whose remark- ably well-preserved body also dated to between 5,050 and 5,350 years ago. The ice man was so well preserved it was clear he'd also been buried suddenly and then preserved under the ice for thousands of years.

<p>Among the items recovered with the "Oetzi man" were his leggings, bearskin cap, a grass cape, warm grass "socks," waterproof shoes made out of netting and hides, weaponry stained with blood, a recent meal of venison in his stomach and even his pack holding birch-bark fungus medicine for digestive worms and what appeared to be a fire-starting kit.

<p>Suddenly, Thompson - whose work with wife Ellen Mosley-Thompson of OSU's Byrd Polar Research Center typically focuses on clues to climate change in ice cores from all over the world - had a new mystery on his hands: What happened approximately 5,200 years ago that resulted in such abrupt cooling?

<p>In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he concludes the shift was "widespread" and "coincident with structural changes in several civilizations."

<p>These include the sudden appearance of hierarchical societies in the Near East and a shift from hunter-gathering to more communal life in valleys and along coasts.

<p>"Over in the Natural History Museum in London, there are a couple of clay tablets - one from Syria and another from what is now Iraq - that talk about very large floods and cities being destroyed at this time," Thompson says.

<p>Now the mystery may be, what caused an abrupt climate shift that altered the way people live on continents thousands of miles apart?

<p>Certainly it wasn't man-made - unlike today's scientific consensus about the root of the warming that will probably see 11,000-year-old ice caps vanish from Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro within the next two decades.

<p>Maybe it was a 5,200-year-old cataclysm, like a meteor impact.

<p>Thompson said this theory is supported by the discovery of deeply churned sea sediments in Madagascar, apparently dredged up by a huge tsunami 5,000 years ago.

<p>But if it's not cataclysmic, it could be an example of something far more troubling: the abrupt climate thresholds many experts worry today's world faces, whereby gradual shifts in climate suddenly hit a place beyond which the alterations become sudden, swift and devastating.

<p>At that point, the debate about whether man-made global warming is "real" becomes moot. It won't matter who or what is causing it. It just matters that it's happening.

<p>Actually, for scientists, that's already the case. The latest worldwide consensus finds greater than 90 percent likelihood that burning fossil fuels and other human activity are behind accelerating global warming that may take centuries to undo - once humankind finds the will to try to change ingredients in the giant climatic stew pot.

<p>It's just that the scientists have gotten there first. The two Thompsons, both 58, say they are fortunate to have been able to work for decades, on at least five continents, with other scientists who see no national boundaries.

<p>"Without international cooperation, we would have never had our ice cores from China, we would never have our ice cores from South America," says Mosley-Thompson.

<p>"For this issue of climate change, it's essential that we be able to communicate freely across national boundaries," Lonnie Thompson adds. "Only by working globally can we fingerprint the change that's taken place."

<p>One day, he says, everyone will recognize the need and will dedicate their skills and resources to fixing them.

<p>Thompson says people are like that - they must believe in the urgency of a problem in order to "come together to overcome that problem."

<p>Maybe, just like it was 5,200 years ago.
