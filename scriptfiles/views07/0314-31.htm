<p>Henry Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, may have
outdone even his own boss, George W. Bush, for sheer
oracular idiocy.  Bush, of course, set the standard
with his laughable “Mission Accomplished” stunt
concerning Iraq in May 2003.  That one’s right up
there with Dick Cheney’s fatuous claim in May 2005
that the Iraqi insurgency was “in its last throes.”  

<p>But Paulson is clearly angling to get into the game. 
His entry was filed just over a week ago when he
proclaimed, “The economy is as strong as I have seen
it at any time in my 32 year business career.”  This
was uttered two days after a 500+ point plunge in the
stock market.  The market’s slide appears to be only
beginning.  

<p>It is the sheer incongruity of Paulson’s comment that
is so breathtaking.  

<p>The economy lost 3 million manufacturing jobs during
the first six years of Bush’s parlous tenure.  The
housing market is in full-scale meltdown, with prices
falling at the fastest rate in 35 years.  There is no
bottom in sight.  Bush’s tax cuts have forced the
government to borrow more money than any in history: 
more than $3 trillion since he took office.  And with
the nation’s savings rate below zero — the first time
since the Great Depression — he’s had to borrow more
from foreigners than all previous presidents combined.
 

<p>Is this what Paulson means by “the strongest economy
in 32 years”?

<p>Borrowing almost $3 billion every day from the likes
of Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and China, our biggest
industrial competitors, might be called the Blanche
Dubois method of economics:  throwing ourselves on the
mercy of strangers.  It may seem like good policy to
Paulson but it undermines the US’s own financial
sovereignty.  

<p>Those competitors can decide at any minute to shut off
the financial oxygen at which time our economy will
utterly collapse.  That’s what happened in October
1987 when the Japanese closed the spigot on Reagan’s
damaging debt parade, causing the greatest single-day
drop in the stock market since 1929.  It’s not an
accident that the 500+ point meltdown on Wall Street
followed a 9% plunge in the Shanghai stock market the
day before.  

<p>Five million more people are in poverty since Bush
took office.  “Deep” poverty is up 26% to the highest
level in 32 years.  Seven million more people are
without insurance.  Oil prices are almost triple what
they were when Bush took office.  They are slowly but
surely rendering obsolete a vast portion of the U.S.
capital stock, built for a time of much lower prices. 
U.S. automakers have closed more than 20 plants in the
last two years and have paid severances to over
100,000 workers.      

<p>Is this what Paulson means by “the strongest economy
in 32 years”?

<p>Income inequality is the greatest it’s been since the
1920s, just before the Great Depression.  This is why
Bush has to run such massive deficits:  the American
people simply don’t have enough money any more to
clear the markets of goods.  They’ve had to hock their
houses with second and third mortgages to try to
sustain a lifestyle they can no longer afford but
cannot bear to give up.  Mortgage debt is up over $7
trillion since Bush took office.  But with the housing
bust turning into a full-fledged rout, collapsing home
prices are driving the “wealth effect” in reverse.  It
is wiping out the ephemeral equity millions of
Americans have been counting on to fund their
retirement.    

<p>Speaking of which, Paulson himself was just out on the
road claiming that the government cannot afford the
retirement commitments it has made for decades to Baby
Boomers.  “Entitlements,” Paulson lectured, meaning
payments for Social Security and Medicare, will have
to be reduced. Economist Lawrence Kotlikoff, writing
for the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, recently
stated the U.S. government faces $65 trillion more in
such obligations than it can possibly pay.  B this
measure, he argues, the U.S. government may already be “actuarially bankrupt.” 

<p>The annual trade deficit has exploded from $377
billion when Bush took office to $763 billion last
year, giving foreigners more that $3 trillion of
additional claims on U.S. properties.  Foreigners
already own more than 20% of all U.S. assets.  The
deficit with China alone topped $230 billion last
year.  The nation’s infrastructure — the network of
roads, bridges, ports, water systems, etc. — on which
the entire economy rests and operates, has been
downgraded from “D+” to “D” status by the American
Society of Civil Engineers.  Meanwhile, we lavish
close to a trillion dollars a year on various forms of
military spending and wars of choice.  

<p>Is this what Paulson means by, “the strongest economy
in 32 years”?

<p>Of course, from Paulson’s privileged vantage, as one
of the financial titans of his age, things actually
are going great.  Corporate profits are at their
highest share of national income since 1948.  The top
1% of income earners — those Bush calls his “base” —
saw their average pay increase by $146,000 last year. 
(Yes, that’s just the increase.)   Bush’s policies
have engorged the coffers of the weapons makers, pharmaceutical, and oil companies, all traditional Republican constituencies.  

<p>Higher economy-wide interest rates borne of higher
economy-wide debt have shifted trillions of dollars
from hard-strapped borrowers to elated lenders,
Paulson’s brethren.  And investment banking giant
Goldman Sachs, where Paulson most recently served as
CEO, just announced a 29% increase in profits, to $3.2
billion for the quarter.  What’s not to like?  

<p>Paulson’s divinations about the rosy state of the
economy have about them the same delusional detachment
that Marie Antoinette displayed at the Paris bread
riots in 1789.  Told by her handmaids why the women
were rioting, she famously replied, “Let them eat
cake.”  Of course, she, being only 14 years old,
didn’t remember Louis XV’s ominous prophecy of only 15
years before:  “Apre moi, le deluge.”  After me, the
deluge.  Paulson almost surely doesn’t remember it
either.  He should.
