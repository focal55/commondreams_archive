<p>Television producers John Langley, John Walsh and Chris Hansen may be the 
most dangerous men in America today. Langley is the producer of "COPS," Walsh, 
the creator of "America's Most Wanted," and Hansen, the correspondent for 
MSNBC's "To Catch a Predator." Collectively, they are point-people in a 
television genre acclimating Americans to a general dismemberment of 
once-cherished civil rights. On Wednesday, Jan. 10, the latest in police 
reality-television shows, "Armed & Famous," debuts on CBS. The show takes La 
Toya Jackson, Erik Estrada and others of American television's "B" celebrity 
list, gives them police training, and sends them out into the nation's 
dangerous streets to further blur the distinction between law enforcement and 
entertainment. 
<P>What is so pernicious about "Armed & Famous," "COPS," "America's Most 
Wanted," "To Catch a Predator," "S.W.A.T." and other of this criminal vérité 
programming? It is that they have helped set a national tone in which both the 
police and the policed have been convinced that appropriate law-enforcement 
correlates with high-speed chases, blocking and tackling, drawn weapons, and a 
shoot-first, think-later mind set. What connects November's "bust-in" killing 
of 88-year-old Kathryn Johnston in Atlanta with the slaying of bridegroom Sean 
Bell in Queens, N.Y., that same month is that both fell from fusillades fired 
by undercover police squads clearly doing more shooting than thinking. 
<P>That both Johnson and Bell were African Americans illuminates again the 
separate-but-unequal-law-enforcement system under which America still labors. 
In recent years, however, law enforcement has evolved into more of an equal 
opportunity destroyer, with high-impact policing increasingly intruding into 
the lives of Americans of every hue. Black and white substantiation of this 
trend came last month in a truly chilling report by the U.S. Justice 
Department, which disclosed that the United States now has both the largest 
prison population and highest rate of incarceration in the world, with 1 in 32 
American adults enmeshed in the criminal-justice system. 
<P>In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a by-the-book, 
nothing-but-the-book regime of law enforcement is supplanting gentler, more 
discretionary varieties of civil-dispute resolution. Not so long ago, local 
cops had the authority to take the car keys from a tipsy, mortgage-paying 
citizen and drive him or her home. A deputy sheriff might confiscate a couple 
of joints from a high-school student and send her off with a warning. 
Confronting a marital dispute, community-savvy beat cops could decide to walk 
angry mates to different corners of the house and allow emotions to cool. 
Police stops then did not seem, as they do now, to be confrontations chilled by 
the potential for misunderstanding and even bloodshed. 
<P>Today, across America, there is a growing schism between police and the 
communities they are sworn to serve. Nor is the lot of today's sworn officer a 
happy one. Police today are caught in a dangerous socio-political riptide: If 
they exercise too blunt a force, they may end up getting themselves and others 
unnecessarily injured or killed. If they are too soft, their departments risk 
landing in the crosshairs of get-tougher-on-crime victim's rights 
organizations, stirred up by daily doses of reality crime shows such as "COPS." 
<P>"COPS" has wormed its way into the marrow of American cultural life since 
it first aired in March 1989, with more than 600 shows featuring nearly 150 
different police and sheriff departments. The program has grossed more than  
$200 million in syndication and, along with its fugitive-tracking sibling, 
"America's Most Wanted," made Saturday evening crime and punishment night on 
the Fox Network. 
<P>"COPS" has succeeded spectacularly because it takes us on a titillating 
ride through trash-heap America. In those blighted, benighted streets, the 
poor, emotionally maimed, drug-addicted and merely addled, are pulled over, 
spreadeagled, cuffed, bullied, then made to jump through the hoops of 
criminal-law enforcement for our viewing pleasure. As "COPS' " Langley 
explained to an interviewer, the popularity of the show derives from "the 
adrenaline rush of not knowing what would happen at any time." So culturally 
hungry have we become for the kick of televised police chases, dramatic arrests 
and victim-ventilating psychodrama, that even the miscreants themselves seem 
untroubled at signing the releases allowing their generally imbecilic actions 
and law-enforcement reactions to be broadcast on national television. 
<P>What is so harmful about this mixture of real-life street tragedy and 
low-rent entertainment is that "COPS" and its brethren reduce our resistance to 
the kind of dehumanized ultra-violence that Anthony Burgess hypothesized in his 
then-seemingly satiric 1962 novel "A Clockwork Orange." 

<P>MSNBC's "To Catch a Predator" has a more focused, and perhaps an even more 
insidious intent, than "COPS." It aims at the cyberspace enticement of sexual 
predators. These online Lotharios may think they are in for a little under-age 
sex, but when they show up at the anonymous suburban split-level, the sting is 
sprung. Instead of 14-year-old Tiffany, it is Chris Hansen appearing in the 
name of us all to extract a humiliating confession. In his role as video Grand 
Inquisitor, Hansen also acts as agent for the swarm of cops lurking just 
outside waiting to take down the now-unmasked perv and haul him off to jail. 
<P>It is about as easy to defend the scummy subjects of "To Catch a Predator" 
as it is to try to justify drunken driving. Yet, isn't the chiseled, commanding 
Hansen acting an equally scummy role, engaging in the kind of fishing 
expedition that should be repugnant to those who recognize moral and 
constitutional danger in the dirty art of entrapment? This is especially so 
when that entrapment is designed first of all as popular entertainment. 
<P>The last word, however, on "To Catch a Predator"  --  that it "has done 
more than any law we can create"  --  came from a former Florida member of 
Congress named Mark Foley, a man who apparently knows more than a little about 
online predation. 
<P>A similarly chilling illustration of the growing acceptance of  --  or at 
least acquiescence to  --  escalating police use of force, are the cop shows 
lionizing America's special weapons & tactics (SWAT) squads, a law-enforcement 
trend ascendant since the 1980s. Together, the Arts & Entertainment Network's 
Kansas City "S.W.A.T.," Dallas "S.W.A.T.," and Detroit "S.W.A.T.," culturally 
consecrates activities that have historically been the province of the military 
engagements in places where the Bill of Rights do not apply. Deconstruct the 
following bit of copy on the A&E Web site: "Do you have what it takes to talk 
the talk with the toughest officers in law enforcement? Before suiting up, take 
a look at this list of lingo designed to help civilians hang tight with members 
of SWAT." 
<P>This puffery, like the shows themselves, invites us to celebrate the 
Heckler & Koch machine pistols, Parker-Hale Model 85 sniper rifles, flash-bang 
grenades, armored personnel carriers and other paraphernalia of what is 
essentially infantry war-fighting transferred to American streets. What makes 
the phenomenon especially scary is that the SWAT mentality bases itself on that 
fundamental soldierly paradigm that divides the world into friend and foe.  
<P>For today's SWAT teams, the enemy is often us, and the kind of 50-round 
barrage that killed Sean Bell or the fatal kick-in-the-door assault by police 
into the home of Kathryn Johnston, becomes numbingly normal. What do we do, 
short of throwing up our arms and surrendering to the inevitability of 
militarized domestic police forces? First, a de-escalation of the continuing 
domestic law-enforcement arms race might be a place to begin. 
<P>A 1999 Cato Institute study found that between 1995 and 1997 alone, the 
U.S. Defense Department passed along 1.2 million items of military equipment to 
domestic police forces. Fueled by this largesse, thousands of American towns 
and cities such as Fresno, Germantown, Tenn., and Sunrise, Fla., now support 
SWAT teams. There is a self-propagating aspect to the spread of SWAT teams: To 
justify the added expense of a paramilitary force, there is a continual push to 
expand its role into the realm of daily policing. Thus is laid the 
institutional groundwork for Johnston and Bell-style confrontations in which 
overwhelming force and military rules of engagement are the catalyst for 
unnecessary tragedy. 
<P>Along with de-escalation, police tactics need to de-emphasize automatic 
weapons, sniper rifles and carved-in-stone procedures in favor of policies that 
are friendlier and less likely to get our fellow citizens, either police or 
civilians, killed. It might not be a bad idea, as well, to enter into 
disarmament talks with the television executives, producers and reporters, who 
have worked so cannily to inculcate the "COPS," "America's Most Wanted," "To 
Catch a Predator," "S.W.A.T."  --  and now, "Armed & Famous"  --  mentality 
that is contributing to making America a deadlier, if marginally more 
entertaining, place.
