<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> Several months ago, I shocked my Peacenik brethren by saying that despite my early opposition to the war in Iraq I did not think we should pull out. Like Hillary, I had my reasons.

<p>To abandon the Iraqis to a chaos of our making would be less than honorable, I said, and if that chaos enveloped the Middle East, it could a produce a disaster of historic proportions. The stakes were too high to pull out without giving the effort a fair chance.

<p>You see, at the time, I thought we still had a chance of success in Iraq, an outside chance to be sure, but a chance. I no longer think that.

<p>The latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) dragged me into reality on the Iraq war.

<p>The NIE is no mere think-tank opinion, you understand; it is the consensus judgment of all U.S. intelligence agencies. And the judgment is bleak.

<p>“Iraqi society’s growing polarization, the persistent weakness of the security forces and the state in general, and all sides’ ready recourse to violence are collectively driving an increase in communal and insurgent violence and political extremism,” the report stated.

<p>But…“even if violence is diminished, given the current winner-take-all attitude and sectarian animosities infecting the political scene, Iraqi leaders will be hard-pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation.”

<p>In English, that means putting a stop to the bombings, shootings and kidnappings will be hard, dangerous work and even if we get it done, there is little chance order will last.

<p>That’s it for me, kids. Count me out. I quit.

<p>This misbegotten war is lost. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars building the best-trained, best-equipped army in the history of humankind and we have contrived to put it in a hopeless situation.

<p>It takes talent to do that. No wonder they used to call Bush’s foreign policy advisers “the dream team.”

<p>They tell us we can’t leave because of the afore-mentioned catastrophic result. But staying will produce the same catastrophe, only with more American soldiers being killed, maimed and scarred for life.  They also tell us that if Congress votes to cut off funds for the war or merely registers its disapproval, it will harm the morale of the troops.

<p>Nonsense. You know what really hurts morale? It’s coming to the end of your tour of duty and having that tour extended.

<p>Show me a soldier in combat who doesn’t know, to the hour, how much time he or she has before it’s time to go home. It is a cruel joke to have that day pushed back at the last moment. And that’s what we’re doing.

<p>If I were running things, I’d call in the warring factions of Iraq and say: “We had a good idea here---democracy and all---but you guys screwed it up. We’re going to go fight terrorism someplace else and spend the money we’re spending here on making the United States safer.

<p>“Adios chumps.” Then we could get on with the business of ending the war with Iran. What? We’re not at war with Iran, you say? You couldn’t prove it by the stuff coming out of the White House and Pentagon of late.

<p>Last week, in a series of hush-hush anonymous briefings, we stated we had proof that Iran was supplying Iraqi insurgents with armor-piercing explosives and other weapons.

<p>It could be true. Governments do this sort of thing. We did it ourselves when President Reagan’s boys sold arms to Iran in order to fund the Contra insurgents in Nicaragua. But how can you tell? This could as easily be another Dick Cheney fantasy made flesh.

<p>This administration has cooked the books on every issue it’s laid its hand on, from the war to global warming to stem cell research to Social Security.

<p>You think it wouldn’t bend the truth a little in order to gin up a war with a charter member of the Axis of Evil?

<p>Oh, please.
