<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Justice in Iraq has not been served by Saddam Hussein's execution, and 
more, not less violence, is the likely outcome of this vengeful and unwise act. 
Hussein was a cruel tyrant, and no doubt was culpable for many heinous crimes  
--  including, possibly, those for which he was convicted and hanged. 
<P>But he was rushed to trial well before the Iraqi legal system, which had 
crumbled through years of Baath party rule, had regained the capacity to fairly 
and effectively administer a complex international criminal trial. The case 
arose from the summary executions of 148 men and boys from Dujail, a Shiite 
Muslim village northwest of Baghdad, after a 1982 assassination attempt there 
against Hussein, the Sunni Muslim president. Hussein and his co-defendants were 
not the direct perpetrators of the killings, but were alleged to be instigators 
and planners. Hence, the case raised intricate issues of criminal 
responsibility, and involved special forensic challenges due to the age of the 
evidence. Such a trial would be a challenge for a healthy legal system, let 
alone one that had suffered decrepitude and many years' isolation from the 
international legal system. 
<P>Hussein and his co-defendants were brought before a tribunal that had 
originally been constituted through a 2003 order of the U.S.-led Coalition 
Provisional Authority. The CPA  --  and the Iraqis  --  insisted on Iraqi-led 
proceedings, instead of a mixed or purely international tribunal, that would 
have drawn on the expertise of experienced international lawyers and judges. 
American lawyers provided the tribunal only non-binding advice.  
<P>More reliable and fair mechanisms were sacrificed for political goals: to 
rejuvenate the Iraqi legal system; to speedily dispatch Hussein and thereby 
deflate the Sunni insurgency seeking his return to power; and, perhaps, to 
deprive the defendants of the wider pulpit an international tribunal would have 
afforded. 
<P>The result was predictable: a trial seriously marred by irregularities 
that undermined the integrity of the verdict. Three defense attorneys were 
murdered during the proceedings, and a fourth was abducted and wounded. Intense 
political pressure was exerted on the court, leading to the mid-trial 
resignation of the presiding judge. Prosecutors were recurrently late or failed 
to provide the defense with evidence, including some that was exculpatory. 
Human Rights Watch carefully monitored the trial, and reported serious gaps in 
the evidence against the accused.  
<P>The case already echoed the Sunni-Shiite sectarian struggle that is 
tearing Iraq asunder. Nothing in the administration of the trial diminished 
that resonance. This year, the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha began on Saturday for 
Sunnis, and Sunday for Shiites. When the judge representing the Iraqi tribunal 
was told that Hussein's Saturday execution would violate an Iraqi law barring 
such actions on holidays, he allegedly snapped: "Sunday is the official 
beginning of Eid al-Adha." Hussein's executioners, by dialect and skin tone 
discernibly Shiite, taunted and cursed him in his final moments. 
<P>A scrupulously fair trial for Hussein could have edified the legal system 
within Iraq, and fortified the principle of accountability for violations of 
human rights everywhere. Instead, it affirms that the institutions of the Iraqi 
state are still the instruments of sectarian vengeance, only with the tables 
turned. 
<P>People in the region are likely to remember that many of Hussein's most 
terrible crimes  --  including the launching of an aggressive war against Iran 
that consumed nearly a million Iraqi and Iranian lives  --  were committed with 
the active support of the United States. They will also contrast U.S. 
sponsorship of the Hussein trial with our government's 2003 role in suspending 
the investigation of a Belgian court into then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon's culpability in the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacres. Up to 2,000 
Palestinian and Lebanese civilians were slaughtered by Israel's Lebanese 
allies, acts for which Sharon's own government had held him indirectly 
responsible. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, primarily concerned 
over possible prosecutions of U.S. officials for war crimes in Iraq, threatened 
to move NATO headquarters from Belgium if the law establishing that country's 
jurisdiction for the case were not changed. Soon thereafter, the case against 
Sharon was put on indefinite hold. 
<P>Many will say that the real offense for which Hussein paid with his life 
was not the mass killings that he likely ordered, but that he eventually 
crossed the United States. Is that the lesson that we wish the world to draw: 
It's our way, or the gallows?
