<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>It is, perhaps, premature to think about what form a memorial for the War on Iraq ought to take. Who knows how all this will turn out? War memorials are constructed after the event, from a suitable, historical distance, from high ground in the present that affords a panoramic vista of the calamitous, past events. Unless we construct reminders as we look back --- a plaque bolted, a statue erected, a tree planted, a monument carved --- the galloping present rides roughshod over the past, dispersing it like a cloud of dust. This is what happened. Blood was spilled. We struggled on, both standing straighter and more bent because of our witness.
  
<p>So it may not be only premature but also presumptuous to imagine an Iraq memorial now. But the problem with most memorials is that they are used to obscure history rather than honor it, romanticize and sentimentalize rather than enlighten. Often they are a continuation of the process by which people in power distort reality to achieve their ends --- justifying an unnecessary, immoral use of violence through the heroics of the people who were forced to perform it. In fact, people of wealth and power use memorials to enable the repetition of history, not to encourage learning from it. Thus, I think, it’s not too soon to conceptualize an Iraq memorial that tells the truth about history and offers a cautionary tale to the future. One that memorializes the truth rather than blows dust in our eyes.

<p>The partial exception to what I just said is Maya Lin’s great memorial to the Vietnam War --- The Wall. It is like a black boomerang that spins back perpetually to slice into our hearts and minds. It is a cut flensed into the flesh of the earth like the wound stabbed into Christ’s side. It refuses to heal. It’s an open grave. It’s a prone black comma isolated from any previous or concluding clause. It is one of our greatest memorials because it rejects the false comfort of patriotism, celebrating instead the camaraderie of death and the weight of grief --- the hard polished, granite fact of death.  So polished that one’s tears and anger shine back through the carved names of the dead reflecting one’s sad and loving and helpless face. It honors the purity and equality of grief rather than the disputations of history and politics. 

<p>But, therein lies its flaw.

<p>The Wall assigns no blame, tells no history except what one brings to it. It isolates grief from accountability. It teaches us that dead soldiers are an inevitable fact of the human condition. It doesn’t tell our children that all these memorialized names were the cost of presidential lies and leaders who worshiped imperialism more than humanity. It doesn’t tell us that this need not have been, that history at any moment can be shaped to good or bad ends. It doesn’t tell us that these dead were the collateral damage, as surely as three million Vietnamese, of a political and economic system that had betrayed them. That, in fact, they died in vain.

<p>So, I’ve been mulling over a memorial for the Iraq War. The project will begin by naming the crime. The monument will be named a Memorial for the Attack on Iraq. From a distance it will look like an enormous bronze culvert lying on a flat field of grass waiting to be buried in the earth to channel a river under a road. Or, to some, it might resemble a discarded missile silo on its side, the hollowed out trunk of a giant redwood, the dark throat of a cannon’s barrel or a huge flute. Some people might be reminded of a birth canal. That would be good. It is meant to be traveled through. 

<p>Beside its dark mouth will be a simple plaque that reads: When men and women join the military and become soldiers, they sign a sacred pledge to defend the Constitution and the people of the United States of America with their lives. They also agree to take on their consciences the burden of killing and wounding other human beings in the fulfillment of their duty. Their government agrees, in its part of the sacred pledge, to demand these responsibilities of soldiers only when absolutely necessary for the survival of the country. A soldier who, having signed the pledge, refuses to fulfill his or her duty may be prosecuted at the government’s discretion. Equally, a soldier has the responsibility to refuse an unlawful or immoral order. And a government that requires sacrifice when none was necessary may also be prosecuted.

<p>A person entering the canal and adjusting to the dimness will see that the only source of light is a series of small reading lamps arcing like half moons from the curved walls. Each lamp will illuminate a quotation in raised bronze letters. The letters of the words will be raised to encourage people to run their fingers over them. The rubbing of many fingers will bring up a luster as bright as gold.

<p>The first, on the right, about five feet above the floor, might be, <i>We have it in our  power to begin the world over again. </i>--- Thomas Paine.
<p>And then, on the opposite wall, <i>The degree to which you resist injustice is the degree to which you are free. </i>--- Utah Phillips.
<p>Next to this one would be, <i>When one comes to think of it, there are no such things as divine, immutable, or inalienable rights. Rights are things we get when we are strong enough to make good our claim on them. </i>--- Helen Keller
<p>A bit further, on the same wall, <i>The contention that a standing army and navy is the best security of peace is about as logical as the claim that the most peaceful citizen is he who goes about heavily armed. The experience of every-day life fully proves that the armed individual is invariably anxious to try his strength. The same is historically true of governments. Really peaceful countries do not waste life and energy in war preparations, with the result that peace is maintained. </i>--- Emma Goldman
<p>On the opposite wall will be, <i>You have not been mistaken in supposing my views and feeling to be in favor of the abolition of war. </i>--- Thomas Jefferson.
<p>Next to Jefferson, it will be appropriate to have the words of a former slave, <i>Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong that will be imposed on them.</i> --- Frederick Douglass.

<p>A little further on  the quotes will become more specific,  <i>Just as an unbalanced mind can accumulate stresses that can grow and take on a life of their own, so little decisions of our modern life can accumulate to the point where our society finds itself bombing other people for their oil, or supporting dictators who torture whole populations—all so that our unbalanced interests might be served. </i>--- Doris “Granny D.” Haddock
<p>
And, <i>The most alarming sign of the state of our society now is that our leaders have the courage to sacrifice the lives of young people in war but have not the courage to tell us that we must be less greedy and wasteful. --- Wendell Berry
And, Now, we’ve got to get this thing right. What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.
It is precisely this collision of immoral power with powerless morality which constitutes the major crisis of our times.</i>--- Martin Luther King, Jr.
<p>And, from Howard Zinn, <i>No flag is large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.

</i>
<p>And, <i>Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. The world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hope of its children…This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. </i>--- Dwight Eisenhower
<p>Also from Eisenhower, <i>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.</i>
<p>And, <i>Why so much war? Because war is a profitable enterprise. George W. Bush and his people can hold forth about the wonders of democracy and peace, and can condemn worldwide violence in solemn tones.  Until the United States stops being the world's largest arms dealer, these words from our government absolutely reek of hypocrisy. </i>--- William Rivers Pitt
<p>And, <i>The war against Iraq is as disastrous as it is unnecessary; perhaps in terms of its wisdom, purpose and motives, the worst war in American history…. Our military men and women…were not called to defend America but rather to attack Iraq. They were not called to die for, but rather to kill for, their country. What more unpatriotic thing could we have asked of our sons and daughters…? </i>--- William Sloane Coffin
<p>And, <i>George, your reckless and wanton foreign policies killed my son, Spc. Casey Austin Sheehan, in the illegal and unjust war on Iraq. Helping to bring about your political downfall will be the most  noble accomplishment of my life, and it will bring justice for my son and the hundreds of other brave Americans and tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis your lies have killed. </i>--- Cindy Sheehan
<p>And, the final quote would be the same one as at the beginning, <i>We have it in our  power to begin the world over again. </i>--- Thomas Paine.
<p>The walls would be lined with quotes like these. And many more. Of course, at this point, it’s merely an idea, a suggestion, an imagined artifact. And I know nothing like this will ever be built. Nonetheless, at the end of this tunnel will be a more intense light. There should always be an intense light at the end of a tunnel. This one should be shining from above, over a floor to ceiling mirror that one must confront and pass by, to the right or left, in order to exit.
