<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Today is the 70th anniversary of the beginning of 
the bombardment of the city of Barcelona during 
the Spanish Civil War by the Italian battleship 
Eugenio di Savoia. The target was an airplane 
motor factory three blocks from the small 
apartment where my family is now living. None of 
the shells hit the factory. They hit residential 
areas instead, killing eighteen civilians.

<p>Barcelona was the first modern European city to 
suffer what we euphemistically call "collateral 
damage." It also was first to suffer intentional 
bombardment of civilian populations, a practice 
later used widely by Axis and Allied governments 
during World War II. Barcelona was bombed 170 
times between 1937 and 1939, leaving 2,500 people 
dead. Francisco Franco gave the German Condor 
Legion permission to practice terrorist bombing 
on the Basque town of Guernica in April 1937.

<p>The newspaper La Vanguardia shows an aerial 
photograph of the Italian air strike on March 17, 
1938, that leveled two city blocks of Barcelona. 
It was ordered by dictator Benito Mussolini in 
reprisal for the defeat of Italian ground troops 
elsewhere in Spain.

<p>A city map in La Vanguardia shows where bombs 
hit. Two buildings on our block were blown up. A 
nearby stone building front still shows the 
damage of fragmentation bombs. Seven citizens 
reminisce in the newspaper about living for two 
years under bombardment as children. One said she 
still reacts with fear at ambulance or police 
sirens.

<p>Residents here have vivid memories and reminders 
of the destructive force of war and of a fascist 
regime that violated the human rights of its own 
men, women and children. This may explain why the 
Spanish government is sensitive about events in 
Iraq and Afghanistan and concerned whether 
international safeguards for the protection of 
prisoners are being observed.

<p>The newspaper El Pais recently reported that the 
U.S. government and military used Spanish bases 
at Roto, Morón and Torrejón to fly illegally 
detained suspected terrorists to Guantánamo. This 
violated international law and bilateral 
agreements with the Spanish government.

<p>Popular political cartoonist Peridis played upon 
Spanish Roman Catholic tradition in a cartoon 
showing a seated man facing a seated woman. She 
holds a rosary. The woman sings the Latin 
response that I sang as a young altar boy: "Pray 
for us." The man sings the priest's part, but 
instead of the names of holy saints, he chants 
the names of unholy places: Rota - Guantánamo / 
Ora pro nobis. Morón - Guantánamo / Ora Pro 
Nobis. He then remarks, "All roads lead to 
Guantánamo." And she replies, "Wasn't it to Rome?"

<p>The former president of Spain, who committed 
troops to Iraq in 2003, recently admitted there 
were no weapons of mass destruction. This 
prompted the current president, José Luis 
Rodríguez Zapatero, to comment ironically, "Even 
now he is mistaken. There is a weapon of mass 
destruction in Iraq: war and the hatred it has 
promoted."

<p>American policies cast a less than favorable 
light on the values of our society. Last week, 
Spain held a day of "blackout." Citizens and 
institutions did their part to conserve energy in 
a united national response to global warming. 
Even the lights of Barcelona's greatest landmark, 
the spires of Antoni Gaudí's famous church, La 
Sagrada Familia, were dimmed.

<p>In 1997, the United States refused to sign the 
Kyoto Protocol, citing among its supposed flaws 
that it placed restrictions on developed 
countries that it did not place on developing 
ones. We continue to export our Hummer-SUV 
lifestyle. And I continue to explain to Spanish 
friends that Austin has no significant train or 
Metro systems.

<p>Still, most baffling was our recent refusal to 
join in the proclamation made by 58 nations at a 
UNICEF-organized conference against the use of 
children as soldiers in combat. The European 
Union, Switzerland, Canada and Japan signed the 
proclamation, but - as was widely noted in the 
Spanish news - not the United States.

<p>In June 2005, President Bush called upon longtime 
adviser Karen Hughes to help give the United 
States' image an extreme makeover. Whatever she 
did, if anything, sure hasn't worked.
