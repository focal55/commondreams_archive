<P><em>[T]here are people in Washington … who never intend to withdraw military forces from Iraq and they’re looking for ten, 20, 50 years in the future … the reason that we went into Iraq was to establish a permanent military base in thegulf region, and I have never heard any of our leaders say that they would commit themselves  to the Iraqi people that ten years from now there will be no military bases of the United States in Iraq.<br>
</em>–Former President Jimmy Carter (Feb. 3, 2006)</P>
<P>It is difficult to believe that with the U.S. establishment having all but conceded defeat in Iraq, and with the Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group having signaled that the United States needs the help of its rivals Iran and Syria – as well as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other influential Middle Eastern nations – to contain the Iraqi civil war, the U.S. is still pursuing the war and building permanent military bases in the disintegrating nation. Yet, this is precisely what the Pentagon is doing.</P>
<P>Their reasoning is simple: the geostrategic stakes are high. Given history and the importance of Middle East oil, Iraq has become what Eqbal Ahmad used to call “the geopolitical center of the struggle for world power.”</P>
<P>A century ago, as petroleum-fueled internal combustion machines revolutionized the global economy and military, Middle East oil reserves became what Winston Churchill described as “The Prize” of World War I. With a secret agreement (the Sykes-Picot Treaty), the British and French governments divided the region between their empires. World War II accelerated the decline and collapse of European colonialism, and by 1944 the State Department was reporting that the United States had won “one of the greatest material prizes in world history.”</P>
<P>Seen as the equivalent of “New World” gold and silver, which had financed Europe’s global conquests and the Industrial Revolution, Middle East oil would serve as a pillar of U.S. post-war global hegemony. This remains the case today as the world approaches peak oil production, and with the voracious appetites of China’s and India’s surging economies, the U.S. is increasingly on the defensive in its efforts to continue dominating control of energy sources.</P>
<P>Washington’s current pursuit of permanent military bases in Iraq is not an aberration. During the past six decades, the U.S. has constructed a network of military bases and access agreements that extends across North Africa, to Persian Gulf nations and Turkey, and onward to the atoll of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, whose Chagos people have been driven from paradise to make way for U.S. bombers and pre-positioned munitions. U.S. troops and bases in Europe, ostensibly assigned to NATO, have also helped to enforce U.S. Middle East hegemony, as have U.S. subversion, coups d’etat, and threats to initiate nuclear war.</P>
<P>President Bush, the elder, wasn’t kidding when he said that the Desert Storm war was fought to create “a new world order” in which “what we say goes.” It permitted the U.S. to reconsolidate its control over Middle East oil reserves. Bombing Iraq into the “pre-industrial age” served as a warning to all who might challenge U.S. dominance. It also provided the U.S. the necessary rationales to expand and to revitalize its infrastructure of military bases across the Middle East. Thousands of U.S. warriors and their fearsome weapons were dispatched to Saudi Arabia. Kuwait was occupied with air fields, munitions depots, and training grounds. U.S. bases and other elements of U.S. military infrastructure in Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates were post-modernized.</P>
<P>The “swap” from Saudi Arabia to Iraq</P>
<P>In much the same way that the “abuses and usurpations” committed by King George III’s “standing armies” in England’s North American colonies were denounced in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, Osama bin Laden and others experienced the presence of U.S. troops and bases near Mecca and Medina, Islam’s holiest cities, and elsewhere in Saudi Arabia as demeaning. These were unacceptable sacrileges. Bin Laden’s 1998 fatwa calling for their withdrawal put Washington and the Saudi monarchy on notice. Al Qaida’s murderous assaults against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon finally led the Bush administration to take bin Laden seriously.</P>
<P>As Brigadier General Robert Pollman has since explained, “It ma[de] a lot of logical sense” to “swap” U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia for new bases in Iraq. Using preparations for the 2003 invasion of Iraq as political cover, nearly all U.S. troops and most of the Pentagon’s military infrastructure were pulled out of Saudi Arabia. Qatar now hosts the Combined Air Command Center. Thousands of U.S. troops are based in Kuwait, where they are trained, have easy access to the model supply base at Doha, and can support military operations in Iraq. But the greatest part of the infrastructure has been redeployed to Iraq.</P>
<P>The Baker-Hamilton Study Group functionally endorses the Pentagon’s “Go Long” strategy, which envisions 50,000 to 60,000 troops – including one-tenth of the U.S. Army – remaining in Iraq “for years to come.” This helps to explain why the Pentagon is continuing to spend nearly $1 billion a year to build and expand military bases in Iraq. As Major General Allen G. Peck, deputy air commander of the U.S. Central Command, put it in May 2006, “We’ll be in the region for the foreseeable future … Our intention would be to stay as long as the host nations will have us.”</P>
<P>The invasion of Iraq was thus rooted in more than neoconservative fantasies of imposing liberal democracy and a neoliberal economic system on Iraq. It was designed to transform the oil-rich nation into an unsinkable U.S. aircraft carrier from which U.S. attacks and military interventions could be launched to “discipline” oil-rich Iran, Syria, and others who might challenge U.S. regional hegemony, terrorizing potential rivals – including indigenous insurgents – with high-tech and potentially nuclear “shock and awe” destruction.</P>
<P>An imperial infrastructure</P>
<P>Post-invasion, the U.S. military established 110 bases in Iraq. By spring 2006 the Pentagon had “reduced the size of its footprint” by consolidating them into approximately 75 bases across the country. As authority is turned over to the central government in Baghdad or seized by competing Shi’a, Sunni, and Kurdish mini-states, the Pentagon is working feverishly to further consolidate the U.S. military presence to 14 “enduring bases” in Northern Iraq (Kurdistan), Baghdad, Anbar province (home to Sunni Fallujah, Ramadi, and Tikrit), and Shi’a-dominated southern approaches to Baghdad.</P>
<P>Organized around airfields “to facilitate resupply operations and troop mobility,” the major bases in Baghdad include: Camp Victory at the airport, which hosts as many as 14,000 U.S. troops; Anaconda Air Base, just north of Baghdad, which spreads across 15 square miles and is being built for 20,000 U.S. troops; Camp Falcon / Al Sarq, which will accommodate 5,000 U.S. soldiers; and the so-called U.S. “embassy complex” in the Green Zone. There, $1 billion is being spent on a 100-acre installation, comparable to the size of Vatican City, with a Marine barracks, 300 homes, 21 other buildings, and its own electrical, water, and sewage systems.</P>
<P>“Post Freedom,” Camp Marez, and the Mosul Airfield serve the 101st Airborne Division and defend U.S. allies and interests in oil-rich Kurdistan. “Camp Renegade” is an air base “strategically located near the Kirkuk oil fields and the Kirkuk refinery and petrochemical plant.” Tajji, just north of Fallujah, is built on the site of a former Republican Guard “military city” and is replete with the comforts of Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Subway restaurants to make U.S. warriors feel right at home. Camps Speicher and Fallujah are located near Saddam Hussein’s home town of Tikrit and the center of Sunni resistance in Fallujah. Little is known about the other planned “enduring bases.”</P>
<P>How much of this imperial infrastructure will survive the United States’ inevitable defeat in Iraq and the attendant negotiations is anyone’s guess. The peace movement is not alone in calling on the U.S. government to renounce any intention of maintaining bases in Iraq. Both houses of Congress voted last year to declare that the U.S. will not maintain permanent military bases, but this language disappeared from the final legislation. Former President Jimmy Carter and editorial writers across the country have appealed to the Bush-Cheney government to rule out permanent military bases. And, in their Out of Iraq: A Practical Plan for Withdrawal Now former presidential candidate George McGovern and former national crisis manager William Polk warn that “absent an American withdrawal and deactivation of the military bases, the insurgency will almost certainly continue.”</P>
<P>Conversely, calls by former Ambassador Peter Galbraith and Leslie Gelb of the Council on Foreign Relations to recognize “The End of Iraq” and to facilitate its formal division into Kurdish, Shi’a, and Sunni mini-states are not being made simply to limit the devastation of Iraq’s civil war but to preserve as much U.S. power and influence as possible. We also see this motive in the call by Sen. Joseph Biden (chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Democratic presidential candidate) for a federated Iraqi state. His plans envision 20,000 U.S. troops remaining in Kurdistan, with more elsewhere in “Iraq.”</P>
<P>Whether the U.S. retains five or 15 “enduring bases,” its goal is clear: to keep its military hand on the “jugular vein” of global capitalism – as former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Maxwell Taylor described Middle East oil. This requires an intimidating infrastructure of deadly high-tech fortresses and the warriors that go with them.</P>
<P>All U.S. troops must be brought home if there is to be a chance for peace in Iraq. If the region’s nations are to have any hope of finally exercising self-determination, and if the United States wants to regain the trust and support of the international community, its military bases must be closed – quickly and permanently.</P>
