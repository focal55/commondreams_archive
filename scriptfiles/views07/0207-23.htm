<p>Two phone calls this 
		week, one from a liberal magazine, and one from an organization 
		representing female executives, were asking questions about two sides of 
		the same issue: “Best” lists for working women.  You know the ones “100 
		Best Companies for Working Mothers,” “Fifty Best Places for Latinas to 
		Work,” “Best Companies for Diversity,” and so on.  The magazine wanted 
		to know if the lists are of any use to working women at all, or if in 
		fact they do harm.  The female executives wanted to alert  me that 
		Wal-Mart, though facing  the largest sex discrimination lawsuit in 
		history, made their top 30.  Their question was whether a company can be 
good for exec women and lousy for say, cashiers.</p>
<p>It is not only 
		possible, but it may be usual,  for a company to be better for women at 
		the top than those at the bottom.  That’s also true for men. You see 
		plenty of grayhairs in gray suits, riding around in chauffeured limos 
		driven by other guys  who make little more than the minimum wage, often 
		with meager benefits to boot.  The difference is there are still a lot 
		more men than women in those backseats reading the Wall Street Journal 
		and figuring out how to bust the unions. </p>
<p>The bigger question 
		is whether the companies that show up on these lists are worthy of 
		admiration at all.  An example I like to use is a school.  Suppose your 
		kid’s school was named one of the  “Top 100 in the U.S.” by two 
		different scholastic magazines.  You’d be pretty proud, wouldn’t you?  
		Now suppose you learn that the first magazine allowed the schools to 
		rate themselves by sending in descriptions of programs, and they didn’t 
		have to provide data on student performance.  The second magazine did 
		its own rating, but digging a little deeper you find the actual report 
		cards of the students in the ranked schools are abysmal.  The top school 
		comes in with average student grades of  28%, and the lowest rates a 
		miserable 11% average.  Furthermore, the school pays a Vice Principal a 
		full time salary just to fill out forms, buy advertising, and underwrite 
		the magazines’ award ceremony so the school can make the list in the 
		first place.  Still impressed? More likely you’d be outraged.</p>
<p>This scenario happens 
		every day in corporate America.  Diversity Manager is the usual title of 
		our theoretical Vice Principal, and she or he has a big budget to throw 
		around so the company makes the list.  The company buys advertising in 
		the magazine giving the award (or makes an outright donation if it’s an 
		organization with no magazine), and gets to brag about it.  Most are 
		Fortune 500 firms where women are stuck at the bottom, and many are 
		defending themselves in court for sex discrimination (or have paid huge 
		settlements) -- some in the same years they get the awards. </p>
<p>This stuff is far 
		from benign.  I took a look at some publicly available court papers in a 
		sex discrimination filed against the giant consulting company, Deloitte 
		and Touche, and talked to some women in the company.  One told me the 
		company recruiter had touted their “awards” and “Best” listings 
		repeatedly.  Once on board, she realized women never seemed to get 
		promoted, and were systematically winnowed out as time passed.  It gets 
		worse.  When another  woman sued for sex discrimination, Deloitte tried 
		to get the judge to throw the case out – strictly on the grounds that it 
		had made the “100 Best Companies for Working Mothers,” published by 
		Working Mother Magazine.  The female judge said no dice – but who knows 
		what a good-ol’-boy on the bench would have done. </span></p>

		<p>
		The lesson is simple. 
		Women should be extremely wary of what they read about “good” companies 
		if the information is put out by any organization that stands to 
		profit.  And yes, lists can do harm.  Just ask the woman who left a good 
		job to go to what she thought was a better one at one of these firms, 
		only to have to sue for pregnancy discrimination two years later.  It 
		did happen, it does happen, and “Best” lists only make the problem 
		worse. </p>
