<p>WASHINGTON, March 27 — In the summer of 2001, according to witnesses interviewed by the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 hijackings, President Bush was told repeatedly of terror warnings pouring into American intelligence agencies, mostly about threats overseas.</p>
<P>
The director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, who briefed Mr. Bush on threats almost daily, "was around town literally pounding on desks saying that something is happening, this is an unprecedented level of threat information," said Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, who was quoted in a Congressional report last year.</p>
<P>
But even as the warnings spiked in June and July that year, there appeared to be little sense of alarm at the White House,  officials of the Central Intelligence Agency told the  commission.    It was not until Sept. 4 that Mr. Bush's national security team approved a plan intended to eradicate Al  Qaeda and not until Sept. 10 that Mr. Tenet was told to put the plan into effect.</p>
<P>
Now, nearly two and half years later, the issue of whether Mr. Bush and his advisers failed to respond adequately to the threat of terror before Sept. 11, 2001, has become the focus of intense scrutiny and debate in Washington. </p>
<P>
The White House had long hoped to avoid just such a discussion of Mr. Bush's actions before the hijackings, fearing it would draw attention to the first months of his presidency rather than the period after Sept. 11 when he took military action against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. The White House had opposed the creation of the independent commission and for many months cooperated reluctantly with the panel.</p>
<P>
White House fears were realized this  week  when Richard A. Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism coordinator, depicted the first months of the Bush presidency as a time of indecision and inaction on terrorism. Many of the preliminary findings of the commission supported the picture Mr. Clarke outlined in his new book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743260244/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror</a>," published by Free Press. </p>
<P>
Politically, as the presidential campaign rolls forward, a pivotal question is whether that portrait, which the White House worked feverishly to undermine, will raise questions about what has been a fundamental part of his re-election appeal. Mr. Bush is expected to defend his conduct when he answers questions to  be asked by the commission's chairman and vice chairman, assuring continued attention on this phase of his presidency. They will question Mr. Bush   in private for about an hour.      Vice President Dick Cheney has also agreed to answer questions about his activities prior to the attacks. </p>
<P>
On Sunday, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, will appear on "60 Minutes," the CBS program on which Mr. Clarke first criticized his former White House colleagues a week ago.</p>
<P>
The commission is expected to release a report on its finding in late July,  when  the  Democrats will meet  in Boston to nominate Mr. Bush's opponent. </p>
<P>
Mr. Bush has often talked about how his presidency did not, in a real sense, begin until Sept. 11 when, he said, he found in the aftermath of the attacks the defining purpose of his presidency.  Mr. Bush and his aides have made his prosecution of the war on terror the touchstone of his re-election campaign.</p>
<P>
Mr. Bush and his aides say they  believe that his leadership after Sept. 11 created an irrevocable bond with voters that would be nearly impossible to erase and will ultimately overshadow any questions raised about the pre-Sept. 11 period of his presidency.</p>
<P>
Still, they have acknowledged that this would be a very different kind of election had it not been for the attacks, and that any advantage the president enjoys  going into the election is because of that chapter of his presidency. The White House selected the time and place of the convention where Mr. Bush will be nominated — New York City, less than two weeks before the third anniversary of the attacks — with that in mind.</p>
<P>
Several Republicans not associated with the Bush campaign said that they were concerned about the turn of events, warning that  the commission findings and Mr. Clarke's testimony were a challenge to the central pillar of Mr. Bush's campaign appeal: his handling of the Sept. 11 attacks. </p>
<P>
Senator John Kerry, Mr. Bush's likely opponent, has long said that a critical part of his own strategy to defeat Mr. Bush was to at least even the playing field on issues of national security and foreign affairs, and thus move  the presidential debate to the issue of the economy.</p>
<P>
"Let's be as generous as possible," said one Republican strategist, who said he did not want to be quoted by name in criticizing the White House. "If voters believe Clarke, than Bush's greatest strength — his response to terrorism — is significantly eroded. This Clarke stuff is significantly bad for Bush."</p>
<P>
The net effect of the  week's debate has, Mr. Bush's advisers argued, been to at best discredit Mr. Clarke and at worst cloud the issue. "I think in the end, he's not going to have any credibility,"  Charles Black, a Republican consultant with ties to the White House, said of Mr. Clarke. "I think any objective person watching this is going to come away saying this is confusing at best."</p>
<P>
The White House is responding to Mr. Clarke and the commission's findings with a  strategy that includes Ms. Rice's "60 Minutes" appearance. She has made multiple appearances this  week to make a case that she was actively involved in the decision making before Sept. 11. </p>
<P>
Beyond that, Mr. Bush's aides  hope to shift any blame about security shortcomings to the Clinton administration, arguing that the Bush administration was hardly alone in underestimating the potential threat of a domestic terrorist attack and that Mr. Clinton had no success in eliminating Al Qaeda.</p>
<P>
The  White House strategy  also involves what officials said would be a continued effort to discredit Mr. Clarke and to confuse the dispute with a battery of  accusations and counteraccusations intended to increasingly make this dispute appear to be a partisan fight between Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<P>
"Our analysis is that the Democrats were so eager to thrust the 9/11 hearings into the political arena that they resorted to an overreach that kind of ignored some basic facts that the American people know about President Bush," said Nicolle Devenish, Mr. Bush's campaign communications director. "The world was watching in the days and weeks after 9/11."</p>
<P>
A review of the evidence produced this  week provides relatively little direct information about Mr. Bush's thinking, statements or actions regarding terrorism in the months after he took office. The commission's reports suggest that he left the issue largely to top advisers, who studied it, but took no concrete action against Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden.</p>
<P>
The commission's reports show that Mr. Bush was warned repeatedly about terrorist threats, but they provide no indication that he urged his aides to accelerate their policy review or produce specific plans in response to the warnings,  from outgoing Clinton administration officials and from Mr. Tenet, his own intelligence chief.</p>
<P>
In May 2001,  Ms. Rice  recalled in a private meeting with the commission,  Mr. Bush grew impatient with repeated warnings in his daily briefings. At one point, Ms. Rice said, the president expressed impatience with "swatting flies," and urged his advisers to take more aggressive steps against Al Qaeda. But there is no indication that his complaints had any impact.</p>
<P>
Instead, the evidence suggests that Mr. Bush allowed the terrorism issue to drift down the list of White House priorities from the relatively high importance given it by President Bill Clinton's national security aides. For the most part, Mr. Bush advisers told the commission that they  continued the operational activities of their predecessors.</p>
<P>
On Aug. 6, 2001, Mr. Bush, was told in a briefing held at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.,  that Mr.  bin Laden's followers were believed to be capable of hijacking commercial jets in the United States. It was a scrap of information, based on a single 1999 British intelligence report and not enough to be considered credible.</p>
<P>
The briefing was disclosed by Ms. Rice in May 2002 in an apparent effort to show that Mr. Bush was eager for information about terrorism and wanted to know more about the possibility of a Qaeda attack in the United States. But this  week, Richard Ben-Veniste, a commission member, said that the C.I.A. had advised the panel that the agency's official  who met with Mr. Bush did not recall him  requesting  the information and that the agency itself had come up with the idea of briefing the president on terrorist activities involving aircraft.
