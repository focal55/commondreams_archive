The protesters who climbed Big Ben to demonstrate against the war in Iraq will not be prosecuted, police confirmed today.<p>
Greenpeace supporters Harry Westaway and brother Simon scaled the London landmark on the anniversary of the invasion on March 20 and unfurled banners which stated “time for the truth”.<p>

The brothers, both from Lewes, East Sussex, were arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage, and bailed to return to a London police station today.<p>
A spokesman for New Scotland Yard said this afternoon that no further action was being taken against the men.<p>
He declined to comment further.<p>
Greenpeace welcomed the move. A spokeswoman said: “We are very happy that no charges are being brought against Harry and Simon for their peaceful anti-war protest at Big Ben.<p>
“They climbed Big Ben to express their strongly-held belief that the war against Iraq was wrong and illegal.”<p>
The brothers’ seven-hour protest sparked a review of policing, and at the time they described overcoming Parliament’s defenses as “easy”.
<p>
They cleared a wall and security fence before climbing the 315ft tower.<p>
Today Harry Westaway, 28, said criticism of the police response was “misplaced” and added: “We feel their reaction was responsible and proportionate.”<p>
He said: “We climbed Big Ben to urge Tony Blair to come clean about why he went to war against Iraq.<p>
“It clearly wasn’t because of WMD, as none have been found.<p>
“It clearly went against the will of the United Nations and was illegal under international law. It has only increased the threat to Britain from international terrorism.<p>
“Finally, it was clearly without the support of the UK public who came out in unprecedented numbers to urge him not to take us to war.<p>
“One year on, we urge him to come clean, admit his mistakes and commit to never undertake an illegal pre-emptive war in Britain’s name ever again.”
