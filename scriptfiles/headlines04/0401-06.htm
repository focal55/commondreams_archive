WASHINGTON  - Most Americans agree with a former  White House counterterrorism chief that President Bush was lax  on terrorism before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a poll  published on Thursday found.
<p> 
			
			However, the poll also found that a majority of Americans  still support Bush's record on security, a key issue in his  reelection effort.<p> 
			
			The poll by the Los Angeles Times found that 52 percent of  Americans agreed with charges by the former official, Richard  Clarke, that Bush "failed to take the threat of terrorism  seriously enough" before the attacks, while 40 percent  disagreed.<p> 
			
			An even larger share, 57 percent, agreed with Clarke that  Bush placed a higher priority on invading Iraq than on  combating terrorism.<p> 
			
			Clarke's charges have received immense publicity in recent  weeks -- in testimony before a commission investigating the  Sept. 11 attacks, in media coverage of a new book by Clarke,  and in the White House's ferocious counterattack against his  credibility.<p> 
			
			The Los Angeles Times survey of 1,616 Americans, taken  March 27-30, also found that 56 percent approved of Bush's  handling of the war on terrorism, and 59 percent believed he  had made the country more secure -- a figure little changed  since November.<p> 
			
			Those findings are significant for an election year in  which Bush, who has called himself a "war president," has made  his leadership of the fight against global terrorism a major  campaign theme.<p> 
			
			LONG TERM PROBLEM<p> 
			
			"While the new questions about Bush's initial response to  the terrorist threat could pose a long-term problem for him,  the poll suggests the controversy (over Clarke's charges) has  not significantly changed the dynamics propelling the country  toward another close presidential race," the newspaper said in  its report on the poll.<p> 
			
			A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released earlier this week also  found majority support for Bush's handling of the terrorism  issue, but said the 58 percent support represented the lowest  level since measurement began after the Sept. 11 attacks.<p> 
			
			A survey released on Wednesday by the nonpartisan Council  for Excellence in Government found that fewer than half of  Americans -- 47 percent -- believed the United States was safer  now than before the Sept. 11 attacks, although the share was  greater than the 38 percent minority one year after the  attacks.<p> 
			
			The Los Angeles Times poll also found some support for the  White House's criticisms of Clarke, with 58 percent saying his  book was politically motivated. But only 28 percent agreed with  charges by some Republicans that his criticisms were motivated  by a failure to win a promotion from Bush.<p> 
			
			In the presidential campaign pitting Bush against  Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the poll showed  Kerry leading Bush by 49 percent to 46 percent among voters, a  difference within the poll's 3-point margin of error.<p> 
			
			Bush's overall job approval rating was 51 percent, down  slightly from November and just above the 50 percent level that  heralds a danger zone for candidates seeking reelection.<p> 
			
			The newspaper said the share of Americans who cited  security issues as their top concern was the same as those who  picked economic issues.
