<p>SANTIAGO (Tierramérica)  - Ten percent renewable sources of energy, established
as a worldwide goal for 2010, is already a reality in Latin America, but
that has been achieved mostly through big hydroelectric dams, which
environmentalists argue are not sustainable.
</b> <p>
                  
When the region assumed that goal in 2002, it already used nearly 26 percent
renewable sources, but 15 percent were hydroelectric dams, according to
figures from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLAC), a regional agency of the United Nations.
<p>
Renewable does not mean sustainable, say activists and experts who want to
see fewer gigantic dams and more regulation of the use of firewood (the
source of 5.8 percent of energy used in the region in 2002), and incentives
for non-conventional sources.
<p>
They point to Costa Rica, where 50 percent of the energy matrix is supplied
by geothermal energy, sugarcane waste, biomass and other renewable sources
seen as more sustainable.
<p>
The International Conference for Renewable Energies, held in Bonn, Jun. 1-4,
drew delegates from 154 countries who assessed progress towards the goal -- 
set in 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in
Johannesburg -- of replacing fossil fuels in the global energy matrix.
<p>
The objective of 10 percent renewable energy by 2010 represents ''the
opportunity to fight poverty by using local natural resources in a
decentralized way, the possibility of overcoming dependence on fossil fuels,
which now represent significant costs for the nations of the South, and the
urgency of protecting the climate and the environment,'' Sara Larraín,
director of the non-governmental group Sustainable Chile, told Tierramérica.
<p>
Around 23 percent of Latin America's total primary energy supply (TPES)
comes from renewable sources, including hydroelectric dams, according to the
ECLAC study ''Energy sustainability in Latin America and the Caribbean: the
share of renewable sources'', published in October 2003.
<p>
The report says that Argentina, highly dependent on natural gas, is the only
country in the region with under 10 percent renewable energy sources, but
there are four others in the critical zone of 10 to 20 percent: Mexico,
Ecuador, Venezuela and Chile.
<p>
On the other extreme are Costa Rica, with 99.2 percent renewable energy,
followed by Paraguay, Honduras, Haiti and El Salvador, with more than 80
percent.
<p>
But in that group, all is not positive. Paraguay is almost totally dependent
on hydroelectric energy, while Honduras, Haiti and El Salvador, like its
Central American neighbors Nicaragua and Guatemala, rely heavily on
''dendroenergy'': firewood.
<p>
Critics argue that big hydroelectric dams hurt the ecosystems around them
and alter the living conditions of local communities, which are generally
indigenous groups.
<p>
Firewood is a renewable resource, but only as long as it is accompanied by
adequate reforestation.
<p>
Manlio Coviello and Hugo Altomonte, authors of the ECLAC study, say reliance
on firewood is ''disturbing and to a certain extent negative, because of the
heavy impact it has on forestry resources and the consequent increase in
carbon dioxide emissions from burning wood.''
<p>
Carbon dioxide emissions are the main cause of what is known as the
greenhouse effect.
<p>
The most accessible renewable source currently seems to be geothermal
energy, given the high costs still associated with widespread use of solar,
wind or wave power, though biomass (made from biological waste) is also
gaining ground, as are small hydroelectric dams, which are also seen as more
sustainable.
<p>
''Brazil has the most sustainable and cleanest energy matrix in the world,''
with 90 percent of its TPES based on renewable sources, including
hydroelectric power, Emilio La Rovere, professor of energy planning at the
University of Rio de Janeiro, told Tierramérica.
<p>
In the wake of the 1970s energy crisis, Brazil developed sugarcane alcohol
as a gasoline substitute.
<p>
In recent years, automotive companies have developed engines that use
gasoline or alcohol, or the two mixed, and are working on ''trivalent''
models that could also run on natural gas. Today in Brazil there are 700,000
to 800,000 natural gas-run vehicles, a figure that only Argentina surpasses.
<p>
Another specific case that environmentalists point to is Cuba. The Caribbean
island's energy matrix ''is sustainable because it is changeable and is
tending towards achieving sustainable energy development,'' Luis Bérriz,
president of the non-governmental group Cubasolar, told Tierramérica.
<p>
Cuba relied heavily on Soviet petroleum until the early 1990s. The collapse
of the Soviet Union led to an interruption in supplies and pushed Cuba into
crisis. Since then, Havana has been developing its own hydrocarbon
resources, energy conservation plans, and pursuing research of renewable
energy sources.
<p>
But the ECLAC report finds that Cuba still depends on petroleum, which
represents 56.1 percent of its TPES, while renewable sources comprise 37.9
percent, and are mostly sugarcane by-products (34.5 percent), which tend to
use ''combustion processes that are not very efficient.''
