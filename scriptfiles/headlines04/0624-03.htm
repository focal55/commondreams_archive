<!--/endimage/-->NEW YORK - Director Michael Moore’s controversial documentary “Fahrenheit 9/11” turned on the box office heat in its first day in theaters breaking single-day records at the two New York City theaters where it played.
<p>The movie, which aims a critical eye at President Bush and his prosecution of the war in Iraq, sold $49,000 worth of tickets at the Loew’s Village 7 theater, beating the venue’s single-day record of $43,435 held by 1997’s "Men in Black,” according to distributors Lions Gate Films and IFC Films.

<p>At the Lincoln Plaza theater, “Fahrenheit 9/11” took in more than $30,000 to top the $24,013 set by “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” in 2000.
<p>A spokesman for Lions Gate Films said the company debuted the movie in the two theaters to help build good word-of-mouth — friend telling friend — publicity ahead of the wide debut  Friday when it plays in 868 theaters in all 50 states.

<p>The film has caused a storm of controversy because director Moore, whose past work includes Oscar-winning documentary "Bowling for Columbine,” makes a case that the Bush administration was determined to invade Iraq following the Sept. 11 attacks.

<p>The movie links Bush family members and business associates with wealthy Saudi Arabian families, including that of Osama bin Laden, and Moore clearly wants to see the president fail to win reelection in this fall’s presidential campaign.

<p>Groups have organized support for and against the movie, and audiences appear to be keen to see it.

<p>Online ticket service <a href="http://www.Fandango.com" target="_new">Fandango.com</a> Wednesday reported that “Fahrenheit 9/11” was making up 48 percent of advance ticket sales for the weekend ahead, compared to 11 percent for current box office champ “Dodgeball” and 9 percent for ”Spider-Man 2,” which opens June 30.
