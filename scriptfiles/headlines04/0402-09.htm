JERUSALEM  - Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  on Friday threatened his long-time foe Yasser Arafat with  assassination, calling the Palestinian president a poor  insurance risk.
<p> 
			
			The United States said it opposed the assassination of the  veteran Palestinian leader.<p> 
			
			The Israeli army killed three Palestinians in separate  incidents in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while in Jerusalem's  Old City, police stormed the square outside al-Aqsa Mosque, one  of Islam's holiest sites.<p> 
			
			Israeli police said officers used rubber bullets and stun  grenades to disperse Palestinian stone-throwers and arrested 14  after Friday Muslim prayers.<p> 
			
			Adnan Husseini, director of the Islamic Waqf, which  oversees the compound, said about 60 people were wounded,  including three journalists. He said police acted without  provocation and called the Israeli action a "flagrant violation  of freedom of worship."<p> 
			
			Sharon made his most explicit threat yet against Arafat in  newspaper interviews 10 days after Israel assassinated Hamas  leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in a helicopter strike in Gaza. He  also directed the warning at Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, leader of  Lebanon's Hizbollah guerrilla group.<p> 
			
			"I wouldn't suggest either one of them should feel secure.  I wouldn't propose that any insurance company give them  coverage," Sharon told Israel's Haaretz daily.<p> 
			
			"Anyone who kills a Jew or harms an Israeli citizen, or  sends someone to kill Jews, is a marked man. Period."<p> 
			
			Arafat, holed up in his battered headquarters in the West  Bank city of Ramallah, denies involvement in violence.<p> 
			
			Responding to Sharon's threats, Deputy Secretary of State  Richard Armitage told reporters in Washington: "Our position on  such questions -- the exile or assassination of Yasser Arafat  -- is very well known. We are opposed and we have made that  very clear to the government of Israel."<p> 
			
			An Israeli-Arab legislator who visited Arafat said the  Palestinian leader dismissed the threat saying: "Sharon has  tried to kill me 13 times and failed. I'm not an easy mark."<p> 
			
			Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said of Sharon's  remarks that the alternative to Arafat would be "chaos,  extremism and anarchy" in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip.<p> 
			
			Israel's government declared in September that Arafat  should be "removed." But Arafat, 74, regarded by Palestinians  as a symbol of their struggle for statehood, has scoffed at  such threats saying he would welcome "martyrdom."<p> 
			
			Sharon, moreover, has acknowledged he has promised the  United States not to harm Arafat.<p> 
			
			SHARON UNDER PRESSURE OVER GAZA PULLOUT PLAN<p> 
			
			Sharon is under pressure from far-right coalition partners  -- the same political allies who have long demanded that Israel  kill Arafat -- over his plan to remove soldiers and settlers  from most of Gaza and some of the West Bank.<p> 
			
			Sharon is due to hold talks with President Bush in  Washington on April 14 to finalize details of the plan.<p> 
			
			A diplomatic source said American envoys made progress  toward hammering out letters of understanding that would be  exchanged during the White House meeting.<p> 
			
			Sharon wants U.S. endorsement of Israel's annexation of  large West Bank settlement blocs and a rejection of a  Palestinian claim of a right of return of refugees displaced  when Israel was founded in 1948.<p> 
			
			The source said U.S. officials were looking for vague  wording that would meet Sharon's need to mollify right-wingers  opposed to the pullout plan but which would not prejudge  negotiations for a final peace agreement.<p> 
			
			The Maariv daily quoted Sharon as saying all settlements in  Gaza and four in the West Bank would be evacuated. He said he  hoped the Gaza pullout, in what he called the absence of a  Palestinian peace partner, would be under way by next Spring.<p> 
			
			But his proposal could be rendered moot should he lose a  binding referendum he plans to hold on the issue in his Likud  party or if Israel's attorney general accepts prosecutors'  recommendations to indict him in a bribery case.<p> 
			
			In West Bank violence, Israeli troops killed a Palestinian  near the town of Bethlehem during a clash with stone-throwing  youths, witnesses said. Military sources said a Palestinian  threw a petrol bomb at soldiers, who returned fire and shot  him.<p> 
			
			In the southern Gaza Strip, Israeli forces killed a  Palestinian during a raid to uncover weapons-smuggling tunnels  in Rafah refugee camp near the Egyptian border, witnesses said.<p> 
			
			In a separate incident in the central Gaza Strip, soldiers  shot dead a Palestinian, witnesses said. Israeli military  sources said the man was a gunman. Palestinians security  sources said the man as a farmer who was working in his field.
