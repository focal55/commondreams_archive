A Foreign Office memo, leaked to the Sunday Times, appears to show widespread concern that US tactics are making the task of British troops in the south of Iraq more dangerous. <P>With Michael Howard, the Tory leader, demanding that the prime minister make his differences with Washington more public, ministers deny the leak is a deliberate one to demonstrate independent thinking. But the timing and tone are far from unhelpful.  <P>"Heavy handed US military tactics in Falluja and Najaf some weeks ago have fueled both Sunni and Shi'ite opposition to the coalition, and lost us much public support inside Iraq. It has spread fighting to MND(SE)'s area &#91;southern Iraq&#93;", the memo states.  
<P>American forces have "learnt   lessons from this and are generally proceeding more cautiously". Drawn up earlier this month, the memo also states: "We should not underestimate the present difficulties:  <P><B>&#183;</B> "Iraqization of security forces will not be complete by transition on June 30.  
<P><B>&#183;</B> "There are signs of better organization by insurgents and a reservoir of popular support, at least among Sunnis."  
<P>The memo says control by coalition forces is "precarious" in the areas around Kut, and that the Italians seemed to have lost control of Nassiriya earlier this month.  <P>The government is still haggling with the US over the terms under which at least 3,000 British troops will soon be deployed in Iraqi troublespots without being tainted by what the leaked Whitehall memo calls "heavy-handed" American military tactics.  <P>Senior officials stress there is no doubt that further British troops will be sent to Iraq before sovereignty is handed over to an interim Iraqi government in Baghdad on June 30. But military chiefs have urged Mr Blair to send extra forces only on British terms, not those of the US, whose tactics they privately condemn as brutal and counter-productive, the Guardian has learned.  <P>The memo continues: "Security difficulties are slowing reconstruction and affecting Iraqi confidence in the coalition. While power supplies this summer will be much better than last year, &#91;Coalition Provisional Authority&#93; targets for summer electricity production are unlikely to be met."  <P>The memo adds: "We need a more flexible approach towards cooperation with existing militias.  <P>"This seems to have worked on local initiative in Falluja and the US are now considering something similar in Kerbala. But ... this has risks as well as opportunities and needs to be considered carefully on a case-by-case basis.  <P>"More generally, we shall want to minimize the profile of coalition forces after July 1, and get the Iraqis out in front ... particularly in patrolling and policing.  
<P>"We need to double our efforts to ensure a sensible and sensitive US approach to military operations. The message seems to be accepted at the highest levels, but not always implemented lower down the command chain."  <P>After the handover to an interim Iraqi government an Iraqi-led national security council will be set up with officials from the US, Britain and other countries with forces still in Iraq, the memo says: "We must ensure successful negotiation of a &#91;new UN security council resolution&#93; ideally before the D-Day celebrations on June 6 (which will serve as some leverage on the French). The prospects for this look reasonably positive."  
<div id="OvertureDivHolder"><div id="OvertureDiv"></div></div><P>The memo says the MoD is considering options, either to deploy a divisional headquarters with a battlegroup or ground forces to run Najaf and Qudissiya provinces: "If we go down either route we should ensure that we use it to maximize our influence over American military decisions, and that we can prevent US action, either at the strategic or operational levels, which would jeopardize our objectives."
