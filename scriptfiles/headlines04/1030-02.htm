<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq  - Eight U.S. marines were killed  Saturday in the bloodiest attack on American forces in Iraq in  almost seven months as troops prepared for a major assault to  capture the rebel towns of Ramadi and Falluja.<p> 
			
			Violence flared across Iraq ahead of the offensive,  expected any day, and U.S. planes and artillery pounded Falluja  in the country's central Sunni Muslim heartland.<p>

At least seven people were killed by a suspected car bomb  outside the Al Arabiya television office in Baghdad, the  station reported, and seven Iraqis died in clashes with U.S.  troops in an area dubbed the triangle of death southwest of the  capital.<p> 
			
			The U.S. military said the marines were killed in the  restive western province of Anbar, which includes Falluja and  Ramadi, but gave no details. Nine marines were also wounded.<p> 
			
			Witnesses said earlier they had seen three U.S. vehicles  burning on a road east of Falluja, in the same province. It was  not clear if that was where the marine casualties occurred.<p> 
			
			The deaths bring to 858 the number of U.S. troops killed in  combat. The total number of U.S. troop deaths, including  accidents and other causes, is now almost 1,120.<p> 
			
			U.S. marine commanders said Friday they were preparing for  a major assault on Falluja and Ramadi.<p> 
			
			The aim is to crush guerrillas and root out Arab militants  led by declared al Qaeda ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi to enable  Iraq's interim government to hold national elections in  January.<p> 
			
			At least a dozen air strikes hit southeastern Falluja,  witnesses said. U.S. marine spokesman Lieutenant Lyle Gilbert  said marines on the edge of Falluja had come under mortar fire  from insurgents and called in artillery support.<p> 
			
			Gilbert called the action the "most consistent and drawn  out artillery barrage in recent days," but did not mark the  beginning of the long-anticipated U.S. offensive.<p> 
			
			VOLATILE MIX<p> 
			
			Marine commanders say they face a volatile mix of up to  2,000 Iraqi and foreign fighters entrenched in the city. Some  are thought to be former army officers loyal to Saddam Hussein,  others Islamist militants led by Zarqawi, a Jordanian.<p> 
			
			Zarqawi, America's top enemy in Iraq, has claimed  responsibility for some of the bloodiest violence in the  country and the beheadings of foreign hostages.<p> 
			
			In Baghdad, Al Arabiya said seven people were killed and 16  wounded in the blast outside its office, in an up-market  neighborhood. Officials could not immediately confirm the toll.<p> 
			
			Television footage showed doctors stitching the bloodied  face of one woman as she writhed in agony. Other victims, their  clothes bloody and torn, were carried into the crowded hospital  amid chaotic scenes.<p> 
			
			Najwa Qassem, senior Arabiya correspondent in Baghdad, said  the blast had started a fire and damaged the building. She said  a suspected car bomb had exploded in the parking lot but could  not be sure the television station was the intended target.<p> 
			
			The satellite channel is majority Saudi-owned. It has often  been attacked on Web sites used by Islamist militant groups for  its perceived pro-Western stance in the Arab world.<p> 
			
			A few weeks ago, an Internet statement purporting to be  from Zarqawi's group had threatened attacks against Al Arabiya.<p> 
			
			Seven Iraqis were killed and 14 wounded in clashes between  gunmen and U.S. troops southwest of Baghdad, when gunmen  attacked U.S. soldiers raiding buildings.<p> 
			
			Reuters Television footage showed two civilian cars and a  truck riddled with bullets, their seats stained with blood.<p> 
			
			Occupants said they had been caught in a crossfire. It was  unclear how many of the casualties were gunmen and how many  were civilians. Neither the U.S. nor the British military,  which deployed in the area this week, had information on the  incident.<p> 
			
			The interim government and its U.S. backers are battling to  restore peace to the country so Iraqis can elect a national  assembly in January to draft a new constitution.<p> 
			
			But some insurgent groups fighting to drive out U.S.-led  forces are opposed to the polls. The election commission has  received death threats signed by militants using the old name  of Zarqawi's group.<p> 
			
			Typewritten letters in the name of the Tawhid wal Jihad  (One God and Holy War) Assassinations Squad warned members of  the commission would be killed, along with their families, if  they stayed at their posts, spokesman Farid Ayar said.<p> 
			
			Militants have also kidnapped two more foreigners, a Somali  truck driver and a Sudanese translator.<p> 
			
			Confusion surrounds the fate of Japanese backpacker Shosei  Koda, abducted while traveling by bus on holiday, after medical  checks found a beheaded body discovered Friday was not his.<p> 
			
			At least 25 foreigners from a dozen countries, including  two women, are thought to be in the hands of kidnappers trying  to drive U.S.-led forces and foreign workers from Iraq. Scores  of foreigners have been abducted since April. Many have been  freed but more than 35 have been killed, several of them  beheaded.<p>
