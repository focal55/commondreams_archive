<p>WASHINGTON  - Two Republican congressional
staffers improperly accessed about 4,700 computer files of
their Democratic colleagues, a source familiar with an
investigation of the matter said on Thursday.
<p>
 Members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee  privately
received a written report on the probe of their own panel's
computer system, and put off until at least next week what, if
any action to take, said the source, who asked not to be
identified.
<p>
 Options included -- if consensus can be reached on the
often sharply divided panel -- seeking criminal prosecutions
against the two Republican staffers who have since resigned.
<p>
 The computer files were improperly accessed between 2001
and 2003, the source said, and dealt largely with President
Bush's embattled judicial nominees.
<p>
 Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, earlier
on Thursday blamed the matter on "two misguided former Senate
staff members."
<p>
 Hatch also said Democrats were not the only victims,
disclosing that the investigation found more than 100 of his
documents were also improperly accessed.
<p>
 Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, called it unprecedented "partisan spying."
<p>
 Hatch and Leahy made the comments shortly before copies of
the probe were given to committee members to privately review.
<p>
 Leahy and Hatch planned to release copies of the
investigation by the U.S. Senate's Sergeant at Arms Office at a
news conference later.
<p>
 Democrats contend the file breach constituted a theft.
Republicans agreed to the investigation but said they wanted
more information before reaching conclusions.
<p>
 "Regardless whether any criminal law was broken, the
improper accessing was wrong and unjustified and will go down
as a sad chapter in the Senate and this committee," Hatch said.
<p>
 Congressional law enforcement in November began looking
into what Democrats called the computer theft of 14 staff memos
critical of Bush's judicial nominees.
<p>
 The memos, which described Democrats conferring with
liberal groups opposed to Bush's most conservative nominees,
were first quoted in The Wall Street Journal, and then in other
publications.
<p>
 Hatch initially suggested the memos were turned over to the
news media by a "conscience-stricken" Democratic staffer. But
he later denounced the action when he learned the files had
been obtained by Republican staffers.
<p>
 "I'm very upset that this happened, and I've been upset for
quite a while," Hatch said. "I hope we can work through this
and not be vindictive."
<p>
 "Let's not forget that the overwhelming majority of our
staff conducted themselves in an entirely proper and honorable
fashion while working with a less than perfect computer system
in a too often too contentious environment," he added.
<p>
 Hatch did not identify the two former Republican staffers
accused of obtaining files without authorization.
<p>
 Manuel Miranda, who formerly worked for Hatch, resigned
last month as an aide to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a
Tennessee Republican, after his name surfaced in the probe.
<p>
In his resignation statement, Miranda said he had not seen
anything ethically or legally wrong with reading some
Democratic documents, and that a young aide had downloaded
"perhaps thousands" of documents but not read them all.
<p>
Miranda said it was not his fault Republicans could get the
memos through the computer system.ed for June 30, the spokesman said.
