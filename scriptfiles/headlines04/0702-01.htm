<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska   - A warming climate is bringing  expensive and potentially dangerous erosion and floods to  Native Alaskan villages, representatives of those communities  told federal officials this week.
<p>Storms tear off chunks of beach once shielded by permafrost  or Arctic pack ice. Buildings are in danger of toppling into  the sea, and many have already been moved, at great expense.
<p>Airstrips are swamped and ice cellars that once stored food  in the permafrost are filling with water, residents say.
<p>"As the calming hand of the ice on the Arctic Ocean grows  more fragile, so does our coastline," Barrow Mayor Edith  Vorderstrasse told members of the U.S. Senate Appropriations  Committee during a two-day field hearing in Anchorage. "We are  at a crossroads. Is it practical to stand and fight our mother  ocean? Or do we surrender and move?"
<p>Fixing the problems by expanding seawalls or relocating  entire towns could cost hundreds of millions of dollars for  each village, according to General Accounting Office estimates  presented at the hearing.
<p>Of the 213 Native Alaskan villages, 184 face flooding and  erosion problems, with very serious problems in about 20, the  GAO says.
<p>Tough rules for securing federal aid, requiring local  matching funds and cost-benefit analyzes, leave many villages  out in the cold, local officials say.
<p>For residents of Shishmaref, a coastal village of 600 with  severe erosion problems, abandoning their ancestral homeland  with its traditional food supply "would have a devastating  impact on how we exist and who we are," said Luci Eningowuk,  chairman of the Shishmaref Erosion and Relocation Coalition.
<p>Residents have already moved 18 homes and two National  Guard buildings. Two years ago they voted to move the entire  town inland but have not yet secured the money to relocate.
<p>Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who chairs the  committee and called the hearing, said villagers' complaints  about standards for federal aid were valid.
<p>"There's no tax base. Most of them have absolutely no  industrial base at all," he said during a break in the hearing.
<p>And it is unfair to blame the Native Alaskans for living in  what are now vulnerable spots, Stevens said.
<p>He cited the Inupiat village of Point Hope, established  2,600 years ago on the northwestern Alaska coast. Flooding  problems will likely force the village of 725 people to move,  or build a costly road offering an escape route.
<p>"It's been there since before the birth of Christ. You  can't quite say the decision to locate their village, when it  was made, was right or wrong," Stevens said.
<p>Vorderstrasse, whose town of 4,400 is the northernmost  community in the United States, has no doubt that global  warming is behind the erosion, which disrupts whaling and goose  hunting.
<p>"We've had rain in January. We had a real early spring in  April," she said. "Our weather pattern is really different.  It's not consistent like it used to be."
<p>The earth's warming trend, which most scientists say is  accelerated by the trapping of pollutants in the atmosphere, is  more dramatic at polar latitudes.
<p>Scientists at the University of Alaska Fairbanks say air  temperatures in Alaska, Siberia and Canada have risen 1 degree  Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade, compared to the  global average of 0.6 degree Celsius (1.2 degrees Fahrenheit)  per century.
<p>"Whether it's natural or global climate change, our state  is having an impact greater than any other part of the United  States," Stevens said.
<p>But a colleague, Senator Conrad Burns, rejects the idea  that pollution-induced global warming is to blame for the  erosion in rural Alaska.
<p>"I haven't bought off on global warming yet," the Montana  Republican said. "I don't think it's man-made. The earth is in  constant change all the time."
<p>Still, he said, federal aid will get to the Native  villages. "Congress responds, as a rule, to disasters and  catastrophes. They just do it, because we're a compassionate  country," he said.
