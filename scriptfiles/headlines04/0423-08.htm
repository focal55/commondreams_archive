BAGHDAD  - A U.S. policy shift that may allow  former Baathists join a new Iraqi government was akin to  putting back Nazis in charge of Germany, Governing Council  member Ahmad Chalabi said on Friday.
<p> 
			
			"This policy will create major problems in the transition  to democracy, endanger any government put together by U.N.  envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and cause it to fall after June 30,"  Chalabi told Reuters.<p> 
			
			He spoke after the White House announced an overhaul of the  "de-Baathification" policy, which may let some former members  join an interim government being put together by the United  Nations ahead of a planned June 30 transfer of power.<p> 
			
			"This is like allowing Nazis into the German government  immediately after World War II," added Chalabi, who heads a  council committee specifically dedicated to keeping the upper  ranks of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party out of office.<p> 
			
			Chalabi said U.S. Governor Paul Bremer discussed with the  council on Thursday how to reinstate junior public workers,  such as teachers, who were nominally Baath members, but did not  mention Baathists taking part in a new government.<p> 
			
			Bremer was due to explain changes to the policy in a  televised speech to Iraqis later on Friday.<p> 
			
			The Baath Party, founded by French-educated Syrian  intellectuals in the 1940s, ruled Iraq from 1968 until Saddam  was toppled last year by a U.S.-led invasion.<p> 
			
			"CHAUVINIST AND RACIST"<p> 
			
			The former Iraqi opposition, violently crushed by the  Baath, supports helping junior party members return to work if  they did not commit crimes, but is aghast at the prospect of  Baathists returning to assume senior government positions.<p> 
			
			"We refuse this U.S. direction. Like the Nazis, the Baath  was a chauvinist and racist organization," said Adnan  al-Assadi, an official of the Dawa Party which is represented  on the council.<p> 
			
			"It will help security deteriorate further, disappoint  Iraqis who have trusted the coalition to manage the political  process and lead to civil war," he added.<p> 
			
			Saddam all but wiped out the Dawa, ordering the execution  of its leader Mohammad Baqer al-Sadr in 1980 along with his  sister.<p> 
			
			The party split and has been trying to recover since Sadr,  one of the Shi'ite Islam's foremost thinkers, was killed.<p> 
			
			A Sunni Governing Council member also expressed dismay at  the White House announcement, although the policy could bring  more Sunnis to positions of power.<p> 
			
			Naseer al-Chaderji said there were former Baathists who had  joined the party without believing in its ideology, but such  people would have to be chosen by Iraqis who best know their  record if they were to serve in the new government.<p> 
			
			The upper echelons of the Baath were mostly from the Arab  Sunni minority that ruled Iraq since its foundation in the  1920s but has been losing power and privileges under the  U.S.-led occupation.<p> 
			
			"The United States have turned Iraq into a guinea pig  without giving Iraqis a say," Chaderji said.<p>
