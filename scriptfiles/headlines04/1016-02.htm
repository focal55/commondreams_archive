<p>WASHINGTON  - The United States will lose more than 400,000 jobs this year to Mexico, China, India and other Asian nations as multinational corporations restructure operations and shift production overseas, a study showed.
<p>The number of jobs lost will be around double those three years ago, according to the study by Cornell University and the University of Massachusetts for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
<p>The study came amid heated debate ahead of the November 2 presidential elections on outsourcing of jobs to China, India and other developing economies and its adverse impacts on employment at home.
<p>White House aspirant Senator John Kerry has vowed to plug tax loopholes to discourage companies from moving their operations abroad to check unemployment, if he unseats incumbent George W. Bush.
<p>The study projected that nearly 100,000 jobs would move to China in 2004 based on extrapolating data collected between January and March this year.
<p>&quot;These data suggest that in 2004 as many as 406,000 jobs will be shifted from the US to other countries compared to 204,000 jobs in 2001,&quot; of which nearly a quarter will go to China, it said.
<p>Production shifts with consequent employment loss had spread across the US economy and now affect sophisticated manufacturing industries, services, and information technology.
<p>All regions were hit by the production shifts, but the Midwest had been especially hard hit, the commission said in a statement.
<p>The commission was set up to review the national security implications of trade and economic ties between the United States and China.
<p>The study said companies engaged in production shifts &quot;tend to be large, publicly held, highly profitable, and well established.&quot;
<p>The principal motive for production shifts to China was cost reduction rather than producing for the massive Chinese market.
<p>Jobs lost because of production shifts far exceeded that reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in its report on mass layoffs due to overseas relocation, the commission said.
<p>It added that &quot;trade adjustment assistance&quot; to workers laid-off owing to overseas job relocation was poor, covering less than one-third of the cases where production shifts occur.
<p>Among other key findings was that production shifts out of the United States, particularly to Mexico, China, India, and other Asian countries, had seen a major increase in the last three years, the study said.
<p>The pace of job shifts to China has &quot;grown considerably&quot; over the last three years, the study said.
<p>Over the same period, job shifting to India has grown at a faster pace -- albeit from a much lower base.
<p>During just the first three months of this year, there were 58 such shifts to China documented across a range of industries as compared to 25 shifts to China during a similar period in 2001.</p>
