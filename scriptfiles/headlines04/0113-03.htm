<p>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina  - A 30-minute taxi ride
past the shuttered factories and graffiti-covered McDonald's of
Buenos Aires is a virtual tour showing why more Latin Americans
hate the United States these days.
<p>
 The first stop is the Brukman textiles plant, which was
abandoned by its owners in December 2001 after a decade of
pro-Washington, free-market policies by Argentina's government
ended with an epic economic crash.
<p>
 "Argentina did everything the United States told us to, and
we went straight to hell," said Sergio Cardenas, one of 60
workers who have since taken control of the factory and resumed
production as a co-op. "The Americans ruined us."
<p>
 A mile away sits a McDonald's restaurant that was set on
fire two years ago when riots toppled a pro-U.S. president. Hop
back in the cab to the financial district, and pass banks
covered with metal shields to protect them from customers angry
over a systemwide deposit freeze in place since the crash.
<p>
 "Yankee gangsters! Give our money back!" blares graffiti
scrawled on the walls of a branch of U.S.-owned Citibank.
<p>
 As around the rest of Latin America, anti-U.S. sentiment is
certainly nothing new. Former Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz
could have been speaking for the whole region a century ago
when he said: "Poor Mexico! So far from God, and so close to
the United States."
<p>
At a summit of 34 American nations this week in Monterrey,
Mexico, President Bush, who entered office three years ago
proclaiming himself a friend of the region, ran into more
animosity than usual.
 <p>
 Distrust has deepened following the 1990s when many
governments aligned with Washington only to see their economies
collapse into crisis at the end of the decade.
 <p>
 WAR ON IRAQ UNPOPULAR
 <p>
 A 17-country survey on Latin American attitudes by
Latinobarometro, a Chilean polling firm, found that 53 percent
of Latin Americans held a favorable view of the United States,
against 67 percent in 2000.
 <p>
 Even stalwart supporters of America like Mexico and Chile
were alienated by the war on Iraq, which many Latin Americans
likened to historic interference in their home turf via troop
invasions and U.S.-sponsored coups.
 <p>
 "The United States has never cared about Latin America and
it's worse when it has problems and phobias over terrorism,"
said Peruvian bank employee Alfredo Romero, 29, as he shopped
in downtown Lima.
 <p>
 A Zogby poll among Latin American opinion formers showed
that Bush, who speaks some Spanish, has a worse image around
the region than Cuban President Fidel Castro. Brazilian 
communist politicians hand out posters with a Hitler-style
mustache painted on Bush's face.
 <p>
 "We are not anti-U.S., we're anti-George W. Bush," said
Felipe Correa, a 25-year-old student in Brazil.
 <p>
 Back in Buenos Aires, the imaginary tour ends with a stop
at the U.S. Embassy, where at least a small group of
demonstrators is usually present during the day. But some
wonder if the United States is unfairly used as a scapegoat.
 <p>
 "I don't agree with anything they do," said Elena Ruiz, 56,
gesturing at the high-security, concrete walls of the embassy.
"But I also think that what happens in Argentina is Argentina's
fault, not the Yankees."</p>
