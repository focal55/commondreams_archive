<p>WASHINGTON - Media and telecommunications mergers
would likely face greater scrutiny by the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission  if Sen. John Kerry wins next week's
presidential election, industry analysts and lobbyists say.

If President Bush  is reelected, these experts expect the
FCC to continue freeing companies from regulation and pushing
competition between cable, wireless, telephone and satellite
systems, rather than within each mode.
<p>

 No matter who wins, the next president is seen getting a
chance to reshape the five-member FCC due to the expected
departure of chairman Michael Powell, but it's unclear who Bush
or Kerry would select to replace him.
<p>

 The FCC, while a small government agency, has broad powers
to decide who owns the nation's media landscape, set the rules
for competition and enforce limits on the broadcast of indecent
material.
<p>

 "On the question of media ownership, a Kerry FCC and
(Justice Department) is likely to be tougher on media
concentration," said Blair Levin, a former FCC official during
the Clinton administration.
<p>

 The FCC last year relaxed ownership limits allowing
companies to own more radio and television stations but a court
put those rules on hold. The agency has until Dec. 2 to appeal
that decision to the Supreme Court.
<p>

 If Kerry is elected, most expect the interim chairman to be
Democrat Commissioner Michael Copps, who has railed against
media consolidation, indecency, and how deregulating the
telephone industry has hurt competition.
<p>

 Copps "has some pretty clear views that the FCC's current
deregulatory path is the wrong path," said Paul Glenchur, an
analyst at Schwab SoundView. "That's not great news for the
Bells," referring to the major local telephone carriers.
<p>


 Cable and telephone companies have been lobbying the FCC to
set the rules for deploying high-speed Internet service, a
product good for their profits. But the companies have been
fearful that they may have to share their new networks.
<p>

 Other names floating to lead or join the commission under
Kerry include California Public Utility Commissioner Susan
Kennedy, former FCC Commissioner Susan Ness, communications
lawyer Antoinette Cook Bush, and former Kerry aide Greg
Rothschild. One source noted it could be someone from outside
the FCC world.
<p>

 But if Powell and his two fellow Republicans decide to
leave rightaway, that could paralyze the FCC because it needs
at least three commissioners to act and the new members must be
confirmed by the Senate.
<p>

 If Bush is re-elected, most expect Powell to leave by
mid-year, potentially to head the College of William and Mary
whose president steps down in June or maybe move within the
administration. That could open the door to Commissioner Kevin
Martin or Kathleen Abernathy.
<p>

 Other Republican names include telecommunications
consultant Janice Obuchowski, Texas Public Utility Commissioner
Rebecca Klein if she loses her congressional race, and Michael
Gallagher, the head of the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration  at the Commerce Department.
<p>


 Regardless of who joins the FCC under a second Bush term,
most industry watchers expect the agency to continue its
hands-off approach, especially for new technologies like
telephone services via the Internet.
<p>

 "If Bush wins, I see that continuing," said independent
telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan. "If Kerry wins all bets
are off."
