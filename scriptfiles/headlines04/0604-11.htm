GENEVA  - The top U.N. human rights official said  Friday U.S.-led occupation forces had mistreated many ordinary  Iraqis and called for appointment of an international ombudsman  to monitor their behavior.
<p> 

			

			Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights Bertrand  Ramcharand also suggested in a new report that U.S. soldiers  accused of gross abuses at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison could be  guilty of war crimes.<p> 

			

			There had been "serious violations of human rights" under  the Coalition Provisional Authority, including jailing of large  numbers of people "without anyone knowing how many, for what  reasons ... and how they were being treated," he said.<p> 

			

			His report, for the U.N. Human Rights Commission, cited  Iraqis interviewed by a team from his Geneva office as speaking  of "arbitrary arrests and detention as an ongoing phenomenon"  since U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq in March 2003.<p> 

			

			In a clear reference to the Abu Ghraib incidents, Ramcharan  said "willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment" of  detainees was a grave breach of international law. Several U.S.  soldiers have been detained over the incident.<p> 

			

			Such acts, he added, "might be designated as war crimes by  a competent tribunal."<p> 

			

			The report, on which the U.S. and British authorities were  allowed to comment prior to its release, accepted that the  removal of the former regime of Saddam Hussein "must be counted  a major contribution to human rights in Iraq."<p> 

			

			Saddam's government "was a brutal, murderous, torturing  gang that preyed on its own people ... and committed shocking,  systemic and criminal violations of human rights," the 45-page  report said.
<p> 

			

			"Everyone accepts the good intentions of the Coalition  governments as regards the behavior of their forces in Iraq,"  it declared, adding that Iraq could now "well be launched on  the road to democracy, the rule of law and governance that is  respectful of human rights."
