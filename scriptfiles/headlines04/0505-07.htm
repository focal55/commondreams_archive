Hamden, CT, May. 5 (UPI) -- A national poll released Wednesday finds President Bush has reached his lowest job approval rating ever.
<p> 
Forty-six percent of respondents approved of the president's job performance, vs. 47 percent who disapproved, according to a survey by Quinnipiac University. 
<p> 
The U.S. war in Iraq also received its lowest rating to date. Forty-eight percent of those polled said the United States was right to go to war in Iraq, while 45 percent said it was the wrong choice. This is a 6-point drop from findings in Quinnipiac's March 24 survey, when 54 percent approved vs. 39 who disapproved. 
<p> 
The poll also found, however, that Bush continues to lead his likely contender in the November presidential election, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. Bush received 43 percent of respondents' votes vs. 40 percent for Kerry, while independent candidate Ralph Nader got 6 percent.
<p> 
The findings were based on a survey conducted April 26 to May 3 of 2,016 registered U.S. voters. The poll has an error margin of plus or minus 2.2 percent.
