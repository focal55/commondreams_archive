<p>GENEVA  - The United States, where two-thirds of  adults are overweight, succeeded Tuesday in stalling a global  plan to fight an obesity epidemic.
<p> 
			
							The World Health Organization executive had hoped to  approve the plan to promote healthy food and lifestyles, drawn  up with the help of member states, nutritional experts and the  food industry, at the end of a debate Tuesday.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->But the United States, backed up by its powerful food  industry, has questioned findings on which the U.N. agency's  plan is based and called for more study.<p> 
			
							The draft Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and  Health warns that poor diets and lack of exercise are the  leading causes of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and  certain cancers. These account for nearly 60 percent of 56.5  million deaths a year deemed preventable.<p> 
			
							It recommends a lower intake of sugar, sodium and  artery-clogging trans-fatty acids and suggests governments set  taxation and subsidy policies to promote healthy eating habits.<p> 
			
							The WHO delayed deciding whether to approve the plan until  the end of February to allow for changes to the text.<p> 
			
							Diplomats said U.S. opposition reflected pressure by its  domestic food lobby, especially the sugar industry.<p> 
			
							William Steiger, head of the U.S. delegation, called the  plan a "good first step," but said it put too much of the  burden for diet reform on states and not enough on individuals.<p> 
			
							"Government-imposed solutions are not always appropriate,"  he said. "People need to be empowered to take responsibility  for their health."<p> 
			
							The United States has disputed experts' assertions that  heavy marketing of high-calorie foods and advertising junk food  on children's television contributes to obesity.<p> 
			
							Worldwide, 1.1 billion adults and 22 million children under  age five are obese, according to the World Heart Federation.<p> 
			
							Sixty-five percent of U.S. adults are overweight, and some  38.8 million Americans, or 31 percent of the adult population,  were classified as obese, meaning their health was seriously at  risk.<p> 
			
							Obese people are more likely to suffer heart attacks,  strokes, several forms of cancer and less deadly disabilities  such as backaches.<p> 
			
							Steiger conceded that obesity is a significant U.S. health  problem, "We are eating too much and moving too little with our  sedentary lifestyle," he said.<p> 
			
							Grenada and Mauritius, two sugar-producing states, backed  the U.S. position on the 32-state board, as did Russia, South  Korea and India.<p> 
			
							Britain, backed by Canada and France, said it was urgent  for governments to educate youth worldwide about the dangers of  junk food and soft drinks.<p> 
			
							"Obesity is a global epidemic. We see it as a health time  bomb," Dr. Liam Donaldson, Britain's chief medical officer,  told the board.<p> 
			
							"What the U.S. has achieved is reopening the consultative  process. It has created a window of opportunity to influence  reshaping the strategy," Neville Rigby, policy director at the  International Obesity Task Force, told Reuters.<p> 
			
							"It is still all to play for... There will be a lot of  horse trading between now and May," he said, referring to the  next World Health Assembly, the WHO's governing body attended  by ministers, which has the final say on policy.
