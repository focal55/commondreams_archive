TOULOUSE, France  - Hundreds of activists opposed to genetically modified crops tore out rows of maize in south-western France Sunday and threatened similar future actions of "civil disobedience" to stop the cultivation of bio-engineered food. 
<p>The group of 1,500 was led by Jose Bov&eacute;, a noted French anti-globalization activist who shot to prominence after helping pull down a McDonald's outlet in 1999 to protest US trade policy and junk food. 
<p>Others taking part included a number of public officials from the Green party, among them Noel Mamere, a deputy and mayor of a suburb in Bordeaux who has made headlines of his own for presiding over France's first homosexual wedding. 
<p>They gathered in a field owned by US biotech company Pioneer Hi-Bred International and ripped the maize by the roots as police who had been ordered not to intervene stood by and watched. 
<p>"This is a legitimate action, because we reject the law serving private interests," Mamere said. 
<p>"We are ready to accept the consequences of our acts," said Bov&eacute;, who has already spent time in jail for destroying a stock of genetically modified seeds in 1998 and ruining genetically modified rice plants in 1999. 
<p>Originally sentenced to 10 months behind bars, he ended up serving only five weeks and was released a year ago. 
<p>"In the coming weeks, there will be other GM test fields that will be destroyed," Bov&eacute; said. 
<p>France has approved 48 parcels of experimental transgenic food crops in 15 regions.</p>
