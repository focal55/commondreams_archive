<p>A slim majority of Army soldiers in Iraq  --  52 percent  --  
reported that their morale was low, and three-fourths of them said they felt 
poorly led by their officers, according to a survey taken at the end of the 
summer and released this week by the Army.
<P>In addition, 7 in 10 of those surveyed characterized the morale of their 
fellow soldiers as low or very low. The problems were most pronounced among 
lower-ranking troops and those in reserve units.
<P>"Nearly 75 percent of the groups reported that their battalion-level 
command leadership was poor" and showed "a lack of concern" for their soldiers,
said an Army report accompanying the data. "Unit cohesion was also reported 
to be low."
<P>The survey was part of a study initiated by the Army last summer after a 
number of suicides provoked concern about the mental well-being of soldiers in 
Iraq. The report faulted the Army for how it handled mental health problems, 
saying some counselors felt inadequately trained and citing problems in 
distribution of antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.
<P>But perhaps the most surprising findings were the grim conclusions about 
troop morale, which indicate that Iraq is taking a toll that goes beyond 
casualty figures.
<P>The Pentagon has been intensely worried that more frequent and longer 
combat tours will prompt more soldiers to get out of the Army rather than re-
enlist, especially if it means a second stint in Iraq or Afghanistan. Army 
insiders say it's likely that brigades from three divisions that served in 
Iraq over the past year  --  the 101st Airborne, the 3rd Infantry and the 4th 
Infantry  --  are likely to be sent back in 2005.
<P>Col. Virgil Patterson, who oversaw the Army survey, said he was "somewhat 
surprised" by the findings on troop morale. He noted that when the survey was 
taken, soldiers were still feeling the effects of a brutally hot Iraqi summer, 
and that since then troops have had better living conditions and are better 
able to communicate with their families.
<P>"It was a pretty miserable set of circumstances at the time," he said. 
"We speculate that all of those contributed to the factor of low morale."
<P>Patterson said he could not place the numbers in historical context 
because similar surveys haven't been conducted before. "This is the first time 
we've ever gone into an active combat theater and asked soldiers how they are 
doing, so we have no comparative data," he said.
<P>The study, conducted from late August through early October 2003, 
surveyed 756 Army soldiers in Iraq and Kuwait, focusing on units that had 
engaged in combat.
<P>Reaction to the Army's survey was mixed among several experts.
<P>Retired Army Col. Robert Killebrew, a Vietnam War veteran, said, "It's 
not particularly surprising, especially given the frustrating nature of the 
combat they're facing now, with patrols and bombs going off."
<P>But a senior Army commander who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
expressed alarm.
<P>"I'd be extremely worried by these numbers," said the officer, who 
specializes in morale issues. Having more than half the soldiers surveyed say 
they are unhappy should "set off alarm bells," the officer said.
<P>Jonathan Shay, a Veterans Affairs psychiatrist, called it "a painful 
report to read." Shay, who wrote two books on cohesion and leadership problems 
in the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, said the report shows morale and 
cohesion were "seriously low" among troops in Iraq.
<P>The report faulted the Army's handling of mental health issues for troops 
and called for appointment of a "czar" to coordinate such services in Iraq and 
Kuwait. Patterson said a medical specialist would fill that new position next 
month.
<P>In its findings on suicide, the report confirmed data previously released 
by the Army that the rate among soldiers in Iraq in 2003 was higher than for 
the Army generally, but lower than that of U.S. men of a similar age range.
