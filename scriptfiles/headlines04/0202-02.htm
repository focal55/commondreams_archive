<p>WASHINGTON - Facing a record &#36;521 billion
deficit, President Bush  proposed a &#36;2.4 trillion election-year
budget on Monday that will cut dozens of domestic programs and
set deficit-reduction goals that even fellow Republicans are
skeptical he can meet.

<!--/endimage/-->Bush has overseen a dramatic worsening of the budget
picture after inheriting a record surplus. He hopes to improve
his fiscal image before the November election by promising to
reduce the deficit by a third next year and in half by 2007.
<p>
 The White House still expects the shortfall to total &#36;1.35
trillion through 2009, and for government debt to rise from
&#36;8.1 trillion to &#36;10.5 trillion.
<p>
 "The government must exercise fiscal responsibility by
limiting spending growth, focusing on the results of government
programs, and cutting wasteful spending," Bush said.
<p>
 But fiscal conservatives in both parties doubt Bush can
deliver on his deficit reduction promises.
<p>
 His fiscal 2005 budget left out the tens of billions sure
to be needed next year to keep U.S. troops in Iraq  and omitted
a fix for provisions in the tax code that will put a big burden
on many middle-class households.
<p>
 Homeland security and the military will be the budget's
biggest winners with rises of nearly 10 percent and 7 percent
respectively.
<p>
 Defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp.
, Boeing Co. , Northrop Grumman Corp. ,
Raytheon Co.  and General Dynamics Corp.  stand to
benefit as Bush's &#36;401.7 billion military budget increases
spending on missile defense and on modernizing the Army.
<p>
 Hardest hit were the departments of Agriculture and
Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Small
Business Administration, and the Corps of Engineers, with cuts
ranging from 1 percent for the Commerce Department to as much
as 49 percent for the General Services Administration.
<p>
 To placate conservatives threatening a revolt, growth of
discretionary spending -- outside of homeland security and
defense -- would be capped at 0.5 percent. Because that is well
below the inflation rate, it amounts to a cut in domestic
programs and the lowest growth since 1993.
<p>
 In a tacit acknowledgment that deficits are here to stay,
Bush set the goal of bringing this year's record &#36;521 billion
shortfall down to &#36;364 billion in fiscal 2005, to &#36;241 billion
in 2007 and then to &#36;237 billion in 2009. There is no talk of
surpluses in the foreseeable future.
<p>
 ELECTION-YEAR FIGHT
<p>
 Already members of both parties are bracing for a bitter
fight, and many question whether any budget deal can be
reached.
<p>
 Democrats scoffed at Bush's plan to stem the red ink while
asking Congress to make permanent his tax cuts. "It's the most
anti-family, anti-worker, anti-health care, anti-education
budget in modern times, and it doesn't deserve to pass," said
Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat.
<p>
 Fiscal conservatives accused the White House of relying on
gimmicks, like stretching the definition of homeland security
to sidestep its own spending limits.
<p>
 Keeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan could bloat the
deficit by at least &#36;40 billion in 2005 alone.
<p>
 Even a spending freeze in areas targeted by Bush would cut
the deficit by just &#36;3 billion, according to some Republicans.
<p>
 Conservatives want much deeper cuts after the White House
acknowledged its prescription drug plan would cost one-third
more than initially advertised. Spending under Bush has grown
at the fastest pace since the Johnson administration of the
mid-1960s, they complain.
<p>
"He's got to get really serious about budget control and
really defend and enforce this budget if he's going to hold
conservatives with him in the November elections," said Stephen
Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a politically powerful
conservative group.
<p>
While homeland security and military spending will rise,
more than 65 government programs will be cut.
<p>
Some tax breaks favored by Republicans will also be reined
in, including some for energy production and business
investment.
<p>
Bush will delay budget-busting reform of the alternative
minimum tax, which requires a growing number of middle-income
taxpayers to calculate their taxes in two ways and pay the
higher bill.
<p>
Instead, Bush will propose a one-year extension of the AMT
provisions. As with Iraq, he has decided to push back the day
of reckoning until after the election.
