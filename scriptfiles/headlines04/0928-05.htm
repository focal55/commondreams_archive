<p>BAGHDAD   - Two female Italian hostages seized in  Baghdad three weeks ago were freed on Tuesday and are safe,  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said.<p> 
			
			The two aid workers, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, both  aged 29, were taken at gun-point from their central Baghdad  offices on Sept. 7, in a brazen kidnapping which caused jitters  among the thousands of foreigners working in Iraq.<p>

Several foreign hostages remain in Iraq, including British  engineer Kenneth Bigley, who has been threatened with  beheading.<p> 
			
			The Tawhid wal-Jihad (Monotheism and Holy War) group of  Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, America's number one  enemy in Iraq, says it kidnapped Bigley and two Americans from  their home in Baghdad 12 days ago.<p> 
			
			The group, which has also claim responsibility for suicide  bombing against U.S. and Iraqi security forces, demanded that  female prisoners be released from jails in Iraq -- a demand  that was not met.<p> 
			
			The two Americans were subsequently beheaded and their  deaths posted on the Internet.<p> 
			
			There had been little word on the fate of the Italians  since their abduction, along with two Iraqi colleagues,  although Al-Rai al-Aam, a leading Kuwait daily, reported the  kidnappers had agreed to their release in exchange for a $1  million ransom.<p> 
			
			They were at least the sixth and seventh Italians to be  kidnapped in Iraq. Four security guards were taken in April.<p> 
			
			One of those was killed after Rome refused to give in to  demands to withdraw its troops. The others were later freed.<p> 
			
			Last month, Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni was killed by  his captors after Rome again refused to pull its troops out.<p> 
			
			While Bigley's fate remains uncertain, an Iranian diplomat  kidnapped nearly two months ago was freed on Monday.<p> 
			
			An Egyptian telecoms worker, one of six kidnapped last  week, was also freed, Cairo's embassy in Baghdad said. Efforts  were being made to have the remaining five released.<p> 
			
			The Iranian's release raised hopes for the fate of two  French journalists seized by the same group, the Islamic Army  in Iraq, on Aug. 20.<p> 
			
			U.S. BOMBARDMENT<p> 
			
			U.S. warplanes bombarded rebel-held areas, targeting  fighters loyal to Zarqawi, while Jordan's king said Iraq was  too dangerous for elections to be held in January.<p> 
			
			King Abdullah, one of Washington's staunchest Middle East  allies, said he didn't see how national polls could go ahead  amid such violence. His comments came after Secretary of State  Colin Powell admitted the insurgency was worsening.<p> 
			
			"It seems impossible to me to organize indisputable  elections in the chaos we see today," the king told French  daily Le Figaro before meeting President Jacques Chirac in  Paris.<p> 
			
			"If the elections take place in the current disorder, the  best-organized faction will be that of the extremists and the  result will reflect that advantage."<p> 
			
			U.S. forces struck against militants across the country.<p> 
			
			In Falluja, the military said it had hit a house used by  Zarqawi's followers, who have claimed responsibility for  several attacks in Iraq and the beheadings of foreign hostages.<p> 
			
			It said the air strike targeted high-level members of the  group, but did not say how many people were killed. The U.S.  military last week claimed to have killed around 100 of  Zarqawi's followers in the past few weeks.<p> 
			
			In Sadr City, a poor Shi'ite Muslim district of  northeastern Baghdad, residents said U.S. aircraft and tanks  bombarded homes in some neighborhoods, ratcheting up operations  against Shi'ite militiamen who have the area largely under  their control.<p> 
			
			The strikes wiped out the district's power, residents said.<p> 
			
			In a statement, U.S. forces said they had conducted  "precision strikes" on various targets, and at the same time  denied reports on Arabic TV and in Western newspapers of heavy  civilian casualties, with up to 10 killed and 46 wounded.<p> 
			
			Separately, the military said it had captured an insurgent  leader during a raid north of Baghdad. A statement said Hussein  Salman Mohammad al-Jabburi was seized near Kirkuk on Monday.<p> 
			
			In the southern city of Basra, insurgents ambushed a convoy  of armored Land Rovers, killing two British soldiers, a British  army spokesman said. The deaths raised to 25 the number of  British troops killed in action in Iraq.<p> 
			
			And in Ramadi, another insurgent stronghold west of  Baghdad, police and witnesses said a suicide car bomber  detonated his vehicle near a U.S. convoy, killing several  people, although the reports could not immediately be verified.<p>
