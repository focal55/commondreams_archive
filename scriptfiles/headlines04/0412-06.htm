			CRAWFORD, Texas  - Egyptian President Hosni  Mubarak told President Bush on Monday he had "serious concerns"  about the violence in Iraq, and Bush defended the U.S.  crackdown against Sunnis and Shi'ites as necessary to clear the  way for a transition to Iraqi rule.

Under increasing pressure to outline a clear plan for Iraq,  Bush announced he would hold a rare, prime-time news conference  on Tuesday night in the White House East Room.
<p> 
			
			"The situation in Iraq has improved," Bush insisted, though  the past week has seen some of the bloodiest fighting since the  fall of Saddam Hussein.
<p> 
			
			Bush and Mubarak, meeting on a gray, chilly day at the U.S.  president's central Texas ranch, emerged from their talks to  declare Israel's proposal to withdraw from the Gaza Strip as a  positive development so long as it is part of the U.S.-backed  peace "road map" envisioning a Palestinian state by 2005.
<p> 
			
			Bush said if Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon "were to  decide to withdraw from the Gaza, it would be a positive  development" if it does not replace the road map.
<p> 
			
			Mubarak said "any withdrawal from the occupied territory is  very highly appreciated" but "will not be accepted by the  public opinion in the area" if not part of the peace plan.
<p> 
			
			Sharon has proposed evacuating Israeli settlements in  hard-to-defend enclaves in the Gaza Strip and setting up a new  "security line" in the West Bank.
<p> 
			
			IRAQ OVERSHADOWS MEETING
<p> 
			
			The meeting with Mubarak kicked off a week of diplomacy by  Bush, who is slated to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel  Sharon on Wednesday in Washington and Jordan's King Abdullah  next week to lay the groundwork for Israel's withdrawal.
<p> 
			
			But the renewed effort by Bush on the Israeli-Palestinian  peace process was overshadowed by the bloody violence in Iraq,  where U.S. military officials requested more troops on Monday  to combat a Sunni insurgency in central Iraq and a Shi'ite  revolt in the south.
<p> 
			
			Coalition forces reported about 70 deaths this month alone  compared to 89 killed in action in the three-week war a year  ago that toppled Saddam.
<p> 
			
			Mubarak raised his concerns at the start of the news  conference with Bush, reflecting Arab apprehension about the  deteriorating situation in Iraq.
<p> 
			
			"On Iraq, I conveyed to the president our serious concerns  about the current state of affairs, particularly in the  security and the humanitarian areas," Mubarak said.
<p> 
			
			He said he stressed the importance of restoring Iraq's  sovereignty as soon as possible while preserving its  territorial integrity. The administration has proposed  returning power to the Iraqis June 30, but has faced increasing  difficulty getting the process underway.
<p> 
			
			Mubarak also called for more efforts to increase the role  of the United Nations.
<p> 
			
			Bush defended U.S. tactics and said U.N. representative  Lakhdar Brahimi was already in Baghdad working on a system for  transferring sovereignty.
<p> 
			
			He insisted U.S. military forces had acted against  "lawlessness and gangs" trying to derail the transition to  democracy, and that "you just can't let, you know, a small  percentage of the Iraqi people decide the fate of everybody and  that's what you're seeing."
<p> 
			
			"Our job is to provide security for the Iraqi people so  that a transition can take place. And that's what you were  seeing," he said. "And our job also is to protect American  lives. If our soldiers are at risk, they will defend  themselves."
<p> 
			
			Bush meets in Washington with Sharon on Wednesday.
<p> 
			
			U.S. and Israeli officials last week reached tentative  agreement on key components of the Israeli plan, and Bush was  expected to back it as an interim step.
<p> 
			
			U.S. and Israeli officials want to make sure the withdrawal  does not allow the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas to cement  its grip over Palestinian affairs in Gaza, where the militants  have been a powerful force.
<p> 
			
Egypt has offered to secure its side of the border with  Gaza, a move Israel sees as crucial to stanching the flow of  weapons to Hamas.
