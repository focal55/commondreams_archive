<p>MADISON, Wis. - Democratic presidential  challenger John Kerry ripped into President Bush on Sunday for  saying he had no regrets over his "Mission Accomplished" speech  on Iraq and would do it again.
<P>
Kerry, expressed outrage after Bush's statement in an  interview with Fox News in which he was asked if he would still  have shown up in a flight suit for that May 1, 2003 speech  aboard an aircraft carrier off the coast of California.
<P>
"Absolutely," Bush was quoted as saying in excerpts of the  interview, which is to air this week.
<P>
Kerry, arriving in Madison, Wisconsin for debate  preparations, called the statement "unbelievable."
<P>
"I will never be a president who just says mission  accomplished. I will get the mission accomplished," said the  Massachusetts senator. "That's the difference."
<P>
When Bush gave his dramatic speech amid much fanfare, fewer  than 150 Americans had been killed in the Iraq war. Since then  the U.S. death toll has risen to 1,046.
<P>
Bush did not use the phrase "Mission Accomplished," but  that message was emblazoned on a prominent banner directly  behind the president as he declared major combat operations  over in Iraq.
<P>
Bush's interview is to air on Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor"  on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, just before Bush and Kerry  face off in their first televised debate on Thursday.
<P>
<b>FINAL DEBATE PREPARATIONS
</b>
<P>
Iraq and the war on terror will be the central issues in  the debate, which will focus on foreign affairs.
<P>
The 90-minute face-off in Coral Gables, Florida will be the  first of three presidential debates in the run-up to the Nov. 2  election and many analysts think it is Kerry's best chance to  try to overtake Bush, who leads slightly in the polls.
<P>&nbsp;Bush spent the weekend at his Crawford, Texas ranch to  practice for the debate and relax by riding his mountain  bicycle and going fishing.
<P>
Apart from a day trip to Ohio on Monday, Bush will remain  at the ranch until Wednesday, when he flies to Florida.
<P>
Meanwhile, Kerry and a group of senior aides headed for a  resort 40 miles from Madison, Wisconsin -- an important  battleground state.
<P>
"It's a remote area where we can concentrate and focus and  still get out to talk to voters as much as possible," said  Kerry spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter.
<P>
Bush held a mock debate on Saturday night with Republican  Sen. Judd Gregg playing the role of Kerry. Like Kerry, Gregg,  who hails from New Hampshire, is a New Englander.
<P>
Kerry's aides gave only sparse details of the candidate's  debate preparations, although Cutter said he had done at least  one run-through with lawyer Greg Craig role-playing as Bush.
<P>
Craig, a friend of Kerry's, was White House special counsel  during former President Bill Clinton's impeachment drama.
<P>
Kerry has watched videotapes of some of Bush's past  debates, including those with Democrat Ann Richards when Bush  ran for Texas governor, according to Cutter.
<P>
She said she expects Bush will try to pin the flip-flopper  label on Kerry as the president has done during his campaign.
<P>
The Bush team was eager to manage expectations. White House  communications director Dan Bartlett talked up Kerry's  experience as a debater, citing his 20 years in the Senate and  his participation on his prep school's debate team.
<P>
But he predicted Bush would "hold his own" on Thursday.  "Will President Bush step on his own line and maybe not  pronounce a word right?" Bartlett said. "I bet he will but I  think after the 90 minutes there won't be any ambiguity in his  positions."
