<p>WASHINGTON - U.S. Africa and AIDS  activists are hailing as a major breakthrough a new international agreement announced this week that will bring life-saving anti-AIDS drugs within reach of millions of victims of the disease.
 <p>
 The fact that former President Bill Clinton's foundation helped negotiate the deal, which will reduce the cost of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of anti-retroviral drugs to as little as US&#36;140 a year, should also increase pressure on President Bush to abandon his administration's efforts to block the use of U.S. aid money to buy the drugs, according to the groups.
 <p>
 "Now is the time for President Bush and (his Global AIDS Coordinator, Amb. Randall) Tobias to get with the program, or else risk U.S. tax dollars," said Dr. Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance (GAA). "This plan is simply tremendous news for countries fighting AIDS, and it's exactly the kind of leadership that's needed."
 <p>
 The deal, which also involved the World Bank, UNICEF, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, was announced on the eve of scheduled testimony Wednesday by Tobias on U.S. AIDS plans. 
 <p>
 Tobias, the former CEO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, is expected to come under heavy fire from Democrats and even some Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for delaying, if not blocking, a decision to use U.S. aid money to buys generic drugs.
 <p>
 The hearing will follow a meeting in Botswana last week in which Tobias sought to persuade UN and other international agencies to delay a decision to buy generic FDCs until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) or a similar drug regulatory authority in a wealthy industrialized nation performs new assessments to determine their safety and effectiveness. 
 <p>
 Using criteria considered similar to those of the FDA, the World Health Organization (WHO) had already approved the use of dozens of generic anti-AIDS medications for use by other UN agencies, national governments, the World Bank, the Global Fund, and a number of international health groups, such as Doctors Without Borders.
 <p>
 The meeting, described as extremely contentious broke up without reaching a consensus--indeed, the European Union's drug regulation authority boycotted the meeting to protest Washington's tactics--and amid charges that Tobias and the Bush administration were simply trying to protect the interests of U.S. brand-name pharmaceutical companies. The companies are deeply concerned that cut-rate prices offered by generic drug manufacturers in India, Brazil, South Africa and other developing countries will cut them out of a major source of revenue.
 <p>
 "Last week's conference in Botswana demonstrated that there are no limits to the Bush administration's crusade to protect the profits of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry," said Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action.
 <p>
 "Yesterday's announcement by the Clinton Foundation reflects the strong international consensus on the critical role these generics can play in saving millions of Africa lives," he added. "The Bush administration needs to meet its responsibilities and get in step with the rest of the international community."
 <p>
 AIDS, which is currently killing roughly 8,000 people a day around the world and 6,000 in sub-Saharan Africa alone, is widely considered the most devastating epidemic in recorded history. The UN estimates that 5 million people were infected with the AIDS-causing HIV virus last year alone.
 <p>
 Out of the roughly 6 million people who need the anti-retroviral drugs that preserve the life and health of AIDS victims, however, only about 300,000 in the world's poorest nations are receiving them.
 <p>
 Last year, the WHO launched its "3 x 5 initiative," a program designed to increase the number of needy in poor countries who are receiving the drugs ten-fold--to three million--by the end of 2005. 
 <p>
 In the absence of a major infusion of donor money, however, that goal will be impossible to reach unless the price of the drugs is quickly and sharply reduced. The deal announced this week, which must still be reviewed by manufacturers in India and South Africa, is certain to inject new momentum into the 3 x 5 effort.
 <p>
 "The WHO's goal is now a step closer to reality," said Zeitz who called it a "powerful challenge to President Bush's ideological insistence that U.S. global AIDS programs buy brand-name AIDS medication."
 <p>
 While the generic versions of FDCs, which combine drugs from multiple sources into single pills that are taken twice daily, will cost as little as &#36;140 per person per year, the same combination from brand-name companies is currently priced at at least &#36;560 per year and must be taken in the form of six pills a day.
 <p>
 Washington's backing for generic FDCs is seen as critical, because the U.S. is by far the largest donor to the global AIDS effort. For this year, for example, Congress approved &#36;550 million for the Global Fund out of a total of about &#36;2.1 billion for all global AIDS spending. Bush has asked Congress for about &#36;2.7 billion in 2005, about-one third of which would be spent on treatment.
<p>
 The activist groups are not alone in pressing the administration to relax its opposition to generics. Among others, Sens. Edward and John McCain have urged the White House to accept WHO-approved generics and integrate them into the U.S. aid program.
<p>
Analysts said the timing of this week's announcement by Clinton appeared designed to exert maximum pressure on the administration to change its position, particularly in light of the failure of last week's meeting in Botswana.
<p>
"This historic drug pricing and distribution deal is a powerful slap to President Bush's arrogant attempts to limit the use of generic AIDS medicines to suit the whims of this pharmaceutical backers," said Paul Davis from Health Global Access Project, or Health GAP. "Clinton has thrown a spanner in the works, slowing the Bush administration's shameful efforts to use their AIDS relief program to create a slush fund for big Pharma."
<p>
"The Clinton approach represents the direction Bush administration policy should take, if the White House is serious about fighting AIDS," Davis said, noting that the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, has already come out in support of the use of generic AIDS drugs to deal with the crisis.
<p>
In a forum last week at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, Clinton's former UN ambassador, Richard Holbrooke, also scolded the administration for opposing the use of generics, charging that "it's tearing apart all the good work that people are doing because there is a feeling that United States is protecting the big (pharmaceutical companies)."
<p>
"We are getting hammered on this in the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS," which is headed by Holbrooke and represents 140 multinational companies that have pledged to support global efforts to fight the disease.
