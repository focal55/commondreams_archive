RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian President  Yasser Arafat said on Saturday he was unmoved by a threat by  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to assassinate him which  had drawn criticism from the United States.<p> 
			
			Arafat was speaking to reporters at his battered  headquarters in Ramallah hours after a Palestinian gunman  infiltrated a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, killing a  settler and wounding his 12-year-old daughter before soldiers  shot the attacker dead.<p> 
			
			In interviews with Israeli newspapers on Friday, Sharon had  issued his most explicit threat yet against Arafat, calling the  Palestinian leader a poor insurance risk.<p> 
			
			"I don't care for it. I am caring for my people, for our  children, for our women, for our students," Arafat, speaking in  English, said in his first response to Sharon's remarks.<p> 
			
			The United States criticized Sharon's comments, but  Israel's Internal Security Minister Tsahi Hanegbi defended the  prime minister's remarks on Saturday and noted that U.S. forces  had killed militants in Iraq and Afghanistan.<p> 
			
			The Hamas militant group claimed responsibility for the  attack on the West Bank settlement. In telephone calls to  Reuters, it said it was done "to avenge the assassination" on  March 22 of the group's leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, by an  Israeli helicopter strike in Gaza.<p> 
			
			Hamas has waged a decade-old campaign of attacks against  Israelis, including suicide bombings that have killed hundreds.<p> 
			
			Israeli soldiers later launched arrest sweeps in two West  Bank towns, and took 23 Palestinian suspects into custody in  Nablus, a military source and witnesses said.<p> 
			
			ISRAEL REBUFFS U.S. CRITICISM<p> 
			
			Sharon, who is under fire in Israel over his plan for a  unilateral Gaza pullout and over a bribery scandal, singled out  Arafat and Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon's  Hizbollah guerrilla group, in his media interviews.<p> 
			
			"I wouldn't suggest either one of them should feel secure.  I wouldn't propose that any insurance company give them  coverage," Sharon told Israel's Haaretz daily.<p> 
			
			"Anyone who kills a Jew or harms an Israeli citizen, or  sends someone to kill Jews, is a marked man. Period."<p> 
			
			Israel accuses Arafat of fomenting violence, an allegation  he denies.<p> 
			
			Responding to Sharon's comments, Deputy Secretary of State  Richard Armitage told reporters in Washington:<p> 
			
			"Our position on such questions -- the exile or  assassination of Yasser Arafat -- is very well known. We are  opposed and we have made that very clear to the government of  Israel."<p> 
			
			Hanegbi strongly rebuffed Washington's criticism, telling  Israel Radio "it seems to me that it should be the last one  that can preach to us about how to implement our right to  self-defense."<p> 
			
			Hanegbi asserted that U.S. forces had been killing militant  leaders in Iraq and Afghanistan "some of whom haven't touched a  hair on the head of any American in the United States." He  noted last year's killing of Saddam Hussein's two sons by U.S.  forces.<p> 
			
			Israel's government declared in September that Arafat --  holed up in his battered headquarters in the West Bank city of  Ramallah for more than two years -- should be "removed," but  then backed off the threat amid strong international criticism.<p> 
			
			Describing the attack on the settlement of Avnei Hafetz  near the West Bank city of Tulkarm, army Captain Jacob Dallal  said an armed militant broke through its perimeter fence at  12:45 a.m. (1845 EST) and approached a row of houses.<p> 
			
			The militant went to a house with its lights on, broke a  window and fired through, wounding a girl of 12, he said.<p> 
			
			"The father had meanwhile grabbed a pistol and went outside  to see what was going on. He found the terrorist but was shot  by him and died later," Dallal told Reuters. "An army unit  arrived, engaged the Palestinian and shot him dead."<p>
