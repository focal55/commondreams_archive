<p>NEW YORK  - A New York concert promoter has  mounted an online campaign to "draft" Bruce Springsteen to  headline a rock 'n roll show to upstage the Republican National  Convention on the night it nominates President Bush to run for  another term.<p> 
			
			The "Concert for Change," would be held Sept. 1 at Giants  Stadium, across the Hudson River from the Republicans' meeting  at Madison Square Garden, said promoter and Democratic activist  Andrew Rasiej, who has reserved the date at Springsteen's New  Jersey home venue that he routinely sells out when he tours.<p> 
			
			"This is a simple idea that captures the imagination of  Americans opposed to George Bush," Rasiej told Reuters.<p> 
			
			An online petition at <a href="http://www.draftbruce.com" target="_new">www.draftbruce.com</a> has been signed by  about 50,000 people in 10 days since it was launched, Rasiej  said, adding he had also reached out to acts such as REM, The  Dave Matthews Band, Bob Dylan and Carlos Santana.
<p> 
			
"When it gets to half a million or so I would formally try  to deliver the petition to Bruce's people directly," he said.<p> 
			
			"I've spoken to the manager of REM, to Bon Jovi's people  and the rest of the names I've mentioned and they all said, 'if  you build it, we will be there."'<p> 
			
			Rasiej said he envisions drawing a big TV audience, but  only if he can get a star of the magnitude of Springsteen to  get on board and encourage other big acts to take part.<p> 
			
			Springsteen's publicist was not available for comment.<p> 
			
			Republicans and Democrats both asked to use his 1984 hit  "Born in the U.S.A." -- a song about how unwelcoming America  was to returning Vietnam veterans but often mistaken for a  patriotic anthem -- for use in political campaigns. Springsteen  declined the requests.<p> 
			
			The New Jersey rocker has typically stayed out of politics,  but in May posted the text of an anti-war speech by former Vice  President Al Gore on his official Web site, calling it "one of  the most important speeches I've heard in a long time."<p> 
			
			Rasiej, founder of popular New York rock club Irving Plaza,  said a "VoteAid" show could win a large TV audience, raise  money to support voter registration and deliver a message that  could affect the November presidential election.
