WASHINGTON  - House Democrats urged a special counsel on Wednesday to probe whether Vice President Dick Cheney  broke the law through any involvement in the award of a government contract in Iraq to his old company, Halliburton Co. 

<p>

 For the second day running, Democrats demanded more answers

to questions raised by a newly unearthed Army e-mail that said

Cheney's office "coordinated" action on a contract to rebuild

Iraq's oil infrastructure that was awarded to Halliburton.

 <p>

 Eleven Democratic members of the House of Representatives

wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft  asking him to name a

special counsel to investigate Cheney's role.

 <p>

 "The public deserves to know the truth about whether the

Vice President has illegally commingled his official and

personal dealings," said the letter from Rep. John Conyers of

Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary

Committee, and 10 other House lawmakers.

 <p>

 In the Senate, the Democratic leader said Cheney needed to

explain himself in light of fresh questions about whether he

had helped his old firm get the no-bid oil infrastructure

contract last year.

 <p>

 "This is a very serious charge ... if indeed it is true,

then it not only ought to be investigated, but corrective

action needs to be taken," Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota

told reporters outside the Senate.

 <p>

 "Certainly an explanation from Vice President Cheney and

the White House is called for. The sooner that happens, the

better," Daschle said.

 <p>

 Cheney's office and the Pentagon  have denied that he helped

steer the March, 2003 contract to the oilfield services giant

where he had been the chief executive from 1995 until he joined

George W. Bush's presidential ticket in 2000.

 <p>

 But with Bush and Cheney campaigning for reelection in

national elections approaching in November, Democrats have

seized on the e-mail as fresh ammunition against the Republican

White House.

 <p>

 A spokesman said the Justice Department would review the

Democrats' letter to Ashcroft. "We'll review the letter, and

respond accordingly," Blain Rethmeier said.

 <p>

 The March 5, 2003, Pentagon e-mail, sent by an U.S. Army

Corps of Engineers official, was first reported by Time

magazine on the weekend. It had located the e-mail among

documents provided by Judicial Watch, a watchdog group.

 <p>

 The e-mail said Douglas Feith, who reports to Deputy

Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, approved arrangements for the

contract to rebuild Iraq's oil industry "contingent on

informing WH (White House) tomorrow. We anticipate no issues

since action has been coordinated w VP's (vice president's)

office."

 <p>

 Its appearance revived Democratic calls on Capitol Hill for

hearings into various details of U.S. government deals

involving Halliburton, the biggest contractor in Iraq.

 <p>

 But Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, chair of the

Senate Governmental Affairs committee, says the panel will not

be taking any action because Halliburton's contracts in Iraq

already face probes by the General Accounting Office, defense

auditors and the Pentagon inspector general.

 <p>

 U.S. officials have estimated the Texas company's Iraq

deals, for everything from oil repairs to meals for the troops,

could eventually total some &#36;18 billion.

 <p>

 The March 2003 no-bid contract handed out by the U.S. Army

Corps of Engineers promised the company about &#36;2.5 billion for

rebuilding Iraq's oil industry. It was replaced in January 2004

by two contracts totaling &#36;2 billion, with Halliburton

retaining work in southern Iraq for &#36;1.2 billion.
