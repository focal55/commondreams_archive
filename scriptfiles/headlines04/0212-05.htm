<p>NEW YORK  -  Matt Drudge's Web site, which first broke allegations about President Bill Clinton's dalliance with a White House intern in 1998, is at it again.
<p>Late this morning, <a href="http://www.DrudgeReport.com" target="_new">DrudgeReport.com</a> alleged that a new scandal was about to rock the campaign of Democratic frontrunner John Kerry: some sort of purported recent marital "infidelity" that involved a woman who once worked for the Associated Press, and has now supposedly "fled the country." According to the site, this story was being investigated by the AP, The Washington Post, Time magazine and ABC network.
<p>Reached by E&amp;P for comment, AP spokesman Jack Stokes said, "We simply don't comment on stories we are pursuing or not pursuing."
<p>The Drudge site also declared that General Wesley Clark, in an off-the-record chat with reporters earlier this week, predicted that the Kerry campaign would soon implode due to an "intern." It would seem strange, however, if he really believed that, that he would drop out of the race, as he did yesterday.<p>The site added, however, that the Kerry rumor helped explain why Howard Dean did stay in the race and has been increasingly aggressive in his attacks on Kerry this week.
