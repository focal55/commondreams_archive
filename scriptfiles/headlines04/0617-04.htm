<p>WASHINGTON - 

The U.S. military has been
improperly holding a suspected Iraqi terrorist in a prison near
Baghdad for more than seven months without informing the Red
Cross, the Pentagon  said on Thursday.
<p>
 Defense officials confirmed that Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld ordered military officials to hold the suspected
member of the Ansar al-Islam guerrilla group last November at
the request of then-CIA  Director George Tenet without telling
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
<p>
 Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told Reuters the United
States was now moving to end the shadowy status of the man, who
was not identified, and allow access to him by the ICRC.
<p>
 Both assigning a prisoner number and notifying the Red
Cross are required under the Geneva Conventions and other
international humanitarian laws.
<p>
 "I will acknowledge that the ICRC should have been notified
about this prisoner earlier," Whitman said. "He will be
assigned an identification number and, if appropriate, moved
into the general prison population."
<p>
 The report came as the United States continued to conduct a
major investigation into the abuse, including sexual
humiliation, of prisoners by the U.S. military in both Iraq and
Afghanistan.
<p>
 'HIGH-VALUE' DETAINEE
<p>
 Whitman confirmed a report in Thursday's New York Times
that Tenet -- who recently resigned as CIA chief -- had asked
Rumsfeld to make the move last year after the "high-value"
detainee, believed to have been actively involved in planning
attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq, was captured.
<p>
 "The director of central intelligence (Tenet) wanted him
held without notification while the CIA worked to determine his
value," Whitman said.
<p>
 The man has been held at Camp Cropper, a high-security
facility near Baghdad Airport, and has apparently been lost in
the system in recent months, according to other U.S. officials,
who asked not to be identified. Whitman said the military's
Central Command had recently sought clarification from the
Pentagon on the status of the detainee.
<p>
 Washington has linked Ansar al-Islam to al Qaeda and blames
the group for some attacks in Iraq.
<p>
 "He has been treated humanely," Whitman told Reuters.
<p>
 Although the United States says that all prisoners in Iraq
are treated humanely and strictly under rules of war
established by the Red Cross, the Times said the prisoner and
other so-called "ghost detainees" were hidden largely to
prevent the ICRC from monitoring their treatment and
conditions.
<p>
 In March, Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba, the U.S. Army officer
who investigated abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad,
criticized the practice of allowing ghost detainees as
"deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine, and in violation of
international law."
<p>
 Whitman said it was appropriate to hold detainees for brief
periods without notification if they were viewed as an "active
threat" in wartime. But he acknowledged that the man was held
too long under those conditions in this case.
<p>
 "Once he was placed in military custody, people lost track
of him," a senior intelligence official told The New York
Times.
