<p>WASHINGTON --
Deep divisions are emerging at the top of the U.S. military over the 
course of the occupation of Iraq, with some senior officers beginning to say 
that the United States is facing the prospect of casualties for years without 
achieving its stated goal of establishing a free and democratic Iraq.
<P>Their major worry is that the United States is prevailing militarily, yet 
failing to win the support of the Iraqi people. That view is far from 
universal  --  but it is spreading, and being voiced publicly for the first 
time.
<P>Maj. Gen. Charles Swannack, the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, 
who spent much of the year in western Iraq, said he believes that at the 
tactical level at which fighting occurs, the U.S. military is still winning. 
But when asked whether he believes the United States is losing, he said, "I 
think strategically, we are."
<P>Army Col. Paul Hughes, who last year was the first director of strategic 
planning for the U.S. occupation authority in Baghdad, said he agrees with 
that view. He noted that a pattern of winning battles while losing a war 
characterized the U.S. failure in Vietnam. "Unless we ensure that we have 
coherency in our policy, we will lose strategically," he said in an interview 
Friday.
<P>"I lost my brother in Vietnam," added Hughes, a veteran Army strategist 
who is still involved in formulating Iraq policy. "I promised myself, when I 
came on active duty, that I would do everything in my power to prevent that 
from happening again. Here I am, 30 years later, thinking we will win every 
fight and lose the war, because we don't understand the war we're in."
<P>The emergence of sharp differences over U.S. strategy has set off a 
debate, a year after the United States ostensibly won the war in Iraq, about 
how to preserve that victory. The core question is how to end a festering 
insurrection that has stymied some reconstruction efforts, made many Iraqis 
feel less safe and created uncertainty about who actually will run the country 
after the scheduled turnover of political sovereignty on June 30.
<P>Both inside and outside the armed forces, experts generally are arguing 
that the U.S. military should remain there but should change its approach. 
Some argue for more troops, others for fewer, but they generally agree on 
revising the Bush administration's stated goals to make them less ambitious. 
They are worried by evidence that the United States is losing ground with the 
Iraqi public.
<P>Some officers say the place to begin overhauling U.S. policy is by 
ousting Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, whom they see as responsible for a 
series of strategic and tactical blunders over the past year. Several of those 
interviewed said a profound anger is building within the Army at Rumsfeld and 
those around him.
<P>A senior general at the Pentagon said he believes the United States is 
already on the road to defeat. "It is doubtful we can go on much longer like 
this," he said. "The American people may not stand for it  --  and they should 
not."
<P>Asked who was to blame, the general pointed directly at Rumsfeld and 
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. "I do not believe we had a clearly 
defined war strategy, end state and exit strategy before we commenced our 
invasion," he said. "Had someone like Colin Powell been the chairman (of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff), he would not have agreed to send troops without a 
clear exit strategy. The current OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense) 
refused to listen or adhere to military advice."
<P>Like several other officers interviewed for this story,  the general 
spoke only on the condition that his name not be used. One reason for this is 
that some of these officers deal frequently with the senior Pentagon civilian 
officials they are criticizing, and some remain dependent on top officials to 
approve their current efforts and future promotions. Some say they believe 
that Rumsfeld and other top civilians punish public dissent. Senior officers 
frequently cite what they believe was the vindictive treatment of then-Army 
chief of staff Gen. Eric Shinseki after he said early last year that the 
administration was underestimating the number of U.S. troops that would be 
required in postwar Iraq.
<P>Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's No. 2 official, said he doesn't think the 
United States is losing in Iraq, and he said no senior officer has expressed 
that thought to him, either. "I am sure that there are some out there" who 
think that, he said in an interview Saturday.
<P>"There's no question that we're facing some difficulties," Wolfowitz said.
"I don't mean to sound Pollyanna-ish  --  we all know that we're facing a 
tough problem." But, he added, "I think the course we've set is the right one, 
which is moving as rapidly as possible to Iraqi self-government and Iraqi self-
defense."
<P>Wolfowitz, who is widely seen as the intellectual architect of the Bush 
administration's desire to create a free and democratic Iraq that will begin 
the transformation of the politics of the Middle East, also strongly rejected 
the idea of scaling back on that aim.
<P>"The goal has never been to win the Olympic high jump in democracy," he 
said. Moving toward democratization in Iraq will take time, he said. Yet, he 
continued, "I don't think the answer is to find some old Republican Guard 
generals and have them impose yet another dictatorship in an Arab country."
<P>The top U.S. commander in the war also said he strongly disagrees with 
the view that the United States is heading toward defeat. "We are not losing, 
militarily," Army Gen. John Abizaid said in an interview Friday. He said the U.
S. military is winning tactically. But he stopped short of being as positive 
about the overall trend. Rather, he said, "Strategically, I think there are 
opportunities."
<P>The prisoner abuse scandal and the continuing car bombings and U.S. 
casualties "create the image of a military that's not being effective in the 
counterinsurgency," he said, but in reality, "The truth of the matter is ... 
there are some good signals out there."
<P>Commanders on the ground in Iraq seconded that cautiously optimistic view.
<P>"I am sure that the view from Washington is much worse than it appears on 
the ground here in Baquba," said Col. Dana J.H. Pittard, commander of a 1st 
Infantry Division brigade based in that city about 40 miles north of Baghdad. 
"I do not think that we are losing, but we will lose if we are not careful."
<P>Lt. Col. John Kem, a battalion commander in Baghdad, said the events of 
the last two months  --  first the eruption of a Shiite insurgency, followed 
by the detainee abuse scandal  --  "certainly made things harder," but he said 
he doubted they would have much effect on the long-term future of Iraq.
<P>But some say that behind those official positions lies deep concern.
<P>One Pentagon consultant said officials with whom he works on Iraq policy 
continue to put a happy face publicly, but privately are grim about the 
situation in Baghdad. When it comes to discussions of the administration's 
Iraq policy, he said, "It's 'Dead Man Walking.' "
<P>A senior U.S. military intelligence officer experienced in Middle Eastern 
affairs said he thinks the Bush administration needs to rethink its approach 
to Iraq and to the region. "The idea that Iraq can be miraculously and quickly 
turned into a shining example of democracy that will 'transform' the Middle 
East requires way too much fairy dust and cultural arrogance to believe," he 
said.
<P>Even if adjustments in troop presence and goals help the United States 
prevail, it will not happen anytime soon, several of those interviewed said. 
The United States is likely to be fighting in Iraq for "at least" another five 
years, said an Army officer who served there. "We'll be taking casualties" 
during that entire time, he warned.
<P>A long-term problem for any administration is that it may be difficult 
for the American public to tell whether the United States is winning or losing,
and the prospect of continued casualties raises the question of how long the 
public will tolerate the fighting.
<P>"Iraq might have been worth doing at some price," said defense consultant 
Michael Vickers. "But it isn't worth doing at any price. And the price has 
gone very high."
<P>Tolerance of the situation in Iraq also appears to be declining within 
the U.S. military. Especially among career Army officers, an extraordinary 
anger is building at Rumsfeld and his top advisers.
<P>"Like a lot of senior Army guys, I'm quite angry" with Rumsfeld and the 
rest of the Bush administration, said the young general. He listed two reasons.
"One is, I think they are going to break the Army." But what really incites 
him, he said, is, "I don't think they care."
