<p>Hearst News Service columnist Helen Thomas has
unambiguous feelings about the Bush administration.</p>

<p>"This government lies," she said Wednesday to
editors, reporters and interns from The Indianapolis Star.</p>




<p>As for the Bush administration's claims that Iraq
had weapons of mass destruction, one of the key arguments for going
to war against Saddam Hussein, Thomas had one word: "Baloney."</p>

<p>"I think we have a government that absolutely is
ignoring the truth and a press that is ignoring the truth," she
said during a luncheon at the Downtown Radisson Hotel.</p>

<p>Thomas, 83, who worked for United Press
International for 57 years as a correspondent and White House
bureau chief, began covering the Oval Office during the Kennedy
administration.</p>

<p>The columnist said she thinks the press today is
doing a terrible job covering the presidency -- worse than she ever
has seen.</p>

<p>"I really think that reporters for two, three
months after 9/11 -- everyone was afraid to ask their question,"
Thomas said. "They would not ask any question that would appear to
be unpatriotic."</p>

<p>This reticent culture continued into the war in
Iraq, where reporters feared questions would be perceived as
jeopardizing American troops, Thomas said.</p>

<p>"I think she's absolutely right -- dead on," said
James W. Brown, executive associate dean of the Indiana University
School of Journalism at IUPUI. "The evidence is there -- the Bush
administration lies, lies, lies.</p>

<p>"The strongest, most aggressive person taking the
Bush administration to task is not someone from The New York Times
or The Washington Post, but Michael Moore, albeit from his own
viewpoint," Brown said. "He is asking the questions."</p>

<p>But Rich Noyes, research director of the
Virginia-based Media Research Center, which describes itself as a
conservative media watchdog group, said Thomas' remarks were "a
totally fictional account of what happened since 9/11."</p>

<p>"By early 2002, it was really back to normal, with
reporters asking many, many tough questions both about domestic
policy and foreign policy," Noyes said. He said his group
documented heavy skepticism toward the war in Iraq.</p>

<p>"When Helen Thomas says the press was too soft,
what she really means is the press should have been more of an
actor in the process instead of covering the process," Noyes said.
"That's just not the right role for a journalist."</p>

<p>Thomas openly acknowledges her politics -- "I was
born a liberal, and I'll die a liberal," she said -- but added that
they were not reflected in her work as a reporter. She called the
notion of a liberal bias in the media fictitious.</p><p align="center">&copy; 2004 IndyStar.com </p>
