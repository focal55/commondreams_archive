BAGHDAD  - The courts-martial of three U.S. military police charged with abusing prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison begin this week under tight security in the Iraqi capital.

<p>Sergeant Ivan Frederick is to face the court at the Camp Victory military base starting Wednesday and Sergeant Javal Davis and Specialist Charles Graner face motion hearings later in the week, the military said in a statement.

<p>Lawyers for the three could not be immediately contacted, but U.S. media quoted Frederick's lawyer saying he would plead guilty to four charges of abusing prisoners, including assault and committing an indecent act.

<p>U.S. military officials in Baghdad could not immediately be contacted for comment.

<p>Some witnesses are expected to give evidence by video link from the United States. The army has extended active duty for 14 fellow reservists who are potential witnesses.

<p>U.S. abuses at Abu Ghraib, notorious for executions and torture under Saddam Hussein, came to light in April when photographs were published of naked, hooded prisoners being sexually humiliated and threatened with dogs.

<p>A high level inquiry into the scandal, headed by former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, accused the military chain of command from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld down of leadership failures that created the conditions for abuse.

<p>In all, seven military police personnel and an intelligence soldier have been indicted for abusing Iraqi detainees in the affair, which provoked world outrage.

<p>Among them is Private Lynndie England, the woman photographed in many of the pictures with Abu Ghraib inmates. She gave birth last week and Graner is the child's father.

<p>Last month, the first U.S. military intelligence soldier to be court-martialled over the abuse scandal was sentenced to eight months in jail, a reduction in rank and a bad conduct discharge.

<p>Specialist Armin Cruz, 24, had pleaded guilty to maltreatment and conspiracy to maltreat detainees.

<p>Cruz's case was significant because the Pentagon maintains the abuse was the work of a few renegade military police acting on their own, not on the orders of intelligence personnel.

<p>Cruz was the second person to be tried. The first, Private Jeremy Sivits, pleaded guilty at a special court martial in Baghdad in May and was sentenced to a year in prison.
