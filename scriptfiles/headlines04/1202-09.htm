<p>A new national television commercial promoting the United Church of Christ "Jesus didn't turn people away," but two major networks have turned away the ad itself, saying it violates their policy of airing commercials on hot button topics -- such as tolerance toward gays and lesbians.

<P>CBS and NBC rejected the 30-second ad, which depicts a pair of stern bouncers barring people of various ethnic types as well as a female -- perhaps lesbian -- couple from entering a fictitious church.

<P>"No matter who you are or where you are on life's journey," a voice-over says, "you are welcome here." The "here" in the spot is the United Church of Christ, and the welcome is "regardless of ability, age, race, economic circumstance or sexual orientation," according to a church statement.

<P>The networks' rejection of the ad has spawned fresh controversy about religion and the media in the politically charged marketplace of moral values and ideas.

<P>The ad, which will run on the Fox Network and various cable channels through Dec. 26, arrives at a time of heightened sensitivity to religion's societal role in everything from gay marriage to abortion.

<P>Church officials insist they weren't trying to be political in this case, and the networks say the same.

<P>"The ad is saying that people feel alienated from the church in general. It's about the United Church of Christ welcoming all people," said Barb Powell, head of public information for the Cleveland-based Protestant denomination. "We were surprised by the networks' response."

<P>CBS and NBC cite straightforward corporate policies on accepting ads about controversial topics. ABC, said spokeswoman Julie Hoover, accepts no religious advertising on its broadcast network. However, the Disney-owned company's ABC Family cable channel will air the spot. The networks all contend that controversial topics should be handled by their news departments and not be hijacked by special-interest advertisers.

<P>But the CBS and NBC decisions not to run the ad struck chords still ringing from last month's presidential election. That's especially true with a liberally inclined church whose clergy went on the record opposing the Iraq war.

<P>"It's ironic that after a political season awash in commercials based on fear and deception by both parties seen on all the major networks, an ad with a message of welcome and inclusion would be deemed too controversial," said the Rev. John Thomas, general minister and president of the United Church of Christ, in a statement. "What's going on here?"

<P>The Rev. Kyle Lovett, pastor of St. John's United Church of Christ in San Francisco, proposed an answer. On the eve of President Bush's second term, she said, the networks "can't afford to go against the administration's version of Christianity and what counts as moral values and what doesn't count as moral values."

<P>That version, she added, "sees 'moral values' as a code word for a very narrow set of concerns -- gay marriage, abortion and stem cell research. But the term is much broader than that. It includes education, environmentalism, urban decline, the quality of our working life. The problem is that some other Christians are more organized than we are, and they're the ones out there defining the issue."

<P>"It really is like censorship," said Wilfred Glabach, pastor of First Congregational Church of San Francisco, a United Church of Christ member. "Gay and lesbian characters are all over TV shows, and people make fun of them all the time. But when something comes along that tries to treat their lives and their concerns in the church seriously, this is what happens."

<P>CBS and NBC say their policies on certain kinds of advertising are decades old. "We have a long-standing policy of not accepting advocacy ads or issue-oriented ads," said a CBS spokesperson. NBC declines ads "dealing with issues of public controversy," according to spokeswoman Shannon Jacobs. In this case, she said, the problem "stems from the ad's implication that other religions are not open to all people."

<P>A United Church of Christpress release quotes a CBS "explanation" that goes somewhat further: "Because this commercial touches on the exclusion of gay couples and other minority groups by other individuals and organizations," it reads, "and the fact that the Executive Branch has recently proposed a Constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, this spot is unacceptable for broadcast on the [CBS and UPN] networks." According to a source, the language comes from a memo directed by the CBS standards and practices division to the church's advertising agency.

<P>The rejected commercial is one of two filmed by the United Church of Christ in a $30 million campaign aimed to coincide with the denomination's 50th anniversary in 2007. Another ad, which depicts a young girl opening her steepled hands in a welcoming gesture, was accepted by both CBS and NBC. The United Church of Christ's Powell said it may run on those networks and others around Christmas and again next year during Lent.

<P>The disputed ad was test-marketed earlier this year in Cleveland, Oklahoma City, Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., Harrisburg, Pa., and several other markets. The church, which has 6,000 congregations and 1.3 million members, is spending $1.7 million to air the spot this month.

<P>In a Webcast on the United Church of Christ Web site (<a href="http://www.stillspeaking.com" target="_new">www.stillspeaking.com</a>), church spokesman Ron Buford offers this blessing on the commercial: "If Jesus was alive today," he says, "the Sermon on the Mount would be on TV."
