<p>WASHINGTON  - A majority of U.S. troops serving in  Iraq and their families said the Bush administration did not  send enough forces to Iraq and relied too heavily on the  National Guard and reserve troops, a poll showed on Saturday.
<p> 
			
			Almost two-thirds of those surveyed by the Annenberg Public  Policy Center, or 65 percent, said they believed President Bush  "had underestimated the number of troops needed in Iraq," the  poll said.<p> 
			
			But while 60 percent said part-time troops were  overburdened and the number of regular troops should have been  expanded, a larger majority, 74 percent, said they were opposed  to reinstating the draft.<p> 
			
			Annenberg researchers surveyed 186 troops who were serving  on active duty in Iraq between February and October, including  full-time, National Guard and reservist forces. If they were  not available for polling, a family member was surveyed.<p> 
			
			The results were part of a larger survey of 655 troops or  their families.<p> 
			
			Forty percent of National Guard members and reservists  surveyed said they did not have enough training or supplies for  their mission in Iraq, compared with 35 percent who said they  were adequately prepared, the poll found.<p> 
			
			Regular, full-time troops who served in Iraq said they were  generally satisfied with their training and equipment,  according to the survey.<p> 
			
			"The military, without focusing on Bush himself, also has  serious doubts about how the war has been managed," said Adam  Clymer, political director of the National Annenberg Election  Survey.<p> 
			
			Despite those doubts, the military generally supports Bush  and the efforts in Iraq, the poll showed. But support from  those who spent time in Iraq was lower by about 10 percent.<p> 
			
			Bush's Democratic challenger, Massachusetts Sen. John  Kerry, has criticized the president's handling of Iraq.<p> 
			
			On Friday, Kerry said that he did not support a draft, but  Bush's policies had stretched U.S. troops too thinly. Bush said  he would not bring back the draft.<p> 
			
			Annenberg's survey comes one day after U.S. defense  officials said they were investigating a report this week that  some U.S. troops refused to take part in a supply convoy in  Iraq, where explosive devices have killed dozens of soldiers.<p> 
			
			Military officials called the incident involving 19 members  of the 343rd Quartermaster Company "isolated," but families of  the troops told a U.S. newspaper that security for the truck  convoy was lacking.<p> 
			
			The poll, conducted from Sept. 22 to Oct. 5, also found the  military "overwhelmingly disagreed" with the administration's  photo ban of military coffins arriving at Dover Air Force Base  in Delaware.
			<p> 
			
			The Annenberg Center is a research group at the University  of Pennsylvania. The poll has a margin of error of plus or  minus 4 percentage points.
