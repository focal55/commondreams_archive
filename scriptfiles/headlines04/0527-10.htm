UNITED NATIONS - The United States may not have  enough U.N. votes to exempt American soldiers from prosecution  by a new global criminal court, with China now questioning the  action in view of the prison scandal in Iraq, diplomats said on  Thursday.
<p> 
			
			A Security Council draft resolution designed to put U.S.  peacekeepers out of the reach of the International Criminal  Court expires on July 1. A renewal was delayed last week by  China and it is expected to go before the council again after a  resolution on Iraq's transition is adopted.<p> 
			
			Two years ago the council voted unanimously in favor of the  measure when the Bush administration began to veto U.N.  peacekeeping missions after members hesitated.<p> 
			
			Last year three nations abstained but this year there are  enough abstentions that could bring the resolution perilously  close to defeat. A minimum of nine votes in favor is needed for  adoption in the 15-member council.<p> 
			
			Brazil, Spain, France and Germany have signaled they would  abstain and Chile, Romania and Benin as well as China are  considering it.<p> 
			
			But some diplomats said the resolution would squeak through  because no one wanted to see Washington kill U.N. peacekeeping  missions. "The British say they are holding their noses and  voting for it and others may do the same," said one envoy.<p> 
			
			But China's position is an unusual one as Beijing has  neither ratified nor signed the treaty establishing the court.<p> 
			
			'A VERY BAD SIGNAL'<p> 
			
			Several diplomats said that China was bargaining with the  United States over Taiwan's status in the World Trade  Organization, one of the few international bodies that admit  both Beijing and Taipei.<p> 
			
			However, China's U.N. ambassador, Wang Guangya, denied this  was the case and said the resolution was sending "a very bad  signal at this time," especially to Iraq.<p> 
			
			He told Reuters the U.S. abuse of Iraqi prisoners raised  the need for "strict observance of international law." The  resolution, he said, was a signal that "whatever you are doing,  you are being protected by the Security Council."<p> 
			
			"So we find it difficult to say 'yes' to this resolution,"  Wang said. "The United States has difficulties with ICC. We  also have difficulties, but from different points of view."<p> 
			
			The Bush administration argues that the tribunal, based in  The Hague, Netherlands, could be used for politically motivated  law suits against far-flung American soldiers. Supporters say  the court's statutes exclude countries with a proper judicial  system, like the United States, from prosecution.<p> 
			
			"The language agreed upon two years ago embodies a fair but  hard-fought compromise that allows us to participate in U.N.  peacekeeping operations, while protecting our personnel serving  in these operations," said Richard Grenell, spokesman for U.S.  Ambassador John Negroponte.<p> 
			
			The court, the first permanent global war crimes tribunal,  was set up to prosecute the world's worst atrocities, such as  genocide, mass war crimes and systematic human rights abuses.<p> 
			
			Specifically, the U.S. draft resolution would place any  soldier or official out of the court's reach from any nation if  they served on missions established or authorized by the United  Nations. This would apply to those from countries that did not  ratify the 1998 treaty creating the court.<p> 
			
			Of the 15 Security Council members, Britain, France,  Germany, Spain, Brazil, Romania and Benin are among 94 nations  that have ratified the 1998 treaty creating the court.<p> 
			
			Russia, Chile, Angola, Algeria and the Philippines, are  among 135 nations that signed the treaty. China and Pakistan  have neither signed nor ratified and the Bush administration  rescinded the U.S. signature.
