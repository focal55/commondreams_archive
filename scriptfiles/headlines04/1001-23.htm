<P>WASHINGTON  - President Bush came under fire from
a senior Senate Democrat on Thursday after the Washington Post
said the U.S. government and a representative of Bush's
reelection campaign helped draft Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad
Allawi's speech to Congress last week.


<p>Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein of California said in a
Sept. 30 letter to Bush that the newspaper report raised doubts
about Allawi's optimistic assertions on Iraqi reconstruction
efforts and the prospect for elections.
 
<p>"To learn that this was not an independent view, but one
that was massaged by your campaign operatives, jaundices the
speech and reduces the credibility of his remarks," Feinstein
said. "I hope that you'll let me know whether these claims are
accurate."
 
<p>The White House had no immediate comment on Feinstein's
letter or the Post article, which was published on Thursday as
Bush and Democratic rival John Kerry prepared to argue about
Iraq in the first of three presidential debates.
 
<p>But the Bush-Cheney campaign denied involvement in the
Allawi speech.
 
<p>The White House showcased Allawi's visit to the United
States as evidence of progress in Iraq that bolstered Bush's
optimistic outlook for the country in the face of escalating
insurgent violence.
 
<p>Allawi assured a joint session of Congress on Sept. 23 that
Iraq would successfully hold elections in January and appeared
alongside Bush in the White House Rose Garden where he blamed
the news media for negative perceptions about his country.
 
<p>But many of his remarks on Iraq employed the same themes,
and sometimes the same terms, as statements by Bush and other
administration officials.
 
<p>On Thursday, the Post quoted unnamed administration
officials as saying Allawi had been coached and aided by the
U.S. government, its allies and friends of the administration.
 
<p>It specifically cited former Coalition Provisional
Authority spokesman Dan Senor for sending Allawi recommended
phrases and helping him rehearse. The newspaper said Senor
represents the Bush campaign in media appearances.
 
<p>Senor could not be reached for comment.
 
<p>But Bush-Cheney spokesman Scott Stanzel said Senor did not
work for the campaign, though he acknowledged that campaign
staff direct media outlets to Senor for interviews.
 
<p>"He's not a campaign spokesman, a consultant or a staff
member," Stanzel said. "He's someone who speaks out on behalf
of the president's policies. He's someone who supports the
president's reelection."
 
<p>The Post said Allawi's speech was part of a larger
administration effort to battle negative perceptions about
Iraq. The effort also involves the Pentagon and the U.S. Agency
for International Development, it said.<P align="center">&copy; 2004 Reuters Ltd
