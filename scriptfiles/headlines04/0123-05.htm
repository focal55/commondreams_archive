<p> Former Gov. Christie Whitman was cut out of the decision-making process when President Bush bluntly rejected her efforts as U.S. Environmental Protection Agency director to reach a compromise that would allow the United States to be part of the Global Warming Treaty.</P>
<P> In a new book detailing former U.S. Treasurer Paul O'Neill's internal battles with the Bush administration, Whitman is described as a Republican moderate who fought a losing battle on global warming because the president relied on Vice President Dick Cheney and political adviser Karl Rove for advice.</P>

<!--/endimage/-->The book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743255453/commondreams-20" target="_new">The Price of Loyalty</a>," by Ron Suskind, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, has received much attention because it alleges Bush was determined to go to war with Iraq from the beginning of his administration and long before the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P> But Suskind also describes the problems he says Whitman and Secretary of State Colin Powell ran into when they opposed Bush's hard-line conservative advisers headed by Cheney and Rove.</P>
<P> According to Suskind, Whitman had difficulty finding out what the president was thinking on global warming policies before he announced he would not sign the international pact known as the Kyoto treaty. </P>
<P> When Whitman, according to Suskind, finally got a meeting with the president that she hoped would result in a compromise, Bush listened to her briefly and then cut her off, declaring, "Christie, I've made my decision."</P>
<P> The meeting with the president was scheduled after the former New Jersey governor sent a memo to Bush telling him he had a "credibility" problem.</P>
<P> "Mr. President," the memo began, "this (global warming) issue is a credibility problem for the United States in the international community. It is also an issue that is resonating here at home. We need to be engaged."</P>
<P> Whitman could not be reached for comment about the book. Peter McDonough, who was a consultant for Whitman at the EPA, said the former governor was traveling outside the state.</P>
<P> O'Neill is quoted in the book as being baffled in the early days of the Bush administration when the president asked him, not Whitman, to come up with a global warming policy.</P>
<P> The former treasurer, who was fired by Bush, said he didn't know whether he was supposed to consult Whitman. O'Neill said Whitman appeared surprised when he distributed information about global warming at one of Bush's first Cabinet meetings.</P>
<P> McDonough questioned the conclusion of the book and asserted that when he worked with Whitman in Washington, she had plenty of access to the president. "All she had to do was pick up the phone," McDonough said. "I don't mean that she was telephoning him all the time, but when she wanted to, she could reach him."</P>
<P> McDonough also said he was concerned about the number of errors in the book, including one in which Whitman's husband, John, was described as the son of a former New Jersey governor. John Whitman is the grandson of a former New York governor.</P>
<P> Suskind's book makes it clear that O'Neill was the major source of information about the inner workings of the Bush administration. The book, however, does include memos and other documentation. In fact, the Bush administration is investigating the possibility that some of the memos used by O'Neill and included in the book are classified documents.</P>
<P> Whitman left the governor's office in 2000, a year before her second term ended, and was EPA director for more than two years.</P>
<P> During her stay in Washington, there was considerable media speculation that Whitman was being overruled by conservatives both within the Bush administration and the EPA.</P>
<P> At one point, Suskind writes, Whitman relied on Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national security adviser and Whitman's personal friend, to try to find out what the president was thinking about the global warming issue.</P>
<P> Meanwhile, she was attending national and international meetings on global warming and insisting the president wanted to be part of the Kyoto treaty. </P>
<P> She pointed out then that the president, in his election campaign, had advocated regulation that would combat global warming by limiting the release of carbon dioxide pollutants into the atmosphere.</P>
<P> Before Bush announced his decision, Whitman tangled with Robert Novak, a conservative columnist who contested her assertions that Bush would reach some kind of agreement on global warming.</P>
<P> Whitman was said to have urged the president to go along with the treaty but to delay a decision on how the specifics of the treaty could be reached.</P>
<P> But the president rejected any compromise, saying the United States could not sign on to a treaty that did not include China and India. Bush argued that the danger of global warming could be eased by increasing the use of natural gas.</P>
<P> In recent writings and statements, Whitman has asserted that some hard-line environmentalists have made it difficult to reach practical solutions to complex problems. </P>
