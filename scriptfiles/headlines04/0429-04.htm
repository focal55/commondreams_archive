BAGHDAD - Ten U.S. soldiers were killed in  attacks around Baghdad on Thursday, eight of them in an  apparent suicide car bombing just south of the capital, the  U.S. military said.
<p> 
			
			The deaths took to 534 the number of U.S. soldiers killed  in action since U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq 13 months ago.  About 125 of them have been killed in April, the bloodiest  month for U.S. forces in Iraq since the invasion.<p> 
			
			The car bomb went off just south of Baghdad near Mahmudia  at about 11:30 a.m., the U.S. military said in a statement.<p> 
			
			"A driver in a station wagon approached the task force.  Once he was close enough to inflict injury he detonated the  explosive device," it said a statement, which did not make  clear whether the driver was in the vehicle when it exploded.<p> 
			
			The soldiers, who were searching for roadside bombs which  are a favorite insurgent weapon, were all from the 1st Armored  Division and the wounded were flown to a Baghdad military  hospital by helicopter, it said.<p> 
			
			Shortly before dawn, a U.S. soldier was killed in a  rocket-propelled grenade attack in eastern Baghdad, a separate  statement said.<p> 
			
			At around 10 a.m., a roadside bomb killed a U.S. soldier  and wounded another in the town of Baquba, 40 miles north of  Baghdad. Iraqi police said an Iraqi civilian was also killed in  the attack.<p> 
			
			With just weeks to go before the United States hands over  sovereignty to Iraqis on June 30, U.S.-led forces face a  growing insurgency.<p> 
			
			New polls showed Iraqi civilian deaths combined with heavy  U.S. losses this month have eroded support for President Bush's  war plan both among Iraqis and among the Americans who will  vote on his re-election in November.
