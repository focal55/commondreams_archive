<p>NEW YORK  -  Former President Bill Clinton has checked into a New York hospital and will undergo heart bypass surgery, U.S. networks reported on Friday. 
<p>ABC and CBS television reported that Clinton, 58, had checked into New York Presbyterian Hospital for quadruple heart bypass surgery. 

<p>A Democratic Party official told Reuters that Clinton had checked into the hospital with "chest pains." The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not confirm that Clinton would undergo bypass surgery. 

<p>CNN quoted a source close to the former president as saying the surgery could take place as early as Saturday. 

<p>Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, promised at the Democratic convention in July to be a "foot soldier" in John Kerry's race against Republican President Bush.
