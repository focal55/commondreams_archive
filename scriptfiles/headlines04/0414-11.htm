"We don't belong there. We're never going to win this war," said Sue Niederer. Her 24-year-old son, Seth, was killed two months ago while defusing a bomb south of Baghdad. 

<p>"It's time for us to get out," she said. 

<p>After a news conference, the families and veterans joined about 40 supporters in a march to the White House a few blocks away where they laid pink, white and yellow carnations in memory of the more than 670 American troops killed since the war began last year. 

<p>They also placed rose petals for the thousands of Iraqis who have died. 

<p>The march was organized by the group, <a href="http://www.mfso.org/" target="_new">Military Families Speak Out</a>, and <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" target="_new">United for Peace and Justice</a>, an anti-war coalition. 

<p>Michael Hoffman, a Marine who spent two months in Iraq fighting a war he opposed, said the country has deteriorated into chaos. "We are not making a better world for the Iraqis," he said. 

<p>Anas Shallal, an Iraqi-American, rejected suggestions that Iraq would spiral into further violence if U.S troops withdrew. 

<p>"It's really rather offensive to the Iraqi people to think they cannot govern themselves," said Shallal. "There's a lot of civil structures in Iraq right now, a lot of unions, a lot of organizations where people on the ground are taking leadership roles. I think we need to act as facilitators and take a back seat to this process so that the Iraqi people govern themselves."
