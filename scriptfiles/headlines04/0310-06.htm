<p>UNITED NATIONS  - The United States is more  concerned about its image than the law in its handling of  terror suspects held at its naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,  a lawyer for the detainees said on Wednesday.
<p> 
			
			As the U.S. Supreme Court nears an April 20 hearing on a  lawsuit challenging the detention of 16 of the Guantanamo  prisoners, Washington is suddenly scrambling to send a message  to the court that "we are doing something, trust us," said  Michael Ratner, president of the New York-based <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/" target="_new">Center for  Constitutional Rights</a>.
<p> 
			
			Following the high court's surprise decision last November  to review the case, Washington has granted minimal rights to  some of the detainees and has pledged to release dozens of  them, Ratner told a news conference at U.N. headquarters.<p> 
			
			Two of the five Britons freed on Tuesday were among the 16  the center is representing in its suit, Ratner said.<p> 
			
			Since November, "they have freed a number of people," he  said. "Shortly after we got the review, they said, 'We plan to  release approximately 140 people."'<p> 
			
			The United States is holding about 640 individuals from 44  different countries at Guantanamo Bay, caught in what  Washington calls the global war on terrorism.<p> 
			
			Human rights groups criticize the United States for holding  the prisoners, some for more than two years, without charges or  legal representation and without access to their families.<p> 
			
			The lawsuit seeks to have the detainees released and sent  home to either be charged or freed. Washington says they are  foreign combatants to whom U.S. laws and legal protections do  not apply. The Guantanamo base is not on U.S. soil.<p> 
			
			Ratner said it appeared Washington was choosing which  detainees to free at least partly on the basis of whether their  home country had supported the U.S.-led war on Iraq.<p> 
			
			Five suspects from Britain -- Washington's closest ally in  the invasion -- had been freed but none from France, which  opposed the Iraq war, he said.<p> 
			
			"It demonstrates to me the arbitrariness of the whole  system," Ratner said.<p> 
			
			"You have a completely unlawful prison camp and you have  those countries that are close to the United States getting  some of their detainees out.<p> 
			
			"But the French, because of their position on the Iraq war,  apparently have gotten nobody out yet."<p>
