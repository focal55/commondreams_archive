SIOUX FALLS - Democrat Stephanie Herseth won an  open U.S. House of Representatives seat in South Dakota on  Tuesday, scoring a narrow victory in a contest her party hopes  will help energize its drive to retake the  Republican-controlled chamber in November.
<p> 

			

			With 777 of the state's 798 precincts reporting, she had a  lead of 3,687 votes over Republican Larry Diedrich, out of more  than a quarter million ballots cast Tuesday for the state's  lone House seat.<p> 

			

			Herseth's victory didn't become apparent until early  Wednesday. It marked the second time in as many years the state  produced a cliff-hanger election -- in 2002, Democratic Sen.  Tim Johnson was re-elected by a 524-vote margin.<p> 

			

			The win was the second House pickup for the Democrats this  year and was the last House contest scheduled before November's  general election, when all 435 seats along with the presidency  and a third of the U.S. Senate are up.<p> 

			

			In February, Democratic Rep. Ben Chandler won a special  election for an open Kentucky seat.<p> 

			

			Tuesday's contest was for the balance of the term of  Republican Rep. Bill Janklow, who resigned in January following  a vehicular manslaughter conviction.<p> 

			

			Her win means that Republicans control the House with 228  seats to the Democrats' 206, with one independent. That still  leaves Democrats with an uphill fight to capture control as the  Republicans did in 1994's off-year election revolt led by  ideologist Newt Gingrich.<p> 

			

			RECENT POLLS<p> 

			

			Recent national polls show voters favoring Democrats over  Republicans for Congress generally but such results do not  necessarily reflect support for actual candidates.<p> 

			

			While the November election is likely to turn on local  issues rather than on larger questions such as President Bush's  Iraq policy, Democrats had said in advance that a Herseth  victory would give them a momentum in their campaign to regain  House control.<p> 

			

			What kind of bragging rights her win will now yield given  the tightness of the contest was uncertain, although South  Dakota does have about 48,000 more registered Republicans than  Democrats.<p> 

			

			Herseth, 33, granddaughter of a former governor and  daughter of a state lawmaker, and Diedrich, 46, a farmer and  former state senator, will undoubtedly face each other again in  November for a full two-year House term.<p> 

			

			Campaign issues in the South Dakota contest included  Herseth's call for further changes in the Medicare old-age  health system and Diedrich's opposition to tax increases.<p> 

			

			Diedrich has also opposed abortion, while Herseth supported  some abortion rights.
<p> 

			

			An official canvass of votes to insure the count was  compiled correctly is required under state law, after which the  loser could request a recount.
