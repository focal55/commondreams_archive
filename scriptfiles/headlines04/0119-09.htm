</table><!--/endimage/-->But voters stung national frontrunner, former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who has run an upstart campaign fuelled by fierce opposition to the Iraq war.<p>"We're determined to win," a defiant Dean said.</p><p>"If you told me a year ago I would finish third in Iowa, I would have been delighted. It's been a tough campaign. We've taken a lot of punches."</p><p>Kerry garnered 37.7 percent of the vote with 1,725 of 1,993 precincts reporting. Edwards, a millionare trial lawyer and North Carolina senator, had 32 percent.</p><p>Dean licked his wounds with just 17.9 percent, while veteran political warrior Dick Gephardt was left with just 10.6 percent.</p><p>The four leading candidates were all seeking to seize the momentum ahead of primary elections in New Hampshire on January 27 and 10 other states on March 2.</p><p>Wesley Clark, the retired four-star general, and Joseph Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate in the 2000 presidential election, gambled by not contesting the midwest state.</p><p>Clark noted Kerry's win, but said he was unfazed by his strong showing.</p><p>"With all due respect, he's a lieutenant and I'm a general," Clark told CNN.</p><p>"I've done all of the big leadership. I respect John Kerry and like him, but what I'm going to say is it's up to the voters ... all across this country."</p><p>A record tally of more than 100,000 Democrats was expected in a state seen as an electoral talisman since political unknown Jimmy Carter pulled off a shock win on the road to the White House in 1976.</p><p>Sixty-year-old Kerry, stormed into the caucuses with a slight edge in opinion polls after a lacklustre start to his campaign -- his failing voice testimony to long hours wooing voters.</p><p>Iowa's secretary of state, Chet Culver, said record numbers of people had pre-registered for the caucuses.</p><p>"The voter registration is literally off the chart. We have just looked at the numbers. We have over 95 percent of eligible Iowans actually registered to vote. That's the highest level in the history of our state."</p><p>Democratic Party officials say the record registration owes to the large number of contenders and antipathy to Bush's Republican administration.</p><p>Though there is still widespread support for the Iraq war, Democrats have been encouraged by a new drop in Bush's poll support.</p><p>"I think it's important to get a Democrat into office. I don't want another four years of Bush," said Joyce Shackleford, singling out the government's environmental policy and the Iraq war for particular censure.</p><p>Bush will grab back the spotlight on Tuesday, with his annual State of the Union address to Congress, expected to include a defense of his war on Iraq, and a sheaf of election-year domestic initiatives.</p><p>Kerry and Edwards hit traditional Democratic themes of health, education and empowering working Americans, but Kerry has also has focused on foreign policy.</p><p>Attacking Bush for his "arrogant, inept and reckless," foreign policy, he has said he will work to repair ties with America's allies and internationalise Iraq's reconstruction.</p><p>"Just because the United States of America is the big house on the block, doesn't mean we shouldn't be a good neighbour," Kerry said in a campaign speech Sunday, flanked by Senator Edward Kennedy.</p><p>Other candidates in Iowa are outsiders Reverend Al Sharpton, the outspoken civil rights activist, and Representative Dennis Kucinich, running on an unabashedly liberal platform.</p><p>Bush's State of the Union speech on Tuesday will be last annual policy address of his four-year term.</p><p>A New York Times/CBS poll out Sunday said given a choice between Bush and an unspecified Democratic candidate, 43 percent would vote for Bush and 45 percent would vote for the Democrat.</p><p>Bush's overall approval rating fell to 50 percent from 58 percent in December.</p><p>The caucuses and primaries held in the 50 states will choose 4,315 delegates who will select the Democratic Party's presidential contender at a national convention on July 26-29 in Boston.</p><p>
