<p>The United States is facing increasing international pressure to place limitations on the use of military sonar, the underwater equivalent of radar that has been linked to mass strandings of whales.

<P>The European Union Parliament -- the most prominent of four international bodies that have taken up the matter in recent months -- called in October for its member states to develop a moratorium on all types of military sonars, which use powerful sound to locate objects such as submarines.

<P>Two weeks ago, the IUCN-World Conservation Union, a prestigious group of 70 nations and 400 nongovernmental organizations meeting in Bangkok, overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging governments to limit the use of loud noise sources in the world's oceans, including military sonar, oil and gas exploration and commercial shipping, until the effects are better understood. The United States abstained from the vote.

<P>The measure also said that, to the extent possible, sonar and other activities should be avoided entirely in areas where the vulnerable species live. According to studies cited by the EU and the other world bodies, noise can interfere with the survival of the ocean creatures that depend on sound to navigate, find food, locate mates, avoid predators and communicate with one another. At high decibel levels, noise can kill.

<P>The U.S. Navy is the biggest user of midfrequency active sonar in the world -- and government officials have been loath to require permits to regulate its use.

<P>"We're not ignoring it by any means," said Bill Hogarth, director of the fisheries division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). "But to translate to direct mortality is very difficult.''

<P>Hogarth said that calling for a ban or restrictions on naval sonar is "too simple,'' because the effects of sonar depend on ocean conditions.

<P>In more than a dozen instances dating back to the 1960s, however, whales have stranded themselves on the beaches and sometimes died at the time of naval training exercises miles away using midfrequency active sonar.

<P>An unprecedented stranding of 16 beaked and minke whales in the Bahamas in 2000 brought worldwide attention to military sonar. A NOAA investigation concluded that a Navy testing maneuver using midfrequency sonar -- by far the most commonly used type of sonar -- was the likely cause. Necropsies found signs of brain hemorrhaging, which is consistent with injury from sound.

<P>Kenneth Balcomb, founder of the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Wash., and leader of the Bahamas Marine Mammal Survey, concluded that a vibration in the whales' cranial air spaces tore delicate tissues around the brain and ears.

<P>Military active sonars emit sound waves -- blasted from loud speakers - - that scan hundreds of thousands of square miles of ocean waters the way a spotlight would search on land. The sound signal bounces off objects and sends back information to receivers. Some midfrequency active sonar systems can put out more than 235 decibels, as loud as a Saturn V rocket at launch. Aside from the U.S. use, the technology is also employed by Western European countries, Japan, Australia and, to a small extent, Canada.

<P>The other two groups that have called for curbs on naval sonar in the last five months are the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission and the 16 member nations of the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area, or
<P>ACCOMBAMS.

<P>At the Bangkok meeting, the United States chose not to engage in the discussions on underwater sea noise, and abstained from voting on the resulting resolution, according to the State Department.

<P>U.S. officials later issued a statement saying the United States shares underlying concerns about the potential effects of sonar, encourages an international approach to advance scientific understanding and is a leader in paying for research and conducting programs to assess and mitigate the adverse effects of some sounds.

<P>Darla Jordan, a State Department press officer, said the United States abstained because it is "in the process of addressing these complex issues.''

<P>Those close to the discussions said there are differences on sonar policy between NOAA, the Defense Department and the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission.

<P>Disappointed by the abstention, environmental groups said the United States, by refusing to partake in negotiations, was repeating behavior exhibited in regard to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The Bush administration walked away from the talks on how to implement the United Nations' convention to curb greenhouse gases, which has now been signed by 197 countries and takes effect in February 2005.

<P>Erin Heskett, an International Fund for Animal Welfare spokesman, said the United States should have been a leader in forging the Kyoto pact and it should be collaborating now with Europe and other nations on the sonar issue.

<P>"Here the U.S. is once again ignoring an opportunity to work with the international community," Heskett said. "You would think with the resources and the scientific expertise that we have that we'd be a leader in finding solutions. Not making a commitment to work with other countries, that's the most disturbing.''

<P>Last July, four environmental groups, including the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Natural Resources Defense Council, sent a letter to the Navy, asking it to change the way it uses midfrequency sonar on more than half of its 300 ships and submarines. The Navy has not made public what it has done in response.

<P>Joel Reynolds, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, who first challenged the Navy's use of powerful underwater sounds a decade ago, says his group is considering filing a lawsuit that would charge the Navy with harassing and killing marine mammals in violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

<P>NOAA officials say the Navy has approached the agency about obtaining permits to conduct midfrequency sonar exercises off the East Coast of the United States. But Navy spokesman Mike Kafka -- asked if the Navy is talking with NOAA about putting midfrequency sonar under permit -- said, "It would be inappropriate to get into specifics of ongoing talks.

<P>"All policy decisions on this matter, including those regarding permitting requirements, must be based on fully developed, sound science,'' Kafka said, adding, "the Navy's continued ability to test and train with anti- submarine technology, including midrange sonar, is absolutely vital to the nation's security and national interests.''

<P>Hogarth, the NOAA fisheries director, said his agency is in constant dialogue with the Navy.

<P>"We realize the Navy is a big user of sonar," Hogarth said. "We're aware of the national security issues, and we're also aware of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.'' <p align="center">&copy;2004 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
