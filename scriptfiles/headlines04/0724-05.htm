<p>Members of the commission investigating the September 11 terror attacks have injected a potentially unsettling element into President George Bush's re-election campaign by deciding not to disband. <P>Although the bipartisan commission scrupulously avoided apportioning blame to either the Clinton or Bush administrations, the decision ensures that 9/11 and Iraq will remain at the forefront of the election campaign.  <P>The commission's 10 members said they planned to team up in pairs - one Democrat and one Republican - to campaign throughout the US for the adoption of their 41 recommendations to make the country safer.  <P>"All 10 of us have decided to do everything we can, whether it's testimony or lobbying or speaking or whatever's necessary, to let the American people know about these recommendations - know how important they are, our belief that they can save lives," Thomas Kean, the commission's chair, told reporters on Thursday.  <P>Jamie Gorelick, who served in the Clinton administration, made the point even plainer. "Everyone who is running for office can be asked: Do you support these recommendations?"  <P>The strategy would mark the start of a new chapter in the life of a commission which has grown in credibility over the last 20 months. It has also accumulated moral force, thanks in large measure to the support of victims' families. Advocates for the families said they would also press for the adoption of the commission's recommendations.  <P>That could prove an embarrassment to the Bush administration, whose officials have responded cautiously to the commission's call for a sweeping overhaul of the intelligence services.  <P>The Democratic challenger, John Kerry, embraced the recommendations and said he would convene an emergency summit on security if he is elected in November.  <P>The contrast could spell trouble for Mr Bush, who has made his handling of terrorism the centerpiece of his campaign and has insisted that he fully understood the threat.  
<P>"This is going to underscore the sense that we really have not been prepared. Everyone on the commission seems to say that we are safer, but not safe," said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster.  <P>A poll by Mr Hart and a Republican pollster in the Wall Street Journal yesterday suggested that the Republicans' traditional supremacy on national security issues has fallen sharply. Only 8% had confidence in the Republican administration's handling of Iraq, down from 27% last January.  <P>The Bush administration's immediate response to the commission's call for sweeping changes to the government's intelligence agencies was cool.  <P>"People should recognize that we're talking about pretty fundamental changes here," the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told reporters. "It only makes sense to try and understand the implications of them before you rush headlong one way."  <P>Mr Kerry has already endorsed one of the commission's central suggestions - the creation of an intelligence tsar - an idea that met little enthusiasm from the White House when it first surfaced.  <P>However, Mr Kerry's attempts to put himself on the side of the commission were pounced on almost immediately by the Bush re-election campaign, accusing the Democratic challenger of attempting to politicize the commission report.
