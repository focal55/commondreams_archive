NEW YORK -- For many opponents of the US occupation of Iraq, the abuses of Iraqi prisoners are symptomatic of what they believe is a wider crime that is not being investigated: the United States' violation of the international laws of war when it invaded and occupied Iraq last year.</p>
<p>In an effort to augment the public record of the conflict and challenge arguments that the war was legally justified, more than 50 grass-roots organizations from around the world yesterday helped sponsor the nation's first mock tribunal on the war.</p>
<p>''We can't leave the task of writing history only to the victors,&quot; said Basak Ertur, an activist from Turkey who helped organize the worldwide antiwar protests that drew millions in February 2003.</p>
<p>''From the get-go, there wasn't the kind of support the Bush administration would have liked,&quot; said Liz Roberts, one of the organizers of the forum, one in a series taking place in several countries called the <a href="http://www.worldtribunal-nyc.org/" target="_new">World Tribunal on Iraq</a>. ''People are looking for places where they can become informed, and I think we have reached the point&quot; where the public wants additional scrutiny of the US Iraq policy, she said.</p>
<p>Organizers say the effort is modeled on the tribunal organized by writer Bertrand Russell in 1967 to investigate alleged war crimes in Vietnam. The venue chosen for yesterday's forum was the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, in part because it is where Abraham Lincoln gave a lecture on slavery in February 1860, nine months before he was elected president.</p>
<p>The Bush administration believes that Iraq's failure to comply with United Nations resolutions outlawing its weapons of mass destruction programs, passed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, was cause for military action. US officials contend that the growing threat from nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons justified a war to preempt the danger potentially posed by Iraq.</p>
<p>But at yesterday's forum, Peter Weiss, vice president of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms, cited the UN Charter in maintaining that the war was illegal.</p>
<p>The UN charter states that military action must be approved by the world body unless one of its members is invaded, Weiss pointed out. He said that in his legal opinion, UN Security Council Resolution 1441 -- passed in November 2002 and calling on Iraq to declare its weapons programs or face ''serious consequences&quot; -- was not sufficient approval.</p>
<p>The UN principles on war were ''not drafted by woolly-eyed pacifists, but some of the world's leading statesmen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If the existence of weapons of mass destruction was solidly proven before the war, the conflict could be interpreted as legally justifiable, Weiss said, but no weapons have been found, nor was sufficient prewar evidence presented.</p>
<p>Michael Hoffman, who as a lance corporal in the US Marine Corps participated in the initial invasion, testified on what he said was the ''unlawful killing and detention of civilians.&quot;</p>
<p>The mock tribunals have also been held in Germany, India, Indonesia, and Denmark, and others are planned for later this year in Japan and Belgium.</p>
