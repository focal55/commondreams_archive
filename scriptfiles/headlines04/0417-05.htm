<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; 
Suite 300 is deceptively quiet. Office workers sit at their 
computers in cluttered cubicles, the only sounds the tap-tap-tap on the 
keyboards, the endless chirp of the telephones and the low hum of 
conversations.
<P>But the numbers tell the real story.
<P>The workers in these four cramped rooms in a downtown office building get 
an average 1,000 e-mails a week and run <a href="http://www.marchforwomen.org/" target="_new">a Web site</a> that earlier this month 
logged 1 million hits in one day. They've ordered 700,000 purple and gold 
stickers and 800,000 palm-size leaflets. Some are trying to recruit more than 
6,000 volunteers, while others are coordinating hundreds of delegations coming 
here from across the United States.
<P>The goal, Alice Cohan explained this week, is to assemble a crowd on the 
National Mall that is "too big to ignore." The cause: women's abortion rights, 
which activists say are threatened as never before.
<P>Cohan, 53, is at the center of a major local and national organizing 
drive for the <a href="http://www.marchforwomen.org/" target="_new">March for Women's Lives</a>, the abortion rights demonstration that 
activists say will attract hundreds of thousands to Washington on April 25. 
The march is the movement's first major rally here in 12 years.
<P>Seven national women's and civil rights groups joined forces to 
coordinate the march  --  the first time a coalition has put its 
organizational muscle behind the event, led in the past primarily by the 
National Organization for Women. This time, organizing and funding are being 
shared by NOW, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Black Women's Health 
Imperative, the Feminist Majority, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the National 
Latina Institute for Reproductive Health and the Planned Parenthood Federation 
of America.
<P>Some lead coordinators say they expect to match or exceed the turnout of 
the last major abortion rights march in Washington, an April 1992 
demonstration that they say drew 750,000. Even by the more conservative police 
estimate of half a million, that march remains one of the largest 
demonstrations ever held in the nation's capital.
<P>"We plan for this march to be historic in both size and scope," said Kate 
Michelman, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.
<P>Michelman and other organizers said a sense of urgency is fueling the 
wide appeal of the march. This month, President Bush signed legislation making 
it a crime to kill or injure a fetus during the commission of a federal 
offense. In November, he signed into law a prohibition on a late-term 
procedure that opponents call "partial birth" abortion. Both laws, combined 
with other recent victories by anti-abortion forces, have alarmed movement 
leaders, who view them as part of a conservative strategy to erode Roe vs. 
Wade, the Supreme Court decision that established a woman's constitutional 
right to an abortion.
<P>"We all feel that we're at a turning point," said Eleanor Smeal, 64, 
president of the Feminist Majority and former president of NOW. "As leaders, 
it's our responsibility to tell people how dire the situation is."
<P>The march falls on the same weekend as protests surrounding the spring 
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and a contingent 
of globalization protesters will join the women's march.
<P>Anti-abortion forces will be there, too. One campaign, called Operation 
Witness, led by activist Randall Terry, plans to line the march route with at 
least 1,200 to 1,500 supporters. "They are going to have to pass through an 
ocean of pro-life signs and banners," said Terry, who said his group's 
presence would be peaceful.</p>
