<p>WASHINGTON  --The Bush administration has bungled the war on terrorism, doing 
little to provide security at home while breeding legions of new enemies 
abroad, the government's former anti-terrorism chief, Richard Clarke, told a 
large Berkeley audience Tuesday night.
<P>Clarke, who made international headlines last spring when he emerged as 
the highest-ranking whistle-blower from inside the White House's war on 
terrorism, painted an alarming picture of a White House still pursuing a 
losing strategy while America's safety hangs in the balance.
<P>"The pool of people who really hate us is so much greater than it was on 
9/11 because of this needless and counterproductive war in Iraq," Clarke said 
to applause from nearly 2,000 people at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach auditorium. 
<P>On the home front, except for improved airline safety, little or nothing 
has been done to protect the many other vulnerable targets such as trains, 
chemical plants, Wal-Marts and financial headquarters, said Clarke, who served 
as counterterrorism czar under both Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
<P>Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, he and other counterterrorism 
officials urged a wide range of protective actions, such as security for 
commuter trains vulnerable to the type of backpack bombs that later blew up a 
train in Madrid.
<P>"That could happen in the BART system today," he said. He described most 
homeland-security measures in the past three years as "token efforts."
<P>He also called the war on terrorism a misnomer. 
<P>"We're not engaged in a war on terrorism, a war against a tactic," he 
said. "We're not concerned here with all terrorist groups." There are many 
terrorist organizations around the world that the U.S. government is not 
actively fighting, he noted.
<P>The enemy, he said, consists of about 100,000 members of about 14 
jihadist groups, loosely linked to al Qaeda and representing "a virulent 
strain of Islam." This strain, he said, is a violence-embracing form of the 
Sunni fundamentalist movement known as Wahabism.
<P>America needs to confront such enemies directly, but it also needs to 
wage a "war of ideas" with the hundreds of millions of Muslims who currently 
support the hardcore fanatics, he said.
<P>Clarke was a senior White House adviser to the last three presidents and 
was the government's "foremost expert on al Qaeda," in the words of U.S. Court 
of Appeals Judge Richard Posner writing in the New York Times last week. 
<P>Clark's bombshell book earlier this year, "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743260244/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Against All Enemies: Inside 
America's War on Terror</a></i>," became a No. 1 New York Times best-seller. The book 
says the Bush team failed to give sufficient attention to the al Qaeda threat 
both before and after Sept. 11, focusing instead on a preoccupation with 
Saddam Hussein and invading Iraq.
<P>Clarke, who left the White House in frustration in February 2003, issued 
high-profile criticisms as a star witness before the national Sept. 11 
commission and on CBS News' "60 Minutes," both in March this year.
<P>He had been dissatisfied before he left. In what Clarke viewed as a sign 
of the Bush administration downgrading counterterrorism, for example, national 
security adviser Condoleezza Rice told him that he could stop attending the 
"principals" meetings of the National Security Council.
<P>His book provoked strong reactions from the White House, with Vice 
President Dick Cheney saying Clarke hadn't been "in the loop," and others 
suggested he resented working for Rice.
<P>Hoping to avert another Vietnam, he began a career in Washington in 1973, 
working for the Pentagon for five years before joining the State Department. 
He worked on security in the Reagan administration and, as assistant secretary 
of state for politico-military affairs under President George H.W. Bush, he 
coordinated international support for the Persian Gulf War.
<P>Clarke's appearance at Berkeley was sponsored by UC Berkeley's Goldman 
School of Public Policy, the campus Institute of International Studies and the 
chancellor's office.
<P>He was interviewed on stage by Michael Nacht, dean of the Goldman School, 
and Steven Weber, director of the Institute of International Studies.
