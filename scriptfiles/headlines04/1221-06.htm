<p>SYDNEY - Australia has distanced itself from the United States' hardline attempts to stall international action on greenhouse gas emissions, a report said.




<P>It followed intense lobbying by the United States at a climate change conference in Buenos Aires earlier this month to set the stage for the Kyoto agreement, which Washington opposes.

<P>The two countries are the only major developed nations that have not signed the Kyoto protocol, which is due to enter into force in February.

<P>In comments reported Monday by The Sydney Morning Herald, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said that although Canberra had not signed Kyoto it would, however, be prepared to enter a future agreement.

<P>He described the difference between the two countries' stances as "subtle".

<P>"The difference between the US and Australia is that we are prepared to engage in a new agreement as long as it is comprehensive," Campbell said from London.

<P>"But a new agreement will have to include the US and the developing world," he added.

<P>"If we don't do that the world is in serious jeopardy."

<P>yoto is due to take effect in February 2005, running until 2012. Talks for the follow-on treaty start next year.

<P>Although it has not signed on to Kyoto, Australia has set its own voluntary goals for greenhouse gas emissions which the government says are on track and will exceed the targets set out in the Kyoto agreement.
