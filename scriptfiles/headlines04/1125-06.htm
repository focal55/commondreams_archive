<p>WASHINGTON - The United States has failed to explain its diplomatic and military actions adequately to the Muslim world, according to a high level report by a Pentagon (<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://news.search.yahoo.com/search/news?fr=news-storylinks&p=%22Pentagon%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw">news</a> - <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=web-storylinks&p=Pentagon">web sites</a>) advisory board that has been made public.

  <p>

 


"America's negative image in world opinion and diminished ability to persuade are consequences of factors other than the failure to implement communications strategies," the report by the Defense Science Board said.
 <p>
 

"Succeeding in this struggle requires leadership from the President on down," it stressed.
 <p>
 

The report which was copied to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, was presented on September 23, but has just been released publicly.
 <p>
 

"Interests collide. Leadership counts. Policies matter. Mistakes dismay our friends and provide enemies with unintentional assistance. Strategic communication is not the problem, but it is a problem," it said.
 <p>
 

The 102-page report calls for a major overhaul in how the US government communicates its policies, including the creation of a "strategic communication structure" inside the White House's National Security Council.
 <p>
 

The report also said the US government had failed to adapt its Cold War communications strategy to deal with the threat of Islamic extremism.
 <p>
 

"In stark contrast to the Cold War, the United States today is not seeking to contain a threatening state empire, but rather seeking to convert a broad movement within Islamic civilization to accept the value structure of Western Modernity -- an agenda hidden within the official rubric of a 'war on terrorism,'" it said.
 <p>

 

"Today we reflexively compare Muslim 'masses' to those oppressed under Soviet rule.
 <p>
 

"This is a strategic mistake. There is no yearning-to-be-liberated-by-the-US groundswell among Muslim societies -- except to be liberated perhaps from what they see as apostate tyrannies that the US so determinedly promotes and defends."
