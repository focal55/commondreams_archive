<p>The top U.S. general for Latin America wants regional armies to help 
fight the war on terror  --  a strategy that some observers say could result 
in a return to widespread human rights abuses of past decades.

Last month, Gen. James Hill, head of the government agency most engaged 
with Latin America, the U.S. Southern Command, told a congressional panel that 
Washington "must take comprehensive measures in our region to combat 
international terrorism," which he said included strengthening Latin 
militaries. 
<P>Terrorists throughout Latin America "bomb, murder, kidnap, traffic drugs, 
transfer arms, launder money and smuggle humans," Hill told the House Armed 
Services Committee.
<P>He described the threats to the United States as twofold:
<P>-- "Traditional" terrorists, a category that includes drug traffickers, 
the 25,000 members of urban crime gangs in Central America, and guerrilla and 
paramilitary groups tied to drug trafficking in Colombia;
<P>-- "Emerging" terrorists  --  "radical populists" who tap into "deep-seated frustrations of the failure of democratic reforms to deliver expected 
goods and services." Hill's apparent reference is to Venezuelan President Hugo 
Chavez and Bolivian indigenous leader Evo Morales. 
<P>Hill also noted that "branches of Middle Eastern terrorist organizations 
conduct support activities in the Southern Command area of responsibility."
<P>To confront these threats, he told the legislators, the United States 
must "broaden military-to-military contacts" in combating terrorism. He has 
also said that when "legal boundaries don't make sense anymore given the 
current threat" (if armed forces are banned from cooperating with police and 
civilian intelligence agencies), Latin American countries should determine if 
such restrictions need revision. 
<P>Hill's broad-brushed approach alarms Harley Shaiken, chairman of UC 
Berkeley's Center for Latin American Studies. 
<P>"In the 20th century, all Latin American militaries had to do was call 
someone a communist, and that person became fair game," Shaiken said. With 
revitalized militaries, "terrorism could become the communism of the 21st 
century that puts someone under a death sentence."

More U.S. troops proposed
</b>
<P>A key element of Hill's proposal  --  and one sure to stir controversy in 
Congress  --  is to raise the U.S. "troop cap" in Colombia from 400 to 800 and 
from 400 American civilian contractors to 600 to help that nation's government 
win a 4-decade-old war against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN).
<P>In a telephone interview from Miami, Southern Command spokesman Raul 
Duany  said there are hundreds of terrorist incidents yearly  --  car bombings,
kidnappings, assassinations  --  by leftist and rightist armed groups, most 
of them in Colombia.
<P>He added that Arab immigrants in the tri-border area with Brazil, 
Argentina and Paraguay; Margarita Island in Venezuela; Iquique, Chile; and 
Maicao, Colombia, have sent funds to Islamic extremist groups such as 
Hezbollah and Hamas.
<P>Duany conceded that "there is no evidence of a direct connection to al 
Qaeda" in Latin America and added that Hill's statements reflected "more a 
long-term concern" in an area "ripe for international terrorists."
<P>The Southern Command is certainly influential when it comes to 
hemispheric policy.
<P>It has more people  --  1,470  --  dealing with Latin American matters 
than those at the departments of State, Commerce, Treasury and Agriculture, 
the Pentagon's Joint Staff, and the office of the secretary of defense 
combined. The command's $800 million annual budget covers 19 countries in 
Central and South America and 12 in the Caribbean. 
<P>Laurie Freeman, a security policy associate for the Washington Office on 
Latin America,  said Hill's remarks to Congress were made during the course of the budget approval process   and were intended to justify Southern 
Command's role. 
<P>"In the post-9/11 world, when the U.S. military defines itself in 
relation to the war on terror, Southcom is the odd man out," she said. 
<P>But with the Bush administration consumed with Iraq and Afghanistan, 
Hill's proposals to protect the U.S. southern flank from possible terrorism 
should be taken seriously,  said Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, a member 
of the House Armed Services Committee. 
<P>"This administration hasn't done much in our own backyard. You can't go 
on treating Latin America like a trivial part of our foreign policy," Tauscher 
said. "But I think Gen. Hill is right to raise the issue. Narco-terrorism like 
in Colombia can fuel networks like al Qaeda." 
<P>Tauscher agrees with Hill on increasing the troop cap in Colombia but  
said it would be a mistake to bolster regional armies. 
<P>"We already have significant military-to-military cooperation with 
Southern Command countries," she said. "And I don't think we should advocate 
changes in their legal framework that allows their militaries to be a more 
robust version of their police force."
<P>Miguel Diaz, who heads the South America Project for the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies in Washington D.C, also agrees with the 
thrust of Hill's argument.
<P>"If you put it all together  --  the lack of rule of law, dysfunctional 
judicial systems, corruption, the widespread circulation of arms, a culture of 
impunity and countries that have not been able to get a grip on the poverty 
problem," Diaz said, "there is a deteriorating security situation that lends 
itself to terrorist movements gaining a foothold in Latin America." 
<P><b>Poverty called greater threat
</b>
<P>But Freeman cautioned that the greatest threat to hemispheric security is 
not terrorism, but poverty, inequality and injustice. She  said endemic 
poverty draws Latin Americans to drugs, guerrilla groups, urban gangs and such 
populist politicians as Bolivia's Morales, who regularly leads protests 
against U.S. policies. 
<P>"Failure to distinguish popular unrest from legitimate terrorist threats 
hinders our government's ability to effectively combat terrorism," she said. 
<P>Indeed, Latin America has the world's most egregious inequalities in 
income distribution, with the richest 10 percent accounting for 35 percent of 
total earnings. Some 43 percent of the population lives below the poverty line,
and there are 20 million more poor in 2003 than there were in 1997, according 
to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. 
<P>Shaiken, too, hopes the administration eventually will reject Hill's plan 
to fortify regional armed forces. 
<P>"The notion that we should strengthen Latin American armies misses the 
role they played in human rights abuses in past decades and how Latin American 
governments have been trying to diminish their role ever since other than 

being just the army," he said. "In many countries, they were the terrorist 
organization, killing and disappearing thousands."
