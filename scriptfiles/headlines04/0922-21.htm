About 35 people met during their lunch hour to listen to speakers, rally and discuss their hope that debt cancellation for over 30 countries might be agreed upon at the G-7 Finance Minister meeting on Oct. 1 and World Bank and IMF meetings Oct. 2-3.
<p>Some carried posters stating "Debt Starvation" and chanted "medication for every nation, drop the debt now!"
<p>The group was cautiously optimistic that the debts, which it claims are illegitimate and illegal, might be completely canceled for many impoverished countries.
<p>The United States is pushing a plan for some debt elimination. Marie Clarke, National Coordinator of <a href="http://www.jubileeusa.org/" target="_new">Jubilee USA Network</a>, said that proposal is "a good start," but she urged supporters to continue their focus on the issue in case the debt cancellation was not agreed upon, or if the funds were saved by cutting aid to the countries.
<p>"It is very important that we reaffirm what we are really looking for and that is for 100 percent debt cancellation without harmful conditions for all of the impoverished nations of the global south so that we can really free up resources to fight the AIDS pandemic," Clarke said.
<p>The extensive protests that had marked IMF-World Bank meetings have been scaled down considerably since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The District of Columbia police department said no one was available Tuesday to discuss whether protest permits had been issued &#151; or requested &#151; for events coinciding with this fall's meeting.
<p>The group &#151; <a href="http://www.50years.org/" target="_new">50 Years is Enough Network</a> &#151; is planning a rally and an overnight vigil Oct. 1-2 to wait for the debt relief decision, said Njoki Njehu, the group's director.
<p>Much of the focus of Tuesday's rally was on the increasing crisis created by the spread of HIV  and AIDS and the lack of access to life-saving drugs.
<p>Salih Booker, executive director of <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/" target="_new">Africa Action</a>, said the World Bank and IMF focus on debt repayment rather than on health care for poor countries, even as the AIDS pandemic escalates.
<p>"Poor countries are in debt bondage - they're paying more to the World Bank and the IMF than they receive in new loans or in aid or in investment each year," Booker said.
<p>Organizers passed out a copy of a letter to President Bush , signed by 32 members of Congress, urging debt elimination. "It has been estimated that if heavily indebted poor governments could use funds spent on debt service for human development instead, at least 3 million more children would live beyond their 5th birthday," the letter stated.
<p>The letter added that debt in impoverished countries could impact America's national security, citing a connection between desperation and potential terrorism. "The poor and hungry are more easily enticed by terrorists, and those without hope have more reason to go to war."</p>
