<p>WASHINGTON -- Three weeks after announcing his presidential bid, Ralph Nader is running a campaign so elusive that it is almost impossible to find.</p>
  <p>
     Its phone number is unpublished. Its headquarters is tucked inside the offices of one of the candidate's nonprofit ventures in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood. Either Nader is running a stealth operation or his campaign has not raised enough money to operate in a  traditional manner.</p>
  <p>
     &quot;We're still getting off the ground,&quot; Kevin Zeese, a senior Nader campaign aide, said somewhat cautiously on Thursday, appearing startled to receive a visitor at Nader for President headquarters and refusing to give an impromptu tour.</p>
  <p>
     Whether Nader is plotting an under-the-radar surge or is struggling financially could make an enormous difference in the coming election, either helping the consumer advocate tip the scales in key states or rendering him a nonfactor. Recent polls indicate Nader would win 6 percent of the vote nationwide, and his advisers are mapping out ways around complex state ballot-access laws, especially in Florida. But will they even get that far?</p>
  <p>
     The first solid indication will come March 31, the deadline for first-quarter campaign finance filings with the Federal Election Commission. Contributions to Nader's campaign should indicate how much early support he has.</p>
  <p>
     The more crucial issue for Nader  is how much success he will have getting on ballots around the country for the Nov. 2 election. This is where organization and support in  states matter.</p>
  <p>
     At least one ballot specialist thinks Nader will not have a problem in this regard.</p>
  <p>
     &quot;Unless he completely collapses, I can't imagine him getting on fewer than 45&quot; states' ballots, said Richard Winger of the nonpartisan Ballot Access News publication. &quot;There's no theoretical problem with him getting on the ballot in every state. The question is, how many people are going to want to go out there and collect signatures for him?&quot;</p>
  <p>
     Democrats, many still bitter that Nader won more than 97,000 votes in Florida in 2000 while George W. Bush beat Al Gore by a mere 537 votes, are divided over how potent a force Nader will be this time. Eager to blunt his effect, Democrats are planning legal challenges in several competitive states to try to keep Nader off the ballot, and Senator John F. Kerry's campaign is deploying former Vermont governor Howard Dean to lure progressives, students, and Americans who shun mainstream politics away from the former Green Party nominee.</p>
  <p>
     Nader campaign officials say that despite the fierce opposition from the Democratic establishment, they are doing better than they were at this stage of the 2000 race, raising money at a faster clip and signing up at least 7,000 volunteers to help put their candidate on state ballots nationwide.</p>
  <p>
     Asked whether Nader would be an option for voters in all  states, Zeese said: &quot;I think we're going to do very close to that, if not make it. Funding is coming in faster this time than last time.&quot;</p>
  <p>
     Like other campaigns, the Nader camp is using the Internet for fund-raising. But if the money is pouring in as the Nader campaign says, it does not seem to be buying creature comforts for the campaign staff.</p>
  <p>
     Housed at the end of a dark corridor on the second floor of an unremarkable concrete office building, Nader central is so well hidden that workers in neighboring offices said they thought the suite was closed for renovation.</p>
  <p>
     The interior, somewhat cluttered and casual, offers little evidence of the kind of work done. There are no visible signs of a presidential campaign, either in or outside the suite. The office shares space with Citizen Works, a two-year-old Nader group that promotes progressive causes.</p>
  <p>
     As Zeese noted, Nader himself is the campaign, doling out information on the road and making himself accessible to media nationwide. The  headquarters is still in the works, Zeese added, given that Nader  announced his candidacy only last month. Nader's schedule indicates he is nothing if not confident. Over the next few days, he is focusing on states that are almost certain to vote Republican. He is scheduled to speak today in Austin and Crawford, Texas, then travel to Oklahoma City for a Sunday news conference, part of a broader mission to raise awareness about the difficulties candidates can face in states with tough ballot access.</p>
  <p>
     Besides those two states, Indiana, North Carolina, and Georgia are considered among the most complicated for an Independent -- requiring tens of thousands of signatures, in some cases, or notarized declarations from supporters, among other things.</p>
  <p>
     Still, it is notable that the five states to which Nader is least likely to win access  are all deeply Republican, while  battleground states where Nader could swing the results have looser rules, especially in the hands of a skilled activist.</p>
  <p>
     Without the backing of any party in Florida, for example, Nader would need 93,000 signatures to get on the ballot -- a bar so high that Democrats initially hoped he could be shut out of the race entirely. But according to Florida's rules, Nader needs only to represent a &quot;party&quot; to gain instant access to the ballot without any signatures, easily done by creating his own party by the deadline, Sept. 1, or joining forces with other established minority parties  established in the state.</p>
  <p>
     According to Zeese, Nader campaign officials are  studying all  options, although in a number of important states the requirements are minimal: 5,000 signatures in Ohio, 25 signatures in Tennessee, 1,000 signatures in Arkansas, and $500 in Louisiana, no signatures needed at all.</p>
  <p>
     &quot;We have seen some of the news reports, that Democrats will be challenging every signature&quot; on every ballot, Zeese said.</p>
  <p>
     But, he said, &quot;People who are supportive of Nader's campaign, a lot of them are experienced at this, have been involved in other parties such as the Reform and Green and Libertarian parties.&quot; He also noted that &quot;people who are active often do referendums and initiatives&quot; with similar obstacles before Election Day.</p>
  <p>
     It was in Florida that Democrats felt Nader robbed Gore of victory in 2000; the other state in which Bush won and Nader drew measurable support was New Hampshire, which requires just 3,000 signatures for a candidate to get on the ballot whether he or she runs with a party or alone.</p>
  <p>
     Nader could play the spoiler in either state in November if he gets even a fraction of the vote he garnered last time.</p>
