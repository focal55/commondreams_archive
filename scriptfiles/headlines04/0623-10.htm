<p>WASHINGTON - President Bush said he has never  ordered the torture of Iraqi or al Qaeda prisoners as the White  House on Tuesday released secret documents showing the use of  dogs to induce fear was approved among interrogation methods at  Guantanamo Bay and then abandoned.
<p> 
			
The White House release of a thick file of newly  declassified papers tried to demonstrate that Bush and his top  aides, in setting policy on interrogation methods, insisted  that detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, be treated humanely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <p> 
			
			"Let me make very clear the position of my government and  our country: We do not condone torture. I have never ordered  torture. I will never order torture. The values of this country  are such that torture is not a part of our soul and our being,"  Bush told reporters at the White House.<p> 
			
			But Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont accused the  White House of releasing a "self-serving selection" of  documents. "The stonewalling in the prison abuse scandal has  been building to a crisis point," he said.<p> 
			
			The documents showed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in  December 2002 approved harsh interrogation techniques for  Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners at the U.S. Naval Base in  Guantanamo, only to rescind many of those weeks later and  approve less aggressive techniques in April of 2003.<p> 
			
			Treatment of the Guantanamo detainees, including  interrogation methods, has come under scrutiny following a  scandal over abuse and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners by  U.S. forces at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.<p> 
			
			Rumsfeld originally approved aggressive interrogation  tactics at Guantanamo Bay after military leaders there  complained in a memo that "current guidelines for interrogation  procedures at GTMO limit the ability of interrogators to  counter advanced resistance."<p> 
			
			The Guantanamo Bay leaders requested permission to use a  wet towel and dripping water to induce "the misperception of  suffocation" and the use of "mild, non-injurious physical  contact such as grabbing, poking in the chest with the finger,  and light pushing."<p> 
			
			In response, in December 2002 Rumsfeld approved tactics  such as forcing a detainee to stand up for up four hours,  forced isolation for up to 30 days, deprivation of light, use  of 20-hour interrogations, removal of clothing, forced shaving  of facial hair, "inducing stress by use of detainee's fears  (e.g., dogs)," and use of mild physical contact that did not  cause injury.<p> 
			
			A Pentagon legal brief recommending the use of the tactics  argued that the proposed techniques were likely to pass  constitutional muster as long as they were applied "in a good  faith effort and not maliciously or sadistically for the very  purpose of causing harm."<p> 
			
			"The federal torture statute will not be violated as long  as any of the proposed strategies are not specifically intended  to cause severe physical pain or suffering or prolonged mental  harm," the legal brief said.<p> 
			
			White House legal counsel Alberto Gonzales played down some  of the documents produced by lawyers as "abstract legal  theories" that "do not reflect the policies the administration  ultimately adopted."<p> 
			
			The methods actually used, according to a memo, fell  somewhat short of what Rumsfeld approved, such as 20-hour  interrogations and deprivation of light and forced shaving.<p> 
			
			Rumsfeld abruptly rescinded most of the aggressive tactics  in a Jan. 15, 2003, order and said if any of them were believed  needed a request should be forwarded to him for a decision with  a "thorough justification" and a "detailed plan for the use of  such techniques."<p> 
			
			Then in April 2003, Rumsfeld outlined a new list of  interrogation techniques that permitted significantly  increasing the fear level in a detainee, "sleep adjustment,"  "changing the diet of a detainee" with no intended deprivation  of food or water, and isolation of detainees.<p> 
			
			An August 1, 2002, Justice Department memo detailed how to  avoid violating U.S. and international terror statutes while  interrogating prisoners.<p> 
			
			White House officials insisted the broad policy was that  prisoners should be treated humanely, but included in the  documents was an active discussion of how far interrogations  could go without being called torture.<p> 
			
			"We're going to be aggressive in our interrogations.  There's no question about that," Gonzales said. He insisted  that the United States would not engage in torture and said the  administration uses the definition of torture provided by  Congress as "a specific intent to inflict severe physical or  mental harm or suffering."<p> 
			
			The documents outlined previous and current techniques for  nearly 600 al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners now at Guantanamo  Bay, most taken in Afghanistan.<p> 
			
			A Feb. 7, 2002, memo from Bush to top members of his  administration said al Qaeda and Taliban detainees were to be  "treated humanely and to the extent appropriate and consistent  with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the  principles" of the Geneva Convention.<p> 
			
			Gonzales denied Bush's determination contributed to the  abuses at Abu Ghraib. "We categorically reject any  connections," he said.<p> 
			
			A top Pentagon lawyer, Daniel Dell'Orto, said it was clear  from the start that the Geneva Convention would apply in Iraq.<p> 
			
			He said any abuses at Guantanamo were punished.<p> 
			
			He cited an incident in which a female interrogator took  off her blouse, kept her T-shirt on, sat on a detainee's lap  "as part of her interrogation technique" and ran her hands  through his hair. She was suspended from duties for 30 days.
