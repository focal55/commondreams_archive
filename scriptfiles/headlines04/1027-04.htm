<p>Has Eminem--the poster child of American disenchantment--become the new face of activism?

<p>Those who are accustomed to Eminem's gay-bashing, gun-toting antics will hardly believe their eyes, as they watch his new video in which the top-selling rapper and his posse file into the voting booths, the words "Vote Tuesday, November 2" fading into the screen.

<!--/endimage/-->Mosh could well be one of the most overtly political pop music videos ever produced, and is easily the most direct anti-Bush cultural statement since Michael Moore's <em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em>. Although the video debuted just a week before the election, it could have an unprecedented cultural and political impact, coming from the top-grossing rap star in America, and one of the seminal pop icons of the last decade.

<p>The largely animated video begins with a suited Eminem reading "My Pet Goat" upside down to a classroom full of children. Moments later, however, Eminem shifts from his usual mode of sarcastic critique to lyrics reflecting sincere political passion.

<p>We see him shadowboxing in front of a wall plastered with newspaper headlines such as "Bush Knew," "Bush Declares War," "Congress OKs $87 Billion" and "Blechtell" [sic]. We see a soldier coming home from the war, only to find his wife holding out a letter stating "Private Kelly, You Have Been Re-Assigned to Iraq." When the soldier reads the notice, his eyes shift from shock, to fear, to outrage, as he emphatically mouths "Fuck Bush." Later, we see a woman opening an eviction notice while her children watch Bush talking about "tax cuts" on television.

<p>Mosh's brooding beat elevates the song's sense of urgency. "Let the President answer on high anarchy/Strap him with an AK-47, let him go/Fight his own war/ Let him impress daddy that way/No more blood for oil, we got our battles to fight on our own soil," he shouts.

<p>As Eminem and his battalion of urban foot soldiers march through the rain-soaked streets, there is a sense that an epic battle is imminent. He rallies the troops--"let us...set aside our differences, and assemble our own army, to disarm this weapon of mass destruction that we call our President"-- but his army eventually shuns violence for the voting booths.

<p>Critics--especially from the right--will dismiss Mosh as a shrewd attempt to boost record sales by capitalizing on the tide of anti-Bush populism. Yet, Eminem has truly made a leap with Mosh. In his first four albums--despite pointing out the absurdities of American politics and culture--his mantra, ultimately, was "I just don't give a fuck." Never before has he advocated for political change. Even if the song's late arrival gives it a limited impact on the vote, Eminem's pronounced political shift should send shivers through the largely unchecked right-wing establishment. </p>

<!--/endimage/-->I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America<br>
And to the Republic for which it stands<br>
One nation under God<br>
Indivisible<br>
It feels so good to be back..]<br>
<br>

Scrutinize every word, memorize every line<br>

I spit it once, refuel, reenergize, and rewind<br>
I give sight to the blind, mind sight through the mind<br>
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time<br>
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as<br>
I say to fight you take it as I’m gonna whip someone's ass<br>
If you don't understand don't even bother to ask<br>
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past<br>
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has<br>
Or at least shows no difficulty multi taskin<br>

And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash<br>
Entrepreneur who has held long too few more rap acts<br>
Who has had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half<br>
Of his career typical manure moving past that<br>
Mister kiss his ass crack, he's a class act<br>
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back<br>
<br>
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness<br>
As I provide just enough spark, that we need to proceed<br>

Carry on, give me hope, give me strength,<br>
Come with me, and I won't steer you wrong<br>
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog<br>
Till the light, at the end, of the tunnel, we gonna fight,<br>
We gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march through the swamp<br>
We gonna mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors<br>
<br>
To the people up top, on the side and the middle,<br>
Come together, let's all bomb and swamp just a little<br>

Just let it gradually build, from the front to the back<br>
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black<br>
Don't matter what color, all that matters is we gathered together<br>
To celebrate for the same cause, no matter the weather<br>
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better<br>
They ain't gonna stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more then ever,<br>
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go,<br>
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know<br>
Stomp, push up, mush, fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home come on just . . .<br>

<br>
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness<br>
As I provide just enough spark, that we need to proceed<br>
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength,<br>
Come with me, and I won't steer you wrong<br>
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog<br>
Till the light, at the end, of the tunnel, we gonna fight,<br>
We gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march through the swamp<br>
We gonna mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on<br>

<br>
Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us,<br>
Mosh pits outside the oval office<br>
Someone's trying to tell us something, maybe this is God just saying<br>
we're responsible for this monster, this coward, that we have empowered<br>
This is Bin Laden, look at his head nodding,<br>
How could we allow something like this, Without pumping our fist<br>
Now this is our, final hour<br>
Let me be the voice, and your strength, and your choice<br>

Let me simplify the rhyme, just to amplify the noise<br>
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply it by six<br>
Teen million people are equal of this high pitch<br>
Maybe we can reach Al Quaida through my speech<br>
Let the President answer on high anarchy<br>
Strap him with AK-47, let him go<br>
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way<br>
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our soil<br>
No more psychological warfare to trick us to think that we ain't loyal<br>

If we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero<br>
Look in his eyes, it's all lies, the stars and stripes<br>
They've been swiped, washed out and wiped,<br>
And Replaced with his own face, mosh now or die<br>
If I get sniped tonight you'll know why, because I told you to fight<br>
<br>
So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness<br>
As I provide just enough spark, that we need to proceed<br>
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength,<br>

Come with me, and I won't steer you wrong<br>
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog<br>
Till the light, at the end, of the tunnel, we gonna fight,<br>
We gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march through the swamp<br>
We gonna mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors<br>
<br>
[Eminem speaking angrily]<br>
And as we proceed, to mosh through this desert storm, in these closing statements, if they should argue, let us beg to differ, as we set aside our differences, and assemble our own army, to disarm this weapon of mass destruction that we call our president, for the present, and mosh for the future of our next generation, to speak and be heard, Mr. President, Mr. Senator<br>&nbsp;</p>
