WASHINGTON  - Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy on  Monday accused President Bush of having created at home and  abroad "the largest credibility gap" since the Watergate  scandal drove Richard Nixon from the White House 30 years ago.
<p> 
			
			Kennedy, a key backer of fellow Massachusetts Sen. John  Kerry's campaign for the party's presidential nomination, also  charged Iraq has become "George Bush's Vietnam," the war that  divided the United States and helped force Lyndon Johnson from  the presidency.
<p> 
			
			In addition, Kennedy said, Iraq has "diverted attention  from the administration's deceptions here at home -- especially  on the economy, health care and education."
<p> 
			
			In delivering perhaps his harshest assessment yet of Bush,  Kennedy described the Republican president as someone who  cannot be trusted on a host of fronts.
<p> 
			
			Kennedy, the leading liberal on Capitol Hill, renewed his  charge that the administration had misled the American people  and Congress into the Iraq war, straining relations with allies  worldwide.
<p> 
			
			He also accused the administration of having knowingly sold  an unsound tax-cutting economic plan that resulted in the loss  of millions of jobs, a faulty Medicare prescription drug law  that will cost far more than it acknowledged when the measure  won final congressional passage late last year and an education  program that Kennedy said Bush has refused to adequately fund.
<p> 
			
			"Sadly, this administration has failed to live up to basic  standards of open and candid debate," Kennedy said in a speech  at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
<p> 
			
			INVENT 'FACTS'
<p> 
			
			"They repeatedly invent 'facts' to support their  preconceived agenda -- facts which administration officials  knew or should have known were not true," Kennedy said.
<p> 
			
			The senator said, "As a result, this president has now  created the largest credibility gap since Richard Nixon," who  was forced to resign as president in 1974 as a result of the  Watergate scandal that exposed abuses of power.
<p> 
			
			In challenging Bush's credibility, Kennedy repeated a  central them of Kerry's own attacks on the incumbent.
<p> 
			
			Just months ago, Kennedy helped pump new life into Kerry's  then sputtering campaign for the 2004 Democratic presidential  nomination. Kennedy has since remained a force in Kerry's bid  to unseat Bush in the November elections.
<p> 
			
			Kennedy went after the Bush administration for pushing what  he called misleading policies, as well as for attacking critics  of those policies.
<p> 
			
			"Iraq. Jobs. Medicare. Schools," Kennedy said. "Issue after  issue. Mislead. Deceive. Make up the needed facts. Smear the  character of any critic."
<p> 
			
"It is undermining our national security, undermining our  economy, undermining our health care ... undermining our very  democracy," Kennedy said. "We need change. November can't come  soon enough."
