<p>WASHINGTON  - 
An independent commission to
investigate intelligence failures before last year's invasion
of Iraq  being demanded by Democrats could pose a serious
political threat to President Bush.

<!--/endimage/-->But analysts said with Bush's Republicans in control of
both houses of Congress he stood a good chance of avoiding such
an investigation, which would keep the issue alive in the
run-up to November's presidential election.
<p>
 "The administration wants as little attention as possible
paid to the process by which they concluded that war with Iraq
was a good idea," said Steven Walt, dean of the Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University.
<p>
 "A commission would keep the issue in the news for another
year. That's the last thing they want," he said.
<p>
 Following Senate testimony on Wednesday from former U.S.
weapons hunter David Kay that that U.S. intelligence about
Saddam Hussein's suspected weapons of mass destruction had been
fundamentally flawed, Democrats redoubled their calls for an
independent inquiry. Kay himself backed the idea.
<p>
 In a worrying sign for the White House, Arizona Republican
Sen. John McCain, known for his independent streak, broke party
ranks to support the call.
<p>
 "We need an independent commission to continue to
investigate this because these questions need to be answered,
including ... why it is that we have so badly missed the mark
on this and other cases," McCain said.
<p>
 RICE DEFLECTS CALLS
<p>
 The administration sent national security adviser
Condoleezza Rice to appear on Thursday morning news shows on
ABC, NBC and CBS to deflect the calls.
<p>
 "We simply believe that there is work still to be done. The
Iraq Survey Group is trying to complete its work," she told
NBC's Today Show.
<p>
 "In fact, the intelligence community has its own
investigation, inquiry going on -- a kind of audit of what was
known going in and what was found when they got there. They
have an external panel that is doing that for them. A lot is
going on," Rice said.
<p>
 University of Chicago political scientist Robert Pape said
the fact Rice was on three shows suggested the White House was
worried. The issue is certain to remain front and center in the
ongoing presidential campaign.
<p>
 "The fact Rice was out there on three shows tells you the
momentum for an inquiry is building and she felt she needed to
get out ahead of it and nip it in the bud," Pape said.
<p>
 Kay was careful to say he did not believe intelligence had
been manipulated by the administration making its case for
invading Iraq -- just that it had been wrong.
<p>
 "Certainly the intelligence service believed that there
were WMD (weapons of mass destruction). It turns out we were
all wrong, probably in my judgment, and that is most
disturbing," he said.
<p>
 KENNEDY: DATA "MANIPULATED"
<p>
 Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy had a starkly different
view. "What has happened was more than a failure of
intelligence -- it was the result of manipulation of the
intelligence to justify a decision to go to war," he said.
<p>
 Joseph Cirincione, author of a study released this month
concluding Iraq had no threatening weapons of mass destruction
by the late 1990s, said: "The administration is playing for
time because it sees this mainly as a political problem.
<p>
"They hope to stall until after the November presidential
election and are less interested in seeing what went wrong than
in avoiding blame," he said.
<p>
"It is lame to claim they need more time for internal
investigations. Almost everything (Secretary of State) Colin
Powell  told the U.N. last February about Iraq's alleged weapons
was wrong. Why was that? The President doesn't have an answer,"
said Cirincione, an analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
<p>
With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, the
administration stands a good chance of stonewalling calls for a
commission if its troops in the legislature hold firm.
<p>
But if the situation on the ground in Iraq were to
deteriorate or more officials came forward with information,
whether by name or anonymously, pressure for an independent
commission could mount.
<p>
"What needs to happen now is for another important
Republican to break ranks or more information to come forth.
Otherwise, the administration will probably weather the storm,"
said Pape.
