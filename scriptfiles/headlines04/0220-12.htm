<P>The photographer who snapped John Kerry attending a 1971 anti-war 
rally says he and his photo agency intend to track down  --  and possibly sue  
--  whoever doctored and circulated a photo that made it appear that the then 
27-year-old Vietnam veteran was appearing alongside actress Jane Fonda.
<P>

An image of Jane Fonda from 1972, right, was added to a photo of John Kerry at an anti-war rally in Mineola, N.Y., in 1971 to produce the doctored picture.<br>

Ken Light, now a UC Berkeley professor of journalism ethics, says he 
photographed Kerry at an anti-war rally in Mineola, N.Y., on June 13, 1971. 
The decorated Vietnam veteran was preparing to give a speech at the rally  --  
but Fonda was never at the event. 
<P>Light's photo gained prominence when someone took it and merged the shot 
of the now Democratic presidential front-runner with another separate photo of 
Fonda  --  one taken by photographer Owen Franken as the actress spoke to a 
1972 rally in Miami Beach, Fla. 
<P>The fabricated Kerry-Fonda photo was circulated with an identifying logo 
of the Associated Press and became the subject of talk show fodder after it 
was placed on many Web sites as evidence of Kerry's "anti-American" activities 
after his war service.
<P>Light said this week that the use  --  and misuse  --  of his copyrighted 
photo might result in legal action. 
<P>"(We're) doing everything possible to track down who it was and bring 
them to justice,'' said Light, who said the Associated Press also intended to 
examine the issue of who would use the agency's copyright for fraudulent 
purposes.
<P>A spokesman for Light's photo agency, Corbis, said its photographers' 
work and copyrights are treated seriously. 
<P>The agency will "investigate this matter and take appropriate action as 
necessary,'' the spokesman said.
<P>Light, who teaches at the journalism school at UC Berkeley, said he 
regularly instructed his students on matters of law and photo ethics. But 
ironically, this year, "I've become the lesson,'' he said, referring to how 
easy it has become to produce sophisticated and potentially damaging photos 
via computer.
<P>"With modern technology, anybody can do it,'' he said of the doctored 
photo of Kerry, now a 60-year-old, four-term Massachusetts senator. "Someone 
has to be really motivated and understand what they're doing.''
<P>Still, "it's one thing to (create) an image and another to try to make it 
look like it came right from a newspaper,'' Light said. The addition of the 
Associated Press logo suggested that whoever fabricated the photo was 
"definitely more than someone having fun. ... People just see it, and it 
creates this impression that it really happened."
<P>Light said he was outraged by his almost 33-year-old photo's popping into 
the news and becoming the subject of such Internet chatter.
<P>"I was completely shocked and a little disappointed there would be this 
type of fakery in a political campaign,'' he said.
<P>"You become very concerned for democracy when you realize people are so 
angry, they're desperately trying to find anything to tilt the direction of 
what people are thinking,'' he said.
