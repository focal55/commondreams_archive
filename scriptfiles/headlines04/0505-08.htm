WASHINGTON - A state election official on Wednesday cautioned against a last-minute rush to back up electronic voting with paper receipts, telling a federal commission that a change before the November election would create unnecessary confusion for voters and poll workers. 

<p>



However, another expert testifying before the U.S. Election Assistance Commission warned that such voting devices are vulnerable and flawed and called an additional paper system the only short-term solution for avoiding another disputed presidential election. 

<p>



Since switching to electronic voting in 2002, voters in Georgia have overwhelmingly supported the system with few complaints, said Kathy Rogers, director of election administration in Georgia's secretary of state office. 

<p>



"We would be negligent in our duty if we foisted an untested and untried experiment upon the voters," Rogers told the commission. 

<p>



If 1 percent of Georgia precincts had problems because of demands of new, complicated equipment under a backup paper system, Rogers said, that would comprise "a situation that no doubt would be portrayed by the media and perceived by the public as a catastrophic failure." 



<p>

Republican chairman DeForest B. Soaries Jr. responded later that he didn't expect the commission to issue requirements on electronic voting, saying the panel intended to issue "best practice" guidelines for state and local officials. 



<p>

"We will not decide on what machines people will buy," Soaries said at the commission's first public hearing. 



<p>

Aviel D. Rubin, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University, said electronic voting systems are terrible and advocated an additional paper system. "Not only have the vendors not implemented security safeguards that are possible, they have not even correctly implemented the ones that are easy," Rubin said. 

<p>



Many states are considering legislation to require a paper record of every vote cast because of technology some experts consider potentially faulty or vulnerable to attack. Others contend electronic voting offers advantages over paper balloting, including increasing access to the blind and people who do not speak English, and warn that backing up electronic systems with paper ballots could be costly. 



<p>

About 50 million Americans this fall are expected to use the ATM-like voting machines, which states rushed to get to replace paper ballots after Florida's hanging-chad fiasco in 2000. 



<p>

Phil Singer, a spokesman for the presidential campaign of Democrat John Kerry, said Wednesday, "After what happened in Florida in 2000, making sure that there is a reliable paper trail in place to account for every vote is just common sense." 



<p>

Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told reporters no printers for making receipts have been manufactured for the electronic voting machines in his state, but he suggested he is not concerned about using the machines in November. 

<p>



"I'm afraid a lot of the concerns about this are really to try to create a cloud of controversy during the election to motivate people to vote and there's got to be a better way to do that," Bush said. "You can talk about issues and ideas, maybe, instead of scaring people." 



<p>

To help prevent mishaps, the four-member bipartisan panel is expected to issue recommendations to state and local officials, such as urging poll workers to keep a stack of paper ballots available in case electronic machines fail to operate. 



<p>

Machines in more than half the precincts in California's San Diego County malfunctioned during the March 2 presidential primary, and a lack of paper ballots may have disenfranchised hundreds of voters. 



<p>

Congress created the commission under the 2002 Help America Vote Act, which began distributing $3.9 billion to states to upgrade voting systems after the disputed 2000 election. The panel is charged with ensuring the voting process is sound, although it lacks the power to enforce any standards it sets. 

<p>



The commission has said it is woefully underfunded, with only $1.2 million of its $10 million budget appropriated, prompting the commission to caution it might not have the resources to immediately forestall widespread voting problems. 



<p>

Soaries, a former New Jersey secretary of state named to the commission by President Bush  in December, has said the panel will need $2 million more this year and the full $10 million in 2005 to fulfill its mission of restoring public faith in electronic voting.
