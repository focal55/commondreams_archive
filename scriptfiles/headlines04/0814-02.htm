<p>A Marine Corps and Iraq war veteran assails the premise of the war 
in a political commercial chosen in a Web contest by the liberal Internet-
based advocacy group MoveOn.org and scheduled to air in New York during the 
Republican National Convention, which begins Aug. 30.
<P>The ad is a statement by Lee Buttrill, 30, a former Marine Corps sergeant 
who said he voted for President Bush in 2000. He was one of 40 Americans 
interviewed and filmed by Errol Morris, the documentary filmmaker who won an 
Academy Award for the 2003 film "The Fog of War," all of whom lambaste the 
president in interviews that may be packaged as political advertising.
<P>More than 100,000 MoveOn.org members cast votes for 17 finalists in the 
  <a href="https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/switchad_winners.html" target="_new">"Real People'' ad campaign</a>, and while there was a close grouping of four after 
the voting, Buttrill and his message had the most votes, the advocacy group 
said Thursday.
<P>Buttrill, of Denver, who said he worked in a Marine intelligence unit as 
an Arabic linguist in Iraq, says in the political advertisement, "We were 
given these ideas that there were weapons of mass destruction. ... It was just 
a lie. That wasn't a proper use of American troops. It wasn't a proper use of 
my life, or my friends' lives, or the Marines who I've seen die around me."
<P>Joan Blades of Berkeley, a  MoveOn.org co-founder, said the contest for 
the new advertisements had begun July 1 with an e-mail that broadly asked 
members what effect the Bush presidency had had on them. MoveOn.org received 
16,000 responses by July 6, and more than 500 of those people said they had 
voted for Bush in 2000.
<P>That group became the focus of the campaign and contest, she said. Now, 
she said, begins a fund-raising campaign to pay for the air time for the ad, 
which is produced by MoveOn.org's political action committee.
<P>MoveOn.org began in 1998 when Blades and co-founder Wes Boyd wanted to 
urge Congress to censure then-President Bill Clinton during the Monica 
Lewinsky affair rather than pursue impeachment so the country could "move on."
<P>The ad contest featuring Buttrill is the second such Web-based commercial 
contest the group has conducted this year. The group's earlier contest this 
past winter solicited supporters to produce their own ads opposing Bush's re-
election. 
<P>Karen Hanratty, the spokeswoman for the California Republican Party, said 
of the new ad: "MoveOn is good at finding anecdotal evidence to make sweeping 
generalizations. The fact is, the documentaries and commercials they are 
promoting do not support the overwhelming opinion of voters or even that of 
John Kerry, who said that even if he had known there were not weapons of mass 
destruction, he would have voted in favor of the war.
<P>"MoveOn exaggerates anecdotal evidence to draw conclusions of a broad 
population, but those conclusions are inaccurate,'' Hanratty said.
