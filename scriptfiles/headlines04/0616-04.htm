<p>Michael Moore's controversial documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" is 
creating a political firestorm even before its official opening next week  --  
with a conservative grassroots organization announcing Tuesday the start of a 
campaign urging movie theaters to reject the film.

<!--/endimage/-->The California-based organization, called <a href="http://www.moveamericaforward.org" target="_new">Move America Forward</a>, is headed 
by former GOP Assemblyman Howard Kaloogian and aided by Melanie Morgan, a talk 
show host on KSFO 560 AM, both of whom had high-profile roles in support of 
last year's recall election of former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.
<P>"It's political propaganda," Kaloogian said Tuesday of the film, which he 
labeled anti-American.
<P>Kaloogian said Moore has a right to his views, but "we also have a right 
to tell movie theater owners and the industry that this is not the fare that 
passes as entertainment  --  let alone documentary.''
<P>Moore's film criticizes President Bush for his response to the Sept. 11 
terrorist attacks. 
<P>The announcement by Kaloogian's group prompted a quick response from 
Lion's Gate, one of the film's distributors.
<P>"It is unfortunate that people who don't want to see this film are trying 
to interfere with the rights of people who may want to decide for themselves. 
Regardless of a person's political perspective, we hope that everybody can 
agree that censorship is antithetical to the American way," Lion's Gate said 
in a statement.
<P>The movie is scheduled for nationwide release June 25.
<P>Moore has hired Democratic strategists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani  --  
both former spokesmen in President Bill Clinton's administration and based in 
California  --  to handle what he anticipates will be attacks on the movie 
from Bush supporters.
<P>Kaloogian's group has hired veteran Republican political strategist Sal 
Russo to help its effort. Another conservative group, Citizens United, headed 
by David Bossie, also is reportedly planning  to protest Moore's film with a 
television commercial.
