<p>WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats ripped into  the Bush administration's handling of Haiti on Wednesday,  saying its failure to support ousted President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide sent a chilling signal to democratically elected  governments in this hemisphere.<p>

Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus at a  House of Representative's committee hearing also questioned  whether the administration had mistreated Aristide as it  bundled him out of Haiti, and said it had left the country in  the hands of thugs, murderers and narco-traffickers.<p> 
			
			In frequently testy exchanges with lawmakers, Assistant  Secretary of State Roger Noriega said the United States did not  have an obligation to put its forces in harm's way to shore up  Aristide.<p> 
			
			"We have to make decisions about where we will put American  lives at risk," Noriega, who heads State Department Western  Hemisphere operations, told a House International Relations  subcommittee.<p> 
			
			"The erratic, irresponsible behavior of Aristide in the  last 48 hours ... did mean he was not a sustainable political  solution," he said. Aristide, he said, had "undermined  democracy and economic development in Haiti rather than  strengthened it."<p> 
			
			More than 1,000 U.S. troops are on the ground in Haiti as  part of a multinational force approved by the United Nations on  Sunday after Aristide was driven from power following days of  burning and looting. French and Canadian troops were also in  Haiti to join a force expected to grow to about 5,000.<p> 
			
			Rep. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said people in  this hemisphere were "watching this government turn its back on  democracy. .... The message is clear. This government will not  stand up for a democratically elected head of state they do not  like."<p> 
			
			"You didn't want a diplomatic solution to this problem. You  wanted to get rid of Aristide," said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New  York Democrat.<p> 
			
			REFUGEE STATUS FOR HAITIANS?<p> 
			
			Lawmakers also pressed the administration on whether it  would provide temporary refugee status to Haitians fleeing the  violence, saying the policy of repatriation left them to almost  certain retribution in their country.
			<p> 
			
			But Assistant Secretary of State Arthur Dewey said: "There  is concurrence now ... that it is not time to recommend that  status and the reason is that the situation is just too fluid."
			<p>Rep. Charles Rangel, another New York Democrat, pressed  Noriega on whether the administration demanded that Aristide  resign as a condition of giving him safe passage out of Haiti.
<p> 
			
			Noriega said the administration "probably" would have  helped him leave the country without his resignation for  humanitarian reasons, but said the administration "wanted to  have a sustainable solution to avoid bloodshed."<p> 
			
			He said Aristide's departure "was never a U.S. demand."  U.S. officials cleared an expansion of Aristide's security as  violence mounted, Noriega said, but were not willing to put  U.S. troops on the ground to protect him.<p> 
			
			Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said she had a  telephone conversation on Wednesday with Aristide in which he  repeated his charge that the United States forced him to leave  Haiti against his will, and was in effect kidnapped.<p> 
			
			Administration officials have dismissed that claim as  nonsense, but lawmakers pressed Noriega on how Aristide was  transported to the Central African Republic and name U.S.  officials involved.<p> 
			
			Florida Republican Rep. Porter Goss said that could  endanger those officials, and praised the administration,  saying the "the efforts you have made have probably led to  results that are the best we can have."
