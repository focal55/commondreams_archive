Springsteen, who is traveling with the Kerry campaign for the last five days of the election drive, opened his two-song set with &quot;Promised Land.&quot;  In the song, he urges people to &quot;blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and broken hearted.&quot;
<p>Then he spoke directly to the audience. &quot;I've been writing songs about America for thirty year, about what America stands for, and what America fights for,&quot; he said. &quot;The essential ideas of America's identity are what is at stake November 2.&quot;
<p>He praised Kerry for honoring America's ideals, for addressing issues of economic justice, health care, civil rights, the environment, for advocating &quot;a sane and responsible foreign policy,&quot; and for &quot;safeguarding our precious democracy.&quot;
<p>He said Kerry has &quot;an adult view&quot; of our place in the world and &quot;understands that we are not infallible.&quot;  He said Kerry has helped America face its &quot;hard truths&quot; and find a &quot;deeper patriotism&quot; and will &quot;make our world a better and a safer place.&quot;
<p>Springsteen invoked the name of Paul Wellstone, mentioning that the late Senator from Minnesota had a saying, &quot;The future is for the passionate.&quot; To that, Springsteen added: &quot;Well, the future is now, and let your passions loose. The country we carry in our hearts is waiting.&quot;
<p>He ended with Kerry's anthem, &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender,&quot; which contains the line, &quot;I want to sleep underneath peaceful skies.&quot;
<p>After the song, Kerry bounded onto the stage and clasped Springsteen's hand and praised him for singing about real people. &quot;The people he sings about,&quot; said Kerry, &quot;are the people we need to fight for and have representation for in the White House.&quot;
<p>Then Kerry cracked a joke: &quot;When George Bush heard the Boss was going to be with me today, he thought I was talking about Dick Cheney.&quot;
<p>He went over the familiar ground of his stump speech, but highlighted the story of the unguarded explosives' depot in Iraq.
<p>&quot;This week's story about the missing explosives,&quot; he said, underscores &quot;the continuing misjudgments of the President. According to the commanders on the ground . . . our forces were never, ever given the orders to secure the ammo depot.&quot;
<p>Kerry slammed Bush for his &quot;shifting explanations&quot; and his penchant for &quot;blaming anybody but himself.&quot; In Bush's Administration, Kerry said, &quot;the buck stops anywhere but with themselves.&quot;
<p>Kerry was quick to praise the troops. &quot;Our troops on the ground are doing a heroic job,&quot; he said. &quot;They're doing their job. The commander in chief is not doing his.&quot;
<p>He chided Bush for not protecting America's ports and chemical plants and airplane cargoes and for saying, in the first debate, &quot;How are we going to pay for that?&quot;
<p>And he mocked Bush for repeating in that debate, &quot;It's hard work. It's hard work. It's hard work.&quot;
<p>Kerry said, &quot;I'm ready and impatient to relieve the President of that hard work and to get to work for America.&quot;</p>
