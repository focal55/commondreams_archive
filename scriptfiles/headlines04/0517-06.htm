<p>Fifty years to the day after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed school 
segregation, another court ruling will allow same-sex couples to marry in 
Massachusetts today. 
<P>There are many differences between Brown vs. Board of Education and 
Goodridge vs. Department of Health Services - for one, gays and lesbians have 
not faced the same historic level of discrimination as African Americans - but 
the two cases have more in common than a date.
<P>Both the nation's high court and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court 
used their constitutional power to protect a politically weak minority from 
state laws that the justices considered discriminatory, directing legal and 
societal changes from the bench that would not have happened in a state 
legislature.
<P>In the intervening decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has followed much the 
same path in rulings that legalized abortion and interracial marriages, 
outlawed organized school prayer, suspended the death penalty nationwide from 
1972 to 1976 and required police to tell suspects of their right to remain 
silent and consult a lawyer. Last year, the court overturned state laws 
against consensual sodomy, a ruling that laid the groundwork for the 
Massachusetts decision on same-sex marriage.
<P>Following the Supreme Court's lead, lower courts have taken control of 
prisons and mental hospitals after finding that the state was failing to 
protect inmates, another vulnerable group, from abuse.
<P>The model for each case was Brown, which set a modern precedent for the 
judiciary as the guardian of rights - some constitutionally specified, some 
not - for the outcast, the downtrodden and the unpopular. The extent to which 
courts can, and should, perform that role remains a topic of hot debate.
<P>"When the court advances liberty or equality in a way that the 
legislature won't, I think the court's performing its highest mission,'' said 
University of Southern California Law Professor Erwin Chemerinsky. "I believe 
that the courts make a positive difference in society.''
<P>To take two prominent examples, he said, abortion was illegal in 46 
states on the day before Roe vs. Wade was decided in 1973, and legal in all 50 
states the day after; private homosexual conduct was illegal in 13 states 
before the Supreme Court struck down those laws last year.
<P>But John Eastman, law professor at Chapman University in Orange, said 
courts raise questions about judicial legitimacy when they second-guess 
elected lawmakers - particularly on subjects that are not mentioned in the 
Constitution, like abortion and gay rights.
<P>Even in the Brown case, whose equal-protection rationale he supports, 
Eastman said the court should have confined its ruling to individual students 
and districts and left broader changes to the democratic process, where they 
would have been "longer lasting and more stable.''
<P>Such critiques are not limited to conservatives like Eastman. Liberal 
scholar Mark Tushnet's 1999 book, "Taking the Constitution Away From the 
Courts,'' advocated relying on political rather than judicial action to 
protect individual rights. And University of Virginia Law Professor Michael 
Klarman argues that rulings like Brown and the Goodridge decision in 
Massachusetts often backfire.
<P>"By outpacing public opinion on issues of social reform, such rulings 
mobilize opponents, undercut moderates, and retard the cause they purport to 
advance,'' Klarman said in a recent law review article. "... In the short term,
Brown retarded progressive racial reform in the South'' by generating a 
fierce backlash, and Goodridge appears to be having the same effect, he said.
<P>Brown-style activism on behalf of minorities has been rare in Supreme 
Court history. A different kind of activist court overturned minimum-wage laws 
and other economic regulations on property-rights grounds early in the 20th 
century, relenting in the late 1930s only after President Franklin Roosevelt 
proposed his court-packing plan to appoint additional justices.
<P>The court laid the groundwork for the modern era with a famous footnote 
in a 1938 case suggesting that minorities who were not protected by the 
political process were entitled to special constitutional status. It took 
another 16 years, a procession of new justices and a wave of social changes to 
turn the judicial theory into dramatic reality.
<P>Klarman attributed the Brown ruling to developments outside the court: 
World War II's effect on racial attitudes, a rise in African American 
political power and the growth of a black middle class, and Cold War politics, 
which made Southern white supremacy an international embarrassment.
<P>"The justices in Brown did not think they were creating a movement for 
racial reform; they understood that they were working with, not against, 
historical forces,'' Klarman wrote, adding that the civil rights movement was 
the chief catalyst for change.
<P>Other commentators said the court deserves more credit. Pulitzer Prize-
winning historian David Garrow called the Brown ruling "a huge motivating, 
encouraging force'' for such watershed events as the Montgomery bus boycott of 
1955-56 and the sit-ins of the early 1960s. USC's Chemerinsky said the ruling 
ultimately doomed Southern segregation in all walks of life and represented a 
triumph for the court's power to subject laws to constitutional review.
<P>Fast-forward a half-century. Today's Supreme Court is arguably as 
activist as the court that decided Brown, usually in another direction - 
overturning federal disability-rights and gun-control laws in the name of 
state autonomy - but occasionally in decisions reminiscent of the earlier 
court, like last year's ruling overturning state sodomy laws.
<P>Courts in some states, like Massachusetts, are taking the lead in 
expanding constitutional protections - perhaps following the path of the 
California Supreme Court, which defied public opinion and decades of 
precedents by overturning a ban on interracial marriage in 1948, 19 years 
ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>Both sides of the same-sex marriage issue are preparing for crucial tests 
on opposite coasts: in California, where the state Supreme Court hears 
arguments May 25 on the legality of same-sex weddings in San Francisco, and in 
Massachusetts, where the state court's ruling allowing gay marriages to begin 
on Monday could be undone by a 2006 ballot measure.
<P>Whether the marriage cases are part of the legacy of Brown and the 
surrounding civil rights movement is one point of disagreement between the 
opposing sides. But veteran gay-rights litigator Evan Wolfson, executive 
director of Freedom to Marry, draws another lesson from the Brown case.
<P>"The tremendous resistance that followed Brown showed it's not enough to 
win a legal victory,'' he said, stressing the need to organize politically and 
change public attitudes.
<P>"Courts have sometimes been willing to get out ahead of the nation, but 
we have an obligation not to leave them out there.''
