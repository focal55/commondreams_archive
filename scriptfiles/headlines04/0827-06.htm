<p>NEW YORK (CBS) -- More protestors made their voices heard on Friday morning, ahead of next week’s Republican National Convention. Dozens of women who call themselves 'MOB-sters' took their anti-Bush message to the Brooklyn Bridge.

The group '<a href="http://www.mob.org/" target="_new">Mothers Opposing Bush</a>,' also known as 'MOB,' marched across the bridge with their children and strollers in tow.

<p>They're rallying against president bush's positions on education, healthcare, environment and civil rights. They claim the policies endanger their children's future.

<p>The protesters Friday were equipped with buttons that said "Join the MOB." They also carried diapers, baby food and red, white and blue balloons. 

<p>"I'm not a mother, but I don't want Maya to grow up in a world where the only solution to problems is war," said Noah Haiduc-Dale, who was marching with his 3-month-old daughter.
<p>The grassroots group that claims 10,000 members nationwide - including Republicans, Democrats and independents - was started in Annapolis, Md. by mother-of-four Iris Krasnow. <p>
"We want to reclaim the soul of America, which we feel has been doused by this dangerous administration. We want to protect what's closest to a family's heart - health care, education, the economy and the environment," Krasnow said in a telephone interview from Annapolis, where she was busy organizing her group's activities in 160 cities before the November election. <p>
Friday's MOB march in New York was led by a pair of 4-year-olds with their "Kids for Kerry" banner. <p>
"He's the president _ but not right now," said Tiber Worth, holding one end while his classmate Isabella Stevenson clutched the other as they headed across the bridge.
