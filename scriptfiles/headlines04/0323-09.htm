<p>WASHINGTON   - Democrats on Tuesday accused the  White House of election-year "abuses of power" in trying to  discredit former top U.S. counter-terrorism official Richard  Clarke, who has accused President Bush of ignoring threats from  al Qaeda before the Sept. 11 attacks.<p>

The controversy over Clarke's '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743260244/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Against All Enemies</a>,'' which alleges that the Bush administration was slow to act against bin Laden before the Sept. 11 attacks, has helped make the book--released Monday, March 22,2004-- an instant best seller.

Democrats took to the Senate floor to lambaste the Bush  White House, which had fiercely condemned Clarke on Monday.<p> 
			
			"We are seeing abuses of power that cannot be tolerated.  The president needs to put a stop to it right now. We need to  get to the truth and the president needs to help us do that,"  Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said.<p> 
			
			Clarke specifically accused Bush of paying insufficient  attention to the al Qaeda threat before the Sept. 11, 2001  attacks and thereafter focusing on Iraq at the expense of  efforts to crush the Islamic militant group.<p> 
			
			His attack coincided with efforts by Bush to make his  leadership on security and terrorism the major theme of his  campaign for re-election in November.<p> 
			
			The White House responded by noting that Clarke had been  the top U.S. counter-terrorism official for eight years before  Bush took office and had failed to prevent a number of al Qaeda  attacks from taking place.<p> 
			
			It also said Clarke was speaking out for political reasons  and was acting out of pique for having been passed over for a  top job under Bush.<p> 
			
			Speaking during a cabinet meeting, Bush rejected Clarke's  criticism that he ignored the threat from al Qaeda.<p> 
			
			"The facts are these: (CIA Director) George Tenet briefed  me on a regular basis about the terrorist threats to the United  State of America and had my administration had any information  that terrorists were going to attack New York City on Sept. 11,  we would have acted," he said.<p> 
			
			SQUELCHING DISSENT<p> 
			
			Top Democrats tried to turn the political tables on Bush by  accusing the administration of attempting to squelch dissent  and bad news on a range of fronts.<p> 
			
			They recalled moves to discredit former Treasury Secretary  Paul O'Neill, who questioned Bush's Iraq policy in a book in  January, and the leaking of the identity of CIA operative  Valerie Plame when her husband, former diplomat Joseph Wilson,  accused Bush of hyping prewar intelligence on Iraq.<p> 
			
			Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota pointed to a "shroud of  secrecy" in the administration. In remarks aimed at Bush, New  York Sen. Charles Schumer said, "Don't hide the facts ... don't  try to undermine those who would present the facts."<p> 
			
			Daschle called "impeccable' Clarke's reputation from 30  years in four administrations and told reporters, "I happen to  believe Mr. Clarke." He also called for an investigation of  Clarke's allegations.<p> 
			
			Clarke rejected White House charges that he was playing  election-year politics by timing the release of his book  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743260244/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Against All Enemies</a>," detailing his criticisms of the Bush  approach, for this week.
			<p> 
			
			He said publication was held up by the administration for  three months for a security check and he had not intended for  it to be released in the middle of the election campaign.<p> 
			
			"I'm not doing this because I'm disgruntled, I'm doing this  because I think the American people need to know the truth," he  told ABC's "Good Morning America."
