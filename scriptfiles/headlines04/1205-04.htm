<p>Iraq's security forces are unable to handle the challenge presented by the first elections since the fall of Saddam, even with extra American soldiers being deployed to help them, according to one of the US military's most senior officers. 
<p>The comments from General John Abizaid, head of US Central Command, follows months of statements by senior officials - from George Bush downwards - talking up Iraq's new police and national guard forces.  
<p>It comes as UN election adviser Lakhdar Brahimi cast fresh doubt on whether elections could take place in the present circumstances.  
<p>Brahimi told a Dutch newspaper in an interview published yesterday: 'Elections are no magic potion, but part of a political process. They must be prepared well and take place at the right time to produce the good effects that you expect from them.'  
<p>Asked if elections under present conditions were possible, Brahimi said: 'If the circumstances stay as they are, I personally don't think so. It is a mess in Iraq.'  
<p>The comments came after fresh attacks on Iraqi police this weekend and a week in which the US embassy banned its employees from using the road to Baghdad airport because of the dangers involved.  
<p>Yesterday the Black Watch regiment rolled back into Basra after a controversial month-long stay at Camp Dogwood. Soldiers declared 'mission accomplished' as a convoy of more than 200 vehicles arrived at the relative safety of Shaibah logistics base. They lost five comrades who died during the regiment's deployment.
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel James Cowan, who led the Black Watch mission, said: 'Their deaths are something we will never forget. To lose close friends is something we will always remember and our thoughts are with their   families.'  
<p>General Abizaid's comments follow the announcement on Wednesday of the additional American troop numbers. The Pentagon announced the total figure would grow to about 150,000 by mid-January - slightly more than during the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam. The increase was to come largely through extending until March tours of duty of more than 10,000 soldiers and marines who were to return home in January.  
<p>'It had been our hope that we would be able to have a combination of increases that mainly were Iraqi troops' increases,' Abizaid told reporters on the sidelines of a closed-door regional security conference. 'And while the Iraqi troops are larger in number than they used to be, those forces have to be seasoned more, trained more. So, it's necessary to bring more American forces.'  
<p>Abizaid, trading his military uniform for a dark suit and tie, declined to speculate on when the Iraqi forces would be ready. In September, George Bush said Iraq's government commanded almost 100,000 trained, combat-ready Iraqis, including police, national guards and army; he had predicted that would rise to 125,000 by the end of 2004.
