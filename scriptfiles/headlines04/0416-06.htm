Wanted Shiite Muslim radical leader Moqtada Sadr said a compromise with the US-led coalition "will not work" and he was prepared to die as a "martyr" fighting the occupation forces.
<p> 
"We will not allow the forces of occupation to enter Najaf and the holy sites because they are forbidden places for them," said Sadr in a fiery sermon at the grand mosque of Kufa, in his first public appearance in two weeks.
<p> 
"I say that they are here to stay and will occupy us for many years and as such compromise will not work."
<p> 
Sadr, who is wanted in connection with the murder of a rival cleric last year, said "it is those that attacked civilians in Fallujah and innocent protesters that must be put on trial".
<p> 
The firebrand cleric said he was waging "the revolution of the Imam Mehdi," the 12th Imam of the Shiite Muslims and their believed savior.
<p> 
"It is martyrdom that I am yearning for so support me and know that this a war on Shiites," said Sadr, who has surrounded himself with thousands of armed fighters while US forces marshall outside the holy city.
<p> 
US commanders have said their mission is to capture or kill Sadr but they insist they are ready to let all diplomatic options, including an ongoing effort from a senior Iranian delegation, run their course.
<p> 
Sadr had harsh words for the Shiites on the US-appointed Governing Council who have been trying to mediate a peaceful solution to the crisis.
<p> 
"I address the agents of the west ... they say that we are delaying the handover of power and the formation of government, but I tell them that we have delayed selling Iraq and creating a government of agents," he said.
<p> 
Sadr's Mehdi Army militia have battled coalition troops in a bloody uprising across central and southern Iraq over the past two weeks, raising fears of a broader uprising among the country's Shiite majority.
<p> 
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Sadr's rebellion was waning and the "situation in the south at this time is largely stabilized".
<p> 
"Sadr's bid to foment a popular uprising is failing," Rumsfeld said as Washington announced plans to extend the deployment of 20,000 troops in Iraq.
