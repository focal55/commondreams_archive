<p>DAVOS, Switzerland - Security analysts and a
leading human rights campaigner called Wednesday for a rethink
of the war on terror and challenged President Bush's assertion
that it was making America safer.
<p>
 Bush devoted much of Tuesday's State of the Union address
to rallying Americans behind the war on terror, telling them
the nation must not falter and leave its work unfinished.

<!--/endimage/-->He saluted the hundreds of thousands of U.S. servicemen
deployed across the world and declared, "By bringing hope to
the oppressed and delivering justice to the violent, they are
making America more secure."
<p>
But independent analysts at the opening session of the
World Economic Forum in Switzerland said that far from making
the country safer, the war on terror and the invasion of Iraq 
had served only to aggravate the dangers.
<p>
 "No, we are not safer," said Jessica Stern, lecturer in
public policy at Harvard University.
<p>
 "Going into Iraq in the way we did, without broad
international support, really increased the ability of al Qaeda
and its sympathizers to 'prove' that the objective of the
United States is to humiliate the Islamic world, more than it
was to liberate the Iraqi people." Gareth Evans, former
Australian foreign minister and head of the International
Crisis Group think-tank, said al Qaeda and its sympathizers had
expanded their theater of operations since the September 11
attacks to countries including Morocco, Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and Indonesia.
<p>
 "The unhappy truth is that the net result of the war on
terror, so far at least, has been more war and more terror,"
Evans said.
<p>
 "In Iraq, the least plausible of all the reasons for going
to war -- terrorism -- has now become the most harrowing of its
consequences."
<p>
 Security and terrorism are major themes of this year's
World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, attended
by more than 2,280 participants from 94 countries, including 31
heads of state or government.
<p>
 Bush, in his speech to Congress, stressed the importance of
U.S. military action, tighter law enforcement and new security
measures such as the requirement on foreign airlines to submit
passenger lists in advance to U.S. authorities.
<p>
 But participants in the Davos discussion urged more
attention be devoted to tackling underlying grievances, such as
the Arab-Israeli conflict and the unresolved dispute between
India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
<p>
 Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch,
said measures like the detention without trial of more than 600
"enemy combatants" at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, had surrendered
the moral high ground and provided a rallying point for
militants.
<p>
 "While undoubtedly the Bush administration is leading the
war against terrorism, it -- in an odd way - has also become
the chief recruiter for al Qaeda," he said.
<p>
 In rare praise for Bush, former Israeli prime minister Ehud
Barak  said the president's leadership was helping to bring
about a safer world. The televised image of a docile Saddam
Hussein, submitting to medical checks after his capture, sent a
powerful message to the leaders of Libya, Iran, Syria and North
Korea.
<p>
 But he acknowledged the success of al Qaeda leader Osama
bin Laden, despite the war on terror, in stirring up support in
the Islamic world.
<p>
 "The real achievement of Osama bin Laden...is that he
ignited the imagination of hundreds of millions in the Arab
world. That's his ultimate weapon. That's what gives him hope
and patience and a kind of evil optimism," Barak said.
