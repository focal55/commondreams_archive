<p>LONDON - The rules of war protecting civilians  and wounded combatants have been broken by both sides in the  week-long assault on the Iraqi city of Falluja, the human  rights group Amnesty International said on Monday.

The London-based group, which gave examples of what it said  were breaches of the rules by both U.S. troops and insurgents,  demanded that all violations be investigated and those  responsible brought to justice.
<p> 
			
			Not only had the attacking U.S. and Iraqi troops failed to  take the necessary steps to ensure that non-combatants did not  come under fire, but insurgents had also abused flags of truce  and fired indiscriminately.<p> 
			
			"Amnesty International fears that civilians have been  killed, in contravention of international humanitarian law, as  a result of failure by parties to the fighting to take  necessary precautions to protect non-combatants," Amnesty said.<p> 
			
			Amnesty said 20 Iraqi medical staff and dozens of other  civilians were killed when a missile hit a Falluja clinic on  Nov. 9, according to a doctor who survived the strike -- though  it was not known who fired the missile.<p> 
			
			On the same day a 9-year-old boy bled to death after being  hit in the stomach by shrapnel. Unable to take him to hospital  because of the fighting, his parents buried him in their  garden.<p> 
			
			Elsewhere a woman and her three daughters were reported  killed when their house was bombed, Amnesty said.<p> 
			
			It also said a British television program, Channel Four  News, broadcast footage on Nov. 11 that appeared to show an  American soldier firing a shot in the direction of a wounded  insurgent behind a wall and then commenting "he's gone."<p> 
			
			"Under international humanitarian law the U.S. forces have  an obligation to protect fighters hors de combat. Amnesty  International calls on the U.S. authorities to investigate this  incident immediately," the human rights watchdog said.<p> 
			
			It said insurgents were also reported to have violated  international humanitarian law.<p> 
			
			WHITE FLAG A RUSE<p> 
			
			"In one incident, some Iraqis are reported to have come out  of a building waving a white flag. When a Marine approached  this group, insurgents opened fire on the Marines from  different directions."<p> 
			
			A U.S. military official in Iraq also accused insurgents of  storing weapons in mosques and schools. Insurgents were  reported to be firing from a mosque on Nov. 10, Amnesty said.<p> 
			
			"All violations of international humanitarian law and human  rights law must be investigated and those responsible for  unlawful attacks, including deliberate targeting of civilians,  indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, and the killing of  injured persons must be brought to justice," it added.<p> 
			
			Although half the city's civilian population was reported  to have left the city before the assault began, the tens of  thousands left behind were in dire straits, it said. Falluja's  normal population is believed to be about 300,000.<p> 
			
			"There are concerns that a humanitarian crisis is looming  with acute shortages of food, water, medicine and with no  electricity. There are also many wounded people who could not  receive medical care because of the fighting," it added.
