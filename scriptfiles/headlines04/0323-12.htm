<p>WASHINGTON - Twenty-five years after a
near-catastrophe at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant exposed
lax safety practices, owners and regulators of the nation's
aging fleet of 103 reactors still face nagging questions about
their ability to prevent mishaps.

These concerns, worsened by recent findings of massive
corrosion at a plant in Ohio, have so far kept utilities from
pursuing new nuclear plants for more than two decades despite
their potential to replace aging, air-polluting coal units.
 <p>
 In a bid to change that trend, the Bush administration has
promoted incentives to build new nuclear plants. But the
outlook is uncertain because a Republican-written energy bill
with some of the administration's proposals has long been
stalled in the U.S. Senate.
 <p>
 On March 28, 1979, Walter Cronkite opened his nightly news
broadcast for CBS television, calling the accident at Three
Mile Island "the first step in a nuclear nightmare."
 <p>
 That was the first time that many Americans heard of the
mishap, the most serious accident in U.S. nuclear history.
 <p>
 A string of mechanical failures and human errors caused the
accident at the Pennsylvania plant after operators with
Metropolitan Edison Co. switched off crucial equipment that
could have lessened the severity of the partial meltdown.
 <p>
 Early that morning, pumps feeding cooling water to the
plant's reactor failed, and 32,000 gallons (121,000 liters) of
radioactive, superheated water spewed from a dodgy valve into
the domed concrete reactor housing. Without water to cool them,
more than half of the reactor's 36,000 nuclear fuel rods
ruptured.
 <p>
 Government scientists said the 636,000 people living within
20 miles of the plant got only minor doses of radiation.
 <p>
 The near-catastrophe at the plant perched on an island in
the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg effectively halted any
expansion of the U.S. nuclear energy industry, which generates
about 20 percent of the nation's electricity.
 <p>
 The resulting cancellation of dozens of planned nuclear
plants forced utilities to rely on decades-old nuclear and
coal-burning plants for growing electric power demands.
 <p>
 Meanwhile, activist groups worry that current security
measures cannot prevent a terrorist attack on a U.S. nuclear
plant.
 <p>
 OHIO PLANT RAISES FRESH CONCERNS
 <p>
 Safety concerns continue to plague the industry.
 <p>
 NRC inspectors in early 2002 found massive corrosion at an
Ohio nuclear plant owned by FirstEnergy Corp. . Leaking boric
acid used as a coolant ate a football-sized hole in the steel
outer hull protecting the Davis-Besse plant's reactor core.
 <p>
 No radiation was released, and the NRC allowed FirstEnergy
to begin reviving the unit this month after the utility agreed
to change its "safety culture."
 <p>
 NRC Chairman Nils Diaz said the agency "dropped the ball"
by not spotting the corrosion sooner. "It was no way to do
business, either on the part of operators or regulators," Diaz
said.
 <p>
 Nuclear industry officials bristle at any connection
between the Three Mile Island and Davis-Besse incidents, and
point to advances in operator training and plant design.
<p>
 But industry watchdogs say the aging U.S. nuclear utility
fleet could be nearing the end of its trouble-free life, with
incidents like Davis-Besse foreshadowing mishaps to come.
<p>
"We haven't seen a lot of near-misses in this country since
(Three Mile Island)," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety
engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists. "But the other
end of the curve is what we're approaching, if we're not there
already."
<p>
The Bush administration, meanwhile, wants to jump-start the
industry with an energy plan aimed at building at least one new
nuclear power plant in the United States by 2010.
<p>
One version of the energy bill stalled in the Senate would
give tax incentives to build new plants, with a cost of &#36;10
billion. The incentives could be stripped from the bill to
appease budget concerns from the administration and others.
<p>
Utilities have relied on squeezing more megawatts from
existing nuclear plants. Capacity factors went from 58 percent
in 1980 to 92 percent in 2002, forestalling the need to build
new plants, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.
<p>
The industry says the NRC carefully reviews capacity
increases to ensure safety.
<p>
But with a dearth of new building, aging nuclear plants
pose a risk, said Jim Riccio, an antinuclear advocate at
Greenpeace.
<p>
"After Three Mile Island, the pendulum definitely swung in
the direction of safety," he said. "In the last 25 years, it
has swung in the other direction. They're running these plants
to the verge of breakdown."
