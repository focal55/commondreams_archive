<p>WASHINGTON   - A majority of Americans now say the  war in Iraq was not worth fighting, a view that has driven down  the ratings of President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald  Rumsfeld, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll  released on Monday.<p> 
			
			Fifty-six percent of those questioned, a new high, said  that the cost of the war outweighs the benefits and is not  worth it. It marked a gain of seven percentage points from a  poll conducted in July.<p> 
			
			Fifty-seven percent said they disapprove of the way Bush is  handling the situation in Iraq, and 53 percent disapprove of  the way Rumsfeld is handling his job, according to the survey.<p> 
			
			However, 60 percent said the Iraqi elections scheduled for  Jan. 30 should go forward regardless of the security situation.<p> 
			
			The poll also found that most Americans -- 58 percent --  still say U.S. forces should remain in Iraq until order is  restored.<p> 
			
			Several Republican lawmakers have expressed doubts about  Rumsfeld's performance and some Democrats want him fired over  his handling of the war. More than half of the poll  respondents, 52 percent, said Rumsfeld should be replaced.<p> 
			
			Separately, a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll also found  growing pessimism over Iraq. Nearly 60 percent said they  disapprove of the way the United States was handling the  situation in Iraq and 52 percent said Rumsfeld should resign.<p> 
			
			Bush defended Rumsfeld at a news conference on Monday,  saying the Pentagon chief was "a good human being" and "doing a  really fine job."<p> 
			
			According to the ABC News/Washington Post poll, Bush's  approval rating on Iraq dropped to 42 percent, down from 60  percent a year ago. Fewer than half said they believe there has  been significant progress toward restoring order in Iraq, down  from 51 percent last summer.<p> 
			
			The ABC News/Washington Post telephone poll of 1,004 adults  was conducted Dec. 16-19 and has a three-point margin of error.<p> 
			
			The USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup poll of 1,002 adults was conducted  Dec. 17-19 and has a 4.5-point margin of error.
