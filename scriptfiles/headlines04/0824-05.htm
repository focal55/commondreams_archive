<p>WASHINGTON   - Top Pentagon officials and the  military command in Iraq contributed to an environment in which  prisoners were abused at Abu Ghraib prison, according to a  report released on Tuesday by high-level panel investigating  the military detentions.<p> 
			
			The outside four-member panel headed by former Defense  Secretary James Schlesinger found that Defense Secretary Donald  Rumsfeld and the Joint Chiefs of Staff failed to exercise  proper oversight over confusing detention policies at U.S.  prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as at the U.S. naval  base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<p> 
			
			"Command failures were compounded by poor advice provided  by staff officers with responsibility for overseeing  battlefield functions related to detention and interrogation  operations," the report said. "Military and civilian leaders at  the Pentagon share this burden of responsibility."<p> 
			
			The panel did not find that Rumsfeld or military leaders  directly ordered abuse such as stripping prisoners naked and  sexually humiliating them. It said, however, that the abuses  were not carried out by just a few individuals, as the Bush  administration has consistently maintained.<p> 
			
			Schlesinger said there were 300 cases of abuses being  investigated, many beyond Abu Ghraib. "So the abuses were not  limited to a few individuals." He said there was "sadism" by  some Americans at Abu Ghraib.<p> 
			
			"It was a kind of animal house on the night shift" at the  jail, he added.<p> 
			
			The report said prisoner interrogation policies in Iraq  were inadequate and deficient, and changes made by Rumsfeld  between December 2002 and April 2003 in what interrogation  techniques were permitted contributed to uncertainties in the  field as to what actions were allowed and what were forbidden.<p> 
			
			The report said an expanded list of more coercive  techniques that Rumsfeld allowed for Guantanamo "migrated to  Afghanistan and Iraq, where they were neither limited nor  safeguarded."<p> 

			
			The Schlesinger panel, named by Rumsfeld in May to look  into the abuse and how effectively the Pentagon addressed it,  also includes former Defense Secretary Harold Brown, former  Florida Republican Rep. Tillie Fowler and retired Air Force  Gen. Charles Horner, who led the allied air campaign in the  1991 Gulf War.<p> 
			
			Echoing an earlier investigation headed by Army Maj. Gen.  Antonio Taguba, the Schlesinger panel said the "weak and  ineffectual leadership" of Army Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski,  commander of the 800th Military Police Brigade at Abu Ghraib,  "allowed the abuses at Abu Ghraib."<p> 
			
			In a statement released by the Pentagon, Rumsfeld said the  panel provided "important information and recommendations that  will be of assistance in our ongoing efforts to improve  detention operations."<p> 
			
			In addition, a separate Army investigation headed by Maj.  Gen. George Fay faulted Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, at the time  the top U.S. commander in Iraq, for leadership failures for not  addressing troubles at Abu Ghraib, a senior Army official said.  The Schlesinger panel, too, faulted Sanchez.<p> 
			
			The Fay report, to be released on Wednesday, found Sanchez  and his staff were preoccupied with combating an escalating  insurgency and did not focus on the festering problems at Abu  Ghraib, the Army official said.<p> 
			
			The report also found that Army military intelligence  soldiers kept a number of prisoners, dubbed "ghost detainees,"  off the books and hidden from the International Committee of  the Red Cross, the official added. It also found a small number  of military police used dogs to menace teen-age Abu Ghraib  detainees.<p> 
			
			Seven Army reservists from the 372nd Military Police  Company already have been charged with abusing prisoners at Abu  Ghraib. The Fay report implicates about two dozen more  low-ranking soldiers, medics and civilian contractors in the  Abu Ghraib abuse, and about half of them will be recommended  for criminal proceedings, the Army official said.<p> 
			
			"These are illegal, unauthorized, mischievous, sadistic  activities happening outside the purview of interrogations,"  the Army official said.<p> 
			
			But the Fay report maintains that the abuse was perpetrated  by a few soldiers, but went unchecked as a result of military  leadership deficiencies, the Army official said.<p> 
			
			White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters in  Crawford, Texas, "Remember, we said early on that it's  important that those who were responsible for the appalling  acts at Abu Ghraib are held accountable. And it's also  important to take a broad look and make sure that there are no  systemic problems."<p> 
			
			In Mannheim, Germany, a U.S. military judge ruled that  Rumsfeld could not be forced to testify in the court martial of  a sergeant charged in the abuse.<p>
