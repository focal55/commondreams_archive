<p>SAN FRANCISCO - With the news that members of a U.S. Army 
reserve platoon have been arrested in Iraq for refusing a ”suicide 
mission,” dissent among veterans of the U.S.-led campaign in that country 
continues to grow.
<p>The recent incident mirrors other stories of troops being sent on missions 
without proper equipment, and again raises the spectre of plummeting troop 
morale as the security situation in Iraq deteriorates and elections 
scheduled for January approach.
<p>Even as late as six months after the March 2003 U.S.-led attack, as many as 
51,000 U.S. soldiers and civilian administrators in Iraq had still not been 
properly equipped with body armour and other protective gear, according to 
the 'Washington Post'.
<p>Alerted to the situation, family members bought expensive flak jackets and 
other security gear and used international couriers to send it to the front 
lines.
<p>Speaking of the low rates of readiness of his ground forces due to 
inadequate combat and protective equipment, the senior U.S. commander on 
the ground in Iraq from mid-2003 to mid-2004 said, ”I cannot continue to 
support sustained combat operations with rates this low.”
<p>Lieutenant-General Ricardo Sanchez added that army units were, ”struggling 
just to maintain à relatively low readiness rates” for key combat systems, 
reported the Post'.
<p>The mother of Amber McClenny, who serves in the platoon that in mid-October 
refused orders to transport fuel through an area north of Baghdad where 
ambushes are known to occur, told the Associated Press her daughter called 
and told her, ”We had broken-down trucks, non-armoured vehicles and à we 
were carrying contaminated fuel. They are holding us against our will. We 
are now prisoners.”
<p>While a senior U.S. military official has said the unit had been ordered to 
carry out what is known as a maintenance stand-down and its soldiers are 
not under arrest, many Iraq veterans in the United States feel the incident 
is indicative of poor troop morale, which stems from the growing belief 
among soldiers that the war in Iraq is unjustified.
<p>Army National Guard member Sergeant Kelly Dougherty served for 10 months in 
Iraq at Tallil Air Base, near Nasiriya. ”The people in Iraq didn't have 
money or jobs and their cities were destitute,” said Dougherty, who worked 
escorting convoys and patrols.
<p>”I wondered how these people were functioning after they'd been through so 
much. They hadn't even rebuilt from the first Gulf War (in 1991).”
<p>During a phone interview Dougherty said her unit did not even have 
translators for the first nine months of the occupation and were thus 
unable to communicate with Iraqis while conducting security patrols.
<p>”I think it was definitely wrong to go into Iraq,” she added. ”I thought 
that before we went in and the intelligence is proving this now.”
<p>Like other soldiers who are beginning to speak out against the Bush 
administration, Dougherty has strong words about how the war was waged. 
”People say the president didn't lie -- but it's hard for me to believe 
that they truly thought the reasons they went in were true,” she said.
<p>”I think we were intentionally lied to in order to get the U.S. into Iraq, 
and the Bush administration seized this opportunity.” The president, she 
added, was also being dishonest about the dangers that soldiers would face 
when he did not provide them with the necessary armour and supplies.
<p>Another veteran of the war in Iraq is Corporal Alex Ryabov, who 
participated in the invasion of Iraq until May 9. ”What I realise after 
having been there is that it (the war) is such a huge waste of life on both 
sides,” he said in an interview.
<p>Ryabov also commented on U.S. Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld's 
statement in September that the 1,000 U.S. soldiers who have died in Iraq 
are just some of the victims of the ”war on terrorism.”
<p>”The reality is that Bush and Rumsfeld don't have family in the military, 
and they have never served. Each U.S. death in Iraq -- each of those people 
has family and friends, and you can't tell them that this is a small number.”
<p>Ryabov, who served as the ammunition chief for his Marine Corps unit, 
believes the administration should be held to account for the horrendous 
situation in Iraq. ”They should be impeached. They should be put on trial.”
<p>He also believes the administration is not doing enough to support Iraq war 
veterans.
<p>”When troops come home we need to have benefits and VA (U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs) support. There are a lot of people having problems with 
this and no support. My friends are coming back angry and screwed up and 
not getting any help.”
<p>According to the U.S. military, more than 7,500 soldiers have been injured 
in Iraq through Sep. 27. Of those, more than one-half did not return to 
action after 72 hours. But veterans' advocates say the Pentagon is not 
counting nearly 16,000 more soldiers evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan 
for ”non-combat causes,” according to United Press International (UPI).
<p>Another veteran who has served in the Middle East is Senior Airman Tim 
Goodrich. While serving two deployments at Prince Sultan Air Base for 
Operation Southern Watch, where he patrolled no-fly zones in southern Iraq 
during the build-up to the current war, ”that is when it first hit me that 
this was the wrong idea,” said Goodrich.
<p>”I was watching troop movements for Iraq going through our base between 
August and October of 2002 à army troop movements preparing to go to war 
with Iraq six months before the war,” he told IPS.
<p>Goodrich too is angry. ”I feel absolutely betrayed by this administration. 
I was brought up believing it was the most honourable thing to do to serve 
in the military. Now I've learned that it is not a glorious undertaking à 
and that our country isn't living up to the standards I believed it was -- 
that our foreign policy has been flawed for decades.”
<p>Goodrich feels so strongly about the horrendous situation in Iraq that he 
has joined a group called <a href="http://www.ivaw.net" target="_new">Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW)</a>. The 
organisation, which started two and a half years ago with only nine 
members, has now grown to over 60, including active duty service personnel 
in Iraq.
<p>In order to accommodate the growing numbers of Iraq veterans joining the 
group, IVAW is trying to obtain office space and find a part-time employee 
to assist in its mission of ending the occupation and seeing service 
members return to the United States.
<p>The group will also be sending members on speaking tours until the end of 
November, according to its website.
<p>Goodrich believes the situation in Iraq is the reason why the military has 
failed to meet its recruiting goals recently. And he applauded the platoon 
in Iraq for refusing to follow orders.
<p>”I think it's about time that someone stood up and did something. They are 
working with sub-par equipment that is putting peoples' lives at risk,” he 
said. ”There are not enough armoured vehicles and not enough supplies for 
the soldiers. One hundred fifty billion dollars (has been spent) to fund 
these guys and the money isn't getting to where it needs to be.”
<p>When asked what he would do if he were called up to serve in Iraq again, 
Goodrich replied, ”No comment.”
