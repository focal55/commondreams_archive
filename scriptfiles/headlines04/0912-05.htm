<p>WASHINGTON  - With its battle to kill the
decade-long U.S. ban on assault weapons won, the National Rifle
Association is now setting its sights on the Nov. 2
presidential and congressional elections.
<p>
 The 10-year ban on importing or manufacturing certain
military-style assault weapons expires on Monday because
Congress never renewed it.
<p>
 While many decried its expiration and polls showed a
majority of Americans supported the ban, few were ready to
engage in a major fight with the NRA, the powerful gun lobby
whose large financial war chest and committed 4-million
membership has made it a political power for years.
<p>
 "There's an enduring disconnect between public opinion and
public policy on the gun issue. The majority of voters support
stronger gun laws but for them the gun issue is not a No. 1 or
top-tier concern," said Robert Spitzer, a political scientist
at the State University of New York Cortland campus who
specializes in gun politics.
<p>
 "But for some of the NRA members, they are single-issue
voters, deeply committed to their cause. As a consequence, they
exert deep political force," he added.
<p>
The NRA, which generally supports Republicans, has not yet
formally endorsed President Bush's re-election bid.
 <p>
 But its Web site calls his Democratic opponent, John Kerry,
"the most anti-gun presidential nominee in United States
history" despite efforts to paint himself as a gun owner and
hunter.
 <p>
 NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said formal
endorsements would not come until Congress recessed next month,
but he did not hide his preferences for Bush's record on
firearms. Although Bush said in 2000 he would back extension of
the assault weapons ban, he never pushed for its passage and
has embraced other NRA policy priorities.
 <p>
 "It's pretty clear where gun owners that care about their
guns are going," LaPierre said in a telephone interview last
week. He said Kerry's efforts at portraying himself as a
sportsman showed the Democrat recognized his vulnerability.
 <p>
 "That gun in Kerry's hands says more than anything I can
say," LaPierre said. "He wouldn't be doing that if he didn't
realize it's make-or-break-it for a candidate out in the
heartland of the country."
 <p>
 Some analysts say Democrat Al Gore's narrow defeat in
several states with a large pro-gun electorate cost him the
2000 presidential election and that the Democrats lost control
of Congress in 1994 because of NRA campaigning against them.
 <p>
 'FAULTY LEGISLATION'
 <p>
 For years, many opinion polls have shown public support for
the assault weapons ban and some other gun control measures.
But politicians have been hesitant about crossing the NRA,
which can simultaneously mobilize grass-roots supporters and
work the halls of power in Washington and state capitals.
 <p>
 "They don't want to tick off the NRA -- especially if they
are in close races," said New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy, elected on a gun control platform after her husband
was slain in 1993 by a gunman on a commuter train.
 <p>
 Congress did pass the 10-year assault weapon ban in 1994
and President Bill Clinton signed it into law, but the NRA has
since made the death of what LaPierre called "faulty
legislation based on cosmetic nonsense" one of its top
priorities.
 <p>
 While its demise was a win for the NRA, the year has not
been all victories for the gun lobby. Another top priority, a
bill to limit civil lawsuits against the gun industry, passed
the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. NRA
allies killed it themselves after the Senate added to the bill
a renewal of the assault weapon ban.
 <p>
 Gun control has not been a key issue in a campaign
dominated by Iraq, terrorism, the economy, health care and the
legacy of Vietnam. But with the assault weapons ban in the
headlines and interest groups starting to advertise about guns,
it may reappear on more voters' radar screens, especially among
swing suburban voters in battleground states.
