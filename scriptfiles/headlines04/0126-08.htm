<p>LONDON  - 

For two years, courts did little to
interfere as Western governments took on sweeping new
anti-terror powers in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
But 2004 looks to be the year the judges have their say.

<!--/endimage/-->Governments are increasingly being forced to defend
policies that restrict long-established civil liberties --
above all the policy of holding defendants without charge.
<p>
 "There comes a time when you can't keep people locked up
forever," said Clive Walker, professor of criminal justice and
director of the law school at Britain's University of Leeds.
<p>
 "The judicial branch of the government, which laid down
supinely at the feet of the executive for a few months or a few
years, now appears to have come to its senses."
<p>
 A series of rulings in the United States, culminating with
a court judgment last month that authorities could not hold
U.S. citizen Jose Padilla indefinitely without charge, have
dealt setbacks to some of the most controversial anti-terror
tactics. The United States blames the 2001 hijack plane attacks
against Washington and New York, which killed some 2,800
people, on Osama Bin Laden's al Qaeda organization.
<p>
 And other countries also have contentious policies to
defend, such as Britain, where the authorities formally
abrogated from the European Convention on Human Rights to take
on the power to imprison foreign terror suspects indefinitely.
<p>
 TIDE TURNING IN U.S.
<p>
The first signs of a turning tide came when the U.S.
Supreme Court  decided it would rule on a clutch of high-profile
tests of the tough Bush administration policy.
 <p>
 "The court has rarely agreed to deal with so many of these
things because the usual feeling has been the executive gets
great deference in a national security crisis," said Robert
Levy, constitutional law expert at the Cato Institute, a
U.S.-based libertarian think tank.
 <p>
 "There is some indication that because the executive branch
has, I think, overreached, that finally we are getting some
intervention by the judiciary."
 <p>
 The issue that has most exasperated other countries is the
prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, where the U.S. military is
holding more than 600 "unlawful enemy combatants" without the
rights given prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.
 <p>
 In November, the Supreme Court agreed to rule in the next
year on whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction over the base,
potentially letting detainees raise cases about their
treatment.
 <p>
 The Bush administration's most controversial new powers
stem from its definition of prisoners as "combatants," allowing
the military to hold them outside the regular legal system.
 <p>
 The administration argues that the president, as commander
in chief, has the constitutional power to capture enemies
without interference from the courts.
 <p>
 For months, U.S. courts agreed. A federal appeals court in
Virginia decided in the case of Yasser Hamdi, one of two U.S.
citizens captured fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan, that
allowing judges to interfere in such cases would make it
impossible for the military to wage war.
 <p>
 "Judicial review does not disappear during wartime, but the
review of battlefield captures in overseas conflicts is a
highly deferential one," wrote Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson.
 <p>
 But instead of declaring the case settled, the Supreme
Court said this month that it will hear Hamdi's appeal.
<p>
 Rights lawyers accept that battlefield prisoners, such as
Hamdi -- captured in Afghanistan -- are combatants. But the
administration has gradually stretched the definition to cover
prisoners captured in other parts of the world, far from
theaters of conventional military operations.
<p>
In May 2002 the government applied the "enemy combatant"
label to Padilla, an American citizen arrested at Chicago's
O'Hare airport. Officials said he was planning to detonate a
radioactive bomb but did not charge him with a crime.
<p>
Last month, in a major setback to the administration, a
federal appeals court ordered the government to release Padilla
within 30 days or transfer him to civilian courts. The
government has asked the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.
<p>
In Britain, the government passed emergency legislation in
the wake of Sept. 11 that allowed it to hold foreign terror
suspects without charge. Authorities are using that power to
hold 14 foreigners, including Sheikh Abu Qatada, described as
one of the leading al Qaeda figures in Europe.
<p>
Britain's High Court ruled that the measure was legal, but
its Law Lords, the country's highest court, have decided to
consider an appeal on behalf of the detainees this year.
<p>
In a sharply worded report in December, a special panel of
senior members of parliament ruled that the entire anti-terror
law must be reviewed within six months and urged the government
to scrap the measures permitting detention without charge.
<p>
Courts have also dealt major setbacks to prosecutors in
Germany -- the only country so far to have convicted a suspect
on charges relating to the Sept. 11 attacks.
<p>
PREVENTING ATTACKS
<p>
Ultimately, how far courts roll back some anti-terror
policies may depend on whether there are more attacks.
<p>
Although militants thought to be linked to al Qaeda have
struck in such Muslim allies of the West as Indonesia, Saudi
Arabia and Turkey over the past two years, there has not been a
single major attack in the West itself since Sept. 11.
<p>
States argue that their additional powers are one of the
reasons behind their success at stopping new strikes. Charging
detainees with ordinary crimes would require authorities to
reveal evidence against them, potentially exposing
intelligence.
<p>
"Have (detentions) probably prevented attacks? Certainly
the security services think they have," said Kevin Rosser,
terrorism expert at consultancy Control Risks Group.
<p>
"I think it throws up a very great dilemma. On the one hand
nobody wants to see freedom and due process sacrificed. At the
same time, without access to the information that governments
possess, it is very difficult to arrive at a judgment about
whether abuses are taking place, and whether it's helping."
