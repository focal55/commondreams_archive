<p>WASHINGTON   - Guerrilla warfare in Iraq is putting  U.S. troops under growing mental stress as the military  struggles to retain and recruit soldiers, according to a study  cited by the Army Reserve commander on Thursday.<p> 
			
			"This is just very tough business," said Lt. Gen. James  Helmly, noting that military chores from driving supply trucks  to directing traffic in Iraq had become battlefield jobs  because of bombings and other growing attacks by insurgents.<p> 
			
			"Driving that truck is one of the most hazardous damned  occupations we have in Iraq," he said. "Truck drivers, frankly,  and MPs (military police) are front-line troops these days."<p> 
			
			He said the survey suggested that an unusually high  percentage of U.S. troops in support roles had been involved in  the fighting in Iraq, which has killed more than 1,000  Americans and thousands of Iraqis.<p> 
			
			"As you know, there is no more secure area," he said in an  interview with reporters, adding that the study of  psychological stress was conducted by the government and  involved troops from all the U.S. armed services.<p> 
			
			"I saw the results of an effort yesterday that surveyed  soldiers. And the statistics were astounding in terms of the  percentages of soldiers who have served in 'Iraqi Freedom' and  say, 'I have seen a fellow soldier seriously wounded,' 'I  observed a fellow soldier die,' 'I observed a civilian killed,'  'My location was subjected to mortar or rocket fire."'<p> 
			
			The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have put the all-volunteer  U.S. military under strain and sparked concern over the ability  to re-enlist troops, especially in part-time Reserve and  National Guard units called to duty to support regular forces.<p> 
			
			A KEY YEAR FOR RECRUITING<p> 
			
			Half of the 206,000 members of the Army Reserve have been  activated since the September 2001 attacks on America. About  38,500 are on active duty now.<p> 
			
			"While our end strength is solid and we will make our  recruiting goal this year of non-prior service enlistees ... it  is increasingly tough," Helmly said.<p> 
			
			The general spoke a day after the Government Accountability  Office, the investigative arm of Congress, released a study  warning that the Reserve and Guard could not sustain its  current rate of call-up indefinitely.<p> 
			
			The Pentagon limits the active duty time that can be served  by such part-time troops to 24 cumulative months.<p> 
			
			Helmly complained he felt constricted in the ability to  retain troops because, among other things, he had been refused  permission to pay re-enlistment bonuses to active Reserve  members.<p> 
			
			"Well, the logic escapes me," he said. "One does not wish  to attack a manning problem after the fact. It is too late."<p> 
			
			Meantime, the general said, the military is changing its  training of all Reserve and National Guard troops to make them  more prepared for combat, no matter what jobs they have.
<p> 
			
			"I tell chaplain's assistants: 'You are unprepared for the  battlefield. You must prepare yourself mentally and you must be  prepared to engage and kill an enemy in close combat."'
