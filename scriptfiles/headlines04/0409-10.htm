<p>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- Lane Anderson sees the ghosts of
fallen troops he knew in Vietnam when he gazes out at the sea of
white crosses that cover the sandy shore near Stearns Wharf.

The memorial, fondly dubbed ''Arlington West,'' goes up at
sunrise and down at sunset every Sunday to mark the rising death
toll in Iraq. This week, more crosses will be added to the mock
cemetery after the fierce fighting in Fallujah and Ramadi.
<p>   More than 30 years ago, Anderson made sense of his comrades'
deaths by telling himself the country had learned a lesson in
Vietnam.
<p>   But last Sunday, he couldn't help drawing parallels between that
conflict and the war in Iraq as he and more than a dozen volunteers
arranged with geometric precision each cross bearing the name,
rank, age and hometown of a fallen U.S. fighter.
<p>   ''I see a tragedy,'' Anderson said. ''I see Vietnam in its first
year. Even then, people kept saying once we started the war we had
to finish.''
<p>   Anderson and other volunteers from the Santa Barbara chapter of
  <a href="http://www.veteransforpeace.org/" target="_new">Veterans for Peace</a> first erected the crosses last November and
intend to continue the tribute until all the troops come home from
Iraq.
<p>   It started as a simple plan so people could see the cost of war,
said Stephen Sherrill, who conceived the idea and took it to the
veterans group.
<p>   ''Before, the casualties were just a number in the paper,''
Sherrill said. ''But I thought, when Americans see the price we are
paying, they will understand.''
<p>   The idea caught on quickly, inspiring similar tributes in Santa
Monica, Oceanside and Ann Arbor, Mich., with plans in the works for
a display in Maine, said David Cline, national president of St.
Louis-based <a href="http://www.veteransforpeace.org/" target="_new">Veterans for Peace</a>.
<p>   For many, the crosses are simply a way to honor the fallen
heroes who did their duty in Iraq.
<p>   ''Each of those are people, and they had so much to do in this
world,'' Vietnam veteran Sharon Lee Kufeldt said as she surveyed
the crosses in Santa Barbara. ''I am one of them. I wore my uniform
proudly, tears still run down my cheeks when I hear the songs.''

Sherrill, a semiretired building contractor and longtime
anti-war activist, hand-makes every cross. When he first started
about six months ago, there were close to 400. Last Sunday, there
were 605.
<p>   With ''Taps'' playing in the background, a steady stream of
tourists, merchants, veterans and locals paraded past the display.
<p>   Most stopped just long enough to scan a makeshift wall fashioned
out of cardboard and wooden slats that features the names and
pictures of every person killed. Some visitors lingered to take a
closer look. Volunteers invited some to select a name and put
flowers by their cross.
<p>   Nicole Soliman, 57, stopped at the edge of the memorial and
silently wept. She was surprised several weeks ago to learn how
many had been killed. The local resident now finds herself drawn
back to the growing display every week.
<p>   ''It's my little way of paying tribute,'' she said.
<p>   Passer-by Ray Sargent, 77, approved of the memorial but
disagreed with the anti-war message. Sargent, a Korean War veteran,
believes President Bush had reason to go to war.
<p>   ''I think you people are beautiful for doing this,'' he told a
volunteer. ''But we'll never know until history tells us whether
Bush was wrong or right.''
<p>   Chris Haskell, 45, respected the effort to honor the fallen
fighters but disagreed with using their deaths to make a political
statement.
<p>   ''How many lives were saved by our invasion of Iraq?'' he asked.
''How many people who were imprisoned under Saddam were saved?''
<p>   Stacy Menusa, 31, made a pilgrimage from Santa Maria with her
4-year-old son Joshua and other family members to see the cross of
her husband, Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Menusa   one of the first Marines
killed in Iraq.
<p>   The native of the Phillippines was granted U.S. citizenship
after he was killed in an Iraqi ambush.
<p>   His widow didn't see the politics of war or a protest when she
looked at the rows of white crosses.
<p>   ''I see heroes,'' she said.
