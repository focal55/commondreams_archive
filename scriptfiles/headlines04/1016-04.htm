<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 Brent Scowcroft, a mentor to the current national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, also said in an interview published in England that Bush is inordinately influenced by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "Sharon just has him wrapped around his little finger," Scowcroft told London's Financial Times. "I think the president is mesmerized."
 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Scowcroft said the Bush administration's "unilateralist" position was partly responsible for the post-Sept. 11, 2001, decline of the trans-Atlantic relationship. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "It's in general bad," he said. "It's not really hostile, but there's an edge to it."
 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Early on, he said, "We had gotten contemptuous of Europeans and their weaknesses. We had really turned unilateral."
 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Although slightly diminished since then, the unilateralist policies remain fundamentally little changed, Scowcroft said. Recent overtures to cooperate in Afghanistan and Iraq with the United Nations  and NATO were "as much an act of desperation as anything else ... to rescue a failing venture."
 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On Israel and Sharon, the former security adviser said Sharon calls Bush after strongly retaliating for a Palestinian suicide attack and says: "`I'm on the front line of terrorism,' and the president says, `Yes, you are.'"
 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Scowcroft said Sharon "has been nothing but trouble."
