<p>WASHINGTON   - President Bush's claim to lead an  international "coalition of the willing" in Iraq has been badly  dented by the result of the Spanish election, giving fresh  ammunition to anti-war voices at home and abroad.<p>

"This is a consequence of what we knew a year ago -- that  Bush tried to force governments to choose between their own  voters and the White House," said Tom Andrews, a former  Democratic congressman from Maine, now national director of <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/" target="_new">Win  Without War</a>, a grassroots anti-Iraq war group.
<p> 
			
"The White House tried to sweeten the pot for those  countries that joined the coalition but this was never a  coalition of the willing, as Bush claimed. It was a coalition  of the coerced and the purchased -- and now those leaders have  to face their own voters," he said.<p> 
			
			Clifford May, a former senior official with the Republican  National Committee, now with the Center for the Defense of  Democracies, said the Bush administration needed to try harder  to convince international public opinion that defeating U.S.  enemies in Iraq was vital in the "war on terrorism."<p> 
			
			"I don't think Bush's aim is to lead a coalition. His aim  is to defeat terrorism. The loss of Spain as a partner is a  substantial loss. But even if we have to fight terrorism alone,  we have no choice but to fight," May said.<p> 
			
			"The people of Spain had every right to get rid of their  government and I also have every right to say that they have  made a terrible mistake and handed the terrorists a major  victory," he said.<p> 
			
			Administration officials have long argued that the United  States had wide international backing for the invasion, despite  failure to win U.N. approval.<p> 
			
			'COALITION OF THE WILLING'<p> 
			
			In November 2002, four months before the invasion, Bush  said that if then-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein refused to  give up his weapons, the United States would lead a "coalition  of the willing to disarm him."<p> 
			
			Last weekend, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Bush  had cemented "one of the largest coalitions in the history of  mankind, some 90 nations, for the global war on terror."<p> 
			
			But several governments that backed Bush, including Spain,  Britain and Italy, did so in the face of public opinion that  was hostile to the war.<p> 
			
			Now, three days after a series of train bombings killed 200  people, Spanish voters have thrown out a pro-Bush government  and replaced it with one committed to withdrawing Spain's 1,300  troops from Iraq.<p> 
			
			The issue of how best to establish international leadership  in the "war on terrorism" is likely to become a key issue in  the U.S. presidential election.<p> 
			
			Even before the Spanish election, Democratic nominee John  Kerry was arguing that Bush's strategy against Osama bin  Laden's al Qaeda organization was flawed, a theme he returned  to in a speech on Monday.<p> 
			
			"He (Bush) has pushed away our allies at a time when we  need them the most," the Massachusetts senator said. "He hasn't  pursued a strategy to win the hearts and minds of people around  the world and win the war of ideas against the radical ideology  of Osama bin Laden."<p> 
			
			A key question now is how other U.S. allies react to he  Spanish result. So far, all of the countries with soldiers in  Iraq have vowed to keep them there. But the election showed  that leaders and governments facing hostile voters could  eventually pay a heavy political price.<p> 
			
			"Why did the train bombings have the effect that they did?  Because 90 percent of the Spanish people did not want this war  in the first place and were unwilling to pay any price for what  they saw as a mistaken policy," said University of Chicago  political scientist Robert Pape.<p> 
			
			"What does this mean for the rest of our allies? The  Italians? The British? They, and some of us as well, may well  conclude that the war against Iraq has made us more vulnerable  and not less," he said.
