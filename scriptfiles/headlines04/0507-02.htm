<p>ANTIOCH, California   - Three U.S. military  policemen who served at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison said on  Thursday they had witnessed unreported cases of prisoner abuse  and that the practice against Iraqis was commonplace.<p> 
			
			"It is a common thing to abuse prisoners," said Sgt. Mike  Sindar, 25, a National Guardsman with the 870th Military Police  Company based in the San Francisco Bay area. "I saw beatings  all the time.<p> 
			
			"A lot of people had so much pent-up anger, so much  aggression."<p> 
			
			U.S. treatment of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib has stirred  wide international condemnation after the publication of photos  in recent days showing Americans sexually humiliating  prisoners. Six soldiers in Iraq have been charged in the case  and President Bush apologized publicly on Thursday.<p> 
			
			Although public attention has focused on the dehumanizing  photos, some members of the 870th MP unit say the faces in  those images were far from the only ones engaged in cruel  behavior.<p> 
			
			"It was not just these six people," Sindar, who shaves his  head and wears a large tattoo on his forearm, told Reuters.  "Yes, the beatings happen, yes, all the time."<p> 
			
			Ramone Leal, 25, said one female soldier in his unit fired  off a slingshot into a crowd of prisoners, injuring one.  Another group of soldiers knocked a 14-year-old boy to the  ground as he arrived at the prison and then twisted his arm.<p> 
			
			"The soldiers were laughing at him," said Leal, who like  the others interviewed for this article has since returned to  California. "I saw the other soldiers that would take out their  frustrations on the prisoners."<p> 
			
			Until earlier this year prisoners would arrive at Abu  Ghraib with broken bones, suggesting they had been roughed up,  he said, but the practice ended in January or February.<p> 
			
			A sergeant in their group was admonished last year after  holding down a prisoner for other men to beat, both Leal and  Sindar said. They said they saw hooded prisoners with racial  taunts written on the hoods such as "camel jockey' or slogans  such as "I tried to kill an American but now I'm in jail."<p> 
			
			Photos obtained by Reuters show U.S. soldiers looking into  body bags of three Iraqi prisoners killed by 870th MP guards  during a prison riot in the fall of 2003. One photograph shows  a bearded man with much of his bloodied forehead removed by the  force of a bullet.<p> 
			
			"We were constantly being attacked, we had terrible support  ... also being extended all the time, a lot of us had problems  with our loved ones suffering from depression," said MP Dave  Bischell. "It all contributes to the psychological component of  soldiers when they get stressed."<p> 
			
			When military investigators were looking into abuses  several months ago, they gave U.S. guards a week's notice  before inspecting their possessions, several soldiers said.<p> 
			
			"That shows you how lax they are about discipline. 'We are  going to look for contraband in here, so hint, hint, get rid of  the stuff,' that's the way things work in the Guard," Leal  said.
