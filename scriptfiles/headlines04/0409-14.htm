<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq - In a split between U.S.-picked Iraqi leaders and American administrators, the Governing Council demanded an immediate cease-fire across the country Friday and a halt to military operations that punish civilians.</p>
    <p>A Shiite member of the council also met with radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose militia is battling U.S.-led forces in the south, and announced he was suspending his membership in the Iraqi Governing Council until the "bleeding in all Iraq" ends.</p>
    <p>Another member, Ghazi al-Yawer, threatened to quit the council over the Marines' bloody siege of the city of Fallujah, aimed at uprooting Sunni insurgents.</p>
    <p>U.S. forces have been fighting a two-front battle this week - against Sunni militants in Fallujah and al-Sadr's militia in the south - that has killed more than 460 Iraqis and 45 Americans.</p>
    <p>Friday's halt in the Fallujah assault was requested by the council to allow for talks on reducing the violence, U.S. coalition spokesman Dan Senor said.</p>
    <p>But a top commander, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt insisted the talks "are not negotiations."</p>
    <p>Al-Yawer, a Sunni member of the council, and the representative of another Sunni member met Friday with city leaders in talks at a Marine base outside Fallujah, council member Mahmoud Othman told The Associated Press.</p>
    <p>Al-Yawer said that while he has not taken any formal steps, "I will quit (the council) if the problem is not solved peacefully, because God will not bless a position of power that does not benefit its people."</p>
    <p>"If negotiations fail because of the stubbornness of the American side or the failure to adhere to a cease-fire, I will quit 100 percent," he told Al-Jazeera TV.</p>
    <p>The council's request for negotiations pointed to the eagerness of the Iraqi leaders to distance themselves from the assault, which has angered many Iraqis and become for some a symbol of resistance against the Americans.</p>
    <p>In a statement issued early Saturday, the council demanded "an immediate cease fire" and political solutions for the "situations around the country, particularly in Fallujah."</p>
    <p>It also called for an end to the "military solution" and "collective punishment that falls on innocent civilians" - a reference to the Fallujah siege.</p>
    <p>It denounced terrorism and noted that "no one is above the law" - a reference to activitied by both Sunni and Shiite insurgents</p>
    <p>Shiite council member Abdul-Karim Mahoud al-Mohammedawi met Friday with al-Sadr, the cleric U.S. commanders have vowed to capture.</p>
    <p>"I will not go back to the council until we enter a constructive discussion about Iraq ... to achieve what the Iraqi people really want and to stop the bleeding in all Iraq," he told reporters outside al-Sadr's office in Najaf.</p>
    <p>"I call on everybody to use the voice of wisdom and avoid violence," he said.</p>
    <p>One of the strongest pro-U.S. voices on the council, Adnan Pachachi, denounced the U.S. siege, launched after Sunni insurgents killed four U.S. contract workers and a mob dragged their burned and mutilated bodies through the streets and hung two of them from a bridge.</p>
    <p>"These (U.S.) operations were a mass punishment for the people of Fallujah," Pachachi told Al-Arabiya TV. "It was not right to punish all the people of Fallujah and we consider these operations by the Americans unacceptable and illegal."</p>
    <p>Added al-Yawer: "We all agree that those who did that (killed the four Americans) were criminals who deserve to be arrested. But the result was the mass punishment of a city. ... And that we refuse."</p>
    <p>Asked about the council members' criticism, Senor said U.S.. forces have "a responsibility to address a situation that is hostile."</p>
    <p>He said the coalition cannot "just turn our heads and look the other way" when Americans are killed in Fallujah.</i></p>
