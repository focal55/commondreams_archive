<p>LOS ANGELES  - 

Animal welfare groups on Thursday
threatened to sue the U.S. Navy over the use of mid-frequency
sonar linked to mass whale strandings, internal bleeding and
death.
<p>
 The <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/" target="_new">National Resources Defense Council</a> and a coalition of
three other environmental groups sent a letter on Wednesday to
Navy Secretary Gordon England saying they would go to court
unless the Navy agreed to curb the practice.
<p>
 The coalition says that mid-frequency, high intensity sonar
systems used on 60 percent of Navy ships and submarines to
detect enemy submarines interferes with the ability of marine
mammals to navigate, find food, avoid predators and communicate
with each other.
<p>
 "Without reasonable limits, the proliferation of high
intensity sonar will cause excruciating pain, injury and death
for an increasing number of marine mammals," said Frederick
O'Regan, president of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare.
<p>
 A Navy spokesman in Washington D.C. said the letter would
be "carefully reviewed and considered" and noted that the Navy
already has several programs aimed at protecting marine
mammals.
<p>
 The letter was prompted by what the coalition called a
stampede of about 200 melon-headed whales during a
U.S.-Japanese naval training exercise off the coast of the
Hawaiian island of Kauai two weeks ago.
<p>
 The pod of normally deep-water whales crowded into shallow
waters near the shore in such chaos that one of the whales
stranded and died. The warships shut off their sonar on
learning of the stampede but the coalition said the exact
sequence of events was unclear.
<p>
 The letter cited 10 cases of mass stranding and whale
deaths associated with mid-frequency sonar in the last nine
years in places ranging from Greece to the Canary Islands.
<p>
 Citing the journal Nature, the coalition said that intense
sonar blasts can give marine mammals decompression sickness
similar to "the bends" sometimes experienced by surfacing
divers. Post-mortem examinations on some whales exposed to
sonar showed hemorrhaging around the ears and the larynx.
<p>
 Last year the Navy agreed to scale back the use of a
different kind of sonar system using low-frequency waves after
losing a lawsuit brought by the coalition under endangered
species and marine mammal protection legislation.
<p>
 The coalition said the Navy's use of mid-frequency sonar
violated the same laws but on a much larger scale. "We'd rather
not resort to litigation so we are once again asking the Navy
to sit down to discuss this in a spirit of co-operation," said
NRDC lawyer Joel Reynolds.
