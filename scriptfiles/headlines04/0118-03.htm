<p>Some 25 people were killed and some 130 wounded in a suicide blast outside coalition headquarters in Baghdad in the boldest assault yet on the symbol of US power in Iraq and a blow to Washington's plans to seek the United Nations' return to the country.</p>
<p>Most of the dead were Iraqis but they included at least two Americans, US military officials said, after a white pick-up truck, crammed with more than 1,000 pounds (500 kilos) of explosives, detonated near the Assassin's Gate checkpoint crowded with people and cars waiting to enter the walled compound.</p>

<!--/endimage/-->The huge explosion turned the busy central Baghdad street outside into a battlefield inferno but the headquarters buildings inside the heavily-fortified area known as the Green Zone were unaffected.</p>
<p>The blast came the day before Iraqi and US officials, including US civilian administrator Paul Bremer, are to meet with a wary UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York to discuss a future UN role in Iraq.</p>
<p>"At least 20 people have lost their lives and almost 60 were injured," US Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt told reporters.</p>
<p>"It would appear from all the indicators this was a suicide bomb. We have confirmation some of those killed were US citizens, US contractors. We believe the current number is two. We are waiting for final confirmation," Kimmitt said.</p>
<p>Another five people were reported dead and 71 wounded at Baghdad hospitals.</p>
<p>Witnesses claimed US soldiers opened fire in panic on Iraqis moments after the blast, but a military spokesman denied this.</p>
<p>"Today's terrorist bombing in Baghdad ... is an outrage -- another clear indication of the murderous and cynical intent of terrorists to undermine freedom, democracy and progress in Iraq," Bremer said in a statement posted on the website of the US-led coalition.</p>
<p>"They will not succeed," he vowed.</p>
<p>Iraqi police chief General Ahmed Ibrahim said, "This is an act of terrorism carried out by foreign groups. This is against Islam. They did not strike the might of the coalition because the majority of victims are Iraqis."</p>
<p>"If the terrorists think that this is the way to return the Baath party (of ousted president Saddam Hussein) to power, they are deluded," Ibrahim said.</p>
<p>The US spokesman said the vehicle exploded 100 metres (yards) from the checkpoint outside the fortress-like headquarters, a former palace of Saddam.</p>
<p>A confirmed death toll of 25 would make it the heaviest single attack in Baghdad since the end of major combat in Iraq on May 1, though 43 people were killed in a series of blasts in the capital last October 27.</p>
<p>A total of 22 people, including the top UN envoy, were killed in a truck-bombing of the UN headquarters on August 19.</p>
<p>This and other attacks against UN and aid agencies prompted Annan to eventually pull out his international staff from Iraq, and the timing of the latest carnage could not be worse as far as the coalition is concerned.</p>
<p>The United States wants the UN to return to Iraq to help prevent its power transfer plans from being wrecked by mounting Iraqi opposition. </p>
<p>Annan requested Monday's meeting in mid-December to get "clarity" on what the world body would be expected to do as the coalition prepares to formally end its occupation and Iraqis begin governing themselves on July 1.</p>
<p>But the talks have taken on new urgency for Washington in the wake of opposition from the spiritual leader of Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who has rejected plans for the handover.</p>
<p>Sistani wants the democracy that the coalition promised after the war to oust Saddam, and says direct elections must be held instead of the caucus system now being prepared to create a provisional government by end June.</p>
<p>He has already drawn tens of thousands of supporters onto the streets to protest putting an unelected government in power, and has threatened strikes and civil disobedience if the United States does not relent.</p>
<p>Bremer said Friday that Washington would consider some "refinements" to the plan, which was originally spelled out in a November 15 agreement between the Governing Council and the coalition.</p>
<p>That deal made no mention of the United Nations.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the main Shiite party, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, said SCIRI leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a Governing Council member, would use the talks to press Sistani's request.</p>
<p>He said Sistani would back down only if a UN fact-finding team "officially concludes" that free and fair elections are impossible in the short term, which Annan has indicated he believes.</p>
<p>In other attacks on the coalition Sunday, two British soldiers suffered minor injuries in an explosion in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, the British defense ministry said in London.</p>
<p>The troops were on routine patrol in the southwest of Iraq's second city when a small explosive device detonated at the side of the road at about 9:00 am (0600 GMT), a spokesman said.</p>
<p>In Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, two Iraqis were killed and a third wounded late Saturday when an explosive device they were handling went off in their car, a US military commander said.</p>
<p>Japanese armored vehicles and firearms were meanwhile shipped into Kuwait for use by an advance unit of 39 ground troops now in the emirate to prepare for humanitarian operations into Iraq.</p>
<p>The equipment was taken to Camp Virginia, a US military camp in the Kuwaiti desert, where the Japanese ground troops are staying before moving into Iraq to begin their mission.</p>
<p>The advance unit will prepare for the deployment of a 600-strong force inside the southeastern Iraqi province of Muthanna to engage in non-combat operations.
