<p>KIEV  - Ukraine's political crisis appeared to  ease on Wednesday when both presidential candidates in a  disputed election offered ways out of their bitter feud that  has taken the country to the brink of violent conflict.
<p> 
			
			Liberal contender Viktor Yushchenko, who brought tens of  thousands of supporters onto the streets after alleging he had  been robbed of victory last Sunday by mass cheating, said he  was now ready to take part in a new "honest" poll.<p>

Moscow-backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich was, as  expected, formally declared the winner by electoral  authorities.<p> 
			
			But earlier, he hinted that he too was open to compromise  saying he was not interested in official results that handed  him a "fictitious victory."<p> 
			
			The signs of a compromise emerged as the United States, the  European Union and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance all  urged authorities to review the conduct of last Sunday's  run-off which most western powers have said was fraudulently  conducted.<p> 
			
			Even Russian President Vladimir Putin, who quickly  congratulated Yanukovich when it was clear he was winning,  looked ready to see an end to the crisis in its ex-Soviet ally.<p> 
			
			The Kremlin said that Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard  Schroeder agreed, in a telephone conversation, that Ukraine  should solve its crisis through legal means.<p> 
			
			Though compromise was in the air, the central electoral  commission went ahead with a rowdy session at which it declared  that Yanukovich had won 49.46 per cent of the vote to 46.61  percent for Yushchenko.<p> 
			
			Yushchenko's comments provided outgoing President Leonid  Kuchma with a way to defuse the crisis that has convulsed the  state of 47 million since early on Monday.<p> 
			
			"We are ready to have a repeat of the second round vote  provided we have an honest Central Election Commission,"  Yushchenko told tens of thousands of supporters massed in  Kiev's main square.<p> 
			
			ROBBED OF VICTORY<p> 
			
			Yushchenko, a former prime minister who narrowly won the  first round and was put well ahead of Yanukovich in an exit  poll, says he was robbed of victory by large-scale cheating.<p> 
			
			His allegations sparked mass unrest in Kiev and other  Yushchenko strongholds in western Ukraine, bringing tens of  thousands out onto the streets, paralyzing normal life.<p> 
			
			Yushchenko supporters roamed Kiev for a third day, marching  past buildings housing the presidency, government and  parliament and chanting: "Yushchenko! Yushchenko!"<p> 
			
			The United States and the European Union have all condemned  the election as a fraudulent exercise.<p> 
			
			There was no immediate reaction from Kuchma.<p> 
			
			But, within seconds of Yushchenko's offer, Yanukovich said  in a statement: "I need no fictitious victory, a result which  could lead to violence and victims. No position of authority,  no matter how important, is worth a single human life."<p> 
			
			Late on Tuesday, Kuchma called for talks with all parties  to solve the election row, but dismissed the opposition  protests as a "political farce."<p> 
			
			He has not been seen since the eve of the poll and  Yushchenko supporters have made much of his public absence.<p> 
			
			Yushchenko stressed that any new election would have to be  run under tighter electoral rules, particularly regarding  absentee ballots, seen as an area open to most abuse.<p> 
			
			Repeating his warning of civil conflict, he told his  cheering supporters: "This was not provoked by you or by the  opposition. It was done by the authorities.<p> 
			
			"But to find a resolution of the conflict does not mean  accepting falsified elections. We will never agree to that."<p> 
			
			EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana also warned that  Ukraine was at a crossroads and could slide into violence.<p> 
			
			The two rivals stand for different images for the future of  Ukraine, where the average worker earns just $60 a month.<p> 
			
			Yanukovich sees future prosperity in closer ties with  Russia. Yushchenko favors gradual integration with western  Europe but recognizes Russia as a strategic partner.<p> 
			
			The crisis has raised tension between the United States and  Russia, battling for influence over the ex-Soviet state.<p> 
			
			Nationalist western Ukraine, like Kiev, has taken a strong  pro-Yushchenko line. But the mood of near-revolution seen in  Kiev was markedly different from that in Russian-speaking  regions that heavily back Yanukovich.
			<p> 
			
			In Donetsk, a big coal-mining center, slogans were pinned  to fences denouncing Yushchenko as a traitor. Protests  supporting Yanukovich were being held in pits and factories.  Miners were trying to get to Kiev to counter opposition  rallies.
