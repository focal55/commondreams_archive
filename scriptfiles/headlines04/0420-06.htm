CAIRO  - When the king of Jordan postponed this week's meeting with President Bush, the snub revealed only a fraction of the humiliation felt by Washington's Arab friends. 
<p>
 Constrained by protocol and unwilling to burn bridges with
the most powerful country in the world, Arab leaders like King
Abdullah can only hint at the dismay they felt when Bush
changed U.S. policy last week, diplomats and analysts say.
<p>
 The blow was particularly hard for Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who met Bush on April 12 and was still in the United
States two days later when Bush gave two key and sensitive
concessions to visiting Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
<p>
 "They are very much upset. Bush is striking at the hearts
of their people and this makes King Abdullah and Mubarak really
angry," said an Arab ambassador, who asked not to be
identified.
<p>
 "They are embarrassed and humiliated in front of their own
people. Bush is playing with fire," said another Arab diplomat.
<p>
 Diplomats said Middle East leaders previously close to
Washington had few cards to play against the United States and
would probably swallow their pride at least until the U.S.
presidential election in November.
<p>
 Bush, apparently to help Sharon win domestic support for
his Gaza withdrawal plan, said that Israel could keep some West
Bank land and that Palestinian refugees should not expect to
reclaim their homes in what is now Israel.
<p>
 Coupled with the U.S. occupation of Iraq, which Arabs
increasingly associate with Israel's occupation of Palestinian
territories, the concessions were political dynamite.
<p>
 "I'm sure he (Mubarak) feels wounded because it seems like
a big cheat. It's a slap on the back of the neck -- the most
humiliating thing in our culture," said analyst Mohamed
al-Sayed Said of the al-Ahram Center in Cairo.
<p>
 Mubarak told the Houston Chronicle last week he was shocked
by Bush's promises to Sharon. He told the French newspaper Le
Monde this week the Americans had never before been so detested
in the Arab world.
<p>
 "They (Arabs) see Sharon acting as he pleases, without the
Americans telling him anything whatsoever," he added.
<p>
 The Jordanian government has been more circumspect. The
Jordanian embassy in Washington said the meeting with Bush was
postponed "to clarify the U.S. position regarding final status
issues, especially in light of recent (U.S.) statements."
<p>
 'COMPLETE BIAS'
<p>
 But a pro-government member of the Jordanian parliament,
Mahmoud al-Kharabsheh, said Jordan could not remain silent
despite its historic friendship with the United States.
<p>
 "This is an expression of dissatisfaction and anger over
U.S. policy as a whole and even if Jordan is an ally of
Washington the kingdom cannot accept this complete bias toward
Israel," Kharabsheh added.
<p>
 The discontent has spilled into Iraq, which might have been
preoccupied with its own domestic conflicts.
<p>
 Samir Sumaidy, Iraq's new interior minister and a former
member of the Iraqi Governing Council, said the direction U.S.
policy was taking on the Middle East was making it harder for
Arab leaders everywhere.
<p>
 "The developments and events which are taking place in
Palestine are complicating our problems here in Iraq," he said.
<p>
Arab commentators have called a Bush letter to Sharon last
week a new Balfour Declaration -- a reference to the British
promise in 1917 to allow a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
<p>
The declaration, written by then British Foreign Secretary
Arthur Balfour, lingers in the memory of Arabs and Muslims as a
symbol of colonial powers giving away another people's land.
<p>
"The Balfour Declaration is a deep scar in our psyche. If
someone like me is angry, imagine what it does to religious
people and the fundamentalists," said Mohamed al-Sayed Said.
<p>
Bush's new position has had domestic implications in Egypt
and Jordan, where Israel's assassination in Gaza of Hamas
leader Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi last week led to popular
demonstrations against Israel and the United States.
<p>
Diplomats said the impact would be rather less in Saudi
Arabia, Washington's other major friend in the Arab world, but
Bush's position would not help the Saudi government stamp out
violent opposition or quell increasingly vocal dissidents. JW
