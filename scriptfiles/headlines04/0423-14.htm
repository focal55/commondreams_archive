WASHINGTON -- The number of American troops wounded in Iraq
soared in the past two weeks as the insurgency flared in
south-central Iraq and in the Sunni Triangle north and west of
Baghdad.
<p>   The Pentagon announced Friday in its weekly casualty report that
3,864 troops have been wounded in action since the war began in
March 2003, an increase of 595 from two weeks earlier.
<p>   The U.S. military death toll as of Friday stood at 707,
according to the Pentagon's count. At least 100 have been killed
this month, the highest total for any month since the U.S.-led
invasion began. Most deaths were in the early part of April; about
25 have died in the past two weeks.
<p>   The Pentagon has announced the identities of 99 of those killed
this month. It does not identify the wounded.
<p>   As the toll on U.S. forces has mounted this month, most public
attention has focused on the deaths. Less has been reported on the
wounded, in part because the Pentagon has stopped providing daily
updates and does not give details on the types or severity of
wounds.
<p>   The only distinction the Pentagon makes in its public reports is
between the number of wounded who are returned to duty within three
days and those who are not. In the past two weeks, the number of
wounded who returned to duty rose by 257 and the number who did not
rose by 338.
<p>   The number wounded since April 1 is approaching 900, far beyond
the 200-300 wounded in most other months of the conflict. In March
291 were wounded in action. The highest monthly total before April
was 413 in October 2003, according to the Pentagon's Directorate
for Information Operations and Reports.
<p>   The Pentagon's figures do not include troops who are injured in
accidents or felled by illness.
<p>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday that
regardless of how well U.S. troops may be trained, the kind of
conflict they are fighting in Iraq is bound to take a heavy toll.
He singled out the Marines, saying they consider themselves
well-trained to fight in urban areas; Marines have been fighting
recently in and around the city of Fallujah.
<p>   ''It doesn't mean that you're going to be able to live through
that in a perfect way without people being killed or without people
being wounded, and the tragedy of the reality we live in is that
that's happening,'' he said.
<p>   Some of the more seriously wounded are treated at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center in Washington and at the Army's Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center in Germany, the largest U.S. hospital
abroad.
<p>   In its most recent report, Walter Reed said it had received 33
new battle casualties from Iraq last week. All arrived on medical
evacuation flights from Landstuhl. Walter Reed has treated 2,976
patients from the Iraq war since March 2003, of which 585 were
listed as battle casualties.
<p>   Many of the U.S. combat wounds have been inflicted by homemade
bombs, which the military calls improvised explosive devices and
which often are hidden along roadways used by U.S. military
convoys.
<p>   Since the insurgency intensified, starting March 31, many of the
wounds have come in gunfights, particularly in and around the
cities of Fallujah and Ramadi in the volatile Sunni Triangle.
Insurgents fire rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and small arms.
<p>   By far most of the battle wounds have happened since President
Bush declared an end to major combat operations on May 1. Since
that date there have been more than 2,700 wounded in action, of
which 109 were females and more than half were lower-ranking
enlisted soldiers.
<p>   According to a Pentagon breakdown by age group, 579 troops aged
21 and below were wounded between May 1 and April 8, the latest
date for which such figures are publicly available. A total of 669
troops were aged 22-24; 703 were aged 25-30; 353 were aged 31-35,
and 327 were over 35. The Pentagon said ages were not yet available
for 104 of the wounded.
