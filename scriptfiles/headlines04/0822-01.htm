<p>CARACAS, Venezuela - 

Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez told his opponents on Sunday they should not fear his
left-wing "revolution" after his referendum win and pledged to
respect private wealth and fight corruption.

  <p>
 While he offered a dialogue to foes who accepted his
victory in the Aug. 15 recall poll, Chavez said he would ignore
opposition leaders who refused to recognize his mandate and
urged other Latin American leaders to ostracize them as well.
 <p>
 In a television broadcast, the populist leader sought to
dispel fears among rich and middle-class Venezuelans that he
planned to launch a fresh ideological offensive against their
status and property.
 <p>
 "What we want is national unity ... this revolution should
not frighten anybody," Chavez said during his weekly "Hello
President" TV and radio show.
 <p>
 Opposition leaders say Chavez won the recall vote through
fraud by rigging voting machines, but international observers
found no evidence of cheating.
 <p>
 Venezuela has remained calm through the referendum, but
some opposition leaders have called for protests. This has
raised concerns of renewed conflict in the world's No. 5 oil
exporter, which has been bitterly divided over Chavez's rule.
 <p>
 First elected in 1998, Chavez won 59 percent of the
referendum vote and will now serve until 2006 elections.
 <p>
 "All this stuff about Chavez and his hordes coming to sweep
away the rich, it's a lie," he said. "We have no plan to hurt
you. All your rights are guaranteed, you who have large
properties or luxury farms or cars."
 <p>
 But he pledged to intensify social programs for the poor
and proceed with reforms of Venezuela's Supreme Court and
judiciary that critics say are squandering the country's oil
resources and seek to consolidate his personal grip on power.
 <p>
 He also vowed to "fight to the death against corruption."
 <p>
 "GO TO MARS"
 <p>
 Chavez said he would no longer deal with the opposition
Democratic Coordinator coalition, which promoted the referendum
challenge and now refuses to accept his win.
 <p>
 "We cannot talk with people who don't recognize this result
or the constitution ... if they want to start a rebellion in
the mountains, then let them," said Chavez, who himself led a
failed coup bid six years before winning 1998 elections.
 <p>
 He suggested these opposition leaders fly "to Mars or
Venus" to find support for their fraud charges.
 <p>
 Chavez said the Democratic Coordinator group, which he
accuses of backing a short-lived 2002 coup, should face
sanctions in the Organization of American States for what he
called their anti-democratic attitude.
 <p>
 He added he would lobby other South American presidents to
cut all contacts with the opposition coalition.
 <p>
 Chavez also appointed Jesse Chacon, a close political ally
and former military colleague, as interior minister.


<p>
 Chacon replaced Gen. Lucas Rincon, who was made interior
minister early last year when Chavez was battling a grueling
opposition strike.
<p>
Chavez also named Andres Izarra, a journalist who was press
attache at Venezuela's embassy in Washington, as information
minister.
