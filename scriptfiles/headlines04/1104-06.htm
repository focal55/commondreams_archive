      <p>OTTAWA - Disgruntled Democrats seeking a safe Canadian haven after President 
        Bush won Tuesday's election should not pack their bags just yet. 
      <p>
 Canadian officials made clear on Wednesday that any U.S.
citizens so fed up with Bush that they want to make a fresh
start up north would have to stand in line like any other
would-be immigrants -- a wait that can take up to a year.
 <p>
 "Let me tell you -- if they're hard-working honest people,
there's a process, and let them apply," Immigration Minister
Judy Sgro told Reuters.
 <p>
 Asked whether American applicants would get special
treatment, she replied: "No, they'll join the crowd like all
the other people who want to come to Canada."
 <p>
 There are anywhere from 600,000 to a million Americans
living in Canada, which leans more to the left than the United
States and has traditionally favored the Democrats over the
Republicans.
 <p>
 But statistics show a gradual decline in U.S. citizens
coming to work and live in Canada, which has an ailing health
care system and relatively high levels of personal taxation.
 <p>

 Government officials, real estate brokers and Democrat
activists said that while some Americans might talk about
moving to Canada rather than living with a new Bush
administration, they did not expect a mass influx.
 <p>
 "It's one thing to say 'I'm leaving for Canada' and quite
another to actually find a job here and wonder about where
you're going to live and where the children are going to go to
school," said one official.
 <p>
 Roger King of the Toronto-based Democrats Abroad group said
he had heard nothing about a possible exodus of party members.
 <p>
 "I imagine most committed Democrats will want to stay in
the United States and continue being politically active there,"
he said.
 <p>
 Americans seeking to immigrate can apply to become
permanent citizens of Canada, a process that often takes a
year. Becoming a full citizen takes a further three years.
 <p>
 The other main way to move north on a long-term basis is to
find a job, which in all cases requires a work permit. This
takes from four to six months to come through.
 <p>
 Statistics show the number of U.S. workers entering Canada
dropped to 15,789 in 2002 from 21,627 in 2000. In 1981 some
10,030 Americans gained permanent residency, compared to 5,541
in 2003.
 <p>

 Asked if there had been signs of increased U.S. interest,
Sgro said: "Not yet, but we'll see tomorrow."
 <p>
 The Canadian foreign ministry said there had been no
increase in hits on the Washington embassy's immigration Web
site, while housing brokers doubted they would see a surge in
U.S. business.
 <p>
 "Canada's always open and welcoming to Americans who want
to relocate here, but we don't think it would be a trend or
movement," said Gino Romanese of Royal Lepage Residential Real
Estate Services.
      <p> Those wishing to move to Canada could always take a risk and claim refugee 
        status -- the path chosen earlier this year by two U.S. deserters who 
        opposed the Iraq war. 
      <p>
 "Anybody who enters Canada who claims refugee status will
be provided with a work permit...it doesn't matter what country
they're from," said an immigration ministry spokeswoman.
<p>
Refugee cases are handled by special boards, which can take
months to decide whether to admit applicants. The rulings can
be appealed and opposition politicians complain some people
ordered deported have been in Canada for 10 years or more.
