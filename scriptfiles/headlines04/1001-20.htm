<P>ROME - An Italian aid worker held hostage last  month in Iraq said guerrillas there were right to fight  U.S.-led forces and their Iraqi "puppet government."
<P>
In comments that were bound to annoy Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi's government, Simona Torretta also called on Rome to  withdraw the troops it sent to Iraq to support its U.S. ally.
<P>
"I said it before the kidnapping and I repeat it today,"  she told Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview  published Friday.
<P>
"You have to distinguish between terrorism and resistance.  The guerrilla war is justified, but I am against the kidnapping  of civilians."
<P>
Torretta and her Italian colleague Simona Pari, both of  them 29, were freed Tuesday, three weeks after being snatched  from their Baghdad office. Berlusconi has brushed aside  widespread reports that his government paid a ransom of up to  $1 million.
<P>
Describing the administration of Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad  Allawi as "a puppet government in the hands of the Americans,"  Torretta said elections planned for January would have no  legitimacy: "During my days in detention ... I came to the  conclusion it will take decades to put Iraq back on its feet."
<P>
Torretta, who lived in Iraq before, during and after the  U.S.-led invasion, said she wanted to return despite her ordeal  -- but would not do so as long as U.S. troops were there: "I've  got to wait until the end of the U.S. occupation," she said.
<P>
She said she did know whether Italy bought her freedom from  the kidnappers: "If a ransom was paid then I am very sorry. But  I know nothing about it ... I believe that (the kidnappers)  were a very political, religious group and that in the end they  were convinced that we were not enemies."</p>
