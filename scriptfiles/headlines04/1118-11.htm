<p>STOCKHOLM - John Zogby, president of the polling firm Zogby 
International, told IPS he has been calling it "the Armageddon election" 
for about a year. Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader believes 
the Republican Party was able to "steal it before election day."

<p>Facts suggest something went very wrong on Nov. 2.

<p>Speculation focuses upon a number of questions -- purposeful miscounts, 
anomalies surrounding electronic voting (e-voting) machines, particularly 
the optical scan types; and numerous reports of voting "irregularities" in 
heavily Democratic areas.
<p>
"What they 'do' is minorities," Nader said, highlighting the thrust of 
Republican efforts, "and make sure that there aren't enough voting machines 
for the minority areas. They have to wait in line ... for hours, and most of 
them don't. There are all kinds of ways, and that's why I was quoted as 
saying, "this election was hijacked from A to Z," Nader told IPS.
<p>
Zogby was concerned about the difference between some of the exit polls 
(surveys of individuals who have just cast ballots) and the official vote 
counts. "We're talking about the Free World here," he pointedly noted.
<p>
On Nov. 10, University of Pennsylvania Professor Steven F Freeman, whose 
expertise includes "research methods," compiled an analysis entitled 'The 
Unexplained Exit Poll Discrepancy'. The document was prepared in view of 
the unusually large differences between what exit polls had predicted and 
the recorded vote tallies.
<p>
His findings suggest Democratic challenger Senator John Kerry should have 
received far more votes than he did.
<p>
In three of the key battleground states -- Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania 
-- Freeman's analysis states the odds of Kerry receiving the percentage of 
votes recorded, given the exit poll findings, were less than three in one 
thousand, per state.
<p>
Freeman also determined that the odds of any two of these states 
simultaneously reaching their stated vote tallies were "on the order of 
one-in-a-million," and the odds of all three states arriving at the vote 
counts they did "are 250 million to one."
<p>
"Something is definitely wrong," said Zogby.
<p>

Highlighting both the expected accuracy of exit polls and the significant 
disparity that Kerry's defeat illustrated, Republican consultant, 
commentator and Fox-TV News regular Dick Morris wrote an article, 'Those 
Faulty Exit Polls Were Sabotage', suggesting a pollster conspiracy to swing 
the election for Kerry.
<p>
In doing so he, perhaps inadvertently, provided ammunition for arguments 
from the opposite side -- that the exit polls were correct but the final 
results were fudged. "Exit polls are almost never wrong," argued Morris, 
and in 10 of the 11 key states they had predicted significantly fewer votes 
for Republican President George W Bush than he was eventually credited with.
<p>
In New Hampshire, Bush tallied a surprising 9.5 percent more votes than 
predicted, the most significant difference in any of the key states.
<p>
Morris observed that outside the United States, exit polls are often used 
to provide a check on official vote counts, in his words, "to foreclose the 
possibility of finagling with the returns."
<p>
Among the most cited exit polls were those conducted by Mitofsky 
International, whose founder, Warren Mitofsky, is widely credited with 
having invented exit polling. Zogby, whose firm was not among those that 
provided network TV coverage of the Nov. 2 election, described the 
possibility of either incompetence or fraud causing the controversial 
deviation as "impossible."
<p>
According to Zogby, it would have required "wrong sampling in wrong areas 
throughout the country," or the purposeful manipulation of data to obtain 
exit poll results so significantly different from the official totals. He 
viewed neither as a possibility.
<p>
When asked what exactly had happened then, Zogby replied, "a problem, but I 
don't know where it is ... something's wrong here, though."
<p>
On Nov. 5, Nader requested a hand recount of New Hampshire ballots, 
subsequently telling IPS he had "reports of irregularities there, and we 
have the cooperation of the state government ... the state attorney-general 
and secretary of state."
<p>
Nader also said his headquarters had been flooded with requests for 
assistance from a number of states.

<p>
On Thursday, five of the 11 New Hampshire voting wards where Nader 
requested a recount will undertake new tallies. According to his staff, all 
11 wards had their votes counted with optical scan machines, primarily the 
AccuVote models made by Diebold.
<p>
"If there are irregularities, it may have broader applications in other 
states," Nader said, adding that the current recount -- a 45,000-vote 
sample -- is expected to be completed within a week.
<p>
Allegations regarding optical scan machines' potentially allowing the 
manipulation of Florida's vote have been widely reported. In Ohio, the 
Green and Libertarian parties are pursuing a recount, numerous instances of 
voting irregularities having been reported there.
<p>
"As far as I'm concerned, this election was clearly stolen. What they did 
in Ohio was systematically deny thousands of African Americans, and other 
suspected Democrats, the vote," charged progressive author, commentator and 
activist Harvey Wasserman of Franklin County, Ohio.
<p>
"It was like Mississippi in the fifties, and it was deliberate ... had there 
been enough (voting) machines, and had people equal access to the polls 
with a reliable vote count, there is no doubt that John Kerry would have 
carried Ohio," he told IPS.
<p>
The Nov. 14 'Cleveland Plain Dealer', one of the country's top 50 
broadsheets, reported a Nov. 13 voter hearing where: "For three hours, 
burdened voters, one after another, offered sworn testimony about election 

day voter suppression and irregularities that they believe are threatening 
democracy."
<p>
"People are deeply concerned that this is the end of American democracy, 
that we cannot get a fair election," Wasserman said, poignantly adding, 
"there was no question of apathy in this election -- we had more volunteers 
than could be used ... thousands and thousands of grass-roots volunteers."
<p>
If Kerry had taken Ohio, he would have taken the presidency.
<p>

"In the end, what Nader is doing in New Hampshire is the best answer. And 
if there's a recount in Ohio," that is also important, said Charles 
Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist who 
specializes in statistical methods, elections and public opinion.
<p>
Somewhat concerned about the possible manipulation of e-voting machines, 
Franklin was more concerned over "the ordinary administration of 
elections," citing the simple logistical problems that had plagued voters.
<p>
He pointedly noted that the last two presidential elections highlighted 
"how the decisions of local people (officials) ... can have a considerable 
influence over who gets to vote, what rules govern."
<p>
When asked if he was aware of any parallels to the present election, Zogby 
replied, "I'm certainly aware of the election of 1960."
<p>
"It's been discussed, overtly, the roll that Richard Daley, and the roll 
that Lyndon Johnson played, separately," Zogby said, referring to an 
episode where the John F Kennedy campaign had supposedly asked, "How many 
votes do you have?", the reply allegedly being, "How many votes do you need?"
<p>
Of course, such examples also serve to highlight the influence "local 
people" can exert on an election's outcome.
<p>
In the end, many people speculated that the 1960 incidents were not part of 
a grand conspiracy per se, but the cumulative effects of the actions of a 
number of individuals who shared a similar perspective, acted 
semi-independently, and did whatever it took to win.
<p>
Political "dirty tricks" culminated in the Watergate scandal, forcing then 
President Richard Nixon (1969-1974) to resign, ushering in a long era 
without similar illicit activity, until questions raised by the election of 
2000.
<p>
With American democracy, until now, providing an effective model for many, 
as Zogby said, "we're talking about the Free World here."
