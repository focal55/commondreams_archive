<p>WASHINGTON  - When the Democratic Party  takes up its platform next week at the presidential nominating  convention in Boston, one of the planks it will consider is  media concentration.<p> 
			
			While the one-sentence statement is buried deep in the  41-page document, its supporters contend that it is a  recognition by the party that big media is becoming a threat to  democracy.<p> 
			
			"Because our democracy thrives on public access to diverse  sources of information from multiple sources, we support  measures to ensure diversity, competition and localism in media  ownership," the proposed platform plank states.<p> 
			
			Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y., who helped get the plank in  the platform proposal said the 27-word statement points out a  big difference between the two parties.<p> 
			
			"We were able to get this in as a very direct and simple  statement of the need for diversity," he said in an interview.  "We're saying essentially that this is the only way our  democracy survives. It's a statement of policy by our party  that is opposite of what the (chairman Michael) Powell FCC and  Republicans have said going back to (President) Reagan."<p> 
			
			Hinchey is a long-term opponent of attempts by the GOP-led  Federal Communications Commission and the big media companies  to remove barriers that limit the number and type of media  properties companies they can own.<p> 
			
			During a news conference Tuesday unveiling a poll of  journalists' and technicians' opinions on the consolidation  trend in American media, Hinchey said he expected tougher media  ownership restrictions in a Kerry administration. Sen. John  Kerry, D-Mass., is slated to accept the party's nomination July  29.<p> 
			
			"If Kerry takes the White House I think it's going to turn  around completely," Hinchey said. "When Kerry appoints the  chairman, there will be much more openness, more fairness and a  reversal of the monopolization of the media."<p> 
			
			Kerry and John Edwards already have spoken out against the  increasingly concentrated media landscape. In a Jan. 27  interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kerry called media  consolidation "a serious problem in the country" saying: "I  think the consolidation of information is a dangerous trend in  America because it has the ability to shape our Democracy and  shape the flow of information." He made similar statements on  C-SPAN last month.<p> 
			
			On Tuesday, lawmakers who support tougher media ownership  restrictions said a new poll points out the need for more  restrictions.<p> 
			
			According to the 400-person poll, front-line media  employees believe that industry consolidation has compromised  the quality of news reporting and they fear that further media  concentration will continue the trend and lead to too much  control over the news by a few corporate executives. AFL-CIO's  Department for Professional Employees sponsored the survey.<p> 
			
			The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists  (AFTRA), the Writers Guild of America-East, Actors' Equity  Association, Screen Actors Guild and the Communications Workers  of America were among a dozen unions that signed a letter  asking Powell to conduct field hearings on the issue and to  make public any proposed changes in the rules. Union leaders  said the poll underscored the need for more transparency in the  FCC's process.<p> 
			
			"This scientific poll confirms what AFTRA has asserted --  and has long been hearing from working media professionals ever  since the excessive deregulation ignited by the 1996  Telecommunications Act and subsequent FCC actions: That media  ownership consolidation is doing irreparable harm to local and  national news coverage and thus to a key fabric of democracy in  our country," AFTRA president John Connolly said. "Even as the  literal number of entertainment, news and information outlets  increases, actual decision-making, including news judgment, is  falling into fewer and fewer hands."<p> 
			
			On a 3-2 party-line vote in June 2003 the FCC agreed to  ease most of the nation's media ownership rules. A year later  the federal appeals court in Philadelphia sent the rules back  to the FCC saying the panel had failed to justify the changes.<p> 
			
			The ruling rejected major rule changes concerning the  cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations and the  concentration of broadcast ownership in local markets. Under  the FCC's deregulation policies, one company would have been  allowed to own three TV stations, eight radio stations and the  monopoly newspaper in a single market.<p> 
			
			The FCC also raised the national audience-reach ceiling for  TV broadcasters from 35%-45%. Congress lowered it to 39%.
