LONDON  - A British lawyer said Tuesday he had  uncovered evidence that U.S. troops mistreated detainees in the  northern Iraqi city of Mosul, suggesting abuse had spread far  beyond the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.
<P>
Phil Shiner sent Reuters statements by two Iraqis who said  they were hooded, stripped naked, beaten and doused with cold  water at lengthy torture sessions in a place called "the disco"  because of loud Western music constantly blasted at detainees.
<P>
One said he had seen a 14-year-old boy bleeding from his  anus. The other said he was threatened with sexual assault.
<P>
The allegations appear to be the first reports of abuse in  Mosul. Washington has acknowledged detainees were abused at Abu  Ghraib, and Shiner is leading a case on behalf of Iraqis who  say they were mistreated by British forces in Basra. Three  Iraqi staff working for Reuters say they were beaten and  sexually humiliated by U.S. troops near Falluja in January.
<P>
A U.S. military spokesman for detainee operations in Iraq  said in Baghdad that he was unaware of the allegations. "I am  surprised by them," he said. "I have visited that facility up  there and I've seen the good work that they've been doing."
<P>
In the statements provided by Shiner, Haitham Saeed  al-Mallah, an engineer, said he was brought to "the disco"  where "they left me standing for hours, handcuffed and hooded."
<P>
"Then I was kicked very hard in the stomach, which was  followed by continuous beating with a stick and with their  boots until I fell unconscious. I only woke up after they  poured over my head very cold water."
<P>
He said he was then abused in groups with other detainees,  forced to carry out exhausting exercises and beaten or doused  with cold water whenever they fell to the floor. They were not  permitted to use the toilet and allowed only two hours sleep.
<P>
"I saw a young man of 14 years of age bleeding from his  anus and lying on the floor. He was Kurdish and his name was  Hama. I heard the soldiers talking to each other about this  guy. They mentioned that the reason for this bleeding was  inserting a metal object in his anus," he said.
<P>
<b>U.S. "SURPRISED" BY ALLEGATIONS
</b>
<P>
The other alleged Mosul victim, Yasir Rubaii Saeed  al-Qutaji, was described as an Iraqi lawyer investigating  reports of abuse at "the disco" when he was arrested.</p>
<P>&nbsp;After a day and a night forced into stress positions and  doused with cold water at "the disco," he was taken to a  regular prison. Staff and interrogators there treated him  properly at night, but allowed the same "disco team" to abuse  him by day. He was threatened with sexual assault on his final  day.
<P>
"The only reason he was detained was that he was working on  documenting these cases of torture, at this prison and the  Americans then went and detained him," Shiner said.
<P>
The U.S. government has said abuse of prisoners in Iraq was  mainly confined to a few rogue soldiers at Abu Ghraib.
<P>
But in January, three Iraqis working for Reuters said they  had been subjected to sexual humiliation, anal abuse, beatings,  stress positions, sleep deprivation and disorientation using  bright lights and loud music during three days of detention at  a U.S. base outside the city of Falluja west of Baghdad.
<P>
The U.S. army said an investigation found no evidence of  such abuse. The Iraqis working for Reuters were never  interviewed for the investigation, which took evidence only  from U.S. soldiers who denied that abuse took place.
<P>
The Pentagon has rejected demands by Reuters for a more  thorough investigation.</p>
