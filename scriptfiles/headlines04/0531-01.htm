WASHINGTON  -  Members of Congress have a proud tradition of asking witnesses tough questions at famous inquiries like the Watergate and Iran-contra hearings. Now the Iraqi prison abuse scandal has some lawmakers asking a hard question of themselves: What doesn't Congress know and why doesn't it know it?</p>
<p> The disclosures about the treatment of detainees, coupled with complaints from some quarters about the Bush administration's handling of antiterrorism money, have ignited a debate over whether Congress is keeping a close enough eye on the White House and staying adequately informed on developments in Iraq.</p>
<p> Democrats, not surprisingly, think much more scrutiny is necessary and have been complaining for months that the Republican leadership in Congress is refusing to hold its allies in the administration accountable on a range of subjects. Now even some Republicans say they worry that Congress is abdicating its oversight responsibility.</p>
<p> "I believe our failure to do proper oversight has hurt our country and the administration," said Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who traveled to Iraq to get a view of the situation outside administration control. "Maybe they wouldn't have gotten into some of this trouble had our oversight been better."</p>
<p> The issue burst into the open in recent days as the Senate and House took starkly different approaches to the prison abuse inquiry, with the Senate holding a series of high-profile hearings and the House one public session. House Republican leaders criticized the Senate for grandstanding on the issue, and the House rejected a Democratic push for a broader inquiry.</p>
<p> Frustrated Democratic leaders sent a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert last Monday, demanding that he direct the relevant committees to pursue the abuse issue.</p>
<p> "There does not seem to be an investigative agenda, and a work plan for fulfilling that agenda, in place anywhere in the House," said the letter, signed by the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California; the Democratic whip, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland; and the caucus chairman, Robert Menendez of New Jersey. "We believe that the House will be derelict in its institutional oversight responsibilities unless this situation changes soon."</p>
<p> Mr. Hastert dismisses the rising criticism of the House's oversight record as a partisan effort to build a political case against the Republican leadership. He said the majority had actively kept abreast of developments in Iraq, though it might not be conducting the "show trials" he said Democrats would prefer.</p>
<p> "In Iraq, we have literally sent scores of members there to take a look and see for themselves what is happening on a bipartisan basis," Mr. Hastert said.</p>
<p> Representative Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Congress had given undue attention to the abuse of prisoners. "Maybe we should cancel every piece of Congressional business for the entire year so that the issue at Abu Ghraib can be milked until the election," he said.</p>
<p> To other lawmakers and outside experts, the feud over how far to go in examining the scandal is symptomatic of the deeper question of whether the Republican Congress is being aggressive enough in monitoring the administration when their political fortunes are so closely linked. </p>
<p> "The Republican dominance of Congress and the White House has led to an attitude of 'We can keep it within the fold; it is our team and our team will understand us,' " said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p> Democrats and others say Congress should have looked more closely at the administration's failure to provide full estimates of the cost of the new Medicare drug law and the leak of the identity of a covert C.I.A. worker, among other matters.</p>
<p> "Party has trumped institutional responsibility," said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "The sense of shared political stakes bridging either end of Pennsylvania Avenue has overwhelmed any sense of institutional responsibility."</p>
<p> Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a Republican who has made himself a thorn in the side of both Republican and Democratic administrations, says Congress rarely does enough oversight. "And I believe that is whether you have a Republican Congress versus a Republican president or a Democratic Congress versus a Democratic president,"  Mr. Grassley said. He recalled that Democrats had been all too eager to help him pursue wrongdoing in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the first George Bush, but that when he kept at it in the Clinton era, "I lost the same allies."</p>
<p> Mr. Grassley pointed out that oversight can be tedious, unglamorous work, and that it sometimes takes years to tease out problems buried deep in the bureaucracy. Mr. Hastert acknowledged that Republicans were slow to acquire the investigatory skills honed by Democrats during their 40-year dominance of the House. Some say demands on the time of lawmakers and lack of experienced staff have also contributed to diminished oversight.</p>
<p> Yet there have been serious efforts by some committees to pursue lines of inquiry over Iraq -  particularly in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its review of the upcoming transition of power, and in the House Government Reform Committee, which explored reconstruction contracts in Iraq.</p>
<p> Even leading Republicans concede privately that the Bush administration resists energetic oversight, an attitude Democrats say is reflected in the administration's occasionally dismissive attitude toward lawmakers of both parties. They point to the allegation in Bob Woodward's book "Plan of Attack" that the administration diverted $700 million in post-Sept. 11 money to secretly begin planning the war with Iraq. In the past, such a charge could have led to a full-blown inquiry.</p>
<p> Congressional Republicans said the White House appeared to have acted within the wide latitude it was given by Congress to handle the money. But the disclosure about the movement of the money, when added to the fact that lawmakers got no advance warning of the scope of the prison abuse before it exploded into the news, seems to have stirred a more assertive attitude in some.</p>
<p> Besides the prospect of more Senate hearings on prison abuse, Republicans in both the House and the Senate joined Democrats in insisting that the additional $25 billion sought by the Bush administration for Iraq be much more tightly controlled than the previous war allocations.</p>
<p> "We really do need to preserve the important role that Congress plays," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine,  as the Armed Services Committee examined the administration's request. "It is our duty."</p>
