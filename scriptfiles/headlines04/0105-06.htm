<p>WASHINGTON  - The US Army, responding to commanders' concerns about unit readiness, has decided to extend the tours of thousands of soldiers in Iraq who were due to end their service or retire before their units' return home, an army spokesman said.
<p>Under a so-called "stop loss/stop movement" order that is expected to go into effect soon, those soldiers will be required to remain in service for up to 90 days after their units return to their home base in the United States or Europe, the spokesman said.
<p>The order will affect about 7,000 soldiers currently in Iraq who were either due to end their service or retire before their unit was scheduled to redeploy, said Major Steve Stover.
<p>A similar order already is effect for members of army reserve units and for active duty soldiers who are scheduled to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan.
<p>"The question remained, what about the units currently in theater?" said Stover. "This is where the commander in the field said, 'Hey look, my operational level is starting to drop, and if it goes below a certain level, they are not combat effective.'"
<p>Soldiers affected by the order tended to be in leadership positions because of their level of experience, Stover said.
<p>"The combatant commanders said that if you replace them by taking them out now, it's going to cause turbulence and confusion, because you're taking away key leaders at a key time when a unit is currently in operation," he said.
<p>The new order comes as the army is embarking on a massive and complex rotation of its forces in Iraq.
<p>Members of Congress were briefed on the plan Monday but commanders have yet to be formally notified of the decision, he said.
<p>"It's imminent. It's going to happen this week," he said.
