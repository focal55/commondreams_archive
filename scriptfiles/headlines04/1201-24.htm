<p>A UNITED NATIONS panel of “wise men” yesterday challenged Washington’s right to take preventive military action, but acknowledged that the UN should do more to deal with terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.

<P>In a tacit rebuke to the Bush Administration, the panel said that states should take military action only when faced with an actual or imminent attack. Any “preventive” military action should require approval by the UN Security Council.

<P>“In a world full of perceived potential threats, the risk to the global order and the norm of non-intervention on which it continues to be based, is too great for the legality of unilateral preventive action, as distinct from collectively endorsed action, to be accepted,” it said.

<P>The 16-member panel, set up last year to try to mend rifts over Iraq — although it deliberately makes no direct reference to that conflict — outlines a new vision for “collective security” in an era of globe-trotting terrorist groups who can lay their hands on nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

<P>But the limits on the use of preventive military action could prove unacceptable to Bush’s Administration, which has rejected any “global test” before acting to defend itself.

<P>A senior UN official said that the panel hoped to convince America that it could better achieve security through global co-operation and a rejuvenated UN than by acting alone.

<P>While reserving the right to take “preventive” military action to the Security Council, the panel said that council members should be more ready to exercise that power.

<P>“The international community has to be concerned about terrorists, weapons of mass destruction and irresponsible states, which may conceivably justify the use of force, not just reactively but preventively and before a latent threat becomes imminent,” it said.

<P>“The question is not whether such action can be taken: it can, by the Security Council as the international community’s collective security voice. . . . The council may need to be more proactive on these issues, taking more decisive action earlier.”

<P>The panel lays down guidelines for the Security Council to decide on preventive action: it says that it should take into account the seriousness of the threat, whether the force used is proportional, whether it comes as a last resort, if it is intended to address the threat rather than some other purpose and that it has a reasonable chance of success.

<P>It calls for the five criteria to be adopted in non-binding resolutions by the Security Council and the General Assembly of all 191 UN member states. The proposals will form part of a report by Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, for a summit of world leaders in New York in September.<p align="center">Copyright 2004  Times Newspapers Ltd.</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
