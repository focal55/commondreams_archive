<p> WASHINGTON --


Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader selected longtime Green Party activist Peter Camejo to be his running mate on Monday, a move sure to boost his chances of winning the Green Party's endorsement this week and its access to ballot lines in 22 states and the District of Columbia. 
<p>Camejo, an investment adviser from Folsom, Calif., had been one of two leading contenders for the Green Party's presidential nomination. 
<p>The announcement came in advance of the Green Party convention beginning Wednesday in Milwaukee. Nader, who ran as the Green Party candidate in 2000, is not seeking the party's nomination but he has pursued an endorsement from the third party. 
<p>"Camejo shares my concerns for economic and social justice as well as the urgent need to protect our environment," Nader said in a statement before introducing him at an afternoon news conference. 
<p>One Green Party leader said a Nader-Camejo ticket would have a very strong chance of winning the party's endorsement. 
<p>"This is an opportunity for Nader to make an overture to the party membership," said Ben Manski, one of five co-chairs of the Green Party. "I think it certainly would put him much more in the running but not a guarantee." 
<p>Nader also has been endorsed by the national Reform Party, which gives him access to the ballot in at least seven states, including the battlegrounds of Florida and Michigan. 
<p>Nader garnered nearly 3 percent of the vote in 2000, when he was viewed by many as having cost Democrat Al Gore the White House by taking votes in the deciding state of Florida. But he chose not to run under the party banner this election year. 
<p>Camejo received more than 212,000 votes as the Green Party candidate for California governor during the 2003 recall drive that led to the ouster of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and the election of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
<p>Nader was polling about 6 percent nationally, according to a recent Associated Press poll conducted by Ipsos-Public Affairs. The consumer advocate has raised just under $1 million and spent nearly all of it, starting June with about $73,000 in the bank and just under $25,000 in debts, according to the latest reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
<p>The Green Party has ballot access for a presidential candidate in Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C.
