<p>West Bend resident Bob Schaar fought in the Vietnam War more than
            35 years ago. The war is over, but his passion to spread the message
            of peace lives on.</p>
            <p>A 10-foot stone circle resting on his front lawn in the shape of
            a peace sign says it all.</p>
            <p>When he moved to West Bend in 1988, he said the lawn surrounding
            his current home was professionally landscaped. The stone circle was
            there, but it was full of flowers and plants.</p>

      Bob Schaar tends to his &quot;peaceful&quot; garden in front of his West Bend home Monday afternoon. With the help of mulch and stones in red, white and blue, his wife Jude says, it&#8217;s a &quot;universal symbol ... we can all relate to.&quot;<br>

He said he tried to keep up with the gardening, but after a while
            it all grew over.</p>
            <p>After searching for the perfect red and blue mulch and white
            stones to fill in the circle's three sections, his motivation helped
            him finish the project in a week's time.</p>
            <p>&quot;Once he gets an idea, he's full steam ahead,&quot;
            explained his wife Jude.</p>
            <p>Each third of the peace sign sports a patriotic color and a rose
            bush that fits in with Schaar's theme.</p>
            <p>One side holds a Chicago peace rose, the other contains a love
            rose.</p>
            <p>&quot;Peace and love. It's all about peace and love,&quot; he
            stated.</p>
            <p>His interest in the symbol goes back to the 1960s.</p>
            <p>While he was in Vietnam, he flew in an Air Force jet in the Navy
            and spent the remainder of his time on shore duty, Schaar explained.</p>
            <p>&quot;I was gung-ho and supported what the government was doing.
            But after I got home, I started comparing my experiences to what the
            government was saying and it was two different things,&quot; he
            said.</p>
            <p>&quot;I always kind of dug (the peace sign) after that.&quot;</p>
            <p>The symbol decorated many a home and wall in his past, he
            explained, because &quot;it's a good concept.&quot;</p>
            <p>Jude says his patriotism stems from his service in the war.</p>
            <p>&quot;He was in the Navy Reserves and he even retired from the
            Navy as chief,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>&quot;He cares very strongly about our country.&quot;</p>
            <p>Their three sons all have similar feelings to their father. Even
            though they may not all be home to enjoy it, Jude says, they are
            proud of their dad and his love of the country.</p>
            <p>Others may feel the same about the current war and situations our
            country faces, but Jude says, &quot;Bob puts it out there for people
            to see and experience.&quot;</p>
            <p>Even though Schaar says, he just finished the project, he's
            already seen people stop by his house to look at it.</p>
            <p>&quot;It's a universal feeling,&quot; Jude commented. &quot;It
            makes a statement we can all relate to.&quot;</p>
