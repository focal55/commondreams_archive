RAFAH, Gaza Strip  - Defying international fury  and a rare U.S. rebuke, Israel expanded its bloodiest Gaza  Strip raid in years on Thursday after killing 40 Palestinians  in three days of fighting in the Rafah refugee camp.
<p> 
			
			Tensions rose further after a Tel Aviv court convicted  Palestinian uprising leader Marwan Barghouthi of murder,  drawing vows of defiance from a populist firebrand seen as a  possible successor to President Yasser Arafat.<p> 
			
			"So long as occupation continues, the Intifada (uprising)  will not stop," Barghouthi, 44, said after the verdict in a  case Palestinians condemned as a show trial. "As long as  Palestinian mothers are weeping, Israeli mothers will also  weep."<p> 
			
			The U.N. Security Council urged an end to violence after  Israeli forces killed 10 Palestinians at a peaceful protest on  Wednesday. The Council convened at the behest of Arabs incensed  at what they branded a "war crime."<p> 
			
			Reflecting its displeasure, the United States, Israel's  chief ally, allowed adoption of the U.N. resolution by  abstaining rather than using its veto. President Bush urged  restraint from the Jewish state.<p> 
			
			Senior U.S. officials kept up pressure by making phone  calls to their Israeli counterparts urging them to wrap up the  three-day-old raid as quickly as possible, an Israeli political  source said.<p> 
			
			Israeli commentators predicted Israel would soon comply.<p> 
			
			But the army, which stormed the Rafah camp after losing 13  soldiers in Gaza ambushes last week, forged ahead on Thursday.<p> 
			
			Troops pushed into Rafah districts on the border with  Egypt, where the army says it is searching for tunnels used to  smuggle weapons for a Palestinian revolt since 2000.<p> 
			
			ZOO "KNOCKED DOWN"<p> 
			
			Amid the Israeli sweep, troops knocked down a small zoo, a  rare place of amusement for refugee children, residents said.<p> 
			
			The army, which has demolished dozens of Rafah homes during  the raid, denied flattening the zoo as Palestinian boys were  seen chasing a bewildered-looking ostrich through the streets.<p> 
			
			Overnight helicopter strikes killed three militants and two  other men, witnesses said. The army said it struck gunmen.  Witnesses said soldiers shot dead a 39-year-old man on his  roof. The army said troops had "spotted a terrorist and shot  him."<p> 
			
			Witnesses said a 27-year-old man was also killed in Rafah.<p> 
			
			International outrage reached a new pitch on Wednesday  after Israeli tanks and helicopters fired toward protesters  marching to demand humanitarian aid. The youngest of the dead  was nine years old. Medics said more than 50 people were  wounded.<p> 
			
			Troops said they did not aim to hit the rally.<p> 
			
			Violence has spiked since Israeli Prime Minister Ariel  Sharon proposed evacuating troops and Jewish settlers in a plan  backed by most Israelis and the United States, but rejected by  his right-wing Likud party in a referendum this month.<p> 
			
			Militants want to claim as a victory any Israeli pullout  from Gaza, but the army is determined to smash them first.<p> 
			
			In the West Bank, Israeli troops killed a senior Hamas  militant in an exchange of fire in the town of Qalqilya.<p> 
			
			Amid the bloodshed, a Tel Aviv court found Barghouthi,  second in popularity only to Arafat among Palestinians, guilty  of masterminding the killings of five people. But it cleared  him in attacks that claimed the lives of more than 20 others.<p> 
			
			Prosecutors asked for five life sentences for Barghouthi, a  West Bank leader who had maintained his innocence since his  2002 arrest but expressed pride in resistance to Israeli  occupation.<p> 
			
			Legal experts said the verdict was a blow to Israel's bid  to assign wholesale blame to Palestinian leaders for attacks  carried out by militants alleged to be under their command.<p> 
			
			But that did not stop the judges from pointing the finger  at Arafat. Their written ruling charged that Barghouthi's  orders for attacks were sometimes "based on instructions" from  Arafat.<p> 
			
			Justice Minister Yosef Lapid issued a threat that Israel  might put Arafat on trial one day. Arafat aide Nabil Abu  Rdainah called the allegations "unfounded and baseless."
			<p> 

			
			Israel accuses Arafat, largely confined to his West Bank  headquarters for more than two years, of having fomented  suicide bombings and ambush attacks. He has denied the  allegations.
