WASHINGTON — A multibillion-dollar program to deal with  millions of gallons of high-level radioactive waste at a nuclear weapons plant in South Carolina   is failing because technicians cannot get the waste out of the tanks where it has been stored for the last half-century, an influential environmental group says.</p>
<P>
The failure raises the likelihood that the wastes will cause further contamination of the Savannah River, which separates South Carolina from Georgia, and underground water supplies, says a report due to be issued Thursday by the group,  the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research.</p>
<P>
The Energy Department, however, maintains that all is going according to plan, despite the fact that a factory built to package the wastes in glass has produced nearly a third of the packages and that they contain only about 3 percent of the radioactivity at most.</p>
<P>
The wastes are left over from production of plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. For years the wastes were poured into giant underground tanks and  mixed with chemicals to reduce the acidity and protect the tank walls. The result is that the tanks now hold a mixture of sludges, salts and liquids.</p>
<P>
The Energy Department's intention was to concentrate the radioactive components  and mix them with  molten glass. The material would then be  shaped into logs that would  be carefully sealed in stainless steel containers so they could  be buried deep beneath the earth at Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas,  and remain isolated for 10,000 years.  The remaining, less radioactive material was to be  left behind at the South Carolina plant after  being mixed with cement, into a mixture called "saltcrete" that would keep it from spreading.</p>
<P>
But the chemical process chosen to wash the most radioactive material out of the tanks also created benzene, an explosive gas, and had to be scrapped. The Energy Department is still working on a replacement process.</p>
<P>
As one example of the problems cited by the institute, based here, its report  says   the amount of radioactive cesium that the Energy Department now plans to leave behind in a single tank is five times as large as the amount it planned two years ago to leave in all 51 tanks combined.</p>
<P>
A different environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, won a suit against the Energy Department in a federal court in Idaho last year over the department's plan to leave large amounts of radioactive material not only in South Carolina  but in   Idaho and  Washington  State as well.  The department has appealed. </p>
<P>
The new report's principal author, Arjun Makhijani, president of the institute, said  the Energy Department was turning the South Carolina plant, the Savannah River Site, into a "de facto high-level radioactive waste dump." </p>
<P>
But Charles Hansen, assistant manager for waste disposal at Savannah River, said in a telephone interview that the glass factory there  was dealing with waste from the oldest, most leak-prone tanks first and that these had less radioactivity in them than the newer tanks.</p>
<P>
Jessie Roberson, the assistant secretary of energy for environmental management, said no tanks would be considered closed until outside regulators had concluded that the amount of radioactive material remaining inside did not pose a threat. She said plans were to remove 95 percent of the radioactivity.</p>
<P>
The Savannah River Site has already leaked radioactive isotopes and chemical poisons into the water, although contamination remains well below the levels allowed by federal drinking water standards.</p>
