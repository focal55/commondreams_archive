NEW YORK  - Democrat John Kerry turned up his  criticism of President Bush's leadership in Iraq on Monday,  accusing him of "colossal failures of judgment" that have  turned the country into a haven for terrorists and made America  more vulnerable.

The Democratic presidential candidate argued in a speech at  New York University that the U.S.-led invasion had weakened  national security.<p> 
			
			"The president's policy in Iraq precipitated the very  problem he said he was trying to prevent," Kerry said. "Iraq is  becoming a sanctuary for a new generation of terrorists who  someday could hit the United States."<p> 
			
			Against a backdrop of rising casualties, fears of civil war  and questions about whether elections can be held in Iraq in  January as scheduled, Kerry has tried to make the conflict a  key barometer of Bush's record in office.<p> 
			
			"The president misled, miscalculated, and mismanaged every  aspect of this undertaking," Kerry said, accusing Bush of  making "catastrophic decisions" and surrounding himself with  ideologues who provide "stubborn incompetence."<p> 
			
			"The president now admits to miscalculations in Iraq,"  Kerry said. "His were not the equivalent of accounting errors.  They were colossal failures of judgment -- and judgment is what  we look for in a president."<p> 
			
			"George Bush has no strategy for Iraq. I do, and I have all  along," Kerry said.<p> 
			
			CALLS FOR SUMMIT<p> 
			
			To win international support for the war, Kerry proposed  that Bush convene a summit meeting of world leaders in New York  this week for the General Assembly of the United Nations. Bush  addresses the United Nations on Tuesday.<p> 
			
			Kerry said he would offer other nations who could provide  troops with specific roles for training Iraqi security forces  and securing its borders and then let them bid on  reconstruction contracts instead of locking them out of the  process.<p> 
			
			He also said the United States must recruit training  assistance for Iraqi forces from NATO allies and wage a  reconstruction plan that uses Iraqi contractors and workers  rather than big U.S. corporations like Halliburton, which  formerly was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney and has won  billion dollar government contracts to rebuild Iraq.<p> 
			
			To guarantee elections next year in Iraq, the United States  should recruit troops from allies for a U.N. protection force  and train Iraqis to manage polling places, Kerry said<p> 
			
			"If we do not change course, there is the prospect of a war  with no end in sight," he said.<p> 
			
			While Kerry has said he would begin to bring a large number  of the nearly 140,000 U.S. troops home in the first six months  of his administration and be better able than Bush to rally  international support, the Massachusetts senator has struggled  to draw clear contrasts with the president over Iraq.<p> 
			
			Republicans have made much of the fact that he voted to  give Bush authority to use force against Saddam Hussein yet  criticized the war and voted against its funding.<p> 
			
			Kerry says while he voted to give the president authority  for the war he did not support his handling of the conflict.<p> 
			
			Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt said Kerry offers a  policy of "defeat and retreat" and his proposals were "more  contradiction and confusion from a candidate who is twisting in  the wind."<p> 
			
			He also contended that Kerry's proposals already were  contained in plans that Bush has made public to end the  conflict in Iraq.<p>
