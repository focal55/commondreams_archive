<p>LOS ANGELES  - Neil Young  wants to talk about
vegetable oil.
<p>
 It would be reasonable to expect that the rock 'n' roll
veteran has more pressing matters on his mind -- he's just
launched a month-long concert tour to complement the theatrical
release of "<a href="http://www.neilyoung.com/trailer.html" target="_new">Greendale</a>," his first film in 22 years.

It would be reasonable to expect that the rock 'n' roll veteran has more pressing matters on his mind -- he's just launched a month-long concert tour to complement the theatrical release of 'Greendale,' his first film in 22 years. But for anyone familiar with the project's storyline, which tackles such weighty subjects as religious warfare, corporate duplicity, the erosion of privacy and the destruction of natural resources, it will come as no surprise that its creator is eager to discuss not merely the tour itself but the tour's means of transportation.

But for anyone familiar with the project's storyline, which
tackles such weighty subjects as religious warfare, corporate
duplicity, the erosion of privacy and the destruction of
natural resources, it will come as no surprise that its creator
is eager to discuss not merely the tour itself but the tour's
means of transportation.
<p>
 "I have 17 diesel vehicles, and they're all running on
vegetable oil farmed by American farmers," Young, one of the
founders of the annual Farm Aid charity concerts, said in a
recent interview with Reuters.
<p>
 Traveling cross-country in that biodiesel caravan with
Young are his longtime backing band Crazy Horse and a troupe of
friends and family, most of whom are reprising roles they
created in the film. In Young's visionary slant on contemporary
Americana, they play the residents of an invented California
town.
<p>
With its rural setting and "down-home" people, Young said,
"Greendale" is "almost like Disney at first. It's pretty
mellow." But there's a decidedly non-Disney resonance to the
fictional story's events -- murder, civil disobedience, FBI 
surveillance and media voyeurism.
 <p>
 OLD MAN TAKE A LOOK AT MY LIFE
 <p>
 "You can read about it in any paper; it's happening right
now," Young said. "They're real people. And they're being
affected by what's going on."
 <p>
 Emblematic of that is the character of Grandpa, the
outspoken patriarch of the Green family. Cutting to the heart
of the matter with folksy and incisive observations, he's
struck a chord with American concert audiences.
 <p>
 "He's having a rough time," Young said. "The whole thing
that he believed in is breaking down." Young senses that, like
Grandpa, his U.S. audiences "don't like America to not be free.
They don't like all of this behind-the-scenes stuff," he added,
referring to the Patriot Act, a controversial tool in the U.S.
government's war on terror.
 <p>
 Young said he supported the act until he saw how it was
being implemented. "It gives people who are shown to be
untrustworthy -- and unworthy of having power -- way too much
power."
 <p>
 But for all the bleak issues that "Greendale" confronts,
it's not hopelessness that prevails but a powerful sense of
renewal, with 18-year-old protagonist Sun Green (Sarah White)
finding her voice as an artist and protester.
 <p>
 "I believe in youth," Young said. "It's eternally going to
wash away all of the sins and start over again. It is the great
thing that happens."
 <p>
 Young, whose four-decade career has been characterized by
faithfulness to his muse rather than slavishness to audience
expectations, didn't set out to create a self-described
"musical novel."
 <p>
 MULTIMEDIA APPROACH
 <p>
 He followed his instincts to new ground, and "Greendale"
has evolved into a multimedia composition that includes the
film and concert/stage show, plus two editions of a CD/DVD set,
a book to be published in the spring and an intricately
detailed Web component (http://www.neilyoung.com), complete
with the Green family tree and character profiles.
 <p>
 Performing "Greendale's" 10-song cycle last summer in a
solo acoustic tour of Europe, before the album was released,
Young prefaced the numbers with explanations of the events
linking them, adding and refining details with each telling.
The introductions sometimes ran longer than the songs
themselves and possessed a vivid visual sense.
<p>
 "When the story of Greendale came out in the music and I
finished the record, that's when it struck me that we could
make a film," Young said.
<p>
He experimented with dialogue for a long-form video, and
found the juxtaposition of dramatic scenes and band
performances "no good." But director Bernard Shakey (Young's
nom de film) saw "an otherworldly quality" in the acted
sequences. He continued working with his cast -- among them
Young's wife, Pegi -- who lip-synced to the album's tracks.
<p>
Self-distributed by Young's own Shakey Pictures, the film
is set to be shown in at least 40 cities so far.</p>
