<P>KUALA LUMPUR - Western countries have fueled international terrorism through the invasion of Iraq  and their stand on the Palestinians, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said.
<p>Abdullah, who is chairman of the 57-nation Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the 116-member Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), made the charge Thursday in a two-hour speech to his ruling party's annual assembly.
<p>He urged Muslims to reject the use of terrorism, saying it contravened the teachings of Islam, while criticising the West for &quot;the increasing prejudice against Muslims worldwide&quot;.
<p>&quot;We must reject violence that targets innocent civilians. Similarly, violence that is caused by any party, be it nations or militant groups, cannot be accepted,&quot; he said.
<p>&quot;The term 'jihad' (struggle) should not be misused and should not be misinterpreted to justify terrorism. Such actions only serve to tarnish the teachings of Islam. Islam does not permit such violence. If unchecked, such cruelty will benefit no one.&quot;
<p>Efforts to prevent terrorism should address the root causes, he told delegates to the congress of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the first he has addressed as party leader since taking over from former premier Mahathir Mohamad last year.
<p>&quot;Malaysia will work to convince the countries of the West in particular to reassess and change their policies in the Middle East,&quot; he said.
<p>&quot;Their stand on the Palestinian issue and their actions in contravening international law, such as the invasion of Iraq are factors that fuel acts of terror.&quot;
<p>In an obvious reference to the United States, Abdullah said: &quot;There is unease around the world that a single country dominates all the military, economic, political and cultural dimensions of power.&quot;
<p>A more peaceful world could only be achieved if nations refrained from the use of force unless it was sanctioned by the United Nations  and respected international law and national sovereignty, he said.
<p>Abdullah called on Muslim nations to help in the reconstruction of Iraq, warning that if they did not a country which was once &quot;a symbol of Islam's greatness ... will be rebuilt in the mould and under the influence of others.&quot;
<p>Reconstruction efforts should take place under the supervision of the United Nations, which should be strengthened and given a key role in fighting the war on terror, Abdullah said.
<p>He called for greater unity among the members of the OIC, the world's biggest grouping of Islamic nations.
<p>&quot;Collectively, the OIC must shatter the increasing prejudice against Muslims worldwide. The international community must stop equating Islam with violence, poverty and indignity.
<p>&quot;The OIC must address the issues that are contributing to the growing schism between the Muslim world and the West,&quot; he said.
<p>&quot;The unresolved Palestinian issue remains a central issue that must be addressed by the Ummah (Islamic comunity) and the global community.
<p>&quot;The international community must uphold the rights of the Palestinian people to national independence and the exercise of sovereignty in their own state, with Jerusalem as its capital,&quot; he said.
<p>In an address broadcast on national television, Abdullah also outlined his vision of the role Islam should play in Malaysia, one of the world's most economically advanced Muslim countries.
<p>&quot;Islam makes it compulsory for Muslims to embrace knowledge in all fields. The misconception that there exists a difference between so-called secular knowledge and religious knowledge must be corrected.
<p>&quot;Islam demands the mastery of science and technology and the enhancement of skills and expertise,&quot; he said.
