<p>STOCKHOLM - While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
is supposed to safeguard the nation's medical products, drawing upon the 
substantive expertise of its drug scientists in vigilant dedication to the 
public's health, that is not the case today.
<p>Documentation, interviews and recent drug debacles depict a brutally 
different reality, with the Vioxx scandal alone estimated to have resulted 
in 30,000-55,000 U.S. deaths.

<!--/endimage/-->"You have an agency in denial -- the FDA still maintains it made no mistake 
in the approval or regulation of Vioxx," says the agency's associate safety 
director, Dr David J Graham.
<p>Vioxx was voluntary withdrawn by its manufacturer, Merck and Co, on Sep. 
30, 2004 due to substantively increased risk of heart attack and stroke. 
Since then, questions have been raised regarding similar problems in other 
pain medications like Celebrex and Aleve.
<p>
Graham, who provided the figures on the Vioxx deaths, also told IPS that -- 
despite the recent linkage between some antidepressants and suicide -- the 
FDA is in the process of "misleading the public in their (antidepressant) 
labeling ... taking care of business rather than patient safety."
<p>
Graham, whose November testimony before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee 
rocked the FDA's leadership, warned that while the agency's proposed new 
label for the class of antidepressants known as SSRIs cites a "suicidality" 
rate of one-two percent, a senior FDA official acknowledged in September 
that number was based upon drug trials that "failed to capture most of the 
reactions of suicidality."
<p>
A 20-year FDA veteran, Graham then noted that an alternative trial found 
"the actual rate was somewhere around seven or eight percent," an 
incredibly substantive difference from the proposed FDA numbers.
<p>
Investigation reveals that dangers of drugs are being deliberately 
downplayed, and the public misled.
<p>
Notably, a March 2003 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services Inspector General (DHHS-IG), Janet Rehnquist, found that just 12 
percent of FDA scientists were completely confident that "labeling 
decisions adequately address key safety concerns."
<p>
In his most recent congressional testimony on Nov. 18, Graham named five 
drugs as candidates for market withdrawal: Accutane, an acne treatment; 
Bextra, the pain medication; Crestor, which lowers cholesterol; Meridia, a 
weight reduction drug; and Serevent, an asthma medication.
<p>

All of the preceding drugs' manufacturers were reported declaring their 
medications safe, paralleling similar pronouncements made by Merck and 
Company prior to its withdrawal of Vioxx.
<p>
At the same time, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Iowa republican 
Charles Grassley, expressed his belief the FDA was "too cozy" with the drug 
industry.
<p>
Graham urged Congress to pursue legislation separating the FDA offices that 
address drug safety from the drug review and approval structure, arguing 
that creating an independent body to review drug problems would avoid the 
need to seek action on problem medications from the very individuals who 
had approved them, which is now what happens.
<p>
Both the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have come under 
increasingly strong criticism for alleged distortion of research, their 
"cozy" relationship with the drug industry said to be at the root of the 
problem.
<p>
'The National Institutes of Health: Public Servant or Private Marketer?' 
headlined the Dec. 22 'Los Angeles Times', which revealed that while 
physicians have relied on the NIH to draft medical standards, the agency's 
researchers accepted "substantive fees and stock from drug companies ... an 
unabashed mingling of science and commerce."
<p>
The NIH creates treatment guidelines for use by physicians, but 
documentation reveals that many of those working at the institutes to 
create the guidelines were quietly on the pay of the drug companies whose 
products they were suggesting.
<p>
"It's more than manipulation -- they (the FDA and NIH) put their seal of 
approval on things that they knew were false, were wrong ... they've 
betrayed the trust. Instead of servants of the public, they became truly 
agents and promoters of the Industry," said Vera Hassner Sharav, a renowned 
drug industry critic whose years of work as head of the <a href="http://www.ahrp.org/" target="_new">Alliance for Human 
Research Protection</a> (AHRP) broke much of the ground for today's revelations.
<p>
"Now we're seeing the pattern, we're seeing that it isn't one drug, not one 
company, but rather the entire enterprise," added Hassner Sharav in an 
interview.
<p>
What continually resurfaces is federal agencies' effective abdication of 
their watchdog role, interrupted only by scientists of integrity who have 
gone beyond their agency structures in attempting to alert the public to 
growing dangers.

<p>
Economic and political goals appear to have replaced the need to safeguard 
the safety of the U.S. public and agencies' scientific integrity, say 
observers.
<p>
"Over the last couple of years, we ... began to hear reports out of a 
number of the federal agencies that 'something was going on', that research 
and analysis by government scientists was being systematically censored or 
ignored ... or misrepresented in some way," said Kathleen Rest, executive 
director of the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_new">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> (UCS).
<p>
In an interview Rest described what she saw as a "pattern," one of 
"politicizing or manipulating scientific advisory boards." The UCS -- whose 
membership encompasses much of the cream of America's scientists, including 
a number of Nobel laureates -- also found "evidence and cases of agencies 
manipulating or suppressing scientific analysis."
<p>
The March 2003 FDA report by the DHHS-IG, whose public release presented 
only information portraying the agency in a favorable light, was obtained 
in full under the Freedom of Information Act by the UCS and another 
non-governmental organization (NGO), <a href="http://www.peer.org/" target="_new">Public Employees for Environmental 
Responsibility</a> (PEER).
<p>
While the release of only the report's positive conclusions further 
highlights the official spin being broadly put on research findings, all of 
those interviewed spoke of the devastating potential of disseminating 
misleading scientific data. Graham described the yearly death toll from 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) across the full spectrum of available 
medication as "massive."
<p>
Both the 'Journal of the American Medical Association' and Britain's 
'Lancet' have described ADRs as the fourth leading cause of death in the 
United States. But despite such severe human costs, the full version of the 
DHHS-IG report revealed that about one-fifth of FDA scientists had "been 
pressured to approve or recommend approval" for a medication "despite 
reservations about the safety, efficacy or quality of the drug."
<p>
According to Graham, "the agency (FDA) has never given a high priority to 
safety." Instead he saw its main pursuit as the "review and approval of 
drugs," adding that the vast majority of agency resources were expended in 
this effort. Accordingly, those who work in review and approval areas have 
the most influence upon FDA policy, he added.
<p>
Confirming reports of the pressures applied to government experts who dare 
to speak out, Graham warned, "intimidation of scientists who threaten the 
status quo at FDA is routine."
<p>

He described how, after he sought the withdrawal of an arthritis drug 
called Arava, his superior addressed his concerns that the medication 
induced liver failure.
<p>
"The division director spent the first 10 minutes of that meeting screaming 
at me. Basically, standing up, jugular veins bulging in his neck, eyes sort 
of bugging out of his head, screaming ... basically trying to intimidate me 
so that I'd change my conclusion."

<p>
Arava is still on the market today.
<p>
Citing another instance, Graham recalled his 1999 attempt to have the 
diabetes drug Rezulin withdrawn for also inducing liver failure. He noted 
that while Britain withdrew the drug in 1997, the FDA delayed Rezulin's 
market recall until 2000, citing a policy of "risk management," though 
Graham noted that his findings already indicated the futility of such an 
approach.
<p>
Those marketing Rezulin "were making roughly two million dollars a day" on 
the medication, Graham added, so the extra market time provided a financial 
bonus to the medication's makers.
<p>
The scientist also described how he was given a poor performance evaluation 
after providing accurate congressional testimony on drug safety 
shortcomings. His supervisor at the time informed him "my job was to please 
him," describing that as a "direct quote."
<p>
When asked if this meant his job was "not to safeguard the public," Graham 
replied, "right, my job was to please him."
<p>
Complicating efforts to maintain scientific integrity, Graham noted that 
existing federal protections for whistleblower have been gutted, and that a 
current whistleblower protection bill is being blocked in Congress.
<p>
Despite obvious concern over the potential ramifications for his future, 
Graham emphasized his belief that "my job is to look after drug safety for 
the American people."
