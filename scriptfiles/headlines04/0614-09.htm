<p>BAGHDAD - In an early test of its imminent sovereignty, Iraq's new government 
has been resisting a U.S. demand that thousands of foreign contract workers 
here be granted immunity from Iraqi law, in the same way as U.S. military 
forces are now immune, according to Iraqi sources.
<P>The U.S. proposal, although not widely known, has touched a nerve of  
some nationalist-minded Iraqis already chafing under the 14-month-old U.S.-led 
occupation. If accepted by Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, it would put the highly 
visible U.S. foreign contract workers into a special legal category, not 
subject to military justice and beyond the reach of Iraq's justice system.
<P>The U.S. request, confirmed Sunday by Allawi's office, is one of a number 
of delicate issues revolving around government authority that will confront 
the incoming U.S. ambassador, John Negroponte, when Allawi's interim 
government assumes formal sovereignty June 30.
<P>Although the Bush administration has repeatedly promised that Iraqis will 
receive authentic sovereignty, the U.S. military has made it clear that U.S. 
officers will remain in charge of security, the country's top concern. People 
here widely assume U.S. influence will remain decisive for a long time in 
almost every domain.
<P>The in-control status of U.S. troops and officials  --  from humvee 
drivers who demand priority in traffic to civilian administrators intervening 
in the choice of Iraqi leaders  --  often has been cited by Iraqis who oppose 
the occupation on nationalist grounds. The civilian contract employees, 
particularly armed guards, have generated similar resentment from Iraqis, many 
of whom long ago tired of having foreigners tell them where they can and 
cannot go.
<P>The question of the contract workers' status also has arisen because of 
two U.S. contract employees at Abu Ghraib prison who were accused in a 
Pentagon report of participating in illegal abuse of Iraqi prisoners. The two  
--  Steven Stephanowicz of CACI International, an Arlington, Va., defense firm,
and John Israel of the Titan Corp. of San Diego  --  have not been charged 
with any crimes in Iraq or the United States, although some of their Army 
colleagues face military tribunals.
<P>As an occupying army, the 138,000 U.S. troops stationed in Iraq have been 
outside Iraqi law since U.S.-led forces took over the country in April 2003. 
The troops will remain so exempt on the basis of a June 8 U.N. Security 
Council resolution and an accompanying exchange of letters between Allawi and 
the U.S. government, in which Iraq requests their continued presence, 
according to a senior U.S. military official.
<P>As a result, there will be no need for an immediate status of forces 
agreement  --  the kind that usually governs U.S. military presence in foreign 
countries, the official said. U.S. soldiers will continue to be subject to U.S.
military justice only.
<P>"We will continue to operate more or less as before," the official added.
<P>But the status of civilian contract workers has become a special question 
because they are not covered by the Security Council resolution or the letter 
from Allawi requesting that U.S. forces remain in Iraq for an undetermined 
time. They do not come under U.S. military jurisdiction because they are not 
part of the military, although some are hired by the Pentagon.
<P>The U.S.-run Coalition Provisional Authority has asked Allawi to grant 
the contract workers immunity from prosecution in Iraq similar to that granted 
soldiers, said George Sada, Allawi's spokesman.
<P>"They have made that demand," Sada said. "We think it is a bit too much. 
It is under discussion."
<P>The Coalition Provisional Authority did not respond to questions for 
comment on the proposal.
<P>The number of foreign contract workers in Iraq has fluctuated greatly 
over the months. Many civilians working in the reconstruction effort have left 
in the past few months because of rising violence and the taking of foreign 
hostages. But many have remained, particularly guards, who are highly visible 
around Baghdad and other cities with their armored four-wheel-drive vehicles, 
automatic rifles and flak jackets.
<P>Estimates of the total number of foreigners working here  --  from 
Americans to South Africans to Chileans  --  have ranged from 20,000 to 30,000.
"But no one really knows," said a civilian security executive.
<P>The U.S. proposal was believed to cover only U.S. citizens. The senior 
military official said that after June 30 it would be up to the embassies of 
each country to work out arrangements for their nationals.
<P>"Every foreign citizen will have a certain status in Iraq," he said.
<P>A civilian official in the U.S. occupation authority said some security 
contractors have begun to ask about their status after June 30, particularly 
since the campaign of violence by insurgents. But it is unlikely that the 
interim Iraqi government would seek to arrest civilian security personnel or 
interfere with their work, the official said.
<P>"Are some Iraqi security people going to move in and arrest our cooks and 
bottle washers?" he said. "I don't think so."</p>
