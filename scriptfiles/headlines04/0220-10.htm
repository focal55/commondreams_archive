<P>LOS ANGELES  - Veteran TV journalist, author and  social commentator Bill Moyers plans to leave his weekly PBS  magazine "Now" after the elections to write a book about his  former boss, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the public  broadcasting network said on Thursday.

				
<P>The Oklahoma-born Moyers, 69, who began his journalism  career as a teenage cub reporter for a small-town Texas  newspaper, served as a special assistant to Johnson during his  term in the U.S. Senate and later worked in the LBJ White  House, including two years as press secretary.

				
<P>Ordained as a Baptist minister, Moyers also served as  deputy director of the Peace Corps in President John F.  Kennedy's administration. In more recent years, Moyers' name  has periodically been floated by political progressives who  have sought to draft him to run for president.

				
<P>During a 32-year broadcasting career, Moyers established  himself as one of the leading storytellers and cultural  anthologists in television journalism, exploring topics ranging  from government and politics to religion, poetry and myth.

				
<P>"I learned a long time ago that there is a season for  everything. My 'season' in public broadcast has lasted 32  years," Moyers said in a brief statement. "It's finally time to  move on to some other pursuits that I want to accomplish while  there are still enough grains of sand in the top of the  hourglass."

				
<P>PBS spokeswoman Lea Sloan said Moyers planned to stay on as  host of "Now with Bill Moyers" through the upcoming  presidential race before leaving to write his book.

				
<P>PROGRAM'S FUTURE BEING DISCUSSED

				
<P>"Now," which debuted in January 2002, airs Friday nights at  8:30 p.m. and draws an average audience of 2.6 million viewers  a week, mixing in-studio interviews with investigative  reporting.

				
<P>Pat Mitchell, president and chief executive of PBS, said  the network was in discussions with the show's executive  producer, John Siceloff, about the future of the program, which  has been co-hosted for several months by former public radio  host David Brancaccio.

				
<P>After a stint in government, Moyers left Washington to  become publisher of the Newsday newspaper on Long Island in the  late 1960s, then took to the national airwaves in 1970 as host  of "Bill Moyers' Journal" on PBS.

				
<P>He later moved to CBS as a commentator, contributing to the  "Evening News with Dan Rather."
<P>Two attempts to launch his own prime-time program on CBS  failed to achieve sufficient ratings, and Moyers returned to  PBS in 1986, joining his wife, Judith Anderson, to form Public  Affairs Television to produce his own programs.

				
<P>Among the documentary series he created and hosted were  such titles as "In Search of the Constitution," "God and  Politics,"  "World of Ideas," "The Power of the Word," "The  Public Mind" and "Listening to America with Bill Moyers."

				
<P>Many became successful books. One of them, based on the  work of scholar Joseph Campbell, "Joseph Campbell and the Power  of Myth," was on the New York Times bestseller list for more  than a year.

				
<P>In 1995, Moyers also briefly joined NBC News as a senior  analyst and commentator and the following year became the first  host of sister cable network MSNBC's "Insight" program.
