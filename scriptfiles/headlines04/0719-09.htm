<p>Over Sunday dinner, the Bay Area progressive choir gathered in 382 
house parties from Piedmont to San Francisco's Bayview to nod along to the 
latest political season documentary  --  this one ridiculing archnemesis Fox 
News.
<P>This 80-minute film, however, may never do what movies are supposed to do:
Play in theaters. It may not even get to TV.

That's where the house parties come in. They're the focus of the 
marketing campaign for "<a href="http://www.outfoxed.org/" target="_new">Outfoxed</a>." Made for a Hollywood-paltry $300,000, 
"Outfoxed" is the latest entry in the suddenly hot market for political films. 
With the box-office smash "Fahrenheit 9/11" and the just-released "The Hunting 
of the President," portraying a right-wing cabal trying to take down Bill 
Clinton, and a new Resistance Cinema series in the East Bay, much of the 
politically conscious Bay Area seems to be spending time in large, darkened 
rooms.
<P>"Outfoxed" --  largely funded and distributed by the 2.2 million members 
of Berkeley-birthed liberal online hub MoveOn.org  --  is adding an under-the-
radar twist.
<P>The filmmakers turned the century-old film distribution model upside down 
by premiering the documentary Sunday at more than 3,000 house parties 
nationwide. And while director Robert Greenwald is talking to a cable company 
and hopes for a theatrical release, he's relying on word of mouth and the 
Internet to sell what he hopes will be more than 100,000 DVDs of the film at 
about $10 each.
<P>In December, relying on the same channels and with no mainstream 
advertising and less advance buzz, Greenwald's "<a href="http://www.truthuncovered.com/" target="_new">Uncovered: The Whole Truth 
About the Iraq War</a>" sold 120,000 DVDs. 
<P>After costs were paid, Greenwald used the leftover cash to give 10,000 
copies of "Uncovered" DVDs to San Francisco punk rock label head Fat Mike to 
distribute on a Bush-bashing musical tour. Thanks to the resultant buzz, 
"Uncovered" will have its theatrical release in San Francisco, New York and a 
few other large cities in August. His next film  -- "Unconstitutional," about 
civil liberties violations since Sept. 11  --  is set to be ready for home 
viewing in September.
<P>"There's a real hunger out there for stuff of substance about the 
critical issues of the day," said Greenwald, an Emmy-nominated director best 
known for transforming Farrah Fawcett into a serious actress in the 1984 TV 
movie "The Burning Bed."
<P>The "Outfoxed" distribution method, he said, "is the best way to get the 
material out there quickly."
<P>And it means avoiding the politics that caused Disney Corp. to decline to 
distribute Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11." MoveOn.org, the liberal think 
tank Center for American Progress and a loan from Greenwald financed "Outfoxed.
"
<P>The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks transformed Greenwald, a 58-year-old 
native New Yorker. In the past two years, he's moved beyond the land of TV 
biopics on Natalie Cole that made him financially secure to do quickly 
assembled, pointed documentaries, beginning with "Unprecedented: The 2000 
Presidential Election."
<P>Last year, he became interested in what he heard journalists describing 
as the "Foxification" of the news. He began a near-24-hour-a-day monitoring of 
the cable news channel, looking for signs of partisanship beneath the 
network's "fair and balanced" slogan.
<P>Helped by 10 MoveOn.org members who volunteered to watch Fox News 
constantly (their motto: "We watch Fox so you don't have to"), and a study on 
the network's bias by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, Greenwald concluded 
"that Fox isn't a conservative network. It's a Republican network."
<P>Greenwald stocks the film with interviews with former employees and memos 
from Fox executives with trickle-down coverage suggestions on everything from 
the Sept. 11 commission to the war in Iraq.
<P>In a statement, Fox News criticized the film, saying "the former low-
level Fox employees (in the film) are hardly worth addressing. Some left 
because of incompetence, and none expressed concern about editorial policy 
while employees."
<P>That didn't matter to the 30 people who attended a house party in 
Piedmont, as they groaned at the antics of Fox commentator Bill O'Reilly.
<P>Many were like Peter Harvey. He has unplugged from the network news grid, 
getting his news from Link TV and Free Speech TV. 
<P>"I'm here for moral support,'' said Harvey, a 49-year-old Piedmont 
resident. "And usually at these kinds of things, we pull out the checkbook.''
<P>Eve Ogden brought her husband, who is leaning toward voting for President 
Bush again, in the hope "that he has a sliver of an open mind.''
<P>After seeing "Outfoxed,'' the 53-year-old Brent Ogden of Piedmont said, 
"It's a brilliant movie. I don't think it changes my politics, but it's a 
great commentary on the news. If all the channels were like Fox, the world 
would be like (the television show) Max Headroom.'' 
<P>But will this film resonate beyond the Bay Area choir? (The region 
rivaled New York for the national lead in sheer number of house parties.) 
That's not necessarily Greenwald's concern.
<P>"I think there's a real value in energizing the choir," he said. "This 
film isn't about defeating Bush. It's about showing the danger of what happens 
when corporations control news coverage."
<P>Moriah Kinberg, who helped put together a free "Resistance Cinema" series 
in Oakland, which premiered Sunday with a screening of Pacifica Radio 
commentator Amy Goodman's media critique, "Independent Media in a Time of War,
" said such films can rally support in a way that, say, a demonstration can't.
<P>"It can be hard to get people to come out to a protest march," said 
Kinberg, an organizer with the anti-war group Not In Our Name. "But going to 
the movie seems safer. It can be more passive. If you want to stay and talk 
about it afterwards, you can."
<P>Before opening night screenings of "Fahrenheit 9/11" last month, 
Democratic Party supporters waded through the crowd passing out buttons and 
asking for donations  --  in the political tepid-bed of Lafayette.
<P>Other progressives, however, say popcorn activism isn't enough.
<P>"What people have to realize that going to see 'Fahrenheit 9/11' doesn't 
mean that you've participated in social change," said Don Hazen, executive 
director of San Francisco-based progressive news site AlterNet, which co-
hosted an early screening of "Outfoxed" Friday in San Francisco; Greenwald is 
a board member of AlterNet's parent organization, the Independent Media 
Institute.
<P>"Sorry," Hazen said. "You've got to get outside of San Francisco. Go talk 
to a friend in Reno. Or Las Vegas. Someplace where they don't think the same 
as here."
