BAGHDAD  - Iraqis reacted with weary skepticism  Tuesday to promises from President Bush of a peaceful and  independent future.
<p> 
			
			Iraq's defense minister said he wanted U.S. troops out  within the year, to be replaced by newly trained Iraqi forces.<p> 
			
			In a televised address to assure increasingly doubtful  American voters that his project in Iraq was on track, Bush  said U.S. forces would stay on and even be reinforced to  stabilize the country after a handover of formal power to an  interim government on June 30 and Iraqi elections in the new  year.<p> 
			
			Shortly before Bush spoke, Washington asked the United  Nations to endorse a plan that would give U.S. forces an  open-ended mandate to stay in Iraq, renewable in a year.<p> 
			
			But Iraqis, from the streets of Baghdad to the ranks of the  U.S.-installed administration, made clear they wanted a final  end to 14 irksome months of occupation as soon as possible.<p> 
			
			"In terms of the timeline for the presence of multinational  forces to help us establish security and stability, I think it  will be a question of months rather than years," Iraqi Defense  Minister Ali Allawi said in London. He said Iraqi forces would  probably be ready to step in before the mandated year was up.<p> 
			
			It is an ambitious timetable but echoes the feelings of  many Iraqis.<p> 
			
			"Bush is a scorpion. He is a liar. He is sneaky, making all  kinds of promises when he just wants to control Iraq," said  Ayman Haidar, a policeman on duty in Baghdad.<p> 
			
			ABU GHRAIB TO GO<p> 
			
			Welcomed by many Iraqis as liberators from Saddam Hussein,  U.S. troops now face frustration among people tired of violence  and economic hardship in one of the world's most oil-rich  nations. Many are also furious at soldiers' abuse of prisoners.<p> 
			
			Bush said he would demolish Saddam's former torture center  at Abu Ghraib, outside Baghdad, which has become newly  notorious as the site of humiliating torments inflicted by  American troops on naked and terrified inmates and captured on  camera.<p> 
			
			Among protesters outside Abu Ghraib Tuesday, Hussein Omeer  said: "The problem is not with the building but what goes on  inside. We want them to change the rules, not pull down the  building."<p> 
			
			Bush said that violence, like the assassination of the head  of the Iraqi Governing Council last week and a Shi'ite  uprising, would likely get worse during the transition to Iraqi  rule.<p> 
			
			There are difficult days ahead and the way forward may  sometimes appear chaotic," said Bush, whose sliding job  approval ratings are raising questions about his re-election  chances in November.<p> 
			
			U.S. tanks were in action before dawn south of the capital  Tuesday, battling Shi'ite Mehdi Army fighters around the town  of Kufa. At least 11 people were killed and 22 wounded,  hospital staff in Kufa and the nearby holy city of Najaf said.<p> 
			
			A doorway at the holiest Shi'ite Muslim shrine, Najaf's  Imam Ali mosque, was slightly damaged by what appeared to be  rockets or mortars.<p> 
			
			Aides to radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said  several people were hurt in the incident likely to upset  believers across the Middle East. It was not clear which side  fired the explosives.<p> 
			
			FRANCE WANTS CHANGES<p> 
			
			A soldier whose death Monday was announced Tuesday was at  least the 580th American to die in combat since the invasion. A  leader of Iraq's Turkmen minority was assassinated in a  drive-by shooting in the northern city of Kirkuk, police said.<p> 
			
			At least two people were wounded in Baghdad, police said,  when a car blew up outside the Karma hotel, used by foreigners  and near the embassy of Australia, a close U.S. ally in Iraq.<p> 
			
			The draft U.N. resolution, distributed by the United States  and Britain, is expected to be broadly adopted.<p> 
			
			France and Russia, which opposed the war, want unspecified  changes and said the transfer of power must be genuine. "It is  a draft -- a draft which should be discussed and improved,"  French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier said Tuesday.<p> 
			
			Germany, another war opponent, called Washington's plans "a  good basis" for consensus. An Iraqi party headed by Ahmed  Chalabi, a former U.S. favorite now openly hostile to  Washington, said Tuesday the draft U.N. resolution did not give  Iraqis enough.<p> 
			
			U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was due to name a government in  a week or so, representing Iraq's various communities.<p> 
			
			A Washington Post-ABC poll Tuesday showed Bush's approval  rating down four points in a month at 47 percent. Only four  voters in 10 approved of his Iraq policy, the lowest ever, and  65 percent thought the United States was "bogged down" in Iraq.
