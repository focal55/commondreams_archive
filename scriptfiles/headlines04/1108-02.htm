<p>NEAR FALLUJA, Iraq  - U.S. planes and artillery  fiercely bombarded Falluja and troops probed rebel defenses on  Monday in a prelude to a full-scale ground offensive on Iraq's  toughest insurgent bastion.<p> 
			
			This reporter witnessed about eight air strikes within 20  minutes. Explosions from the artillery fire boomed out every  minute or so as plumes of smoke rose from the city.<p>

U.S.-led troops backed by tanks and aircraft also battled  guerrillas around the Sunni Muslim city west of Baghdad, moving  to forward positions ahead of an expected attack.<p> 
			
			Al Qaeda ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi called on Muslims to  take up arms against America. "Oh people, the war has begun and  the call for jihad (holy war) has been made," he said in a  statement posted on a Web site often used by Islamist  militants.<p> 
			
			Zarqawi's appeal did not mention Falluja by name. The U.S.  military says fighters loyal to him are holed up in the city  along with Iraqi insurgents loyal to Saddam Hussein.<p> 
			
			Guerrillas hit back in Baghdad, where a suicide bomber blew  up his red Opel car near a U.S. convoy on the main airport  road, killing at least three people, witnesses said.<p> 
			
			A Reuters photographer saw U.S. soldiers taking three  bodies from a white four-wheel-drive vehicle wrecked in the  blast and loading them on stretchers into a military ambulance.  The U.S. military had no word on casualties.<p> 
			
			A police source said earlier that at least two Iraqis had  been killed, one of them a woman. Bystanders said the white  vehicle had carried officials and foreign security guards.<p> 
			
			Iraq's interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi declared 60 days  of emergency rule on Sunday to rein in an insurgency that  threatens planned nationwide elections in January and said  retaking Falluja could not be delayed much longer.<p> 
			
			An AC-130 gunship struck Falluja with cannon fire and  machineguns and a heavy bomb dropped in the northwest sent up a  column of smoke. Smoke also billowed from a western area.<p> 
			
			U.S. forces gathered on two sides of the city where they  say 1,000 to 6,000 rebels and foreign fighters are entrenched.<p> 
			
			Iraqi and U.S. troops seized Falluja's main hospital,  blindfolding several people and kicking down doors but not  firing a shot. Before the hospital's telephone lines were cut,  staff said several patients and workers were detained. MASKED  GUERRILLAS<p> 
			
			Inside the city, masked guerrillas roamed empty streets  with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Reuters  Television footage showed one man in the western Jolan district  firing a grenade launcher at an unidentified target.<p> 
			
			Men wept as they buried seven white-shrouded bodies, some  of them fighters, in a narrow trench in Falluja's makeshift  graveyard in a former soccer stadium, the footage showed.<p> 
			
			Heavy fighting erupted on the city's eastern and western  fringes, including near a bridge over the Euphrates river.<p> 
			
			Witnesses in Falluja said the Americans were using  amphibious vehicles to try to cross the river but were coming  under heavy fire from guerrillas entrenched in the city.<p> 
			
			"These insurgents are going to get a lot more than they  bargained for," said U.S. Gunnery Sergeant Christopher Garza.<p> 
			
			Guerrillas in other Iraqi cities and towns have stepped up  attacks to show their muscle, killing at least 60 people in  weekend violence that mostly targeted the security forces.<p> 
			
			Zarqawi's group claimed responsibility for most of the  assaults, including those that killed 34 people and wounded 49  in the restive city of Samarra, north of Baghdad, on Saturday.<p> 
			
			U.S. planes bombed targets in the Jubairiya area just north  of Samarra on Monday, killing one person and wounding four,  police and hospital officials said.<p> 
			
			U.S. and Iraqi forces stormed Samarra in early October to  clear out insurgents in what was seen at the time as a pilot  operation for larger assaults in Falluja and Ramadi, but  Saturday's violence showed the city is far from pacified.
			<p> 
			
			Allawi said emergency law measures could be imposed  anywhere in Iraq, except for Kurdistan in the north, to ensure  security before the Jan. 27 elections President Bush says will  be a cornerstone in building a democratic Iraq.
