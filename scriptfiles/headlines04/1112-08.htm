<p>LOS ANGELES - Michael Moore plans a follow-up to "Fahrenheit 9/11," his hit documentary that assails President Bush  over the handling of the Sept. 11 attacks and the war on terrorism, according to a Hollywood trade paper.

<p>Moore told Daily Variety that he and Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax boss who produced the film, hope to have "Fahrenheit 9/11 1/2" ready in two to three years.

<p>"Fifty-one percent of the American people lacked information (in this election) and we want to educate and enlighten them," Moore was quoted in Thursday's edition of Variety. "They weren't told the truth. We're communicators and it's up to us to start doing it now."

<p>A spokesman for Fellowship Adventure Group, formed by Weinstein and brother Bob to help distribute "Fahrenheit 9/11," did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

<p>"Fahrenheit 9/11," which won top honors at May's Cannes Film Festival, became the first documentary to top $100 million at the domestic box office. Moore, who won the documentary Academy Award for "Bowling for Columbine," is pushing "Fahrenheit 9/11" in the best-picture category for the upcoming Oscars.

<p>The issues for the follow-up film will remain the same, Iraq  and terrorism, Moore said.

<p>"The official mourning period is over today and there is a silver lining: George W. Bush is prohibited by law from running again," Moore said. <p align="center">&copy; 2004 AP</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
