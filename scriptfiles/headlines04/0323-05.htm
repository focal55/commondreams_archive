<p>The mourners in tow behind the mutilated body of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin - some chanting their desire to swiftly follow him in death, others shuffling silently in contemplation - found unspoken agreement on what will follow the assassination of Hamas's spiritual leader.
<p>Sheikh Yassin, they predicted, will reach from beyond the grave to claim many more lives in death than he ever did in providing the religious and nationalist rationalization for the suicide bombers.  
<p>"Have you seen a dead man walk?" asked Adel, a professor at the Islamic university, as the largest funeral procession in years worked its way through Gaza City. "Israel will find out that there is a man who can kill more Israelis when he is dead than when he was alive. And that man is Sheikh Yassin."

Threats to plunge Israel into hell are standard fare after the now regular assassinations of Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, and sometimes their leaders. But the killing of Sheikh Yassin generated a different kind of anger yesterday.  
<p>The assassination was not unexpected. Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, had said no one was immune from targeting by the guided missiles fired from helicopters high above Gaza.  
<p>The military had tried and failed to kill Sheikh Yassin last September.  
<p>But when it came, many Gazans saw the attack as a cowardly execution of a frail old man in a wheelchair who did not attempt to hide.  
<p>"He was 67 years old and very ill," said Adel. "He would have died anyway in two or three months, I'm sure. Why bring fire on yourself? I want every Israeli to ask themselves that question. They are very stupid. I really don't understand them."  
<p>Sheikh Yassin was halfway along the street that leads from his home in the Sabra area of Gaza City to the Mujamma al-Islamia mosque about 200 yards away when the first of three rockets struck.  
<p>Usama Abdelal owns a grocery store opposite the mosque. He had heard the military drones overhead the previous day, presumably beaming pictures of the Hamas leader's movements to those who were planning his death.  
<p>"I was sleeping when the rockets hit. I ran straight into the street and saw him. He must have been killed instantly because part of his head was blown off and his body was cut into three parts. We were sure straight away that it was him because of the wheelchair," he said. "Some people were killed with Sheikh Yassin but others were killed when they ran to help him and another rocket exploded. He was an easy target. He came to the mosque every day at the same time."  
<p>Among the dead was one of Mr Abdelal's cousins who lived in the street and a more distant relative who worked as a bodyguard for the Hamas leader.  
<p>Beside Sheikh Yassin's mutilated body lay the remnants of his wheelchair. One of the wheels had disappeared altogether but the other was still attached to the seat.  
<p>Gazans show a unique reverence for Sheikh Yassin distinct from the anger over the assassination of other Hamas leaders.  
<p>"He will leave a gap. It's more a psychological gap and we will never forget him. Hamas will not produce another man like Sheikh Yassin. This man we really respected and loved," said Mr Abdelal.  
<p>With dawn, a thick black acrid cloud rose over Gaza city as word of the killing spread and thousands of people demonstrated their anger by burning tires.
<p>Gazans said the funeral was the largest in nearly a decade. The procession carrying the body - so mutilated it was placed in a closed makeshift coffin - stretched for blocks as it snaked through the heart of Gaza City from a mosque to the cemetery.  
<p>The green flags of Hamas and the black and gold of Islamic Jihad fluttered over the mourners. Boys on bicycles weaved through the crowd.  
<p>Some of the marchers were roused by blaring loudspeakers: "You have to resist, you have to continue the struggle for freedom. It is our hope to die for freedom."  
<p>Others chanted replies to a question. "What is your movement? Hamas. Who is your leader? Yassin. What is your aim? To be killed."
<p>And some walked in silence. Among them were hundreds of men in black balaclavas and green bandannas bearing automatic rifles and rocket propelled grenades.
<p>What remained of Sheikh Yassin was lifted from the bloodied wooden coffin and lowered into a narrow slit carved out of the hillside cemetery. Some of the mourners piled on the earth until a small mound and two breeze blocks marked either end of a tiny grave that could easily have been mistaken for that of a child.
<p>There were prayers and gunfire but no eulogy. Some of the crowd stayed around. Young boys pointed a finger to their foreheads, made a sound like a gun and said: "Sharon."
<p>But most people drifted back to their homes past the shuttered shops. The bonfires burned out and the streets were soon deserted. Gazans were left to reflect on the only seeming certainty of Sheikh Yassin's death: it will not stop the bloodshed.</p>
