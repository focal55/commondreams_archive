<p>SANTIAGO, Chile  -- Plans for a state dinner for President Bush at Chile's presidential palace were scratched Sunday after the United States insisted on security measures that Chile called unacceptable.

<!--/endimage/-->The change came a day after Chilean security guards temporarily blocked one of Bush's Secret Service agents from entering an official dinner.

<p>For the Sunday event, the Secret Service insisted all guests -- totaling more than 230 -- pass through a metal detector, a top level Chilean Foreign Ministry official told CNN. U.S. officials did not dispute this account.

<p>President Ricardo Lagos believed the measure was humiliating for guests, the Chilean official said.

<p>Instead, Bush will attend a small dinner of about 20 people in Lagos' private dining room.

<p>Bush's security at the 21-nation summit has been a big story in Chile, where many have complained the security measures are excessive. U.S. officials have said the measures are necessary to protect a U.S. president when traveling.

<p>The Saturday incident was captured on camera and shown around the world.

<p>Bush was posing for photos with first lady Laura Bush in the Estacion Mapocho Cultural Center when he heard a commotion and saw that one of his plainclothes security agents was being forcefully restrained from entering.

<p>Bush reached into a small crowd, where people were arguing and pushing one another, and pulled the agent through the door of center. (Full story)

<p>Bush then turned around, cocked his head proudly at his maneuver and began to greet his hosts.

<p>The White House downplayed the incident as an unfortunate misunderstanding with Chilean security services.

<p>U.S. officials insisted the change in Sunday's dinner plans did not reflect any tension in U.S.-Chile relations.
