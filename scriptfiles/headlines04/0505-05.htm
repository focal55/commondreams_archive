<p>These days, mad cow disease is ever with us, so I was off to lunch 

to meet John Stauber, who's been described by "Fast Food Nation'' author Eric 

Schlosser as "[one] of America's bravest, finest journalists."

<P>And, since Stauber earned this accolade in part by co-writing "Mad Cow U.

S.A.," a book that, seven years ago, warned we weren't doing nearly enough to 

prevent mad cow disease in this country, I was meeting him at Greens.

<P>Stauber, founder and director of the Center for Media and Democracy in 

Madison, Wis., claimed I'd be able to recognize him by his Green Bay Packers 

regalia, but somewhat unsurprisingly this turned out not to be true. He was, 

instead, a slightly preppy, bespectacled, academic-looking guy, and I spotted 

him because he was carrying a copy of another of his books, "Weapons of Mass 

Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq"; apart from his role 

as a critic of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's handling of mad cow 

disease, Stauber is a dogged critic of the administration.

<P>

As we sat down, I confessed I'd been living in Britain when mad cow 

disease  --  then officially deemed not transmissible to humans  --  had been 

found there, and had occasionally eaten such things as steak and kidney pie.

<P>"How's your memory?" joked Stauber. 

<P>Please, please say he was joking.

<P>We studied the menu  --  which, appropriately, featured nothing higher on 

the food chain than a legume  --  and Stauber explained he'd first become 

concerned about mad cow disease when, in the early 1990s, he was involved in 

research aimed at making a case against the use of bovine growth hormone. The 

hormone itself was artificially manufactured in laboratories, but a scientist 

told Stauber that cows injected with it were also fed protein supplements made,

in part, of other cows  --  something Stauber found disturbing.

<P>"I started researching mad cow, and in 1993 our organization filed the 

first legal petition to try to get the U.S. to put in place the sort of animal 

feed regulations that were being advocated by the World Health Organization," 

said Stauber. "One of the ironies was that the scientists who were in the 

forefront of advocating a ban on feeding cattle to cattle were U.S. scientists 

like Dr. Joe Gibbs and Dr. [D. Carleton] Gajdusek. But here in the U.S. 

absolutely nothing was done until 1997." 

<P>Stauber convinced Sheldon Rampton  --  with whom he'd already written 

"Toxic Sludge is Good For You" and "Trust Us, We're Experts!"  --  that they 

should start work on a book about mad cow disease (more properly known as 

bovine spongiform  encephalopathy or BSE). Here, he argued, was "a case study 

in how a critically important disease spread through food  --  rather than 

being dealt with with science and with a precautionary, science-based approach 

to protect human health  --  is being dealt with as a crisis management public 

relations problem." 

<P>Rampton and Stauber's "Mad Cow U.S.A" was first published in 1997 with 

the ominous subtitle "Could it happen here?" Now that question has been 

answered, and the book has been newly re-issued with a back cover line reading,

"The book that predicted it." 

<P>"We wrote it very carefully because we realized that at that time nobody 

knew how many people were going to die of human mad cow disease," said Stauber.

"No one still has the answer to that question, and we won't really have the 

answer maybe for decades."

<P>It's now accepted that BSE is caused by a misfolded protein, or prion; 

the disease's incubation period is unpredictable. "What amazed me was there 

was this infectious protein that was fatal, and you could die of this 40 years 

after ingesting the protein," said Stauber. He ordered a green salad and black 

bean chili; I chose the menu's current version of griddle cakes.

<P>"In 1996, when Britain announced people were dying, it didn't surprise me 

in the slightest," he added. "Why wouldn't people die of this disease?"

<P>The outbreak in Britain meant there was plenty of interest in BSE and its 

human form, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Former cattle rancher Howard 

Lyman wrote the well-received "Mad Cowboy," while Stauber and Rampton's book 

was somewhat overshadowed by the release of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist 

Richard Rhodes' "Deadly Feasts: The 'Prion' Controversy and the Public's 

Health"  --  another book you'll want to keep in mind as a fun beach read. 

<P>But public discussion of whether BSE would emerge here all but died after 

Oprah Winfrey invited Lyman on her show and devoted an hour to the disease. 

The two were sued by a group of Texas cattlemen under a state law banning the 

"disparagement" of food  --  and while Winfrey and Lyman prevailed in the 1998 

trial, the whole incident made lots of other people nervous. 

<P>"Mad Cow U.S.A." went out of print, but Stauber and Rampton decided to 

make it available as a free download. Then came Dec. 23, 2003, the day mad cow 

disease was found in the United States, and over the course of the next month 

or so, the book was downloaded 80,000 times. 

<P>And Stauber  --  who sends out periodic mad cow e-mail updates, though he 

and Rampton have also just released a new book, "Banana Republicans"  --  

believes much more has to be done. "You may not be a vegetarian, but the 

animals you eat need to be," he said. "We're still not following that axiom."
