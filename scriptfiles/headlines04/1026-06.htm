<p>BAGHDAD --
Bush administration officials have drawn a consistent picture of the 
insurgents they have been fighting in the past 17 months of occupation: 
religious extremists, "dead-enders" associated with Saddam Hussein and foreign 
terrorists slipping across the country's porous borders.
<P>But a wide range of interviews with Iraqis and U.S. officials here paints 
a starkly different portrait  --  a growing, intensely nationalist resistance 
determined to remove U.S. forces and their Iraqi allies.
<P>"Rather than vilifying those who don't like us and rather than simplistic 
rhetoric, shouldn't we be trying to understand what's going on, what many 
Iraqis are thinking and try to address their concerns?" said an American 
adviser in Baghdad, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
<P>"Of course there are some terrible elements  --  there are, clearly, some 
al Qaeda adherents and some who use terrorist methods as well as some garden-
variety criminal elements  --  but I just don't think it's good to categorize 
them all as 'terrorists.' "
<P>Iraqi critics say U.S. failure to distinguish between different elements 
of the resistance has hampered its ability to secure the peace. 
<P>"One of the basic mistakes the coalition made was misdescribing those who 
had decided to take up arms against the coalition and now the current interim 
Iraqi government," says Sharif Ali bin Hussein, heir to Iraq's deposed king 
and head of Iraq's main monarchist party.
<P>"The resistance is basically from groups that were marginalized and 
disenfranchised by the political process in Iraq when the United States 
decided to impose its exile friends from abroad without giving a role to 
ordinary Iraqis after liberation," he said.
<P>Publicly, U.S. officials reject the notion that the resistance is being 
nourished primarily by Iraqi nationalism, or that it is growing. 
<P>"I don't think the resistance is spreading," said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. 
John DeFreitas. "There are a lot of places in Iraq that have bought into the 
political process. And they're participating. That's a form of nationalism 
also. I don't buy the idea that the resistance is nationalistic. Someone may 
jump up and attack and say that this is for Iraq. That doesn't make it so." 
<P>One counterinsurgency specialist based in Baghdad suggested there was "a 
marriage of convenience" between followers of Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-
Zarqawi, criminals and some armed fighters. 
<P>In private conversations, however, some U.S. diplomats and military 
officials say they have begun to distinguish between fighters such as the 
Shiite Mahdi Army, loyal to rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, and groups like 
Zarqawi's, which have no interest in Iraq's future stability.
<P>"We look at them all as forces from a simple perspective," one U.S. 
general said at a recent background briefing. "From my perspective, they're 
all threat forces. The motivation is different; the attacks are very similar."
<P>Iraqi politicians say that the occupation authorities' focus on foreign 
terrorists as the main element in the insurgency leads to dangerous 
miscalculations. They cite an attack last month on the northern Iraqi city of 
Tal Afar, a mostly ethnic Turkoman town crushed by the U.S. military in a 
battle that left at least 120 people dead and 200 injured. 
<P>U.S. forces, saying they were barraged by attacks from the area, blamed 
foreign fighters who had infiltrated a once-peaceful city. But Iraqis say the 
residents themselves had taken up arms, angered by months of U.S. raids on 
houses, arrests of innocent people and collective punishment.
<P>"The situation was escalating," said Talat al-Wazan, an Iraqi nationalist 
politician based in Baghdad. "The people would go to police stations and ask 
for their relatives and hear nothing."
<P>Tribal leaders telephoned Songul Shapouk, a Turkoman who serves on the 
National Assembly, and promised to turn over any foreign fighters to coalition 
forces, she said. Shapouk pleaded with Iraqi ministers and U.S. officials to 
halt the attack. 
<P>"We told (the Americans), there are not foreign fighters there," said 
Shapouk. "Don't attack this city. They are farmers. They are simple people."
<P>Mohammad Qasoob Younis al-Jabouri, a leader of the Iraq Coalition Party, 
and a delegation of several other Iraqis traveled to the city, hoping to 
persuade the people to turn over any foreign extremists and stave off an 
attack, he said in a telephone interview from his home in Mosul.
<P>But instead of encountering foreign religious fundamentalists, he found 
only his fellow countrymen  --  about 70 fighters armed with Kalashnikovs and 
rocket-propelled grenades. Though he could not see all the insurgents, he knew 
the ones he met were locals because they all spoke Afriya, a Turkoman dialect 
infused with Kurdish and Arab words that is unique to the people of Tal Afar. 
The Turkoman are the third-largest ethnic group in Iraq after the Kurds and 
Arabs. 
<P>"There were no Syrians or Jordanians or foreigners," Jabouri said in a 
telephone conversation. "I saw only Iraqi citizens from Tal Afar."
<P>The U.S. military, unmoved by the politicians' pleas, went ahead with the 
attack, inflicting heavy damage on Tal Afar. In a press release after the 
attack, the U.S. Army 2nd Infantry's Stryker Brigade declared a victory over 
foreign fighters who they said had turned Tal Afar into "a suspected haven for 
terrorists crossing into Iraq from Syria."
<P>But U.S. officials privately conceded recently that no conclusive 
evidence of foreign fighters was found in Tal Afar, or later in Samarra, which 
was reportedly cleared of resistance fighters later in September. 
<P>Iraqi politicians do not dispute that foreign fighters are in their 
country. Posho Ibrahim, Iraq's deputy justice minister, said in an interview 
this month that the U.S. military has about 100 accused foreign fighters in 
custody.
<P>But they do not see the foreigners as the driving force behind the 
resistance.
<P>Sharif, who was among the exiled Iraqi opposition figures who initially 
supported the U.S. invasion, said the typical resistance fighter is a young 
man with a military background who opposes the occupation but  --  unlike the 
foreign fighters motivated by religious extremism  --  is not necessarily anti-
American or anti-Western. 
<P>Wazan said the resistance is led by 20 to 30 armed groups across the 
country.
<P>"This (insurgency) is a justified action for any people whose country is 
under occupation," he said.
