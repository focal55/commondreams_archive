SAN FRANCISCO - California's top election  official will cast an opinion later this week that could have a  major impact on how Americans vote in the future and how  quickly they embrace new balloting technology.
<p> 
			
			California, home to the cutting-edge innovations of Silicon  Valley, was expected to expand the use of new touch-screen  electronic voting machines for the 2004 presidential election.<p> 
			
			Yet last week a state panel looking into glitches in  electronic voting machines from a Diebold Inc. subsidiary  recommended that California not use one of the firm's systems.  By Friday, California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley could  decide to scrap all electronic voting for now.<p> 
			
			"We may have nostalgia for the hanging chads," said Avi  Rubin, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins  University. The author of the first report critical of  touch-screen voting system security, Rubin was referring to the  bits of paper associated with the aging system of punch-card  ballots used in the contested 2000 presidential election.<p> 
			
			Some experts fear that electronic voting will bring  potential problems in the November election with no way to  recount ballots accurately.<p> 
			
			"If there is any question about who wins an election, there  will be no way with most of these electronic systems to go back  and determine the original voter intent," said Linda Franz of  Citizens for Voting Integrity in Washington state.<p> 
			
			The main problem is that current touch-screen machines do  not provide a paper ballot and can not accurately be audited,  said Bev Harris, author of "Black Box Voting: Ballot-Tampering  in the 21st Century."<p> 
			
			Optical-scan machines in which computers read ballots with  filled-in bubbles are more reliable because the paper ballot  can be used in a recount, she said.<p> 
			
			"We have to solve the problem before the fall election,"  Harris said. "Until we do, democracy is in clear and present  danger because we've just dropped the checks and balances."<p> 
			
			During the 2000 presidential election, 16,000 negative or  minus votes temporarily showed up for Al Gore in Volusia  County, Florida, on Diebold optical-scan voting machines,  prompting the TV networks to prematurely call the election for  George W. Bush, Harris said.<p> 
			
			DIEBOLD DISAPPOINTED<p> 
			
			Diebold has expressed disappointment over the California  regulatory panel's recommendation that the state no longer use  certain Diebold electronic voting equipment and said security  problems have been addressed.<p> 
			
			Neither punch-card nor voter lever machines create a  receipt, said Diebold spokesman David Bear, although  touch-screens connected to printers can create a hard copy of  ballots for audits. Critics argue that the print-out could  contain software errors and thus not be an accurate reflection  of the vote.<p> 
			
			"The biggest threat is insider manipulation," said Doug  Jones, a University of Iowa computer science professor who has  examined voting machines in Iowa for a decade. "It's very easy  when you break into the computer system to erase your tracks."<p> 
			
			"I can't deny that a conspiracy could occur," said Bear.  "The likelihood of that occurring is much less likely than  other kinds of disruptions."<p> 
			
			California's Shelley has already mandated that all of the  state's electronic voting machines have a paper trail by 2006.  With such a system, voters should be able to confirm their  votes by looking at a paper ballot, just as bank customers get  receipts from automatic teller machines.<p> 
			
			On Wednesday, his advisory panel that already reviewed the  Diebold machines will make a recommendation on whether to  suspend the use of all electronic voting in 2004.<p> 
			
			"Are they secure?" one of the eight panel members told  Reuters on Monday. "Are we at a point where we have enough time  to adequately continue using them, or do we need to take a step  back for an election and sort of look at the panorama of  everything and explore all the problems and fix them?"<p> 
			
			Shelley is expected to announce his decision on Thursday or  Friday as the deadline to decertify machines before the  November election is May 2. In the past the Democrat has spoken  in favor of electronic voting but his November requirement on  phasing in paper trail requirements suggests he is concerned  about maintaining the integrity of such systems as they become  more widespread.<p> 
			
			Several bills in the U.S. Congress that would require a  voter-verifiable paper ballot are also now pending.
