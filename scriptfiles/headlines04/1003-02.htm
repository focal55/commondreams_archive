<p>VIENNA  - The world's stockpiles of plutonium and  highly enriched uranium useable in atomic weapons are growing,  despite increasing fears about the security of nuclear  materials, a U.S. based think-tank says in a new report.
<p> 
			
The estimates of civilian and military stocks of plutonium  and highly enriched uranium (HEU) -- information treated by  most governments as classified -- were prepared by the  Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), run by  former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright.<p> 
			
			"At the end of 2003, there were more than 3,700 metric tons  of plutonium and highly enriched uranium -- uranium enriched to  20 percent or uranium-235 -- enough for hundreds of thousands  of nuclear weapons, in about 60 countries," Albright and  Kimberly Kramer wrote in an article to be published in the next  issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.<p> 
			
			Most of the weapons-useable material is in Russia, followed  by the United States.<p> 
			
			In response to intelligence reports that terrorists are  interested in acquiring nuclear weapons, the United States and  Russia are working with the U.N. International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) to recover and secure all U.S. and Russian  bomb-grade material spread across the globe.<p> 
			
			Other states with some plutonium or HEU include the other  declared nuclear powers -- Britain, France and China -- as well  as Belgium, Italy, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden,  Switzerland and former nuclear power South Africa, ISIS says.<p> 
			
			North Korea, which withdrew from the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) last year, had some 15 to 39 kg  of plutonium and two to nine nuclear weapons at the end of  2003, according to a table in the article.<p> 
			
			The article says that military plutonium stocks are also  growing in Israel, Pakistan and India -- countries known to  possess nuclear weapons but which have not signed the NPT and  are therefore not subject to IAEA safeguards.<p> 
			
			The fact that states outside the NPT continue to make bomb  material highlights the need for "an international ban on the  production of fissile material for nuclear weapons," it says.<p> 
			
			Albright and Kramer are not optimistic: "Civil plutonium  stocks are not expected to decrease in the next 15 years."<p> 
			
			WORRIES ABOUT SECURITY<p> 
			
			It takes around 10 kg of plutonium-239 or 16-25 kg of HEU  enriched to around 90 percent uranium-235 (U-235) to fuel a  weapon. ISIS estimates that at the end of 2003 there was a  total of 1,855 tonnes of plutonium and 1,900 tonnes of HEU  globally.<p> 
			
			Most of the plutonium was in civilian hands, while the HEU  was mostly in military stocks.<p> 
			
			Some of the weapons-useable nuclear material produced  around the world is disposed of, but the total amount keeps  growing, Albright and Kramer say in their article, an advance  copy of which was provided to Reuters.<p> 
			
			"This is worrisome not only because the world has yet to  come up with an accepted method of plutonium disposition but  also from a security standpoint -- how safe is that plutonium  and HEU?"<p> 
			
			Coastal countries like Ireland, New Zealand and Peru  complain about the security of transporting nuclear materials  through their territorial waters. These countries say that  dangerous shipments of fissile or highly radioactive materials  are often moved through their waters without their knowledge.<p> 
			
			The environmental pressure group Greenpeace says on its Web  site that 140 kg of plutonium -- enough for at least 14 weapons  -- is now en route to France, where it is to be converted into  nuclear reactor MOX fuel.
