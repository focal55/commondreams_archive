He became a pre-election figure for the antiwar movement after appearing in Michael Moore's film "Fahrenheit 9/11" and testifying before congressional panels on Capitol Hill. Henderson said he is an American citizen first and a Marine second, and is opposed to the war because its justification was built on false pretenses.

<P>Speaking to about 150 people in Old Town Square on Sunday, Henderson told the crowd that, despite political losses in November, Americans against the war in Iraq should not stop protesting because they are the only ones left willing to voice dissent.

<P>Henderson said he opposes the war because a decision to invade was based on false intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were ever found.

<P>"We're spending a billion dollars a week to secure a country that was not an imminent threat to us," Henderson said.

<P>With President George W. Bush's re-election and Republicans solidifying a partisan edge in Congress, there will be little attention paid to those against the war, Henderson said.

<P>"I can tell you who does have a voice: You all," he said.

<P>As a Marine, his opposition began to grow after he saw U.S. forces secure oil interests and make little attempt to curb widespread looting in places like Basra and Baghdad in the early days of the war, he said.

<P>Henderson called on the Old Town crowd to leave "Camp Couch" and publicly voice their opposition to the war, despite partisan divides.

<P>People in the crowd said Henderson's message left them with a feeling that not all is lost when it comes to fighting against what they see as an unnecessary war.

<P>"We all have to realize that one individual has the power to create change," said 28-year-old Kristianne Gale, of Fort Collins. Mary Monahan, 50, drove from Greeley to see Henderson speak. She liked his message to leave "Camp Couch" and voice an opinion.

<P>"We have to let (politicians) know that what they are doing is not what we want them to be doing," Monahan said. <p align="center"> Copyright &copy; 2004 The Fort Collins Coloradoan</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
