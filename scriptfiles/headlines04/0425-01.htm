There was no official crowd count, but organizers claimed  more than 1 million people participated.<p> 
			
			Pink- and purple-shirted protesters raised signs reading  "Fight the Radical Right," "Keep Abortion Legal" and "U.S. Out  Of My Uterus" and covered the Mall from the foot of Capitol  Hill to the base of the Washington Monument.<p> 
			
			Speakers ranged from actresses Whoopi Goldberg, Ashley Judd  and Kathleen Turner to philanthropist Ted Turner, feminist icon  Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine  Albright.<p> 
			
			Goldberg raised a wire coat hanger -- a symbol of illegal  abortions in the days before the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs.  Wade ruling recognizing abortion rights -- and told the crowd,  "We are one vote away from going back to this!"<p> 
			
			She was referring to the nine-member high court, which has  frequently decided abortion-related cases on a five-four vote.<p> 
			
			The abortion issue was the centerpiece of the march's broad  protest against the policies of President Bush, including his  stance on funding international family planning. No U.S. funds  may be used for any family planning agency that mentions  abortion to patients.<p> 
			
			"Vote That Smirk Out of Office," was a characteristically  political placard targeting Bush, but Dorothy Smith, 76, of  Eldridge, Missouri, carried an emblem she made herself -- a  wire coat hanger draped with a sign reading "Never Again."<p> 
			
			"I can remember when abortion was just as common as it is  now, but it killed a lot of women," Smith said.<p> 
			
			Major sponsors included stalwarts of the abortion rights  movement -- NARAL Pro-Choice America, Feminist Majority,  National Organization for Women, Planned Parenthood Federation  of America -- as well as the American Civil Liberties Union,  the Black Women's Health Imperative and the National Latina  Institute for Reproductive Health.<p>

Some 1,400 groups attended the event, including an  international contingent with marchers from 57 countries. There  were medical students who carried signs saying they planned to  be the next generation of abortion providers, and there was a  Texas group marching behind a banner that read, "Old Broads for  Choice."<p> 
			
			As the march wound from the Mall toward the White House and  then turned onto Pennsylvania Avenue and toward Capitol Hill,  abortion rights groups encountered anti-abortion protesters.<p> 
			
			These protesters carried posters showing photographs of  fetuses at eight weeks gestation and signs reading "Abortion  Kills Babies."<p> 
			
			March organizers claimed double the turnout of the last big  abortion rights march in 1992, which drew 500,000, according to  the U.S. Park Police, who no longer gives official crowd  counts. The biggest demonstration was an anti-Vietnam War rally  in 1969, which drew 600,000. The largest gathering on the  National Mall was the 1976 U.S. bicentennial celebration.<p> 
			
			Though the march was billed as nonpartisan and included a  contingent called Republicans for Choice, much of the day's  rhetoric was plainly aimed at Bush, a Republican who opposes  abortion in most cases.<p> 
			
			Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry vowed on  Friday to champion abortion rights if elected. He received the  endorsement of Planned Parenthood's Action Fund, the  organization's political fund-raising arm.<p> 
			
			Neither Bush or Kerry attended the march, but U.S. Sen.  Hillary Rodham Clinton, a New York Democrat and former first  lady, drew roars of approval when she exhorted the crowd to  register to vote. Volunteers were on hand to register new  voters.
			<p> 
			
			Bush addressed an anti-abortion march in January, saying  the effort to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade  ruling, which recognized a right to abortion, was "a noble  cause."
