<p>The grandson of famed non-violent leader Mahatma Gandhi says the recent beheading of an American by Islamic terrorists in Iraq is an example of the ``culture of violence'' being perpetuated by both sides of the conflict.</p>
<p>Dr. Arun Gandhi, the founder in 1991 of Memphis, Tenn.-based <a href="http://www.gandhiinstitute.org/" target="_new">M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence</a>, will make two appearances in Bellevue on Friday, May 21. One is a fund-raiser for Habitat for Humanity and the second an interactive session with high school students.</p>
<p>The goal of the noon fund-raiser is to raise $200,000, said Dan Aznoff, a spokesman for Together We Build, sponsor of the event.</p>
<p>In an interview by phone from his Tennessee institute, Gandhi said the recently revealed abuses of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq shows how the culture of violence continues. </p>
<p>``We use any means to promote that culture. The awful things we see are a result of that. So the cycle goes on. You have (executed American) Nick Berg in retaliation. Now we will retaliate and the cycle goes on and expands.''</p>
<p>He said the United States had an opportunity to change the cycle after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but did not take advantage.</p>
<p>``If we had not gone to seek revenge after 9/11 and reached out with the rest of world to improve the lives of the rest of the world, we could have achieved something. But we blew that,'' he said. </p>
<p>``One of the reasons for terrorism is that the (United States') relationship with the rest of the world has not been a good one. That results in the conflict we face today.''</p>
<p>Arun Gandhi, now 70, said he went to live with his grandfather when he was 12 years old and stayed with him for 18 months. His grandfather taught him how to deal with anger, he said.</p>
<p>``He said anger is like electricity. It is positive if used properly but it can be destructive if it's not. We have to use that energy for the good of humanity rather than for destructive purposes,'' said Arun Gandhi, who later wrote a book, called ``Legacy of Love,'' about the time he spent with his grandfather. </p>
<p>``That was a very important lesson. So much of violence in society or our personal lives is generated by anger,'' Arun Gandhi continued. ``If we are able to stop ourselves and use if for a positive purpose we can achieve better results.''</p>
<p>Neither Arun Gandhi nor his grandfather are related to the Gandhi family that has had a hand in ruling India for much of the past 50 years and, on Thursday, appeared poised to resume control of the prime minister's office in the person of Sonia Gandhi. </p>
<p>Born in India in 1869, Mahatma Gandhi developed his method of non-violent civil disobedience, first in support of civil rights in South Africa and later in protests against British rule in India. </p>
<p>Influenced by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy and American writer Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi in turn influenced leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela in South Africa.</p>
<p>Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic in 1948.</p>
