<p>Although the new Iraqi interim government that took office Tuesday 
will not have full authority for another month, it already has the headaches 
of a formidable task  --  gaining enough credibility among Iraqis to be able 
to exercise at least a minimum degree of power.

After days of bruising, behind-the-scenes negotiations involving U.S. 
officials and U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, members of the Iraqi Governing 
Council  --  the 25-member body viewed by a wide spectrum of Iraqis as 
American puppets  --  emerged victorious in re-establishing themselves in the 
new government.
<P>This very success will make it difficult for the leaders who took over on 
Tuesday, many analysts and Iraqis say. They point to the choice for prime 
minister of Iyad Allawi, a controversial businessman and recipient of CIA 
largesse, as particularly likely to spur public dissent.
<P>Allawi's tenure on the Governing Council has prompted widespread rumors 
of corruption and influence peddling, including repeated accusations that he 
charges "commissions" to deliver government contracts to Iraqi companies.
<P>"This is unlikely to be seen by most Iraqis as a legitimate government 
because it wasn't elected by anybody, and I don't think anybody will view it 
as independent," said Juan Cole, a professor of Middle East history at the 
University of Michigan and the author of <a href="http://www.juancole.com/" target="_new">Informed Comment</a>, an authoritative 
Web log about Iraq. "Having an old-time CIA asset be the prime minister seems 
a recipe for derision."
<P>Even analysts who have supported the Bush administration's conduct of the 
Iraq war say Allawi and his Cabinet will have to work hard to dispel Iraqis' 
suspicions.
<P>"The first thing we have to accept is that any Iraqi government and its 
political leaders are going to have to establish credibility with their people 
by being opposed to us," said Eliot Cohen, director of the Strategic Studies 
Program at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies 
in Washington.
<P>"The fact that we had some pet candidates and (the Iraqi Governing 
Council) didn't want them, that's a positive development," said Cohen, 
referring to widespread reports that American diplomats had unsuccessfully 
tried to install a loyal ally on the Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi, to the 
largely ceremonial post of president. Instead, the post went to the council's 
choice, Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer.
<P>"These are not America's puppets," National Security Adviser Condoleezza 
Rice told reporters in Washington.
<P>Allawi and al-Yawer quickly took up the cue, pushing for a bigger slice 
of sovereign authority than the United States has wanted to surrender. In a 
speech Tuesday, Allawi thanked the Bush administration for liberating Iraq 
from the "tyrant" Saddam Hussein, but pointedly said his government would be 
seeking full sovereignty from the United Nations.
<P>Most Iraqis will be looking first at how Allawi negotiates a status of 
forces agreement with U.S. military commanders. That task is not likely to be 
easy because the 138,000 American troops in Iraq have taken over choice real 
estate  --  including the four-square mile Green Zone in the heart of Baghdad. 
The U.S. troops' frequent road closures and checkpoints have angered countless 
Iraqis.
<P>In addition, much depends on whether Allawi tries to rein in U.S. 
counterinsurgency operations and whether he can coax the rebels to lay down 
their  arms. "It's clear that we cannot impose order on that country 
militarily, and what's needed is a different political situation," said Marina 
Ottaway, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 
Washington. "But there's nothing in this government for the people who are 
causing trouble, for the Sunni insurgency, for Muqtada al-Sadr, nothing in 
which they might take part."
<P>Recent public opinion polling has showed a dramatic increase in 
grassroots hostility toward the American occupation. 
<P>Between October and April, the percentage of Iraqis viewing the United 
States as an occupier rather than a liberator more than doubled, from 43 
percent to 88 percent, according to the Center for Research, an Iraqi polling 
firm that works for several U.S. contractors. Similarly, the percentage of 
Iraqis wanting U.S. and coalition troops to leave the country immediately rose 
from 17 percent in October to 57 percent in April.
<P>Reports from Iraq in recent days suggest that many ordinary Iraqis have 
become disillusioned with politics altogether and care more about the lack of 
progress in reconstruction  --  the frequent electricity blackouts, mile-long 
gas station lines, high unemployment, rampant crime and frequent guerrilla 
attacks that have confounded hopes that the American occupation would bring 
prosperity.
<P>"Concerning the new government, I can assure you that very few people are 
looking at what is going on (in politics) because the situation is becoming 
worse than it was before," wrote one Baghdad resident, a Shiite who asked not 
to be identified for security reasons, in an e-mail to The Chronicle. "The 
electricity-cutting hours are more these days, there is a shortage in fuel, 
the long lines of cars on gas stations are getting more and more everyday, the 
bombings are more these days, particularly today, there has been many 
explosions today. People think that since the selected president is from the 
Governing Council, so nothing has been changed.
<P>"All what people are concerned about is the living and security, no more, 
no less!"</p>
