<p>BOMBAY - War is devastating health standards around the world as resources are deflected from fighting disease, health activists said ahead of a top anti-globalization forum.
<p><a href="http://phmovement.org/" target="_new">The People's Health Movement</a>, an international pressure group, said Wednesday that more than 30,000 children over the world died of preventable diseases every day.
<p>Nine billion dollars is needed to provide water and sanitation for poor nations, while the global military expenditure was 900 billion dollars a year, said K. Unnikrishnan, spokesman for the movement.
<p>"It is a silent genocide," said Edgar Isch Lopez, a former environment minister of Ecuador who now heads the National Front for People's Health in his country.
