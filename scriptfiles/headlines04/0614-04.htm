<p>The American military launched some 50 air strikes designed to kill specific targets during the Iraq war, it emerged yesterday, but none of them found its mark. 
<p>Instead the air strikes had a high civilian toll, according to military officials serving at the time.  
<p>Until now only a few of the air strikes, such as the use of four 2,000lb "bunker-buster" bombs in an attempt to kill Saddam Hussein at a farm in Masur on March 19, had been made public.  
<p>That air strike, which caused the starting date of the war to be brought forward, has been the subject of speculation, with analysts doubting the reliability of the intelligence used and questioning whether Saddam was at the compound.  
<p>According to the New York Times, a report prepared in December by the pressure group Human Rights Watch, said the decision to go for high-profile strikes against individual Iraqi leaders had "resulted in dozens of civilian casualties that the US could have prevented if it had taken additional precautions".  
<p>A US air force report prepared in April last year also confirms that there were 50 such air strikes, while another report, by the Defense Intelligence Agency last month confirms that all the targets were from the 55-strong list of Iraqi leaders depicted on playing cards distributed to US forces in Iraq.  
<p>Those who escaped the raids included not only Saddam Hussein, but also several Iraqi leaders who are said by the US military to be leading the insurrection against American-led forces. These include General Izzat Ibrahim, who was the number two Iraqi official at the time of the war. He is said by US intelligence to have assume the titular leadership of the insurrection after the detention of Saddam.  
<p>Marc Garlasco, a former intelligence official during the war who now works for Human Rights Watch, described the campaign as an "abject failure".  
<p>"We failed to kill the HVTs (high value targets) and instead killed civilians and engendered hatred and discontent in some of the population," he told the New York Times.  
<p>The attacks using precision-guided weapons took place from March 19 to April 18 2003.  
<p>At least 13 Iraqi leaders were targeted. Often the raids were trumpeted as being successful.  
<p>On April 7 last year, the US Defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, played a video of an attack two days earlier on General Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as "Chemical Ali".  
<p>"We believe that the reign of terror of Chemical Ali has come to an end," said Mr Rumsfeld. But Gen Majid was not captured until August.  
<p>Under US army rules of engagement, Mr Rumsfeld was required to authorize any air strike that was likely to result in the deaths of 30 or more civilians.  
<p>Fifty such attacks were proposed, and approved, according to the air force commander during the war, General Michael Moseley. But attacks that were time-critical were not subject to such a process. Accordingly, says the Human Rights Watch report, "attacks on leadership likely resulted in the largest number of civilian deaths from the air war".
