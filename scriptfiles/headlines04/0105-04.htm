<p>ATLANTA  - The United States began fingerprinting
and photographing visitors from most countries on Monday in a
controversial program to try to prevent potential terrorists
from slipping in through the borders.
<p>
 The program was launched at 115 airports and 14 cruise ship
ports across the country, but not yet at land borders, which
account for a large part of traffic into the United States.
<p>
 Tourists and business travelers on short visits from 27
mostly European nations are exempt from the new measures.
Canadians, who fall under special immigration rules, are also
exempt.
<p>
 Some foreign nationals have complained of discrimination
and Brazil last week began fingerprinting and photographing all
arriving U.S. citizens.
<p>
 Federal officials said the measures, which were ordered by
Congress in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 hijacked plane
attacks, would tighten security without causing any undue
inconvenience to travelers.
<p>
 "It is easy for travelers to use, but hard for terrorists
to avoid," Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge
told a news conference at Atlanta's international airport
shortly after the system began
<p>
 Ridge greeted and shook hands with the first travelers to
be processed in Atlanta under the US-Visit system.
<p>
 Atlanta's airport is said by officials there to be the
world's busiest passenger airport, with an average of 2,400
flights arriving and departing daily.
<p>
 The new fingerprinting and photographing program is meant
to identify people who have violated immigration controls, have
criminal records or belong to groups listed as terrorist
organizations by the United States.
<p>
 At Miami International Airport, which receives a large part
of passenger traffic from Latin America and the Caribbean,
passengers interviewed after going through the process said
they had no problem with the screening, and took no offense.
<p>
 "I think it's good with everything that's going on," said
Scott Murray, a Jamaican arriving at the airport. "If you have
nothing to hide, it shouldn't be a problem. I wasn't offended.
<p>
 "It took not even a minute, it was left and right index
finger on the machine and they take a picture too."
<p>
But the Brazilian fingerprint program of U.S. visitors that
began last Thursday came on the orders of a judge who angrily
compared the new U.S. controls to Nazi horrors.
 <p>
 "I consider the act absolutely brutal, threatening human
rights, violating human dignity, xenophobic and worthy of the
worst horrors committed by the Nazis," said Federal Judge
Julier Sebastiao da Silva in a court order to authorize the
program in Brazil. <p><i>Additional reporting by Jim Loney in Miami</i></p>
