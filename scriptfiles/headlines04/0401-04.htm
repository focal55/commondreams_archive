<p>Days before President George W. Bush’s planned Friday visit to Huntington, Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., called his administration a disaster for West Virginians.
<p>Both senators criticized Bush for failing to create new jobs, refusing to increase the federal minimum wage, cutting overtime pay, and blocking supplemental unemployment benefits for people out of work.</p>
<p>“West Virginians want to work. They don’t want a handout,” Byrd said during a telephone interview on Wednesday. </p>
<p>“But the Bush administration has failed to put forth a job plan that will create opportunities for people. Since he took office, more than two million jobs have been lost.” </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Byrd and Rockefeller called on Congress to extend the federal unemployment insurance for another six months. </p>
<p>That program provides an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits after workers exhaust 26 weeks of state-funded unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>During the first three months of this year, 3,800 West Virginians have exhausted their benefits. By June, that number could top 6,500.</p>
<p>Extending those benefits would provide an economic stimulus of $31 million to West Virginia alone, according to a special report prepared for Byrd and Rockefeller by the House Committee on Government Reform.</p>
<p>Rockefeller said, “Until we get an economic recovery that puts Americans back to work instead of sending jobs overseas, we must continue to extend the unemployment benefits to West Virginians who need them.”</p>
<p>Senate Democrats are also backing legislation to create jobs at home and prevent more jobs from being shipped overseas.</p>
<p>Since Bush became president, West Virginia has lost 11,500 jobs, 10,000 of them in manufacturing, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>Under Bush, 3 million private sector jobs have disappeared nationally, including 2.8 million manufacturing jobs, according to a statement Byrd and Rockefeller released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“When Bush comes to West Virginia this week,” Byrd said during the telephone interview, “the people of West Virginia need to remember he is not family friendly. It is certainly not family-friendly to require workers to work more hours for less pay.”</p>
<p>Byrd and Rockefeller are fighting Bush’s efforts to eliminate overtime pay for as many as 8 million workers, including hundreds of thousands in the health-care industry.</p>
<p>“The president’s overtime proposal would repeal the 40-hour work week created in 1938,” Byrd said. </p>
<p>“Overtime pay often makes the difference between just making ends meet and providing a better life.</p>
<p>“For many families, overtime pay makes up 25 percent of a worker’s wage. That could be used to take care of an elderly parent or a newborn child, to pay unexpected medical costs or to set money aside for a child’s college education.”</p>
<p>The White House, Byrd said, champions “policy after policy, program after program, that take away opportunities for working families.</p>
<p>“The [Bush] administration blocked legislation to increase the minimum wage many times. The minimum wage has been $5.15 an hour for seven years. </p>
<p>“The minimum wage would have to be more than $8 an hour to have the purchasing power the minimum wage had 1968,” Byrd said.</p>
<p>Today, a worker making minimum wage earns $10,700 a year. That’s more than $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three.</p>
<p>“The Bush administration doesn’t have a heart for working families. They needed West Virginia four years ago. They came in and talked to the steelworkers. They came in and talked to the coal miners.</p>
<p>“The votes West Virginia gave them put them in office. They quickly forgot West Virginians. They forgot the promises they made to the steelworkers.</p>
<p>“Now the president is coming back. People ought to remind him of the promises that Bush and Cheney made when they came to West Virginia,” Byrd said. </p>
<p>“This administration is not for working people.”</p>
<p>Byrd also criticized the Bush administration for failing to follow through on its promise to spend $2 billion for clean coal technology programs.</p>

<p>“As soon as we can send this president back to Crawford, Texas, the better off working people in this country are going to be,” Byrd said.</p>
<p>Byrd, who has served in Congress for 51 years, said, “This is the most difficult White House I have had to deal with in my entire career.”</p>
