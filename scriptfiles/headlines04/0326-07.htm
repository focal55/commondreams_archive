<p>WASHINGTON --
This week's testimony and media blitz by former White House 
counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke has returned unwanted attention to his 
former boss, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice.
<P>The refusal by President Bush's top security aide to testify publicly 
before the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks elicited rebukes by 
commission members as they held open hearings this week. Thomas Kean, the 
former New Jersey governor Bush named to be chairman of the commission, said: 
"I think this administration shot itself in the foot by not letting her 
testify in public."
<P>At the same time, some of Rice's rebuttals of Clarke's broadside against 
Bush, which she delivered in a flurry of media interviews and statements 
rather than in testimony, contradicted other administration officials and her 
own previous statements.
<P>Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage contradicted Rice's claim that 
the White House had a strategy before Sept. 11 for military operations against 
al Qaeda and the Taliban. The CIA contradicted Rice's earlier assertion that 
Bush had requested a CIA briefing in the summer of 2001 because of elevated 
terrorist threats. And Rice's assertion this week that Bush had told her on 
Sept. 16, 2001, that "Iraq is to the side" appeared to be contradicted by an 
order signed by Bush on Sept. 17 directing the Pentagon to begin planning 
military options for an invasion of Iraq.
<P>Rice, in turn, has contradicted Vice President Dick Cheney's assertion 
that Clarke was "out of the loop" and his intimation that Clarke had been 
demoted. Rice has also given various conflicting accounts. She criticized 
Clarke for being the architect of failed Clinton administration policies, but 
also said she had retained Clarke so the Bush administration could continue to 
pursue Clinton's terrorism policies.
<P>National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack defended many of 
Rice's assertions, saying that she had been more consistent than Clarke.
<P>Rice so far has refused to provide testimony under oath to the commission 
that could possibly resolve the contradictions. Wednesday night, she told 
reporters, "I would like nothing better in a sense than to be able to go up 
and do this, but I have a responsibility to maintain what is a long-standing 
constitutional separation between the executive and the legislative branch."
<P>The White House, reacting to the public relations difficulties caused by 
the refusal to allow Rice's testimony, asked the commission Thursday to give 
Rice another opportunity to speak privately with panel members to address 
"mischaracterizations of Dr. Rice's statements and positions."
<P>Democratic commission member Richard Ben-Veniste disclosed this week that 
Rice had asked, in her private meetings with the commission, to revise a 
statement she made publicly that "I don't think anybody could have predicted 
that those people could have taken an airplane and slam it into the World 
Trade Center ... that they would try to use an airplane as a missile." Rice 
told the commission that she had misspoken; the commission has received 
information that prior to Sept. 11, U.S. intelligence agencies, and Clarke, 
had talked about terrorists using airplanes as missiles.
<P>In an op-ed essay Monday in the Washington Post, Rice wrote that "through 
the spring and summer of 2001, the national security team developed a strategy 
to eliminate" al Qaeda that included "sufficient military options to remove 
the Taliban regime" including the use of ground forces. 
<P>But Armitage, testifying this week as the White House representative, 
said the military part was not in the plan before Sept. 11. "I think that was 
amended after the horror of 9/11," he said. McCormack said Rice's statement 
was accurate because the team had discussed including orders for such military 
plans to be drawn up.
<P>In the same article, Rice belittled Clarke's proposals by writing: "The 
president wanted more than a laundry list of ideas simply to contain al Qaeda 
or 'roll back' the threat. Once in office, we quickly began crafting a 
comprehensive new strategy to 'eliminate' the al Qaeda network." Rice asserted 
that while Clarke and others provided ideas, "No al Qaeda plan was turned over 
to the new administration." That same day, she said most of Clarke's ideas 
"had been already tried or rejected in the Clinton administration."
<P>But in her interview with NBC two days later, Rice appeared to take a 
different view of Clarke's proposals. "He sent us a set of ideas that would 
perhaps help to roll back al Qaeda over a three- to five-year period; we acted 
on those ideas very quickly. And what's very interesting is that ... Dick 
Clarke now says that we ignored his ideas, or we didn't follow them up."
<P>Asked about this apparent discrepancy, McCormack pointed a reporter to a 
Clarke background briefing in 2002 in which the then-White House aide was 
defending the president's efforts in fighting terrorism.
