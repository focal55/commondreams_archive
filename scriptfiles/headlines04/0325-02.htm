<p>WASHINGTON, March 24 — Standing just down the hall from his old Senate office, Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic lawmaker from Nebraska who now serves on the commission investigating the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was pondering his return to Capitol Hill. "Well," he said, "it's a chance to see some old friends."</p>
<P>
Except this time, the friends were sitting across the witness table, on the receiving end of Mr. Kerrey's very pointed questions about their roles in the war on terror.</p>

For Mr. Kerrey and the other members of the 9/11 commission, this week's televised hearings offered a turn in the spotlight, a chance to demonstrate to the nation their determination to understand whether the attacks could have been prevented. What the nation saw, however, was a collection of consummate government insiders, some  so familiar with the witnesses that they referred to them by their first names, even as they sharply questioned them. </p>
<P>
Nearly all the panel members — nine men and a woman, five Republicans and five Democrats — have at least one government title with the word "former" in it. There are two former governors, a former Navy secretary, a former deputy attorney general, two former House members, two former senators and a former White House counsel. They are so connected to one another, and to official Washington, that at times the questioning was as awkward as it was tough.</p>
<P>
Take John F. Lehman, who was  Navy secretary under President Ronald Reagan. He served alongside two of Wednesday's witnesses, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Richard A. Clarke, the former Bush administration counterterrorism adviser whose new book has created a furor in the White House.</p>
<P>
Mr. Lehman opened his questioning of Mr. Clarke with a reminder that, during the 28 years they have known one another, "I have genuinely been a fan of yours." He then began a blistering criticism of the book and the witness, to which Mr. Clarke replied wryly, "Thank you, John."</p>
<P>
Sometimes, the exchanges appeared as uncomfortable for the commissioners  as for the witnesses. Jamie S. Gorelick, a panel member, served as deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton. So when Mr. Lehman criticized the Clinton administration's Justice Department several commissioners shot worried looks toward Ms. Gorelick.</p>
<P>
She later said she did not mind.  "It would be more awkward for me," she said, "if the events when I was at the Justice Department were more an issue."</p>
<P>
Even so, she said, knowing so many of the witnesses made her more sympathetic to their plight, a point that was evident in her questioning of George J. Tenet, the director of  central intelligence. At one point, Ms. Gorelick referred to Mr. Tenet as George, saying playfully, "I've never seen you so easily intimidated."</p>
<P>
Such exchanges were a constant reminder not only of the commission's delicate task, but also the political climate in which the hearings unfolded, said Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University who is spending a semester in the Capitol and observed the proceedings.</p>
<P>
"These are senior statesmen, very much people who are at the heart of the establishment," Mr. Baker said.</p>
<P>
Describing the panel as "probing, but not aggressive," he said, "I think there's a very, very strong disposition to avoid finger pointing. It's very clear that they don't want to single out people for incompetence or not being vigilant enough."</p>
<P>
That has provoked criticism from some relatives of the victim.</p>
<P>
"They asked them easy questions, and they let them get off with baloney answers," Bruce DeCell, whose son-in-law, Mark Petrocelli, died in the attacks, said Tuesday, after listening to the panel question Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his predecessor, Madeleine K. Albright. He added, "I'm not impressed."</p>
<P>
Others have complained that, with the panel evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, the questions sometimes had a political taint. "We wanted journalists, we wanted academics," said Beverly Eckert, whose husband died in the World Trade Center and who prodded the Bush administration to create the panel. "We did not want politicians on the commission to avoid this kind of thing."</p>
<P>
But the panel members rejected the notion that politics played a role. James R. Thompson, the former Republican governor of Illinois, said the commission had "never taken a partisan vote." He added, "Every member of this commission — and some of them I've known for a long time — are able to rise above any friendships, any assignments they may have had, to reach honest conclusions here because they know the whole world is looking."</p>
<P>
As if to demonstrate the point, Mr. Thompson took pains to compliment members of the Clinton administration. Mr. Kerrey, meanwhile, was bipartisan in his criticism. He said later that the family members were never far from his mind, a point echoed by another commissioner, Timothy J. Roemer.</p>
<P>
Mr. Roemer, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana, said that when he was writing legislation to create the 9/11 commission a widow told him, "You're the kind of person we hope will kick the doors down, ask the tough questions." The woman, he said, then showed him her husband's wedding ring, saying it had been found, along with his finger, at ground zero.</p>
<P>
Asked if he thought about that as he questioned witnesses on Wednesday, he replied, "I've never stopped thinking about it." </p>
