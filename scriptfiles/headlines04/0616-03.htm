<p>NEW YORK   - Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has been retained by the distributors of "Fahrenheit 9/11" in an attempt to reverse the "R" rating slapped on the politically charged documentary last week.

<!--/endimage/-->Cuomo -- the veteran liberal Democrat who has been working in private practice since he was defeated a decade ago by Republican George Pataki -- said Tuesday morning at a Manhattan press conference that he already has begun talks with the Motion Picture Assn. of America's (MPAA) appeals board.

<p>Tom Ortenberg, the Los Angeles-based president of Lions Gate Films, also is negotiating with the MPAA and said talks are ongoing. Ortenberg's banner is releasing filmmaker Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit" with IFC Films, whose president, Jonathan Sehring, also was in attendance, and Harvey and Bob Weinstein's newly formed Fellowship Adventure Group.

<p>The MPAA has scheduled an appeals hearing for Tuesday in Los Angeles. The film's distributors are looking to resolve the matter even sooner because the film is set for a June 25 release, but that would require the MPAA to set an earlier date for the appeals hearing.

<p>The MPAA issued its rating because of "violent and disturbing images and for language."

<p>"Fahrenheit" marketing materials so far have used the wording "this film is not yet rated." If the appeal does not go "Fahrenheit's" way, the film's distribution troika could in theory roll it out as unrated because none of the parties are MPAA signatories. However, they see a PG-13 rating as an important strategy in aiming for the widest possible audience.

<p>"I am going to do everything I possibly can to get this picture advanced," Cuomo said Tuesday from the Midtown offices of law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. "That's why I'm in this thing ... because we are looking for (the most) possible viewers we can get and make this a seen movie. We want to get the best rating we can because that will enlarge the audience." He added he has watched the film three times.

<p>With its release just over a week away -- on "between 500-1,000 screens," according to Ortenberg -- the clock on "Fahrenheit's" rating issue is certainly ticking. If the MPAA does switch its decision, the film's print and TV ads would have to be changed on short notice.

<p>Ortenberg admitted it would be "impossible to quantify" any box office loss from the film's being stamped with an R rating, but he figured it could take away up to 20% of the film's revenue.

<p>He further said that the distributors would "honor (Moore's) artistic vision" but did not rule out snipping the film to gain the MPAA's PG-13 rating. "I couldn't even guess," he said of the editing possibility. "That's not my decision to make." At this juncture, it seems unlikely that significant cuts to the Palme d'Or winner would be made in time.

<p>Beyond the appeals process, Cuomo said he "is committed to doing everything (he) possibly can to make sure as many Americans as possible see this film" and will make the talk-show and other media rounds on behalf of the documentary.

<p>Cuomo added that he believes the film's subject matter is appropriate for younger viewers given the current state of the world. "War is too violent for kids," he said. "(This film) tells you about war. War is too violent for adults."

<p>Ortenberg cautioned, "A rating of PG-13 doesn't encourage 5-year-olds to see the movie," adding that the PG-13 rating would be aimed at bringing into theaters "particularly teens who may be asked or required to fight in this or the next war."

<p>While Cuomo has come aboard the "Fahrenheit" team in an official capacity, others not on the payroll have been lending their names as well.

<p>In New York on Monday at a special screening of "Fahrenheit" at the Ziegfeld Theater, Leonardo DiCaprio showed up to lend support and was cited by Harvey Weinstein for being an early proponent. DiCaprio also attended the film's Los Angeles A-list screening June 8.

<p>The Big Apple screening also drew Barry Levinson, Yoko Ono, Sean Lennon, Spike Lee, Bryant Gumbel, Eva Mendes, John Turturro, Ellen Burstyn, Amy Irving, Julie Taymor, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Tony Bennett and Richard Dreyfuss, among others.
