<p>President Bush has gone "under the radar" and around the Congress to 
spread his faith-based initiative throughout the federal government, according 
to <a href="http://www.religionandsocialpolicy.org/docs/policy/FB_Administrative_Presidency_Report_10_08_04.pdf" target="_new">a new study</a> released Monday.
<P>The study, compiled by researchers at the Rockefeller Institute of 
Government in Albany, N.Y., is one of the first comprehensive looks at the 
Bush administration's efforts to redirect government grants to churches and 
other faith-based groups.
<P>"Religious organizations are now involved in government-encouraged 
activities ranging from building strip malls for economic improvement to 
promoting child car seats,'' the study states.
<P><b>Branches in 10 agencies
</b>
<P>Taken together, the report finds that the Bush programs "mark a major 
shift in the constitutional separation of church and state."
<P>"Few if any presidents in recent history have reached as deeply into or 
as broadly across the government to implement a presidential initiative 
administratively,'' said institute director Richard Nathan.
<P>The study focuses on the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community 
Initiatives, which has set up faith-based branch offices in 10 federal 
agencies ranging from the Department of Health and Human Services to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. Bush administration officials say the  faith-
based initiative is meant to merely "level the playing field" so churches and 
other religious groups can compete for billions of dollars the federal 
government hands out each year through government social service contracts.
<P>Jim Towey, the director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and 
Community Initiatives, said Monday that he hadn't had time to read the entire 
study.
<P>"But parts of it that I have read seem to lay out dark motives for what 
is happening,'' Towey said in an interview with The Chronicle. "What it shows 
is that the president is taking the steps he promised he would take to end 
discrimination against faith-based groups.''
<P>Religious groups such as Catholic Charities USA and Lutheran Social 
Services have long gotten government funding to feed the poor, heal the sick 
and house the homeless. But they were required to set up separate nonprofit 
agencies to run those programs and to operate under strict rules that forbid 
them to proselytize or limit hiring to employees of a particular faith or 
religious denomination.
<P>So far, Congress has resisted Bush administration proposals to rewrite 
the rules and loosen long-standing restrictions against preaching in publicly 
funded poverty programs. 
<P>What the new study by the Rockefeller Institute's Roundtable on Religion 
and Social Welfare Policy shows is how the administration has pushed its 
agenda through presidential fiat.
<P><b>Study has 'point of view'
</b>
<P>Anne Farris, a co-author of the report, said President Bush had promoted 
his personal beliefs "both in ideology and deeds  --  in the workings of the 
federal government."
<P>Nathan, the institute director, said the study was based on "independent, 
nonpartisan research on faith-based social service."
<P>Towey questioned the institute's motives and said they had not 
interviewed him about the program he runs. "They have a point of view," he 
said.
<P>Most of the report relies on the government's own statistics and Bush 
administration statements about expanding church involvement in social welfare 
programs.
<P>For example, grants given to faith-based groups by the Departments of 
Health and Human Services increased 41 percent in fiscal year 2003.
<P>The report also cites newly revised Department of Labor rules that exempt 
religious organizations from provisions of the Civil Rights Act that forbid 
discrimination in employment based on religion.
<P>It also notes changes in federal regulations that now allow churches to 
use federal funds to renovate buildings that are used for both social services 
and religious worship.
<P>Joe Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for the Separation of Church 
and State, called the new study "very alarming."
<P>"This administration seems obsessed with faith-based solutions for 
everything,'' Conn said. "What they don't seem to worry about is the 
Constitution.''
<P><b>'Pray for rain'
</b>
<P>Even the Department of Agriculture now has its own office of faith-based 
initiatives, Conn noted.
<P>"Maybe they're going to pray for rain,'' he said.
<P>Towey said Conn and the Rockefeller Institute are overreacting to White 
House efforts.
<P>"President Bush does not want to proselytize or fund religion,'' he said. 
"We're talking about things like job training and substance abuse prevention, 
and opening up to small groups that have been shut by the ACLU and a radical 
fringe that wants an extreme separation of church and state.''</p>
