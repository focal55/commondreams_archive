WASHINGTON -- Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-Chackbay, will step down as chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee on Feb. 16 and will not seek re-election to a 13th term, his office announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P> In a letter hand-delivered to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, Tauzin said he wants to focus on his future beyond Congress. Several news reports say Tauzin has been offered the job of president of the <a href="http://www.phrma.org/" target="_new">Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturing Association</a>, the drug industry's lobbying arm. His staff said he hasn't decided whether to leave Congress before his term expires in January.

<!--/endimage/-->Tauzin's departure as Energy and Commerce Committee chairman could be the death knell for Louisiana's hopes of getting major federal aid to battle coastal erosion this year. Tauzin had inserted a section in a massive energy bill that would have provided $1 billion in 10 years for coastal restoration. The bill has passed the House but is stalled in the Senate and is not expected to move without substantial reductions in costs. The coastal dollars, already in doubt, are unlikely to survive without Tauzin on hand to press the state's case.
<p></P>
<P> Tauzin, 60, has said he "almost died" a few weeks ago from a bleeding ulcer and that the experience changed his outlook.
</P>
<P> In his letter to Hastert he said, "My recent time spent at the Bethesda Naval Hospital has reminded me of how precious time and life are and how dear my family and friends are," Tauzin wrote.
</P>

<P><b>Conflict of interest?
</b></P>
<P> Tauzin said he was stepping down so he could be "free to focus on whatever future awaits me and my family."
</P>
<P> Tauzin recently turned down an offer to head the Motion Picture Association of America, a post that reportedly pays $1 million per year. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America position is expected to pay even more.
</P>
<P> Tauzin aides wouldn't discuss his job options, but did say that he has recused himself from any health-care issues and has given that authority to the panel's vice chairman, Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C., a strong indication that he is considering the PhRMA job.
</P>
<P> Ever since the first reports 12 days ago that PhRMA was interested in Tauzin, the Louisiana congressman has been under a blizzard of criticism from some Democrats and consumer groups who raised questions of conflict of interest. Several House Democrats said they were considering filing a complaint with the House Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P> Common Cause called Tuesday for Tauzin to give up his chairmanship, saying that only by taking that step can he "avoid the perception or reality of conflicts of interest."
</P>
<P> His central role in negotiating a recently enacted Medicare prescription benefit favored by the drug industry was especially troubling, Common Cause said.
</P>
<P> "Even if your job negotiations with PhRMA began after your work on the Medicare bill was over, as you have reportedly said, it leaves one wondering whether you were trying to please PhRMA and what PhRMA may have promised you in return," Common Cause President Chellie Pingree said in a letter to Tauzin.
</P>

<P><b>'His decision alone'
</b></P>
<P> Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson denied that the pressure had any affect on Tauzin's decision. Johnson said that "no one in (GOP) leadership, not a single person, asked him to step down as chairman. It was his decision and his decision alone."
</P>
<P> Johnson said it was Tauzin's recent health scares that "led him to reassess where he is in life and what he wants to do next."
</P>
<P> In his letter to Hastert, Tauzin said he decided it is time to allow the Energy Committee "to begin its transition to new leadership."
</P>
<P> "Nearly 24 years of service on the Energy and Commerce Committee has taught me to deeply love and appreciate this -- the oldest and, I believe, greatest -- committee of the United States Congress," Tauzin wrote. "I believe my duty now is to turn over the gavel to its next generation of leaders who can focus exclusively on the committee's great future."
</P>
<P> Tauzin's departure along with the announced retirement early next year of the state's senior senator, Democrat John Breaux, will significantly reduce the clout of the state's delegation on Capitol Hill. Both men were instrumental in guiding projects and financing to Louisiana.
</P>
<P> Tauzin has been one of the most colorful members of Congress, always a first choice for reporters looking for a compelling quote on virtually any political topic.
</P>
<P> Tauzin was first elected to Congress in 1980 as a Democrat. He switched to the Republican Party in 1995 and was re-elected four more times as a member of the GOP. He said he has loved virtually every moment of his 24 years in the House, and 13 years as a legislator and legislative aide in the Louisiana Legislature.
</P>
<P> "Leaving will not be easy, but I believe that this year is the right time for me and my family," Tauzin told Hastert.
</P>
<P> Tauzin's replacement as chairman of the Energy Committee is likely to be Rep. Joseph Barton, R-Texas, now chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality. But other Republicans may compete for the powerful post.</P><p align="center">&copy;2004 NOLA.com.</p>
