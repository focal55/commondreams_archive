<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Trespassing charges against two people who 
wore anti-Bush T-shirts to the president’s July 4 
rally at the West Virginia Capitol were dropped Thursday 
because a city ordinance did not cover trespassing 
on Statehouse grounds.</p>
<p>Nicole 
and Jeff Rank of Corpus Christi, Texas, were removed 
from the event in restraints after taking off an outer 
layer of clothes to reveal homemade T-shirts that 
had President Bush’s name with a slash through it 
and the words &quot;Love America, Hate Bush&quot; 
on the back.</p>
<p>The 
Ranks were given summonses to appear in Charleston 
Municipal Court and released.</p>
<p>Charleston 
Municipal Judge Carole Bloom dismissed the charges 
on the motion of Assistant City Attorney Deloris Martin.</p>
<p>Nicole 
Rank, 30, who was doing environmental work for the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency in the wake of 
Memorial Day flooding in the state, was released from 
her position after her arrest without getting another 
assignment. She remains employed with FEMA.</p>
<p>Jeff 
Rank, 28, who is an unemployed oceanographer, was 
in West Virginia to be with her.</p>
<p>She 
said Thursday it is not uncommon to leave one FEMA 
job before being assigned another, although she had 
expected to work in West Virginia longer.</p>
<p>The 
couple said they were pleased with the case’s outcome 
and planned to return to Texas immediately.</p>
<p>Jeff 
Rank said the couple did not go the Capitol with the 
intention of being arrested. They are supporters of 
presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry, but wanted 
to take advantage of an opportunity to see Bush and 
&quot;give him a fair hearing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We 
certainly did not expect to be arrested for expressing 
our freedom of expression,&quot; Jeff Rank said.</p>
<p>He 
said they were not protesting in any other way than 
simply wearing the shirts and did not said anything.</p>
<p>Law 
enforcement officers told the couple to take the shirts 
off, cover them or get out. When they refused and 
sat down, they were arrested. They then stood and 
accompanied the police, said Charleston Mayor Danny 
Jones.</p>
<p>The 
Ranks said they have not protested at other political 
events and do not have any immediate plans to do so 
again.</p>
<p>&quot;We’ll 
continue to exercise our right to free expression 
when we see fit. We’re not professional protesters,&quot; 
Jeff Rank said. &quot;We’re going to get on with our 
lives and go back to Texas and get jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>Jones 
said, &quot;I don’t think this was just about a T-shirt 
issue. There were other things going on there. The 
officers, quite frankly, feared for the safety of 
the Ranks.&quot;</p>
<p>Jones 
said the city officers who filed the trespassing charges 
were acting under the direction of the Secret Service.</p>
<p>&quot;The 
officers are in a bind here,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>&quot;I 
think we need some guidance. Perhaps the Secret Service 
should have been called and let the Secret Service 
do with them what they want,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>&quot;The 
city of Charleston does not engage in violating people’s 
rights. We want everybody to come here,&quot; said 
Jones, a Republican.</p>
<p>Still, 
he said he would not apologize to the Ranks.</p>
<p>&quot;They 
were there to get arrested. They succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p>Jones 
said he would talk to police before Kerry’s appearance 
Thursday evening at the University of Charleston. 
The Massachusetts senator was scheduled to appear 
at a rally on a lawn across the Kanawha River from 
the Capitol.</p>
<p>The 
Ranks were accompanied to the hearing by an attorney 
affiliated with the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>Andrew 
Schneider, executive director of the ACLU’s West Virginia 
chapter, said the organization has been monitoring 
a pattern of similar cases in other states. The ACLU 
in September filed a federal lawsuit against the Secret 
Service, seeking an injunction against the Bush administration 
for segregating protesters at his public appearances.</p>
<p>The 
Secret Service agreed to stop the practice, ACLU attorney 
Witold Walczak told The Charleston Gazette.</p>
<p>Schneider 
said, &quot;This case demonstrates we will be out 
there watching and monitoring to make sure free speech 
rights are not violated regardless of political affiliation.&quot;</p>
