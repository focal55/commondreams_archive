BAGHDAD  - Shi'ite leaders warned on Tuesday that  Iraq's new constitution could cause problems in the long term,  with one senior cleric saying a clause on federalism had the  potential to provoke civil war.
<p> 
			
			The U.S. appointed Governing Council signed the  transitional law Monday after long negotiations and two  postponements, in a ceremony hailed by Washington as a  diplomatic victory and an important step toward a democratic  and sovereign government.<p>

But almost immediately after signing, several Shi'ite  leaders said they were still unhappy with the law -- especially  a clause they fear could give minority Kurds too much leverage  -- and would seek to introduce changes further down the line.<p> 
			
			The criticism continued Tuesday. One of Iraq's foremost  Shi'ite clerics, Ayatollah Mohammed Taqi al-Muddaresi, accused  the U.S.-led coalition of willfully including the clause which  majority Shi'ites see as a threat to their numeric dominance.<p> 
			
			"The clause in the transitional law relating to federalism  is tantamount to a time bomb which could cause a civil war in  Iraq," he said in a statement.<p> 
			
			Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, whose  objections to the constitution delayed its signing by three  days, refused to endorse the law Monday, saying it was an  obstacle to agreeing a permanent constitution next year.<p> 
			
			Shi'ite politicians said they would respect the document  they had signed, which they described as a major achievement,  but stressed they would find ways in the future to undo the  elements they were still unhappy with.<p> 
			
			"We see grave flaws in this law and more must be done to  deal with them in future," Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a council  member and head of the Supreme Council for the Islamic  Revolution in Iraq, a top Shi'ite party, said Tuesday.<p> 
			
			"The law is a major achievement, and we don't want the  political process to stop... We will work to deal with the  problems."<p> 
			
			The main clause Shi'ites object to is one they fear will  enable Kurds to veto a permanent constitution to be written  next year if it does not enshrine their demands for autonomy.<p> 
			
			A spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress said the party  welcomed the law, but that if Shi'ite concerns were not  resolved, the transition to democracy could reach a dead end.<p> 
			
			"We have to say that 12 members of the Governing Council  signed this law with reservations," Intifadh Qanbar told a news  conference.<p> 
			
			"(The problematic clauses) could clearly put Iraq into a  vicious circle and make the transitional period infinite, and  hamper efforts to draft a permanent constitution."<p> 
			
			COMPROMISE<p> 
			
			U.S. officials played down the dissent, saying the  important thing was that the 25 council members Washington  appointed had managed to reach a compromise.<p> 
			
			"While difficult work remains to establish democracy in  Iraq, today's signing is a critical step in that direction,"  President Bush said in a statement, and called the signing an  "historic milestone."<p> 
			
			While politics dominated the headlines, a series of attacks  across the country underlined the insecurity still prevailing  in Iraq, which for many Iraqis is of greater concern than the  return of power or the time scale for elections.<p> 
			
			A U.S. soldier was killed and another injured by a roadside  bomb near Baquba, a town 65 km (40 miles) north of Baghdad. The  death brought to 380 the number of U.S. soldiers killed in  action since the U.S. invaded Iraq.<p> 
			
			In the northern city of Mosul, insurgents threw a grenade  at government offices, injuring seven Iraqis in an attack  apparently aimed at U.S. soldiers inside the building, police  and witnesses said.<p> 
			
			Police in Mosul killed two attackers in a shootout in Mosul  Monday night. Four policemen were injured, and a third attacker  died later in hospital.<p> 
			
			Also Monday, three people were killed in Kirkuk, hit by  stray bullets as Kurds in the city celebrated the signing of a  constitution which enshrines their right to autonomy by  shooting into the air and chanting "Long live Kurdistan."<p> 
			
			Much remains to be done on the political side. No decision  has been taken on who will govern Iraq when the United States  hands over on June 30, effectively a caretaker government until  a national assembly is elected within seven months.<p> 
			
			Officials hope the United Nations will return to Iraq to  help facilitate those negotiations.<p>
