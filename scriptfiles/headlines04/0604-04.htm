BARCELONA, Spain (Reuters) - The United Nations  sounded the alarm over the health of the world's oceans on Friday, warning that aggressive fishing threatens little-understood corals that may hold the key to new medicines. 
<p>
 Oil exploration, waste dumping and telecommunications
cables pose further risks to mysterious cold water corals,
according to a report released ahead of World Environment Day
on Saturday which this year focuses on risks to marine life.
 <p>
 The corals, cousins of the creatures that build more famous
tropical reefs, live in sunless waters up to 3.5 miles deep but
are seriously threatened by deep sea fishing, the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP) said in its report.
 <p>
 Particularly damaging is bottom trawling, which involves
pulling huge weighted nets behind ships. The nets drag along
the sea floor scooping up all the marine life in their way --
from valuable fish to inedible species and delicate corals.
"Arguably the biggest threat to both cold and warm-water corals
is coming from unsustainable fishing," UNEP head Klaus Toepfer
said in a statement.
 <p>
 "We are only beginning to understand where (cold water
corals) are and what their role is...(they) may also harbor
important compounds and substances that could be the source of
new drugs," he added.
 <p>
 VORACIOUS APPETITE
 <p>
 Environmentalists trying to persuade governments to cut
back on fishing to protect reefs and precarious fish stocks are
up against a formidable enemy -- a voracious international
appetite for seafood.
 <p>
 From sushi in Tokyo to fish and chips on Britain's beaches,
consumer demand drives a massive market -- worth an estimated
&#36;75 billion a year -- and also supports jobs in coastal areas
of many countries where other employment options can be
limited.
 <p>
 Fishing of more usual commercial species is depleting
stocks at an alarming rate. According to the United Nations,
over 70 percent of the world's commercially important fish
stocks are over-exploited, depleted, fully fished or slowly
recovering.
 <p>
 But tumbling numbers of traditional favorites like cod only
encourage some fishermen to turn to more exotic deep sea
options like orange roughey or blue ling.
 <p>
 The fate of these fish is intimately tied to that of the
slow-growing cold-water corals they live in and around, and it
can be hard to catch them without damaging or destroying the
reefs.
 <p>
 Some of the delicate, lace-like structures date back up to
8,000 years, and are home to snails and clams until recently
thought to have become extinct two million years ago, the UNEP
report says.
 <p>
 OIL, WASTE DAMAGE
 <p>
 Even if deep sea fishing is scaled back, seabed
telecommunications cables, waste dumping and fossil fuel
prospecting would still threaten the fragile coral beds, which
scientists say are more extensive than they originally thought.
 <p>
 Found in seas from Norway to New Zealand, some of those in
the east Atlantic have already been destroyed, the report said.
 <p>
 And there is little hope of any short-term recovery, as the
reefs grow at one-tenth the rate of their tropical cousins.
 <p>
 World environment day aims to highlight their fate, and
that of other sea creatures with events from a port cleanup in
2004 Olympics host city Athens, to the launch of an
international environment photo competition in Tokyo and
Barcelona.
