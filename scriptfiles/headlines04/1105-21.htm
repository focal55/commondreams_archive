<p>BOULDER, Colorado - At least 85 students worried about war, a return of the draft and the future of the environment staged an overnight protest in the Boulder High School library before leaving peacefully Friday morning.

<p>The students said they wanted assurances from political leaders about the direction of the country. Rep. Mark Udall, D-Colo., met with some of the students for about an hour after they left the library at 7 a.m.

<p>''We're worried that in four years we're going to be at war with five countries and we're going to have no trees,'' senior Cameron Ely-Murdock said.

<p>''I know that's an extreme position, but I'm really worried about the draft,'' he said.

<p>President Bush and other administration officials have repeatedly said they have no plans to reinstate a draft, despite concerns about the number of troops needed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

<p>Principal Ron Cabrera agreed to let the students spend the night in the library if they would leave in time for Friday morning classes, which they did. A handful of teachers and parents stayed with them.

<p>''It's become a really large learning event about civics and having a political voice. And you can't beat that,'' Cabrera said.

<p>The sit-in began after school Thursday. The students, who brought sleeping bags and food, said they were not protesting Bush's re-election but were worried about the national debt, Iraq and other issues.

<p>''People are deciding stuff that's going to affect us, and we didn't have a say in it,'' said Maisie Salinger, 15, a freshman with a peace sign painted on her face.

<p>The students said they wanted to talk to representatives of GOP Gov. Bill Owens and U.S. Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, R-Colo. Musgrave sponsored the failed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.

<p>Spokesmen for Owens and Musgrave said neither received a request to speak to the students.

<p>''It's good to see that the concerned students are using their right to speak out,'' Musgrave spokesman Aaron Johnson said. ''That's what is protected by the Constitution.''

<p>Boulder County Republican Party vice chairman Bill Eckert met with some students.

<p>''They have every right to have their voices heard,'' he said. ''But their views are based on a lack of information and knowledge, and I think we owe it to them to help alleviate their fears.''
