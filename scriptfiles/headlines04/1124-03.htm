<p>A group of high-ranking congressional Democrats who had called for a 
federal probe of the November election announced Tuesday that the Government 
Accountability Office would investigate irregularities with voting machines 
and provisional ballots nationwide. 
<P>That announcement came on the same day that the Democratic Party in Ohio 
said it would join the recount effort in that state that was initiated by 
Green and Libertarian party candidates.
<P>Both of these developments reflect growing concern with election results 
and procedures that were first raised by poll watchers and individual voters 
and then circulated on the Internet.
<P>"All Americans, no matter how they voted, need to have confidence that 
when they cast their ballot, their voice is heard," Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, declared in a statement 
also signed by five other Democrats.
<P>In all, 13 Democratic members of Congress, including East Bay Reps. 
Barbara Lee and George Miller, have called for the GAO to investigate.
<P>Some 57,000 election day complaints were made to the House Judiciary 
Committee and will be handed over to the GAO, according to the statement 
released Tuesday, which said the agency would examine issues related to voting 
machines  --  including security, accuracy and fair distribution of machines 
at polling places  --  along with problems in counting provisional ballots.
<P>"We're not expecting to overturn any elections, but where there are 
problems, they should be fixed," said John Doty, press secretary for Jerrold 
Nadler, D-N.Y., one of the members who signed two letters to the GAO.
<P>The GAO made no official announcement of the investigation, but agency 
staff members told congressional staffers of the probe during a meeting 
earlier this week, Doty said.
<P>In Ohio, the state Democratic Party will recruit volunteers to help 
monitor the recount, along with volunteers organized by the other two parties.
<P>"We are proud to stand up for Democrats all over the world who have asked 
us to make sure every vote gets counted," said Dennis White, Ohio Democratic 
Party chair, in making Tuesday's announcement.
<P>Green Party candidate David Cobb has raised $250,000 on the Internet to 
pay filing fees for the recount and for the monitoring effort, said Blair 
Bobier, spokesman for Cobb.
<P>The Ohio secretary of state's office has said that a change in the winner 
is unlikely. Bush won the state by 136,000 votes, according to preliminary 
numbers.
<P>"We wouldn't think there would be that much of a difference in a recount,
" said Carl LoParo, spokesman for Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, noting 
that county boards of election were currently auditing  their results. "The 
boards are conducting what for all intents and purposes is a recount right now.
