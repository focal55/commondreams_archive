The verdict was near unanimous amid the tears and rage on
Palestinian streets after Israel killed Hamas leader Abdel-Aziz
al-Rantissi in an air strike Saturday that many Arabs felt
President Bush must have approved.
<p>
 "Bush has Rantissi's blood on his hands," said Khamis
Saadi, among tens of thousands who swept into Gaza's shabby
streets.
<p>
 "All doors to hell should be opened against the Israelis
and against the Americans," he cried.
<p>
 U.S. officials denied giving a green light to Israel.
<p>
 But Palestinians, fuming over unprecedented concessions
Bush gave Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon last week for a
Gaza pullout plan, felt Rantissi's killing was just another
action in the same vein.
<p>
 Sharon's Palestinian counterpart, Ahmed Qurie, called it "a
direct result of American encouragement and the complete bias
of the American administration toward the Israeli government."
<p>
 The United States has always been a target of Palestinian
and Arab ire because of its close relations with Israel.
<p>
 But Bush's statement that Israel could expect to keep
chunks of the West Bank seized in the 1967 Middle East war and
ruled out a return of refugees to what is now Israel was felt
by many Palestinians as a death blow for dreams of a real
state.
<p>
 "Bush freed the hands of Sharon to do whatever he liked
with the Palestinian people, to kill their leaders and to
confiscate their land," said one mourner in Gaza called Hammad.
<p>
 Israel said in Rantissi it had killed a "mastermind of
terrorism" -- Hamas Islamic militants have sworn to destroy
Israel and killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide attacks.
<p>
 CALLS TO KILL AMERICANS
<p>
 On the streets of Gaza, there were many calls for Hamas to
change its longstanding strategy of attacking only Israelis and
to start killing Americans too.
<p>
 A Hamas leader did not go that far, but allied the
Palestinian cause with that of insurgents fighting the U.S.
occupation of Iraq.
<p>
 "Sharon and Bush will see more blood coming from their
noses in Palestine and Iraq," said Mahmoud al-Zahar.
<p>
 The Hamas military wing, Izz al-Deen al-Qassam, vowed "100
retaliations," but all against Israel rather than the United
States.
<p>
 Condemnation of Rantissi's killing came from around the
world.
<p>
 Javier Solana, foreign policy chief for Middle East peace
Quartet member European Union, called the killing "unlawful"
and "not conducive to lowering tension." British Foreign
Secretary Jack Straw called it "unlawful, unjustified and
counter-productive."
<p>
U.S. reaction was more nuanced. "The United States is
gravely concerned for regional peace and stability," said a
statement, issued under the name of White House press secretary
Scott McClellan.
<p>
Anger in Arab countries was intense. The assassination came
less than one month after Israel killed Hamas spiritual leader
Ahmed Yassin in a similar attack. That drew thousands to
protests across the Middle East.
<p>
Egypt's Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher accused Israel of
trying to "kill off the chance for peace (and push) the region
to the edge of the abyss."
<p>
Some in a region that is extremely uncomfortable with the
U.S. occupation of Iraq also saw an American hand.
<p>
Yemeni Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qibri said: "The United
States bears the responsibility for what happens, since after
every visit by Sharon to Washington he commits more terrorism
and assassinations."
