<p> President Fidel Castro warned his colleague George W. Bush not to make war on Cuba and offered health care to 3,000 Americans who cannot afford it.</p>
<p>"You would not win that war," he told an absent Bush while addressing a crowd of 200,000. "You will not find glory in military action against Cuba," because "your march on Cuba would not be easy."</p>
<p>Castro's offer of free medical care in his 35-minute speech was extended to the same number of Americans as those who died on September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>"Those 3,000 Americans could travel to our country, accompanied by a family member, and receive treatment absolutely free," said Castro, who likes to remind Cubans they enjoy universal, free health care while 40 million Americans do without.</p>
<p>Castro wore his olive-green military uniform as he spoke before a 12-meter (40-foot) likeness of Bush, also in a military uniform and daubed with a Hitler-style mustache.</p>
<p>Below the photo, hung near the US Interests Section in Havana, was the text: "Bush, Fascist: There Is No Aggression Cuba Cannot Resist."</p>
<p>Castro also took potshots at Cuban emigres in Miami, which he called "a known, terrorist Mafia." He said Bush should not count on their support in the November 2 election.</p>
<p>"Your dependence on those groups will lose you many votes, not only in Florida but in the entire country," Castro said, in what he called an open letter to Bush.</p>
<p>Castro also took a swipe at Bush's recently announced plans to tighten US residents' remittances to relatives in Cuba, as well as to crack down on US citizens who visit Cuba. Bush's stated purpose is to accelerate the fall of the 77-year-old dictator.</p>
<p>Castro said that with or without him, Cuba's socialist revolution would go on.</p>
<p>"There would not be the slightest damage to our capacity to struggle and resist," he said.</p>
<p>"The orders of what is to be done have already been given. I will be the first in line to die for my country."</p>
