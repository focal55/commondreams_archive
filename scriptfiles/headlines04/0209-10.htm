<p>NEW YORK - Labor rights groups on Monday accused
the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., of
turning a blind eye to abusive conditions at a factory in China
that makes plastic toys for the company.
<p>
 The <a href="http://www.nlcnet.org/" target="_new">National Labor Committee</a> and <a href="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/" target="_new">China Labor Watch</a> said in
a report that workers at the factory in Chang Ping Township in
Guangdong province were paid less than the legal minimum and
worked longer hours than legally allowed.
<p>
 A Wal-Mart spokesman said he was not aware of the specific
allegations but that the company worked to ensure factories all
over the world were run legally and inspected for abuses.
<p>
 The report said the Chinese factory management trained
workers to answer prepared questions and paid them a bonus for
remembering them correctly during visits by Wal-Mart
inspectors.
<p>
 It said emergency fire exits and medical boxes were
normally locked, but the Chinese managers unlocked them ahead
of inspections. They also doctored time cards, the report said.
<p>
 The rights groups said Wal-Mart appeared to condone the
Chinese management's methods. "No company could be that shallow
or gullible, unless it were consciously acting out a role with
the full intent of achieving the desired result -- a
whitewash," the report said.
<p>
 Bill Wertz, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based
company, said Wal-Mart had experienced inspectors who adhered
to its corporate standards.
<p>
 "It would be a complete violation of our policy for anyone
to participate in any charade that would merely make a pretense
of observing a thorough inspection," Wertz said.
<p>
 The rights groups said workers received an average 16.5
cents an hour when the legal minimum in China was 31 cents an
hour. The workweek was seven days when five days was legal and
people toiled for up to 20-1/2 hours per shift.
<p>
 The groups said the same He Yi Electronics and Plastics
Products Factory produced "bobblehead" sports star dolls for
America's major professional sports organizations through U.S.
company Fotoball.
<p>
 Charles Kernaghan, head of the National Labor Committee,
said the sports organizations -- including the National
Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National
Collegiate Athletic Association -- had not responded to his
letters.
<p>
 "We're hitting a stone wall with these people, which is
sort of amazing, given their profits and the salaries ... the
players won't be happy that their images are being made by
workers in China with zero rights," said Kernaghan, who
revealed in October that a sweatshop in Honduras made the
clothing line of hip-hop music and fashion entrepreneur Sean
Combs.
<p>
 Kernaghan said on Monday that Combs' staff had worked with
his group to greatly improve conditions in that factory.
