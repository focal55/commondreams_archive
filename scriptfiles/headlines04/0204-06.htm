<p>RIVERDALE, Md. - A panel of international experts
said on Wednesday there was a "high probability" of more cases
of mad cow disease in American cattle, and recommended the U.S.
government ban cattle brains and spinal material in all
livestock feed and pet food as a safeguard.

<p>
 The panel was appointed by Agriculture Secretary Ann
Veneman after the United States' first case of the
brain-wasting disease was reported in a Holstein dairy cow in
Washington state on Dec. 23. Discovery of the disease halted
some &#36;3.8 billion in annual American beef exports.
<p>
 The disease is believed to be spread through livestock feed
contaminated with the brain, spinal cord or nervous system
tissue of infected animals, which scientists call specified
risk material or SRM.
<p>
 The experts noted there was a "high probability" that other
infected cattle have been imported from Canada, and possibly
Europe. Their report gave no details.
<p>
 The infected U.S. cow was imported from Alberta, Canada in
2001. Canada reported its own first domestic case of mad cow
disease last May.
<p>
 Panel chairman Urlich Kihm, who addressed a special meeting
of U.S. Agriculture Department officials, said the United
States "could have a case a month" of mad cow disease. Kihm
said he based that estimate on his own "logical thinking" and
the experience of nations such as Denmark and Italy.
<p>
 However, he said the United States would not see the kind
of broad outbreak seen in Britain in the late 1980s. About 140
people, most in Britain, have died of the human form of the
illness.
<p>
 The panel recommended several additional precautions the
U.S. government should take.
<p>
 "All SRM must be excluded from all animal feed, including
pet food," Kihm said.
<p>
The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates livestock
feed, should eliminate all animal protein from cattle feed as
another safeguard, the panel said. "The prohibition of the use
of all meat and bone meal (MBM), including avian, in ruminant
feed is justified partly due to the issues of
cross-contamination as well as the current problems in
differentiating mammalian and avian MBM," it said.
 <p>
 That means sheep and goats -- as well as cattle -- would
not be allowed to eat feed containing MBM.
 <p>
 Kihm was scheduled to give the recommendations to Veneman
later on Wednesday.
 <p>
 "We look forward to thoroughly reviewing the report as well
as any further recommendations from the Foreign Animal Disease
Advisory Committee," a USDA spokeswoman said.
 <p>
 One of the panel's goals was "removal of all SRM from both
human food and animal feed," according to documents released at
the USDA meeting. The USDA should consider banning brain and
spinal cord from all cattle over 12 months of age from human
food, it said.
 <p>
 Another necessary step is for the United States to test all
"at risk" cattle over 30 months of age, the experts said.
 <p>
 Those would include animals that die on the farm or while
being transported to slaughter plants, sickly or crippled
"downer" animals, and cattle sent to "emergency slaughter," the
panel said. The government last month banned the use of downer
cattle from the human food supply.
<p>
 USDA officials said they will finish their investigation of
herdmates of the infected cow within the next two weeks, a plan
that the panel said it supported.
<p>
Other panel members include William Hueston, director of
the Center for Animal Health and Food Safety at the University
of Minnesota; Dagmar Heim, chief of BSE control programs in the
Swiss Federal Veterinary Office; and Stuart MacDiarmid, a New
Zealand mad cow expert.
