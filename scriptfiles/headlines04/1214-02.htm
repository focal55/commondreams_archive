cases.

In an open letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld,
Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news2004/1213-15.htm">revealed two new cases</a> of deaths in custody
and demanded an investigation into a third that took place
three months ago.
<p>"It's time for the United States to come clean about crimes
committed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan," Brad Adams, Asia
Division director for Human Rights Watch, said on Monday.
<p>Chris Grey, spokesman for the U.S. Army's Criminal
Investigation Command in Washington, later told Reuters of
another two prisoners who had died in U.S. detention, bringing
the total number to eight.
<p>The two new cases mentioned by the HRW in its letter to
Rumsfeld involved the death of an Afghan army soldier
mistakenly arrested with seven others in March last year, and
the suspected murder of another detainee in 2002, HRW said.
<p>The soldier, Jamal Naseer, died at the U.S. base at Gardez,
southeast of Kabul in March, 2003. The army opened an
investigation into the case in May, 2004, the rights group
said.
<p>Men detained with Naseer have said U.S. forces punched
them, kicked them, hung them upside down, and hit them with
sticks or cables. Some said they were soaked in cold water and
forced to lie in snow, and given electric shocks to their toes,
HRW said in its letter.
<p>The rights group also said there was another previously
unpublicised suspected murder of an Afghan detainee by four
U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan in or before September 2002.
<p>Defense Department documents released to the American Civil
Liberties Union  in the past week show the Army opened an
investigation in September, 2002. HRW says the document states
that a captain and three sergeants murdered the Afghan, but it
does not know if anyone was prosecuted.
<p>The Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman
identified the dead man as M. Sayari and said he died on August
28, 2002. The investigation had closed, and the case was
adjudicated by the Army, the spokesman said without giving
further details.
<p>The most recent reported death in custody was that of Sher
Mohammad Khan, who died, HRW said, after being arrested during
a raid at the village of Lakan in southeast province of Khost
on Sept. 24.
<p>The U.S. military said Khan died of a heart attack. Khan's
brother was shot dead in the same raid. The military said he
was killed in self defense.
<p>The rights group had earlier taken the U.S. military to
task over deaths of three other detainees, including two at
Bagram airbase in December, 2002, that were ruled as homicides
by U.S. military pathologists.
<p>The Army Criminal Investigation Command announced in
October that it had recommended 28 people for prosecution in
connection with the deaths at Bagram.
