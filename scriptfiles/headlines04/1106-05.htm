<p>DALLAS - Texas education officials on Friday
approved health textbooks for high school students that extol
the virtues of sexual abstinence but only make passing mention
of contraceptives, which critics say violates state regulations
and endangers the health of teens.

  <p>
 The battle in Texas has national implications because the
state is the second-biggest market for textbooks in the United
States. Books approved by the state's school board are
typically marketed nationally.
 <p>
 The 15-member Texas Board of Education approved four books,
all of which promote a birth control program based on
abstinence. Three make no mention of contraceptives, while one
makes passing references to condoms.
 <p>
 State regulations require information on contraceptives to
be included in the sexual education curriculum, but board
members said the books meet state standards because
contraceptives are mentioned in separate supplements or in the
teacher's edition.
 <p>
 Critics said the board bowed to social conservatives and
their approval will leave Texas teens with inadequate
information about their health.
 <p>
 "Instead of doing the responsible thing and providing high
school students with life-saving information about sex and
health, the Board of Education has left them to fend for
themselves and get information from each other and sources like
the Internet and MTV," said Samantha Smoot, president of the
Texas Freedom Network, which battles social conservatives.
 <p>
 The texts are likely to appear in classrooms in August 2005
-- where they could be the standard text for about 10 years.
The publishers of the books are Holt, Rinehart and Winston,
Glencoe/McGraw Hill and Thomson Delmar Learning, which is owned
by the Thomson Corp . Holt is owned by Reed Elsevier PLC and
Reed Elsevier NV .
 <p>

 Many current textbooks in Texas have more information on
contraceptives than the ones the board approved.
 <p>
 Surveys indicate a wide majority of U.S. parents support a
strong abstinence message to teens in sex education.
 <p>
 According to Centers for Disease Control figures, Texas has
been among the top five states in the country for teenage
pregnancies for several years.
 <p>
 When he was governor of Texas, George W. Bush pushed for an
abstinence-based sexual education curriculum.
 <p>
 The board also asked on Friday for a change in the
definition of marriage for separate middle school health books
after a conservative member of the board said new language was
needed to replace code words she thought promoted a homosexual
agenda.
 <p>
 Board member Terri Leo, a Republican, said terms such as
"couples" and "adults" should be replaced with terms such as:
husband, wife, mother and father. She wanted to make sure the
textbooks did not advocate same-sex marriage.
 <p>
 The board approve language saying: "Marriage is a life-long
union between a husband and wife."
 <p>

 The board rejected a proposal from Leo asking for language
saying: "homosexuals, lesbians and bisexuals as a group are
more prone to self-destructive behavior like depression,
illegal drug use and suicide."
