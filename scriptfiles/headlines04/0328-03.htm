<p>BAGHDAD  - Iraq's U.S.-led administration Sunday shut down a newspaper that is a mouthpiece for Shi'ite cleric Moqtada Sadr, accusing it of publishing articles that incite violence against American troops.

Ali Yasseri, editor of the weekly al-Hawza newspaper, said dozens of U.S. troops padlocked the newspaper's offices after ordering staff to leave. 
<p>"They told us they would arrest us if we did not leave. They said our articles incite people against America," Yasseri told Reuters outside the newspaper offices. 
<p>U.S. soldiers handed him a letter from U.S. civil administrator Paul Bremer, citing a breach of an order issued last year that bans incitement to violence. 
<p>"These false articles not only mislead readers but constitute a real threat of violence against coalition forces and Iraqi citizens who cooperate with the coalition in the reconstruction of Iraq," a letter signed by Bremer said. 
<p>The letter referred to a series of articles it said had incited hatred, including an editorial entitled "Bremer follows the steps of Saddam." 
<p>"This is a violation of our rights," Yasseri said. 
<p>Hundreds of Shi'ites later gathered in Baghdad to protest against the ban on the newspaper. 
<p>Last July, the U.S.-led administration closed down another newspaper for inciting violence. The Arabic-language satellite television news channels Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya have also faced sanctions from the administration and the Iraqi Governing Council for allegedly violating the law. 
<p>Sadr, a young and radical Shi'ite cleric, has often spoken out against the U.S. occupation, in contrast to many other Shi'ite groups that have sought to work with occupying forces.
