<p>WASHINGTON  - 

Four British ex-inmates of the U.S.
detention center at Guantanamo Bay sued Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld and others on Wednesday saying they were
tortured in violation of U.S. and international law.
<p>
 The four former detainees are seeking &#36;10 million in
damages but primarily want Rumsfeld and other defendants to be
held accountable for their actions, said Eric Lewis, the lead
lawyer in the case.
<p>
 "This is a case about preserving an American ideal -- the
rule of law," Lewis said at a news conference. "It is
un-American to torture people. It is un-American to hold people
indefinitely without access to counsel, courts or family. It is
un-American to flout international treaty obligations."
<p>
The plaintiffs are Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel
Ahmed, all of Tipton, England and Jamal al-Harith of
Manchester. Al-Harith was picked up in Pakistan and the other
three in Afghanistan  after the 2001 U.S. Afghanistan invasion.
 <p>

 The federal court suit alleges they faced repeated
beatings, death threats, interrogation at gunpoint, forced
nakedness and menacing with unmuzzled dogs, among other
mistreatment, during more than two years at Guantanamo Bay.
 <p>
 The Pentagon  had no immediate comment on the suit.
 <p>
 The Bush administration has had several legal setbacks in
its policy of detaining suspects, including at the Guantanamo
Bay Naval Base on Cuba, without charges and without legal
representation.
 <p>
 The latest suit charges the Defense Department chain of
command authorized this treatment, in violation of the U.S.
Constitution, the Geneva Conventions and other laws.
 <p>
 All four were released without in March 2004 and returned
to England.
 <p>
 Besides Rumsfeld, the suit also names Gen. Richard Myers,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff; Maj. Gen. Geoffrey
Miller, former commander at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base; Gen.
James Hill, commander at U.S. Southern Command, as well as
other named officials and up to 100 "John Does" who allegedly
were "involved in the illegal torture of plaintiffs" at
Guantanamo.
