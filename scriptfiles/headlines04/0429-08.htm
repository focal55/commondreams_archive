As the presidential campaign turned into a brawl this week over John Kerry's stint in Vietnam and what he did or did not do with his medals, some Democrats were actually pretty pleased. They figured that any opportunity to compare Mr. Kerry's military background with President Bush's — not to mention Vice President Dick Cheney's — was welcome and they took advantage of it.

But perhaps none of them could rival Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey and a World War II veteran, who appeared on the Senate floor on Wednesday with a poster featuring an illustration of a chicken in a medal-bedecked military uniform.
<p> 
In a take-no-prisoners display, the lawmaker lashed out at Republicans critical of Mr. Kerry, calling them chickenhawks. He decried Mr. Cheney, who received deferments from service during the Vietnam era, as the leader of the flock for his criticism earlier in the week that Mr. Kerry was not capable of protecting the nation's security.
<p> 
"Chickenhawks: they shriek like a hawk but they have the backbone of a chicken," Mr. Lautenberg said. "We know who the chickenhawks are. They talk tough on national defense and military issues and cast aspersions on others. When it was their turn to serve, where were they? A-W-O-L, that's where. A-W-O-L."
<p> 
Mr. Lautenberg's tough criticism draw a plea from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a prisoner-of-war in Vietnam, for all sides to move past the fight over Mr. Kerry's record as well as Mr. Bush's time in the National Guard. He said such exchanges could actually be damaging to military morale.
<p> 
"It is time to declare a truce," Mr. McCain said. "At least could we declare that the Vietnam War is over and have a cease-fire?"
<p> 
Mr. McCain did acknowledge, however, that the picture of the military chicken was "kind of clever. I've got to give it to, hand it to, whoever the artist is."
