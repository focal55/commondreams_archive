<p>It's no accident that Florida is where rock star Bruce Springsteen will end his headline-grabbing "vote for change" tour in October. Or that President Bush and Democratic contender John Kerry have visited the sunshine state about 50 times already this year, and there are still 12 weeks of campaigning left. Or that anti-Bush film-maker Michael Moore is promising to take his camera to Florida hotspots on election day on November 2. 
<p>Few Americans can forget that four years ago the president won Florida by 527 votes. 
<p>That was after a bitterly contested 37 days of recounts and lawsuits. In African- American and other poor Democratic-leaning precincts many voters had been turned away from polling stations. 
<p>Florida, center of the most egregious mishaps in 2000, is too close to call. If Ohio is the foremost battleground for campaigning, Florida is the election's swamp of controversy and fraud. Florida is also the largest swing state, any of which could tip the final result. More money is being spent on registering voters here than in any other while billions in public money has been spent to clean up the system. 
<p>Yet the upcoming vote could be 2000 redux. "Florida's election system was a national disgrace, and it is well on its way to becoming one again," warned the New York Times. 
<p>Most of Florida's electorate will vote electronically, an attempt to avoid "hanging chads" - tiny pieces of paper - that so famously jammed punchcard machines in 2000. But the electronic systems do not produce paper records. 
<p>Florida's governor Jeb Bush, the president's brother, is accused of refusing numerous requests for a paper trail. The Republican-led state legislature has also exempted the machines from recount rules that are required for other voting methods. 
<p>In March, during the Democratic primary, precincts with touch-screen rather than optical machines registered eight to nine times as many blank ballots. "There is no reasonable reason for the discrepancy," said Ion Sanchoone, an election supervisor. 
<p>Secretary of State Glenda Hood countered that those using touch-screen machines must have intended to cast no vote. She said critics were trying to destroy Florida's credibility. 
<p>But in the state's first major test of touch-screen voting, in Miami in 2002, almost all of the records disappeared in two computer crashes a few months later. The loss only emerged in July after a citizens' group demanded an audit. 
<p>The results, for the Democratic governor's primary, were eventually found on stray CDs. Also, on the day of the election, computers had failed to start properly and clerks seemed confused by the technology. 
<p>Janet Reno, President Clinton's former Attorney General, lost by a slim 4,794 votes. "This is disturbing news and casts doubt on Florida's ability to run a fair election this fall," said the New York Times. 
<p>On Friday, a state appeals court dismissed a lawsuit that sought a paper trail, ruling that voters are not guaranteed "a perfect voting system". 
<p>Florida is having problems, too, with its list of registered voters. Officials secretly purged tens of thousands of felons earlier this year - 2500 of them erroneously. 
<p>The state is one of only a handful that prohibits criminals from voting for life even after they have served their sentence, unless they are granted clemency. 
<p>According to the Miami Herald, the purging was systematically biased against African-Americans. The majority were Democrats. 
<p>But that was not the case with Hispanics because of a difference between two lists of data. In Florida, Hispanic voters tend to support Republicans, note critics scathingly. 
<p>The private company that conducted the purge, Accenture, is Bermuda-based and recently secured a 'homeland security' contract worth up to $10 billion. It says it repeatedly warned the state about the bias but was ignored. 
<p>Wednesday's Palm Beach Post noted that Accenture's state lobbyists include a former aide to Jeb Bush and a former state Republican chairman. 
<p>Accenture has also given $300,000 in campaign contributions, favoring Republicans two-to-one, says the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. 
<p>Betty Reed, of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, says she meets too many young blacks who tell her that their vote will never be counted, so they will not register. 
<p> Batteries of lawyers and observers are being lined up for November 2. Democrats have assembled a team including a former Florida attorney general, and a former federal prosecutor. Janet Reno said she might help.
<p>The issue was a rallying point during the Democratic convention. When Michael Moore told the Florida delegation that he would be in Florida on November 2, the crowd rushed the stage. 
<p>"We're going to put up a huge spotlight and they will not get away with it this time," he shouted. Some delegates wore badges saying "527", the margin by which Al Gore lost Florida in 2000. Others had "Re-defeat Bush!" buttons. 
<p>Rev Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, has announced that he will tour the state by bus to help register voters. Jackson suggests that yellow crime-scene tape should be strung along Florida's borders, so likely is the fraud. 
<p>"People are honestly pissed off," Florida Congressman Ed Jennings, an African- American, told the Miami Herald. "It's like, four years later and here we go again." 
<p><b>'Nam was dirty - but politics is dirtier</b>
<p>With 86 days until the election, it's dirt, lies and videotapes. A TV advert and upcoming book by a group of war veterans slams Kerry as a liar who exaggerated his Vietnam bravery. According to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Kerry shot a Vietcong teenager in the back while the victim was fleeing. The ad, paid for by a pro-Bush building contractor in Texas, also claims Kerry lied about an incident in 1969 that earned him a Bronze Star. 
<p>"I know, I was there," fumes 2nd class gunner's mate Van O'Dell in the advert. Kerry commandeered a Navy swift boat in the Mekong Delta for four months. "Kerry has not been honest about what happened in Vietnam," adds George Elliott, Kerry's former commanding officer. 
<p>Kerry often appears with his "Band of Brothers," political supporters who served with him in Vietnam. The senator opened his convention speech with a boyish smile, a salute and the embarrassingly mawkish, "I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty!" 
<p>But there's a problem. None of the 250 veterans in the advert served in Kerry's boat. All surviving members of Kerry's crew back him. 
<p>According to the Boston Globe, Kerry's home town paper, one of the anti-Kerry vets in an interview withdrew a key accusation - that Kerry did not deserve a Silver Star. 
<p>But Elliott now insists Kerry was undeserving and that the Globe misquoted him. The conservative online Drudge Report claims the reporter in question, Mike Kranish, is signed up to write the forward to an official pot-boiler on the Kerry campaign. 
<p>The anti-Kerry book, Unfit For Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry, is top of amazon.com's best-seller list based on advance publicity on Drudge. It will be published on August 15. 
<p>A confused Bush meanwhile provided fodder for his enemies, saying: "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." <p align="center">&copy; newsquest (sunday herald) limited 2004</p>
