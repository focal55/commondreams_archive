<p>CARACAS, Venezuela - Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez accused the United States on Sunday of plotting his
overthrow through a coup or assassination should his opponents
fail to secure a referendum vote against him this year.
<p>
 Speaking on the eve of a regional summit in Mexico, the
left-wing leader, for the second day running, delivered a
furious tirade against senior U.S officials who have criticized
his five-year presidency.
<p>
 Venezuela is a major supplier of oil to the United States.
<p>
 The Venezuelan president said recent statements by U.S.
officials urging him to submit to a constitutional referendum
were "preparing the ground" for his possible violent ouster,
either through a military coup or an assassin's bullet.
<p>
 He repeated his conviction that Venezuela's opposition had
failed to gather enough pro-vote signatures to trigger a
referendum in April or May. Electoral authorities are due to
start checking the signatures next week to see if they fulfill
the 2.4 million required.
<p>
 "If in the end they don't have enough signatures, and the
National Electoral Council declares this, then I can see them
there in Washington saying I'm an enemy of democracy," Chavez
said during his "Hello President" television and radio show.
<p>
 "(They'll say) that Chavez sabotaged the referendum, and so
we have to get rid of him, it's worth toppling him ... that the
armed forces should take up arms against me, or that someone
should shoot me," he added.
<p>
 The opposition says it collected over 3 million signatures
and has accused the president of trying to block the poll.
<p>
Chavez, who has clashed with Washington in the past,
accused critics like Bush's National Security Adviser

Condoleezza Rice of having publicly supported a 2002 coup that
briefly overthrew him. Washington denies this.
 <p>
 The Venezuelan leader promised to make his voice heard at
Monday's Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico, which
will be attended by President Bushand other regional leaders.
 <p>
 STORMY SUMMIT?
 <p>
 His weekend outbursts could herald a stormy meeting. The
left-leaning governments of Argentina and Brazil also differ
with Washington on foreign policy and free trade.
 <p>
 On Saturday, rebuffing condemnation from Rice of his
friendship with Cuba's Communist President Fidel Castro, Chavez
told the U.S. government to stop "sticking its nose" in
Venezuela's affairs.
 <p>
 He attacked Rice again Sunday. "Am I not right to call her
a meddling illiterate?" Chavez asked.
 <p>
 He again rejected U.S. accusations that he and Castro were
working together to overthrow Latin American governments
through popular revolts, like the one in Bolivia in October
that toppled pro-U.S. President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.
 <p>
 "What's the cause of the fall of Sanchez de Lozada in
Bolivia? Is it Chavez? Is it Fidel (Castro)? No ... the cause
comes from Washington, which designed the new international
economic order," Chavez said. He, like Castro, argues that U.S.
free-market capitalism causes poverty and inequality.
 <p>
 Chavez, a former paratrooper whose foes accuse of trying to
implant Cuba-style communism, compared himself with the U.S.
civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..
<p>
 "We have ... the same dream of freedom and equality," said
Chavez, whose audience included a group of African-American
social activists, among them actor Danny Glover.
<p>
In a homily Sunday, Venezuela's Roman Catholic Cardinal,
Rosalio Castillo Lara, condemned Chavez's self-styled
"revolution" as an "anachronistic and absurd political
project."</p>
