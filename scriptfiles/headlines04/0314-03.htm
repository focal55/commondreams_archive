<p>Tom Andrews on Saturday will be marking the anniversary of America's attack on Iraq, but he won't be celebrating.</P>

<P>

 The former two-term congressman from Maine is national director of a coalition of 42 advocacy groups called <a href="http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/" target="_new">Win Without War</a>. He led protests a year ago to avoid the conflict, at one point coordinating a barrage of calls from people nationwide that jammed the Senate phone system.</P>

<P>

 Now he's coordinating activities aimed at reviewing what he describes as President Bush's misleading arguments for the war, raising hackles all the way to the White House. His goal is to avoid such a bellicose strategy in the future and return to building international consensus.</P>

<P>

 "We'll be putting things in perspective one year later," Andrews said. "That's one of the things we've got on the stove and we're heating up."</P>

<P>

 Andrews is no stranger to protest. He was executive director of the Maine Association of Handicapped Persons during the 1980s, when the group opposed federal policies relating to education and the disabled.</P>

<P>

 His current activities focus on Iraq. Tactics include a breakfast Friday to unveil a new television ad and a newspaper ad that will hypothesize about what would have happened if the public knew then what it now knows about Iraq.</P>

<P>

 On another front, a group in his coalition, the National Council of Churches, will hold candlelight vigils next weekend to mark the anniversary.</P>

<P>

 In April, Andrews will be launching a series of events in cities across the country featuring former defense and intelligence officials talking about foreign policy.</P>

<P>

 "We've been making the rounds," he said of his appearances on CNN, Fox, ABC, numerous radio stations and in newspaper interviews. "We're trying to get this perspective out there."</P>

<P>

 The thrust of Andrews' argument is that Bush and his administration manipulated information about Iraq to deceive the country about the threat Iraq posed.</P>

<P>


 OF COURSE, BUSH is unapologetic about toppling Saddam Hussein from power, describing the tyrant as an evil threat to his own country and his neighbors. Bush is campaigning as the steadiest hand to lead the country through a worldwide war on terrorism.</P>

<P>

 But Win Without War and one of its most prolific members, Moveon.org, recently began an advertising campaign urging Congress to censure Bush. Newspaper ads cite Bush's claims about weapons of mass destruction, unmanned weapons and nuclear threats that are contradicted in documents such as a CIA report, the National Intelligence Estimate, and newspaper articles.</P>

<P>

 "The president made claims he knew - or should have known - were false," said one ad in The Washington Post.</P>

<P>

 Andrews characterized the ads as holding Bush accountable as chief executive of the country, similar to corporate executives under fire for mismanaging their businesses. One of Andrews' news conferences in January highlighted that 500 American soldiers had been killed in Iraq with no end in sight.</P>

<P>

 "This is what you get under the Bush doctrine, which of course is a complete rejection of 50 years of bipartisan consensus on international policy - a consensus that called for a containment of threats through international cooperation," Andrews said. "We feel that this is extremely dangerous."</P>

<P>

 The Republican National Committee sent letters earlier this month to 250 television stations across the country urging them against running the Moveon.org ads, which party officials argued violated federal campaign law.</P>

<P>

 "A month ago I noted that Democrats seemed intent on running one of the dirtiest campaigns in modern presidential politics, and I cited a litany of early examples of disturbing tactics," said Ed Gillespie, the party chairman. "It appears we can now add to the list a willingness to blatantly violate the new campaign finance laws."</P>

<P>

 Andrews denied the ads violate the law. He argued that the groups are engaging in political debate that has been protected and encouraged since the founding of the country.</P>

<P>

 "I think it's a healthy public debate about national security that's in the public interest and in the interest of our country," he said. "Of course, there are many who disagree with our point of view. That's fine. Let's engage in debate. But let's not hide behind a law and squelch public debate when in fact the law permits this public debate to occur."</P>

<P>

 THE DISPUTE ABOUT the broadcast ads focuses on whether they violate a federal campaign-reform law that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld last year to ban large, unregulated contributions to national parties from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals.</P>

<P>

 The argument against the ads is that they are funded by groups organized under section 527 of the federal tax code, rather than as political organizations. The strategy, which has been employed by groups aligned with both parties, allows the groups to continue raising large amounts of money to influence political debate.</P>

<P>

 For example, financier George Soros gave $1.4 million to Moveon.org last year as part of $4.8 million the group raised, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog agency.</P>

<P>

 Another Moveon.org ad was too hot for CBS to air during the Super Bowl. The spot featured children doing jobs - washing dishes in a restaurant, cleaning an office building and standing in an assembly line - with the tag line, "Guess who's going to pay for President Bush's $1 trillion deficit."</P>

<P>

 Jill Holtzman Vogel, chief counsel for the Republican National Committee, argued in her letter to television stations that the ads violate federal campaign law because they name a federal candidate - Bush - in an effort to influence the election. </P>

<P>

 But Andrews said the groups aren't saying to vote for any particular candidate. Andrews contends that Win Without War's Iraq ads debate the war and its justification, which is at the heart of a democratic society.</P>

<P>

 "One of the questions is: What will these elections be about?" Andrews said. "Some people think it will be about gay marraige. Some people think it should be about flag burning or prayer in schools. We think that no matter how you come down on these elections, who you end up voting for for any federal office - president, Congress, Senate - that at least we as Americans should have a debate on the most important public issues, and we think the security of our country is the most important public issue."</P>
