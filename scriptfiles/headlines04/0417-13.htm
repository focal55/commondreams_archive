international law and United Nations resolutions, President Bush should be
pressuring both sides to stem the violence and start talking again," said
Jim Winkler, general secretary of the United Methodist Church General Board
of Church and Society.
<p>
"President Bush has effectively told the world that what Israel has taken by
force from the Palestinians is now acceptable. This is a roadmap to war," he
added in a statement Thursday signed by more than a dozen churches united as
the Churches for Middle East Peace (CMEP).
<p>
In a letter to Prime Minister Sharon, who visited Washington on Wednesday,
Bush assented to the Israeli leader's plan to withdraw all settlements from
the disputed Gaza Strip while retaining larger settlements in the West
Bank -- the first time a U.S. president has ignored that the lands have been
the subject of legal contention since they were seized by Israel in 1967.
<p>
Bush also backed Sharon's assertion that any returning refugees must settle
in territory now occupied by Palestinians and would have no claim on land
seized by Israel since they left the country.
<p>
Blair said Thursday that the roadmap is still valid, but echoed the argument
of Sharon and Bush that "changes on the ground" made Sharon's new plan
imperative.
<p>
"Until we manage to get in place the basic elements of security so that we
can then start the co-operative, bilateral approach that the roadmap sets
out, then inevitably we're going to be looking for other things that can
allow us to make some progress," Blair told reporters after meeting U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
<p>
The roadmap stipulates that Israelis and Palestinians take concurrent and
parallel steps en route to creating an independent and viable Palestinian
state -- whose borders would be determined in negotiations between the two
parties -- alongside Israel by 2005.
<p>
While Palestinians must halt violence against Israel and launch economic and
political reforms, Israel is required to start withdrawing its forces from
key West Bank towns and ease its grip on the Occupied Territories by, among
other steps, freezing settlement activity and dismantling the scores of
illegal settlements that have been created by Israeli settlers since the
Palestinian Intifadah began in September 2000.
<p>
Since the roadmap was unveiled last year, Palestinians have chosen new
leaders. Yet attacks against Israel have continued, while Israel has started
construction of a mammoth wall, ostensibly for security reasons, which would
annex large chunks of Palestinian land.
<p>
Annan himself panned the Bush-Sharon accord. "The secretary-general
reiterates his position that final status issues should be determined in
negotiations between the parties based on relevant Security Council
resolutions," his spokesman said in a statement Wednesday.
<p>
"He strongly believes that they should refrain from taking any steps that
would pre-empt the outcome of such talks."
<p>
While the Palestinian authority of Yasser Arafat simply called the U.S.
position "biased", a leader of the Hamas group said the letters signal the
failure of the peace process, and "only prove that armed resistance is the
only option for the Palestinians".
<p>
One peace activist said the deal certainly narrows Palestinians' immediate
options. "I think the big loss here for both the Israelis and the
Palestinians is that America in the future (cannot) be a broker of
negotiations," said Lewis Roth, assistant executive director of Americans
for Peace Now.
<p>
"To have the U.S. come out and make some predetermined statements about
these issues really eliminates any sort of reason for the Palestinians to
sit down" and negotiate, he told IPS.
<p>
While Roth did not believe the upcoming U.S. presidential election played a
large role in this week's entente -- calling Bush's Mideast policy
"reactive" -- one church spokesman said it was designed to boost the
standing of Sharon, who is under investigation for corruption and must still
push his plan for unilateral withdrawal through his divided Likud Party.
<p>
"The president's decision, contrary to the public, long-standing positions
of many U.S. Protestant and Orthodox churches and of the Catholic Church, is
de facto a rejection of international law," said CMEP Executive Director
Corinne Whitlatch. "He has clearly shown that the U.S. is not as concerned
for the rights of the Palestinian people as it is for the political goals of
Prime Minister Sharon."
<p>
"We had hoped that the Gaza withdrawal could be a first forward step toward
peace," Whitlatch added Thursday, but Bush's "repeated assurance that he
wants a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel is losing
credibility. The president's blatant disregard for Palestinian and Arab
participation and sentiment places a future peace and our own security at
risk."
<p>
In a prescient article prior to this week's meeting, James Zogby of the Arab
American Institute wrote that the then rumoured deal would enable Israel to
"protect huge Israeli settlements, which will now be linked even more
directly with pre-1967 Israel. This is what is known as establishing 'facts
on the ground'."
<p>
"At the same time, Sharon will now be able to 'withdraw' from a devastated
and impoverished Gaza while maintaining full control over all of Gaza's
borders and reserving the right to re-enter and wreak havoc whenever Israel
deems it necessary to do so."
<p>
"The U.S. will maintain that this is not a final agreement, only a temporary
measure and that the roadmap is still operative," added Zogby. "But the
reality on the ground will be quite different. The U.S. letter will enable
Sharon to lock in Palestinian despair and kill the hope for a just peace."
