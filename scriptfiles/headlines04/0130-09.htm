<p>WASHINGTON  - 
President Bush  sought to quell a
rebellion from his fiscally conservative base with a pledge on
Friday to still halve the deficit over five years even as
estimates showed his new prescription drug plan would cost far
more than expected.

<!--/endimage/-->Bush faces the prospect of an election-year fight with
Republican conservatives over the cost of implementing new
Medicare reforms. He may also face challenges from moderates in
his own party over proposed cutbacks in domestic spending.
<p>
 The fiscal 2005 budget Bush will send to Congress on Monday
will call for limiting spending growth outside of defense and
homeland security to 0.5 percent -- well below the rate of
inflation.
<p>
 But his budget will also acknowledge that adding
prescription drug coverage to Medicare would cost at least &#36;530
billion over 10 years -- 33 percent more than the &#36;400 billion
Congress and the administration had promised when the law was
approved less than two months ago.
<p>
 The higher estimate cast doubt on Bush's plans to cut the
deficit in half by 2009. Many budget experts -- including some
of Bush's allies in Congress -- were already skeptical. The
White House expects this year's budget deficit to reach a
record &#36;521 billion -- a potential election-year liability.
<p>
 But Bush insisted: "The budget we'll submit on Monday does
fulfill that promise that will reduce the deficit in half."
<p>
 Traditional allies of the Republican administration, many
fiscally conservative opposed the Medicare plan, in part
because of the huge long-term cost of providing drugs to
seniors as the baby boom generation retires.
 <p>
 They seized on the White House's new cost estimate as
vindication, and warned that Bush could face an election-year
backlash over spending.
 <p>
 "The real question is what did the president know and when
did he know it," said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for
Growth, a politically powerful conservative group.
 <p>
 He called the new cost estimate a "financial scandal."
 <p>
 The White House denied it intentionally underestimated the
cost of the Medicare law to pick up votes during the
congressional debate.
 <p>
 Bush told reporters he learned about the new estimate two
weeks ago, and asserted that increased competition would
eventually hold down the cost of Medicare.
 <p>
 While he said his 2005 budget would call for cutting the
deficit in half over five years, Bush put the onus on the
Republican-controlled Congress to hold the line on spending.
 <p>
 "Congress is now going to have to work with us to make sure
that we set priorities and are fiscally wise with the
taxpayers' money. I'm confident they can do that, if they're
willing to make tough choices," Bush told reporters.
 <p>
 Officials said the discrepancy between the drug cost
estimates reflected long-standing differences in assumptions
the White House and Congress make about the program,
particularly how many people will choose to participate and how
much it will help to reduce drug costs.
 <p>
 But conservatives were not appeased.
 <p>
 They said Bush has overseen a nearly 25 percent surge in
spending over the last three years -- the fastest pace since
the Johnson administration of the mid-1960s.
<p>
 "Pardon me if I sound cynical," said William Niskanen, the
chairman of the libertarian Cato Institute who advised former
President Ronald Reagan.
<p>
Republican lawmakers who oversee the spending process could
also rebel.
<p>
They warned this week that Bush's plan to freeze some
federal spending could mean painful cuts in programs ranging
from veterans' health to medical research.
<p>
"There is simply no good reason to prevent such work from continuing to completion."
