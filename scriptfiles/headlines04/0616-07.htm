<p>Senate Democrats slammed the US State Department for leaving on <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/" target="_new">its website</a> an error-laden report concluding terror attacks were on the wane, when the opposite was true.

<p>"I'm ... troubled by the inexplicable willingness on the part of the State Department to keep the terrorist report on their website," Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle told a press conference Tuesday.

<p>"Even the secretary of state last Sunday acknowledged ... factual misrepresentations in the report. And yet we found as late as this morning that this terrorism report is still posted on their website," he said. 

<p>"It doesn't make sense."

<p>Some critics have suggested that the annual "Patterns of Global Terrorism" report, published April 29, purposely misstated the number of attacks in 2003 in an election-year effort to show that US President George W. Bush's hardline anti-terrorist policies were working.

<p>Secretary of State Colin Powell said over the weekend, and again on Monday, that the errors were inadvertent and would be corrected.

<p>"I have an understanding of how the mistakes were made and now what we have to do is make sure that we've got it fixed and we've got the right data. It will not be as shocking as people are speculating upon," Powell said.

<p>The website did say Tuesday that a corrected version would be issued by the State Department.

<p>"At our request, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center is revising the statistics for calendar year 2003," said a statement posted on the website, next to hyperlinks to the uncorrected report.

<p>"While we are still checking data for accuracy and completeness, we can say that our preliminary results indicate that the figures for the number of attacks and casualties will be up sharply from what was published," the statement said.

<p>"As soon as we are in a position to, we will issue corrected numbers, a revised analysis, and revisions to the report," the statement said.

<p>Daschle said the admission that the figures were wrong should have prompted the department to remove the flawed information from its website.

<p>"They need to pull that erroneous terrorism report down ... in concert with pronounced expressions of regret and a public commitment made by the secretary himself to fix the circumstances that were reported last week regarding the report," he said.

<p>"I'm hopeful that that will happen sometime soon. For the life of me, I can't understand why they would continue to allow access to a report that is as erroneous as this terrorism report ... (has) now been found to be."
