<p>Even by the previous standards of Bushisms, this was one for the ages.
<p>Signing into law a new $417bn (£229bn) defense spending bill, the famously tongue-twisted 43rd President of the United States solemnly declared yesterday that his administration "will never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people".

<p>The gaffe came as President George Bush was warming to his favorite theme of the terrorist threat faced by the US.
<p>"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," he said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."
<p>Steeled doubtless by long experience of oratorical mis-steps by the President, the audience of senior military commanders and the Pentagon's civilian leadership gave no outward reaction.
<p>Mr Bush quickly continued to his wider point, that "we must never stop thinking about how best to defend our country. We must always be forward-thinking."
<p>Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said the mistake merely showed that "even the most straightforward and plain-spoken people misspeak."
<p>But the American public knew that "this president speaks with clarity and conviction, and the terrorists know by his actions he means it."
