<p>BANGKOK - With one in four new HIV cases being 
reported from Asia, the sprawling continent is on the verge of 
being felled by an AIDS epidemic that would dwarf the devastation 
wrought by the killer disease in Africa, experts warned.
</b> 
<p>
                  
   ''Asia now is facing life and death choices when it comes to the 
epidemic,'' Kathleen Cravero, deputy executive director of the Joint 
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), said here 
Tuesday at the launch of a global report on the pandemic.
<p>
   If the region fails to implement effective prevention programs, 
''we will see an epidemic the likes of which we never imagined 
despite what has happened in Africa,'' she said.
<p>
   By the end of 2003, Asia had an estimated 7.4 million people 
living with HIV out of the 38 million adults and children infected 
with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) world-wide, the 
'2004 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic' revealed.
<p>
   During that year, close to half a million people are estimated to 
have died by the virus that causes AIDS, while 1.1 million people 
became newly infected, the 231-page report added.
<p>
   Such a grim picture has been fed by the rapid increase in HIV 
infections from two of Asia's most populous countries -- China 
and Indonesia - and nearby Vietnam.
<p>
  ''In China, 10 million people may be infected with HIV by 2010 
unless effective action is taken,'' the UNAIDS report warned, while 
in Indonesia six of the country's 31 provinces ''are badly affected.''
<p>
  These three country's are among the region's most populous, 
with China being home to 1.3 billion people, Indonesia having 203 
million people and Vietnam has 77 million people.
<p>
  To compound that is the report's remarks on India: it has ''the 
largest number of people living with HIV outside South Africa - 
estimated at 4.6 million in 2002.''
<p>
  Yet it is a picture that is deceptive and can result in complacency, 
given the criteria used - percentage of population -- to calculate if a 
country's HIV prevalence rate has reached a point to be deemed 
an epidemic.
<p>
   In this light, countries like China, India, and Indonesia appear 
marginally affected when set against the high percentages in 
African countries reeling under the AIDS epidemic.
<p>
   According to the UNAIDS report, China and Indonesia have 0.1 
percent of their population aged between 15 - 49 years infected 
with HIV, as opposed to Botswana, which has 37.3 percent of the 
population infected with HIV, South Africa having 21.5 percent of 
HIV prevalence and Zimbabwe, with 24.5 percent HIV prevalence.
<p>
   Of the Asian countries, only Cambodia, Thailand and Burma 
have the percentages to be considered facing an AIDS epidemic, 
with Cambodia being the worst affected with 2.6 percent of its 
population suffering from HIV and Thailand with 1.5 percent.
<p>
   Such low percentages, though, cannot be glossed over, 
asserted Cravero, since Asia is ''potentially worse than Africa 
because of the numbers.''
<p>
   What are also setting the two continents apart are the factors that 
have fueled the rapid spread of HIV. In Asia, injecting drug use 
has been a major contributor, states the report.
<p>
   ''Among injecting drug users, HIV prevalence is 35-80 percent in 
Xinjiang, and 20 percent in Guangdong,'' the report notes in 
reference to two provinces in China.
<p>
   HIV prevalence rate among Indonesia's 125,000-195,000 
injecting drug users ''has increased three-fold - from 16 percent to 
48 percent between 1999 and 2003,'' the report states.
<p>
   ''In 2002 and 2003, HIV prevalence ranged from 66 percent to 93 
percent among injecting drug users attending testing sites in the 
capital city, Jakarta,'' it adds.
<p>
   Furthermore, sex between men has also been identified as a 
reason for the escalating HIV rates in Asia. ''HIV transmission 
through sex between men is a major cause for concern in many 
areas of India,'' the report states.
<p>
   South Asian sex workers are also vulnerable to the spread of 
HIV, due to low condom use by their male clients. In Bangladesh, 
the report notes, ''most of the men do not use condoms in their 
commercial sex encounters and female sex workers report the 
lowest condom use in the region.''
<p>
   Yet HIV/AIDS activists say that this reality will not change unless 
the region's government pursue a more enlightened approach, 
particularly in policies to bring those who inject drugs into the fold 
of AIDS prevention and care.
<p>
   Most detrimental to the region would be punitive polices such as 
the one pursued in 2003 by the Thai government of Prime Minister 
Thaksin Shinawatra against drug users, Paisan Suwannawong, 
director of the Thai Treatment Action Group, told IPS.
<p>
   That year, the Thaksin administration launched a harsh 'war on 
drugs' to rid the country of its amphetamine addiction, but this 
nine-month campaign resulted in over 2,200 people being killed 
for allegedly being part of the country's narcotics trade.
<p>
   ''The 'war on drugs' forced intravenous drug users underground 
out of fear that they will be killed or be put on a list of being a drug 
user,'' Paisan added. ''Many drug users stopped going to the 
treatment centers.''
<p>
   On Tuesday, HIV/AIDS activists announced the plans they would 
pursue during the 15th International AIDS Conference to be held in 
Bangkok from Jul. 11-16 to lobby governments to see vulnerable 
groups in Asia in a more sympathetic light.
<p>
   ''Governments must not use violence against drug users, and 
should encourage peer driven approaches to help these 
vulnerable groups,'' said Kamol Uppakaew, chairman of the Thai 
Network of People Living With HIV/AIDS.
