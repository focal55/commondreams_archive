GAZA  - Palestinians accused the United States on  Friday of granting Israel a license to kill by vetoing U.N.  condemnation of its assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed  Yassin.
<p> 
			
			Israeli forces killed two Hamas frogmen who came ashore  overnight near a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip, after the  Islamic militant group said it would launch "earthquake-like"  attacks to avenge Yassin.
<p> 
			
			A car exploded near the West Bank city of Nablus, killing a  militant who was apparently rigging it as a bomb. The  22-year-old Palestinian, from an armed faction of President  Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, was cut in half by the blast.
<p> 
			
			At the United Nations, the United States late on Thursday  vetoed a Security Council resolution by Arab nations to censure  Israel for assassinating Hamas's wheelchair-bound founder in a  missile strike outside a Gaza mosque on Monday.
<p> 
			
			Washington, alone among major powers in not condemning  Monday's assassination as an extrajudicial killing, rejected  the resolution because it did not also denounce Hamas for  suicide bombings in Israel. The vote was 11 in favor, three  abstentions, and the United States veto that killed the  measure.
<p> 
			
			"Israel's action has escalated tensions in Gaza and the  region, and could set back our effort to resume progress toward  peace," U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte said in a statement.
<p> 
			
			But he added: "This Security Council does nothing to  contribute to a peaceful settlement when it condemns one  party's actions and turns a blind eye to everything else  occurring in the region."
<p> 
			
			Palestinians denounced the U.S. action, and 10,000 people  demonstrated in the West Bank against Yassin's killing.
<p> 
			
			"I'm afraid this U.S. veto will be taken by Israel as  encouragement to continue on the path of violence and  escalation, assassinations and reoccupation" of Palestinian  territory, cabinet minister Saeb Erekat told Reuters.
<p> 
			
			Calling the United States the "chairman of the axis of evil  in the world," Hamas political leader Mohammad Ghazal said the  veto was "Israel's green light to carry out assaults and  crimes."
<p> 
			
			An Israeli government official in Jerusalem welcomed the  U.S. veto but expressed disappointment that Washington had been  left no other option. "We are troubled by this cynical attempt  to condemn those who are fighting terrorism without denouncing  the terrorists themselves," he said.
<p> 
			
			TEHRAN MARCH
<p> 
			
			In Tehran, 5,000 people marched in protest against Yassin's  killing, chanting "Death to Israel, death to America."
<p> 
			
			Worshippers at Friday prayers in the Gaza mosque where  Yassin had prayed minutes before his assassination wept and  demanded revenge as they looked upon the empty spot where the  paralyzed 67-year-old cleric used to sit in his wheelchair.
<p> 
			
			In the Security Council, Britain, Germany and Romania  abstained after Algeria, negotiating for Arab nations, rejected  an amendment they wanted that would have condemned "atrocities"  against Israelis.
<p> 
			
			The Algerian draft condemned "the most recent extrajudicial  execution committed by Israel" and "all attacks against any  civilians as well as all acts of violence and destruction."
<p> 
			
			The measure was backed by China, Russia, Algeria, Pakistan,  Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, France, Spain and the  Philippines.
<p> 
			
			Israel is vowing to kill more militants it sees as the  masterminds behind suicide bombings that have killed hundreds  of Israelis during a nearly 3-1/2 year Palestinian uprising.
<p> 
			
			Hamas, bent on Israel's destruction, has threatened to  target Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and other top officials.
<p> 
			
			Hamas said two of its fighters were the frogmen who mounted  a "unique naval operation" near the Tel Katifa settlement and  "ascended to heaven as martyrs" after battling Israeli troops.
<p> 
			
			A Hamas videotape showed the two 18-year-olds in wetsuits,  diving masks pushed back and scuba tanks strapped on, vowing  "revenge against the Jews" before setting out. The tape also  showed a training simulation filled with gunfire and  explosions.
<p> 
			
Meshaal, speaking from Damascus in a telephone hookup piped  through loudspeakers, told a crowd of 5,000 Hamas supporters in  the West Bank city of Ramallah: "We will keep... sacrificing  our dearest until the occupation leaves our land."
