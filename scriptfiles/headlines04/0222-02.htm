<p>WASHINGTON  - Ralph Nader, whose third-party White  House bid in 2000 was blamed by some Democrats for helping  elect President Bush, said on Sunday he will try again this  year as an independent.

Ignoring pleas from Democrats to stay out of the race, the  veteran consumer advocate said he wanted to challenge the two  parties' stranglehold on the political process and their shared  addiction to corporate interests.
<p> 
			
							"Washington is corporate-occupied territory, and the two  parties are ferociously competing to see who is going to go to  the White House and take orders from their corporate  paymasters," Nader said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
<p> 
			
							Nader said claims that his candidacy would distract from  efforts to beat Bush in November were a "contemptuous" attempt  to restrict democracy and maintain what he called the  "two-party duopoly."
<p> 
			
							"It is an offense to deny millions of people who might want  to vote for our candidacy an opportunity to vote," he said,  adding the "corporate government" practiced by both parties had  led to rollbacks in labor, environmental and economic  standards.
<p> 
			
							"This country has more problems and injustices than it  deserves," Nader said. "It's time to change the equation and  bring millions of American people into the political arena."
<p> 
			
							Nader's Green Party bid won nearly 2.9 million votes in  2000 and was blamed for siphoning support from Democrat Al Gore  -- particularly in Florida, where Nader won 97,488 votes and  Gore's loss by a bitterly contested 537 votes cost him the  presidency.
<p> 
			
							Nader started an exploratory committee late last year to  raise money for a presidential run. He had ruled out another  bid for the Green Party, which was split on his candidacy and  will not pick its nominee until this summer.
<p> 
			
							"I've decided to run as an independent candidate for  president," he said.
<p> 
			
							A public opinion poll in October found two-thirds of  Americans did not want Nader to run again, and Democrats from  across the ideological spectrum have asked him to stay out of  the race and give them a clear shot at Bush.
<p> 
			
							An entire liberal Internet Web site, <a href="http://www.ralphdontrun.net" target="_new">ralphdontrun.net</a>, is  devoted to urging Nader not to run again.
<p> 
			
							"Unlike 2000, there is no need for an alternative  progressive voice, because we have progressive candidates in  the primary that will challenge the Democratic Party's shift to  the right," said civil rights activist Al Sharpton, who is  making his own presidential bid as a Democrat.
<p> 
			
							Democrats expect Nader to have less of an impact this year  than in 2000, saying party and left-wing activists have learned  how wrong Nader was when he claimed in 2000 there was no  difference between the two parties.
<p> 
			
							"I don't think he'll have a sizeable impact, but it's  terrible if he goes ahead because it's about him, it's about  his ego, it's about his vanity and not about a movement," New  Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said on "Fox News Sunday."
<p> 
			
							Democratic presidential front-runner John Kerry told  reporters on Saturday night he was not afraid that a Nader  candidacy would hurt his potential challenge to Bush. "I think  my campaign is speaking to a lot of the issues Ralph Nader is  concerned about," Kerry said in Atlanta, Georgia.
<p> 
			
							Nader admitted that he would have some difficulty meeting  the requirements to qualify for all 50 state ballots in the  November election, describing the process as "like climbing a  cliff with a slippery rope."
<p> 
			
							"This isn't just our fight," he said. "This is a fight for  all third parties ... I don't think America belongs just to the  Democratic and Republican parties."
