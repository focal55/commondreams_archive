<p>WASHINGTON - A federal appeals court on Tuesday
overturned a Bush administration decision to weaken
energy-efficiency standards for new air conditioners, a move
which could save American consumers &#36;20 billion and avoid the
need for up to 200 new electricity plants by 2030.
<p>
 In 2001, 10 states including New York, California, New
Jersey and Massachusetts sued the U.S. Department of Energy to
block it from scaling back an increase in minimum air
conditioner energy-efficiency standards.
 <p>
 The Bush administration wanted to require air conditioners
and heat pumps manufactured after January 2006 to become 20
percent more efficient, not the stricter 30 percent improvement
required under a previous Clinton-era rule.
 <p>
 Air conditioners can account for about one-third of all
U.S. electricity use during hot summer days when demand is the
highest.
 <p>
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that
the Energy Department lacks the authority to revoke such rules
once they are published as final rules. It cited a
"no-rollback" provision contained in an appliance standard law
which Congress passed in 1987.
 <p>
 New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the ruling
means that the Bush administration cannot unilaterally change
laws passed by Congress.
 <p>
 "In dark of night this administration cannot rewrite the
laws -- Congress writes the laws," Spitzer said in an
interview.
 <p>
 The stricter standards could help U.S. utilities avoid the
need to build 200 new power plants and save consumers a
cumulative &#36;20 billion in electricity bills by 2030, the
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said.
 <p>
 The group said it based its projection on the assumption
that small, 100-megawatt plants used to meet peak demand would
not be needed.
 <p>
 The Bush administration withdrew the final rule in May 2002
and weakened it under pressure from some appliance makers.
Activist groups and Democrats have criticized a series of White
House environmental policy changes as catering to industry
demands for less costly regulations.
 <p>
 The Energy Department is disappointed by the court's
decision and is reviewing it, a spokesman said.
 <p>
 The Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, an
industry group, said the decision was flawed because it was
"determined on process rather than on the impact of the
regulation on millions of people." The group said it is
weighing challenging the decision in court.
 <p>
 Consumer watchdogs said the stricter efficiency standards
could help take pressure off tight U.S. natural gas supplies,
because summertime electricity demand is met mostly with
clean-burning natural gas-fired power plants.
 <p>
 "Air conditioning creates one of the biggest draws on the
system when it is most vulnerable -- those hot summer
afternoons," said Mark Cooper, an economist with the Consumer
Federation of America, which also joined in the lawsuit.
