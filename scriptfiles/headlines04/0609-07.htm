<p>STOCKHOLM  - World military spending leapt 11  percent in 2003 due to a "massive increase" from the U.S. war  on terror but the pace may slow down as Washington's  pre-emptive strike policy comes under pressure, says a leading  think-tank.
<p> 
			
The United States accounted for almost half the $956  billion total, which grew by 18 percent in real terms during  2002 and 2003, the <a href="http://www.sipri.se/" target="_new">Stockholm International Peace Research  Institute</a> said on Wednesday.
<p> 
			
SIPRI, whose security data is widely respected, said in its  2003 Yearbook the U.S.-led war in Iraq had not helped democracy  in the Arab world but instead opened "new fronts and incentives  for terrorism" which had "outweighed any deterrent effect."<p> 
			
			While not ruling out that Washington "could yet succeed in  building a democratic Iraq," it warned ongoing violence could  lead to it "becoming a failed state or even descending into  civil war."<p> 
			
			U.S. military spending has been driven up by President  Bush's doctrine of pre-emptive strikes in response to the al  Qaeda attacks on September 11, 2001. The trend reverses a  decade's decline from 1987-98 and moderate growth in 1998-2001.<p> 
			
			U.S. arms outlays will continue to grow, SIPRI said, but  the pace may slow as the pre-emptive war doctrine is challenged  "on both ethical and international law grounds, as well as  because of the large costs and dubious successes associated  with it."<p> 
			
			The White House has proposed a steady increase in military  spending over the next five years to $487.8 billion, starting  with a 7.0 percent rise for financial 2005. But with federal  budget deficits mushrooming, there is pressure for cuts.<p> 
			
			VICTORS' JUSTICE<p> 
			
			Three-quarters of world military spending is done by rich  countries accounting for 16 percent of the planet's population.  Their military budget is more than the foreign debt of all poor  countries combined and 10 times what is spent on aid.<p> 
			
			But despite the rise in world military spending, 2003 also  registered the second lowest number of armed conflicts  worldwide -- 19 -- and highest number of new peace missions  launched -- 14 -- in any single year since the end of the Cold  War, SIPRI said.<p> 
			
			International law also made advances, with the  International Criminal Court moving "from a paper court to a  fully functioning one" and $1.0 billion spent on international  courts.<p> 
			
			But a Special Tribunal set up in Iraq to try ousted leader  Saddam Hussein and his followers "could arguably be seen as a  reversion to a system based on victors' justice," SIPRI said.<p> 
			
			The United States and Russia remained the world's major  weapons suppliers, arming Taiwan, Egypt, Britain, Greece,  Turkey and Japan in the U.S. case and China and India in  Russia's case.<p> 
			
			Efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons suffered a  setback in 2003, with North Korea becoming the first country to  withdraw from the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and evidence  that Iran had acquired nuclear technology, SIPRI said.<p> 
			
			But Libya's decision to abandon weapons of mass  destruction, and Iran's to disclose its nuclear program, could  mean "a unique opportunity to work toward the goal of  establishing a WMD-free zone in the Middle East."<p> 
			
			Control of ballistic missiles had been improved by tighter  checks on weapons and money transfers between suppliers and  recipients including some of "the most secretive countries in  the world" like China, Iran, North Korea and Syria, SIPRI said.<p> 
			
			It underlined the risk of biotechnology being used for "a  new class" of weapons targeting cardiovascular, immunological,  neurological and gastrointestinal systems in the human body.<p> 
			
			But such attacks by aerosol and on water supplies or crops  would not cause mass casualties, and reports that al Qaeda and  the Taliban might use biological attacks were "ambiguous," it  said.
