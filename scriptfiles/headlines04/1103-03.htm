      <p>WASHINGTON - Voters across the United States reported problems with electronic 
        touch-screen systems on Tuesday in what critics said could be a sign that 
        the machines used by one-third of the population were prone to error. 
      <p> Voters calling in to an election-day hotline reported more than 1,100 
        problems with the ATM-like machines, from improperly tallied choices to 
        frozen screens that left their votes in limbo.

            November 2, 2004. The hotline, which recorded calls and logged voters 
            complaints, processed more than 50,000 calls from voters. (Tim Shaffer/Reuters)<br>

      Voters in Maryland said congressional candidates were left off ballots, 
      while some in Florida told hotline volunteers that their ballots had already 
      been filled out when they stepped up to vote, watchdogs said. 
      <p> Machines in New Orleans, Miami and suburban Philadelphia failed to start 
        punctually in the morning, leading to long lines at polling places and 
        prompting some to turn away from the polls, according to activists with 
        the Election Protection Coalition. 
      <p> The nonpartisan group said it had received 1,166 complaints as of late 
        evening involving a wide array of machines. 
      <p> "It gives us the uneasy feeling that we're only seeing the tip of the 
        iceberg," said Cindy Cohn, legal director of the <a href="http://www.eff.org/" target="_new">Electronic 
        Frontier Foundation</a>, a technology-policy group involved in the coalition. 
      <p> Officials with voting-systems companies said most problems could be 
        traced to human error, rather than the equipment. 
      <p> "Everything we see and hear and talking to our members who are in turn 
        in touch with election officials seems to be very positive," said Bob 
        Cohen, a spokesman with the Information Technology Association of America, 
        which counts voting-system vendors such as Diebold Inc. among its members. 
      <p> About 45 million registered voters are expected to cast a ballot on 
        touch-screen systems, which have been touted by election officials as 
        a way to avoid a repeat of the messy recount battle touched off by antiquated 
        punch-card systems in Florida four years ago. 
      <p> Computer scientists say the machines are prone to the glitches and security 
        holes all too familiar to home-computer users. 
      <p> The controversy has prompted some states to postpone upgrades until 
        after the election, even though the federal government has earmarked &#36;3.9 
        billion for that purpose. 
      <p> The most common complaint was that machines had recorded votes improperly. 
        Most said they were able to go back and fix the problem, a feature that 
        ITAA's Cohen said did not exist in paper-based systems. 
      <p> But Cohn of the EFF said nobody knew how many votes were cast improperly 
        without the voter noticing. 
      <p> In Palm Beach County, Florida, some voters found that ballots had already 
        been filled out when they logged in, said Matt Zimmerman, an EFF attorney 
        who is observing the election there. 
      <p> A spokesman for the company that makes the machines said that was probably 
        because the previous voter had walked away before finishing the ballot. 
        Depending on local regulations, poll workers will finish the process or 
        cancel it, he said. 
      <p> "Voters do some amazing things. It's not a frailty of the system or 
        the equipment," said Alfie Charles, spokesman for Sequoia Voting Systems 
        Inc. 
      <p> In Maryland, voters have complained that Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, 
        Democratic Rep. Albert Wynn and Republican Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger did 
        not appear on ballots, said Linda Schade, co-founder of the activist group 
        <a href="http://www.truevotemd.org/" target="_new">TrueVoteMD</a>.
