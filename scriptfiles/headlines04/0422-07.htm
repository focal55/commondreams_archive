SEOUL  - Up to 3,000 people were killed or injured  when two trains loaded with fuel collided and exploded at a  North Korean station on Thursday, hours after leader Kim  Jong-il had passed through, South Korea's YTN television said.
<p> 
			
			South Korea's Yonhap news agency, which spoke of widespread  destruction, said there were thousands of casualties and some  form of emergency had been declared in the area near the border  with China.<p>

"The station was destroyed as if hit by a bombardment and  debris flew high into the sky," Yonhap said, quoting  unidentified Chinese sources. YTN in its report quoted  witnesses.<p> 
			
			Neither Yonhap nor YTN gave a breakdown of deaths and  injuries and there was no independent confirmation of the  reports.<p> 
			
			Communist North Korea, one of the world's most reclusive  and impoverished countries, has not said anything on the  disaster.<p> 
			
			Yonhap quoted sources in the Chinese city of Dandong that  borders the North as saying the explosion occurred around 1  p.m. (0000 EDT) -- nine hours after Kim's special train was  reported to have passed on its way to Pyongyang after a visit  to China.<p> 
			
			The sources said trains carrying gasoline and liquefied  petroleum gas collided at Ryongchon station 10 miles south of  the Yalu river border near the Yellow Sea.<p> 
			
			There were rumors the fuel was a gift from China to Kim and  his energy-starved country, Yonhap said.<p> 
			
			Ryongchon is transliterated as Yongchon in South Korea and  appears that way on most maps in the West.<p> 
			
			Yonhap also quoted a senior Defense Ministry official as  saying the South's military -- which eavesdrops on North Korea  -- had heard about the blast through "intelligence channels  directed against the North."<p> 
			
			The United States, which runs the largest intelligence  gathering operation on the North, said it had no confirmation  of the blast.<p> 
			
			"I don't think we know enough about the situation yet to  know whether there's any assistance that we have that might be  necessary," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.<p> 
			
			There was no immediate suggestion the blast was anything  other than an accident.<p> 
			
			But the explosion came after Kim met China's new leadership  during a rare foreign visit to discuss the North's nuclear  weapons plans, tentative economic reforms and aid that has in  the past included fuel.<p> 
			
			NO MENTION<p> 
			
			North Korea's official media made no mention of the  disaster, but earlier on Thursday they broke their silence on  Kim's three-day trip to Beijing -- strongly suggesting he was  safely back.<p> 
			
			International telephone lines to the area appear to have  been cut to prevent information about the explosion getting  out, Yonhap added.<p> 
			
			The North's creaking medical system would be hard pressed  to cope with a large number of casualties, but there was no  word any international agency or neighboring country had been  asked for help.<p> 
			
			"We have not yet received official information on the  accident. We are trying to confirm the report," a Unification  Ministry spokesman said in Seoul. Other officials at various  government agencies also had no information.<p> 
			
			At the United Nations in New York, a North Korean diplomat  said he had no information except what he had heard from  outside reports.<p> 
			
			Yonhap said the Chinese sources said people in Dandong were  concerned their friends or relatives could have been caught up  in the blast. Traders from both sides criss-cross the border  area.<p> 
			
			A railway worker on the Chinese side of the Dandong border  crossing told Reuters he had not heard of a blast and had seen  no signs of any emergency effort under way.<p> 
			
			"The closest station to here in North Korea is in Sinuiju  (on the border), and I would have heard it. But I didn't hear  anything," he said by telephone.<p> 
			
			Residents in Pyongyang said by telephone there was nothing  unusual in the capital. North Korean television was  broadcasting military songs and music -- standard evening fare.<p> 
			
			Masood Hyder, the World Food Program coordinator in  Pyongyang, said he was not sure if or when the government might  inform his agency of the reported accident.<p> 
			
			"It's not necessary that they would tell us," he said by  telephone. "Often it's the foreign news that confirms things  even before they admit to it."<p> 
			
			North Korea suffers from debilitating food and energy  shortages. Energy assistance is an integral part of  multinational talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear  programs. A Seoul National University professor Chang Dal-joong  said North Korean officials had confessed energy shortage was  one of the biggest problems the country faced.
