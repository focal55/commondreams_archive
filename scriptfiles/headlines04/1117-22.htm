<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>DUBAI  - Arabs were torn between seething rage at  images of a U.S. soldier shooting dead a wounded Iraqi in a  mosque and dismay at Iraqi insurgents in Falluja for turning  holy mosques into battlegrounds.
<P>
Viewers said images, which Arab televisions aired  repeatedly of a Marine killing a severely injured Iraqi, fueled  growing hatred against America and helped create more  "terrorists."
<P>
"I am not a jihadist, I am just a normal Muslim but such  scenes are pushing me to Jihad," said Dubai-based engineer  Abdallah. "We don't expect this from the representative of  democracy in the world."
<P>

"This is one of the things we saw on TV. God knows how many  crimes they have committed which we have not seen," he added."
<P>
In Saudi Arabia -- the birthplace of Islam and of al Qaeda  leader Osama bin Laden, whose group carried out bombings in the  country -- residents said insurgents were to blame for taking  their battle into mosques.
<P>
"If I was in the U.S. soldier's place I would have killed  all the insurgents because they are mercenaries," said Saudi  Zaher al-Saleh, a 32-year-old teacher. "They have turned the  mosques into battlefields and they're killing civilians."
<P>
Islamist extremists called for revenge through their Web  sites and cursed pro-U.S. Muslim leaders for remaining silent.
<P>
"Oh God your enemies have killed your believers in one of  your houses. God take revenge for us," one chatter said.
<P>
<b>PERSONAL AFFRONT
</b><P>
Some Muslims saw the killing as a personal affront.
<P>
"It's as if they had killed every one of us. Today, it's  that poor man, tomorrow, it will be me," said Sherine Mohamed,  27, a financial analyst. "Even if militants didn't respect  mosque sanctities, U.S. soldiers should have done so because  they claim to help Iraqis."
<P>Muslims said pictures showing Marines lounging with their  guns in a Falluja mosque were "insulting."
<P>
They said soldiers "sullied the ground with their boots" at  the mosque where Muslims are obliged to take off their shoes in  respect for the house of God.
<P>
"They are entering dangerous waters. If they think they are  getting rid of terrorists this way, they are mistaken. They are  creating more terrorists than killing them," added Abdallah.
<P>
International human rights groups said the killing could  amount to a war crime and showed the need to better train U.S.  forces about the laws of war.
<P>

The U.S. military opened an investigation into whether the  Marine acted in self-defense, broke U.S. military law or  committed a war crime in the fatal shooting of a wounded Iraqi  in Falluja, the scene of fierce fighting between U.S. forces  and Iraqi and Islamist militants in the past week.
<P>
That shooting was caught on videotape by an NBC television  crew embedded with the Marines.
<P>
The United Arab Emirates' Al-Ittihad newspaper said the  killing was "shocking and provocative" and demanded Washington  investigate the "horrifying crime."
<P>
"If this crime goes unpunished it will set a dangerous  precedent in U.S. policies and will destroy everything (good)  it has done for Iraq," it added.
<P>
Arab animosity toward U.S. presence in Iraq has ratcheted  up since the Abu Ghraib prison scandal that resulted in the  sentencing of several U.S. soldiers.
<P>
Lebanon's Shi'ite Muslim Hizbollah TV al-Manar led its  newscasts with the shooting and said it showed "the ugliness of  the actions that occupation forces are carrying out in Iraq."
<P>
"U.S. forces violating laws and committing atrocities is  not new. What has surfaced is only a small part of what Iraqis  are facing," said Shehab al-Ahdal, editor-in-chief of Yemen's  al-Nahar newspaper.
