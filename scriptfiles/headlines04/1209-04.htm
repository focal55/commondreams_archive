<p>Embattled UN Secretary General Kofi Annan got a standing ovation from diplomats from around the world here, in what UN officials said was a show of support at a time of crisis.

<P>Facing calls to resign from some US politicians and the United Nations under fire over corruption allegations, Annan won hearty applause after a speech in the General Assembly on reforming the United Nations.

<P>"You have just received a rare and exceptionally warm tribute by the General Assembly," assembly president Jean Ping of Gabon told the gathering after Annan's speech.

<P>"This long standing ovation is an expression of the support of member states to your action, and the trust member states have in you as a person for the work that you continue to undertake at the helm of the United Nations," he said.

<P>"In a world faced with doubt, confusion and even confrontation, you have been and remain a point of reference, a source of inspiration and wisdom for millions of persons in the world," Ping said.

<P>Nations from across the globe have expressed support in recent days for Annan, who appeared before the assembly to formally present a report he commissioned on revitalising the UN system.

<P>Annan has been under mounting pressure over the UN's supervision of Iraqi oil sales under Saddam Hussein's regime, in particular concerning new revelations about payments to his son Kojo.

<P>There has been no indication that Annan profited but the UN chief admitted there was a "perception problem" after it emerged Kojo kept receiving payments until February from a Swiss firm working under the programme.

<P>Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard on Wednesday again shrugged off calls for the secretary general's resignation, saying that no member states in the 191-nation world body have made any such statement.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2004 AFP</p>
