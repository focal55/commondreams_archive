<p>WASHINGTON  - 

The U.S. economy created just
112,000 new jobs in January, far fewer than expected,
government data showed on Friday in a disappointing report that
will likely weigh on President Bush's re-election campaign.
<p>
 The fifth straight monthly gain in payrolls outside the
farming sector was the largest since December 2000, the Labor
Department  said. However, its report still showed weak hiring
26 months after the economy climbed out of recession.

  </table></font><!--/endimage/-->"The payrolls number was well below market expectations and
confirms the jobs market in the U.S. is weak," said Daniel
Tenengauzer, vice president for foreign exchange at Lehman
Brothers.
<p>
 Analysts had been expecting the economy, which has been
showing strength in areas outside the jobs market, to add
150,000 new jobs in January after an originally reported gain
of only 1,000 the previous month. The department revised the
December figure to an increase of 16,000.
<p>
 HEALTHY GROWTH BUT FEW JOBS
<p>
 Economists say the United States needs to add 150,000 jobs
a month just to keep pace with growth in the labor force and to
keep the unemployment rate steady. Since September, only
366,000 jobs have been added, or just over 70,000 a month.
<p>
 "This is the weakest job creation rate relative to economic
growth on record," said Steven Wood, an economist at Insight
Economics.
<p>
 The economy grew at a healthy 4 percent annual rate in the
final quarter of last year after a soaring 8.2 percent pace in
the previous three months.
<p>
 January's unemployment rate ticked down to 5.6 percent, the
lowest in two years, from 5.7 percent in December. Analysts
were looking for the unemployment rate to hold steady.
<p>
 The payrolls data is taken from a survey of employers,
while the jobless rate is derived from a separate, smaller
survey of households.
<p>
 The dollar and stock futures initially slipped after the
report and Treasury bond prices rose. Market expectations of a
healthy report were boosted on Thursday when Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke said he was "pretty confident" there
would be an improvement in employment in the near future.
<p>
 Stocks recovered later, however, as the market began to
perceive that the soft jobs number would make the Fed keep
interest rates low. A revival in the jobs market is seen as
crucial for a sustained economic recovery and the central bank
is expected to keep rates on hold until signs of this emerge.
<p>
 "These numbers will not change the Fed's thinking," said
Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group.
"The Fed is on hold for the time being."
<p>
 JOB ISSUE LOOMS IN ELECTION
<p>
 The weak labor market is expected to be a major issue among
candidates in the presidential election. Since Bush took
office, 2.2 million jobs have been lost and his opponents say
his economic policies have helped the wealthy and done little
to create jobs.
<p>
 Many of the new jobs in January came from a 76,000 increase
in the retail sector.
<p>
 The Labor Department said that was because some retailers
took on fewer employees than expected in November and December
for the holiday season. This meant they did not shed as many
afterwards, affecting the seasonal adjustment factor.
<p>
The troubled manufacturing sector cut jobs for the 42nd
month in a row, despite some signs of a revival in factories
seen in other economic data.
<p>
Employment in temporary help services fell for the first
time since April 2003. Economists say temporary hiring often
rises ahead of more-permanent hiring.
<p>
The report included annual benchmark revisions but these
did not lead to a major change in the overall picture of a weak
jobs market.
<p>
The Labor Department defended the accuracy of the
employment count based on its survey of payrolls, disputing
criticism the poll fails to capture jobs created by new
businesses.
<p>
One bright spot in the report was a 24,000 increase in
construction. Low mortgage rates have helped to fuel a housing
boom.
<p>
In another encouraging sign for job seekers, hours of work
rose to 33.7 per week from 33.5 in December. Employers often
lean more heavily on existing employees before hiring more.
<p>
Average hourly earnings rose to &#36;15.49 from &#36;15.47 the
previous month, the report showed.
