<p>LONDON  - The government is 
            considering a plan to break up the BBC and remove its independent 
            status in the wake of a bitter row with the state-funded broadcaster 
            over the Iraq  war, a report said. 
    <P>Government papers detailing possible changes to the BBC's 
            structure proposed breaking it into separate regional entities for 
            England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, The Sunday Times 
            said. 
<p>The documents, which the newspaper said had been drawn up by 
            "senior civil servants", also suggested that the job of ensuring the 
            BBC's impartiality could be taken away from the corporation's board 
            of governors. 
<p>The BBC, which is independently run despite being financed by 
            public money through a compulsory television licence, is currently 
            facing perhaps the worst breakdown in relations with the government 
            in its 82-year history. 
<p>The dispute came after a BBC radio report alleged in May last 
            year that Prime Minister Tony Blair's government deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by 
            Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction in a pre-war dossier. 
<p>Government weapons expert David Kelly was later identified as the 
            anonymous source of the charge. Kelly killed himself soon 
            afterwards. 
<p>An inquiry into Kelly's death, led by judge Lord Brian Hutton, 
            concluded last month that the BBC's story had been "unfounded", a 
            verdict which forced the corporation to apologise, with the 
            corporation's chairman and director general resigning. 
<p>According to The Sunday Times, the new plans for the BBC will 
            bring accusations that "the government is gearing up to exploit the 
            fall-out from the Hutton inquiry". 
<p>Plans being considered include giving a government media watchdog 
            greater control over the BBC's output, closing BBC outlets which are 
            not considered "public service" and even forcing the corporation to 
            share some of its licence fee revenue with other broadcasters. 
<p>Such a move would most likely prompt public concern, given that 
            the BBC is still generally revered in Britain for being impartial 
            and accurate. 
<p>Opinion polls after the Hutton inquiry was published showed that 
            many people considered its verdict a "whitewash", and that they 
            trusted the BBC far more than they did Blair and his ministers.
