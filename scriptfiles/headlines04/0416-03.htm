<p>Dennis Kucinich began his political activism during his high school years. He was involved in many extracurricular activities and went to community meetings to find out what was going on in his neighborhood.
<p>He soon realized he wanted to be involved in national politics, but he didn&#039;t know how.

Now an Ohio congressman and a Democratic presidential candidate, Kucinich spoke to several hundred Corvallis High School students Thursday morning, urging them to be active and pursue their interests.
<p>It was Kucinich&#039;s second stop in Corvallis, after a rally at a downtown business earlier this month. Later Thursday, Kucinich spoke at Oregon State University, and in Salem and Gladstone. Today he&#039;ll speak in Vancouver, Wash., and Portland.
<p>&quot;What you think about America and the world today is just as valid as what anybody else thinks,&quot; Kucinich said in front of a nearly full auditorium that included school staff and community members. &quot;You&#039;re not just preparing for the future. You are the future.&quot;
<p>Kucinich told the students their future was ahead of them and it&#039;s important to make good decisions.
<p>&quot;Whatever you want to do, it doesn&#039;t all depend on one thing happening in life. It&#039;s a series of steps,&quot; he said.
<p>Kucinich reminded the students that media such as television, radio and newspapers aren&#039;t the only ways to quickly spread information. There&#039;s also word of mouth, the Internet and putting up flyers.
<p>&quot;It&#039;s so important knowing how you can get the word out. Don&#039;t ever sell yourself short about getting a message out,&quot; he said.
<p>Kucinich concluded his time at the school by answering questions from students. Those questions ranged from why he&#039;s still in the race for president even though Sen. John Kerry has enough votes to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, to whether he favors legalizing marijuana.
<p>He&#039;s still in the race, Kucinich said, because he wants to refocus the Democratic Party. He favors legalizing marijuana and putting the focus on treatment.
<p>He received the biggest support from the audience when he spoke about his displeasure with the invasion of Iraq.
<p>&quot;What&#039;s happening in Iraq is something else,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#039;m very blatant about these things because there&#039;s no time to waste.&quot;
<p>Several CHS students invited Kucinich to the school after learning during last month&#039;s model convention in Portland that the politician was interested in meeting with and talking to young people.
<p>&quot;It&#039;s just amazing that we got a presidential candidate to a high school,&quot; said CHS senior Jeff DeGroot, who hopes to attend Whitman College in the fall and major in political science. Helping organize the event was his first opportunity to experience what a campaign is all about.
<p>DeGroot said he was attracted to Kucinich&#039;s views on several issues, including ending the occupation of Iraq and providing universal health care to all Americans.
<p>&quot;I was at the mock convention and I really wanted to have him here. He seemed to be to be very genuine,&quot; added fellow senior Becca Cooper, who helped plan Kucinich&#039;s visit. &quot;If we stand up and talk about what we believe in, things like this will happen.&quot;
<p><b>QUOTABLE: Dennis Kucinich on … </b>
<p><b>Being informed and standing behind what you believe:</b> &quot;I think the greatest source of information is the human heart. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to trust yourself in what you think.&quot;
<p><b>Having a plan in life:</b> &quot;I want to let you know there&#039;s authenticity in that. You&#039;re the architect in that plan, the laborer, the builder.&quot;
<p><b>Having your message heard:</b> &quot;It&#039;s important that if you want to be heard that you take that step forward. And often it&#039;s that first step that&#039;s the most crucial.&quot;
