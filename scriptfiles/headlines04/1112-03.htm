<p>WASHINGTON  - 
A CIA  analyst who wrote a book that
criticized the U.S. war on terror has resigned from the spy
agency after it effectively banned him from publicly discussing
his views, his publicist said on Thursday.
<p>
 Michael Scheuer, whose book "<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574888498/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Imperial Hubris: Why the West
Is Losing the War on Terror</a></em>" was signed as "anonymous" and
published this summer, will resign effective Friday after 22
years at the Central Intelligence Agency.
<p>
 In a statement, Scheuer said the CIA had not forced him to
resign, "but I have concluded that there has not been adequate
national debate over the nature of the threat posed by Osama
bin Laden  and the forces he leads and inspires, and the nature
and dimensions of intelligence reform needed to address that
threat."
<p>
 He intends to speak to the media over the next several
weeks, including an appearance on the CBS show "60 Minutes" on
Sunday.
<p>
 Scheuer's statement said senior leadership had allowed the
intelligence officers working against al Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden to be made scapegoats for pre-Sept. 11 failures.
<p>
 Scheuer was chief of the CIA Counterterrorist Center's unit
which focused on bin Laden from 1996 to 1999 and remained a CIA
analyst after that.
<p>

 "The Atlantic Monthly" in its December issue published a
letter sent by Scheuer to U.S. congressional intelligence
committees that said the key pre-Sept. 11 intelligence failures
were mainly the result of bad decisions by senior officials.
<p>
 "While the 11 September attacks probably were unstoppable,
it was decisions by human beings -- featuring arrogance, bad
judgment, disdain for expertise, and bureaucratic cowardice --
that made sure the Intelligence Community did not operate
optimally to defend America," Scheuer said in the letter.
<p>
 In June, just before Scheuer's book was published, he did a
series of media interviews, appearing on TV in silhouette and
was identified in print as "Mike."
<p>
 In the first week of August, CIA officials told him that he
had to ask for permission in advance for media interviews and
provide summaries of what would be discussed ahead of time,
Scheuer's editor and publicist Christina Davidson said.
<p>
 "They rejected every single request," she said. "It was
effectively a ban."
<p>
 His book said the United States was losing the war against
terrorism and that sticking to current policies would only make
its enemies in the Islamic world grow stronger.
<p>
 The statement released by his publicist about Scheuer's
resignation said that "after a cordial meeting with senior CIA
officials on Tuesday, Scheuer decided that it would be in the
best interests of the intelligence community and the country
for him to resign in order to continue speaking publicly with
regard to Osama Bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the 9-11 Commission
Report." A CIA spokeswoman had no immediate comment.</p>
