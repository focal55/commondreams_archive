<p>PARIS - Two Frenchmen described as hell Friday  their more than two years of detention in the U.S. military  prison at Guantanamo Bay, their lawyer said after meeting them  for the first time.<p> 
			
			Mourad Benchellali and Nizar Sassi had concerns "about the  interrogation techniques and medical experiments" at  Guantanamo, Jacques Debray said outside the headquarters of the  DST domestic intelligence service where the two men were being  questioned.<p> 
			
			A letter from Sassi said "bizarre" medicines had been given  to inmates at night and that one caused some prisoners to break  out in spots, Debray told reporters. He gave no other details.<p> 
			
			"Each of (the two men) used the same expression, 'We have  emerged from hell'," Debray said.<p> 
			
			"This is huge for them because it's the first time in  two-and-a-half years that they have been able to talk to  someone other than a soldier or a police officer, apart from  their fellow detainees."<p> 
			
			Debray said he would request a full medical examination for  his clients when they were brought before anti-terrorism judges  Saturday.<p> 
			
			Under French law, defense attorneys have access to clients  only after 72 hours of detention. Lawyers can see case notes  once suspects are brought before an examining magistrate.<p> 
			
			Two other former Guantanamo detainees, Imad Kanouni and  Brahim Yadel, are being questioned alongside Benchellali and  Sassi at DST headquarters.<p> 
			
			All four were detained by French authorities on their  return to France from the U.S. base in Cuba Tuesday aboard a  military plane.<p> 
			
			The four were captured during the U.S.-led war in  Afghanistan and held by American forces on suspicion of having  fought for the ousted Taliban government.<p> 
			
			President Jacques Chirac said this week the four had been  returned to France after lengthy talks with U.S. authorities  and pledged they would face French justice.<p> 
			
			Three other Frenchmen remain in Guantanamo.<p>
