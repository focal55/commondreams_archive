<p>MEXICO CITY - ”No More Bush”: It has become a slogan echoed
with increasing frequency, on signs and banners carried by protesters and
painted on walls throughout Latin America.
<p> <p>
					  
					  
Today, with the U.S. presidential election drawing near, this sentiment has
come to be shared by the majority of the region's politicians,
intellectuals, and even heads of state.
<p><p>
Since Bush took office in 2001, the proportion of people with negative
opinions towards the United States in Latin America and the Caribbean has
doubled, according to surveys carried out by Latinobarometro, a Chile-based
firm.
<p><p>
An international poll conducted by GlobeScan of Toronto, Canada and the
University of Maryland in the United States revealed that 42.5 percent of
those surveyed in nine Latin American countries would like to see Democratic
Party candidate John Kerry win the Nov. 2 election, while only 19 percent
support the re-election of Bush, a Republican.
<p><p>
This anti-Bush stance was clearly expressed back in March, when tens of
thousands of protesters took to the streets throughout Latin America,
voicing their opposition to the U.S. president and his invasion of Iraq
exactly one year earlier.
<p><p>
According to some observers, a win by Kerry would not do much to change
Washington's current policies towards the region, and there are even those
who believe things could worsen.
<p><p>
However, in the view of Venezuelan historian Samuel Moncada, ”Anything is
better than Bush.” Moncada, who is close to the left-leaning government of
President Hugo Chávez, told IPS, ”We believe Bush is a fanatic, a
fundamentalist. He thinks he talks to God. He is dangerous, and we have felt
the sting firsthand.”
<p><p>
Relations between Caracas and Washington have been acrimonious since Bush
took power. Chávez has accused the U.S. president of plotting to overthrow
him, and has gone so far as to publicly call him an ”idiot”.
<p><p>
While the Venezuelan president has openly expressed his hopes that Kerry
will defeat the ”Republican extreme right”, the other governments of the
region have adopted a more diplomatic tone.
<p><p>
Nevertheless, in Argentina, for example, the government's preference for
Kerry was clearly demonstrated by the presence of Senator Cristina
Fernández -- President Néstor Kirchner's wife -- at the Democratic Party
Convention that made Kerry's nomination official.
<p><p>
In any event, according to Argentine Foreign Minister Rafael Bielsa, his
country is ”not a priority for the United States” at this point in time.
<p><p>
In Cuba, where the government of Fidel Castro views Bush as a global
dictator, the speaker of the National Assembly (parliament), Ricardo
Alarcón, said that his country is not expecting any changes in U.S. policy
no matter who wins the election in November.
<p><p>
Kerry ”talks about maintaining the embargo and the pressure (on Cuba); it's
the same stance, although with slightly less aggressive rhetoric, perhaps,”
Alarcón said.
<p><p>
Bush and Kerry both share the view that the four-decade embargo against Cuba
should remain in place until Castro falls.
<p><p>
As for the impact that the election could have on Latin America, Alarcón
said he doesn't know, ”because it's an issue that isn't being discussed at
all in the United States.”
<p><p>
Washington is too caught up in the ”war on terrorism” launched by Bush ”to
be worrying about countries that have ultimately never interested them,” he
noted.
<p><p>
Esteban Morales, from the University of Havana's Centre for U.S. Studies,
said that if Cuba has managed to survive the Bush administration, ”which has
done everything possible to step up the aggression towards Cuba, then in the
future, no matter what happens, this policy is destined to fall into a
definitive crisis.”
<p><p>
Lawmaker María José da Conceiçao, deputy chair of the Brazilian Chamber of
Deputies' Foreign Affairs and National Defence Commission, told IPS that she
prefers Kerry because the Democratic Party is ”more open on human rights and
the environment,” and this will benefit democracy everywhere, including
Latin America.
<p><p>
Moreover, if Bush is re-elected, it will only serve to further reinforce his
”warmongering” and ”arrogant” attitudes, she said.
<p><p>
”The vast majority of Brazilian parliamentarians, including many
conservatives, prefer Kerry, and are anti-Bush,” noted Da Conceiçao, a
member of the leftist ruling Workers Party.
<p><p>
In any event, ”the foreign policy of the Democrats is not very different
from that of the Republicans, and when it comes to foreign trade, they're
even more protectionist,” she added.
<p><p>
Mexican diplomat Adolfo Aguilar, formerly his country's representative to
the United Nations Security Council, believes it is difficult and even
inadvisable to take sides, because neither of the major U.S. parties has a
long-term and consistent vision for Latin America.
<p><p>
In the very limited statements they have made on Latin America-related
strategy, both Bush and Kerry have spoken in rather broad terms.
<p><p>
Bush promises to continue promoting free trade in and with the region, under
a model rejected in countries like Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, whose
governments believe that Washington fails to take into account the
differences in development found in the countries of the hemisphere.
<p><p>
Kerry has accused Bush of following a ”one-note policy toward Latin America
of one-size-fits-all trade agreements.” He himself has promised to evaluate
the free trade agreements being negotiated, in order to ensure that they
”provide economic benefits, create jobs and include strong protections for
labour and the environment.”
<p><p>
He has also said that he will take the free trade agreement between the
United States and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua
back to the negotiating table. The agreement was signed in May, but has yet
to receive legislative approval from the participating countries.
<p><p>
He will do the same, he added, with negotiations for the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA), a project involving 34 countries and promoted by
Washington, which hopes to see it put into effect by 2005.
<p><p>
As president, Kerry said, he would ”help forge a new and broader community
of the Americas, where neighbours look after neighbours.
<p><p>
”Instead of being a good neighbour,” he said, ”the president (Bush) has
ignored a wide range of ills - including political and financial crises,”
such as those faced by Argentina, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela in recent
years.
<p><p>
For his part, Kerry promises to create a ”Council for Democracy” which will
help the Organisation of American States ”resolve crises before order is
threatened and blood is spilled.” He has further pledged to provide funding
for programmes aimed at strengthening democracy in Latin America.
<p><p>
Matías Machado, a Mexican foreign trade specialist, told IPS that the
positions on foreign trade held by Kerry and his team appear highly
protectionist, although ”we will have to wait and see how they really work
in practice if he becomes president.”
<p><p>
Chilean analyst Eduardo Moraga said a Kerry triumph would affect all of the
countries that trade with the United States, because all of the agreements
signed by Bush would be painstakingly reviewed.
<p><p>
It is unlikely, however, that this would affect the agreement already in
force between the United States and Chile.
<p><p>
José Morandé, of the University of Chile's International Studies Institute,
noted that this particular agreement was one of the few gestures made by the
United States towards Latin America during the Bush administration, and
Kerry ”is not going to get himself in trouble” with the region by
questioning it.
<p><p>
John Edwards, Kerry's running mate, has been a fervent opponent of free
trade deals with Latin America, alleging that they are not sustainable and
that they take jobs away from the United States.
<p><p>
In Congress, Edwards waged a campaign against the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) adopted by Canada, Mexico and the United States in 1994.
He also voted against preferential trade agreements with the countries of
Central America, the Caribbean and the Andean region, and opposed the free
trade accord with Chile.
