WASHINGTON - Global environmental groups are hailing the decision by Monsanto Company, the world's biggest seller of genetically modified (GM) sales, to suspend further development of its genetically engineered (GE) Roundup Ready wheat. 
<p>
 The company announced the suspension at its headquarters in St. Louis Monday, saying that it had suspended development of the wheat, which would have been able to resist Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, primarily for economic reasons. The suspension means that it will also discontinue breeding and field-level research of the crop, as well.
<p>
 "As a result of our portfolio review and dialogue with wheat industry leaders," said Carl Casale, Monsanto's executive vice president, "we recognize that business opportunities with Roundup Ready spring wheat are less attractive relative to Monsanto's other commercial priorities."
<p>
 But green groups that have campaigned against the introduction of GE and GM crops, hailed the news as a major victory for their cause.
<p>
 "This is a victory for the environment, farmers and consumers," said Pat Venditti, Genetic Engineering Campaigner for Greenpeace. "Strong rejection of GE wheat from virtually every corner of the globe once again showed the resistance to GE foods." 
<p>
 Juan Lopez of Friends of the Earth International (FoEI) in Brussels also praised the decision, stressing that it Monsanto was effectively bowing to economic necessity.
<p>
 "Virtually every major wheat-user in the world had already rejected this product before it was allowed on the market," he said. "This must be one of the most rejected products ever developed and is another major financial blow to Monsanto. The corporation should get out of this unwanted GM crops business once and for all."
<p>
 The groups noted that Monsanto made a similar decision last year when it announced its withdrawal from development of pharmaceutical crops.
<p>
 A leader in bio-technology that had successfully introduced Roundup Ready corn and soybean food grains in the U.S., Monsanto has been battered by a public international campaign led by Greenpeace, FoEI, and other independent environmental, health, and farmers' groups that strongly opposes the introduction of any more of what they call "Frankenfoods." 
<p>
 They have generally been backed by the European Union  (EU) and several Asian countries that together represent a huge market for grain exporters. The company failed to get GM crops approved for import or cultivation in Europe for the past six years.
<p>
 As a result, the Canadian Wheat Board had opposed the release of Roundup Ready wheat. It had found that 87 percent of Canadian wheat buyers now require non-GE certification of wheat. Another survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) of possible export markets found only four - Peru, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Yemen - willing to buy it.
<p>
 The campaign has also been strengthened by growing evidence that many GM crops have not lived up to the claims of their boosters, such as the notion that they would need less fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides than conventional crops. 
<p>
 Incidents in which GM grain has been mixed with conventional grain and evidence that some characteristics of GM crops have spread to nearby plants or weeds have also fed fears that they could be destructive to human health or the environment. Farmers have also been concerned that the spread of GM crops would lead to corporate control of much of the world's food supply.
<p>
 "Let's hope GE wheat permanently joins GE flax, GE tomatoes, and GE potatoes in the dustbin of bad ideas," said Venditti. "Rather than having to restage this battle in four years' time, we hope that Monsanto has heard loud and clear that GE wheat is a non-starter."
<p>
 "Monsanto may call this a corporate realignment, but it's really a full retreat," said Joseph Mendelson, legal director for the Washington-based Center for Food Safety (CFS), which filed a petition with the USDA to prevent regulatory approval of GE wheat. "For Monsanto to pull the plug on biotech wheat at this stage, could hardly be more significant. The company has been forced to face reality - the market didn't want this wheat and Monsanto itself is in a struggle for its very survival."

<p>
 The company said it began technical development of Roundup Ready wheat in 1997 and that its scientists were satisfied that the product performs well under the most difficult production environments for spring-planted wheat and could increase yields from five to 15 percent over conventional varieties.
<p>
It also said it had budgeted less than US&#36;5 million this year on the product, or less than one percent of the company's &#36;500 million research and development budget.
