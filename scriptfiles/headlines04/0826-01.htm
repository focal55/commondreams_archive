<p>NEW YORK  - A giant clock ticking the cost of the  war in Iraq lit up in Times Square on Wednesday, making its  debut by flashing $134.5 billion.
<P>
The amount on the clock will grow at a rate of $177 million  a day, $7.4 million an hour and $122,820 per minute, said the  advocacy group <a href="http://www.projectbillboard.org/" target="_new">Project Billboard</a> which put it up.

Project Billboard is supported by the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/" target="_new">Center for American  Progress</a>, a liberal think tank headed by John Podesta who  served as chief of staff under former President Bill Clinton.
<P>
The clock was unveiled just days before Republicans gather  in New York for their national convention.
<P>
As intended, it caught the eye of many passersby in the  busy intersection.
<P>
"Just think of the things you could do with that money,"  said tour guide Farah Perez. "No way am I voting for Bush."
<P>
The message may not reach everyone, however, as the clock  sits above a much larger billboard of a woman wearing nothing  but a pair of sneakers.
<P>
"First I saw the other billboard, but then I saw the cost  of the Iraq war and the number took my breath away," said  passerby Greg Boris. "Then I went back to looking at the other  billboard.
<P>
"That money should be spent here in the United States," he  added.
<P>
The new clock sits just a couple of blocks away from a spot  where an earlier clock used to flash the growing size of the  U.S. national debt.
<P>
This clock is part of a legal settlement reached between  Project Billboard and Clear Channel Communications after the  advocacy group sued the media giant for breaking a contract  over the posting of an antiwar billboard in Times Square during  this month's convention.
<P>
Clear Channel settled the case by agreeing to give Project  Billboard two Times Square locations instead of one. In return,  the group dropped its plan for a bomb graphic that Clear  Channel said it found distasteful.
<P>
The advocacy group's other billboard displays a large peace  dove and the words "Democracy Is Best Taught By Example, Not By  War."
<P>
Both billboards are scheduled to run for four months, said  a spokesman for Project Billboard
