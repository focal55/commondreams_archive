WASHINGTON  - Environmental groups responded with dismay on Thursday to a report from a panel of government advisers that says it might be OK to test pesticides on people if the strictest care is taken. 


<p> 
<p>
 The Natural Resources Defense Council called it an
"appalling suggestion" while the Environmental Working Group
said the chemical industry could not be trusted to follow
government testing guidelines.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 The advisory National Research Council  panel said the
government should accept tests using human subjects but
cautioned there had better be a good reason and the strictest
care must be taken to protect volunteers.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 It recommended reversing a six-year-old Environmental
Protection Agency moratorium on accepting human testing
results.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 "Human studies involving pesticides, air pollutants, or
other toxicants -- as opposed to therapeutic agents -- are
particularly controversial, and because of this, EPA should
subject these studies to the highest level of scientific and
ethical scrutiny," said James Childress, a professor of ethics
and medical education at the University of Virginia, who helped
chair the panel.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 "Our report proposes a framework for EPA's oversight of
this research. And the recommended framework should apply to
studies that are sponsored by so-called 'third parties' --
private companies or other sources outside the agency -- as
well as by EPA."
 
<p>
   
<p>
 The controversy over human testing of toxic chemicals began
in 1996 when Congress passed the Food Quality and Protection
Act, which tightened safety standards on pesticides.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 Some chemical manufacturers complained the new standards
were based on the worst possible effects that chemicals could
have on lab animals and said the best way to prove their
products were safe was to start testing them on people.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 PAID TO DRINK CHEMICALS
 
<p>
   
<p>
 So some companies started paying volunteers to eat or drink
pesticides and other chemicals.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 Environmental groups complained and helped persuade the EPA
in 1998 to reject findings based on such studies until the
controversy could be settled.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 EPA then asked the National Research Council, one of the
independent, advisory National Academies of Science, to study
the matter.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 "Our report in 1998 shows that pesticide companies are more
about profits than human health," Environmental Working Group
president Ken Cook said in a statement.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 "We cannot trust that the chemical industry will abide by
voluntary ethical measures and not abuse loopholes in testing
guidelines."
 
<p>
   
<p>
 The Natural Resources Defense Council agreed.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 "The academy report calls for the highest ethical and
scientific standards, but undermines its own recommendations by
making the appalling suggestion that it is OK to experiment
with toxins on kids," said the council's Erik Olson.
 
<p>
   
<p>
 "The report also shockingly says that federal agencies
should accept the results of old, ethically questionable
experiments with toxic chemicals on people unless there is
'clear and convincing evidence' that they were intended to hurt
people or were otherwise absurdly unethical."
 
<p>
   
<p>
 But CropLife America, which represents agricultural and
chemical companies, welcomed the report.
<p>
"Our industry is ethically and legally bound to provide
regulators the information they need to determine that products
are safe as they set stringent guidelines for their proper
use," it said in a statement.
<p>
"Our industry follows the safety procedures and directives
established by Congress, EPA, the courts and international
scientific organizations, such as the Common Rule, Declaration
of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice," it added.
<p>
"As the ... report identifies, it is in the public's
interest to maintain the availability of products that protect
public health by controlling disease-carrying pests, such as
mosquitoes, ticks and cockroaches, and that ensure an abundant,
affordable high-quality food supply."
