<p>BAGHDAD - Iraq's top Sunni Muslim party said  Monday it was withdrawing from Jan. 30 elections because  relentless bloodshed would keep people from voting in the long  dominant Sunni north and west.
<p> 
			
			"The Iraqi Islamic Party is withdrawing from the elections  because we do not think the situation will improve in the next  few weeks to give conditions for credible elections," party  Secretary-General Tareq al-Hashimi said.<p> 
			
			Persistent violence in Sunni Arab cities, most of which are  under curfew, has raised fears that voters there will be too  intimidated to cast their ballots, skewing the poll in favor of  Iraq's 60-percent Shi'ite Muslim majority.<p> 
			
			The Islamic Party's list of 275 candidates would still  appear on ballot papers which were already being printed, a  spokesman for Iraq's Electoral Commission told Reuters.<p> 
			
			Farid Ayar said the Commission had received no formal  request for withdrawal, but if it does, any votes cast for the  Iraqi Islamic Party would be considered "invalid."<p> 
			
			The leading mainstream Sunni religious party, along with at  least 16 other Sunni and secular parties, had threatened to  boycott the poll unless it was postponed by up to six months to  ensure that voters across the country could take part.<p> 
			
			But most, including the Islamic Party itself, later fielded  lists of candidates for the poll to elect a 275-seat National  Assembly that will draft a constitution and appoint a cabinet.<p> 
			
			Iraq's long-oppressed Shi'ites are keen that the poll,  expected to cement their political power after the ouster of  Saddam Hussein, take place.  The New York Times quoted unnamed U.S. officials Sunday saying  Washington was considering giving Sunnis extra seats in  parliament should Sunnis fail to vote, to avoid marginalizing  the 20-percent minority that was dominant under Saddam.<p> 
			
			One way of doing that might be to appoint legislators from  those Sunni provinces where voting was severely disrupted.<p> 
			
			The Electoral Commission dismissed those suggestions and  the Islamic Party said such a scheme would be undemocratic.<p> 
			
			"There cannot be comprehensive elections unless they  include all of Iraq's provinces. These provinces cannot accept  that... they have people appointed. This will not convince us  or others," said Iraqi Islamic Party leader Mohsen Abdul Hamid.<p> 
			
			The Iraqi Islamic Party is one of Iraq's older parties, set  up in the 1960s with links to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.<p> 
			
			It was suppressed by Saddam, but was on the defunct Iraq  Governing Council picked by Washington after the war, and has  deputies in the 100-seat National Council set up in August.<p> 
			
			The Islamic Party withdrew its one minister from Iraq's  interim government to protest against last month's U.S. assault  on the Sunni city of Falluja, once a rebel nerve center.<p> 
			
			But Industry Minister Hajem al-Hassani, left the party and  kept his post instead. Last month, U.S.-led forces detained a  top party official who is deputy head of the National Assembly.
