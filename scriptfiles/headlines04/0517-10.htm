<p>PLAINFIELD - Another world is possible, and preferable, according to social
justice activists who gathered at Goddard College this weekend.
<p>The peace-seekers, who came from Vermont and beyond, listened to 69 speakers,
met in groups, and watched videos dealing with social inequities and environmental
concerns at the &quot;Another World is Possible&quot; conference.
</p>
<p>While the workshops sought to give examples of actions those seeking change
can take, the workshops also served as an energizer for those who attended.
</p>
<p>&quot;It's essential to get together in these settings to celebrate the work
that we're doing,&quot; said Tim Keating, executive director of Rainforest Relief,
a New York-based rainforest protection and advocacy group.
</p>
<p>Keating was a speaker on Saturday, the second day of the three-day event,
which featured social justice movers and shakers including Shujaa Graham,
a former death row inmate and Black Panther, Zia Mian, a South Asia and
disarmament issues scholar and activist from Princeton University, and Medea
Benjamin, the founding director of Global Exchange, an international human
rights organization.
</p>
<p>Keating told those who listened to his discussion, titled &quot;Rainforest Lunch,&quot;
that Americans play a large role in depleting the rainforests of tropical
hardwoods that are going extinct.
</p>
<p>Keating said it was great not just to have interest in his presentation
but to have the chance to hear from other, similar-minded people. He likened
to hear from other, similar-minded people. He likened working for social
change to &quot;going up the stairs in Shea Stadium when the game is getting
out.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It's really what it feels like, you're paddling up river,&quot; Keating said
in an interview, after plucking dandelion greens from the Goddard lawn.
&quot;But when you get together, it feels like you have 20 people in your boat.&quot;
</p>
<p>The speakers spoke inside the Haybarn auditorium at Goddard, which was hung
with posters saying &quot;Another World is Possible,&quot; &quot;War is Not the Answer&quot;
and &quot;Can Democracy Survive Militarism.&quot;
</p>
<p>The concept for the event came from the idea of the World Social Forums,
larger-scale events being held around the world, according to an organizer.
Several Vermont high school students recently made a trip to the World Social
Forum in India.
</p>
<p>Agustus Young, a 28-year-old Burlington man, volunteered to organize the
&quot;Another World is Possible&quot; event and attended the discussions. He called
the mission of the conference &quot;very ambitious&quot; in its intent to discuss
economic, environmental and social issues.
</p>
<p>Young said Sunday that that cooperative effort was essential, a theme he
took away from the event: &quot;It is the response of individuals to manifest
the changes they want to see ... and to cooperatively manifest the changes
they want to see.&quot;
