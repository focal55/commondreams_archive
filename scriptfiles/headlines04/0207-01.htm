<p>WASHINGTON - If United States Vice President Dick Cheney was hoping 
                        that the cold, crisp air of Davos and his private 
                        audience with Pope John Paul II late last 
                        month would revive his spirits, as well as&nbsp;       
                                   
                                  
                                 his 
                        standing in the polls, he must be deeply disappointed. 
<p>Since returning home, he has faced a seemingly 
                        unrelenting succession of disclosures and attacks that 
                        appear to get worse with each passing day. What the 
                        albatross was to the ancient mariner, Cheney is fast 
                        becoming to George W Bush's re-election chances. 
<p>Just consider what happened to Cheney Thursday: 
                        the early morning edition of the Wall Street Journal ran 
                        an article - first reported by Newsweek - on how Justice 
                        Department investigators had asked Halliburton Company 
                        for documents relating to US$180 million in allegedly 
                        illegal payments by a consortium of companies, including 
                        Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, in 
                        connection with the construction of a big natural-gas 
                        plant in Nigeria in the late 1990s, while Cheney was 
                        Halliburton's chief executive officer. <p>When the 
                        Los Angeles Times hit the news stands a couple of hours 
                        later, Cheney was right there on the front page with the 
                        headline: "Scalia was Cheney Hunt Trip Guest; Ethics 
                        Concern Grows." Antonin Scalia is a Supreme Court 
                        Justice who was Cheney's guest on a recent and rather 
                        costly (to the taxpayer) bird-hunting trip to Louisiana, 
                        and who also will soon hear a major case on government 
                        secrecy in which the vice president is the defendant. 
                        <p>Legal ethics experts quoted in the story, of 
                        course, zeroed in on the question of whether Scalia 
                        might best recuse himself from hearing the case, but 
                        there were also suggestions that perhaps Cheney could 
                        have exercised slightly better judgment."It is not 
                        just a trip with a litigant. It's a trip at the expense 
                        of the litigant," noted one law professor. 
                        <p>Finished with the morning papers, Cheney may 
                        have tuned in to watch Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
                        director George Tenet deliver a passionate defense at 
                        Georgetown University of the official intelligence 
                        community's performance in the runup to the Iraq war, 
                        only to find himself a target, if only inferentially. 
                        <p>While Tenet didn't say anything explicitly about 
                        Cheney, he certainly didn't do much to dispel the 
                        increasingly strong impression in Washington - among 
                        Democrats, it's become a conviction - that, of all of 
                        Bush's senior advisers, Cheney and his staff worked 
                        hardest to hype what the intelligence community was 
                        saying about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's 
                        alleged weapons of mass destruction programs. 
                        <p>While the intelligence community had concluded 
                        that Saddam wanted nuclear weapons, Tenet declared, it 
                        also made clear as of late 2002 that Saddam had none, 
                        and that he probably would not have been able to make 
                        one until some time between 2007 and 2009, at the 
                        earliest. <p>That assertion, of course, raises a 
                        major question. If the intelligence community agreed 
                        that Saddam had no nuclear weapons, where did Cheney get 
                        the information that would substantiate his statement on 
                        the very day that the US launched its invasion last 
                        March: "And we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted 
                        nuclear weapons." <p>The answer, according to 
                        Democratic members of the Congressional intelligence 
                        committees, who have become increasingly outspoken in 
                        recent days, is that Cheney and his staff had an 
                        independent source of "intelligence" outside the formal 
                        intelligence community. Lodged in the Pentagon's policy 
                        shop under Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith, the 
                        now-notorious Office of Special Plans "cherry-picked" 
                        raw intelligence, interviewed "defectors", and produced 
                        its own talking points and analysis that were 
                        "stovepiped" straight to Cheney's office, notably John 
                        Hannah, his top Mideast staffer, and I Lewis "Scooter" 
                        Libby, his powerful chief of staff. <p>When asked 
                        about this theory by a Georgetown student on Thursday, 
                        Tenet answered artfully, asserting: "I can tell you with 
                        certainty that the president of the United States gets 
                        his intelligence from one person and one community - me 
                        ... The rest of it, I don't know." <p>In the legal 
                        profession, Tenet's reply is called a negative pregnant, 
                        an apparent denial that suggests that further 
                        questioning may be fruitful. Indeed, Republican Jane 
                        Harmon, the ranking member of the House Intelligence 
                        Committee, noted in a CNN interview on Thursday evening 
                        that, in speaking of "one community", Tenet was 
                        effectively confirming that the Pentagon-Cheney channel, 
                        that provided a much more alarmist view of Saddam's 
                        capabilities, may well have been at work <p>But if 
                        Cheney felt displeased by Tenet's performance, things 
                        only got worse - much worse - later in the afternoon 
                        when United Press International (UPI) reported what has 
                        been rumored ever since Attorney General John Ashcroft 
                        recused himself from the investigation into the "outing" 
                        as a CIA officer by "two senior administration 
                        officials" of Valerie Plame, shortly after her husband, 
                        retired ambassador Joseph Wilson, had published an 
                        article in the New York Times charging that the 
                        administration knew that its reports of Saddam's alleged 
                        attempts to buy uranium yellowcake in Africa were bogus. 
                        <p>Quoting "federal law-enforcement officials," 
                        UPI's intelligence correspondent Richard Sale reported 
                        on Thursday that the two main suspects were none other 
                        than Libby and Hannah. One official reportedly told Sale 
                        that Hannah was being advised "that he faces a real 
                        possibility of doing jail time" in order to pressure him 
                        to implicate higher-ups - presumably Libby, if not, 
                        perhaps, Cheney himself. <p>A 1982 law makes 
                        deliberately revealing the identity of covert 
                        intelligence officers a felony punishable by as many as 
                        10 years in prison. If either Hannah or Libby were 
                        officially named as suspects or actually indicted, the 
                        impact on Cheney's credibility and electability would be 
                        devastating. <p>According to recent polls, Cheney's 
                        approval ratings, hovering around 20 percent, are 
                        already far below Bush's, which have themselves sunk 
                        below 50 percent for the first time in his presidency. 
                        Even Halliburton, whose public image has become so 
                        tarnished that it has launched a controversial 
                        television ad campaign to boost its image, last week 
                        listed Cheney's association to the company as a "risk 
                        factor" for its shareholders. <p>Republicans in 
                        Congress, particularly on the intelligence and foreign 
                        relations committees, find themselves having to devote 
                        more time and political capital to defending the vice 
                        president, and even some influential Republican donors 
                        have privately suggested that Cheney bow out. 
                        Speculation about possible replacements - most recently, 
                        former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani (the Republican 
                        convention is in New York City, August 30 to September 
                        2.) - is growing steadily. <p>Of course, there's always 
                        another day.
