<p>WATERVILLE -- Hostage negotiations in Iraq 

should be taken over by Muslim negotiators, 

said Terry Waite, one of the world's most 

famous names in hostage crises and 

humanitarian work.

Describing the 

unraveling security situation in Iraq as "a 

moral mess," Waite said Western leaders 

need to better understand the different strains 

of fundamentalism in the Islamic 

world.
<p>"Islam has provided a unifying base, 

but there are really two types of 

fundamentalists," Waite said during an 

interview with the Morning Sentinel. "There are 

those who are highly religiously and politically 

motivated. Now, you can relate to them. 


<p>"Then there are the psychopaths -- there's 

no talking to them. The problem with the 

present situation is that it provides an 

opportunity for the psychopaths to come 

out."
<p>In the pantheon of personalities in 

international crisis management, Waite 

carries a special weight. He already had a 

burnished reputation in hostage negotiations 

as the Archbishop of Canterbury's envoy when 

he was seized in 1987 by Islamic extremists 

while on a negotiating mission in Beirut, 

Lebanon.
<p>Held for nearly five years, four in 

solitary confinement, Waite was tortured and 

beaten. His story is powerful not only for his 

survival, but in publicly forgiving his captors 

when he returned to Beirut in 

February.
<p>Waite went into detail about that 

experience in his hourlong speech at Colby 

College, which ended in a standing ovation 

before a packed gallery. In that blow-by-blow 

account, he described how he went into 

negotiations alone and unarmed, and the 

importance of having truth on one's side.  


<p>"Truth is your final ally," he said. "When I 

was being interrogated, I could always stand 

on the truth, that I wasn't part of the 

Iran-Contra."
<p>Waite's abduction had been 

the result of extremists suspecting he was 

involved in the Iran-Contra scandal, a covert 


U.S. operation that traded arms with Iranians 

in exchange for hostages.  
<p>Since his 

release, Waite has devoted himself to 

humanitarian work. Among other missions, he 

has helped the homeless in Africa and street 

children in India and Colombia; and provided 

trauma counseling to children in Kosovo and 

the Middle East.
<p>That breadth of experience 

underlies a stinging indictment of the Bush 

administration's approach to Iraq. 
<p>"There's 

no question that Saddam Hussein is brutal 

and repressive," Waite said. "Having said that, 

if you remove the dictator, inevitably, 

repressed groups will spring up and fight 

each other. Very quickly, they will turn against 

whoever is seen as the invading force, whose 

motives are questioned across the Arab 

world."
<p>Waite believes that the spate of 

hostage-taking in Iraq -- of Americans, 

Chinese, and Japanese -- is the work of 

"splinter groups."
<p>It is a situation that can 

be broken by turning to those such as 

Abdulmajid Al-Zindani, he said. A prominent 

cleric in Yemen, Al-Zindani is thought by some 

to be a fundamentalist sheik, but has issued 

"fatwas" -- religious declarations -- calling for 

the release of hostages in Iraq.
<p>"They are 

the best people to deal with hostage 

negotiations," Waite said, "because the 

waters are so muddied by British and 

American involvement."
<p>Because of his 

extensive dealings with Muslim factions in the 

Middle East, and of his capture, Waite still 

enjoys tremendous access in that part of the 

world.
<p>Slamming the unilateral path to war 

taken by the Bush administration, Waite 

warned that U.S. detainees at Guantanamo 

Bay represent a failure in the war against 

terror.
<p>He drew parallels between 

hostage-taking and U.S. methods in 

Guantanamo Bay, pointing out that the 

detainees were taken on suspicion, not 

allowed due process, and initially were 

allowed no communication with their 

families.
<p>"You don't fight terrorism by 

adopting methods of terrorists," he said. 

"Guantanamo Bay is a victory for terrorists. 

The freedoms developed here were hard-won. 

We have at a stroke undermined those 

freedoms by detaining people this way. We're 

all eventually being robbed of those 

freedoms."
