<p>WASHINGTON  - Greenpeace accused President George W. Bush  of ignoring the risk of a terrorist attack on chemical plants because he has ties with that industry.
<p>&quot;The vulnerability of US chemical plants to terrorists is one of the most deadly threats we face,&quot; said Rick Hind, a Greenpeace spokesman.
<p>&quot;Instead of getting tough with the chemical industry, the Bush administration has treated them like the old friends they are.
<p>&quot;Bush has been AWOL in protecting Americans from a threat that is lurking in thousands of communities across the country,&quot; he told reporters.
<p>&quot;The Bush administration would rather listen to the Dow and Exxon lobbyists than take action to prevent a disaster.&quot;
<p>During the press conference, US consumer group Public Citizen presented a report that called for improved security regulations for chemical and nuclear plants, and blamed the Bush administration's ties with industry for the government's inaction.
<p>&quot;While focusing most of its efforts on aviation security and overseas wars, this administration has failed to take the steps necessary to protect the public from potentially catastrophic attacks on chemical plants, nuclear reactors, seaports, hazardous materials transport and water systems,&quot; said Public Citizen president Joan Claybrook.
<p>&quot;Prior to 9/11, these were highly vulnerable, high-impact targets -- and they still are today.
<p>&quot;Most corporations simply will not spend the money to secure the homeland unless the government creates standards and enforces those standards,&quot; she said.
<p>&quot;This administration, which has filled the top levels of government with corporate CEOs, lobbyists and lawyers, simply does not want to regulate business -- even when the safety and security of Americans is at stake.&quot;
