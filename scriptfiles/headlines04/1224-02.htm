<p>FALLUJA, Iraq - Iraqis reacted with anger,
frustration and resentment Friday after many returned to
Falluja to discover their homes in rubble and their livelihoods
ruined following last month's U.S. offensive.

<p>"I saw the city and al-Andalus destroyed," said Ali
Mahmood, 35, referring to the district of the city he returned
to briefly Thursday but now plans to leave after seeing the
mess.
<p>"My house is completely destroyed. There is nothing left
for me to stay for," the teacher said, adding that he would
rather live in the tented camp outside Falluja that has been
his family's home for the past two months.

Some 2,000 Iraqis, who fled a U.S.-led offensive on Falluja more than a month ago, are returning to the Sunni Muslim city although sporadic fighting persists in some areas, Iraqi ministers said.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, on a suprise
pre-Christmas visit to Iraq, visited troops at a base near
Falluja Friday but made no mention of the city's rebuilding.
<p>Marine Lieutenant General John Sattler told Rumsfeld how
intense the fighting had been in the city, where much of the
combat was house-to-house and even hand-to-hand.
<p>"You come through the door and it's who wants it most, and
it was us," Sattler said, praising the resolve of his men.
<p>Conservative estimates say several hundred buildings were
partly or completely destroyed by the U.S. assault, which began
on Nov. 8 and involved bombardment by U.S. planes, tanks and
artillery. Rebels also blew up many homes in booby-trap blasts.
<p>The offensive, designed to uproot insurgents from what had
become a guerrilla bastion, was declared a success more than a
month ago, but fighting continued in several districts. U.S.
planes bombed a western neighborhood overnight, residents said.
<p>An Iraqi Health Ministry official said his greatest concern
was the resentment Falluja's people were likely to feel when
they saw how much damage had been done to their homes.
<p>That was certainly the case Friday. While those who fled
were at pains to say they had nothing to do with the rebels who
made Falluja their stronghold, many of them have since become
angry and militant as a result of the offensive.
<p>"Would Allah want us to return to a city that animals can't
live in?" said Yasser Satar as he saw his destroyed home.
<p>"Even animals who have no human sense and feelings can not
live here," he said, crying.
<p>"What do they want from Falluja? This is the crime of the
century. They want to destroy Islam and Muslims. But our anger
and resistance will increase."
<p>
NO WATER, ELECTRICITY
<p>Aid workers said 200,000 people fled Falluja before the
assault and have spent the past seven weeks living in nearby
towns and villages or in tented refugee camps nearby.
<p>The city was estimated to have had a population of around
250,000 before the offensive. It is not clear how many people
stayed behind during the fighting, although it is thought to
have been around 50,000, mostly in outlying areas. Most central
areas became a ghost town.
<p>The Iraqi interim government and the U.S. military this
week announced that around 2,000 heads of household would be
allowed to return to the Andalus district of Falluja,
considered one of the more secure, from Thursday.
<p>Some 900 people, mostly men, made the journey, going
through intense security checks before being allowed to enter,
including fingerprinting and iris scanning of "suspicious
military-age men" to ensure insurgents do not filter back in.
<p>The U.S. military said the program to return residents had
gone well Thursday and it expected more people to flow back
into the Andalus district in the days ahead. In the coming
weeks, others will be allowed to return to their neighborhoods.
<p>But they will be without water and electricity as basic
services and communications were knocked out in the assault.
<p>Iraq's government has said it will pay &#36;2,000 compensation
for partial damage to homes, &#36;4,000 for substantial damage and
&#36;10,000 to those whose homes were completely destroyed -- far
less than Iraqis say they would need to rebuild their homes.
<p>Shopkeepers will receive &#36;1,500-&#36;3,000 based on the size of
their shop and what they sell. But that may not be enough to
assuage the anger of many. Asked Satar: "Is this freedom and
democracy that they brought to Falluja?"
