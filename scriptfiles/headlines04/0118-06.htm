<p>LONDON - Police in London probing the death of British peace activist Tom Hurndall, who died after being shot in the head in the Gaza Strip, refused to be drawn on a report that Israel had prevented them from conducting inquiries.
<p>"On behalf of the coroner, we've been asked to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death," a Scotland Yard spokeswoman told AFP, referring to the shooting of Tom Hurndall in April 2003.
<p>Hurndall was a volunteer with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a group of pro-Palestinian activists who engage in non-violent action to protect civilians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
<p>"We will be seeking cooperation with the Israeli authorities to assist us with the investigation," she said, but refused to comment on a British newspaper report that Israel was blocking the probe.
<p>Hurndall, 22, was hit in the head and critically wounded by sniper fire in the Rafah refugee camp on April 11 and was subsequently pronounced clinically dead.
<p>The Daily Telegraph said on Saturday that Israel, whose police have conducted their own inquiries and arrested a soldier, had refused to allow British detectives to be part of the investigation into his death.
<p>"No one will be allowed to interfere in the course of Israeli justice," Shuli Davidovitch, Israel's spokesman in Britain, was quoted as saying by the Daily Telegraph.
<p>"There has been a thorough and independent investigation into the shooting and charges have been brought," Davidovitch told the paper.
<p>An Israeli soldier has been indicted on six charges, including one of assault.
<p>The unnamed soldier initially said he had returned fire at a man armed with a pistol but under interrogation admitted firing a shot near an unarmed civilian, according to the Israeli army.
<p>Hurndall's parents welcomed the news on Friday that Britain had instigated an independent investigation into their son's death and expressed doubts about the validity of the inquiries conducted by the Israeli authorities.
<p>"There is no question in our minds that this was a shot intended to kill," Hurndall's mother Jocelyn told BBC radio.
<p>"The key issue is that there is a culture of impunity within the Israeli defence force," she said.
<p>Several ISM activists have been wounded by the Israeli army in the course of the intifada, or Palestinian uprising.
<p>An army investigation into the death of 23-year-old US national and ISM activist Rachel Corrie concluded that when she was crushed to death by an Israeli bulldozer in Rafah in March it had been an accident.
<p>The Israeli army said it would not take any disciplinary action against the soldiers involved.
<p>Corrie had been trying to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian house.
