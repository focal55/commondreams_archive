Union leaders, academics and community activists plan to hold an unusual meeting in Washington today to begin mapping out a strategy to check  Wal-Mart's growing power and to press the company to improve its wages and benefits.</p>

<p>The meeting was organized largely because union leaders fear that Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest company, is pushing down wages and benefits, not just among retailers but throughout the economy.</p>

<p>Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, convened the meeting, which will bring together union leaders, professors who have studied Wal-Mart and leaders of Acorn and other community groups. Organizers also said that Barbara Ehrenreich, the author of "Nickel and Dimed," an account of making a living as a blue-collar worker, would attend.</p>

<p>The meeting, several participants said, will not focus on developing strategies to unionize Wal-Mart but rather on assessing Wal-Mart's influence on the nation and on strategies to check Wal-Mart's downward pull on wages.</p>

<p>Mr. Stern has begun a blog that seeks to stimulate a conversation not just within labor, but among many groups, about Wal-Mart, which has more than 3,500 stores and 1.2 million employees nationwide. </p>

<p>In his blog, Mr. Stern wrote, "Wal-Mart provides a chilling example of the damage that low-wage, nonunion corporations can wreak, and their business model is going to set the standards for our children unless we do something now.'' </p>

<p>He added, "Wal-Mart is the sewer pipe through which good jobs are being flushed."</p>

<p>Sarah Clark, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company knew little about the meeting. "We believe that we pay good and fair wages and offer a comprehensive benefit package,'' she said. "There are numerous groups who do not want us to succeed for their own reasons."</p>

<p>Ms. Clark said Wal-Mart's full-time hourly workers averaged $9.64 an hour, or $18,046 a year. She added that Wal-Mart's critics often ignored that the company contributes to employee 401(k) plans and promotes more than 9,000 hourly workers each year into management.</p>

<p>She said that while critics say 40 percent of Wal-Mart's workers do not have company health insurance, 90 percent of its employees have health benefits through some plan - perhaps a spouse's or through state Medicaid.</p>

<p>Many union officials have complained that the United Food and Commercial Workers, the union with jurisdiction to unionize Wal-Mart, has done too little to try to organize the retailer and has been highly unsuccessful in those efforts.</p>

<p>"Wal-Mart has been very difficult,'' said Joe Hansen, president of the food and commercial workers union. "It's the largest corporation in the world. They fly in this task force that terrorizes the workers the minute anyone talks about unions."</p>

<p>Wal-Mart officials say the company is not antiunion and lets workers decide freely whether they want a union.</p>

<p> Labor's concerns about Wal-Mart have grown after the four-and-a-half-month labor dispute in which Southern California's three largest supermarket chains won the right to cut wages and benefits for new workers. Supermarket executives asserted that they needed to reduce pay to compete with Wal-Mart as it expanded in California.</p>

<p>One idea that will be under consideration at the meeting, several participants said, is to issue a set of principles, like the Sullivan principles for South Africa, that Wal-Mart would be urged to follow regarding wages and treatment of its workers.</p>

<p>"My sense is they view this as a decade-long struggle,'' said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who organized a conference last month on Wal-Mart and will be attending the meeting.</p>

<p>John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, has recommended that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. focus on just two things after the November elections: politics and finding ways to press Wal-Mart to improve wages and benefits. Several A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials are expected to attend the Washington meeting.</p>

<p>"Wal-Mart is the largest employer in the U.S.,'' Mr. Wilhelm said. "It's incredibly pervasive in its race-to-the-bottom influence.''</p>
