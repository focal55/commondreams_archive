<p>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan --
Now that the military has pulled back from the tribal areas near 
the Afghan border after a battle that left more than 100 people dead, 
Pakistani authorities are hailing the operation as a success and vowing to 
continue their pursuit of al Qaeda and Taliban fugitives on Pakistani 
territory, but many doubt the government's upbeat assessment.
<P>"Certainly some objectives, like disrupting a terrorist haven, have been 
achieved, but overall it's a bit bold to characterize the undertaking as a 
success," said Islamabad-based defense analyst Mohammad Bokhari.
<P>Others were more blunt in their assessments.
<P>"It was a first-rate fiasco," said Pakistani political columnist Ayaz 
Amir. "Instead of a 'shock and awe' campaign with the climax of a high-profile 
arrest that authorities kept hinting at, the government ended up embarrassed 
and cowed."

Paramilitary soldiers moved in to surround the house of a local tribesman 
believed to be sheltering foreign fugitives March 18. By the day's end, 15 
soldiers were dead, and another 10 had been taken prisoner. As the military 
rushed reinforcements into the area, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 
unleashed a storm of speculation by stating his belief that 400 to 500 
fighters were protecting a "high-value target," and attention quickly focused 
on al Qaeda's No. 2 man, Ayman al-Zawahri. Military officials vowed that no 
one would escape.
<P>But four days later, military officials reluctantly conceded that many of 
their prey might have escaped through a complex of tunnels discovered by 
military personnel. What began with a boom ended in a whimper as Pakistani 
officials spent the next week laying the groundwork for a withdrawal.
<P>"Musharraf blew it," says Michael O'Hanlon, a military affairs expert at 
the Brooking Institution in Washington. "(He) did his commanders no favors by 
raising expectations that Zawahri was cornered."
<P>"If (the operation) did nothing more than kill a few militants, then it 
was certainly not a success," he continued. "But if diplomacy with the tribal 
leaders led to a new attitude about providing sanctuary to militants and 
foreign fighters, then perhaps it could be called a success."
<P>Pakistan's tribal agencies have enjoyed broad autonomy since the country 
was created in 1947. It was the impoverished Pashtun tribesmen from these 
areas who stepped forward to help fight against the Soviet occupation in 
neighboring Afghanistan, and from their ranks emerged the Taliban.
<P>Last year, after several rounds of negotiations, the Pakistani army 
entered the tribal areas for the first time to seal off the border and prevent 
any terrorist attacks from originating there. In exchange, tribesmen received 
guarantees of development projects, including roads, schools and hospitals.
<P>But the autonomous territories, including South Waziristan, where the 
latest battle erupted, continue to serve as a refuge for Taliban and other 
Islamic militants, as well as drug lords and arms traders.
<P>Indeed, the presence of foreigners in the tribal areas along the Afghan 
border was not a shock to government officials, who now admit they knew that 
large numbers of militants had been operating for months in villages just 10 
miles from a major Pakistani military base.
<P>"These men were leftovers from the Afghan jihad with nowhere to go," said 
Amir. "Many of them married into the local community and were known elements. 
If they were al Qaeda supporters or (Osama) bin Laden loyalists, then why 
didn't the government act against them before?"
<P>Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed conceded last week that the 
government had been soft on the militants.
<P>"We admit that we started this operation late," he told journalists. "We 
kept showing them hospitality and offering them amnesty, and they kept 
strengthening their positions."
<P>But that changed as the government reacted to two assassination attempts 
on Musharraf in December and, some say, growing pressure from the Bush 
administration to crack down on militants. 
<P>In a briefing for journalists Monday, military spokesman Maj. Gen. 

Shaukat Sultan laid out the South Waziristan operation's achievements, 
including the death of 63 militants, the demolition of 50 houses believed to 
have been used by militants, the seizure of weapons and bomb-making components 
and the detention of 167 suspects - 94 local tribesmen and 73 foreigners.
<P>But it has come at a high cost.
<P>"This operation reeks of American pressure and indifference to our 
domestic concerns," said defense analyst Bokhari. "Going in guns blazing and 
costing civilian lives does nothing more than enrage Pakistani people and 
weaken our society. Where was the planning? What was the strategy? We still 
have no answers."
<P>As the operation played out, Musharraf was under increasing pressure from 
across the political spectrum for failing to take political parties into 
confidence before launching the operation. While most Pakistanis support the 
war on terror, the deaths of more than a dozen civilians, the destruction of 
homes and the pervasive feeling that Islamabad was merely doing Washington's 
bidding led to mounting anger on the Pakistani street.
<P>"We've done enough service to America," Amir said, referring both to 
Pakistan's Cold War alliance with the United States and its help in the war on 
terror. "Our national interests should come first, and anti-terror operations 
should be conducted with that in mind."
<P>It is a delicate balancing act, and many observers say Musharraf is 
increasingly trapped between the demands of the United States and those of his 
own citizens.
<P>"The U.S. position is that after what happened in Afghanistan, we really 
cannot tolerate a no man's land where terrorism can fester,'' said Vali Nasr, 
professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in 
Monterey, adding that South Waziristan might be the last place as lawless as 
Afghanistan used to be.
<P>"Either it has to police itself, or somebody has to police it,'' he said. 
"But Pakistan is unwilling to talk about pacifying South Waziristan because it 
would have to brace itself for a mini civil war." 
<P>Faced with such choices, observers say, Musharraf has failed to strike 
the delicate balance necessary to satisfy both international and domestic 
demands.
<P>"There needs to be a clearly defined strategy that we have not seen 
articulated yet," said retired Pakistani Lt. Gen. Talat Massood. "Right now, 
all most Pakistanis see is that this was done to help Musharraf's 
international reputation and George Bush's re-election campaign, not to help 
us be rid of a scourge that plagues our society."
