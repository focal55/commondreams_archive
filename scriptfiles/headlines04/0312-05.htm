<p>LONDON  - Children abducted or recruited to fight
in wars suffer horrific atrocities and many are beaten and
sexually abused, Belgian researchers said on Friday.
<p>
 Young soldiers are forced to kill other children or even
members of their own family, and girls are given to senior
staff to act as wives.

<!--/endimage/-->"I think this is the first time someone has investigated
their experiences," Ilse Derluyn, of Ghent University in
Belgium, told Reuters.
<p>
 An estimated 300,000 children, some 12 or younger, are
currently serving as soldiers or guerrilla fighters in
conflicts around the globe.
<p>
 Derluyn and her colleagues interviewed 301 former child
soldiers who had been abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA), a rebel movement in northern Uganda. Their research is
published in The Lancet medical journal.
<p>
 Most of the children she spoke to had been soldiers for
more than two years. The abduction of children is the main
method of recruitment of the LRA.
<p>
 Half had been seriously beaten, nearly 40 percent had
killed someone or had abducted other children, 77 percent saw
someone being killed and 35 percent of the girls had been
sexually abused.
<p>
 Six percent of the child soldiers witnessed the murder of
their own father, brother or another relative. Nearly 40
percent had killed someone and two percent were forced to kill
a family member.
 <p>
 One former Ugandan girl soldier who had been abducted in
1996 described how she was forced to murder a boy who had tried
to escape.
 <p>
 "He was recaptured and I had to kill him, by beating him to
death with sticks," she said.
 <p>
 The girl admitted looting villages, abducting other
children and said she gave birth to a son fathered by an army
commander and later had to abandon the baby.
 <p>
 "I don't know what happened to him," she told Derluyn.
 <p>
 Most of the children suffered from post-traumatic stress,
but Derluyn said they showed remarkable resilience.
 <p>
 "They try to pick up their lives as much as possible," she
said.
 <p>
 In an editorial, The Lancet questioned what the
international community is doing to improve the future of child
soldiers and called for the United Nations  to draw up an action
plan.
 <p>
 "For the rest of the world to look the other way while each
night children hide from warlords is a terrible indictment of
21st century priorities," the magazine said.</p>
