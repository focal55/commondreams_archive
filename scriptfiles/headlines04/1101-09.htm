      <p>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay  - 

The left made more inroads
into Latin America in four elections this weekend as
crisis-weary voters tired of decades of U.S-backed market
reforms warmed to pragmatic platforms of economic growth with
better distribution of wealth.

  <p>
 Tiny Uruguay became the latest South American nation to
elect a leftist leader in a historic shift while the left
notched up victories in local elections that could set the tone
for future presidential votes in Brazil, Chile and Venezuela.

Tabare Vazquez, who will be Uruguay's first leftist leader,
won the presidency in his third attempt after toning down some
earlier fiery left-wing proposals and choosing Danilo Astori,
well-regarded in Wall Street, as economy minister.
 <p>
 Uruguay joins the dominant club of South American nations
-- Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Venezuela -- governed by
leftists or center-leftists who are putting up trade and
diplomatic challenges to the United States in its traditional
"backyard."
 <p>
 In the last decade, free market policies opening up the
countries to foreign investment often ended in economic
disaster, particularly in Argentina and Uruguay, once rich
farming nations where millions now do not have enough to eat.
 <p>
 But many of these nations, all growing at a healthy clip
these days, cannot afford to abandon fiscal austerity and lose
investor confidence. Their debt burdens are too big and their
economies depend heavily on foreign investment.
 <p>

 Vazquez says Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
is his main inspiration. Analysts say Lula's leftist pragmatism
-- combining fiscally austere policies with efforts to improve
social welfare -- is winning adepts around the region.
 <p>
 "South America's democracies are maturing and becoming more
similar," political analyst David Fleischer at the University
of Brasilia said. "It means South Americans might have a more
unified position in areas like trade talks with the United
States."
 <p>
 BRAZIL, CHILE EYE PRESIDENTIAL VOTES
 <p>
 Two years after Lula swept to power, his Workers Party lost
three big cities in municipal elections on Sunday, including
the financial and industrial hub Sao Paulo. But setbacks for
the PT were blamed on local issues rather than on Lula.
 <p>
 Workers Party candidates did well overall in the elections
for nearly 5,600 municipalities, expanding the party's presence
beyond its traditional strongholds two years before the 2006
presidential election.
 <p>
 Chile also had a litmus test for its 2005 presidential race
with Sunday's mayoral elections. President Ricardo Lagos'
center-left coalition, which has ruled Chile for 15 years, took
45 percent of votes and the right-wing opposition got 39
percent.
 <p>
 Political scientists said the victory, although it was by a
narrower margin than the last three mayoral races, was good
news for the ruling coalition.
 <p>

 "The president, who seemed at the point of becoming a lame
duck, is flying, flying very high," said Patricio Navia, a
political scientist with New York University.
 <p>
 In Venezuela, preliminary results showed candidates loyal
to leftist President Hugo Chavez sweeping at least 18 of 23
state governorships and winning the influential Caracas mayor's
post.
 <p>
 Chavez, a firebrand populist first elected in 1998, has
vowed to strengthen his social reforms after ousting opposition
governors and mayors whom he accuses of backing a brief 2002
coup against him.
 <p>
 It was a crushing defeat for an opposition demoralized by
the president's victory in an August referendum.

<p>
 "The reality for at least the next two years is that
President Chavez is gaining more political power," said Jose
Cerritelli, an analyst with Bear Stearns in New York.
<p>
Encouraged by his win and others for the left in the
region, Chavez proclaimed on Monday "the revolution is here to
stay," and that "Latin America's great people are rising up."
