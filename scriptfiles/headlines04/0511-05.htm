<p>Americans say they're disgusted and embarrassed by the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at the hands of grinning U.S. troops. The soldiers' behavior at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison, captured so vividly in photographs, is inexcusable to an overwhelming majority of the public.</div>

So offensive is the scandal that it appears to be having a profound impact on public opinion about the war. For the first time, a majority of Americans say they're dissatisfied with President Bush's performance, and 58% disapprove of his handling of the situation in Iraq, according to a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday. </p>
<p>The poll finds war opposition growing since news of the prisoner abuse broke 12 days ago: More than half of Americans &#8212; 54% vs. 47% just a week ago &#8212; now say going to war was "not worth it." But 54% say it wasn't a mistake to send troops in the first place. Polling experts explain the difference this way: Americans are often reluctant to call something a mistake when U.S. troops are involved.</p>
<p>Regardless, nearly half &#8212; 48% &#8212; consider the news about the prison incidents a major setback to the U.S. mission in Iraq.</p>
<p>Prisoner abuse could become a pivotal event in turning public opinion against the war just as the disastrous 1968 Tet offensive galvanized Americans against the Vietnam War. Nearly half of those polled &#8212; 47% &#8212; think the United States should withdraw some or all of its troops from Iraq, up 10 percentage points since mid-April.</p>
<p>"This war was already wobbling in a state of ambiguity, and I think these photos and this incident really were a tipping-point moment," says Orville Schell, dean of the journalism school at the University of California-Berkeley.</p>
<p>Americans clearly abhor the prison images: 79% say they're bothered by the abuse, 71% consider the incidents serious offenses, 79% say they violated policy and 73% see no circumstances under which such conduct is justified. More than 8 in 10 believe U.S. soldiers have higher standards of behavior than soldiers from other countries.</p>
<p>Still, most think the abuses were isolated instances of soldiers acting on their own. While 83% say the soldiers who carried out the abuse are most to blame, 42% assign at least some responsibility to President Bush. But only 29% think he should fire Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>In interviews across the nation &#8212; from affluent La Jolla, Calif., to an Arab-American enclave in Paterson, N.J. &#8212; people say they're appalled by images of troops gloating over naked Iraqi POWs.</p>
<p>"People our age are going over there and dying, being put in awful situations, because we have an awful president who put them there," says Milie Joshi, 19, a sophomore women's studies major at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. But her friend, Gigi Tucker, 19, a French major, says troops "get carried away" in war zones. "In a situation where you've been sent to kill people, stuff happens," she says.</p>
<p><b>A string of bad news</b></p>
<p>The poll comes at the end of a rough week at the White House. April was the deadliest month yet for American troops in Iraq. War costs are soaring by tens of billions of dollars. The administration still isn't sure who'll take power in Baghdad after the June 30 U.S. handover. And more photos and video footage of prisoner abuse are expected to become public.</p>
<p>Some see that as a glass half full. "This will be a short story unless there's some sort of cover-up," says Peter Brookes, a senior fellow for national security affairs at the Heritage Foundation. "If you step back, there's been tremendous progress. Most Iraqis are going on with their lives. The country is not up in flames."</p>
<p>John Cimino, 48, an unemployed Navy veteran in Colorado Springs, agrees that the incidents were a "bump in the road" and spoke for many when he said: "There will always be a small group of individuals that will bypass the chain of command."</p>
<p>The images are jarring to Army Sgt. Jason Rogers, an Arabic-speaking interpreter who dealt with both civilians and combatants during his year of duty in Iraq. </p>
<p>"I left Iraq feeling I had witnessed the most professional and compassionate army," says Rogers, 28, of Detroit. "I never saw anything like this. Nothing but professionalism." </p>
<p>He acknowledges that it will be harder now for Iraqis "to give their hearts and minds" to their American liberators. "Saddam was a monster. The Iraqi people are not unaccustomed to abuse," adds Rogers, who is due to leave the Army in another month. "But to hear it done by Americans ... it breaks my heart."</p>
<p>Two Navy veterans scuba diving in the Pacific Ocean near San Diego also have misgivings.</p>
<p>"I'm a former troop myself. But if I were a prisoner, I sure wouldn't want to be treated like that," says Gil Miranda, 33, of nearby La Jolla. Miranda and friend Dave Sekhon say that if soldiers were ordered to mistreat prisoners, refusing to comply would have been difficult, but not impossible.</p>
<p>"The worst thing you can do to morale is to go against the chain of command," says Sekhon, 28, of Oceanside, Calif. "You do have the right to question, and in this situation, there should have been questions asked."</p>
<p><b>Debating the next step</b></p>
<p>While some say the prison photos have hardened their opposition to the war, others are wary of a pullout. "It would be very damaging to the U.S. internationally to pull out immediately," says Vietnam-born Thanh Nguyen, 33, a graduate student in finance at Vanderbilt. "They need to correct what's been done before they pull out, as opposed to sending the troops home and almost admitting a mistake or failure to accomplish anything."</p>
<p>But Mary Lou Locke, 54, who teaches history at a community college outside San Diego, is more troubled by the prison incidents than by atrocities in the Vietnam War "because at least what happened in Vietnam was in the heat of battle. What's even more appalling is that I can tell the administration didn't take it seriously until it became public." </p>
<p>Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, says the military's image could suffer. "Whatever people's attitudes toward the war had been, they had a very favorable attitude toward U.S. troops," he says. "And this comes as a shock."</p>
<p>In interviews, some insist that the U.S. soldiers' behavior paled next to Saddam Hussein's treatment of his own prisoners or the killings of four American contractors by Iraqi insurgents.</p>
<p>Jeanie Walker, 20, a sales clerk in a boutique in Colorado Springs, near the Army's sprawling Fort Carson, says the abuse is disgraceful but "it blows my mind" that grisly images of a mob killing the four Americans in Fallujah March 31 didn't get the same explicit airing in the media.</p>
<p>"If we're going to show our soldiers pointing guns at naked men, why not show what they've done to us?" Walker says. "I went on the Internet and saw the pictures (of the Fallujah mob), cutting our men, limb from limb, for no reason. You don't see that on Fox or CNN."</p>
<p>But most Americans "don't judge ourselves on the same basis of what Saddam does," Kohut says. "No American would say, 'Well, look what he did,' because we're different."</p>
<p>The prison abuse is the talk of Paterson, the nation's second-largest Arab-American community. "Saddam Hussein was bad and the Americans are just as bad &#8212; that's the consensus of the neighborhood," says Abraham Halaad, 58. A Turkish-American and U.S. Army veteran, he disagrees: the United States should stay the course.</p>
<p>But many of Paterson's 20,000 Arab-Americans want the United States to withdraw. "We were there to get Saddam," says Chad Hato, 32, who was raised in Jordan. "Saddam's gone. Leave them alone. Let them do democracy their way."</p>
<p>Hani Awadallah, of Clifton, N.J., a chemistry professor at Montclair State University and president of the Arab American Civic Organization, says the scandal reinforces his perception of U.S. action in Iraq "as an illegal war against the will of the international community."</p>
<p>"I love this country," says Awadallah, who was born in Jerusalem and has been in the USA for 37 years. "No question about it. But we are very misguided." </p>
<p><b>Fallout in the Middle East</b></p>
<p>How the scandal will resonate in the Middle East worries some. "That's going to make us have more enemies," says Ray Odeh, 30, a Palestinian-American beautician in Paterson. "A lot of people believe we've done bad things. I don't believe that. I think we've done a lot of good. But when pictures like these are shown all over the world, it makes it seem that we are only a selfish people and only care about our own interests."</p>
<p>Kohut says Pew's international polls find many Arabs who believe that suicide attacks against Americans are justified. The prisoner abuse, he says, "just fuels that kind of anger." </p>
<p>Some experts now believe public opinion could favor turning Iraq reconstruction over to NATO or the United Nations. </p>
<p>"More people will begin to ask, 'Why doesn't somebody else run this?' " says Robert Blendon, a professor of political analysis at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. </p>
<p>Blendon doubts that the abuse itself will tip public opinion against the war, but it could spark an Iraqi backlash that would tip the scales. "What could do it are huge marches, chants of 'Americans go home,' burning Bush in effigy, Iraqis throwing gas bombs at Humvees," he says. "If it looks like a popular response instead of like a small terrorist group."</p>
<p>Public opinion about the war could hinge on how the administration handles the crisis. "The cover-up is always worse than the crime, and if the president is found to be misleading or if this policy went higher than the administration now suggests, the effects could be much more far-reaching," says Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a media think tank.</p>
<p>"On the spectrum of Bush's supporters are some people who think this kind of stuff happens, that it's no big deal," Rosenstiel says. "But I think that's a minority of Americans."</p>
<p>Media experts think the impact of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse would have been far less without the photos. Even Secretary of State Colin Powell drew a parallel with Vietnam War images, particularly the 1968 massacre of My Lai villagers by U.S. troops.</p>
<p>"When you think back to the photos of My Lai, certain photos that came out of World War II, there tend to be moments that are just galvanized and frozen by still photography," Schell says.</p>
<p>Blendon says Russian dictator Josef Stalin was a mass murderer every bit as heinous as Adolf Hitler, but his crimes never horrified the public the way Hitler's gas chambers did. The reason is that many photos were published of German concentration camps but none of Stalin's gulags. </p>
<p>But the Iraqi prison photos are almost overkill for some. </p>
<p>"I don't want to listen to it anymore," says Rich Christian, 35, a firefighter in Fountain, Colo., who supports the war. "I want to hear the good news, too. Everybody's trying to spin the bad stuff."</p>
