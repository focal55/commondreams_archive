<p>STOCKHOLM - U.S. accounts have portrayed Saddam's capture as 
a triumph of their high-tech innovation and old-fashioned ingenuity, but reports 
in the Middle East and off-the-record interviews reveal a version of events 
decidedly different from those already known.
</b>
<p>Since the announcement of Saddam Hussein's capture by the United States 
Dec. 14, conflicting accounts of events have been heralded as truth, first by the 
United States, then by the Kurds. But as often, the truth seems to lie somewhere 
in between, and contains some unheralded facts.
<p>
   Foremost among those unsung facts is the capture by the U.S. 4th Army of a 
member of the al Muslit family -- trusted relatives and lieutenants of Saddam -- 
by U.S. forces in July. This spawned a fateful chain of events leading to the 
former dictator's reported betrayal and drugging in a plan reportedly inspired by 
the United States and pursued by his betrayer.
<p>
   But while Kurds from the Iraq-based Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were 
said to be acting as go-betweens with U.S. authorities, they pursued a triumph 
of their own and essentially snatched control of Saddam from the hands of his 
captors. This they did with suspected Iranian related support.
<p>
   The critical arrest in July was that of Adnan Abdullah Abid al Muslit, widely 
known to be one of Saddam Hussein's closest bodyguards and collaborators.
<p>
   Just a week prior to the July arrest, the respected German daily Suddeutsche 
Zeitung (SD) had reported that U.S. forces believed Saddam was traveling with 
a group of three men. The surname al Muslit first surfaced then. 
<p>
   SD mentioned Khalil Ibrahim Omar al Muslit as the name of Saddam's driver. It 
said his brothers were the other two bodyguards with Saddam. And so the 
capture of Adnan Abdullah Abid al Muslit became an apparent key to future 
events. 
<p>
   Those events were first reported Dec. 18. The Jordanian newspaper Al-Arab 
Al-Yawm said that Mohammed Ibrahim Omar al Muslit -- one of Saddam's 
bodyguards -- had drugged the former dictator and given information to U.S. 
forces leading to Saddam's capture. 
<p>
   The significance of the report went virtually unnoticed.  But the fact of 
"pressure" on captives and their families has been widely reported. 
<p>
  The Al-Arab article said Mohammed Ibrahim Omar al Muslit contacted the U.S. 
forces through a relative. The drugging plan was described as a U.S. inspired 
outgrowth of this. Kurdish sources have been reported as acknowledging that 
Saddam's own people were key to their having him.
<p>
   Several recent reports have suggested that the Kurds caught Saddam, but 
questions remained over just how they managed to "get him".  
<p>
   A Kurdish presence had been reported in Tikrit area where Saddam was 
arrested. A member of the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) was quoted in The 
Guardian newspaper of Britain as confirming that presence.
<p>
   This Kurdish presence materialized about two to three weeks before 
Saddam's capture, about the time he was reportedly drugged by al Muslit. Muslit 
seems to have captured Saddam some time after mid-November, intelligence 
sources indicate. 
<p>
   Kurdish sources named the leader of this Kurdish group of about 50 as Kosrat 
Rassul, head of the PUK intelligence unit that was instrumental in the operation. 
Rassul is also deputy to Jalal Talabani, member of the IGC, and PUK head. 
<p>
   News of Saddam's arrest was first released by the Iranian News Agency 
(IRNA). Several accounts agree that the information was given to them by 
Talabani.
<p>
   Separately, an independent footnote to the Iranian media coverage was 
provided in the reported remarks of an Iraqi resistance leader, illustrating 
another thread running through the story. 
<p>
   Asked to comment on Saddam's capture, the resistance leader Jabbar al 
Kubaysi was quoted as saying: "Without the help of Iranian intelligence the 
arrest would not have been possible." Iranian foreign ministry spokesman 
Hamid-Reza Asefi denied the Islamic Republic's involvement. But for many, 
questions remain. 
<p>
   Rassul is reported to have developed contacts with some of the key leaders in 
Tikrit area, placing himself in a position to negotiate with them. A drugged 
Saddam was the object.
<p>
   Notably, it was Rassul who had arrested former Iraqi vice-president Taha 
Yassin 
Ramadan. The PUK was also reported to have been instrumental in locating 
Saddam's sons Uday and Qusay.
<p>
   The Sunday Express published in London Dec. 21 reported that Kurdish 
forces had held Saddam for an indefinite period. 
<p>
   Quoting an unnamed senior British intelligence officer, the Sunday Express 
report says Saddam -- on whose head the United States had placed a 25 million 
dollar bounty -- was then held captive by the PUK, which bargained with the 
United States before arranging to hand over the drugged dictator. 
<p>
   The Express article said that Saddam was not captured "as a result of any 
American or British intelligence." 
<p>
   But earlier, almost simultaneous with U.S. news of Saddam's taking Dec. 14, a 
report by a group said to have close links to Israeli intelligence surfaced. 
<p>
   This group, DEBKAfile, has a considerable reputation for occasionally 
revealing accurate facts. But DEBKA's information has also sometimes proven 
inaccurate, giving rise to conjecture that their reporting occasionally mixes in 
"facts" the Israeli intelligence community wishes to publicize.
<p>
   Within a few hours of the announcement of the capture, DEBKA put out a 
report that Saddam had been held for two weeks or more. The scenario it 
painted went on to reconcile several of the capture accounts, particularly the 
connection between Kurds and the captors. 
<p>
   DEBKA said Saddam's own people initiated action against him some time 
after mid-November. It said Kurds from the PUK were acting as negotiators with 
them on behalf of the United States, with the reward being an issue for 
Saddam's captors. Credit for the Kurds followed. 
<p>
   At the same time another group, conceivably an Iranian affiliated group, could 
have sought intelligence on Saddam's location and provided support, according 
to diplomatic and intelligence sources. It is also believed that this option 
provided a way to "short-cut" the negotiating process, allowing Saddam to be 
taken directly. 
<p>
   Iranian interest in bringing Saddam to justice is widely acknowledged, and 
Talabani's PUK was known to possess good links with Iran and its intelligence 
apparatus.</p>
