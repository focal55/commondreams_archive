<p>UNITED NATIONS - Trygve Lie of Norway, the first U.N. 
secretary-general, described his job as ''the most impossible on earth.''
</b>
					  <p>

					  
					  
As chief administrative officer of the 191-member United Nations, the 
secretary-general also holds one of the most diplomatically sensitive posts 
in the world. The conventional wisdom is that he is not expected to play 
politics -- or interfere in the internal affairs of any member state.
<p>


But still, if the secretary-general is to be more of a ''general'' than a 
''secretary,'' according to many U.N. watchers, he has the legitimate right 
to express his views -- however unpalatable to some -- in his capacity as 
head of a supreme world political body.
<p>

The thin line of distinction has often been blurred. But one of the skills 
of a competent secretary-general is to diplomatically walk that delicate 
line without making political enemies.
<p>

The present incumbent, Kofi Annan of Ghana, has been politically crucified 
in recent weeks because of some recent statements -- specifically about the 
war on Iraq -- that seem unacceptable to the administration of U.S. 
President George W Bush.
<p>

In September, Annan declared that the U.S.-led military invasion of Iraq in 
March 2003 was ''illegal'' and violated the U.N. Charter, provoking 
criticism from the White House and from U.S. politicians.
<p>

”U.N. Chief Ignites Firestorm by calling Iraq War 'Illegal',” is how the 
'New York Times' described the controversy.
<p>

U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas said: ”Kofi Annan and those on the 
campaign trail who share this view must explain the inconvenient fact that 
if they had their way, Saddam (Hussein) would be in power (in Iraq), mass 
graves would still be growing in size, and tens of millions of newly 
liberated people would still be under the boot of a brutal dictator.''
<p>

Annan has also provoked the Bush administration by saying its war on Iraq 
has increased terrorism, not decreased it.
<p>

At a press briefing last week, one U.N. correspondent asked the 
secretary-general pointedly: ''I know that U.N. policy is to say that you 
don't meddle in U.S. internal affairs.''
<p>

''But basically, you said recently that the war in Iraq was illegal. Before 
that you said that terrorism is on the rise, contradictory to what 
President Bush has said. That is being interpreted as you batting for 
(Democratic presidential candidate) John Kerry. Is that the case?”

<p>

Annan, who usually keeps his cool even under the most trying circumstances, 
was testy.
<p>

''I think you answered your own question (that U.N. policy is not to 
interfere in internal affairs). You don't want to pull me in; why are you 
pulling me in?''
<p>

But, added the U.N. chief: ''I think, when I make these comments, I make 
them from my own knowledge and from my own experience. I'm not saying them 
to support one side or the other. As secretary-general, I talk to lots of 
people, I travel the world, and I observe.''
<p>

''And I have comments that I made, and these are comments that I would have 
made whether there were elections or not. So don't infer anything from the 
comments and the observations that I make,'' Annan said.
<p>

The secretary-general is also refusing to send international employees to 
organise the elections in Iraq next January, drawing more angry reactions, 
not only from the Bush administration but also from the U.S.-installed 
interim government in Baghdad.
<p>

Many people believe the United States wants elections in Iraq so soon 
despite the ongoing violence in the country just to prove it has succeeded 
in bringing democracy to the nation -- and that it wants U.N. participation 
to provide legitimacy to those elections.
<p>

One right-wing U.S. newspaper called Annan an ''obstructionist'' working to 
''undercut the role of the United States in global affairs -- in 
particular, U.S. leadership in rebuilding Iraq.''
<p>

While the secretary-general is expected to be the ultimate diplomat in 
dealing with 191 member states -- at times almost simultaneously -- without 
ruffling any political feathers, the task grows if the U.N. chief happens 
to be up for re-election.
<p>


The secretary-general must then be sure not to antagonise any of the member 
states, least of all the five veto-wielding permanent members of the 
Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China.
<p>

When Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt failed to win a second term in late 
1996, it was because he irritated a single member state: the United States.
<p>

Despite the overwhelming majority in the Security Council voting for him 
(14-1), he was drummed out of office when Washington cast its veto against 
him.
<p>

Conversely, a secretary-general, who is not speculating on his next 
election, is more likely to be more forthright and independent-minded than 
plagued by nightmares of re-election.
<p>

This is more so the reason why a 1996 study jointly commissioned by the 
U.S.-based Ford Foundation and Sweden's Dag Hammarskjold Foundation 
proposed that a U.N. secretary-general should serve only one term -- 
possibly a single, non-renewable, seven-year term instead of the current 
limitless five-year stints.
<p>

This issue is expected to resurface when a high-level U.N. panel releases a 
report in November calling for major reforms in the world body and radical 
changes to the U.N. system.
<p>

Annan, who is on his second five-year term, apparently has no plans to run 
again when he completes his assignment in December 2006.
<p>

So, obviously, he also has no reason to curry favour with any member 
states, including the veto-wielders in the Security Council, likely 
explaining why the secretary-general has been more outspoken recently than 
ever before, according to U.N. watchers.
<p>

But what has irked the White House most is the timing: Annan's negative 
comments have come when Bush is in the midst of a re-election campaign, 
with polls due next Tuesday.

<p>

As John Danforth, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said of the 
secretary-general's comments about the legality of the war on Iraq: ''If I 
had been his (Annan's) adviser, which I wasn't, I would have advised him 
not to say it at all -- and if he was going to say it at all, not to say it 
now. But he did, and there's a difference of opinion.''
<p>

U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was equally critical of Annan's 
timing. ''I don't think it was a useful statement to make at this point.''
<p>

''What does it gain anyone?” Powell added. ”We should all be gathering 
around the idea and the prospect of helping the Iraqi people, helping the 
Iraqi government, and not gett4ing into these kinds of side issues which 
are not relevant any longer.''
