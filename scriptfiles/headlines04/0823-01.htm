<p>NAJAF, Iraq  - 

U.S. marines and Shi'ite militiamen
fought fierce battles around a shrine in the Iraqi city of
Najaf on Monday in some of the heaviest fighting since the
20-day-old rebellion erupted.
<p>
 At least 15 explosions, many sounding like artillery
shells, rocked the area near the Imam Ali mosque, where the
Mehdi Army fighters of radical Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada
al-Sadr have holed up in defiance of the U.S.-backed interim
government.
<p>
 Gunfire echoed through the alleyways near the shrine while
U.S. tanks kept up their encirclement around the city's heart.

All the action didn't prevent the 79-year-old man from sitting on a step and seeking spiritual comfort in the golden shrine, his weekly routine since he was a young boy.

Shrapnel landed in the courtyard of the gold-domed mosque,
whose outer walls have already been slightly damaged in
fighting that has killed hundreds and driven oil prices to
record highs.
<p>
News that Iraq's crude exports were back to normal on
Monday for the first time in two weeks could calm jittery oil
markets. Exports had been sharply reduced due to sabotage and
threats from militants.
 <p>
 Oil prices rose to nearly &#36;50 a barrel last week but have
since eased somewhat and U.S. light crude was trading around
&#36;47 a barrel on Monday.
 <p>
 Iraq resumed pumping crude along its northern pipeline, a
shipping agent said. The pipeline has largely been shut since
last year due to attacks, and only intermittently pumps oil.
 <p>
 The fighting around Iraq's holiest Shi'ite Muslim shrine
eased for a time but then broke out again in the early
afternoon, especially near an ancient cemetery that adjoins the
mosque. Large plumes of smoke rose into the air.
 <p>
 FRUITLESS TALKS
 <p>
 Overnight, a U.S. AC-130 gunship blasted rebel positions
after a weekend of fruitless talks between Sadr's aides and
religious authorities to hand over the keys of the shrine to
Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most respected Shi'ite cleric.
 <p>
 In an apparent relaxation of Sadr's demand that the Mehdi
Army guard the mosque even once it is handed over, a top Sadr
aide said Shi'ite authorities would be responsible.
 <p>
 "The religious establishment will be in charge of security
and they should have their own security force," said Sheikh
Ahmed al-Sheibani, also a Mehdi militia commander.
 <p>
 Speaking to reporters inside the mosque, Sheibani said the
cleric's fighters would become "normal citizens" if U.S. forces
returned to their bases and the southern city became stable.
 <p>
 The uprising is a brazen challenge to interim Prime
Minister Iyad Allawi, who took over from U.S.-led occupiers two
months ago and faces the daunting prospect of getting Iraq
ready for elections in January.
 <p>
 His government has tried to defuse the crisis with a mix of
threats to storm the shrine and peace offerings.
 <p>
 Sadr, the face of Shi'ite resistance in Iraq and whose
whereabouts are unknown, has at times appeared to accept the
government's demands only to spurn them later. Allawi has
insisted Sadr disarm his militia and take his grievances to the
political arena.
 <p>
 The rebellion has also triggered violence in seven other
southern and central cities, including Baghdad.
<p>
 Serious damage to the mosque could enrage millions of
Shi'ites and fuel hostility to the U.S. presence in Iraq.
<p>
READY TO FIGHT FOR MONTHS
<p>
There appeared to be fewer militia along the alleys leading
to the shrine on Monday than on previous days. But Sheibani
said fighters were being rotated.
<p>
Militants said they had enough food, water and ammunition
to last for weeks, maybe months.
<p>
"We are here to kill and we have enough stamina," said
Hamed Khudayir, 54, referring to himself and his 10-year-old
son Ali.
<p>
In fresh attempts to force foreign firms to leave Iraq, a
Turkish contractor and two Iraqis who worked for a construction
company were killed when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle in
the northern city of Tikrit, the U.S. military said.
<p>
An Indonesian worker was killed and a Filipino wounded in
the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Sunday.
<p>
The U.S. military said five of its troops were killed at
the weekend.
<p>
Sadr had insisted Sistani send a delegation to take an
inventory of precious items in the mosque before it was handed
over. Sheibani said that was no longer necessary.
<p>
Sistani, who usually lives in Najaf, is in London
recovering from surgery. An aide said his offer to mediate the
crisis by receiving the shrine's keys remained in place.
