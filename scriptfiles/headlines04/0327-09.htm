<p>WASHINGTON  — Republican Congressional leaders said Friday that they would seek to declassify past Congressional testimony from Richard A. Clarke, President Bush's former counterterrorism chief, in an effort to demonstrate that the former aide had lied this week about Mr. Bush's record.</p>
<P>
The move on Capitol Hill signaled a new intensity in the campaign by the Bush administration and its Republican allies to undermine the credibility of Mr. Clarke,  who served under several administrations.</p>
<P>
"Mr. Clarke has told two entirely different stories," Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said on the Senate floor as he condemned Mr. Clarke for accusing the Bush administration in a new book of largely ignoring the threat of Qaeda attacks before Sept. 11.  Mr. Clarke repeated his charge in testimony this week before the independent commission investigating the attacks.</p>
<P>
Yet in testimony before the 2002 joint Congressional inquiry into the attacks, Dr. Frist said, Mr. Clarke had been "effusive" in praising the administration's actions. Democrats on that earlier panel said they saw no inconsistency between Mr. Clarke's two sets of remarks.</p>
<P>
Mr. Clarke, the  former National Security Council aide, received support on Friday from an unlikely source — Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. In a television interview, Mr. Powell said  that Mr. Clarke had "served his nation very, very well" and was "an expert in these matters," referring to counterterrorism.</p>
<P>
While saying that Mr. Clarke's book is "not the complete story," Mr. Powell said on the PBS program "NewsHour" he was "not attributing any bad motives" to Mr. Clarke. </p>
<P>
"I'm not aware of a campaign against Mr. Clarke, and I am not a member," Mr. Powell said. "The book is the book, and you can read it and make your own judgment as to whether it's accurate."</p>
<P>
Dr. Frist  and other Republican Congressional leaders said their decision to seek declassification had not been coordinated with the White House. And it could put the White House in a potentially awkward spot since it is the administration that decides on declassification.</p>
<P>
Officials said that the decision on whether and when to declassify the testimony would be made at the White House after consultations with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon about the national security implications. A White House spokesman, Sean McCormack, said that "to my knowledge there was no coordination between Congressional Republicans and the White House on the request for the declassification of the documents."</p>
<P>
A move to declassify the testimony would sharply contrast with the  administration's insistence that parts of the final report of the Congressional Sept. 11 investigation remain secret. Hundreds of pages of that report have never been made public.</p>
<P>
The White House has also refused to allow Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to answer questions publicly before the independent commission now completing its investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks. The White House has said that Ms. Rice is willing to again appear before the panel in private and not under oath, but Democrats are pressing for her to testify publicly.</p>
<P>
Dr. Frist's announcement Friday that he would seek to declassify Mr. Clarke's two-year-old testimony before the House-Senate committee that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks caught many of his Senate colleagues by surprise.</p>
<P>
Referring to Mr. Clarke's six-hour appearance in 2002 before the joint Congressional inquiry — when  Mr. Clarke was still on the White House staff —  Dr. Frist said that Mr. Clarke was then "effusive in his praise for the actions of the Bush administration," in contrast to his appearance this week before the commission when he testified that the White House had failed to treat the terror threat with the proper urgency.</p>
<P>
Dr. Frist accused Mr. Clarke of "profiteering" with his book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743260244/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Against All Enemies: Inside the White House's War on Terror</a>" (Free Press) — which has jumped to the top of national bestseller lists — and branded as "theatrical" the apology that Mr. Clarke offered this week to relatives of Sept. 11 victims for failing to prevent the attacks.</p>
<P>
Dr. Frist said that to apologize "on behalf of the nation was not his right, his privilege or his responsibility."</p>
<P>
"In my view it was not an act of humility, but an act of supreme arrogance and manipulation," Dr. Frist said. "Mr. Clarke can and will answer for his own conduct, but that is all."</p>
<P>
Though Democrats said that Mr. Clarke had not been under oath in the 2002 interview with the joint Congressional committee, Dr. Frist said he had been and stopped just short of accusing him of perjury. "It is one thing for Mr. Clarke to dissemble in front of the media," Dr. Frist said. "But if he lied under oath to the United States Congress it is far more serious matter."</p>
<P>
Mr. Clarke, who was not immediately available for comment on Friday, according to a spokeswoman, testified under oath on Wednesday to the independent commission.</p>
<P>
Dr. Frist did not act alone. Representative  J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the House speaker who had warned that the  commission's work could become a "political football" in the middle of the presidential campaign, said on Friday he had joined the request to declassify Mr. Clarke's earlier testimony.</p>
<P>
"We need to lean forward in making as much information available to the public as possible, without compromising the national security interests of the nation," Mr. Hastert said in a statement.</p>
<P>
Congressional Democrats who were involved in the joint committee's investigation said their recollection of  Mr. Clarke's testimony was entirely different, and that they knew of no contradiction between what Mr. Clarke said then and what he was saying now.</p>
<P>
Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who was a co-chairman of the inquiry, said Friday that "to the best of my recollection, there is nothing inconsistent or contradictory in that testimony and what Mr. Clarke has said this week." </p>
<P>
A senior Democratic Congressional aide said Democratic staff members from both the Senate and House intelligence committees  reread Mr. Clarke's 2002 testimony on Friday and that they believed he had been "fully consistent" in his views.</p>
<P>
Mr. Graham said he supported the request to declassify Mr. Clarke's testimony. But he said it should be released in its entirety and that the White House should declassify other documents integral to Mr. Clarke's  testimony, including his January 2001 plan for action against Al Qaeda. Mr. Graham has also sought to release 27 pages of the report examining the involvement of foreign nations in support of the 19 hijackers.</p>
<P>
The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who served on the Congressional inquiry, criticized her Republican counterparts for joining in the attacks on Mr. Clarke, who left the White House last year. "Our democracy is not served and freedom of speech is undermined when the White House and its allies engage in character assassination," she said.</p>
<P>
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, who replaced Mr. Graham as the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, called Dr. Frist's comments "baseless and irresponsible." Any lawmaker who believed Mr. Clarke perjured himself, he said, should call in the Justice Department.</p>
<P>
Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican of Florida and chairman of the House Intelligence panel, said he initiated the process to declassify Mr. Clarke's testimony. Mr. Goss said Mr. Clarke's new accusations were markedly different from his  testimony in 2002.</p>
<P>
"They are certainly 180 degrees from my general recollection of the information he provided us before," said Mr. Goss, who was co-chairman of the  panel  with Mr. Graham. Mr. Goss said that if Mr. Clarke's views had changed, they should be reflected in the inquiry's findings and recommendations. "If he had all this startling information, it probably would have been useful to share it." </p>
<P>
Aides to Dr. Frist, whose bitter denunciation of Mr. Clarke came as  the Senate was winding down for the week, said he had not been encouraged by the White House to take up the matter. "He has been looking for an opportunity to present his views," said Bob Stevenson, the chief spokesman for the majority leader.</p>
<P>
Senior Republican officials in Congress said they did not see the effort to declassify the testimony as a bid to find lies that could lead to perjury charges, but  as a way to raise questions about Mr. Clarke's integrity.</p>
<P>
A Democrat on the independent commission, Timothy J. Roemer, a former House member from Indiana who also served on the joint Congressional panel, said he supported the effort to make Mr. Clarke's testimony public. Mr. Roemer added, though, that there should also be given consideration to "carefully, within the bounds of security" declassifying the private interviews that Ms. Rice gave last month to the independent Sept. 11 commission.</p>
