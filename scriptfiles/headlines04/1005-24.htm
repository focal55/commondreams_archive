The lawsuit, filed under the Freedom on Information Act in  U.S. district court in Washington, challenges a 1991 Pentagon  order banning media coverage of the arrival of the remains of  dead soldiers.
<P>
The order was issued during the Gulf War and continued  during the Clinton and current Bush administrations.
<P>
Ralph Begleiter, a journalism professor at the University  of Delaware, is seeking photographs and video from Dover Air  Force Base of arrival ceremonies honoring U.S. service  personnel killed in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
<P>
Pentagon spokeswoman Navy Lt. Commander Jane Campbell said  it would be inappropriate to comment on a pending legal matter.
<P>
However Campbell said the policy of excluding the media  from the Dover ceremonies was designed to protect the privacy  of relatives.
<P>
"Families and loved ones have never been prohibited from  being there at Dover but we have tried to not make it a media  event," she said.
<P>
The journalism professor was seeking the images from Dover  for academic research, the lawsuit said.
<P>
"It's all about allowing the American people to accurately  and completely assess the price of war," Begleiter said in a  statement released by his lawyer.
<P>
"The Pentagon's claim that personal privacy is the reason  for blocking release of pictures of soldiers' coffins doesn't  make sense," he said, adding that the pictures do not identify  any individual soldier.
<P>
The lawsuit charged that the Pentagon's refusal to release  the photographic records requested by the professor was not  justified under the law. It also noted that, over the years,  the Pentagon has made exceptions to its own rule.
