<p>WASHINGTON  - The Kerry campaign accused the Bush
administration on Friday of delaying a government report that
could show the number of starving Americans rose last year.
<p>

 The U.S. Agriculture Department's annual Household Food
Security report for 2003, considered by some as the most
authoritative estimate of hunger in the United States, was
supposed to be released around Oct. 28.
<p>

 Nancy McNiff, a spokeswoman for USDA's Economic Research
Service, which publishes the report, said it "was held for
further review."
<p>

 McNiff would not elaborate and referred further inquiries
to the USDA's main press office. USDA said a date has not been
set for the report to be released.
<p>

 USDA spokeswoman Julie Quick said the department was
allowing other agencies to review it first for accuracy.
<p>

Phil Singer, a spokesman for Democratic challenger John
Kerry  said: "Here's an example of the Bush 'see no evil, hear
no evil' philosophy at work."
<p>

 The Bush campaign did not immediately return a call for
comment.
<p>


 Last year, the USDA said 11.1 percent of American
households could not afford enough food for an active, healthy
lifestyle, up from 10.7 percent the year before. The report,
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, is based on a survey of
50,000 households last December.
<p>

 The report was published last year on Oct. 31 and the year
before on Nov. 12.
<p>

 Poverty is often linked to hunger and starvation. The
Census Bureau reported in August that the number of
poverty-stricken Americans rose by 1.3 million in 2003 to 35.9
million.
<p>

 The USDA report focuses on food insecurity -- that is not
having access to enough food for a healthy lifestyle. But it
also addresses hunger.
<p>

 The report said last year that in 2002 an estimated 3.8
million households in the United States (or 3.5 percent of U.S.
households) went hungry, up from 3.3 percent in 2001.
