<p>SAN ANTONIO - Clear Channel Communications Inc., the nation's largest radio station operator, has chosen Fox News Radio to provide national news for most of its news and talk stations in a deal expected to nearly double Fox's radio presence.

<P>No terms of the five-year cash deal were disclosed yesterday as the selection was announced. But Fox, a subsidiary of News Corp., said that if all options in the agreement are exercised, its radio service could have more than 500 affiliates by the middle of next year.



	
		


<P>Fox provides one-minute newscasts to 275 stations. Starting next year, it will provide more than 100 Clear Channel stations with a five-minute, top-of-the-hour newscast, a nightly news broadcast and around-the-clock dedicated national news coverage. Fox News will be in many of Clear Channel's most prominent news/talk stations, including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and San Diego.

<P>In return, Fox News Radio will have access to news produced by San Antonio-based Clear Channel's news network. Fox also expects to hire more news anchors, studios and staff, but said it was too early to be more specific.

<P>Clear Channel has 13 radio stations in Maryland - three in Baltimore, two in Frederick and eight in Salisbury/Ocean City. It was unclear yesterday if, or how, they would be affected.

<P>"This deal positions Fox News to become a significant player in the radio industry and is another example of our commitment to the medium," said Roger Ailes, Fox News chairman and CEO.

<P>This is the first time the two corporations have worked together, according to Jack Abernethy, an executive vice president for Fox.

<P>"Working this closely with a premiere national news provider for the majority of our news/talk stations makes overwhelming sense," John Hogan, chief executive officer of Clear Channel Radio, said in a statement. "Because of the breadth of this relationship, our local news directors will get a more customized and higher-quality national news product - and that's great for listeners."

<P>Clear Channel, which operates 1,200 stations, did not immediately return a call for comment on the deal and how it will affect current news providers.

<P>Shares in Clear Channel rose 48 cents to close at $33.63 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. News Corp. fell 8 cents to $18.09 on the NYSE.
