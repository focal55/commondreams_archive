<p>OSLO - The United Nations wants to study links
between the environment and human conflict to see how future
wars might be sparked by factors like global warming, a senior
official said Tuesday.
<p>
 Pollution, droughts, floods, storms, desertification and
rising sea levels are among possible triggers of wars in a
world with more and more people competing for limited
resources.
<p>
 "The environment can be a trigger of conflict but we don't
know enough about it," Steve Lonergan, Director of the U.N.
Environment Program (UNEP) division of early warning and
assessment in Nairobi, told Reuters.
<p>
 A new UNEP survey of governments round the world showed
that the two main gaps in environmental understanding were
links between the environment and conflict, as well as the
environment and poverty, he said.
<p>
 "Under climate change we expect more extreme events, more
floods, more droughts," said Lonergan, a Canadian scientist.
<p>
 He added that global warming could in turn lead to
instability by forcing people to move to other areas, causing
conflict with people already living there.
<p>
 Many scientists say that emissions of gases like carbon
dioxide, mainly from cars and factories, are blanketing the
planet and driving up temperatures.
 <p>
 "But this is not just about climate change -- resource
scarcity and abundance can also contribute to conflict," he
said. Abundant natural resources like diamonds and metals can
also cause conflicts.
 <p>
 He said that environment ministers from around the world,
due to meet in South Korea  in late March, were likely to
approve a new drive to widen U.N. understanding of the
environment and links to conflicts and poverty.
 <p>
 UNEP might set up a new secretariat on environmental peace
and conflict, he said.
 <p>
 "The classic case is water scarcity in the Middle East,"
said Lonergan. Lack of water is one underlying cause of
conflict between Israel and Syria and Israel and the
Palestinians.
 <p>
 Environmental damage has been a factor in political unrest
in nations from the Democratic Republic of Congo  to Haiti, he
said.
