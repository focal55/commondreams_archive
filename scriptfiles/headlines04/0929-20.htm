<p>An Army Reserve staff sergeant who last week wrote a critical 
  analysis of the United States' prospects in Iraq now faces possible disciplinary 
  action for disloyalty and insubordination. If charges are bought and the officer 
  is found guilty, he could face 20 years in prison. It would be the first such 
  disloyalty prosecution since the Vietnam War. </p>
<p>The essay that sparked the military investigation is titled <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig5/lorentz1.html" target="_new">&quot;Why We Cannot 
  Win&quot;</a> and was posted Sept. 20 on the conservative antiwar Web site <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com" target="_new">LewRockwell.com</a>. 
  Written by Al Lorentz, a non-commissioned officer from Texas with nearly 20 
  years in the Army who is serving in Iraq, the essay offers a bleak assessment 
  of America's chances for success in Iraq. </p>
<p>&quot;I have come to the conclusion that we cannot win here for a number of 
  reasons. Ideology and idealism will never trump history and reality,&quot; wrote 
  Lorentz, who gives four key reasons for the likely failure: a refusal to deal 
  with reality, not understanding what motivates the enemy, an overabundance of 
  guerrilla fighters, and the enemy's shorter line of supplies and communication. 
</p>
<p>Lorentz's essay contains no classified information but does include a starkly 
  critical evaluation of how the Bush administration has conducted the war. &quot;Instead 
  of addressing the reasons why the locals are becoming angry and discontented, 
  we allow politicians in Washington DC to give us pat and convenient reasons 
  that are devoid of any semblance of reality,&quot; Lorentz wrote. &quot;It is 
  tragic, indeed criminal, that our elected public servants would so willingly 
  sacrifice our nation's prestige and honor as well as the blood and treasure 
  to pursue an agenda that is ahistoric and un-Constitutional.&quot; </p>
<p>The essay prompted a swift response from Lorentz's commanders. In an e-mail 
  this week to Salon, Lorentz, declining to comment further on his piece, noted, 
  &quot;Because of my article, I am under investigation at this time for very 
  serious charges which carry up to a 20-year prison sentence.&quot; According 
  to Lorentz, the investigation is looking into whether his writing constituted 
  a disloyalty crime under both federal statute (Title 18, Section 2388, of the 
  U.S. Code) and Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. </p>
<p>According to the UCMJ, examples of punishable statements by military personnel 
  &quot;include praising the enemy, attacking the war aims of the United States, 
  or denouncing our form of government with the intent to promote disloyalty or 
  disaffection among members of the armed services. A declaration of personal 
  belief can amount to a disloyal statement if it disavows allegiance owed to 
  the United States by the declarant. The disloyalty involved for this offense 
  must be to the United States as a political entity and not merely to a department 
  or other agency that is a part of its administration.&quot; </p>
<p>Under UCMJ guidelines, the maximum punishment in the event of a conviction 
  would be a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and 
  confinement for three years. </p>
<p>Prosecutions are rare, however, says Grant Lattin, a military lawyer and retired 
  Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, because members of the military &quot;have 
  the constitutional right to express their opinions pertaining to the issues 
  before the public. Short of there being classified material and security issues, 
  people can write letters about military subjects. If you look at the Army Times, 
  you'll see letters from people on active duty complaining about this and that.&quot; 
</p>
<p>For instance, in September 2003, Tim Predmore, an active-duty soldier with 
  the 101st Airborne Division, based in northern Iraq, wrote a scathing letter 
  to his hometown newspaper, the Peoria Journal Star in Illinois. &quot;For the 
  past six months, I have been participating in what I believe to be the great 
  modern lie: Operation Iraqi Freedom,&quot; Predmore's letter began. &quot;From 
  the moment the first shot was fired in this so-called war of liberation and 
  freedom, hypocrisy reigned,&quot; he continued, labeling the war &quot;the ultimate 
  atrocity&quot; before concluding, &quot;I can no longer justify my service on 
  the basis of what I believe to be half-truths and bold lies.&quot; </p>
<p>Going beyond the UCMJ and prosecuting disloyalty as a federal crime is &quot;extraordinarily 
  rare,&quot; Lattin says, noting that the last published case was in 1970, in 
  U.S. vs. William Harvey. Under Title 18, Section 2388, it's a crime, punishable 
  up to 20 years in prison, &quot;when the United States is at war, [and a person] 
  willfully causes or attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or 
  refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or willfully 
  obstructs the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, to the 
  injury of the service or the United States.&quot; </p>
<p>In the Harvey case, a Vietnam-era soldier was accused of making disloyal statements 
  by urging a fellow soldier not to fight in Vietnam. &quot;Why should the black 
  man go to Vietnam and fight the white man's war and then come back and have 
  to fight the white man,&quot; Harvey told the soldier, adding that he &quot;was 
  not going to fight in Vietnam and neither should [you].&quot; The case was brought 
  before the U.S. Court of Military Appeals, which noted &quot;the language of 
  the comments were on the line between rhetoric and disloyalty,&quot; as well 
  as the fact that &quot;disagreement with, or objection to, a policy of the Government 
  is not necessarily indicative of disloyalty to the United States.&quot; The 
  court alternately upheld and reversed portions of Harvey's conviction for disloyalty. 
</p>
<p>As for Lorentz's case, Lattin, who served as a Marine judge advocate, says 
  it's not uncommon for commanders to threaten soldiers with legal action in order 
  to make a point: &quot;If they know there's an offense for a disloyal statement, 
  I wouldn't be surprised if he said, 'Knock it off.'&quot; Lattin doubts that 
  in the end Lorentz will face prosecution for his writings. &quot;After this 
  gets to lawyers and prosecutors who think about the consequences and the First 
  Amendment, I don't think this will go anywhere.</p>
