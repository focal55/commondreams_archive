<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - A judge Thursday dismissed criminal charges against a small-town mayor for marrying gay couples, saying the state failed to show it has a legitimate interest in banning same-sex weddings.
<p>
 New Paltz Town Court Justice Jonathan Katz also ruled that prosecutors failed to prove the law <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0604-03.htm">New Paltz Mayor Jason West</a> was charged with violating was constitutional.
 <p>
 West had faced the possibility of fines or up to a year in jail for presiding at the weddings of more than two dozen same-sex couples on Feb. 27. The weddings drew the Hudson Valley village of New Paltz into the growing national debate over gay marriage.
 <p>
 West remains barred from marrying same-sex couples under an order issued earlier this week by another judge. But he and his lawyer E. Joshua Rosenkranz called Katz's ruling a major victory for gay rights.
 <p>
 "If history is any guide, this is the beginning of an unstoppable trend in New York," Rosenkranz said.
 <p>
 Ulster County District Attorney Donald Williams said he disagreed with Katz's ruling and would appeal.
 <p>
 West, 27, faced 19 misdemeanor counts of solemnizing marriages for couples without a license.
