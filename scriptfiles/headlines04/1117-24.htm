National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to replace Secretary of State 
Colin Powell consolidates the control over U.S. foreign policy of the 
coalition of hawks that promoted the war in Iraq, led by Vice President 
Dick Cheney.
<p> <p>
					  
					  The promotion of Rice's deputy, Stephen Hadley, to take her place in the 
White House also confirms Cheney's pre-eminence in Bush's second term.

<p><p>
A major booster of national missile defence and the development of 
''usable'' mini-nuclear weapons, Hadley held a key policy position under 
the vice president when Cheney served as Pentagon chief under Bush's 
father, from 1989 to 1993.
<p><p>
Growing speculation that another Cheney ally, Undersecretary of State for 
Arms Control and International Security John Bolton, will be nominated to 
serve as deputy secretary of state under Rice is adding to the impression 
that the hawks are on the verge of a clean sweep.
<p><p>
As expected, the State Department's current number two, Richard Armitage, 
announced his resignation Tuesday, thus opening another key slot in the 
foreign-policy bureaucracy and one on which Bolton and his neo-conservative 
and ultra-unilateralist backers have had their eyes for months.
<p><p>
''This is a statement that Bush sees that what he's done in his first term 
is the way he wants to go into the second term, if not a bit more so'', 
said Jonathan Clarke, a former British analyst based at the libertarian 
Cato Institute and co-author of 'America Alone: The Neo-Conservatives and 
the Global Order'.
<p><p>
''It's a way of saying, 'If you liked what you saw in the first 
administration, you're going to love the second one','' he added in an 
interview.
<p><p>
Although Rice began her tenure as Bush's national security adviser a 
traditional ''realist'', stressing the importance of bolstering U.S. 
alliances and of committing U.S. troops overseas only in cases where vital 
national interests were threatened, she was careful from the outset to 
avoid alienating right-wing forces, particularly Cheney and Defence 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
<p><p>
On key issues, particularly surrounding the lead-up to the Iraq war, the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the U.S. posture toward Iran and North 
Korea, she more often either aligned herself with or deferred to the hawks, 
especially Cheney, than she sided with Powell.
<p><p>
That was an immense frustration to the former head of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, who had assumed at the beginning that, like himself, she was 
committed to the pragmatic multilateralism of Bush's father and their 
mutual mentor, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
<p><p>

Thus, Rice ordered an early draft of the administration's December 2002, 
National Security Strategy (NSS) that was written by Powell protege and 
current president of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass to be 
completely rewritten, according to James Mann, author of a highly regarded 
study of the Bush war cabinet, 'Rise of the Vulcans'.
<p><p>
''She thought the Bush administration needed something bolder, something 
that would represent a more dramatic break with the ideas of the past'', 
noted Mann.
<p><p>
As rewritten, the NSS marked a comprehensive endorsement of most of the 
controversial ideas put forward under Bush, including global U.S. military 
dominance, pre-emption against possible enemies, the aggressive promotion 
of democracy overseas and the rejection of multilateral mechanisms or 
treaties that might constrain the exercise of U.S. power.
<p><p>
But Rice appears to have been picked to run the State Department as much 
for her fierce personal loyalty to Bush as for her own foreign-policy views.
<p><p>
Recommended originally by Scowcroft and former Secretary of State George 
Shultz to serve as Bush's principal foreign-policy adviser during his 2000 
campaign, Rice, who shares a love of football and physical fitness with the 
president, hit it off immediately with the future leader.
<p><p>
During the last five years, she has frequently spent weekends at the 
presidential retreat at Camp David or at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, with 
the Bush family.
<p><p>
The closeness of her relationship with Bush -- something that entirely 
eluded Powell, whose unequalled international and popular standing appeared 
to evoke some resentment in both the president and vice president -- would 
normally be seen as a plus by the foreign service officers who toil at the 
State Department, because it ensures that their views will heard in the 
White House.
<p><p>
According to Mann, that may yet turn out to be the case. ''The White House 
saw Powell as an independent force and an independent operator'', he told 
IPS, adding that such independence limited his influence.
<p><p>
''Rice, who will be more hawkish, will also now be the spokesman for the 
State Department and for diplomacy within the administration, and I can 
imagine situations where, once in a while, the same policies that would 
have been rejected if they came from Powell might get a better reception at 
the White House because they came from Rice."

<p><p>
At the same time, Mann described the posting as ''Bush's way of 
establishing his political control over the State Department'', which has 
been seen by many of the hawks and their backers in the media as resisting 
the president's more aggressive policies. In this view, Rice, like newly 
assigned Porter Goss at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), will act as 
an enforcer of Bush's policy ''vision'' in the department and as a reliable 
communicator of the president's line to foreign governments.
<p><p>
''She will be a much more forceful advocate (of Bush's policy) to American 
allies and partners and less inclined to be a sponge for their 
frustrations'', according to Clarke. ''She'll be more inclined to take the 
fight to them and not allow the outside world to think that she is somehow 
a channel into the foreign-policy-making process to deflect or undermine 
the president's policies.''
<p><p>
Many State Department officials expressed serious concerns about Rice's 
appointment Tuesday, even as they were recovering from Monday's 
announcement by Powell that he was indeed leaving.
<p><p>
Powell, who devoted considerable time and effort to managing the 
department, had raised morale significantly from its nadir under his 
predecessor, Madeleine Albright, who tended to ignore the career officers 
in favour of a small group of political appointees. ''We're so sad to see 
him go'', said one veteran contacted by IPS, who noted that Rice's 
managerial experience has been far more limited.
<p><p>
Indeed, most analysts assess her experience overseeing the National 
Security Council (NSC) staff quite negatively because of her reluctance to 
take a position when policies were deadlocked, to ensure all sides were 
heard, and to enforce discipline on the various agencies once a policy was 
decided.
<p><p>
As a result, policy reviews in key areas, such as Iran and North Korea, to 
cite two of the most prominent examples, dragged on for months and in some 
cases were never completed.
<p><p>
To the great frustration of Powell and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
Director George Tenet, Rice tolerated informal channels of communication 
between the mainly neo-conservative appointees around Rumsfeld and Cheney's 
office, which is headed by his neo-con chief of staff and national security 
adviser, I Lewis 'Scooter' Libby.
<p><p>
Libby, whose own national security staff has been exceptionally large and 
aggressive, ''is able to run circles around Condi'', one former NSC staffer 
told IPS last year.
<p><p>

Hadley, an attorney by profession, is seen as a hard-line technocrat who 
has specialised in nuclear weapons and national missile defence. He has 
been a major advocate of pre-emption and the development of ''mini-nukes'' 
and other new nuclear weapons that could be used for conventional purposes.
<p><p>
Considered particularly discreet -- even self-effacing -- Hadley came under 
strong criticism in various reports in the run-up to the war in Iraq, 
primarily because of his close working relationship with Libby on promoting 
a number of now-discredited efforts to tie ousted Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and to assert that Hussein was 
reconstituting a nuclear-weapons programme.</p><NYT_COPYRIGHT>
