<p>WELLS  &#151;  Hundreds of protesters lined the entrance to the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve on Thursday to voice their opposition to President Bush's environmental policies.</P>

<P>

"Today we want to set the record straight that the Bush administration policies protect polluters, not Maine families," said Maureen Drouin of the Sierra Club. </P>

The administration says its policies are aimed at improving the environment and the economy at the same time, by making it easier for companies to meet standards and invest in better equipment to control pollution.<p></P>

<P>

 But environmentalists say the Bush administration's policies have weakened the Clean Air and Clean Water acts, resulting in more air pollution blown in from out-of-state industrial plants and higher levels of mercury in fish.</P>

<P>

 "It seems he's left no restriction untouched," said Kristen Salvatore of Richmond, when asked about Bush's environmental record. "Who's he to talk about the environment when he's done so much damage to it?"</P>

<P>

 More than 300 protesters of all ages were arranged behind a wooden fence across from the Wells reserve's Route 1 entrance at Antiques, which is owned by Wells resident Corey Daniels.</P>

<P>

 Daniels said he was proud to host the demonstration, and called Bush "the most dangerous president we've ever had."</P>

<P>

 Many in the crowd took offense that Bush chose Maine and the Wells reserve to deliver his message on Earth Day.</P>

<P>

 "I think he's a hypocrite for coming here to talk about the environment," said Diane Rivard of Wells. "He doesn't deserve the beauty of Maine."</P>

<P>

 Nedra Sahr of Eliot said she believed that Bush's record was consistent. "It's pro-business, pro-corporations and anti-environment," she said. </P>

<P>

 Many in the crowd brought their children and grandchildren, who hoisted signs of their own beside the adults.</P>

<P>

 "It looks pretty bad," said 13-year-old Pippa Stanley of Richmond, when asked what she thought of the president's environmental policies. "I think his way . . . lets off the big corporations."</P>

<P>

 As Bush's motorcade drew near, police instructed protesters to stay behind the fence or be arrested. No one was taken into custody, and the crowd chanted loudly as the president entered the reserve.</P>

<P>

 Bush did have some supporters lined along Route 1. Barbara Hanson, owner of Elms Centre Gifts, proudly wore a Bush-Cheney campaign button. "I really believe the man is sincere and he believes in what he's doing," she said.</P>

<P>

 Joan Van Epps drove all the way from Old Saybrook, Conn., to catch a glimpse of the president's motorcade.</P>

<P>

 "I think he's doing the best job he can," she said. "I came here to say that he is the best and we support him all the way."
