<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq - Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows of the cavernous Umm al Tabul mosque in Baghdad on Saturday, illuminating the single row of men who dared pray there following a U.S.-led raid last week that turned up dozens of weapons commonly used by insurgents.
<p>	The worshipers, whose full beards and cropped gowns indicated their strict interpretation of Islam, spoke defiantly about the U.S. troops who broke into the mosque and arrested 32 men, including some suspected foreign fighters. About half the detainees were freed by Saturday afternoon, but anger over the raid remained in Umm al Tabul and inside the nearby rundown shacks.
<p>	The leftover outrage expressed at Umm al Tabul on Saturday raises a key question for U.S.-led forces: Is a controversial raid that turns up a weapons cache and a few possible guerrillas worth the dozens of new enemies made in the process?
<p>	Inside one of the shacks behind the mosque, 37-year-old Jamila Issa and several other wives of men arrested in the raid wept behind black veils and said they warned their sons not to participate in the revenge attacks called for in an anti-American demonstration after Friday prayers.
<p>	But Issa, who is married to Umm al Tabul's resident imam, said she fears the insurgency U.S. forces sought to curb by the raid will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<p>	"They accused my husband - a religious man, a man who loves his children - of being a bomber," Issa said, surrounded by three of her nine daughters. "I just want to know the name of the bastard informant who told these lies to the Americans. May God destroy his house."
<p>	On Thursday, U.S. forces broke through the mosque's ornate wooden doors and uncovered dynamite, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, equipment for surface-to-air missiles and an array of other weapons.
<p>	U.S. military officials in Baghdad denied claims that troops ripped pages from the Quran and harassed women attending a prayer circle. Thirty-four men were arrested, including some the military said are suspected foreign fighters who used the mosque as a meeting place.
<p>	Military officials described the mosque as "a center of anti-Coalition activity and a major weapons storage area." They also said the raid followed a tip from an informant, but declined to disclose further details.
<p>	Men at the mosque Saturday said they kept only light weapons for protection from intruders. The women said Syrian drivers, Iranian tourists and other foreigners occasionally stop by to pray, but that any influx of non-Iraqis would draw immediate suspicion from the closely knit community of worshipers.
<p>	"You came to my house and you are not Iraq - should I tell you to leave?" Issa said to an American visitor. "This is not our way. Our doors are open."
<p>	Among the detainees was 63-year-old Ahmed al Jassem, the mosque's muezzin - the man who delivers the call to prayer five times a day. He said he was showering at the mosque in preparation for prayer when U.S. forces arrested him, nude, and questioned him about the ideology and loyalties of Umm al Tabul regulars.
<p>	"Our house of God was turned into a theater for the American military," said Jassem, who was released Friday without charges. "After the fall of the old regime, looters tried to steal even our carpets. Can I, an old man, protect this place alone? Of course, I had guns."	
<p>	The clothes and manner of the people at Umm al Tabul are associated with stricter teachings of Islam than adhered to by most of Iraq's Sunni Muslims. Neighbors said the mosque, built in 1965 from the same blueprints as one constructed in Egypt, attracts highly conservative worshipers who look to Saudi Arabia for guidance.
<p>	The people at Umm al Tabul said they understand such teachings cause alarm for U.S. officials who want to curb the spread of militant Islam. But this time, the worshipers insisted, troops got the wrong target.
<p>	"You hear explosions all night in Baghdad these days," Issa said. "What's next? Is my husband responsible for those, too?"
