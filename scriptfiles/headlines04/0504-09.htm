NEW ORLEANS  - Former Vice President Al Gore plans  to build a youth-oriented cable television network he hopes  will become an independent voice in a media industry dominated  by large conglomerates, he said on Tuesday.
<p> 
			
			Gore led an investor group that bought Newsworld  International from Vivendi Universal for an undisclosed sum. He  plans to relaunch the yet-unnamed channel to focus on public  affairs and entertainment for 18-to-34-year-olds and it will  not have a political affiliation.<p> 
			
			Speculation has swirled that Gore would launch a network to  counter Fox News Channel, which unseated CNN as the No. 1 U.S.  cable news channel with a formula of combining hard news  coverage with brash talk shows that some have criticized as  conservative.<p> 
			
			"This is not going to be a liberal network, or a Democratic  network in any way, shape, or form," the former vice president  said.<p> 
			
			Rather, he said, the reason for buying the network was to  create an independent source of information.<p> 
			
			"The trend toward consolidation and conglomerate ownership,  while understandable due to business dynamics, does present  some problems for the American people," Gore said. "Having an  independent voice is a very important value to safeguard."<p> 
			
			Gore will serve as chairman of the new network and told  Reuters he would be spending most of his time on the project.<p> 
			
			"I will be extremely active in this venture and I will not  hesitate to state a point of view on the issues that affect the  industry," Gore said.<p> 
			
			Gore made the announcement with business partner Joel  Hyatt, who founded a chain of low-cost storefront legal clinics  and is now a faculty member at the Stanford University Graduate  School of Business.<p> 
			
			Hyatt, who will serve as CEO of the venture, said the  network operates profitably, but would need significant  additional investment to be relaunched.<p> 
			
			Backers of the company, known as INdTV Holdings LLC,  include venture capital firm Blum Capital and Yucaipa  Companies, an investor in grocery stores headed by Democratic  fundraiser Ron Burkle.<p> 
			
			Other individual backers are a list of prominent Hollywood  and Silicon Valley figures, including Sun Microsystems  co-founder Bill Joy, former Warner Home Video president Warren  Lieberfarb and The West Wing actor Bradley Whitford.<p> 
			
			Newsworld International has 17 million subscribers and is  distributed on DirecTV, Time Warner Cable and in certain  Comcast markets.<p> 
			
			The network currently features 24-hour global news produced  by The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which Hyatt said  would remain for the "forseeable future."<p> 
			
			Gore and Hyatt gave little information on what would  replace the current programing.<p> 
			
			"It's going to be programing young people care about,"  Hyatt said. "The documentary is a format we'll use. We're going  to use the comedic format. We're going to be irreverent. We're  going to be bold."
<p> 
			
			Reports surfaced earlier last year that Gore was seeking  financial backers to acquire Newsworld International, but Hyatt  said the deal took almost a year to negotiate due to  complications related to the sale of Vivendi Universal's other  cable networks to GE.
