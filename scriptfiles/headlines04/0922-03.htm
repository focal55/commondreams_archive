<p>WASHINGTON  - Millions of U.S. citizens, including  a disproportionate number of black voters, will be blocked from  voting in the Nov. 2 presidential election because of legal  barriers, faulty procedures or dirty tricks, according to civil  rights and legal experts.<p>

The largest category of those legally disenfranchised  consists of almost 5 million former felons who have served  prison sentences and been deprived of the right to vote under  laws that have roots in the post-Civil War 19th century and  were aimed at preventing black Americans from voting.<p> 
			
			But millions of other votes in the 2000 presidential  election were lost due to clerical and administrative errors  while civil rights organizations have cataloged numerous  tactics aimed at suppressing black voter turnout. Polls  consistently find that black Americans overwhelmingly vote for  Democrats.<p> 
			
			"There are individuals and officials who are actively  trying to stop people from voting who they think will vote  against their party and that nearly always means stopping black  people from voting Democratic," said Mary Frances Berry, head  of the U.S. Commission on Human Rights.<p> 
			
			Vicky Beasley, a field officer for People for the American  Way, listed some of the ways voters have been "discouraged"  from voting.<p> 
			
			"In elections in Baltimore in 2002 and in Georgia last  year, black voters were sent fliers saying anyone who hadn't  paid utility bills or had outstanding parking tickets or were  behind on their rent would be arrested at polling stations. It  happens in every election cycle," she said.<p> 
			
			In a mayoral election in Philadelphia last year, people  pretending to be plainclothes police officers stood outside  some polling stations asking people to identify themselves.  There have also been reports of mysterious people videotaping  people waiting in line to vote in black neighborhoods.<p> 
			
			Minority voters may be deterred from voting simply by  election officials demanding to see drivers' licenses before  handing them a ballot, according to Spencer Overton, who  teaches law at George Washington University. The federal  government does not require people to produce a photo  identification unless they are first-time voters who registered  by mail.<p> 
			
			"African Americans are four to five times less likely than  whites to have a photo ID," Overton said at a recent briefing  on minority disenfranchisement.<p> 
			
			Courtenay Strickland of the Americans Civil Liberties Union  testified to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights last week that  at a primary election in Florida last month, many people were  wrongly turned away when they could not produce identification.<p> 
			
			BLACKS' BALLOTS REJECTED<p> 
			
			The commission, in a report earlier this year, said that in  Florida, where President Bush won a bitterly disputed election  in 2000 by 537 votes, black voters had been 10 times more  likely than non-black voters to have their ballots rejected and  were often prevented from voting because their names were  erroneously purged from registration lists.<p> 
			
			Additionally, Florida is one of 14 states that prohibit  ex-felons from voting. Seven percent of the electorate but 16  percent of black voters in that state are disenfranchised.<p> 
			
			In other swing states, 4.6 percent of voters in Iowa, but  25 percent of blacks, were disenfranchised in 2000 as  ex-felons. In Nevada, it was 4.8 percent of all voters but 17  percent of blacks; in New Mexico, 6.2 percent of all voters but  25 percent of blacks.<p> 
			
			In total, 13 percent of all black men are disenfranchised  due to a felony conviction, according to the Commission on  Civil Rights.<p> 
			
			"This has a huge effect on elections but also on black  communities which see their political clout diluted. No one has  yet explained to me how letting ex-felons who have served their  sentences into polling booths hurts anyone," said Jessie Allen  of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.<p> 
			
			Penda Hair, co-director of the Advancement Project, which  seeks to ensure fair multiracial elections, recently reported  that registrars across the country often claimed not to have  received voter registration forms or rejected them for  technical reasons that could have been corrected easily before  voting day if the applicant had known there was a problem.<p> 
			
			Beasley said that many voters who had registered recently  in swing states were likely to find their names would not be on  the rolls when they showed up on Election Day.<p> 
			
			"There is very widespread delay in the swing states because  there have been massive registration drives among minorities  and those applications are not being processed quickly enough,"  she said.
