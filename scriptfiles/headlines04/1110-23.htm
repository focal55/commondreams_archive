<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON - The biggest source of speculation about President 
George W Bush's foreign policy in a second term is if it will continue on 
the same aggressive trajectory that marked the first or whether, chastened 
by Iraq, it will be more restrained over the next four years.
					  
					  

Much will, of course, depend on who will get which positions in the new 
administration. If, as anticipated, Secretary of State Colin Powell and his 
deputy Richard Armitage decide to leave the government, a number of key 
posts will be up for grabs.
<p>
The capital's odds-makers are already taking bets on the outcome, with 
early indications that neo-conservatives and the hard-line nationalists who 
led the drive to war in Iraq and now favor confrontation with Iran, Syria, 
North Korea and other possible adversaries may actually extend control over 
key policy-making levers, especially in the National Security Council (NSC) 
staff and the State Department.
<p>
One close observer of the speculation, James Mann of the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), divides the major schools of 
thought into ''doomsayers'' -- those who believe Bush's second term ''is 
likely to produce further military interventions overseas, along the lines 
of Iraq in 2003'' -- and ''skeptics'' -- those who argue the second term 
''will turn out to be more cautious and less belligerent''.
<p>
Mann, author of 'Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet', 
predicts in an article in the 'foreign policy' section of the website of 
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that the skeptics are likely 
to prevail.
<p>
That is not because the administration will be less hawkish in temperament; 
indeed, everything Bush has said since his re-election would suggest the 
opposite -- but rather because it faces ''a series of constraints -- 
military, diplomatic, political and economic -- that will curb its ability 
to launch new preventive wars,'' he argues.
<p>
Because the U.S. Armed Forces are so bogged down in Iraq with no 
discernible end in sight, asks Mann, ''where is the administration going to 
come up with the troops for new military ventures in places such as Syria? 
 ... Any effort to commit U.S. forces elsewhere is likely to run into 
intense resistance among the uniformed military, from the joint chiefs of 
staff down to the rank-and-file''.
<p>
Mann sees these constraints as dictating a more ''realist'' and 
multilateral approach, such as that long urged by Powell and former 
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, even if the more-aggressive 
vision of U.S. global military domination remains at the heart of the new 
team.
<p>
But he does allow that the administration may still try to ''wield its 
military power in a way that doesn't require a lot of troops, such as 
through air strikes,'' an option that has already been contemplated for 
nuclear-related targets in Iran and North Korea.
<p>
Mann is clearly himself right on target, but he fails to mention another 
form of intervention that is poised to become the instrument of choice in 
the new term: covert action carried out by a reinvigorated and much more 
richly endowed clandestine service of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
and the Pentagon's Special Operations Command (SOC).

<p>
The annual intelligence budget has reportedly increased from just under 30 
billion dollars four years ago to around 40 billion dollars for fiscal year 
2005. While most of that money is earmarked for Pentagon agencies that 
collect intelligence through satellites and other technical means, Congress 
has called for a major build-up in human intelligence and covert 
capabilities, which stands to benefit the CIA's clandestine service in 
particular.
<p>
Moreover, the new CIA director, former Representative Porter Goss, is 
reportedly moving quickly to build up the clandestine service, apparently 
in hopes of returning it to its 1960s glory days, when he worked in its 
Latin America operations.
<p>
''The directorate of operation (DO) people are very pleased with his 
arrival'', said Melvin Goodman, a retired career CIA analyst who retains 
close ties to the agency. ''He's taking the line that covert action is 
important, that the agency has to be more imaginative and that he feels 
there are plenty of opportunities (for covert action) out there''.
<p>
At the same time, added Goodman, Goss is purging the analytical ranks in 
the CIA who were thought to be too critical of, if not disloyal to, the 
administration's policy line in the first term, and hiring as consultants 
former senior operations officers who were active in the 1980s, when former 
CIA Director William Casey was running several covert wars against alleged 
Soviet clients as part of the Reagan Doctrine (of former President Ronald 
Reagan, 1981-1989).
<p>
Also, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has made it clear that the SOC, 
which currently manages close to 50,000 Special Operations Forces (SOF) 
worldwide, is to play a pre-eminent role in the military's 
''transformation'' to a 21st-century fighting force and especially in the 
''war on terror''.
<p>
Moreover, unlike the CIA, which is subject to fairly strict congressional 
oversight and can only carry out a major covert action if the president 
makes a formal ''finding'' authorizing it, SOF units, whose actions are not 
technically considered ''covert action'', may operate with a much freer 
hand overseas, except when operating under the CIA's control, as was the 
case during the agency's Afghanistan campaign.
<p>
Rumsfeld has been pushing steadily for more money and greater freedom of 
action for SOC personnel, and he is succeeding in both. In just two years 
the SOC's budget has almost doubled and now stands at close to seven 
billion dollars for 2005.
<p>
As for its freedom of action, the SOC has been upgraded from a 
''supporting” command -- which lends out its personnel when regional 
commands demand them -- to a ''supported'' command, which means it can act 
as the leading force during war.
<p>

And just last week the Pentagon secured new authority that allows SOF to 
spend 25 million dollars a year providing ''support to foreign forces, 
irregular forces, groups or individuals'' aiding U.S. efforts against 
terrorists and other targets, reported the 'Los Angeles Times'. Until now, 
that kind of activity has been limited to the CIA.
<p>
While the total amount of money involved is fairly small -- Rumsfeld had 
asked for 50 million dollars -- that it was approved by Congress is seen by 
some observers as a first step by the Pentagon chief toward greatly 
expanding the kinds of intelligence activities SOF may carry out, in part 
to marginalize the CIA.
<p>
''I think that the timing for a new emphasis on covert operations is 
favorable to the administration at this point because it has ramped up the 
covert capabilities within the CIA and the (SOF)'', said John Prados, a 
prolific author on U.S. intelligence and foreign policymaking.
<p>
He added that the 25-million-dollar authorization for SOF to support 
irregular forces suggests ''the administration has specific activities in 
mind''.
<p>
''Some aspects of the Reagan administration that lent themselves to the 
kind of manipulation that Casey performed are, in fact, present in the 
current administration'', he argued, citing ''subordinate officials who are 
in effect executing their own agendas, considerable entrepreneurial 
laissez-faire in the bureaucracy and the attitude that the only question 
is, 'Can you get the job done?''.
<p>
If, in addition, Bush replaces Powell and other ''realists'' with 
individuals more in tune with the aggressive unilateralism that dominated 
policy after the terrorist attacks of Sep. 11, 2001, the new team will have 
a number of advantages in pursuing a covert agenda that Casey lacked, such 
as a Republican-led Congress, according to Prados.
<p>
''It will have a more sympathetic Congress, a president who is more 
conscious of what's going on but fully supportive, and a top layer of 
policy-makers who, instead of checkmating each other with bureaucratic 
stalemate, will be pushing in the same direction.''<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2004 IPS<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
