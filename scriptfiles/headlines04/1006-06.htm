<p>JERUSALEM   - Israel's plan to withdraw from  occupied Gaza will prevent a Palestinian state emerging and  freeze peacemaking, and all with Washington's approval, a key  adviser to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said Wednesday.<p> 
			
			Adviser Dov Weisglass effectively dismissed an  international "road map" peace plan.<p>

His remarks, coinciding with a massive Israeli offensive  into Gaza, will help Sharon win over far-right foes opposed to  Gaza "disengagement" and challenging his grip on power.<p> 
			
			"The significance of our disengagement plan is the freezing  of the peace process. It supplies the formaldehyde necessary so  there is no political process with Palestinians," Dov Weisglass  said in an interview published in Haaretz daily Wednesday.<p> 
			
			"When you freeze the process, you prevent the establishment  of a Palestinian state ... Effectively, this whole package  called a Palestinian state, with all it entails, has been  removed indefinitely from our agenda," Weisglass said.<p> 
			
			Palestinian leaders condemned the comments.<p> 
			
			"I believe he has revealed the true intentions of Sharon.  We told the quartet (of U.S.-led peace mediators) eight months  ago that the Gaza plan was designed to undermine their road  map," said Palestinian Negotiations Minister Saeb Erekat.<p> 
			
			Weisglass said there would be no talks on key issues such  as Palestinian refugees, borders and the status of Jerusalem in  the foreseeable future. "And all this with authority and  permission, all with a presidential blessing."<p> 
			
			President Bush in April approved Sharon's plan to pull  settlers from tiny Gaza in 2005 while holding onto larger  Jewish enclaves in the West Bank, displacing the "road map"  which promises Palestinians a viable state.<p> 
			
			"By the way the Americans read the situation, the blame  fell on the Palestinians, not on us, Arik (Sharon) grasped that  (the Palestinians) would not leave us alone ... and time was  not on our side," Haaretz quoted Weisglass as saying.<p> 
			
			"What I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that  part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the  rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into  Finns," he said.
<p> 
			
			IMPASSE<p> 
			
			Weisglass blamed Palestinian suicide bombings and militant  violence for the diplomatic vacuum. Palestinians blame Israeli  offensives as well as continued settlement activity in the West  Bank. Israel captured both lands in the 1967 Middle East war.<p> 
			
			Israel's dovish opposition said peace should come first.<p> 
			
			"These stalling games will come at our expense. Can Israel  expect to stop diplomatic processes around the world? We should  not delude ourselves," said Labor Party leader Shimon Peres.  "Until we have peace we (cannot expect) calm and security."<p> 
			
			Weisglass said 190,000 of the 240,000 settlers would stay  in place under Sharon's plan which suggests 40,000 more  settlers would leave than the "disengagement" plan previously  foresaw.<p> 
			
			Palestinian leaders say "disengagement" is a gambit to dash  their statehood dream by confining 2.5 million Palestinians in  the West Bank to patches of land separated by settlement blocs.<p> 
			
			They fear Sharon feels free to do as he pleases given  Bush's preoccupation with a re-election campaign in which he  will need Jewish votes, and with a troubled U.S.-led occupation  of Iraq.<p> 
			
			Israeli armored forces stormed into northern Gaza a week  ago in a concerted bid to smash militants responsible for  frequent rocket fire into nearby Israeli border areas.<p> 
			
			Seventy-five Palestinians have been killed, 30 of them  civilians, according to local hospital figures. Three Israelis  including a woman settler have been killed.<p> 
			
			Washington Tuesday vetoed a draft U.N. Security Council  resolution demanding an immediate end to Israel's offensive,  saying it failed to mention Palestinian attacks.
