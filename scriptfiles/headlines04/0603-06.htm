Whether Washington or its few Iraqi friends are the biggest winners in the line-up of figures who have emerged as Iraq's interim government, the clear loser is Lakhdar Brahimi, the veteran UN envoy. <P>Barely six weeks ago, he seemed an all-powerful figure. He had persuaded the Americans to give him the right to select the new government, making it clear he would listen to a broad range of Iraqis. Because of the unpopularity of the US-appointed governing council, he indicated he would choose a group of technocrats to run Iraq until elections at the end of the year.  <P>Although it was unlikely he would pick anyone totally unacceptable to Washington, he was not intending to give the Americans a veto. He also announced, with the support of the Americans, that the governing council would be abolished.  <P>Yet now, after a week of public clashes over who would get the main jobs of president and prime minister, Mr Brahimi's choices have been overruled in humiliating circumstances.  <P>Hussain al-Shahristani, a nuclear scientist jailed by Saddam Hussein for 10 years, was due to get the prime minister's job. He was the ideal technocrat. A secular Shia whose criticisms of the Americans were close to those of the main Shia religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, he had declined a post on the governing council last year on the grounds that it would be seen as a US puppet.  <P>Smarting at their imminent demise, leading members of the council revolted. They pre-empted Mr Brahimi's choice of prime minister by publicly announcing they had picked Ayad Allawi, a well-known exile politician with close links to the CIA and MI6. Mr Allawi was an ardent supporter of the US invasion and, according to the opinion polls, has almost no backing in Iraq. Mr   Brahimi was said to be furious. Trying to be as diplomatic as possible, Fred Eckhard, the UN spokesman in New York, called the way the announcement had been made "a surprise".  <P>The problem was that the Americans, after first agreeing to the idea of a technocratic government, had changed their minds. They accepted the complaints of their friends on the governing council that they could not all be shunted aside. The Americans were also afraid that genuine independents might call for a US troop pullout.  <P>So Washington dispatched Robert Blackwill, the national security council's Iraq specialist, to Baghdad to work closely with the chief administrator, Paul Bremer, shortly before Mr Brahimi returned.  <P>"First Blackwill watered down Brahimi's plan. Then the governing council deliberately sabotaged it. The council undermined Brahimi and the US didn't support him," said Toby Dodge, an Iraq expert at Warwick University.  
<P>Choosing a president, a largely ceremonial job, turned into similar chaos, though this time the Americans did not get all their own way. They and Brahimi favored Adnan Pachachi, a   former foreign minister. But the governing council, with the bit between their teeth, went for Sheikh Ghazi al-Yawar.  
<P>Unlike the Shahristani/Allawi contrast, there is little difference between the views of Mr Pachachi and Sheikh Ghazi. Both are Sunnis and secular nationalists who criticized the excessive use of US force in Falluja. Both want a time limit on the US troop presence, even if they do not call for immediate withdrawal.  
<P>But Mr Brahimi and his favored candidate Mr Pachachi were outsmarted, as governing council members spread the word in the Arab media that Mr Pachachi was a US puppet. This doomed him.  
<P>"It's astonishing that Brahimi was marginalized as much as he was," Professor Michael Clarke, director of the international policy institute at King's College, London, said yesterday. "The governing council was a very weak vessel but it wanted to flex its muscles."  
<P>The resulting government includes four key former members of the governing council, is dominated by former exiles, and will have as hard a job to win credibility among Iraqis as the council did.  <P>Mr Allawi celebrated his appointment as prime minister by publicly thanking the Americans.  
<P>"We're grateful to the national alliance led by the Americans who have sacrificed so much to liberate us," he said in effusive language that no other prominent Iraqi Arab - with the exception of Washington's former favorite, Ahmad Chalabi - has used for more than a year.  
<P>Meanwhile, Mr Brahimi was left licking his wounds as he tried to retrieve something from the wreckage by starting a search for nominees to a national consultative council. It will not have legislative powers but it may provide a forum from which new Iraqi politicians can emerge.  <P>In an undiplomatic flash of anger, the UN envoy told reporters: "I'm sure he doesn't mind me saying that Bremer is the dictator of Iraq. He has the money. He has the signature. Nothing happens without his agreement in this country."
