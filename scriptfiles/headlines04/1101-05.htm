      <p>WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush's re-election campaign for the 
        White House has outpaced rival John Kerry's camp in mounting television 
        advertisements featuring personal attacks, according to a study. 
      <p>According to <a href="http://presidentialcampaign2004.coas.missouri.edu/AdWars04.htm" target="_new">the 
        study</a> of 225 presidential campaign television ads released up until 
        last week, 53 percent of statements in Bush's ads attacked Kerry, compared 
        with 45 percent of claims in Kerry's TV spots which attacked the incumbent 
        Republican president. 
      <p>The survey was conducted by University of Missouri-Columbia communication professor William Benoit.
      <p>&quot;President Bush's television ads have made more personal attacks 
        that Kerry's. However, the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) ads have 
        been more negative than either candidate's,&quot; the study found. 
      <p>Benoit examined 225 TV campaign ads: 50 from Bush, 79 from Kerry, 23 from the DNC, 46 from pro-Kerry groups and 27 from pro-Bush groups.
      <p>The Republican National Committee, which tends to co-sponsor ads with 
        Bush, had only one sole-sponsored ad. 
      <p>The DNC attacked more than either candidate with 82 percent, while conservative groups attacked in 84 percent of their ad statements and liberal groups attacked in 81 percent of their statements, it said.
