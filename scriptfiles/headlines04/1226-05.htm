COLOMBO, Sri Lanka  - One of the most powerful
earthquakes in history hit Asia Sunday, unleashing a tsunami
which devastated coastal areas of Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia
and tourist isles in Thailand, killing nearly 9,500 people.
<p>
 The tsunami, a menacing wall of water, wreaked death, chaos
and destruction across southern Asia. Up to 30 feet high, the
tsunami was triggered by an 8.9 magnitude underwater earthquake
off the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
<p>

 Emergency services struggled around the region popular with
Western tourists flying east for Christmas sunshine. Some areas
were totally unprepared and tourists found their holidays
turned into disaster zones while anxious families at home
awaited news.
<p>
 In Sri Lanka, where the death toll reached 3,500, corpses
floated in floodwaters, while thousands fled their homes and
cars floated out to sea. Idyllic beaches were turned into
fields of debris and destruction. Around 750,000 people were
displaced.
<p>
 "I think this is the worst-ever natural disaster in Sri
Lanka," N.D. Hettiarachchi, director of the National Disaster
Management Center, said of the effects of the earthquake, the
worst for 40 years and the fifth biggest since 1900.
<p>
 The worst-hit area appeared to be the tourist regions of
the south and east where beach hotels were inundated or swept
away.
<p>
 Local media reported land mines sown during Sri Lanka's two
decade civil war had been uprooted and spread by floods. Others
used the mayhem to loot shops and houses, police said.
<p>
 In Indonesia, where 2,583 were killed, raging waters
dragged villagers out to sea and tore children from their
parents' arms.
<p>
 Wailing relatives gathered around bodies in the south of
India, where more than 1,870 died. Beaches were littered with
submerged cars and wrecked boats. Shanties on the coast of
Madras, where 100 died, were under water.
<p>

 "The whole area has been turned into a cemetery,"
Chellappa, a 55-year-old fisherman in Madras, said.
<p>

NIGHTMARE STORIES
<p>
 Tourists had nightmare stories.
French tourist Philippe Gilbert, at a hotel near Tangalle in
the south of Sri Lanka, told private channel LCI:
<p>
 "I've lost my granddaughter in all of this. I was swept
away by an absolutely massive wave ... I was lucky enough to
get stuck in some trees and was able to hold my breath," he
said.
<p>
 "This is one of the largest earthquakes ever on record. The
situation in Sri Lanka ... is extremely serious," Peter Rees,
of the International Federation of the Red Cross in Geneva,
told CNN television.
<p>
 "I just couldn't believe what was happening before my
eyes," Boree Carlsson told Reuters from a hotel 500 meters
(yards) from Phuket's Patong beach in Thailand. "As I was
standing there, a car actually floated into the lobby and
overturned because the current was so strong," said the
45-year-old Swede.
<p>
 "Nothing like this has ever happened in our country
before," said Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand
where the death toll was 310.
<p>

 The total death toll was nearly 9,500 people at 1733 GMT.

<p>
 "Death tolls are likely to increase over time. I'm sure the
numbers will go up," said Titon Mitra, emergency response
director for the CARE aid agency in Geneva.

<p>
The earthquake of magnitude 8.9 as measured by the U.S.
Geological Survey  struck at 7:59 a.m. (0059 GMT) off Sumatra
and swung north with tremors into the Andaman islands.
<p>
A warning center such as those used along the Pacific Rim
could have saved most of the thousands of people who died, A
USGS  official said. "And I think this will be a lesson to
them," he said, referring to the devastated countries.
<p>
Pope John Paul  said the tragedy made for a sad Christmas.

<p>
SRI LANKA'S WORST DISASTER
<p>
Sri Lanka appealed to the world for aid, saying that one
million people, or 5 percent of its population, were affected.
The global Red Cross launched an immediate emergency appeal.
<p>
India feared a devastating toll along its southeastern
coast. In the state of Tamil Nadu alone, an official said at
least 1,625 had been killed. Rescuers were searching for
hundreds of missing fishermen and thousands were homeless.
<p>
Television footage showed bodies, including young girls,
being thrown into trucks in Madras, capital of Tamil Nadu
state.
<p>
Hundreds fled to higher ground with pots, pans and other
meager possessions. People carried bodies in hessian sacks to
hospitals where dozens of dead already lined the corridors.
<p>
In Andhra Pradesh, about 400 fishermen were feared missing
and 200 Hindu devotees who had gone to the beach for a holy dip
in the morning were feared dead.
<p>
Almost 500 tourists were stranded on a rock in the sea off
India's southernmost tip, witnesses said. About 3,000 people
were listed as dead in India.
In the Maldives, none of the thousands of foreign visitors in
the beach paradise, was believed to have been killed although
some had suffered minor injuries.
<p>
In holiday islands off southern Thailand, emergency workers
rescued about 70 Thai and foreign divers from the famed Emeral
Cave and dozens were evacuated from around other islands. Two
Thais were killed at Emeral cave.
<p>

Officials said more than 600 tourists and residents were to
be evacuated from Ko Phi Phi. The tiny island made famous by
the 2000 film "The Beach" starring Leonardo DiCaprio was
flattened.
<p>
The Thai government ordered the evacuation of stricken
coastal areas, which included popular beach resorts on the
islands of Phuket and Krabi. Thousands were injured in
Thailand.
<p>
RING OF FIRE
<p>
Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands, lies along the
Pacific Ring of Fire where volcanoes regularly erupt.
<p>
The worst affected area was Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh
province, where 1,400 were killed. More than 200 prisoners
escaped from a jail when the tsunami knocked down its walls.
<p>
The earthquake was the world's biggest since 1964, said
Julie Martinez, at the USGS in Golden, Colorado. "It is
multiple earthquakes along the same faultline."
<p>
The tsunami was so powerful it reached across the ocean to
smash boats and flood areas along the east African coast.
