<p>BAGHDAD   - At least 25 people were killed and many wounded by an explosion which tore through the headquarters of a Kurdish party in Baghdad on Tuesday, police at the scene said. 

<p>The blast was at the offices of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, close to Iraq's Foreign Ministry and an entrance to the "Green Zone" compound where the U.S.-led administration in Iraq is based. Shooting rang out after the explosion. 

<p>Policeman Sattar Jabar said he had seen at least 25 bodies and that more than 20 people had been wounded. 

<p>A huge crater was blown into the ground at the entrance to the building. 

<p>The blast came as U.S. and Iraqi officials announced the names of an Iraqi government due to formally take over sovereignty from the occupying powers on June 30. 

<p>Saad Adnan a driver at the transport ministry, said he was driving past the PUK headquarters when it was hit by the blast. 

<p>He said guards at the building opened fire after the blast, killing some bystanders. 

<p>Adnan said he saw several bodies. "One of the dead was a woman. Only her head was left," he said.
