OSLO  - Saying that harpoons mean unacceptable
cruelty in slaughtering whales, animal welfare groups launched
a global campaign Tuesday to outlaw hunts of the biggest
creatures on the planet.
<p>
 "There is no humane way to kill a whale," said Peter
Davies, director-general of the World Society for the
Protection of Animals (WSPA), among leaders of a coalition of
200 groups in 58 nations behind a 150-page report on whaling.

      Saying that harpoons mean unacceptable cruelty in slaughtering whales, animal welfare groups launched a global campaign ON March 9, 2004 to outlaw hunts of the biggest creatures on the planet.

Titled "Troubled Waters," it criticized a lack of
international rules on hunts by major whaling nations -- Japan,
Norway, and Iceland. It estimated that whales died on average
two minutes after they are hit by grenade-tipped harpoons.
<p>
"On grounds of animal welfare alone...all whaling
operations should be halted," it said, adding that about 20,000
whales had been harpooned since an International Whaling
Commission (IWC) moratorium took effect in 1986. Another 1,400
would die in 2004.
 <p>
 Whaling nations say that stocks of some whales, especially
the small minke whale, have rebounded and are plentiful enough
for traditional catches. They say modern harpoons mean
cetaceans die with no undue suffering.
 <p>
 But British naturalist Sir David Attenborough wrote in an
introduction to the report: "There is nothing in the body of a
whale, which is of use to us, for which we cannot find
equivalents elsewhere."
 <p>
 BIGGER THAN DINOSAURS
 <p>
 "They are the largest animals that have ever existed, far
larger than any dinosaur," he wrote, arguing that whales were
"highly evolved animals with all the sensitivities that
statement implies." The blue whale is the largest.
 <p>
 "In every other food production business there are rules.
For whaling there are none," Davies of the London-based WSPA
told Reuters. He said farm animals like pigs or cows faced a
more humane death in a slaughterhouse.
 <p>
 Norway says whaling should be compared to hunting -- like
elk or foxes -- rather than to methods in a slaughterhouse.
 <p>
 The report said the IWC lacked rules on the number of
harpoons or bullets that can be fired at a whale, maximum
pursuit times, upper limits on the acceptable time to death and
laid down no reliable method for judging when a whale was dead.
 <p>
 It said Japan and Norway used similar hunting methods, for
instance, but that Oslo said that 80.7 percent of whales in
2002 were killed instantaneously while Japan recorded only 40.2
percent as instantaneous kills in the Antarctic in 2002-03.
 <p>
 Groups backing the report include the Humane Society of the
United States, Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society
and the Japan Animal Welfare Society.
 <p>
 It says harpooning methods were little changed in over a
century and quoted from a British ship's surgeon, Harald
Lillie, from a whaling trip to the Antarctic in 1947:
 <p>
 "If we can imagine a horse having two or three explosive
spears stuck in its stomach and being made to pull a butcher's
truck through the streets of London while it pours blood into
the gutter, we shall have an idea of the present method of
killing.
 <p>
 "The gunners themselves admit that if whales could scream,
the industry would stop for nobody would be able to stand it."
