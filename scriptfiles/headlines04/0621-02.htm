<p>WASHINGTON  - Moses Murphy was as Republican as  they come. The 27-year-old former Marine always voted a  straight ticket and his Jeep Cherokee sported three  "Bush-Cheney '04" bumper stickers.<p> 
			
			But two months ago as the Boardsman, Ohio, resident was  surfing the Internet, he came across the Web site for the  <a href="http://www.constitutionparty.com/" target="_new">Constitution Party</a>, a small, conservative group still  struggling to be on the ballot in every state.
<p> 
			
			Off came the Bush paraphernalia and now Murphy's Jeep is  plastered with stickers for Michael Peroutka, the Constitution  Party's little-known presidential nominee.<p> 
			
			Media attention has focused on Ralph Nader as a potential  spoiler to presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry, but  President Bush could face a similar threat from third party  candidates on the right.<p> 
			
			The Constitution and Libertarian parties believe they could  siphon away enough disenchanted conservatives to tip a close  election.<p> 
			
			For Murphy, Bush's proposal to grant amnesty to illegal  immigrants living in the United States was the final straw.<p> 
			
			"We can't keep letting illegals come in; we need troops on  the border," Murphy said in a telephone interview. "(Bush's)  views no longer reflect my views, and I need to vote my  principles."<p> 
			
			The party occupying the White House is typically more prone  to disgruntled ideologues bolting for a third party, said  Lawrence Jacobs, director of the 2004 Elections Project for the  Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota.<p> 
			
			And hardline conservatives have no shortage of gripes with  the president they helped elect. Topping the list is the  dramatic increase in federal spending, especially the $500  billion new Medicare entitlement for prescription drugs Bush  pushed through Congress, said Paul Weyrich, head of the Free  Congress Foundation and a leading conservative activist.<p> 
			
			Weyrich said grassroots conservatives "have a real problem  with this administration's out of control spending."<p> 
			
			TIPPING THE BALANCE<p> 
			
			But it is unclear whether this grumbling on the right will  translate into votes for the Libertarian or Constitution party  nominees.<p> 
			
			In 2000, the Libertarian nominee received only about  385,000 votes or 0.36 percent, and conservative commentator Pat  Buchanan won about 450,000 or 0.42 percent. By contrast, Nader,  running from the left, took almost 3 million votes or 2.74  percent and possibly swung the election to Bush with a strong  Florida showing.<p> 
			
			Any defections from Bush's base would be "minuscule" said  Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report,  and the policy gripes of Washington political elites do not  necessarily resonate among the Republican rank-and-file.<p> 
			
			"Spokesman for the conservative movement see it as their  job to grumble" when politicians on the right begin to stray,  Rothenberg said.<p> 
			
			However, even a handful of defections in key states could  tip the balance. For Bush to have a hope of winning, Rothenberg  said, his support among Republicans cannot dip much below 90  percent.<p> 
			
			Unlike Nader, who was on 43 state ballots in 2000 as the  Green Party nominee and is struggling to match that this year,  the Libertarian nominee is typically on the ballot in all 50  states, Jacobs said.<p> 
			
			The Constitution Party was on the presidential ballot in 42  states in 2000.<p> 
			
			Libertarians have already proven they can decide the  outcome of close elections. In the 2002 South Dakota Senate  race, the Republican challenger lost by about 500 votes, with  the Libertarian candidate receiving more than 3,000.<p> 
			
			That same year, Libertarian candidates in the Wisconsin and  Oregon gubernatorial races received 11 and 5 percent  respectively, far exceeding the Democrat's margin of victory.<p> 
			
			Bush lost both Oregon and Wisconsin by less than a  percentage point in 2000, and both will be in play this year.<p> 
			
			Swing states like New Hampshire and Nevada may also be  fertile ground for Libertarians, Jacobs said.<p> 
			
			But the Libertarian and Constitution party platforms could  be an obstacle in peeling away conservative votes from Bush.<p> 
			
			Both sound familiar conservative themes of slashing  government and lowering taxes, but they also advocate the  immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and the  Libertarians are socially liberal, supporting abortion rights  and drug legalization.<p> 
			
			A general rule of thumb, Rothenberg said, is that about  half of the voters who support third parties are outsiders who  would not vote if their candidate was not running.<p> 
			
			But if his candidacy does siphon away enough conservatives  from Bush to put Kerry in the White House, Libertarian  presidential nominee Michael Badnarik says that is fine with  him. There is little difference between the major parties, he  said, and playing the spoiler in a presidential election would  greatly enhance Libertarians' national profile.<p> 
			
			Peroutka, the Constitution nominee, said a Kerry victory  could even help the conservative cause by prompting Republicans  in Congress, who have approved Bush's spending increases, to  oppose similar measures proposed by Kerry.
