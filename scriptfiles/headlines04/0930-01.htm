<p>Anti-nuclear protesters are preparing for a game of cat and mouse with French and British authorities as two ships loaded with weapons-grade plutonium approach the Channel in the next few days.</p>

<!--/endimage/-->The two British ships, with an escort of Royal Marine commandos, are transporting 140kg of military-surplus plutonium - enough to make 30 nuclear warheads - for experimental conversion to nuclear fuel in the south of France.</p>
<p>
The ships, which left Charleston, south Carolina, on 20 September, are designed to carry radioactive materials. Their progress across the Atlantic is being monitored by satellite and aircraft.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://greenpeace.datapps.com/stop-plutonium/en/index_en.php3" target="_new">Greenpeace</a> ship, <i>L'Esperanza</i>, and a flotilla of yachts, hope to impede the plutonium shipment before it reaches Cherbourg for a 600-mile road journey to a nuclear processing plant in the Rh&ocirc;ne estuary.</p>
<p>The precise whereabouts and movements of the British-flagged, nuclear transports - the <i>Pacific Teal </i>and the <i>Pacific Pintail</i> - are being kept secret to prevent protesters from intercepting them at sea. Greenpeace officials expect the ships to dock in Cherbourg this weekend, probably at night.</p>

<p>"The US and France are unnecessarily threatening international security and the environment. There is no conceivable justification for this transport," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International.</p>
<p>The US will have no capacity to convert military plutonium into nuclear power station fuel - a process never attempted before - until next year. Washington has awarded a &#8364;243m (&#163;167m) experimental contract to convert the plutonium into fuel for nuclear reactors - mixed oxide fuel or Mox - to the French company, Areva. Once converted, the fuel will be shipped back to the US early next year.</p>
<p>The contract for transporting the material has been awarded to a British company, whose ships are - exceptionally - being guarded by a unit of Royal Marine commandos.</p>

<!--/endimage/-->Greenpeace and other anti-nuclear campaigners say that the movement of weapons-grade plutonium half the way around the world in this way is an invitation to catastrophe: either a radioactive leak or an attempt by a terrorist group to seize the shipment to make a nuclear bomb of its own.</p>
<p>Protests are planned all along the route from Normandy to the Rh&ocirc;ne estuary but the plutonium is expected to travel at night along a secret route.</p>
<p>The consignment represents a tiny portion of the 34 tons of excess weapons grade plutonium which the US must dispose of as part of a disarmament agreement with Russia.</p>
<p>Jacques-Emmanuel Saulnier, a spokesman for Areva, accused Greenpeace and other "militant ecologists" of hypocrisy. He added: "They fought for years for the elimination of military-grade plutonium and now they are protesting against a process which is part of that elimination".</p>

<p>Greenpeace says that military-grade plutonium should not be recycled for peaceful purposes but mixed with radioactive waste, solidified or vitrified, and stored.</p>
