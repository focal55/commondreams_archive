<!--/endimage/-->The world's No. 2 oilfield services company, which is also  fighting accusations it overcharged on contracts in Iraq and  Afghanistan, said late on Wednesday the probe concerns the  multibillion dollar TSKJ Bonny Island liquefied natural gas  plant project.<p> 
			
			Talks of bribes took place at least 10 years ago, it said.  Cheney was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 to 2000.<p> 
			
			The Wall Street Journal, citing company officials, said  there is no indication Cheney knew of improper activity. The  Republican on Wednesday accepted his renomination as vice  president.<p> 
			
			Halliburton said it hasn't found evidence that officials  from the TSKJ consortium ever made payments. But it said the  consortium entered into several "agency agreements" related to  the project, beginning in 1995.<p> 
			
			Nigeria in February said it was investigating allegations  the consortium kicked back as much as $180 million to secure a  contract for the plant.<p> 
			
			Houston-based Halliburton said it turned over the new  information to the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission and a French magistrate, and  is turning over evidence to Nigeria officials.<p> 
			
			In a statement, the company said the new information  "appears to relate to conduct that took place almost entirely"  before its 1998 purchase of Dresser Industries Inc., whose M.W.  Kellogg unit was part of the consortium.<p> 
			
			Kellogg later merged with Brown & Root to form Kellogg  Brown & Root, which has a 25 percent stake in TSKJ. Other  members of the Portugal-registered consortium are France's  Technip SA, the Snamprogetti Netherlands affiliate of Italy's  Eni SpA, and Japan's JGC Corp. .<p> 
			
			Halliburton did not immediately return a call seeking  further comment.<p> 
			
			LATEST CHARGES<p> 
			
			The revelations are the latest in a difficult year for  Halliburton.<p> 
			
			Apart from facing questions about its Iraq and Afghanistan  activities, the company last month agreed to pay $7.5 million  to settle SEC charges over its accounting.<p> 
			
			Also in August, the company was accused in a filing in a  shareholder lawsuit of "serial accounting fraud."<p> 
			
			Halliburton shares have nevertheless risen 15 percent in  2004. They closed Wednesday at $29.88, up from $26 at the start  of the year.<p> 
			
			The company has previously disclosed the SEC's formal probe  into payments related to Bonny Island, and well as a Justice  Department probe.<p> 
			
			Published reports have said Jeffrey Tesler, a TSKJ agent,  is under investigation by a French magistrate.<p> 
			
			Halliburton in June severed ties with former KBR Chairman  Jack Stanley, accusing him of receiving "improper personal  benefits" related to TSKJ and Nigeria. Stanley had retired as  chairman in December 2003.<p> 
			
			According to the Journal, Halliburton said its lawyers  discovered notes written between 1993 and 1998 that suggest  consortium executives discussed bribing Nigerian officials to  ensure TSKJ won the plant contract.<p> 
			
			Questions have arisen about whether TSKJ created a $140  million slush fund funneled through Tesler, a British lawyer,  the newspaper said. Tesler declined to discuss his role, and  through his lawyer denied any wrongdoing, it said.<p> 
			
			Eni and JGC were not immediately available for comment.  Technip declined to comment.
