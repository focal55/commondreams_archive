<p>In the black corner, we have the man all China loves to hate - the military strongman, the man seen by some as the king of capitalist corruption and the biggest obstacle to reform, the heavyweight champion of backroom politics. Hiss, boo. 
<p>Yes, it's the former president on the comeback trail - so please give a 1.3 billion-person raspberry to the prince of darkness, Jiaaaaaang Zemin! 

<p>In the red corner, we have the people's hero - the frail, elderly intellectual, the life-saving surgeon, the patriotic whistleblower, the conscience of the nation. Cheers, applause.

<p>Yes, ladies and gentleman, straight from his prison cell, we bring you the upright communist who refuses to stay silent about injustice - so let's hear it for the one and only good doctor, Jiaaaaaang Yanyong! 

<p>It is not often that the opaque world of Beijing's Communist party politics bears comparison to the contrived showmanship of a professional wrestling performance.

<p>However, the Jiang vs Jiang bout - being played out in China, but being broadcast live only to an outside audience - appears to have all the elements of a faux-epic encounter between a morally good but politically weak David and an ethically bankrupt but all-powerful Goliath. 

<p>Nothing, of course, is ever quite what it seems. However, with the bell having just rung on the third round of this intriguing tussle, the contest is looking far less one-sided than political pundits might have suggested just over a year ago.

<p>Then, Dr Jiang - a semi-retired surgeon with the People's Liberation Army - emerged as the unlikely challenger to the most powerful man in China, Jiang (no relation) Zemin, the former president of the nation and current commander of the military. 


<p> The first round came with last summer's Sars crisis, when Dr Jiang caused a political storm by contradicting the government's figures on the number of patients to have been infected by the disease. 

<p>He was not the first to do so, but his medical qualifications, senior rank - equivalent to a major-general - and influential position within the Communist party made his revelations impossible to ignore. 

<p>Soon afterwards, the authorities capitulated. The recognised scale of the epidemic was doubled overnight, and senior heads rolled. The health minister and the mayor of Beijing, both allies of Jiang Zemin, were forced to resign. 

<p>The propaganda ministry - another stronghold of the former president - was in disarray, allowing the domestic media more freedom to report than it had enjoyed at any time during the preceding decade. 

<p>Round two came in February, when the 72-year-old surgeon switched his critical attention to the crackdown on and around Tiananmen Square in 1989. 

<p>Confronting the taboos surrounding this most politically sensitive of subjects, he wrote a letter describing how he had treated the "totally unarmed" students and citizens who were the victims of a "suppression unprecedented in China or the world". 

<p>Calling for the demonstrations to be reviewed as an act of patriotism, he blamed the crackdown on "leaders who supported corruption" - a risky assertion, considering that Jiang Zemin and many others in today's communist leadership were promoted in 1989. 

<p>The letter created an international storm when it was leaked to foreign reporters by an unknown source. Although it has never been published in the domestic media, the well-informed criticism will tarnish the legacy of Jiang Zemin. 

<p>Round three, which finished last week, appears to have been an attempt by the former president to get even. On June 1, three days before the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, Dr Jiang and his wife were picked up by security agents on their way to the US embassy. 

<p>They were among more than a dozen dissidents to be removed from public view prior to this date but, while the others were released within a week, the surgeon was held for 49 days. This would have been impossible without an order from his military boss, Jiang Zemin. 

<p>According to sympathisers, the doctor was made to watch a government-produced documentary that justified the crackdown as a necessary act to quell a rebellion that threatened social order. Daily sessions of "political re-education" were designed to persuade him to change his thinking, and to express remorse for what he had written. 

<p>It was a strange sort of detainment - he was held without charge at an undisclosed location by an unnamed bureau within the government - and has been followed by an equally peculiar form of release. 

<p>Dr Jiang's superiors at the 301 hospital of the People's Liberation Army have forbidden him to talk to the media, and the authorities have indicated that he remains under surveillance. 

<p>The reason for his release also remains unclear, but international pressure was certainly brought to bear by foreign governments and media. Among those who called him to be freed was the US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, who made an appeal on his behalf during a recent Beijing meeting with the foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing. 

<p>However, the government's spin is that the doctor's "political education" was completed when he signed a form admitting that his comments may have been misused by others. 

<p>While the full statement has yet to be released, friends say that he refused to buckle. Instead of directly approving the government crackdown in 1989, he is said to have written, rather ambiguously, that the "Communist party confronted by the student protests was much like a patient with complicated colorectal cancer where, without emergency surgery, death was imminent". 

<p>Everyone is now trying to spin this statement. To communist hardliners, it represents repentance. To several US reporters, it is a show of defiance - but with neither side able to land a convincing knockout blow, it looks more like a drawn round in the Jiang vs Jiang contest. 

<p>Who wins in the end depends on what happens next. Jiang Zemin may be losing on points so far, but, in the short term, that does not matter, because strict domestic media controls mean the vast majority of the Chinese public have no idea that a contest is even taking place. 

<p>With the former president in control of the propaganda ministry, there has been little mention of Dr Jiang since last year - even on the internet, the freest forum for debate. Very few Chinese people will be aware that he was detained for six weeks before being released. 

<p>According to friends, the surgeon is determined to continue his campaign. His next target is said to be the growing Aids crisis in China, which has only recently been recognised by the government. 

<p>As with Sars, the topic allows the doctor to target the old president as well as the health-related shortcomings of market first economic growth. Some of Jiang Zemin's closest supporters are implicated in the decade-long attempt to cover-up the scale of the HIV problem in the worst-affected area, Henan province. 

<p>However, while it is tempting to see the conflict in black and white terms, the reality is far more confused. Dr Jiang appears to be a squeaky-clean hero, but it is unclear whether he is acting alone or on behalf of senior communist officials who would stand to benefit from the demise of the former president. 

<p>With a long history of proxy wars within the party, there is speculation that the current president, Hu Jintao, and the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, are using the surgeon to weaken the power base of their main rival. 

<p>And Jiang Zemin, the apparent villain of the piece, has not always been so harshly criticised by the outside world. 

<p>Although he is a hugely unpopular figure in China, where many view him as a symbol of the growth at all costs economic policy ruining the environment and spawning widespread corruption, it is often forgotten that his measures were largely those recommended by international financial institutions and investors. 

<p>However, it is perhaps a sign of changing times and priorities - as well as an old-fashioned desire to root for the underdog - that means swathes of the global media now champion a patriotic communist doctor against a free market president. All eyes are now on round four.
