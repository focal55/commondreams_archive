NORWICH, Conn. -- Everywhere Rep. Rob Simmons goes these days, he lugs a 2-inch-thick binder. Inside are a summary of an investigation into the Iraq prisoner-abuse scandal and the Army's field manual on interrogation. <P>''When people ask, 'What the hell is going on over there?' I like to read from it,'' says Simmons, a former Army intelligence officer who observed prisoner interrogations in Vietnam. Wednesday, he read a section of the manual on a radio talk show here. <P>''This behavior was not approved or trained'' by the military, he says, showing people in ''black and white'' why he doesn't explain away the military guards' actions. Unlike most of his colleagues in Congress, Simmons, who also spent 10 years as a CIA spy, understands on a personal level how ''very damaging'' the scandal has been to the nation's reputation.<P>Less clear is the damage the scandal, and the mounting violence in Iraq, could do to Simmons' bid for a third term in the House of Representatives. Political analysts say he is one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress this year. His House district in eastern Connecticut is among the most Democratic-leaning ones held by a Republican. In 2000, George W. Bush did worse there than in any of the other 227 House districts controlled by Republicans.<P>Now, as Bush struggles to reverse the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, vulnerable Republicans in competitive districts like Simmons' are starting to worry. Will voters angry about Iraq take it out on them in November? If they do, they could tilt control of the House from Republicans, who hold a 23-seat edge.<P>In Georgia, Rep. Max Burns has said he does not want the United States to pull out of Iraq but to rotate troops who have been there a long time. In North Carolina, Rep. Robin Hayes has called the abuse of Iraqi prisoners ''disgusting'' and ''unacceptable.'' In New Mexico, Rep. Heather Wilson has compared the abuse scandal to the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.<P>But not all vulnerable Republicans are distancing themselves from the Bush administration. In Colorado, Rep. Bob Beauprez has called the obsession with the prisoner-abuse scandal ''political.'' He says the United States must stay in Iraq ''until we win, just like in the Second World War.''<P>House Republicans ''can get tarred if things don't go well'' in Iraq, Republican pollster Frank Luntz says. He considers Simmons' district a bellwether for the nation. Bush's slide in national polls ''creates an emotional drag'' that could ''make Republicans depressed and could have a negative impact on turnout,'' he says.<P>Simmons, 61, isn't shy about criticizing the administration. He says it has ''shown too few signs of wanting to bring about change'' in the intelligence community, which he says is ''still fighting the Cold War, not the new war'' against Islamic extremists.<P> He wonders ''who is taking the heat'' for the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. When asked about Stephen Cambone, the undersecretary of Defense for intelligence who struggled under withering questioning about the prison scandal at recent congressional hearings, Simmons made a slashing motion across his neck in a sign that the official's days at the Pentagon should be numbered.<P>The lawmaker is also putting distance between himself and the White House. Last week, he stayed in Washington while Vice President Cheney spoke to graduates at the Coast Guard Academy in New London. Simmons says his decision wasn't intended as a slight to Cheney. He insists it would have been ''inappropriate'' for him to miss a vote on a defense authorization bill, even though his vote wasn't needed for passage. <P>When asked who he'd like to invite to campaign with him, Simmons mentions Arizona Sen. John McCain, an outspoken Bush critic on several issues. ''We have a lot in common,'' Simmons says. He did ask first lady Laura Bush to visit in March, and she helped raise $100,000 for his campaign. But he doesn't intend to extend a similar invitation to the president.<P>The lawmaker's 30 years in the military and CIA play well in a district that counts more than 80,000 veterans and is home to the Navy's largest submarine base and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. His seat on the House Armed Services Committee and his chairmanship of an important subcommittee on veterans health has helped steer millions in federal funds to the district. ''I deliver the goods,'' Simmons says. <P>Voters here strongly support the troops. Five local National Guard units have been to Iraq. But even among military families, there is growing frustration and anger about the administration's handling of the war.<P>''The people who were really on the fence before aren't anymore,'' says Rich Swanson, 39, a Democrat and a newspaper layout specialist from Waterford who works with several Navy wives. ''I don't know of anyone who supports the war.''<P>Two of Jean Church's 10 children are in the military. One just returned from Iraq; the other leaves in three weeks. ''I don't want to lose a son. It would kill me,'' says Church, 54, of New London. She says Simmons' support for the war makes it less likely she'll vote for him.<P>Likely Democratic challenger Jim Sullivan, a former Norwich city councilman, is making Simmons' support for the administration and Republican House leaders a central issue in his campaign. <P>''Rob Simmons votes like he is George Bush's congressman from Texas and not like your congressman from Connecticut,'' Sullivan told supporters in Groton on Wednesday.<P>Simmons counters that he has one of the most independent voting records of any House Republican, noting that he has parted ways with Bush on such issues as abortion. Sullivan's only chance, he says, is to ''link me with President Bush and call for a clean sweep.''
