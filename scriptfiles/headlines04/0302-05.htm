UNITED NATIONS -- Demetrius Perricos, acting head of the United Nations weapons inspection program, can't disguise his satisfaction that almost a year after the invasion of Iraq, U.S. inspectors have found the same thing that their much-maligned U.N. counterparts did before the war: no banned weapons.
<P>In his first interview since former chief U.S. inspector David Kay announced his conclusion that Iraq had no banned weapons before the war, Perricos said Kay's findings undercut complaints from the Bush administration that the U.N. teams were not aggressive enough to find chemical and biological weapons in Iraq.
<P>U.N. officials with direct knowledge of the weapons search now say U.S. intelligence tips did little to help the prewar search and often produced no results -- or low comedy. In one case, these officials said, U.N. inspectors following a U.S. tip descended in a nighttime raid on what they'd been told was a weapons site disguised as a chicken farm. In fact, they found, the site was just what it looked like: a smelly, messy, working chicken farm.
<P>''For a lot of people who were negative because they didn't know, the impact from David Kay's pronouncement has started them to realize that there was expertise in UNMOVIC, that we were not incompetent,'' said Perricos, who heads the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC). ''The results were the same.''
<P>The vindication of the U.N. inspection effort has led many U.N. diplomats and arms-control experts to call for a larger role for UNMOVIC. The organization exists only to monitor Iraq, even though the United States has yet to allow U.N. inspectors to return there.
<P>''Of all the organizations that were looking at Iraq's weapons capability, the group that got closest to the truth were the U.N. inspectors -- by a long shot,'' said Jon Wolfsthal, a weapons expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
<P>U.S. officials expect no immediate role for UNMOVIC in postwar Iraq but are open to discussions about its future. ''We're not going to abandon UNMOVIC,'' said Richard Grennell, spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations.
<P>Perricos, 68, was in Iraq in November 2002 when U.N. inspections resumed as part of a U.S.-led diplomatic effort to give Iraq a last chance to disarm.
<P>Almost immediately, U.S. officials began to complain that U.N. inspectors were not pushing hard enough. On Feb. 9, 2003, roughly six weeks before the war began, Secretary of State Colin Powell said on ABC's <I>This Week</I> that the administration felt there was no further need for ''inspectors to play detectives or Inspector Clouseau running all over Iraq.'' Clouseau was the bumbling detective played by Peter Sellers in the <I>Pink Panther </I>films.
<P>Perricos said recent U.S. inspections have confirmed what U.N. inspectors believed in early 2003 -- that the chemical and biological weapons and components that Iraq once possessed were destroyed, either by Iraqi officials or U.N. teams, after the 1991 Gulf War. An UNMOVIC report to be released today says Iraq most likely had no banned weapons after 1994.
<P>Perricos' main points in defense of the U.N. inspections in Iraq:
<P><B>  * </B>U.S teams have uncovered little that wasn't found by their U.N. counterparts.
<P><B>  * </B>Intelligence tips from Washington yielded little. A new controversy erupted recently about whether the administration even gave its best intelligence to U.N. inspectors.  Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, says the CIA did not identify 21 of its top 105  sites in Iraq. U.S. officials say the best information was provided.
<P>Perricos would not discuss specific details about what intelligence was provided by the United States or other U.N. members. But other U.N. officials say tips resulted in only three prewar discoveries: documents at an Iraqi scientist's house that were related to Iraq's defunct nuclear program; the discovery of illegally imported SA-2 missile engines; and a farmhouse full of conventional munitions that were not banned by U.N. sanctions.
<P>U.N. officials say inspectors thought they had made a major find when they went to the farmhouse because their detectors found traces of banned substances. The reality: The devices were picking up sulfur from pigeons and their droppings.
