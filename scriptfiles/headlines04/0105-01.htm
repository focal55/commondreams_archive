<p>TIKRIT, Iraq  - The police chief investigating the  deaths of an Iraqi family gunned down in their car in northern  Iraq said on Monday he was convinced U.S. troops were  responsible, although the army has denied involvement.<p> 
			
							Tensions have been rising in Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam  Hussein, since the bodies of the family were found on a nearby  highway on Saturday. Coalition forces said the bodies were of a  man, a woman and a child.<p>

  <!--/endimage/-->General Mazhar Taha al-Ganaim, police chief of Salahaddin  province, said four people were killed -- two men, a woman and  a nine-year-old boy.<p> 
			
							A fifth man who survived and was taken to Tikrit hospital  has told local soldiers the car was fired on by a U.S. Army  convoy. Mazhar said he had interviewed other witnesses and was  "100 percent" sure this was true.<p> 
			
							"The civilian car tried to by-pass the convoy. Because they  tried to by-pass, they (the army) opened fire," Mazhar said,  through an interpreter. The machine gunner on the rear vehicle  of the convoy must have suspected the car posed a threat, he  said.<p> 
			
							The Army's 4th Infantry Division (4ID) which patrols the  area has denied any of its forces were involved in the attack.  But a spokeswoman for the 4ID said other troops could have been  involved.<p> 
			
							"Is there a possibility that this could have happened?  Yes," Major Josslyn Aberle told reporters. "It could have been  someone else passing through our area. It could have been Iraqi  on Iraqi."<p> 
			
							Under normal military rules, if U.S. soldiers open fire  they are supposed to stop and investigate on the spot and  report the incident immediately. No such report has yet been  made, Aberle said.<p> 
			
							Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, the chief military  spokesman in Baghdad, said on Sunday there had been no reports  of any coalition forces firing on anyone or any vehicle in the  area.<p> 
			
							The incident has increased tensions in Tikrit, according to  a U.S. commander in the town.<p> 
			
							"It was definitely more tense yesterday," Lieutenant  Colonel Steven Russell said.<p> 
			
							One of his soldiers was shot in the leg on Sunday as he  patrolled the town, which may be a sign of increased hostility  in a town where anti-U.S. activity has dropped off in the last  few weeks, he said.<p> 
			
							Russell said he had spoken to the local tribal elders and  police heads to express sadness over the incident and tell them  his troops patrolling in the area were flagged down after the  shooting and provided assistance.<p> 
			
							"We went out and talked to several people on the streets,"  Russell said. "I stood before several of the popular  restaurants and said we came to provide assistance and that it  was a sad thing that happened.<p> 
			
							"Whether or not they accepted that, I don't know."
