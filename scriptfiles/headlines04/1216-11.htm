<p>WASHINGTON -- Weather-related disasters in 2004 will cost the global insurance industry more than $35 billion - - a historical record, according to United Nations  and industry officials who spoke Wednesday at an international climate conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

<P>The greatest costs were incurred in the United States where a succession of four hurricanes off the Atlantic and the Caribbean caused more than $26 billion, according to preliminary figures compiled by Munich Re, one of the worlds largest re-insurance companies.

<P>But also hard hit were poor developing countries, particularly in the Caribbean where Hurricane Ivan killed some 28 people in Grenada, caused another $1 billion in losses, destroyed about one third of the island's homes and virtually all of its nutmeg and cocoa crops. Hurricane Jeanne caused massive flooding in Haiti where as many as 2,000 people are believed to have killed.

<P>"Insured losses, driven by weather or climate-related disasters, will amount to more than $30 billion, making 2004 the costliest natural catastrophe year ever for the insurance industry," said Thomas Loster, a senior executive and climate expert with Munich Re, who spoke at the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Buenos Aires.

<P>Loster was one of a large number of climatologists who appealed to the 80 governments assembled at the conference to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists believe to be the cause of global warming trends and the increase in frequent and extreme weather conditions, that have been recorded over the past decade.

<P>"As in 2002 and 2003," he said, "the overall balance of natural catastrophes is again clearly dominated by weather-related disasters - - many of them exceptional and extreme. We need to stop this dangerous experiment humankind is conducting on the Earth's atmosphere."

<P>The conference, which is reviewing the effectiveness of measures taken by nations and the global community to implement the ten-year old Climate Convention and, mapping out what is called the "post-Kyoto agenda" for future steps, also heard Wednesday that 2004 has been the fourth hottest year on record, with last October registered as the warmest October since accurate records were first compiled in 1861.

<P>All four of the hottest years on record have come in the past decade, the hottest year on record is 1998.

<P>Scientists have long predicted on the basis of computer models that the warming of the Earth's atmosphere by increasing greenhouse gases would spawn unusual and extreme weather events that are likely to be more destructive in their impact.

<P>In addition to the strength and intensity of these recent hurricanes in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, climatologists were particularly struck this year by another storm that hit Brazil, Hurricane Catarina, which developed in the South Atlantic where sea surface temperatures are normally much too low to trigger tropical cyclones. It was the first time since global observations began that a hurricane had appeared in the region.

<P>"Climate change is already happening, with rapid melting of the Arctic and glaciers worldwide," said Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the UN Environment Program (UNEP), who is also attending the Buenos Aires conference.

<P>"Climate scientists anticipate an increase and intensity of extreme weather events, and this is what the insurance industry is experiencing, resulting in year-on-year losses," he said.

<P>While the damages in the U.S. were enormous, he noted, "in many developing countries, the impacts of high winds and torrential rains are aggravated by a variety of factors, ranging from the clearing of forests - - making hilly slopes more vulnerable to land slips and slides - - to a lack of enforcement in building codes. Reducing vulnerability and helping poorer nations cope with the ravages of climate change is vital," he said.

<P>As a signatory to the Convention, the U.S. is taking part in the Buenos Aires talks where its status as one of two major industrialized nations that have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol  isolated it from the other delegations.

<P>The 1997 Protocol requires industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions - - caused mainly by the combustion of fossil fuels like coal and oil - - by an average of about six percent below their 1990 levels by the year 2012. Shortly after taking office in 2001, President George W. Bush, whose father signed the Convention, announced that he would oppose any plan that called for emission reductions because of its presumed costs to the U.S. economy.

<P>The chief U.S. delegate to the conference, Undersecretary of State for Global Issues Paula Dobriansky, has repeated that position, insisting that, while Washington now accepts that global warming is taking place, more research needs to be done to determine how best to adapt to it.

<P>"We believe we have a common goal and a common commitment, and that there are multiple strategies to reach that. So I think we're very committed to working with others," Dobriansky said Wednesday.

	 

<P>But adaptation may not be a viable option for many countries in the long run, noted Toepfer. "In the end, many smaller countries, like low-lying small island developing states and countries like Bangladesh, can only adapt for so long before they are eventually overcome by the impacts of storm surges and rising sea levels," he said.

<P>In addition to the hurricanes that hit the Caribbean region this year, a record number of ten typhoons made landfall in Japan, including Typhoon Tokage, one of the strongest ever recorded. Together, they caused economic losses of $10 billion and insured losses of more than $6 billion, according to Munich Re.

<P>Hurricane Ivan was one of the most destructive and strongest storms ever, maintaining a strength of category force four to five on the Saffir-Simpson scale for more than five days. Apart from the destruction it wrought on the islands, the storm also caused serious damage to offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, with total economic losses estimated at as much as $3 billion.

<P>Kendrick Leslie, director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, described Ivan as "a unique event never before seen in the Caribbean. It is believed to be the first in recorded history of a hurricane forming so far south and east of the Antilles."

<P>The more than $1 billion in damages it wrought amounted to twice the island's annual gross domestic product. <p align="center">&copy; 2004 One World US</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
