<p>BAGHDAD -  The story of Yusuf Fakri Amash is the story of so much 
of Fallujah. The 11-year-old boy just managed to escape from the town with his 
family. But not before the U.S. military killed his best friend.
<p>
   "Ahmed was in my class," he says. "He was younger than me. He was 
standing next to the wall of the secondary school and was trying to cross the 
street. He was hit by a bullet. The American troops fired the bullet."
<p>
   So many Fallujahans have been killed by the U.S. marines that residents have 
had to dig mass graves. The city's football stadium now holds more than 200 
bodies.
<p>
   "When you see a child five years old with no head, what can you say?" says a 
doctor in Fallujah whose name is being withheld for his safety. "When you see a 
child with no brain, just an open cavity, what can you say?"

The doctor says many were buried in the football until it became full. "When 
you are burying you cannot stay long because they (the U.S. marines) will just 
shoot you," he says. "So we use the shovel. Just dig a big hole and put a whole 
family in the hole and leave as soon as possible so we are not shot."
<p>
   Filmmaker Julia Guest who traveled to Fallujah in a convoy delivering relief 
supplies told IPS that the clinic's ambulance was fired upon twice by U.S. 
snipers -- during the ceasefire. The second time it was fired on, it was carrying 
U.S. and British citizens who had negotiated an agreement with the marines to 
rescue the injured from an area under heavy U.S. sniper fire.
<p>
   "It has blue sirens," Guest recalls, describing the ambulance. "It's donated by 
the Kingdom of Spain. It was carrying oxygen bottles, and the damage to the 
ambulance was such that two of the wheels were blown off, so they were left 
without an ambulance. And there are bullet holes all over the sides and back 
from the second shooting."
<p>
   The U.S. military does not deny shooting at ambulances. But it blames the 
resistance fighters. U.S. marines spokesperson Lt Eric Knapp says his forces 
have seen fighters loading weapons into ambulances from mosques in the 
area.
<p>
   "By using ambulances, they are putting Iraqis in harm's way by denying them a 
critical component of urgent medical care," he says. "Mosques, ambulances and 
hospitals are protected under Geneva Convention agreements and are not 
targeted by U.S. marines. However, once they are used for the purpose of 
hostile intent toward coalition forces, they lose their protected status and may be 
targeted."
<p>
   Humanitarian aid workers in Fallujah say the marines have been firing 
indiscriminately. Australian aid volunteer Donna Malbun says U.S. forces fired 
warning shots over her head Tuesday when she attempted to enter an 
ambulance to deliver relief supplies.
<p>
   "We were accompanying an ambulance from one part of Fallujah to another 
area that was controlled by the Americans," she says. "And we went along with 
the ambulance, and at one stage got out to indicate to the Americans that we 
were coming through with an ambulance with aid for a clinic that had been cut 
off."
<p>
   They then used a loudspeaker to identify themselves, she says. "We were 
dressed in bright blue medical outfits, and we had our passports in our hands 
with our hands in the air. Then we stepped forward into the street with our hands 
in the air. We were walking down away from where the soldiers were stationed. 
We didn't realize that. And they ended up shooting toward our backs."
<p>
   But it was not just the U.S. Army that caused problems for Donna Malbun and 
her colleagues. She says that on their way out of Fallujah her group was 
stopped by Iraqi Mujahideen fighters who held them for 24 hours. 
<p>
   "They wanted to know who we were at the beginning," Malbun says. "They 
investigated and they asked questions and looked at our belongings, and once 
they realized what we were doing, they treated us with great respect."
<p>
  Donna Malbun says that the delegation was held in a large room and fed well 
during their detention. British aid worker Beth Ann Jones, who was also taken 
captive, says the topic of conversation quickly turned to the U.S. assault on 
Fallujah where the two groups found common ground. 
<p>
   "They would be talking and saying my brother's been killed, my father's been 
killed," she said. "They were telling us details so that we could understand the 
way that they were feeling, and the obvious resentment they were feeling 
towards the occupation. That they were now suffering, and a year ago they were 
promised freedom and liberation from the Saddam regime, and now they're 
living in a situation where they do not have any freedom." 
<p>
   Back in the relative safety of Baghdad, Donna Malbun reflects on her 
temporary captivity. She does not hold any anger towards her captors. 
<p>
   "Fallujah was under siege," she says "and even the women and children who 
wanted to leave today, and the men, couldn't leave. And the bombardment from 
the air was constant, and the sniper activity was constant to the point where they 
were so terrified to leave their houses. These people were being kept captive in 
their own town and country."
