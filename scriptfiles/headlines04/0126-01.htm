<p>MANCHESTER, N.H.   - Democratic presidential  contender John Kerry holds a shrinking three-point lead over  Howard Dean on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, according  to a Reuters/MSNBC/Zogby poll released Monday.<p> 
			
							Dean shaved four points off Kerry's advantage in the latest  three-day tracking poll, as supporters who wavered after his  dismal third-place Iowa finish and screaming concession speech  appeared to be returning to the fold.<p>

  <!--/endimage/-->Kerry led Dean 31 percent to 28 percent in the new poll,  with John Edwards jumping three points to narrowly trail Wesley  Clark for third place, 13 percent to 12 percent. Connecticut  Sen. Joseph Lieberman remained static at 9 percent.<p> 
			
							"There is no question that the race has tightened up,"  pollster John Zogby said. "Dean stopped the bleeding in the  middle of the week and he has slowly regained some of the  support he had lost."<p> 
			
							Dean's favorable ratings crept back up this week but almost  half of likely New Hampshire voters still think it is unlikely  he can beat President Bush -- a crucial issue as Democrats look  ahead to November's general election.<p> 
			
							"There are some serious doubts about whether he can beat  President Bush," Zogby said of Dean, who gained five points in  the new poll while Kerry gained one point and Edwards jumped  three points. The other candidates stayed level.<p> 
			
							A tracking poll combines the results of three consecutive  nights of polling, then drops the first night's results each  time a new night is added. It allows pollsters to record shifts  in voter sentiment as they happen.<p> 
			
							The New Hampshire primary has seen many late momentum  swings and surprise showings through history, sometimes fueled  by the state's large bloc of independent voters, who can cast  ballots in either the Democratic or Republican primary and  traditionally decide late.<p> 
			
							In Monday's poll, undecideds who were leaning toward one  candidate were factored into the totals, leaving three percent  undecided. Without factoring the leaners in the totals, 13  percent of likely New Hampshire voters remain undecided.<p> 
			
							Other polls have shown Kerry with a much wider lead.<p> 
			
							Kerry, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, rolled to  his lead in New Hampshire this week after a surprising comeback  win in Iowa's caucuses that gave his campaign a huge jolt of  momentum.<p> 
			
							Late last month Dean, the former governor of neighboring  Vermont, led polls in New Hampshire by more than 20 points, but  much of his lead evaporated in the week before Iowa and quickly  disappeared after his loss there.<p> 
			
							Clark, the retired general and former NATO commander, is  trying to hold third place despite a charge from Edwards, the  North Carolina senator who finished a strong second in Iowa.<p> 
			
							The poll of 601 likely primary voters was taken Friday  through Sunday and has a margin of error of 4.1 percentage  points. The final poll will be released Tuesday, the day of the  New Hampshire primary.<p> 
			
							Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich received 2 percent in the poll,  with civil rights activist Al Sharpton getting 1 percent.
