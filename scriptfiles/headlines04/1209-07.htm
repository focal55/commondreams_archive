<p>WASHINGTON -- Bernard Kerik, President George W. Bush's nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security, recounts a time 20 years ago when he was expelled from Saudi Arabia amid a power struggle involving the head of a hospital where Kerik helped run the security staff.

<P>In his 2001 memoir "The Lost Son," Kerik described his discomfort at investigating employees' private lives but said it was necessary because of Saudi laws prohibiting drinking and mingling of the sexes in public.

<P>Since he was nominated last week to be homeland security secretary, however, nine former hospital employees have said that Kerik and his colleagues were carrying out the private agenda of hospital administrator Nizar Feteih, and that the surveillance involved people's private affairs.

<P>Feteih used the hospital's security staff to track the private lives of women with whom he was romantically involved and men who came in contact with them, the ex-employees said.

<P>Kerik personally surveilled some employees and confronted them with the results, employees said.

<P>An official Saudi investigation of Feteih and the security team was begun in response to hospital employees' complaints of intimidation by Feteih and the security staff, according to the employees.

<P>Six members of the hospital security staff, including Kerik, were fired and deported, and Feteih was sacked as hospital administrator.

<P>The ex-employees said their allegations shed light on the extent of Kerik's loyalty to superiors. They involve his work from 1982 to 1984 as chief of investigations for the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh.

<P>"Kerik was a goon," said John Jones, a former manager, who said he felt harassed by security men. "They were Gestapo."

<P>"Kerik used heavy-handed tactics in following single men around and keeping them away from some women," said Dr. Ted Bailey.

<P>Added paramedic Michael Queen, "Men and women had to be careful with security, but Bernie was the one we watched out for the most."

<P>Kerik said that he knows of no improprieties by the security staff. Bob Burghardt, who worked with Kerik at the hospital, said he knew of no improper surveillance. "Bernie and I were ostracized for upholding Saudi law," he said.

<P>Kerik is barred from commenting by the Senate confirmation process. Feteih could not be located to comment.

<P>The turmoil began when Feteih took over the hospital in the early 1980s, the former employees said. Previously, administrators at the Saudi government facility allowed men and women on the mostly Western staff to date and drink alcohol if they were discreet. But Feteih had the security staff enforce separation of the sexes when it came to some women, the medical personnel said.

<P>Much of the security staff's attention was trained on women whom Feteih knew well and men who came into contact with them, these people said. "They weren't there to provide security as much as to be a spy network for Feteih," said Dr. William Larkworthy.

<P>"Bernie Kerik was an enforcer" for the head of the security office and for hospital administrator Feteih, Dr. Dan Mackey said. "It was sinister."

<P>Dr. John Froude recalled that in one encounter with Kerik, "he summoned me to his office and slid a piece of paper toward me and said, 'I want you to tell me what is incorrect in this,'" Froude said. "It was an account of how I'd dated some women. I said, 'Besides the spelling errors, it's correct.' He got out of his chair and said, 'Don't get fresh with me, doc.'"

<P>The controversies came to a head in November 1983 when Larkworthy argued with a nurse the morning after he had people over at his home to play bridge and drink homemade wine, said the ex-employees. Several said Feteih intensely disliked Larkworthy and his wife Maria, a nurse, and ordered the security staff to investigate the doctor's behavior.

<P>Feteih sent security men to question William Larkworthy, say hospital documents obtained by The Washington Post. They declared him drunk -- which Larkworthy denies -- and searched his home, finding beer and wine. The security staff handed him over to Saudi security, which former employees said was unique in their experience. Within days, the Larkworthys were deported.

<P>Kerik was a lead investigator on the case, according to the documents. The Larkworthys, Mackey and other former employees said the case was trumped up because of Feteih's dislike of them.

<P>The incident prompted doctors to complain to Ghazi Gosaibi, the minister of health, who began an investigation. Within weeks, Michael Kingston, one doctor who complained, was jailed overnight in what the former employees called an attempt to silence the whistleblowers. Feteih and security men searched for weeks for another whistleblower, a physician, and told employees they intended to place him in a mental hospital, said Bailey, Mackey and two other employees.

<P>The physician was forced to hide before flying back to England, said Bailey, Mackey and other employees. Bailey said that while the physician was under stress and acting oddly, "he did not need to be institutionalized" -- a view echoed by other former employees.

<P>The ex-employees cannot recall Kerik's specific activities during those weeks but say he was part of the effort.

<P>Saudi secret police and a royal panel investigated Feteih and the security staff for months on allegations that included not only improper surveillance but also wiretapping. While they released no report, Saudi officials said then that they concluded that many complaints of Feteih's alleged mismanagement had merit, and he was fired, the ex-employees said. <p align="center"> Copyright &copy; Newsday, Inc.</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
