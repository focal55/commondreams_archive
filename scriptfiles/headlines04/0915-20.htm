<P>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has failed to take sufficient 
steps to protect commercial nuclear plants from terrorist attacks, the U.S. 
Government Accountability Office says.
<P>Although nuclear plants "are no doubt more secure against a terrorist 
attack now than they were on Sept. 11, 2001," the NRC's security improvements 
still haven't resolved plant problems that spawned previously exposed 
embarrassments  --  for example, security guards sleeping on duty and 
falsifying logs, Jim Wells, director of the GAO's natural resources and 
environment division, said in congressional testimony Tuesday.
<P>Wells' remarks to the House Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging 
Threats, and International Relations were also issued in report form by the 
GAO, which was formerly known as the General Accounting Office.
<P>The GAO report upset committee chair Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who 
criticized NRC's sluggishness in implementing post-Sept 11 security reforms. 
People who live near reactors "and those farther downwind take little comfort 
from a cozy, indulgent regulatory process that looks and acts very much like 
business as usual," Shays said in a statement Tuesday. "Findings of security 
violations elicit promises of correction, but little NRC follow-up. Emergency 
response plans (for nuclear disasters) may not be current." 
<P>Wells' comments also suggested a potential conflict of interest in how 
simulations of terrorist attacks are conducted. The potential conflict arises, 
he stated, from the fact the NRC is considering hiring the "terrorist" 
impersonators from a firm that was selected by the nuclear industry's own 
trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, and that already provides 
security guards to half the plants where such exercises are to be conducted. 
<P>"The company's relationship with the (nuclear) industry raises questions 
about the (mock terrorist) force's independence," Wells' report says. The GAO 
report does not identify the company by name, and it could not be determined 
Tuesday. 
<P>Shays concurred: "A proposal to hire an attacking force from the same 
company used to protect several (nuclear) plants raises legitimate concerns 
about the integrity" of future simulated attacks.
<P>Wells also noted that some employees of the same company have been 
suspected of cheating in past tests, according to the GAO report.
<P>"During a June 2003 DOE (U.S. Department of Energy) force-on-force 
exercise (simulated attack) at a nuclear site at Oak Ridge, Tenn., security 
guards working for this company received uncharacteristically high scores," 
the report states. 
<P>Subsequent investigation by the DOE inspector general uncovered the 
possibility that guards might have cheated on tests as far back as the mid-
1980s.
<P>"It was alleged that the guards had studied plans for the simulated 
attacks before they were carried out, had disabled the laser sensors they wore 
during tests to determine when they were 'shot' by mock enemies, arranged 
trucks and other obstacles to help foil simulated attacks, created special, 
nonstandard plans to help them perform better on tests, and put more guards on 
duty at the time of the tests than would normally have been present," Wells 
said.
<P>Officials at the lab, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, couldn't be reached 
for comment.
<P>Wells also said that unidentified NRC officials believe "certain types of 
aircraft hitting (nuclear) facilities at certain locations pose some risks" of 
damaging those facilities.
<P>Earlier this summer, a veteran anti-nuclear group filed a petition with 
the NRC asking it to consider surrounding the nation's nuclear plants with low-
cost arrays of steel girders, mesh netting and cable barriers. Ideally, these 
barriers  --  "Beamhenge shields," an allusion to England's Stonehenge 
monument  --  could destroy an incoming plane before it rammed the plant, says 
the petition filed by the group, the Los Angeles-based Committee to Bridge the 
Gap. The organization, which claims 1,500 members, has opposed the nuclear 
industry since 1979.
<P>NRC chair Nils Diaz addressed the issue Sept. 8 in a letter to U.S. 
Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge. The letter, recently posted at the NRC's 
Web site, assures Ridge that in an aircraft incident, "the likelihood of both 
damaging the reactor core and releasing radioactivity that could affect public 
health and safety is low."
<P>Even if an aircraft managed to damage the plant, the NRC has ways of 
"mitigating" the health and environmental consequences, Diaz added, without 
giving specifics. 
<P>The president of Bridge the Gap, Daniel Hirsch of Santa Cruz, replied 
Tuesday: "The Diaz letter sounds as though it is from the Alfred E. Neuman 
School of Bureaucracy, which takes four pages to say: 'What, me worry?' The 
chairman of the NRC continues to fail to appreciate the era we now live in 
after Sept. 11."
<P>Meanwhile, the NRC has stopped posting an online "scorecard" that rated 
the quality of security at each of the nation's 65 nuclear power plants. The 
scorecard disappeared from NRC's Web site Aug. 4; the agency reiterated its 
decision to drop the site in a statement issued Monday.
<P>That statement quotes Diaz as saying the site was removed to protect 
"public health and safety," because such "sensitive information might be 
misused by those who wish us harm."

<b>FINDINGS:
</b>
<P>Among the concerns raised in congressional testimony by Government 
Accountability Office official Jim Wells:
<P>-- A potential conflict of interest could undermine the credibility of 
exercises designed to test a plant's security, as the NRC is considering 
hiring a mock assault team "trained in terrorist tactics" from a company that 
already provides guards for about half the facilities to be tested.
<P>-- Unidentified NRC officials believe "certain types of aircraft hitting 
(nuclear) facilities at certain locations pose some risks" of damaging those 
plants.However, these same officials believe there would be "sufficient time 
to implement emergency preparedness plans, if necessary," to protect the 
public.
<P>-- The NRC's review of improved security plans "has primarily been a 
paper review" that fails to note vital information such as where guards are 
based and how they would maneuver in case of a terrorist attack.
<P>-- NRC officials "are generally not visiting" the nuclear plants for a 
first-hand look.
<P>-- The NRC is not following up to ensure that previous security 
violations have been corrected or that the resulting lessons learned are 
relayed to officials at other nuclear plants.
