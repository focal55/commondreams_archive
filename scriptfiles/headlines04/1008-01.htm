<p>WASHINGTON  - Sidelined by their failed predictions for Iraq 
and U.S. President George W Bush's efforts to reassure voters he is not a 
warmonger, prominent neo-conservatives and their Christian Right allies are 
nonetheless trying hard to prepare the ground for future U.S. adventures in 
the Middle East.

Echoing increasingly threatening noises from the government of Israeli 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon about preventing Iran from developing a nuclear 
weapon, neo-cons are calling for Washington to undertake covert action, at 
the very least, to oust what some of them call the ''terror masters'' in 
Tehran as part of a more general ''World War IV'' against alleged Arab and 
Islamic extremism.

Some neo-cons are even complaining that if Bush had been serious about the 
''war on terrorism'', he should have taken on Iran after Afghanistan, 
rather than Iraq.
<p>
''Had we seen the war for what it was, we would not have started with Iraq, 
but with Iran, the mother of modern Islamic terrorism, the creator of 
Hezbollah, the ally of al-Qaeda, the sponsor of Zarqawi, the longtime 
sponsor of Fatah and the backbone of Hamas'', wrote part-time Pentagon 
consultant Michael Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) this 
week.
<p>
His article also reprised an argument he first made three years ago -- that 
the Iranian people were already rising up against the mullahs and needed 
only a little nudge from Washington to succeed.
<p>
Neo-conservatives are also busy stoking tensions with Syria, even amid 
indications that Washington and Damascus are feeling their way toward some 
kind of ”modus vivendi” that may even include joint military patrols along 
the latter's porous border with Iraq.
<p>
Last week they heard from a Syrian exile, Farid Ghadry, who apparently 
aspires to become the Ahmed Chalabi -- the neo-con boosted leader of the 
exiled Iraqi National Congress whose standing in Washington plummeted after 
it was alleged he passed secrets to Iran -- of his homeland.
<p>
In addition to lobbying for the pending Syria Liberation Act (SLA), which 
would commit the U.S. government to ''regime change'' in Damascus, Ghadry 
charged that the government of President Bashir Assad was building ''a new 
colony of terrorism'' for youths in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
<p>
The neo-conservatives, who led the charge to war in Iraq, have steadily 
lost influence over U.S. policy in Baghdad since a year ago, when U.S. 
troops found themselves welcomed by a serious and growing insurgency rather 
than the flowers and sweets the neo-cons had predicted.
<p>
At the same time, Bush's top political adviser, Karl Rove, was reported to 
have told unhappy war hawks in the Pentagon and Vice President Dick 
Cheney's office, the two neo-con strongholds, that Bush's re-election 
prospects would be greatly enhanced if there was ''no war in '04''.
<p>
Led by arch-realists Colin Powell and his deputy Richard Armitage, the 
State Department gradually wrested control over policy towards Syria and 
Iran. With U.S. troops bogged down next door, a policy of confrontation, as 
advocated by neo-cons, not only risked another war, the realists argued, 
but could also invite more damaging efforts by both Damascus and Tehran to 
destabilise Iraq.

<p>
Wary engagement with both countries has thus become official policy. The 
recent visit by a high-level U.S. delegation to Damascus and the invitation 
of European and Arab allies and Iraq's neighbours to attend a 
U.S.-sponsored meeting on Iraq in Tehran later this fall mark hard-fought 
advances in the State Department's agenda.
<p>
But while the neo-cons may be down, they are by no means out. As more than 
one foreign-policy analyst has noted, no neo-con within the administration 
has resigned or been fired, despite their responsibility for the Iraqi 
quagmire and public calls by even some senior Republican lawmakers and 
retired military officers that they be ousted.
<p>
Some analysts have argued the neo-cons remain in place only because their 
departure now would amount to an admission by the administration -- and 
thus Bush himself -- that serious mistakes had been made. In this view, 
Bush would purge them in a second term, as he continued along the State 
Department's ''realist'' line.
<p>
But a growing number of observers, particularly in the State Department and 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), are coming to the conclusion that 
the neo-cons may actually enjoy greater influence if Bush wins re-election.
<p>
In just the last few days, for example, an article, 'The State Department's 
Extreme Makeover,' published by online magazine 'Slate' and attributed to 
an ''anonymous'' veteran foreign service officer, made precisely this 
argument.
<p>
It is in this context that neo-cons' recent efforts to focus their fire on 
Syria and Iran, in particular, should be seen.
<p>
Ghadry spoke at an all-day symposium co-sponsored by the <a href="http://www.fightingterror.org/" target="_new">Committee on the 
Present Danger</a> (CPD), a predominantly neo-conservative lobby group set up 
in August, and by the <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/" target="_new">Foundation for Defence of Democracies</a> (FDD), a group 
created two days after the Sep. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and 
the Pentagon, whose views largely mirror those of Israel's ruling Likud Party.
<p>
On FDD's board of advisers are prominent neo-cons and Iraq war boosters, 
including former Defence Policy Board (DPB) chairman and Ledeen's sidekick 
at AEI, Richard Perle; AEI fellow Jeane Kirkpatrick; and former CIA 
Director James Woolsey, who also co-chairs the CPD.
<p>

Joining them are 'Weekly Standard' Editor Bill Kristol, whose own 'Project 
for the New American Century' (PNAC) first named Iran and Syria -- as well 
as Iraq and the Palestinian Authority (PA) -- as targets of the ''war on 
terrorism,'' in an open letter published just 10 days after 9/11.
<p>
The conference was addressed briefly by telephone by former Secretary of 
State George Shultz, the group's new co-chair, while Woolsey announced that 
former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel and former Spanish Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar had agreed to head an international chapter.
<p>
Keynoters for the symposium, titled ''<a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/research_topics/research_topics_show.htm?doc_id=240063" target="_new">World War IV: Why We're Fighting, 
Whom We're Fighting, How We're Fighting</a>'', included Woolsey, who has long 
spoken of the fight against ''Islamo-fascism'' -- defined as including 
''the mullahs of Iran'', the Ba'athist parties of Iraq and Syria, and ''the 
Wahhabis'', of which the al-Qaeda terrorist group is a part -- as the 
equivalent of a world war.
<p>
On hand was Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, whose participation 
appeared not only to provide an official sanction of the radical agenda, 
but also to confirm that the neo-con faction within the Bush administration 
is alive, kicking and unashamed despite the quagmire in Iraq.
<p>
Neo-conservative godfather Norman Podhoretz, who has also used ''World War 
IV'' as his favored description for the challenges Washington faces in the 
Near East, in particular, made a rare public appearance.
<p>
He called Israeli tactics in the occupied territories a ''model for how to 
fight this kind of war'', and asserted that ''Iran is unquestionably on the 
agenda'' of a second Bush administration.
<p>
''I have no doubt that we're going to have to do it and do it fast'', he 
declared, noting there were ''many different instrumentalities'' at 
Washington's disposal for dealing with the mullahs and their nuclear 
program.
<p>
Podhoretz, whose son-in-law Elliott Abrams is the Middle East director on 
the National Security Council (NSC) staff, also offered a sweeping vision 
of what the region might look like when the United States triumphed.
<p>
Stressing the long-held Likud view that the nations of the region were 
artificial creations forged out of the defeated Ottoman Empire, he 
suggested, ''what was done in the aftermath of World War I can be undone in 
World War IV''.

<p>
Two days later, FDD helped convene the <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/research_topics/research_topics_show.htm?doc_id=241175" target="_new">Middle Eastern American Convention 
for Freedom and Democracy</a> to elaborate a foreign policy towards the region 
by several dozen mostly sectarian groups, including the American Coptic 
Association, the American Maronite Union, the Southern Sudanese Voice for 
Freedom, the Assyrian American National Federation, the Chaldean National 
Congress, the American Middle East Christian Association, Jews Indigenous 
to the Middle East and North Africa and the Washington Kurdish Institute.
