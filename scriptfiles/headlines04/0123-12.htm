<p>WASHINGTON   - David Kay stepped down as leader of  the U.S. hunt for banned weapons in Iraq on Friday and said he  did not believe the country had any large stockpiles of  chemical or biological weapons.<p> 
			
In a direct challenge to the Bush administration, which  says its invasion of Iraq was justified by the presence of  illicit arms, Kay told Reuters in a telephone interview he had  concluded there were no Iraqi stockpiles to be found.<p> 
			
"I don't think they existed," Kay said. "What everyone was  talking about is stockpiles produced after the end of the last  (1991) Gulf War, and I don't think there was a large-scale  production program in the nineties," he said.<p>

</table><!--/endimage/-->The CIA announced earlier that former U.N. weapons  inspector Charles Duelfer, who has previously expressed doubts  that unconventional weapons would be found, would succeed Kay  as Washington's chief arms hunter.<p> 
			
Kay said he believes most of what was going to be found in  the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has been  found and that the hunt would become more difficult once  America returned control of the country to the Iraqis.<p> 
			
The United States went to war against Baghdad last year  citing a threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. To  date, no banned arms have been found.<p> 
			
In his annual State of the Union on Tuesday, President Bush  insisted that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had actively  pursued dangerous programs right up to the start of the U.S.  attack in March.<p> 
			
Citing a report to Congress in October, Bush said Kay had  found "dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program  activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq  concealed from the United Nations."<p> 
			
"Had we failed to act," Bush said, "the dictator's weapons  of mass destruction programs would continue to this day."<p> 
			
JURY STILL OUT<p> 
			
And on Wednesday, Vice President Dick Cheney said the  United States had not given up on finding unconventional  weapons in Iraq. "The jury is still out," he said in a radio  interview.<p> 
			
Kay said he left the post due to a "complex set of issues.  It related in part to a reduction in the resource and a change  in focus of ISG," he said referring to the Iraq Survey Group,  which is in charge of the weapons hunt.<p> 
			
ISG analysts were diverted from hunting for weapons of mass  destruction to helping in the fight against the insurgency, Kay  said.<p> 
			
"When I had started out I had made it a condition that ISG  be exclusively focused on WMD, that's no longer so," he said.<p> 
			
"We're not going to find much after June. Once the Iraqis  take complete control of the government it is just almost  impossible to operate in the way that we operate," Kay said.<p> 
			
"I think we have found probably 85 percent of what we're  going to find," he said. "I think the best evidence is that  they did not resume large-scale production and that's what  we're really talking about."<p> 
			
Kay said he was going back to the private sector.<p> 
			
In a statement announcing Kay's departure, CIA Director  George Tenet praised Kay for his "extraordinary service under  dangerous and difficult circumstances."<p> 
			
Duelfer, 51, a former deputy executive chairman of the U.N.  Special Commission that was responsible for dismantling Iraq's  weapons of mass destruction, had previously expressed doubts  that unconventional weapons would be found.<p> 
			
"I think that Mr. Kay and his team have looked very hard. I  think the reason that they haven't found them is they're  probably not there," Duelfer told NBC television earlier this  month.<p> 
			
But in a statement included in the CIA announcement,  Duelfer, who will be based in Iraq and as CIA special adviser  to direct the WMD search, said he was keeping an open mind.<p> 
			
"I'm approaching it with an open mind and am absolutely  committed to following the evidence wherever it takes us," he  said.
