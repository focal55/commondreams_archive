<p>DENVER - The members of The Eagles and their management have a message they want to get out about their upcoming political benefit concert for Ken Salazar - and it's not what you think.</p>

<P>Even though this is a political fund- raiser, it's going to be a night of Eagles music when Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Timothy B. Schmit hit the stage Tuesday at the Fillmore Auditorium. Period.</p>

<P>They believe they've made their political statement by performing at Colorado's only major rock concert surrounding the election. So they want to reassure fans who are buying the $100 tickets that they'll get an enjoyable evening of classic music, not a political screed.

That said, Henley has never backed away from a fight and has often supported political causes. An ailing voice forced the following interview to be conducted via e-mail.</p>
<P><b>&#149;</b> <b>When we spoke last year, you said that until the hysteria died down, there was no point in talking about politics. Things certainly haven't died down. What made you decide to head up this benefit concert now?</b></p>
<P>"We are doing the concert in Denver because we wanted to do our part with regard to the upcoming election. All the members of The Eagles - particularly myself, Glenn and Joe (Walsh, who will be unable to attend) - have close ties to Colorado, . . . and we think that (U.S. Senate candidate Salazar) is an excellent candidate. I have never met Ken Salazar, and I don't believe that any other members of the band have either, but we have certainly done our homework and we like what this man stands for. We are also hoping that our concert will give a boost to the entire ticket on the ballot."</p>
<P><b>&#149;</b> <b>Rather than pursuing big national agendas, you've had a history of doing more local benefit work - Walden Woods and the benefits for Alan Cranston and now Ken Salazar. Do you find it more effective to work on a smaller scale?</b></p>
<P>"We have always found it more effective to target particular candidates in specific regions. . . . Although when and if these men and women do get into national office, they obviously have an effect on the entire nation."</p>
<P><b>&#149;</b> <b>Were you approached to do the Rock for Change tour with Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M., etc.?</b></p>
<P>"Yes, but there was a scheduling conflict because at the time the Rock for Change tour takes place, The Eagles are en route to Asia with all of our equipment. That's why we want to do something in September."</p>
<P><b>&#149;</b> <b>In the past, artists have been able to speak out with little risk, but this year is so divisive that Springsteen and others acknowledge that they'll lose fans but feel compelled to speak out. What is your take on that?</b></p>
<P>"I think that what Springsteen and the others are doing is admirable. I've said this before and I'll say it again: I am first and foremost a citizen, and I didn't give up the rights that citizenship affords me when I became a successful musician and recording artist.</p>
<P>"I am better-educated and more widely traveled than many of the people who hold high legislative office in this country. And I'm certainly as informed and qualified to speak out as most of these windbag pundits who are mouthing off day and night on the airwaves - the publicly owned airwaves, I might add.</p>
<P>"We used to be able to agree to disagree in this country. Our legislatures contained members who were known as statesmen, men who were able to take both sides of an argument and inspire and persuade the opposing parties to come together generally in a compromise that didn't always satisfy everybody but that elevated the common good and moved the country forward.</p>
<P>"Those days appear to be long gone, and we are experiencing a whole new kind of nastiness and gridlock in Washington - a rabid, partisanship that has trickled down to the general populace. Civilized disagreement and debate have become practically impossible.</p>
<P>"It's very disheartening to me. This is probably the most important election of our lifetimes, at least thus far, and a frightening proportion of the electorate seems to be making an emotional judgment on which guy they'd rather have a beer with. We're talking about electing the leader of the free world here."</p>
<P><b>&#149;</b> <b>Because of the controversy, music feels vital again - everyone from John Fogerty to John Mellencamp to the Beastie Boys are doing timely music in response to the world situation. It's the return of the troubadour and social commentary in music. What role has that played in your work over the years (<i>The Last Resort, Dirty Laundry, A Month of Sundays</i>)?</b></p>
<P>"As you say, 'Everyone from Fogerty to Mellencamp to the Beastie Boys \[may be] doing timely music in response to the world situation,' but the question is: Is corporate radio going to play it? Contrary to the myth of the 'liberal media,' and it is a myth, most of the major broadcast media, plus a very healthy portion of the print media, is now in the hands of corporations whose interests lie pretty far to the right of center. I think that radio, in particular - and to some degree, television and print media - want to keep their audiences 'comfortably numb,' to quote my friend Roger Waters.</p>
<P>"The world of radio, which is currently ruled by the powerful Clear Channel conglomerate, is homogenized and centrally programmed. This broadcast behemoth and the other radio chains that swing just below on the ladder don't want to play anything with controversial content unless it's sexual.</p>
<P>"The universal truth remains: Sex sells. And sells and sells and sells. But not politics. No, sir. Not politics, not the environment, not education or health care. No lyrical content, please, about anything that really matters. Let's just have puerile songs about love (or our misunderstanding of it) or macho, blustery diatribes about violence and material possessions or dark, culty-wulty screechy things designed to shock and batter the senses, but no matter what, let's not have anything remotely intelligent or pertinent on the radio.</p>
<P>"I'm sorry if I sound cynical, but I don't exactly believe that 'it's the return of the troubadour and social commentary in music.' To paraphrase the 'tree falling in the forest' riddle, what good is it to write social commentary if nobody hears it? Radio is no longer our partner and so our little stabs at anarchy, or even the most benign social change, do not reach a wide audience. Perhaps the Internet is the answer, but we're just not there yet on a large enough scale."</p>
<P><b>&#149; What's your plan for this concert? One assumes the big Eagles and solo hits will be there, but will you perform any new material or rarities?</b></p>
<P>"I don't think, at least at this point, that there will be any surprises. Frankly, I don't think the audience will want any surprises, even though it's a political concert. I have tried, a few times in the past, to do what I thought were 'meaningful songs' at a 'meaningful event.' It went over like a lead balloon."</p>
<P><b>&#149; What's happening with the new Eagles album? Will it be out this year?</b></p>
<P>"The Eagles album is on hold until next year because The Eagles will be beginning a tour of the Far East - Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, then on to Japan and then down to Australia, where we, I have been told, are breaking box-office records. We return to the states on Dec. 5, and then the holidays are upon us. As for myself, I hope to work on the new Eagles album, as well as a new solo album, in 2005."
