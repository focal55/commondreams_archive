<p>It's just after midday on one of Boston's busiest downtown streets, and Esther Weil is having a serious argument with Ted Lynch. 
<p>Five minutes ago they were strangers, but now they are trading thoughts on whether large US corporations invited into Iraq by the White House, are "reconstructing" the place, or "profiteering" from unfairly awarded contracts.

Esther looks positively grandmotherly in her anorak and is about half Ted's size. He is looking every inch the prosperous registered-Republican. Every few minutes fingers are pointed and tempers are raised, cries of "bullshit" are interspersed with well-worn statistics, tailored to suit whichever viewpoint, on what Americans really think about the war. 
<p>As he is leaving, Ted tells Esther she reminds him of his mother. She returns to the circle of orderly placard-carrying protesters, who have gathered here for an hour, outside the Massachusetts headquarters of one of the companies fingered for having its snout in the Baghdad trough.
<p>Aside from publicizing their ongoing outrage over Iraq, the assortment of progressives gathered here today have also been thinking hard about recent political events closer to home. 
<p>Many of the 30 or so folk trudging around outside 100 Summer Street voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, and now he is back in the race, determined to make his mark on another election - despite the vitriolic condemnation of his presidential aspirations by mainstream Democrats and many former supporters. 
<p>The Democratic establishment say he is doing a "Norma Desmond" as one imaginative columnist described it today. Like the star of Sunset Boulevard, he is unable to face the truth that his fans have moved on. Feeling murderous and self-destructive in equal measure, he has announced through a thick layer of poorly-applied make-up: "I'm ready for my close up now." 
<p>But Nader still has a constituency; even though his policies are remarkably similar to the other left-wing candidate within the Democratic fold, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and even though he will not be buoyed up by Green Party state-based organization this time. 
<p>"He's an American patriot, and his voice in this election is a great plus," says Alan Field, the unofficial organizer of today's rally. He's registered with the Green Rainbow alliance, and they choose their separate nominee for the presidency in the Massachusetts primary next Tuesday, alongside the Democrats.
<p>"If Dennis gets the nomination from the Democrats, I am sure that Ralph will get out of the race," says Pat O'Brien, who until a month ago, was Kucinich campaign state coordinator here. 
<p>Perhaps she doesn't realize how much Ralph likes being back in the limelight again and that he is imploring Democrats everywhere to "relax...rejoice" that he is back.
<p>"There probably is ego involved, but it's the message that's important. He's taken his time getting back in, out of consideration for Dennis," says Pat, somewhat hopefully. 
<p>Some of the protesters are not happy that Nader has returned. Allie Bohm is a Kucinich-supporting student, and like thousands of others, she wrote to Ralph, begging him not to run: 
<p>"He's just dangerous. The higher priority is to centralize all the liberal votes. I have lost a lot of respect for Nader this week and he's ignoring the greater good. Bush has done enough damage in four years. I hate to even think what eight would do." 
<p>Michael Ansell agrees. He's another fresh-faced university student and he likes the sound of John Edwards: "Nader is a great guy, but if he really felt strongly, he wouldn't be hurting the chances of electing a more left-leaning government, like he is now."
<p>Unscientific as it may be, out of the assembled activists, I could not find anyone with a vote who had decided they would be supporting the great consumers' champion and environmental advocate. If there are no firm supporters at an event like this, then Nader is going to be hard-pushed to get enough signatures to be an official presence on the ballot in most states.
<p>The issue of electability, which has loomed over so much of the Democratic primary process, not least for Howard Dean, is still key. Party tacticians know that it's one thing to support Kucinich through a primary he has no realistic chance of winning, but quite another to choose Nader over the Democratic candidate in states like Florida or New Mexico - where just a few hundred votes made the difference last time.
<p>The one man - shuffling his feet in the cold here - who said he would vote Nader if he could, was David Airey. The 45-year old is a Briton, just a few weeks away from security American citizenship, after living near Boston for the past 15 years. Even he sounded reluctant: "I feel divided about Nader. It would be great to break the tight, two-party, corporate-owned society, but at the same time it is so desperate under Bush." 
<p>It is too early to tell whether Nader's involvement in the race is really going to be significant in terms of eroding the collective front against George Bush. Nader himself is arguing that more of his support this time is likely to stem from disgruntled conservatives and libertarians, than newly revitalized Democrats. 
<p>One placard-holder who says he is shying away from giving any individual candidate his support is Rich Cowan. Tying together the anti-corporate message of today's demonstration with the Nader effect, his concern is that the campaign might provide a Trojan horse for unscrupulous Republican business interests:
<p>"There's so much money washing around this election - the president's raised more money than ever before in history. Who is to stop some of these huge corporate contributions being used to fund pro-Nader ads in key states, against Democrats? It's so easy to manipulate the situation."
<p>As the demonstration's end nears, one man carrying a coffee strides through the middle of the placards and halts just before the entrance to 100 Summer Place. He shouts over his shoulder:
<p>"Nuke Iraq, nuke the whole of the Middle East...You're a bunch of traitorous bastards!" 
<p>"Bin Laden works for Bush!" a couple of the rainbow coalition of progressives, shout back. The three police officers who have been keeping an eye on things, gently move in, and it is time to stop. With or without Ralph Nader, America is pumped up for a rough election.
