<p>Same-sex marriage -- considered so radical that mainstream gay 
rights leaders feared its emergence in an election year  --  has gained a 
level of visibility that even its most ardent proponents did not imagine just 
two months ago.
<P>Whether intentional or not, President Bush's pledge in his State of the 
Union address in late January to defend traditional marriage touched off a 
reaction that began in San Francisco and now is rippling across the country.
<P>These marriage licenses  --  whether acts of civil disobedience or 
interpretations of law by local officials  --  are fueling countless 
television images that put a mainstream face on lesbian and gay couples. They 
are laying the groundwork for legal challenges to marriage laws across the 
nation.
<P>And they are infusing gay and lesbian rights with the consciousness of a 
major civil rights movement.
<P>"Gavin Newsom went from being a handsome rookie mayor to an icon on human 
rights, just like that," said Jim Pinkerton, a former political adviser to the 
president's father, President George H.W. Bush. "It does beg comparison to 
other spontaneous citizen movements  --  the sit-ins at lunch counters in the 
South in the '60s, the anti-apartheid movement in the '80s, the Velvet 
Revolution in Czechoslovakia in the late '80s. What's notable is the 
establishment can't really figure out what to do with it."
<P>New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer as much as invited challenges to 
New York marriage laws Wednesday in an opinion on the issuing of marriage 
licenses by the mayor of New Paltz. Spitzer said that while New York does not 
authorize same-sex marriage, its marriage laws "raise important constitutional 
questions involving the equal protection of the laws."
<P>He also said New York should accept as valid such marriages from other 
states. That would include Massachusetts, whose high court ruled that same-sex 
marriages must be granted starting in mid-May.
<P>Few expected things to move as fast as they have, or to spread so far.
<P>Just four years ago, Vermont was embroiled in a fierce debate over 
whether to permit civil unions, a parallel institution short of marriage that 
many considered radical.
<P>Today, Bush's position is that civil unions are acceptable if that is 
what a state wants.
<P>"The fact that civil unions were considered a radical step in 2000 and 
they're now considered nothing more than second class-citizenship by the gay 
community  --  and President Bush is not expressing opposition to civil unions 
--  shows you how dramatically the issue has changed in just a few short 
months," said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force. 
<P>"It's mushroomed in ways we never dreamed possible even two months ago," 
Foreman said. "It was Bush's calling upon Congress (last month) to amend the 
Constitution to forever prohibit the recognition of same-sex marriage that 
propelled the proponents of equal marriage rights into overdrive. We haven't 
seen anything like this across the board in our community since the AIDS 
crisis in the late '80s."
<P>Opponents of same-sex marriage contend it was the November ruling by the 
Massachusetts high court that triggered the current storm.
<P>In fact, the debate began with June's U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 
Lawrence vs. Texas, which struck down state sodomy laws and, for the first 
time, ruled that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to private 
sexual relationships. 
<P>Conservatives contend the judiciary will inevitably strike down 
traditional marriage definitions in state laws and constitutions, and 
eventually the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act. The act defines marriages 
as a union of a man and a woman, preventing same-sex couples from obtaining 
federal benefits tied to marriage, such as Social Security payments and 
immigration rights. It also allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex 
marriage rights from other states.
<P>The federal act has yet to be challenged because until now same-sex 
marriage did not exist in the United States. Some lawyers said recent 
marriages in Portland, Ore., may be the first valid marriages permitting such 
challenges, and certainly Massachusetts marriages will.
<P>Gay rights advocates and opponents agree it is only a matter of time 
before laws against same-sex marriage go the way of laws against interracial 
marriage, barring a constitutional amendment.
<P>But Republican members of Congress privately concede there is little 
chance that amendments under consideration can pass the difficult threshold of 
two-thirds approval in both houses, and they are wrestling with alternatives. 
The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday scheduled its first hearing for 
March 30, but the wording of an amendment remains undecided. 
<P>"We're seeing an incredibly fast-paced civil rights movement and what I 
think is the last-gasp backlash of the radical right that has been in the gay-
bashing industry for decades," said Patrick Guerriero, executive director of 
the gay Log Cabin Republicans. "This is an unstoppable train."
<P>Guerriero speculated the White House underestimated the opposition to an 
amendment among Republicans, many of whom say the issue should be left to the 
states.
<P>"You've got your biggest, highest-profile Republicans in the country 
right now  --  (California governor) Arnold Schwarzenegger and (former New 
York mayor) Rudy Giuliani  --  both coming out against an amendment," 
Guerriero said.
<P>David Horowitz, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, 
said Bush "has allowed himself to focus on the wrong target," which is a 
constitutional amendment defining marriage, rather than an amendment that 
prevents judges from making laws.
<P>"Things are getting out of control when every mayor and public official 
feels free to interpret the constitution and issue rules that run pretty 
clearly contrary to state law," Horowitz said.
<P>Pinkerton, however, said the White House hasn't been hurt by the debate. 
"An amendment doesn't have to pass. It's like abortion. The right-to-lifers 
have been flaying away for 30 years and never notice that they don't win. The 
Republicans get their energy and the right-to-lifers never get a victory. You 
get the energy out of a political movement by losing, not by winning."
