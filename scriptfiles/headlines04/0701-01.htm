<p>A defiant and unrepentant Saddam Hussein appeared in court to hear a string of charges for which he could face the death penalty, in a landmark moment for the new Iraq.</p>
<p>A visibly tired Saddam defended his August 1990 invasion of Kuwait and refused to sign legal papers after seven charges were read against him, an official of the Iraqi Special Tribunal said.</p>

Insisting he was still president of Iraq during the 30-minute hearing, the ousted dictator, speaking in a hoarse voice, questioned the jurisdiction of the tribunal.</p>
<p>"This is all a theatre. The real villain is Bush," said a thin-looking Saddam, referring to US President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old former strongman also insulted Kuwait. "How could you defend those dogs?" he asked, only to be rebuked by the judge that "such language is not permitted" in a court of law.</p>
<p>The toppled dictator was transported to the courtroom in an armored bus flanked by four Humvees and an ambulance after flown there in a helicopter.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, he was led handcuffed and with a chain around his waist into the building by two Iraqi prison guards, while six more guards stood to attention at the door.</p>
<p>The handcuffs and chains were taken off before he stepped into the courtroom. Saddam, who has lost weight since his capture in December but sported a tidier beard, was dressed in a dark outfit.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Saddam looked around and made hand gestures at the judge as charges were read out against him that included the invasion of Kuwait and bloody suppression of an uprising by Iraq's Shiite majority in 1991.</p>
<p>"Kuwait is an Iraqi territory. It was not an invasion," Saddam declared according to a tribunal official who attended the hearing.</p>
<p>Before the hearing ended, Saddam was presented with a document to sign to acknowledge that he understood what was going on, understood the charges and that his rights had been read, but he refused to sign it.</p>
<p>Saddam's defense team, which has not yet been allowed to enter Iraq, on Thursday again slammed as "illegal" the Iraqi Special Tribunal trying the deposed dictator.</p>
<p>"This court is illegal since it was designated by an illegal authority, created by the occupation," one of the lawyers, Jordanian Ziad Khassawneh, said in Amman.</p>
<p>Minutes after Saddam left the courtroom, his former presidential secretary Abed Hamid Mahmud was brought in.</p>
<p>Ten other top members of the former regime were due to follow including former deputy prime minister Tareq Aziz and Saddam's first cousin "Chemical" Ali Hassan al-Majid.</p>
<p>Officials said videotape of the ex-president in court would be carefully checked before they are released to the public.</p>
<p>The faces of those involved, except for Saddam and 11 former aides who are due to appear later in the day, will be obscured to guard against any attacks by supporters of the disgraced despot.</p>
<p>The footage will be the public's first glimpse of Saddam since footage was released of a bearded and disheveled former strongman after his arrest by American troops.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Malek Dohan al-Hassan said Saddam would be condemned to death if found guilty. The death sentence -- suspended by the US-led coalition  -- was restored after Monday's sovereignty handover to an interim government.</p>
<p>Thursday's hearing began what is likely to be a tortuous and protracted process to apportion blame for the numerous atrocities committed in Iraq during Saddam's 24-year reign.</p>
<p>Majid, nicknamed Chemical Ali for the 1988 gassing of the Kurds, and ex-vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan are among Saddam's former chief aides who will also be read their charges on Thursday.</p>
<p>Former defense minister Sultan Hashim Ahmed, who was rumored to have collaborated with the US military during the invasion in spring 2003, was also named in a tribunal statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They have been held under tight security at Camp Cropper, a US military detention center at Baghdad's former international airport, according to a humanitarian organization.</p>
<p>They will remain guarded by multinational forces who fear a jailbreak if they are handed over to Iraqi custody.</p>
