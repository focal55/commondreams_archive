<p>TORONTO  - A majority of Canadians hope President
Bush loses the upcoming election and do not really care who
beats him, according to a magazine poll that hit newsstands
Wednesday.
<p>
 In <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/politics/article.jsp?content=20040209_74911_74911" target="_new">an article</a> entitled "Canadians to Bush: Hope you lose,
eh," Maclean's magazine said a national survey found only 15
percent of Canadians would definitely vote for Bush if given
the opportunity.
<p>
 Forty percent said they would definitely vote for someone
else, while 28 percent said they would consider choosing
someone other than Bush. Seventeen percent said they did not
know.
<p>
 "Despite a spate of polls showing a broad desire for
improved relations with the United States after the often rocky
(former Prime Minister Jean) Chretien years, there is a sense
that this administration isn't one we want to do business
with," the newsmagazine said.
<p>
 Forty-three percent said Canada is worse off with Bush as
president than during the terms of previous U.S. presidents,
while 12 percent said the country is better off and 33 percent
said there is no difference.
<p>
 Relations between the two neighbors have been strained
recently by a slew of factors including, most prominently,
Canada's refusal to join the U.S.-led war on Iraq.
<p>
 New Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin has focused on
mending ties between the two countries, which have the world's
biggest trading relationship. But the poll suggests that while
Canadians want better relations with Americans, they are less
enthused about closer ties with their president.
<p>
 Fifty percent of respondents said they either extremely or
somewhat disliked Bush, while 32 percent said they somewhat or
extremely liked him.
<p>
 "Clearly, there is something about George W. Bush that gets
under the skin of Canadians," Maclean's wrote. "After all,
vehemently disagreeing with the policies of American presidents
is almost a national pastime.
<p>
 "There has to be another explanation for our extreme
reaction, the desire afoot in the land to see him turfed from
office. That and the unprintable sentiment about him and the
horse he rode in on."
<p>
 The magazine attributed that, in part, to Canadians'
paranoia about being overwhelmed by their giant neighbor and
discomfit with Washington's policies to protect U.S. interests
abroad, with or without the support of international bodies
such as the United Nations.
<p>
 The survey of 1,367 Canadians was conducted between Jan. 20
and Jan. 25 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
