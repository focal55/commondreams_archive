<p>WASHINGTON  - President Bush  has an unlikely ally
in his effort to show that he did his National Guard duty
during the Vietnam War: the often political and frequently
irreverent "Doonesbury" comic strip.
<p>

      The 'Doonesbury' comic strip is offering $10,000 to anyone who can show President Bush served in the Alabama Air National Guard. Readers are referred to the Web site doonesbury.com, where a Witness Registration Form asks for online testimony. The site says the prize money is being underwritten by Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau. Bush is shown in his Texas Air National Guard uniform in this file photo from the 1968-73 period.

<!--/endimage/-->The strip is offering &#36;10,000 to anyone who can show Bush
served in the Alabama Air National Guard.
<p>
 "That's right -- we're offering &#36;10,000 cash to anyone who
can prove George W. Bush fulfilled his Guard duty in Alabama,"
Wednesday's strip said. "So if you served with Mr. Bush -- even
if only in the officers' club -- we want to hear from you right
now!"
<p>
 Readers are referred to the Web site <a href="http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/bush_guard.html" target="_new">doonesbury.com</a>, where
a Witness Registration Form asks for online testimony. The site
says the prize money is being underwritten by Doonesbury
creator Garry Trudeau. "Thanks to Bush's massive tax cuts for
people who don't need them, GBT is flush."
<p>
 The hitch is the winner will not actually receive the
reward. Instead the Web site says the cash will be donated in
the winner's name to the United Service Organization (USO),
which entertains American troops.
<p>
 The strip first offered the reward on Monday and already
there are hundreds of responses, according to David Stanford,
duty officer at the online Doonesbury Town Hall.
<p>
 "We're only in day three and have already received witness
forms from over 600 contestants, with more streaming in every
hour," Stanford said in an e-mail response to questions.
<p>
 "We'll be carefully processing all of them, but what's
immediately striking is that so many who've plunged into the
depths of their 1972 memories have surfaced with accounts that
involve automobiles, alcohol, aliens, secret ops and Elvis,"
Stanford said.
<p>
 The White House had no comment on the contest, but
Christine Iverson of the Republican National Committee  said
laughingly, "It sounds like a stunt worthy of a comic strip."
<p>
 Documents released earlier this month offered no new
evidence to show that Bush actually turned up for National
Guard duty in Alabama during the latter part of 1972, a period
when Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe has
accused him of being absent without leave.</p>
