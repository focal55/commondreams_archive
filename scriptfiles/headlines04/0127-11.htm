<p>MANCHESTER, N.H.  - John Kerry took firm command  of the Democratic presidential race with a big win over Howard  Dean in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, cementing his  grip on the front-runner's role and dealing another setback to  Dean's reeling campaign.<p> 
			
							Kerry, the Massachusetts senator whose come-from-behind win  in the Iowa caucuses last week turned the 2004 presidential  race upside down, scored his second consecutive victory in the  race to pick a Democratic challenger to President Bush.<p> 
			
							"I have only just begun to fight," Kerry told cheering  supporters in a downtown Manchester hotel, urging them to  "stand with us" on a drive to evict Bush from the White House.<p> 
			
							With about 89 percent of precincts reporting, Kerry had a  39 percent to 26 percent lead over Dean, sending him into next  week's crucial round of seven Democratic state contests on a  huge wave of momentum.<p> 
			
							In a key battle for third-place bragging rights ahead of  next week's contests, retired Gen. Wesley Clark narrowly led  North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, 13 percent to 12 percent,  with Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman at 9 percent. All three  said they would go on with their campaigns.<p> 
			
							The loss was the latest in a series of setbacks for Dean,  whose high-flying campaign stalled on a dismal third-place  showing in Iowa, a widely ridiculed concession speech and  growing voter doubts about his ability to beat Bush in  November.<p> 
			
							But Dean, who had canceled television ads in other states  to focus his resources on New Hampshire, called the finish "a  solid second" and said he was pleased.<p> 
			
							"The people of New Hampshire have allowed our campaign to  regain its momentum," Dean, who saw a 20-point lead in New  Hampshire polls disappear in a month, told roaring supporters  in Manchester.<p> 
			
							"The only way to beat George Bush is to stand up to him all  the time, not just when it's convenient," said Dean, who  charged to the top of the Democratic pack last year on the  basis of his strong denunciations of Bush, the Iraq war and the  Democrats in Washington who supported it.<p> 
			
							Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran who has made a special  pitch to veterans, looked to be going nowhere a month ago. But  he has stressed his war and foreign policy experience on the  campaign trail, driving home the message that he can challenge  Bush on traditional Republican issues like security.<p> 
			
							"We're a little older and a little grayer," Kerry said of  the "veteran's brigade" he has formed to support his bid. "But  we still know how to fight for our country."<p> 
			
							The win for Kerry completed his transformation into the  Democratic front-runner, a title he has resisted since Iowa and  one that will likely make him the target of fresh attacks from  his rivals in the race and Bush's Republican supporters.<p> 
			
							About 200,000 voters, a new Democratic primary record,  turned out in New Hampshire, the tiny state famous for surprise  finishes and a fondness for political underdogs.<p> 
			
							OUTCOME CRUCIAL FOR ALL<p> 
			
							In the battle for third, Edwards, Clark and Lieberman all  hoped a strong showing would propel them on to breakthrough  wins in later contests. Despite Clark's slim lead over Edwards,  Lieberman called it "a three-way split decision for third."<p> 
			
							Edwards, who scored a strong second-place finish in Iowa,  said his showing was good enough to provide a boost heading  into next week's must-win race in South Carolina, where he was  born.<p> 
			
							He noted Clark skipped Iowa to concentrate on New Hampshire  "so if I'm ahead of him at all or we're in the same ballpark,  that's a great victory for me."<p> 
			
							Clark, who has been criticized for his past votes for  Republicans, told supporters "when we take on George Bush this  fall, we want everyone to join us, no matter where you're from,  what your background is or what your party registration might  say."<p> 
			
							The voting in New Hampshire, coming one week after Iowa's  kick-off caucuses, ends the first phase of intensive,  person-to-person campaigning as the race spreads across the  country next Tuesday with contests in seven states, where  candidates switch their emphasis from building momentum to  rounding up the delegates needed to win the Democratic  nomination.<p> 
			
							New Hampshire will send 22 pledged delegates to the  Democratic convention this summer, fewer than all but one of  the seven states with contests on Feb. 3. Early projections  showed Kerry picking up 14 delegates in New Hampshire and Dean  getting the other eight.<p> 
			
							Kerry will head to Missouri on Wednesday, the biggest prize  next Tuesday with 74 pledged delegates. Dean will return to his  home in Burlington, Vermont, for a day before heading to South  Carolina on Thursday to campaign and participate in a debate.<p> 
			
							Edwards will hit South Carolina, the first primary in the  South and a must-win state for him, Oklahoma and Missouri on  Wednesday. Clark travels to South Carolina.<p> 
			
							Bush also is on the ballot in New Hampshire in a Republican  primary in which he faces no major opposition.<p><i>Additional  reporting by Patricia Wilson, John Crawley, Chris Wilson, Mark  Egan, Ellen Wulfhorst</i><p>
