A large march against the weekend meeting of 21 leaders of  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum turned violent when  a few dozen youths broke away from the main group to attack  police.<p> 
			
			About 100 people were arrested and four were injured,  police said.<p> 
			
			President Bush arrived late Friday for a visit that has  been a lightning rod for protests.<p> 
			
			Tens of thousands of people streamed through central  Santiago carrying banners and chanting slogans against the  U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, including "Fascist Bush is a  terrorist."<p> 
			
			The area hit by the violence was small and had no effect on  pre-summit bilateral talks between APEC leaders, including  Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's President Hu  Jintao. All 21 leaders meet Saturday and Sunday.<p> 
			
			Ministers paving the way for the weekend meeting have  discussed ways to revive global trade talks launched in Doha  three years ago. Cooperation against international terrorism is  also on the agenda, at the urging of countries including the  United States and Russia.<p> 
			
			The nuclear arms programs of North Korea, one of few  Asian-Pacific countries not part of APEC, will be one of the  main security topics in bilateral meetings such as Hu's talks  with South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun Friday and the Hu-Bush  summit Saturday.<p> 
			
			'MUTUAL DISTRUST'<p> 
			
			"Everyone is very clear that the extreme mutual distrust  between the two major parties -- the U.S. and the DPRK (North  Korea) -- is the biggest barrier" to resolving a two-year-old  impasse, said Chinese foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan.<p> 
			
			China's Hu has taken advantage of his South American trip  to guarantee supplies of key commodities for his booming  economy. He launched free-trade talks with Chile, the world's  largest copper exporter, and agreed to begin work on a  market-opening pact with New Zealand.<p> 
			
			China also promised investments during Hu's visits to  soy-producing Brazil and Argentina.<p> 
			
			Police estimated the number of marchers at 25,000, but  protest leaders said the real number was 70,000.<p> 
			
			"The turnout is much bigger than we'd expected. This is a  polite response to Bush's barbarity," said Ernesto Medina, a  march organizer.<p> 
			
			APEC officials were far away in their hotels or in a  convention center overlooking the foothills of the Andes on the  outskirts of Santiago.<p> 
			
			Protest organizers from leftist, indigenous and  environmental groups said the rights of workers and the need to  protect the environment were being ignored in the free-trade  agreements promoted by APEC members.<p> 
			
			A violent minority pulled shirts over their faces and  started throwing rocks when the march ended in Santiago's  Bustamante park. They smashed park benches and burned a U.S.  flag.<p> 
			
			Police doused them with water cannons and fired tear gas  from armored vehicles at protesters who dodged behind trees.<p> 
			
			Chile's government canceled all police leave and decreed a  public holiday in Santiago Friday as part of the strict  security.
