<p>LOS ANGELES - Voters in the Los Angeles suburb of
Inglewood on Tuesday rejected by a 2-1 margin a ballot measure
that would have allowed Wal-Mart to build a sprawling shopping
center in the heart of their town.

In voting down the referendum, residents appeared to have
taken their cue from elected officials in working-class
Inglewood, who fought bitterly to keep Wal-Mart from building a
supercenter there, despite the promise of 1,200 jobs and
millions of dollars in sales tax revenue.
<p>
 "This was a major victory," said Jerome Horton, a state
assemblyman representing Inglewood. "This was a test site for
Wal-Mart. This would have set a national precedent and
developers all over the nation were watching to see whether or
not a developer could exempt themselves from complying with
local laws. This was a much bigger issue than just jobs."
<p>
Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott downplayed the
vote in an interview with Reuters following a Little Rock
Chamber of Commerce meeting in Arkansas on Wednesday.
<p>
 "It's a single store," he said. "We have lost votes on
single stores before, and I would assume in the future we will
have some we lose."
<p>
 With all 29 precincts reporting, election returns showed
33.8 percent of voters in favor of Measure 04-A and 66.1
percent opposed. Some 3,000 absentee ballots remained
uncounted, but a spokeswoman for the Inglewood city clerk said
those votes were unlikely to change the result.
<p>
 The Inglewood City Council had prompted Wal-Mart to appeal
to the voters by passing a law to thwart the world's largest
retailer and its "big-box" shopping center -- which would have
occupied a plot of land the size of 17 football fields -- on
the grounds that it would put local mom-and-pop stores out of
business and pay lower wages to its employees.
<p>
 Wal-Mart officials said the opposition to their supercenter
was driven by labor unions, who saw the discount retailer as a
threat and contributed heavily to Inglewood officials'
campaigns.
<p>
 They said the proposed supercenter exceeded city planning
standards and would have provided badly needed jobs and
low-priced goods to the city, whose residents are mostly black
and Hispanic.
<p>
 Opponents of Measure 04-A, who included four of Inglewood's
five council members as well as religious leaders, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, said the
ballot initiative was a bid by Wal-Mart to bully its way past
the city's democratic review process.
<p>
 They had vowed to fight the shopping center in court if
Measure 04-A passed.
<p>
 But Mayor Roosevelt Dorn, one of the few Inglewood
officials supporting the measure, said opponents were turning
away 1,200 jobs and an estimated &#36;5 million in sales tax
revenue and criticized outsiders such as Jackson for
interfering in the city's business.
<p>
 "He's a hired gun who comes in here to tell us not to pass
the measure," Dorn told local KCAL-TV. "He didn't bring any
jobs. He didn't bring any sales tax revenue. He just brought
himself."
