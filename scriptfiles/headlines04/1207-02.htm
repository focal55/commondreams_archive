<p>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina - 

The United States
showed no signs of budging in its opposition to the Kyoto
protocol Monday as U.N. climate change talks began, a month
after President Bush's reelection and Russia's ratification of
the agreement.

The U.S. government said it had "chosen a different path"
from Kyoto, but vowed to work against global warming by slowing
greenhouse gas emissions, investing in climate science and
technology and cooperating internationally.
<p>
 Bush withdrew in 2001 from the 128-nation Kyoto protocol,
which seeks to cut carbon dioxide emissions by five percent
from 1990 levels by 2012. He argued it was too expensive and
wrongly excluded developing nations.
<p>
 Of the large industrialized countries, only the United
States and Australia have refused to join the U.N. effort. But
they account for around one-third of global emissions. The
Australian government says ratifying Kyoto would hike power
prices and cost the country jobs.
<p>
 Scientists predict the rise in temperatures will accelerate
melting glaciers and polar ice caps, leading to a rise in sea
levels, extreme weather like heat waves, the spread of tropical
diseases and the collapse of forests, coral reefs and farming.
<p>
 "Efforts to address climate change will only be sustainable
if they also serve a larger purpose of fostering prosperity and
well-being for citizens around the globe," Harlan Watson,
alternate head of the U.S. delegation, told the Buenos Aires
conference to the parties, known as COP 10.
<p>
 Russia's ratification has created the most optimistic mood
in years among environmentalists since it allows Kyoto to go
into effect in February with a seven-year delay.
<p>

 KYOTO ENTERS INTO FORCE
<p>
 "The fact that the Kyoto protocol enters into force really
gives much more strength to this debate," Joke Waller-Hunter,
executive secretary for the U.N. framework convention on
climate change, told Reuters.
<p>
 No major targets are expected from Buenos Aires. Rather, it
is an opportunity for countries to begin discussing a timetable
to define how much climate change the world can handle.
<p>
 The conference has drawn 6,000 delegates from 194
countries, and environmental ministers from 80 countries will
meet in the final days of COP 10, from Dec. 15-17.
<p>
 But the United States' refusal to sign hangs over the
12-day meeting.
<p>
 "It is a fantasy to try to mitigate climate change without
the participation of the United States," said Juan Carlos
Villalonga, director of campaigns at Greenpeace Argentina.
<p>
 Miguel Rementeria, an Argentine environmental activist,
said he harbors no hopes of a shift in U.S. policy.
<p>

 "The big businesses that back Bush don't want it (Kyoto)
and that won't change," Rementeria said.
<p>
 To drive home the point of climatic changes, Greenpeace
built a giant ark on Buenos Aires' main avenue where some 2,000
people lined up Monday to take temporary refuge.
<p>
 But even Kyoto's backers say its provisions are not enough
to reverse global warming and it is essential to get developing
nations -- notably China, India and Brazil -- on board.
<p>
 The Buenos Aires talks will touch on the participation of
these countries in curbing emissions after Kyoto runs out in
2012. China, now an industrial powerhouse, is the second
biggest producer of emissions behind the United States but is
much lower on a per capita basis.
<p>
The European Union  and some environmental groups want to
limit any global temperature rise to 2.0 Celsius (3.6F).
Temperatures have risen by 0.6 C since the late 1800s.
