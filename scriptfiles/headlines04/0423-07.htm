JERUSALEM  - Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said on Friday he was no longer bound by a pledge he gave President Bush not to harm Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. "I said during in our first meeting about three years ago that I accepted his request not to harm Arafat physically," Sharon told Israel's Channel 2. "But I am released from this commitment. I release myself from this commitment regarding Arafat."
<p> 
Sharon said he told this to Bush last week during a meeting with him at the White House, where he received U.S. approval for his plan to unilaterally evacuate all settlements from the Gaza Strip and some in the West Bank.
<p> 
Sharon gave no indication that any move against Arafat was imminent. Although the United States does not acknowledge the Palestinian leader, Washington is opposed to Israel killing him.
<p> 
Shortly after Sharon's comments, the State Department said it stood by its opposition to the assassination of Arafat.
<p> 
"Nothing has changed in the U.S. position and I will look at the statement and see what we have to say," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
<p> 
An advisor for Arafat, Nabil Abu Rdainah, said Sharon's statement would lead to increased tensions in the region.
<p> 
"We reject Sharon's statement and demand clarification from Mr. Bush on such a statement and hold Sharon responsible for such a dangerous statement," he said. "This is an escalation and will lead to increased tensions."
<p> 
Sharon's tough talk could go down well among members of his right-wing Likud party who will vote on his Gaza withdrawal plan on May 2.
<p> 
Sharon's televised comments expanded on similar remarks he made in a newspaper interview several weeks ago.
