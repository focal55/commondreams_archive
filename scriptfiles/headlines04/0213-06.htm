<p>WATERVILLE -- Walter Cronkite would put President Bush in the hot seat today if he had his pick of interview subjects, and he would ask more questions than Tim Russert did in MSNBC's Meet The Press interview last Sunday with Bush. <p>"Sunday's interview was very well done," Cronkite said. "I'm a great admirer of Russert, and he did the best in the time he had. But some questions were left unanswered."<p>How Cronkite would grill Bush may never be heard, lost between the lines as Cronkite went on to field other prepared questions by students and academics in his hour-long phone interview with a Thomas College journalism class Thursday. The class is taught by Sandor Polster, who spent a third of his journalism career working with Cronkite and arranged Thursday's interview. Cronkite spoke from his New York office. <p>Cronkite's 18 years as the anchor of CBS' Evening News is regarded as a benchmark in broadcast journalism for the high level of public trust vested in his reports. Even now, Cronkite said he would not consider public office for fear that it may taint his legacy of apolitical reporting.<p>In a wide-ranging conversation Thursday that ranged over U.S. foreign policy and Cronkite's assessment of modern broadcast news, the 87-year-old icon gave a qualified thumbs-up to technological improvements in news reporting and drew sobering parallels between Bush's Iraq campaign and the Vietnam War.<p>"In one sense, we have a far better ability to broadcast live, as we found during the Iraq war, and that's been applied to more peaceful pursuits in political and diplomatic moves," he said. "Unfortunately, there's not enough coverage of the important news of the day, and far too much coverage of the trivial." <p>Even in retirement, Cronkite is not dismissive of modern politics or the media, though he derided cable talk shows for masquerading opinions as news.<p>"Some of political theater is in the very nature of democracy itself, like the debates in the Democratic primary season," he said. <p>"It allows us to see the candidates, to hear them respond to questions unrehearsed. But if political theater includes their attacks on each other, you could wish for a more sophisticated address to the problem."<p>But in a barbed appraisal, Cronkite warned that the American presence in Iraq strongly resembled its adventure in Vietnam at the height of Cronkite's career.<p>"I see a very close parallel," he said. "I don't find any real substance in the argument that there's no parallel, which is what the administration would like. They don't want to have us believe that there is some kind of maelstrom. I'm not saying Iraq is hopeless, but at the present moment, we are facing an intensifying guerrilla war, and it is taking a great deal of our people and treasury." <p>Reporting from Vietnam in 1968, Cronkite had forecast a stalemate to the U.S. campaign.<p>But with no other student picking up on what he might ask President Bush in an interview, Cronkite's tough questions may never see the light of day. <p>Marien Madore, the Thomas College senior who popped the question on who Cronkite might interview, tried to ask the follow-up but could not get it answered before others jumped in. <p>"I wanted to know what the press is not asking, what we are missing," she later said. "But it was still an honor to sit down with Walter Cronkite. Sandy (Polster) gave us a great opportunity."<p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2004 Blethen Maine Newspapers Inc.</p>
