<p>NEW YORK  - When Pete Seeger was recording songs
like "Wimoweh" with the Weavers folk quartet in the 1950s, he
didn't give much thought to the fact the people who originally
created the music generally got nothing in return.
<p>
 Now Seeger is lending his name to the Campaign for Public
Domain Reform, an effort to create a system for part of the
royalties from folk tunes to reach the corners of the world
where the songs originated.

If anyone in the music world has the moral authority to
spearhead such a cause, it's Seeger, who just turned 85.
 <p>
 In a performing career spanning more than six decades,
Seeger was as likely to turn up at union halls, peace marches
and picket lines as in large concert halls or on television. He
wrote or coauthored such anthems as "If I Had a Hammer," "Where
Have All the Flowers Gone?" and "Turn! Turn! Turn!" and he
adapted and arranged other standards including "We Shall
Overcome" and "Guantanamera."
 <p>
 "When a song is in the public domain and you record it,
it's standard practice in the music industry to say 'adapted
and arranged by' whoever sings it," Seeger said in a recent
interview. "Why let the record company keep all the royalties?
They didn't write the song."
 <p>
 But who did? The answer isn't always clear. Seeger said he
was once told by Joseph Shabalala of the South African vocal
group Ladysmith Black Mambazo that when the word "traditional"
is used, "it means the money stays in New York."
 <p>
 A RELUCTANT SUCCESS
 <p>
 "I didn't want to become a famous person," Seeger told
Reuters from his home in Beacon, New York, overlooking the
Hudson River. "I didn't want to become rich. My wife and I were
quite content to live on a few pennies here on the side of a
mountain."
 <p>
 The success of the Weavers following World War II took him
by surprise, he said. The group's 1949 recording of Leadbelly's
song "Goodnight Irene" sold 2 million copies, and the group
also popularized such songs as "On Top of Old Smoky," "Kisses
Sweeter than Wine" and "This Land Is Your Land."
 <p>
 But when Red hunters of the McCarthy era caught wind of the
political views and associations of some members of the
Weavers, the group was blacklisted -- banned from the airwaves
and blocked from performing in most mainstream venues.
 <p>
 In 1955 Seeger was hauled before the House Un-American
Activities Committee, where he refused to say whether he had
performed for Communist-sponsored events.
 <p>
 "I have sung in hobo jungles, and I have sung for the
Rockefellers, and I am proud that I have never refused to sing
for anybody," he told the committee.
 <p>
 His defiance earned him a one-year prison sentence for
contempt of Congress -- later overturned on appeal -- and a
hero's place in the hearts of a generation of progressives and
peace activists. Attending a Seeger concert became a political
event in itself.
 <p>
 Seeger dropped out of the Weavers after a few years. "I
just don't like singing in nightclubs," he said. "I don't
drink, I don't smoke and I don't drink coffee. But I really
wanted to help the peace movement and the union movement and
the civil rights movement."
 <p>
 Seeger said he now hopes to revise some of the
autobiographical writings he published in years past.
 <p>
 "Now I can be more frank -- how I was once in the Communist
Party," he said. "That was a little difficult 30 years ago. And
I can also be more frank about other mistakes I made."
 <p>
 Seeger said he long ago turned over his share of the
royalties from "Wimoweh" to Solomon Linda, the Zulu choral
leader who first recorded the song as "Mbube" in 1939. But he
said he was unhappy that Linda and his family received nothing
after the song found new life as "The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"
first as a chart-topping hit by the Tokens in 1961 and later in
the hit movie and Broadway musical "The Lion King."

 <p>
 But then, Seeger said, he realized he was equally guilty
for taking an old song called "Abiyoyo" from a book of African
folk tunes. The song came from the Xhosa people of South
Africa. "I'd been doing it for 50 years and never sent any
money to anybody," Seeger said.
<p>
THE POWER OF SMALL THINGS
<p>
To help set things right, his publisher is working out an
arrangement to send half the royalties from the song to a
nonprofit organization that funds scholarships for Xhosa
children.
<p>
Seeger has stopped touring and appearing in concerts on his
own -- mainly because he says his voice is gone, though
otherwise he seems as spry as ever, keeping up a full slate of
chores like shoveling gravel and making his own maple syrup.
<p>
He still likes to lead audiences in song, as he did on a
recent evening in midtown Manhattan, playing his banjo and
teaching a group of political activists the chorus to what he
calls his "best new song" -- a syncopated tribute to
nonviolence called "Take It from Dr. King." The number is
included on a two-CD set of songs by Seeger and friends called
"Seeds: The Songs of Pete Seeger, Volume 3" (<a href="http://www.appleseedrec.com/" target="_new">Appleseed
Recordings</a>).
<p>
Much of Seeger's effort in recent years has gone toward
cleaning up the Hudson River and improving the waterfront in
his hometown.
<p>
"I'm still trying to do some little things," he said. "If
there's a human race here in a hundred years, it won't be any
big thing that will save it -- a big slogan, a big movement, a
big organization of any kind. It'll be saved by literally
hundreds of millions of little things going on.
<p>
"There are more good little things being done in America
now than at any time in history. Big things can be destroyed.
The powers that be are so powerful they can destroy any single
thing they want. But what are they going to do about millions
of things?"</p>
