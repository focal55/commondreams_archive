<p> KIRKUK, Iraq - Attacks in Iraq like the Arbil  suicide bombings show efforts to build a new Iraq are  succeeding and that extremists are using violence to stop the  process, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said on  Monday.<p> 
			
							"The most discouraging news in the last couple of the days  is the bombing in Arbil," said Wolfowitz, who is on his third  trip to Iraq since the war ended last April.<p> 
			
							"They took advantage of the Muslim holiday when people  relaxed," he said, referring to the Eid al-Adha feast.<p> 
			
							Sixty-seven people were killed in Sunday's coordinated  bombings.<p> 
			
							The attacks, the worst since a suicide car bomb killed more  than 80 outside a mosque in the holy city of Najaf in August,  killed several senior members of the main Kurdish parties --  the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic  Party.<p> 
			
							Wolfowitz, who is gauging security five months before a  planned transfer of power to Iraqis, told reporters traveling  with him that both parties had relaxed their usual security  practices because of the holiday.<p> 
			
							Early reports suggested the suicide bombers apparently  posed as journalists, Wolfowitz said.<p> 
			
							He predicted that these types of attacks would ultimately  unite Iraqis against the violent extremists.<p> 
			
							"September 11 had united Americans, and Bali united  Indonesians and this terrible thing is going to unite Iraqis,  It's not going to have the effect the terrorists seem to want,"  Wolfowitz said.<p> 
			
							"The targets aren't just Americans, the targets are Kurds  and Shi'ites, and anyone who is cooperating to build this new  Iraq, he said. "And the more successful we are the more we can  expect them to go after those things that represent success.  But we're gaining ground and they're losing ground."<p> 
			
							Major General Ray Odierno, the commander of the U.S. 4th  Infantry Division in northern Iraq, said he had noticed a shift  in the type of attacks.<p> 
			
							Assailants were using bigger improvised explosive devices  "to make a bigger statement" as well as increasing their  targeting of Iraqi police and civilians, Odierno said.<p> 
			
							Wolfowitz spent the day in the northern cities of Mosul and  Kirkuk, meeting U.S. military commanders, touring a police  station and speaking to local officials.<p> 
			
							In Mosul, assailants attacked a Stryker armored vehicle  with a rocket-propelled grenade several km (miles) away from  where Wolfowitz was touring the city center.<p> 
			
							He and his party had been traveling in Stryker armored  vehicles so they could observe how they operated.<p> 
			
							U.S. military officers did not believe the attack was  linked to Wolfowitz's visit.<p> 
			
							Wolfowitz, asked about the Stryker attack, said: "It's  pretty hard to visit a division around here on a day when they  are not attacked."<p> 
			
							Wolfowitz last visited Iraq in October when assailants  attacked the hotel where he was staying with rocket-propelled  grenades, killing one U.S. soldier and wounding more than 15  people.<p align="CENTER">Copyright 2004 Reuters Ltd<p>
