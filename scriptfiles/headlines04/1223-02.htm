<p>WASHINGTON  - The United States is facing
increasingly deadly attacks in Iraq because, as in the Vietnam
war, it failed to honestly assess facts on the ground,
according to a new think tank report.

The report, prepared by Anthony Cordesman, senior fellow of
the <a href="http://www.csis.org/" target="_new">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a>, said
administration spokesmen had appeared to live "in a
fantasyland" when giving accounts of events in Iraq.
 <p>
 Cordesman, a former Pentagon  official who has made several
trips to Iraq, said Iraqi spies were a serious threat to U.S.
operations and that there was no evidence insurgent numbers
were declining despite vigorous U.S. and Iraqi counterattacks.
 <p>
 The report(<a href="http://www.csis.org/features/iraq_deviraqinsurgency.pdf" target="_new">.pdf</a>) was updated after Tuesday's attack on a U.S.
base in Mosul which killed 22 people. Defense officials said
the explosion was apparently caused by a suicide bomber,
underscoring the problem of infiltrators in U.S. operations.
 <p>
 After the 2003 invasion to oust Saddam Hussein, the United
States "assumed that it was dealing with a limited number of
insurgents that coalition forces would defeat well before the
election" of a new Iraqi government, Cordesman asserted.
 <p>

 "It did not see the threat level that would emerge if it
did not provide jobs or pensions for Iraqi career officers or
co-opt them into the nation-building effort. ... It acted as if
it had years to rebuild Iraq using its own plans, rather than
months to shape the climate in which Iraqis could do it," he
said.
 <p>
 Cordesman said in the first year of the U.S. occupation,
Washington "failed to come to grips with the Iraqi insurgency
... in virtually every important dimension."
 <p>
 NO HONEST ASSESSMENT
 <p>
 Under the heading "Denial as a method of counter-insurgency
warfare," the report accused the United States of minimizing
the insurgent and criminal threat in Iraq and of exaggerating
popular support for U.S. and coalition efforts.
 <p>
 Washington "in short ... failed to honestly assess the
facts on the ground in a manner reminiscent of Vietnam,"
Cordesman wrote.
 <p>
 He said that as late as July 2004, administration spokesmen
still lived "in a fantasyland in terms of their public
announcements," including putting the core insurgent force at
5,000 individuals when experts in Iraq knew the correct number
to be 12,000 to 16,000.
 <p>
 As in most insurgencies, including Vietnam, sympathizers
within the Iraqi government and Iraqi forces, as well as Iraqis
working for the coalition, media and non-governmental
organizations, "often provided excellent human intelligence
(about U.S. and coalition operations) without violently taking
part in the insurgency," the report said.
 <p>

 Cordesman said U.S. attempts to vet these Iraqis cannot
solve the problem because "it seems likely that family, clan
and ethnic loyalties have made many supposedly loyal Iraqis
become at least part-time sources."
 <p>
 Since early 2004, insurgents have suffered tactical defeats
in Baghdad, Falluja and elsewhere. Still, "there is no evidence
that the number of insurgents is declining as a result of
coalition and Iraqi attacks to date," Cordesman said.
 <p>
 U.S. troops left Vietnam in 1973 after the war lost support
at home. Many Americans became disenchanted with their
government's failure to tell the truth about U.S. operations in
Vietnam and about casualty levels.
