      <p>WASHINGTON - A group of widows of September 11 victims slammed President 
        George W. Bush 's record against terrorism, accusing the US leader of 
        making the United States less safe and of bringing terrorism to Iraq. 
      <p> &quot;He has made us less secure,&quot; said Monica Gabrielle, a member 
        of the widows' group, which is supporting Democratic White House hopeful 
        John Kerry in the November 2 election. 
      <p>
 

&quot;There are many things that have not been done here at home which could have been,&quot; she said in a telephone conference with reporters. &quot;This president had three years with the Republican Congress to get so much more done to make us safer.&quot;

 <p>
 

Gabrielle decried what she called Bush's &quot;stubborn arrogance.&quot;
 <p>
 

&quot;How can we trust you to lead us in the future when you have failed so poorly in the past?&quot; asked another widow, Mindy Kleinberg.
 <p>
 

&quot;Now we brought the terrorism to Iraq,&quot; said a third widow, Lorie Van Auken. &quot;The terrorists that we create today may come back to attack our children tomorrow.&quot;
 <p>
 

The group endorsed Kerry last month and decried Bush's response to the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
