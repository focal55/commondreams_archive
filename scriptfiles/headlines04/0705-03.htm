<p>LONDON  - 

Gay Pride marches are mainstream in some
countries and gay politicians, actors and pop stars are out and
proud -- but homophobia is growing across the world with
increasing numbers of countries making it punishable by death.
<p>
 A new book published by human rights group Amnesty
International says despite widespread acceptance of gays and
lesbians in some countries, violent persecution of homosexuals
is on the rise and has reached "epidemic" levels in others.
<p>
 "Lesbian and gay people who form or join organizations, be
they political or social, are being violently persecuted in
many parts of the world where before they might have been
unnoticed," writes the book's British author Vanessa Baird.
<p>
She singles out Uganda, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, El Salvador  and
Latin America in particular, where she says "the targeting and
killing of transgender people has become an epidemic on
streets."
<p>
 The book, "Sex, Love and Homophobia," offers an overview of
the experiences of gay, lesbian and transgender people around
the world and gives a snapshot of their status in various
societies today.
<p>
 One British gay man interviewed describes how he was
subjected to "aversion therapy" as a teenager in the 1960s
because his mother could not accept her son was gay.
<p>
 "I was locked up alone in a mental institution for 72 hours
with supposedly gay pornography and given drugs to make me
vomit and become incontinent," he said. "They said the next
part of the treatment was to apply electrodes to my genitals.
After three days I begged to be let out."
<p>
 In the United States, Baird notes an increasing
polarization of attitudes. "While San Francisco boasts the
largest openly gay community of any city in the world,
anti-homosexual movements in Kansas, Ohio and Colorado advocate
as a 'Christian duty' the rejection, and in some cases even
killing, of gay people."
<p>
 "And this is not all just a small group of nutters in the
mid-West," she told Reuters. "This kind of evangelism is
growing, and unfortunately a substantial part of it is
homophobic and says homosexuality is a sin or a disease."
<p>
 Baird's book also focuses on countries where homosexuality
is punishable by death -- Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan,
Mauritania, Sudan, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Yemen and
northern provinces of Nigeria.
<p>
 Baird quotes Iran's 1991 Islamic penal law, which states
"sodomy is a crime" and "punishment is death if the
participants are adults, of sound mind and consenting."
<p>
 South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu uses a foreword to
the book to condemn homophobia as "every bit as unjust as that
crime against humanity, apartheid."
<p>
 "I could not have fought against the discrimination of
apartheid and not also fight against the discrimination
homosexuals endure," he wrote.
<p>
 South Africa became the first country in the world in 1996
to include a clause in its constitution to guarantee freedom
from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
