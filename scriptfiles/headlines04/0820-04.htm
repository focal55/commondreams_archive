<p>MONTREAL - Sarah Bardwell did not get the names of the four FBI agents and 
two police officers who questioned her and her roommates late 
on the afternoon of Jul. 22 on the front porch of their house in 
Denver. ''We asked them for their names and they said they 
wouldn't give us their names because we wouldn't give them 
ours.''
<p>
''They told us they were doing pre-emptive investigations into 
possible -- I think their exact words were 'terrorists, anarchists 
and murderers'. Then they specified (it was about people) that 
may be planning actions for the RNC or the DNC,'' she says in a 
telephone interview from her house.
<p>
   The Republican National Convention (RNC) will be held later 
this month to officially nominate U.S. President George W Bush 
as candidate for November's presidential election. The 
Democratic National Convention (DNC) took place in July, 
nominating Senator John Kerry.

After about 25 minutes of a mixture of aggressive and then 
chummy questioning of Bardwell and her roommates, the six 
officers left, after warning the group that they would be making 
''more intrusive efforts'' to find the information they were seeking.
<p>
   According to media reports this week, Bardwell is one of 
possibly dozens of protesters that FBI agents have questioned 
in recent weeks, an act that has provoked peals of protest 
country-wide from those who say the visits violate the freedoms 
guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.
<p>
   They also raise the question of whether the Bush 
administration is creating a ''climate of fear'' that is seeping 
beyond the Muslim and Arab communities that were scrutinized 
by security agencies after the Sep. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on 
New York and Washington.
<p>
   Yes, says the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). ''I think 
(the visits to protesters) definitely contributes to a climate of fear 
and intimidation,'' says Emily Whitfield, the New York-based 
group's director of media relations.
<p>
   News of the interrogations come weeks before the Republican 
Party is slated to officially nominate Bush at the RNC in New 
York City, an event that protesters have been planning for 
months to disrupt. Authorities have been plotting their security 
response for just as long, with the New York Police Department, 
for example, working with the Secret Service for the past 18 
months.
<p>
   On Tuesday, three members of Congress wrote to the Justice 
Department asking it to probe the FBI visits, calling them 
''systematic political harassment and intimidation of legitimate 
anti-war protests,'' reported the 'New York Times'.
<p>
   In a statement, FBI Assistant Director Cassandra M Chandler 
responded that the agency ''is not monitoring groups or 
interviewing individuals unless we receive intelligence that such 
individuals or groups may be planning violent and disruptive 
criminal activity or have knowledge of such activity.''
<p>
   ''The F.B.I. conducted interviews, within the bounds of the U.S. 
Constitution, in order to determine the validity of the threat 
information,'' she added.
<p>
   But Bardwell, an intern at the American Friends Service 
Committee who calls herself a social justice activist says neither 
she nor her roommates were planning to attend either 
convention. In February 2003, Bardwell helped organize local 
anti-war protests.
<p>
   ''We hadn't even been following it; I didn't even know when it 
was going to happen. I think (the FBI is) basically just justifying 
violating people's first amendment rights (of freedom of religion, 
speech and assembly),'' she adds.
<p>
   The ACLU warned of a climate of fear following the 9/11 
attacks after the FBI in 2001 and 2002 questioned 8,000 
Muslims and Arabs in the United States. ''All public accounts 
indicate that the questioning did not yield apprehension of a 
single terrorist,'' said the group in a statement.
<p>
   Two weeks ago, the ACLU said it was joining up with lawyers 
around the country to provide free legal advice to any Muslim or 
Arab-Americans caught up in a new round of questioning by the 
FBI, announced earlier this year.
<p>
   ''These types of FBI tactics are counterproductive. They 
produce fear and resentment, not results,'' said Dalia Hashad, 
the ACLU's Arab, Muslim and South Asian advocate.
<p>
   ''Fear has two sides of the same coin,'' says James Brochin, a 
lawyer and teacher who has studied periods in U.S. history 
when authorities curtailed civil liberties.
<p>
   ''One is the fear of communists (in the 1950s crackdown 
known as 'McCarthyism') or terrorism. And the other side is the 
fear of one's neighbor and the fear of the consequences of 
saying stuff out loud that would sound like you're sympathetic to 
these threatening elements. So it's both the fear of communism 
(or terrorism) and the fear of our own government,'' adds 
Brochin.
<p>
   ''Those two things, both, result in a loss of freedom. One is a 
self-censorship and the other is either enforcement of existing 
laws or creation of new laws that actually do result in intrusion 
into our privacy or create situations where loyalty oaths -- either 
metaphoric or actual -- are imposed on the general public,'' he 
says.
<p>
   According to Samuel Walker, a professor in the department of 
criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, ''there is 
(today) a general climate of fear and there are specific abuses'' 
by authorities against civil liberties.
<p>
   He singles out provisions of the USA Patriot Act, passed in 
response to the 9/11 attacks, which permit security agencies to 
access medical or library records without a subpoena or a 
warrant.
<p>
   But Walker stresses that ''the Bush administration has been 
challenged in every conceivable forum ... there are more cases 
than I can keep track of. The Supreme Court decisions are very 
important,'' he tells IPS.
<p>
   In June the court ruled that foreign prisoners of Washington's 
"war on terrorism" held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba have the right 
to contest their detention in Federal Court and that U.S. citizens 
held as ''enemy combatants'' were entitled to full due-process 
rights.
<p>
   The ACLU launched another challenge Thursday, arguing the 
administration should not be able to use secret evidence to 
defend against a suit from a number of groups that oppose the 
Patriot Act's powers to access private records and to use 
''national security letters'' to obtain personal information from 
Internet service providers and other businesses without judicial 
oversight.
<p>
   Walker is optimistic that the attack on civil liberties could be 
quickly stopped if Kerry were to win the Nov. 2 election.
<p>
   Whitfield says the public is joining ACLU's fight against the 
administration's squeezing of civil liberties since 9/11. While the 
number of new members to the group increased by fewer than 
1,000 people from 1999 to 2000, it soared by more than 14,000 
from 2000 to 2001, by more than 19,000 the following year and 
by more than 52,000 from 2002 to 2003.
<p>
   During the same period, donations to ACLU via the World Wide 
Web jumped nearly 10-fold, from more than 187,000 dollars in 
1999 to 1.6 million dollars in 2003, she added.
<p>
   Yet a poll released Wednesday by the Council on Foreign 
Relations found that almost twice as many U.S. citizens were 
concerned the government had not done enough to guarantee 
their safety than were worried about undue restrictions on civil 
liberties.
<p>
   Bardwell also believes the administration has a duty to protect 
citizens. "The government obviously has an obligation to protect 
people. That's very clear to me. But I think what's happening is 
not protection for the people of the United States; I think it's 
protection of a corrupt government.''</p>
