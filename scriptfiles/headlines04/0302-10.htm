UKIAH, Calif. —  Els Cooperrider, who owns an organic restaurant and brewery here, decided she had  had enough when she could find only genetically modified canola oil for sale.</p>
<P>
Ms. Cooperrider, a retired scientist who lives in a cabin with no electricity or telephone, began circulating a county ballot measure that if approved on Tuesday would be the nation's first ban on growing genetically modified foodstuffs and animals.</p>
<P>
The proposal, called Measure H, would prohibit the growing and raising of "genetically modified organisms" here in Mendocino County, a rural area some 80 miles north of San Francisco where farming is a $180 million-a-year business.</p>
<P>
Genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.'s, are plants and animals that have had their DNA altered, sometimes by the insertion of genes from other varieties or species, to achieve what the growers consider an improved product.  The agricultural biotechnology industry  has put up $525,000 to fight Measure H.  Proponents have raised $80,000.</p>
<P>
"We've got to have G.M.O.-free zones or we're not going to have organic products anymore,"  Ms. Cooperrider said.</p>
<P>
Joined by organic farmers and other county residents, she hopes to block genetically modified crops before they are planted because  drifting pollen could contaminate other crops and wild plants.   </p>
<P>
Communities in Vermont have passed resolutions opposing genetically modified foods. Last year, a statewide initiative in Oregon that would have required the labeling of G.M.O.'s was defeated. Residents  of  Humboldt County, north of here, are collecting signatures for a ban.</p>
<P>
Americans eat genetically modified snacks and sweets, and much of the nation's sweet corn, soybeans and canola are genetically modified. Ms. Cooperrider and her allies say that little is known about the long-term effects of such foods. </p>
<P>
"If you no longer completely trust in government and corporations and their lobbyists," said Don Schmitt of the Apple Farm, which grows "heirloom apples" grafted from older varieties, "then you should vote yes."</p>
<P>
Mindful of their neighbors, those here who favor the use of G.M.O's tend to be reserved in their advocacy. The county's Farm Bureau opposes Measure H "because it's poorly written," the bureau's president, Peter Bradford, said. With many of its members organic farmers, though, the group has sidestepped the substance of the debate.</p>
<P>
Mr. Bradford said that bans like Measure H should be a matter for the state or federal government, but that this county rarely yields to a higher authority. The sheriff backs medical marijuana use. The district attorney served jail time  for failing to file tax returns. The organic food co-op sells 15 kinds of bulk granola.</p>
<P>
Grapes are the county's No. 1 crop — aside from marijuana, so plentiful that in his report on Measure H, the county's agricultural commissioner, David Bengston, said, "Illegal crops such as marijuana pose very unique special problems in enforcing, should such an ordinance be enacted." </p>
<P>
Martina Newell-McGloughlin, director of the University of California's systemwide biotechnology research and education program, said genetically altered organisms were safe. "We have been modifying food crops for 10,000 years," she said.</p>
<P>
But last month an advisory group to the National Academy of Sciences said that researchers must do a better job of confining the organisms to prevent the passage of traits to wild relatives or other species.</p>
<P>
Backed by an industry lobbying group, CropLife America, opponents of Measure H have more than a six-to-one spending advantage, though that might not work to their favor.</p>
<P>
Deborah Cahn and Ted Bennett of Navarro Vineyards first opposed a  ban because it seemed like an unwarranted assault on science. They changed their minds when corporate contributions created what they felt was a lopsided debate.</p>
<P>
County Supervisor David Colfax  said:     "It's a David and Goliath kind of an issue.  And in this county, David wins more often than not."</p>
