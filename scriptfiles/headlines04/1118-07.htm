<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>NEW YORK -- An Iraqi freelance journalist working for Al Arabiya television and Associated Press has been detained by U.S. troops in Fallouja since last week, the New York-based <a href="http://www.cpj.org/" target="_new">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> said Wednesday.

<p>The U.S. military said it was not aware of any such detention.

<p>Citing another Al Arabiya correspondent as its source, the group said the Arabic satellite station lost contact with Abdel Kader Saadi, a reporter and photographer living and working in the Sunni Muslim city, on Nov. 11.

<p>U.S. forces launched a massive assault on Fallouja last week. U.S. artillery was still pounding the city Wednesday as troops hunted remaining guerrillas, days after Washington said its offensive had ended rebel control.

<p>The committee quoted Al Arabiya as saying Saadi had been detained in a mosque along with several other civilians. He had been wearing a flak jacket with the word "press" on it in Arabic and English.

<p>"Saadi should be released immediately," said Ann Cooper, the group's executive director. "The U.S. military has no basis to continue holding Saadi, who was clearly working as a journalist at the time he was detained."

<p>Lt. Col. Joe Yoswa, a Defense Department spokesman, said the military had no information on such an incident.

<p>"We are unaware of any journalist being detained by U.S. forces during combat operations in Fallouja, or any request from news media about missing journalists in Fallouja," he said.
