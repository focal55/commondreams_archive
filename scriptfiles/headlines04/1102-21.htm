	BAGHDAD - The U.S. military said Tuesday a  cameraman killed in the Iraqi city of Ramadi while on  assignment for Reuters had died in a gunbattle between Marines  and insurgents.
<P>
"Marines from the 1st Marine Division of the I Marine  Expeditionary Force engaged several insurgents in a brief small  arms firefight that killed an individual who was carrying a  video camera earlier Monday morning," it said in a statement.
<P>
It was the military's first response to questions from  Reuters about the killing.
<P>
Video footage of the incident showed no apparent fighting  and no sounds of shooting in the vicinity before Dhia Najim was  killed by a single bullet. He filmed heavy clashes between  Marines and insurgents earlier in the day but that fighting had  subsided.
<P>
Najim's colleagues and family said they believed he had  been shot by a U.S. sniper.
<P>
Reuters Global Managing Editor David Schlesinger said: "We  reject the clear implication in the Marines' statement that  Dhia was part of an insurgent group.
<P>
"This claim is not supported by the available evidence. I  strongly urge the U.S. military to conduct a proper  investigation into this tragic event."
<P>
The cameraman was near his house in the Sunni Muslim city's  Andalus district when he was hit by a single bullet in the back  of the neck that killed him instantly.
<P>

Video shot from an upper floor of a building nearby shows  Najim, at first half-hidden by a wall, move into the open. As  soon as he emerges, a powerful gunshot cracks out and he falls  to the ground, his arms outstretched.
<P>
Civilians are seen gathering calmly at the scene  immediately afterwards to look at his lifeless body.
<P>
Marine snipers are posted in Ramadi, news photographs taken  Sunday show. 
<p>
State Department spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters in  Washington Monday that officials were "deeply disturbed" by  deaths of journalists in Iraq, including Najim's. "We  rededicate ourselves now to providing an environment in which  the free press can do its work," he said.
<P>
Ereli was commenting on a spate of attacks on journalists  in Iraq, including a bomb attack on Al Arabiya television at  the weekend which killed seven people. He was speaking before  the Marines' statement.
<P>
The military statement said: "Identification badges found  on the dead man confirmed employment with a major news agency.
<P>
"Inspection of videotape in the camera revealed footage of  previous attacks on Multi-National Force military vehicles that  included the insurgent use of RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),  an IED (roadside bomb) and small arms fire."
<P>
It was not immediately clear how the U.S. military had been  able to view the tape in Najim's camera or check his identity  cards. Reuters has asked for the camera to be returned. "The  insurgents fled the scene with their wounded but left the body  of the dead man along the side of the road," the military  statement said.
<P>
Najim, who left a wife, three daughters and a son, worked  freelance, supplying occasional material to Reuters Television.  He was born in 1957.
<P>
The last footage received by Reuters from him Monday was  shot from behind a red metal container in a dusty street. It  shows U.S. Humvee vehicles speeding across an intersection amid  flashes from gunfire and explosions.
<P>
Marines are gearing up for an expected offensive against  insurgents and Islamist militants in Ramadi and Falluja as part  of efforts to pacify Iraq before elections in January.
<P>

Ramadi, 110 km (68 miles) west of Baghdad, lies in mainly  Sunni central Iraq where anti-U.S. sentiment runs high.
