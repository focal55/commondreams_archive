MADRID  - Hundreds of thousands took to streets  across the world on Saturday to demand the withdrawal of  U.S.-led occupying forces from Iraq on the first anniversary of  the start of the war.
<p> 
			
			Journalists estimated at least a million people streamed  through Rome in probably the biggest single protest, and in  London two anti-war protesters evaded tight security around  parliament to climb the landmark Big Ben clock tower.<p> 
			
			From Tokyo to San Francisco, demonstrators accused  President Bush of having made the world an unsafer place by  going to war in Iraq and triggering a violent backlash from al  Qaeda and other Muslim militant groups.<p> 
			
			But there were fewer demonstrators than in the mass marches  staged around the world in the run-up to the war.<p> 
			
			In Iraq itself, many people said their lives had improved  since Saddam Hussein was toppled, but others said a year of  guerrilla attacks and widespread lawlessness had left them  fearful. No major attacks or protests were reported.<p> 
			
			"Your war, our dead" said one Rome protest banner directed  at Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, President Bush and  British Prime Minister Tony Blair.<p> 
			
			SEA OF PROTEST FLAGS<p> 
			
			"This is a gigantic demonstration," Nobel prize-winning  playwright Dario Fo said as a sea of rainbow-colored peace  flags bobbed above protesters marching to a rally at the Circus  Maximus, site of an ancient Roman stadium.<p> 
			
			Supporters of Berlusconi, a staunch backer of the U.S.-led  invasion who has also sent troops to Iraq, issued a statement  criticizing the protesters and accusing them of having  "paralyzed" the capital.<p>

"These aren't pacifist demonstrations. They are  demonstrations against the United States, against the Italian  government and, in many ways, against the West," Deputy Prime  Minister Gianfranco Fini told the AGI news agency.<p> 
			
			The protests began in Asia where rallies took place in  Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, Bangladesh and Thailand.  They then moved to Europe through the day and more were  expected in the Americas later.<p> 
			
			In Spain, many protesters blamed the previous conservative  government's decision to go to war in Iraq for the March 11  Madrid train bombings that killed more than 200 people.<p> 
			
			"The government took the country to war, but it was  ordinary people who got hurt and killed by the terrorists,"  film producer Lila Pla Alemany said on her way to a protest in  Barcelona.<p> 
			
			Incoming Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez  Zapatero, elected last weekend, has pledged to pull Spanish  troops out of Iraq, calling the war a disaster and fiasco.<p> 
			
			"WANTED" POSTERS<p> 
			
			In London, thousands streamed through central London  carrying "Wanted" posters bearing the faces of Bush and Prime  Minister Tony Blair, Washington's main ally on Iraq.<p> 
			
			"We want to send a clear message to...Blair that we and the  British people are fed up with the half-truths and evasions on  Iraq," said a protest organizer, Stephen Tindale.<p> 
			
			He and many other protesters accuse Bush, Blair and other  leaders who backed the war of lying when they said it was  necessary because Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction.  No such arms have been found.<p>

In Greece, around 10,000 protesters marched toward the U.S.  embassy in Athens which was protected by hundreds of riot  police. But the numbers were well down on the some 100,000 who  marched against the war last year.<p> 
			
			In Germany, several thousand people took part in  demonstrations in about 70 cities and towns across the country.  About 1,000 protested outside a U.S. air base at Ramstein.  "Happy Birthday Mass Murder," said one banner.<p> 
			
			Some 3,000 people turned out in Sydney, chanting "End the  occupation, troops out" and carrying an effigy of Prime  Minister John Howard, a firm supporter of the war. Last year  some 200,000 protested against the war.<p> 
			
			An estimated 120,000 protested across Japan, including two  rallies in Tokyo that each drew about 30,000 people, the Kyodo  news agency said.<p> 
			
			Yasuko Nagasawa, 41, said she feared the presence of  Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in Iraq could make her  country a target.<p> 
			
			"If the SDF stays in Iraq, something like 9/11 will happen  in Japan. The troops must come home," she said.<p>
