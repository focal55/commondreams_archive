<p>NEW PALTZ &#151; Village Mayor <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0519-04.htm">Jason West</a> was charged yesterday with 19 criminal counts after performing 25 gay weddings last week, an act of defiance that is stoking the already intense debate over what constitutes marriage in New York.
<P>
West, 26, was charged with solemnizing marriages for couples who had no licenses, a misdemeanor under the domestic relations law, Ulster County District Attorney Donald Williams said. Although West could face a maximum penalty of a year in jail, Williams said a jail term wasn't being contemplated.
<P>
The mayor said he would plead not guilty at his court hearing today and that he would still go through with his plans to marry as many as two dozen gay couples on Saturday. He performed the ceremonies last week despite the town clerk's refusal to issue marriage licenses to the couples.
<P>
"I'm incredibly disappointed," West said yesterday. "Apparently, it's a crime to uphold the constitution of New York state."
<P>

Absent jail, punishment could run from a $25 to $500 fine. 
<P>
By focusing his prosecution narrowly on the provisions of the state's domestic relations law that make it a misdemeanor to marry a couple without a license, Williams is skirting the much more volatile issue of whether the law also prohibits same-sex couples from marrying.
<P>
"I am not so arrogant to believe that the far-reaching issue of whether this state should recognize same-sex marriage should be decided by a part-time mayor or by the district attorney of Ulster County," Williams said. "That issue should be resolved at a state level, preferably by the Legislature, or at a federal level, or by some other body that has the power and issue before them."
<P>
That debate is expected to take another turn in the next day or so, when state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said he would issue an opinion about whether the domestic relations law permits same-sex marriages, an opinion that will turn on whether the law is gender-neutral.
<P>
An opinion from Spitzer that the marriages are legal almost certainly would provoke a stampede of gay men and women to town and city halls in New York, where several other mayors &#151; including Nyack Mayor John Shields &#151;  have said they will perform the ceremonies.
<P>
An opinion that the marriages are allowed also could breathe new life into an effort by the Republican majority in the state Senate to enact a law prohibiting same-sex marriages in New York, an effort that has gone nowhere in five years even as 38 other states enacted similar laws. 
<P>
"It's moved to the front burner," said Sen. Serphin Maltese, R-Queens, the bill's main sponsor. "Given what the irresponsible mayor of New Paltz has done, it's roused a great deal of opposition."
<P>
Another effort to pass legislation allowing gay marriages also has gone nowhere in the Senate or the Assembly. The bill's sponsor in the Senate, Manhattan Democrat Tom Duane, will hold a forum on the bill in Albany today.
<P>
In New Paltz, Williams said he would not prosecute any of the individuals whom West married and would not speculate on whether the marriages were legal.
<P>
Late in the day, West's voicemail still was inviting gay couples interested in marrying to fill out a form on the village's Web site (<a href="http://www.villageofnewpaltz.org" target="_new">www.villageofnewpaltz.org</a>). His lawyer, Joshua Rosenkranz, acknowledged that West performed the ceremonies without marriage licenses, but said no one "would consider prosecuting a mayor for performing a marriage if a city clerk refused to marry a biracial couple or a Catholic to a Protestant."

<P>
"If the Department of Health will not abide by the law, then they're the ones violating the law," Rosenkranz said. "He's fulfilling his duty."
<P>
Municipal clerks issue marriage licenses &#151; or deny them &#151; on behalf of the state Health Department. The department has said the domestic relations law prohibits same-sex marriages and last week asked Spitzer to seek a court injunction blocking West from performing additional marriages, which Spitzer declined to do. 
<P>
The domestic relations law is a wide-reaching statute defining every aspect of marriage. The law does not expressly prohibit same-sex marriage, but refers several times to husbands and wives and even to grooms and brides. Advocates for gay marriage are basing their argument on the fact gender references appear only in technical sections of the law, while the sections that set the qualifications for marriage refer only to "parties" and "persons."

<P>
"There is nothing in there that says anything about the gender of the parties," said Alan Scheinkman, a White Plains lawyer who has taught family law at several universities and wrote "New York Law of Domestic Relations" in 1996. "Marriage is a civil contract. Obviously, men can make contracts with other men, women can make contracts with women, women can make contracts with men." 

<P>
Gov. George Pataki reiterated yesterday that he reads the law differently.

<P>
"In my view, the law of New York currently is very clear," Pataki said. "Marriage in New York is between a man and a woman, and as public officials we should enforce that law."
