<p>President Fidel Castro accused US President George W. Bush of planning to have him assassinated to overthrow Cuba's communist government.

<p>Castro also warned Friday that he was ready to "go down fighting" if the United States should try to invade Cuba at any time.

<p>Speaking at the end of a regional meeting against the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) here, Castro said Bush had conspired to assassinate him.

<p>"We knew that Mr. Bush had made a commitment with the mafia of the Cuban-American Foundation to kill me. I accuse him of this," Castro told some 1,000 representatives from 32 nations.

<p>During his lengthy, improvised address at the 3rd Hemispheric Meeting for the Fight Against the FTAA, Castro, 77, went over the history of North and South America and the world, criticizing "neo-liberal capitalism" and globalization.

<p>Most of the five-hour speech, however, was targeted at the "belligerent behavior" of the United States.

<p>After accusing Bush of conspiring with the virulent anti-Castro Cuban-American community of Miami to make him a dead man, Castro said, referring to himself: "The deceased can still talk. The deceased can make plans. He's not dead yet."

<p>"And those idiots better not believe we're wasting our time, because we really work at our job. This country will never give up. It will never lay down its weapons," Castro stressed.

<p>He said Cuba does not want "in any way to assume the cost of a war (against) Yankee imperialism," but he warned that despite the tremendous pressure from Washington, "we won't budge at all from our principles."

<p>"I'm telling you, I don't want to survive a war. I've already done my part and I still have to do what I have to do. Weapons in hand, I don't care how I die, but I'm confident that if they invade us, I will go down fighting," Castro said to thunderous applause.
