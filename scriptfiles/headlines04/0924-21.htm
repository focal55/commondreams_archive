<p>BUFFALO, N.Y. - Buoyed by a worldwide outpouring of support, an artist targeted by a terrorism investigation for allegedly using biological materials as a medium says he is ready to get back to work.
<p>Steven Kurtz, also a professor at the University of Buffalo, is set to take part in the Cinematexas festival in Austin this weekend and has plans for presentations in Montreal and New York City over the next few months.
<p>Kurtz became the target of a federal terrorism investigation in May after firefighters found the materials during an 911 call at his home. Kurtz had called to report that his wife had died from an apparent heart attack.
<p>He was indicted a month later for plotting with Robert Ferrell, the former chairman of the University of Pittsburgh's human genetics department, to improperly obtain potentially harmful organisms. Ferrell allegedly used his school account with a biological supply company to order serratia marcescens and bacillus atrophaeus for art projects.
<p>Kurtz and Ferrell have both pleaded innocent to mail fraud and wire fraud charges contained in a June indictment which accused him of improperly obtaining bacterial agents. If convicted, they face a maximum of 20 years in prison.
<p>The Critical Art Ensemble, which Kurtz helped found, has used human DNA and other bio-materials in works meant to draw attention to political and social issues, such as genetically altered foods.
<p>In an e-mail received Thursday, Kurtz outlined his upcoming appearances. A discussion of past projects of the Critical Art Ensemble will be the focus of the Texas appearance, he wrote. A paper being presented in Montreal in two weeks would address germ warfare and the negative effect on public health policy, while a version of CAE's Molecular Invasion project would be presented in New York City sometime next month, he said.
<p>Kurtz also acknowledged his backers around the globe. They have used Kurtz's case to highlight their concerns over the rights of privacy and artistic and academic freedom since terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
<p>The University of Buffalo held a forum just this month exploring the relationship between art and government. An exhibit discussed at the session is titled "Shutters," which explores issues of privacy and surveillance through the work of nine artists, including Niels Bonde of Denmark, who equips stuffed animals and other inanimate objects with paranoia-inducing cameras.
<p>"I thought it was appalling," Bonde said of the Kurtz indictment. "Have they no sensitivity toward that man's tragedy and also, don't they understand art? ... That was my initial reaction."</p>
