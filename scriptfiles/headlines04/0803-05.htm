<p>Employment practices at Wal-Mart, the nation's largest employer with 
relatively lower labor costs in the retail sector, cost California taxpayers 
about $86 million annually in public assistance to company workers, according 
to a study released Monday by a UC Berkeley research institute.
<P>The study estimates that low wages force employees to accept $32 million 
annually in health-related services and $54 million per year in other 
assistance, such as subsidized school lunches, food stamps and subsidized 
housing.
<P>Wal-Mart questioned the validity of the report, saying the authors 
undervalued the wages and benefits the chain's employees receive.
<P>The UC report comes from the <a href="http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/" target="_new">Berkeley Labor Center</a>, an institute that is 
openly supportive of union causes. Although its researchers have in the past 
accepted funding from the grocery workers' union to conduct studies, this 
report was not funded by labor, its authors said.
<P>Wal-Mart, and its possible expansion in California, is a major topic in 
labor circles as negotiators for 45,000 union grocery clerks in the Bay Area 
begin contract talks with Safeway, Albertson's and other major employers. The 
current contract expires Sept. 11. The union, the United Food and Commercial 
Workers, and management are also working on a separate pact covering 15,000 
Sacramento Valley union workers.
<P>These negotiations follow the disruptive 139-day strike and lockout of 
nearly 70,000 union grocery clerks in Southern California that ended Feb. 29. 
<P>In all these talks, management is using Wal-Mart's presence and proposed 
California expansion as a negotiating tactic, arguing they must lower labor 
costs to be competitive with the company and other low-cost grocers. Union 
leadership is backing political efforts to limit Wal-Mart's growth. Authors 
Arindrajit Dube of the UC Berkeley Institute of Industrial Relations and Ken 
Jacobs of the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education make a 
number of assumptions in their study, beginning with a workforce estimate of 
44,000 Wal-Mart employees at 143 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in California 
who earn an estimated 31 percent less than workers in the large retail sector 
as a whole.
<P>The wage difference is even greater when comparing Bay Area Wal-Mart 
workers with other union retail workers: The estimate is that Wal-Mart workers 
earn on average $9.40 an hour compared with $15.31 for union grocery workers, 
39 percent less, and the study estimates that they are half as likely to have 
health benefits.
<P>A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, Cynthia Lin, said, "It's disappointing that 
UC researchers would release a study which has such questionable findings, but 
then again, they are going to arrive at faulty conclusions when they work off 
faulty assumptions.''
<P>She said the study reports wages incorrectly. Bay Area workers earn an 
average of $11.08 an hour while statewide it is $10.37. 
<P>Also, 90 percent of Wal-Mart's workers have health insurance, Lin said.
<P>Of them, 50 percent have coverage through Wal-Mart and 40 percent through 
other sources. She added that two-thirds of workers are senior citizens, 
college students or second-income providers.
<P>The UC authors do not have data on actual public assistance for Wal-Mart 
workers. They take information from several sources, including testimony about 
company wages in a sex-discrimination lawsuit brought against Wal-Mart. They 
say that, at such low wages, many Wal-Mart workers rely on a public safety net.
<P>The authors extrapolate that if other large California retailers apply 
the Wal-Mart model of wages and benefits to their 750,000 employees, it would 
cost taxpayers an additional $410 million a year in public assistance to 
employees.
<P>David Theroux, founder and president of the libertarian Independent 
Institute in Oakland, said it is important to consider who the Wal-Mart 
employees are: They may be former unemployed workers, they may be retirees or 
have taken a second job out of necessity, or they may be developmentally 
disabled or have any number of disadvantages. "If we eliminate Wal-Mart ... it 
means those people are unemployed. Is it better for them to be employed or 
unemployed?'' Theroux asked.
<P>Theroux also faulted the study for what he said is a presumption that Wal-
Mart employees are more prone to go on welfare rolls. "How do they know that? 
They need to show that,'' he said.
<P>He added that, historically, competition drives up wages. It sharpens 
workers' skills and boosts productivity so workers can command higher wages. 
"It works in high tech. Why would retail be any different?'' Theroux said.
<P>The study authors say in their conclusion, "In effect, Wal-Mart is 
shifting part of its labor costs onto the public.'' Co-author Jacobs, in an 
interview, said he hopes that policy-makers keep that argument in mind when 
Wal-Mart seeks to expand.
<P>Indeed, the Los Angeles City Council will hold a hearing Wednesday on 
legislation that would make approval of a big-box store depend on the city 
government's evaluation of its economic impact.
