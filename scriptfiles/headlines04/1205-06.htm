<p>Kofi Annan  made headlines last week - but for all the wrong reasons. The highly respected UN secretary-general saw his authority questioned because his son received payments from an oil-for-food program and even President Bush added his cent's worth by demanding a "full and fair" inquiry.
<p>Add the claims of sexism and favoritism made by employees and the UN-baiters had a field day. The organization that US Republicans love to hate was revealed as a corrupt, self-serving oligarchy with bottomless pockets and dubious morals .
<p>Except that it is nothing of the sort. The charges are not new, just different in character and scale. From its inception the UN has faced criticism: it is too big, too unwieldy, too expensive and too bureaucratic, with the result that its achievements are modest and when it does act it is usually too little, too late. 
<p>Last week's real news was the publication of <a href="http://www.un.org/secureworld/" target="_new"><i>A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility</i></a>, a 95-page document with 101 recommendations for the UN . It was presented to the organization by Anand Panyarachun, formerly Thailand's prime minister and now the UN's security guru, but it was Annan who had commissioned the inquiry last November.
<p> The document examines the main threats to global security - poverty, environmental degradation, terrorism, civil conflict, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and organized crime - and puts forward ways to counter them. Some are a mix of optimism and wishful thinking, including the suggestion that every country should sign up to the Commission on Human Rights. Others are just good housekeeping. Nobody would cavil at a review of UN staffing procedures to ensure it has the right people in the right place at the right time. 
<p>The most controversial is the proposal that the Security Council should be enlarged and given clearer guidelines for authorizing military action. Again, few would disagree that the UN's executive should be strengthened. In past months it has shown itself to be toothless in the face of the humanitarian tragedy in Darfur and it allowed itself to be emasculated over Iraq.
<p>One of the report's authors, Professor Stephen Stedman of Stanford University, pointed out: "There is no consensus whatsoever in the member states regarding what is the proper role of the UN in terms of security." He did not mince his words: genocide was an everyday fact and just over a year ago two permanent members of the Security Council went to war against Iraq "with other members saying no".
<p>In that sense the report confronts the problem that threatened to tear apart the UN - the US policy of unilateral action against a perceived threat. To meet future threats Annan insists the UN must return to the policy of collective responsibility and embrace the idea that no one member is more powerful than the others combined. This is a clear dig at Washington's obsession with getting in its retaliation first, and the report advocates being more proactive in dealing with threats before they get out of hand.
<p>The proposals have been broadly welcomed but implementation depends on a strong secretary-general, respected by the world community. Annan is just that but at the very moment when he should be showing his authority his position is being undermined by those with an interest in devaluing the creation of a consensus to combat terrorism.
<p>When the report was commissioned Annan told the UN it had come to "a fork in the road" and must change direction to meet the needs of a new security situation. Now that we know the way ahead, good sense suggests it is up to the Security Council to take it.
