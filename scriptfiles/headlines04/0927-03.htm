<p>Voting arrangements in Florida do not meet "basic international requirements" and could undermine the US election, former US President Jimmy Carter says.
<p>He said a repeat of the irregularities of the much-disputed 2000 election - which gave President George W Bush the narrowest of wins - "seems likely".
<p>Mr Carter, a veteran observer of polls worldwide, also accused Florida's top election official of "bias".
<p>His remarks come ahead of the first TV debate between Mr Bush and John Kerry. 
<p>They are expected to discuss the war on Iraq and homeland security during the programme on Thursday.
<p>Recent opinion polls give Mr Bush a lead over Mr Kerry of between 3% and 9%.
<p><b>Reforms unlikely</b>
<p>In an article in the Washington Post newspaper, Mr Carter, a Democrat, wrote that reforms - agreed after the last vote in Florida had been marred by counting problems - had not yet been implemented.
<p>He accused Florida Secretary of State Glenda Hood, a Republican, of trying to get the name of independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader included on the state ballot, knowing he might divert Democrat votes.
<p>"A fumbling attempt has been made recently to disqualify 22,000 African Americans (likely Democrats), but only 61 Hispanics (likely 
Republicans), as alleged felons."
<p>Mr Carter said Florida Governor Jeb Bush - brother of the president - had "taken no steps to correct these departures from principles of fair and equal treatment or to prevent them in the future".
<p>"It is unconscionable to perpetuate fraudulent or biased electoral practices in any nation," he added.
<p>"With reforms unlikely at this late stage of the election, perhaps the only recourse will be to focus maximum public scrutiny 
on the suspicious process in Florida."</p>
