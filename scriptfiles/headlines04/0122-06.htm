<p>In violence in the Gaza Strip, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was shot dead Thursday by Israeli troops.</p>

<!--/endimage/-->"I will continue to be prime minister next year. All the rumors about my eventual resignation or about a voluntary suspension of my functions are just foolishness," Sharon was quoted as saying after Wednesday's indictment of property developer David Appel.</p>
<p>Appel was charged with trying to bribe then foreign minister Sharon through his son Gilad, along with deputy prime minister Ehud Olmert, then mayor of Jerusalem, in exchange for their help in securing a major Greek property deal.</p>
<p>The radio said judicial officials could decide in the coming weeks whether there are grounds to indict Sharon himself, after additional material is examined and the premier interrogated again.</p>
<p>And the daily Haaretz revealed that acting attorney general Edna Arbel believed there was enough evidence to indict Sharon for having received bribes from Appel, although the final decision is up to the next attorney general.</p>
<p>If indicted, Sharon could be forced to step down before his mandate ends in 2007.</p>
<p>Opinion polls Thursday revealed that most Israelis believe their premier is guilty of involvement in corruption.</p>
<p>A survey published in the Israeli daily Maariv showed that 53 percent of the respondents thought he was guilty and 63 percent said he should resign if proven so.</p>
<p>Haaretz ran similar results, with a towering 64 percent of those polled saying Sharon should quit if his involvement in the scandal is proved, and 68 percent saying the premier was not innocent.</p>
<p>A survey in the mass circulation Yediot Aharonot showed even harsher results, with 49 percent saying Sharon needs to step down regardless of the inquiry's findings.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight percent said they believe Sharon should remain in office and 13 percent had no opinion.</p>
<p>The Palestinian leadership, meanwhile, said it feared Sharon could use the looming bribery scandal against them, "to divert attention and avoid facing the truth."</p>
<p>"We are warning against the possibility that Ariel Sharon take advantage of this corruption scandal to embark on a military adventure in the Palestinian territories or somewhere else in the region," Yasser Arafat's top aide Nabil Abu Rudeina also said.</p>
<p>Israeli left-wing MP Yossi Sarid voiced concern that Sharon, "under pressure," could be tempted by rash actions on the Israeli-Arab front to distract public opinion.</p>
<p>It has so far only been alleged that Appel tried to secure the help of Sharon and Olmert to obtain an authorization from the Greek authorities to build a huge tourism resort on a Greek island.</p>
<p>Appel, a behind-the-scenes wheeler dealer in Sharon's right-wing Likud party, offered to finance both men's respective leadership election campaign in exchange, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>He also allegedly offered three million dollars to Gilad for consultancy services on the project despite the premier's son lack of expertise in the area.</p>
<p>The three million was never paid, but Gilad instead received a 100,000-dollar "salary", then a second payment of 2.6 million shekels (590,000 dollars), according to the charges.</p>
<p>Appel also allegedly gave 50,000 shekels (11,300 dollars) to Olmert, having convinced him to organize a dinner with the mayor of Athens to promote the island venture, which was later abandoned.</p>
<p>On the ground in the central Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot dead Mohsen ad-Daur on Thursday, Palestinian medics said.</p>
<p>Palestinian security sources said the boy was part of a group of teenagers hunting birds near the border fence with Israel.</p>
<p>An army spokesman said two teenagers had been wounded and were being treated in Israel after they tried to cross into Israel with a ladder propped up against the fence.</p>
<p>Farther south, the Israeli army withdrew from the Rafah refugee camp after a 48-hour operation during which several dozen Palestinian houses were destroyed, security sources on both sides said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a Palestinian woman was killed and at least three people wounded by Israeli fire, according to witnesses and medical sources.</p>
<p>Although the operation was aimed at uncovering tunnels on the Gaza-Egypt border used by Palestinian militants to smuggle weapons, military sources said no such tunnel was discovered this time.</p>
