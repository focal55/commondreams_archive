<p>NEW YORK  - The United States film ratings board ruled that Michael Moore's controversial "<a href="http://www.fahrenheit911.com/" target="_new">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>" film cannot be viewed by people under 17 unless they are accompanied by an adult, sparking an immediate appeal from the distributors.

<!--/endimage/-->The explosive documentary, set to open in US cinemas on June 25, won the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival, denounces the White House's handling of its "war on terror" and the war on Iraq.
<p>The Motion Picture Association of America said it had given the movie an "R" adult rating because it contained "violent and disturbing images" and strong language.
<p>The film's distributor, Lions Gate Films, responded late Sunday by filing an emergency appeal to have the rating reviewed.
<p>Lions Gate chairman Tom Ortenberg said in a statement the ratings board's decision was "completely unjustified".
<p>"We are adamant about overturning this decision in an expeditious manner to ensure that as many people as possible ... are able to see one of the most important and thought-provoking films of our time," he said.
<p>Moore, the director, noted in the statement that it was "very possible" that many teenagers who were now 15 and 16 would be "recruited to serve in Iraq in the next couple of years".
<p>"If they are old enough to be recruited and capable of being in combat and risking their lives, they certainly deserve the right to see what is going on in Iraq," he said in the statement.
<p>"Fahrenheit 9/11" alleges financial connections between the family of President George W. Bush, its associates and prominent Saudi families, including that of Osama bin Laden, who is blamed for the September 11 attacks.
<p>It also explores the Bush administration's role in evacuating bin Laden relatives from the US after the September 11 attacks.
<p>In May Walt Disney Co., which had held the rights to "Fahrenheit 9/11", created a furore by banning its Miramax Films subsidiary from distributing the movie before the November 2 US presidential elections. Disney justified its decision by saying it was "a nonpartisan company".
<p>Disney then ceded the rights to two of its studio executives, Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who have associated with Lions Gate Films and IFC Entertainment to distribute the film.
