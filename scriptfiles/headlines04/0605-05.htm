<p> WASHINGTON - International environmental and development groups have denounced as completely inadequate a new World Bank commitment to increase its lending to renewable energy projects in developing countries by 20 percent annually over the next five years.
<p>
 A statement signed by nine global green groups and released Thursday said the proposed increase was "marginal at best" and ignored the recommendations of its own studies for much greater investment in renewables, such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency.
 <p>
 "Marginally increasing the funding for renewables is not enough because the World Bank's own numbers show that lending for polluting fuels is growing even faster," said Stephan Singer of World Wildlife Fund International (WWF). 
 <p>
 "The US&#36;200 million that the Bank is pledging for renewables is roughly the cost of their contribution to just one of the many fossil fuel projects they support annually," said Petr Hlobil of CEE Bankwatch, which is based in Prague.
 
<p>
 The Bank made its announcement Tuesday in advance of the <a href="http://www.renewables2004.de/" target="_new">International Conference on Renewable Energies</a> which is taking place this week in Bonn, Germany.
 <p>
 Peter Woicke, the Bank's managing director and the head of its private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), said that the increased lending would effectively double the Bank Group's current pace of lending for renewable projects of roughly &#36;200 million a year by 2010.
 <p>
 "Our strategy -- through programs and policies -- will aim to ensure that renewable energy and energy efficiency are seen as economically viable and essential ingredients in the energy choices of our member nations, not marginal considerations," he said.
 <p>
 Since 1990, the Bank Group, which also includes the Bank's soft-loan facility, the International Development Association (IDA), has been the largest lender for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in poor countries, investing more than &#36;6 billion in its own resources and mobilizing another &#36;10 billion from other public agencies and private sources.
 <p>
 That figure, however, includes lending for hydroelectric dams which most green groups oppose as environmentally destructive. As a result of a number of high-profile campaigns, the Bank has steadily diminished its lending for hydroelectric projects.
 <p>
 The targets announced by Woicke marked the first public Bank response to its Extractive Industries Review (EIR), which was created three years ago to evaluate whether or not the Bank, in light of its mandate to reduce poverty, should continue lending for fossil-fuel projects, particularly coal production.
 <p>
 Headed by a former Indonesian environment minister, Emil Salim, the EIR commission concluded that the Bank should immediately halt its support for coal projects and phase out lending oil projects by 2008. It also called for the Bank Group to increase overall lending for renewable projects by 20 percent of its total energy portfolio each year.
 <p>
 While its renewable portfolio is currently running about &#36;200 million a year, the Bank Group provides about &#36;2.5 billion a year in support of other energy-related projects, the vast majority of them based on fossil fuels.
 <p>
 Thus, under Woicke's plan, which must still be approved by the Bank's board of directors, lending for renewables would increase by only about &#36;40 million next year instead of the roughly &#36;500 million recommended by the EIR.
 <p>
 "They're not even close to the EIR recommendation," said Steve Kretzmann of the Institute for Policy Studies here. "They're pledging 20 percent of a cent when they were asked to give 20 percent of a dollar," he said, adding that the Bank Group has preferred fossil-fuel-related lending over renewables by a 23:1 ration since 1994.
 
<p>
 "At this rate, it will take the Bank Group nearly 20 years before their renewables portfolio reaches current levels of funding for fossil fuels," said Janneke Bruil of Friends of the Earth  International (FoEI) in Amsterdam. "It's absurd."
 <p>
 But Woicke stressed in his announcement that the EIR recommendations were too ambitious, particularly for poor countries, and suggested that the green and development groups who supported them were being unrealistic, if not hypocritical.
 <p>
 "Rich nations -- however well-intentioned -- cannot prescribe difficult, sweeping changes in technology for poor nations while remaining idle, silent or reluctant on the issue of their own energy efficiency," he said.
<p>
 ''Environmental advocates who favor new, expensive technology cannot ignore the millions of people who are consigned to clear-cutting forests for lack of low-cost energy options," he added.
<p>
But the group insisted that the Bank is not being nearly ambitious enough, particularly given rising concern over the hidden costs of encouraging the use of fossil fuels, particularly with respect to global warming, not to mention the environmental and social impact of such projects on local communities.
<p>
"While we welcome the Bank at least setting a target, the money is not enough to be credible," said Daniel Mittler of Greenpeace International. "The Bank must phase out support for fossil fuels by 2008."
<p>
While embraced by the environmental community, the EIR's recommendations have come under strong attack by big oil and gas companies and by private banks that underwrite their projects. The representatives of some energy-producing governments have also assailed the recommendations, noting that for all the destruction associated with big mining and energy projects, their economies depend on exports of those resources.
<p>
This week's conference in Bonn is designed to promote the use of renewables which a growing number of experts say have become commercially viable in ways that were not foreseen even a decade ago.
<p>
In a report released last month by WorldWatch Institute, researchers noted that wind and solar power have become the fastest growing energy sources over the past ten years, and their attractiveness has only increased as a result of soaring oil and gas prices and growing instability in the Middle East.
<p>
Altogether, renewables -- including wind, solar, geothermal, and modern bio-energy -- supply enough electricity for more than 300 million homes worldwide, and last year, an estimated &#36;20.3 billion -- or about one-sixth of total global investment in power generation equipment -- was invested in such sources.
<p>
While their greatest advances have been in Japan and Europe, developing country giants Brazil, China and India are also making significant investments and are considered major markets for renewables in the coming decade, according to the report's author, Janet Swain.
