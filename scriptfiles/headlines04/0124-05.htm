<p> The latest animal health crisis to arise after avian flu claimed its first human life in Thailand forms part of a pattern that has gone along with industrialization and mass transportation of livestock. Animal disease now travels far and fast in types of farming and food distribution that make it very hard to control. 
<p>Thailand exports large quantities of chicken to the UK and other countries in Europe. According to figures from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the UK imported 36,649 tons of poultry meat from Thailand in the first 10 months of last year, a 50% increase on the previous year.  
<p>The outbreak has raised two separate concerns: that the flu might spread to flocks in other countries, resulting in large-scale losses; and that it might have implications for human health. If the virus mutates it might be possible for humans catching it to pass it on to other humans, threatening a flu pandemic.  
<p>In the age of global trade, retailers and manufacturers source their raw materials where they are cheapest. The British poultry industry has struggled to compete with prices from south-east Asia and Brazil where labor costs are much lower.  
<p>Thailand and Brazil have seen the rapid industrialization of livestock in the last few years as they have pushed for export-led growth. Many UK producers meanwhile are barely able to cover the cost of production, as prices have fallen in supermarkets.  
<p>The distances involved mean that little fresh meat on sale in the UK is sourced from Thailand, but poultry for ready meals and other processed foods such as nuggets is increasingly being bought frozen on the global market. Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer do not buy any chicken from outside the EU for their processed foods, but the decision not to use cheap Thai or Brazilian meat is believed to have added &#163;10m a year to M&amp;S's costs. Most other retailers have sourced the cheaper products.  
<p>Modern food systems mean that animal diseases travel far and fast. Poultry is raised in intensive factory farms with units of 30,000 to 50,000 birds being common. Once a virus gets into a flock it is virtually impossible to control except by mass culling. That means that economic losses are large, and it appears that the Thai government has been hiding its outbreak of avian flu for months to protect its export trade.  
<p>The epidemic of avian flu that struck Holland last year showed how hard the disease can be to contain. Despite bans on movement of animals, which the Dutch army was called on to enforce, the disease spread like wildfire through the country's intensive poultry industry, and more than 30m chickens had to be killed. It spread from the Netherlands to Belgium and Germany before being contained.  
<p>The proximity of the UK to Holland, and the regular movement of lorries between Dutch poultry processors and UK sites made that outbreak a much more serious risk to the British industry. The risk of avian flu being transmitted to British flocks from Thai poultry is very small, according to experts, since we do not import live birds.  
<p>The main route of transmission is from live chicken to live chicken or from people carrying the virus on their clothes or vehicles as they move between farms, much in the way that foot and mouth was spread. The virus is carried in feces and mucus. Many chicken farms here took hygiene precautions during the Dutch crisis last year in case the disease spread. Although factory processing methods in Europe mean that about half of chicken meat is contaminated with campylobacter, which is also carried in feces, the chances of catching the flu from meat are said to be negligible.  
<p>Although there were tight restrictions on the movement of live animals, eggs and chicks during the Dutch crisis, the EU did not ban exports of meat from Holland. The ban on Thai meat appears to be more of a warning to the Thais to get their house in order than a response to risk to consumers. A new case of chicken from Thailand testing positive for nitrofurans, antibiotics banned in the EU because they are thought to be cancer-causing, came to light recently.  
<p>"The real concern is over the behavior of the Thai government," said Peter Bradnock, chairman of the British Poultry Council.  
<p>"This raises questions over the other guarantees the EU accepts when it imports. We are fooling ourselves if we think we can apply the same controls in countries like Brazil and Thailand when only 30% of their market is for export. There are risks there."  
<p>The potential threat to human health comes not from the meat but from the possibility that the virus might mutate or attach itself to a human form of flu so that it could be easily spread from person to person. A Dutch vet died last year, and now deaths are being confirmed around southeast Asia. Humans catch avian flu from close contact with chickens or their feces The fact that the flu has affected people in so many different countries has alarmed health authorities further.  
<p>As well as the foot and mouth epidemic, Europe's farmers have suffered crippling outbreaks of swine fever in the last two years. Although Britain has so far escaped avian flu, groups campaigning against intensive factory farming say there is an inevitability about each new panic.
