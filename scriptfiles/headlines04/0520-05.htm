<p> WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush's Republican party is split over the examination of the US military abuse of Iraqi detainees, with some lawmakers complaining that it is impeding the military effort in Iraq.
 
<p>
 
Conservative lawmakers said a crush of Congress hearings over events at the Abu Ghraib jail had made it difficult for top military and Defense Department officials to focus on the Iraq insurgency and the war on terror.
 
<p>
 "Quite frankly, I'm sorry that you guys are here," Republican senator James Inhofe told General John Abizaid, head of US Central Command, and Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, commander of US forces in Iraq at a hearing Wednesday of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
 
<p>
 "I'd rather be handling this in some way where we can get your statement, get it in the record and have that done with, because you have an awesome responsibility," he added.
 
<p>
 "I know that you're anxious to get back to the battlefield and that's where your mind is today and that's where your heart is," Inhofe said.
 
<p>
 Lawmakers have virtually unanimously expressed disgust over the sexual humiliation and physical abuse of prisoners in Iraq, which have garnered the United States international criticism.
 
<p>
 But some conservative lawmakers feel that too much is being made of the scandal, and said the seemingly endless succession of hearings have become a distraction.
 
<p>
 "We are at this point disserving our military operation in theater," Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday.
 
<p>
 He was particularly critical of John Warner, Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for "jerking out these battlefield commanders" from Iraq.
 
<p>
 
Abizaid and Sanchez, Hunter said, "have problems stacking up on their desks right now and in their commands with respect to force protection, surveillance, deterrence of the enemy in a number of key areas, intelligence operations, and prosecuting this war and protecting our troops."
 
<p>
 
"The inattention and the lack of focus that we're now giving the war ... is detrimental to the 135,000 good people who are fighting right now in theater and who ... need a focused leadership," Hunter said.
 
<p>
 Other lawmakers have worried that the hearings could have a negative impact on criminal prosecutions against those charged in the prison abuse cases.
 
<p>
 But several outspoken Republican senators have insisted that frequent and open hearings are the only way to get to the root of the scandal.
 
<p>
 "The complexity of this issue requires that more hearings be held to establish a body of fact needed for oversight by the Senate," Warner said.
 
<p>
 He added that he offered Abizaid and Sanchez the chance to appear at the hearing via videoconference, but scheduled the hearing in person when he learned they already had travel planned to the United States this week.
 
<p>
 Another supporter of the hearings, Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, pointedly asked Abizaid on Wednesday whether his appearance before the committee posed a "burden."
 
<p>
 "No, sir. We feel it's our responsibility," the general replied.
 
<p>
 Graham noted that the open hearings, in his view, have had a positive public relations value.
<p>
"Is it fair to say that people in the region, the Arab world, are watching these hearings and have been?" the South Carolina senator asked.
<p>
"It's fair to say that, Senator, yes sir," Abizaid replied.
<p>
"It helps our cause," he said, "because they have to know that people will be held accountable that are in positions of responsibility."
