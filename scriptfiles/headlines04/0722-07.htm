<p>WASHINGTON - President Bush is trailing his  Democratic challenger John Kerry by a big margin among  potential Hispanic voters, according to a new survey of Latino  attitudes toward politics released on Thursday.<p> 
			
			Kerry and his vice presidential choice, John Edwards, have  the support of 62 percent of the Hispanics polled, while the  Bush/Dick Cheney ticket has 32 percent support, according to a  joint survey by The Pew Hispanic Center and the Kaiser Family  Foundation.<p> 
			
			Bush, according to exit polls, got about 35 percent of the  Hispanic vote in 2000, a key constituency which could decide  the election in swing states like Florida and Arizona, both of  which went narrowly to Bush.<p> 
			
			The survey polled 788 adults between July 12 and 20, and  had a margin of error 3.5 percent.<p> 
			
			The results were released together with a separate poll of  Latino attitudes toward politics, which showed Hispanics were  generally skeptical on the war in Iraq, divided over the role  of government and concerned with economic issues rather than  immigration.<p> 
			
			Registered Hispanic voters ranked education as their top  priority, with 54 percent saying the issue was extremely  important in deciding their presidential vote, followed by the  economy and jobs.<p> 
			
			Only 27 percent considered immigration -- an issue often  used to court Latino voters -- as a major concern, ranking it  eleventh overall, behind the federal budget deficit.<p> 
			
			President Bush has proposed a temporary work visa for  between 8 and 12 million illegal immigrants, a move backed by  54 percent of the registered Latinos. But 83 percent supported  a more ambitious proposal by Democrats, which would give the  right to permanent residence to illegal immigrants who had  spent a long time in the United States.<p> 
			
			Fully 56 percent of Hispanics disapproved of Bush's  handling of the situation in Iraq, roughly mirroring sentiment  among the overall U.S. population, the survey said.<p> 
			
			About 40 million Hispanics reside in the United States,  with about seven or eight million expected to vote, according  to Hispanic groups.<p> 
			
			Latinos who are registered to vote are better educated and  more likely to use English as their primary language than their  counterparts who are not U.S. citizens, according to the poll.<p> 
			
			The annual Pew Hispanic/Kaiser Family survey polled 2,288  Hispanics between April 21 and June 9, 2004, and had a margin  of error of 2.83 percent.<p> 
			
			The margin of error for the smaller sample that was  eligible to vote -- 1,166 -- was 4.18 percent.<p> 
			
			On Wednesday, another poll released by The Washington Post,  the Univision Spanish language television network and the Tomas  Rivera Policy Institute found that Hispanic voters strongly  favored Kerry.<p> 
			
			Asked who they would vote for if the November presidential  election were held today, 60 percent said they would choose  Kerry and 30 percent said Bush, according to the poll conducted  from July 6 to 16.
