<p>WASHINGTON -- Senator John F. Kerry strikes a decidedly stronger pro-Israel position in a new policy paper than he did a few months ago, as he attempts to enlist the support of Jewish voters who have been gravitating to President Bush and away from their tradition of voting Democratic in presidential elections.</p>
<p>In the policy paper, which has not been released publicly, Kerry outlines clear, strongly worded positions on several issues important to the American Jewish community. He calls for more forceful action to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons, fully backs Israel's construction of a 425-mile-long barrier between Israel and the Palestinian territories that the paper refers to as ''a security fence,&quot;  and pledges to work to push for a new Palestinian political class to replace Yasser Arafat, who is called a ''failed leader.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier in the campaign, Kerry got off to a shaky start with some Jewish groups. Last October he called the barrier -- composed mostly of electronic fencing with razor wire and a ditch along a tracking road, but with some stretches made of concrete -- a ''barrier to peace.&quot; The new paper says building it is ''a legitimate right of self-defense&quot; and ''not a matter&quot; to be taken up by the International Court of Justice, which has criticized the move.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Israel's High Court of Justice, responding to Palestinian complaints, issued a landmark ruling saying a planned 20-mile section of the barrier in the West Bank must be rerouted, because the current path creates hardships for thousands of Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts senator earlier remarked that he might appoint James A. Baker III, secretary of state in the first Bush administration, a special peace negotiator. Jewish groups quickly attacked the proposal and accused Baker of making anti-Israel statements. The paper, drafted by policy and political advisers, does not say who Kerry would pick for that role.</p>
<p>With the paper, titled ''Strengthening Israel's Security and Bolstering the US-Israel Special Relationship,&quot; Kerry is attempting to reintroduce himself to Jewish voters. ''John Kerry has been at the forefront of the fight for Israel's security during his 19 years in the US Senate,&quot; it says. ''His pro-Israel voting record is second to none.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans suggested some political desperation was behind the document.</p>
<p>''There is a key battle for the Jewish vote underway,&quot; said Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, based in Washington. ''Democrats are particularly scared. This underscores the efforts they have to make to hold on to what was a sure part of their base. The reason for their efforts is this president is going to do substantially better than he did in 2000. That has them worried.&quot;</p>
<p>Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of Jewish voters have backed the Democratic nominee for the White House; in 2000, 19 percent went for President Bush. The Bush-Cheney campaign is hoping to capitalize on the president's strong support for the Israeli government, the military removal of Saddam Hussein, and the pursuit of the war on terrorism to increase that support to 30 percent or more in November. In a closely contested election, those voters could prove critical in swing states such as Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.</p>
<p>Some Jewish leaders say that Kerry's record on Israel is not well known outside Washington and Massachusetts.</p>
<p>''They have done a lot of catching up [to Bush] and are more effectively reaching out,&quot; said Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice president of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, based in New York.</p>
<p>Added David Harris, executive director of the nonpartisan American Jewish Committee in New York: ''I think as the campaign has found its footing, there has unquestionably been a significant outreach to the Jewish community,&quot; particularly in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A staunchly pro-Israel stance may have other political repercussions.</p>
<p>James Zogby, president of the Arab-American Institute in Washington, said many Arab-American voters remain undecided about the candidates and could be pushed to support Bush. He estimated as many as 28 percent, or 170,000 voters.</p>
<p>They are also an important voting bloc in swing states such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida, he said. ''American Jews are voting Democratic, and it has nothing to do with Israel,&quot; he said. ''They know Kerry will be good on Israel. My community is not a lock either way. The question [is], is the margin you lose in our community greater than the margin you win in the Jewish communities?&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kerry has redoubled his efforts to reach out to Jewish groups. Senior members of his staff met in Washington with the American Jewish Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The policy paper, used as talking points in some of these meetings, attempts to portray his pro-Israel credentials as being as strong as, if not stronger than, Bush's. The document says, for instance, ''Israel's cause must be America's cause.&quot;</p>
<p>It chides the Bush administration for not taking stronger action to prevent Iran, a primary supporter of anti-Israel terrorist groups, from developing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>''The failure of the Bush administration to thwart Iran's efforts to amass nuclear weapons poses a real threat to the safety and security of Israel, the US, and the rest of the free world,&quot; it says.</p>
<p>It also says that Kerry was a sponsor of the Syria Accountability Act, which banned certain American exports in an effort to punish the Arab nation for supporting anti-Israel terror groups.</p>
<p>Kerry expresses support for Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza, says that after a final settlement Palestinians must settle outside Israel, and backs the Israeli plan to annex some West Bank settlements, as Bush does. The paper also reaffirms Kerry's support for Israel's spring 2002 offensive against Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other terrorists groups in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>The document also pledges that a Kerry administration would work to strengthen Israel's economy, by helping jump-start the high-tech sector, investing further in Israeli-made homeland security technologies, and increasing cooperation between Israeli industries and the US Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>The paper says that ''John Kerry understands that anti-Semitism masked in anti-Israel rhetoric is a dangerous trend threatening both Israel and Jewish communities around the world.&quot; He also pledges to ''take governments around the world to task for failing to address this escalating threat.&quot;</p>
<p>''Most of his ideas are in the mainstream, and they are not that different from President Bush's,&quot; said Edward S. Walker, former assistant secretary of state for Near East Affairs.</p>
<p>Harris, of the American Jewish Committee, stressed that American Jews do not vote purely on a candidate's stance on Mideast issues, but they are extremely important to them. ''American Jews tend to be multi-issue voters but need a certain comfort level on Israel,&quot; he said.</p>
