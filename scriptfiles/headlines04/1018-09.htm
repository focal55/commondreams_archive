      <p>WASHINGTON - President Bush governs from a "love of power" and right-wing 
        ideology rather than religious beliefs, and he has yet to hold anyone 
        in his administration accountable for mistakes, former Vice President 
        Al Gore said on Monday.

As the campaign by Bush and Democrat John Kerry for president headed 
        into the last stretch before the Nov. 2 election, Gore criticized his 
        rival for the White House four years ago on Iraq and other issues. 
      <p>
 "I'm convinced that most of the president's frequent
departures from fact-based analysis have much more to do with
right-wing political and economic ideology than with the
Bible," Gore said in a speech at Georgetown University.
 <p>
 "It is love of power for its own sake that is the original
sin of this presidency," he said.
 <p>
 He painted the Bush administration and its "right-wing"
supporters as pursuing policies for the wealthy and powerful at
the expense of the rest of the country.
 <p>

 "The essential cruelty of Bush's game is that he takes an
astonishingly selfish and greedy collection of economic and
political proposals and then cloaks them with a phony moral
authority, thus misleading many Americans ... who have a deep
and genuine desire to do good in the world," Gore said.
 <p>
 "And in the process, he convinces them to lend
unquestioning support for proposals that actually hurt their
families and their communities," he said.
 <p>
 "Truly, President Bush has stolen the symbolism and body
language of religion and used it to disguise the most radical
effort in American history to take what rightfully belongs to
the American people and give as much of it as possible to the
already wealthy and privileged," he said.
 <p>
 Gore also criticized Bush for not holding anyone in his
administration accountable for problems.
 <p>
 He said Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had not been held
accountable for "the most shameful and humiliating violation of
American principles in recent memory" in the interrogations of
prisoners in Iraq.</p>
