<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->LONDON  - More and more Britons are worried about genetically modified foods, a poll for a consumer rights magazine published suggests. 


<p>
 
   

Sixty-one percent of those polled for Which? magazine said they were concerned about the use of GM material in food production, up for 56 percent two years ago. 


<p>The survey of almost 1,000 people also recorded a rise in the number who said they tried to avoid GM food -- and a fall in the percentage who backed the widespread growth of GM crops.
<p> 


"Consumers clearly don't want GM food and are hardening their stance against it," Which? editor Malcolm Coles said. 


"It's hardly surprising when questions still remain about the risks for health and the environment." 


<p>"The Government has ignored public opinion on this subject for long enough," he added. "It needs to rethink its policy before going ahead with growing GM crops commercially."
<p> 


Earlier this year Prime Minister Tony Blair's government approved the commercial growing of one variety of genetically-modified maize for use as animal feed. 


But it rejected proposals for the commercial cultivation of GM beet and oilseed rape.
<p> 


The Which? survey saw a 13 percentage point rise in the number of people who said they tried to avoid GM food and ingredients, up from 45 percent in 2002 to 58 percent. 


<p>Just over 25 percent backed the growing of GM crops in Britain, down from 32 percent two years ago.
<p> 


However, there was a rise in the number of people satisfied manufacturers are removing GM from their food, up from 28 percent to 33 percent.
<p> 


The findings were welcomed by environmental group Friends of the Earth.
<p> 


"Public opposition to GM food and crops is growing, yet the government is planning to allow widespread GM contamination of non-GM crops," said Clare Oxborrow, the group's GM campaigner. 


<p>"If this happens people will find it increasingly difficult to avoid GM food," she said. "The government must listen to the public and introduce tough new rules to keep our food, farming and environment GM-free."
