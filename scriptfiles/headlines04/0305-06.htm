WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Bush administration today received low marks from U.S. women's organizations for its failure to follow through on promises made to improve women's political and human rights. 
 
<p>
 In an audio press conference the women's groups outlined three key initiatives proclaimed by the President--a "Marshall Plan" to rebuild Afghanistan, an emergency AIDS  relief plan, and involving women in the rebuilding of Iraq -- and graded the administration on its performance. 
 
<p>
 In his January 2004 State of the Union address President Bush said, As of this month, that country [Afghanistan] has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women. 
 
<p>
 To date, however, the administration has not provided its promised Marshall Plan for reconstruction, and security concerns have remained a grave problem for women. More than 30 schools for girls have been burned to the ground, and women's voter registration now stands at only 2% for a proposed June election, mainly because of fear. 
 
<p>
 &quot;In the area of the Marshall Plan we simply have not put our money where our mouth is. We are constantly falling far short,&quot; said Eleanor Smeal, President of the Feminist Majority. Smeal added that thanks to the efforts of U.S. congresswomen, &#36;60 million has been added to the U.S. aid budget to fund Afghan women's programs and &#36;5 million was added for support to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. 
 
<p>
 The President earned an "A" for the proposal, but got a "D" for performance.
 
<p>
 Speaking at World AIDS Day, December 1, 2003 President Bush said: [My] Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief commits&#36;15 billion over the next five years to prevent seven million new HIV  infections and increase support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
 
<p>
 However, the women's groups said, the Bush administration has reneged on its &#36;15 billion pledge over five years (&#36;3 billion per year). For the 2005 fiscal year budget the President requested only &#36;2.8 billion for global funds to fight AIDS, and in FY2004, he asked for only &#36;1.9 billion. 
 
<p>
 Today more than half of all those infected with HIV worldwide, more than half of the 40 million people infected, are women and girls. And in sub-Saharan Africa where the epidemic has taken its greatest toll, over 60 % of those infected are women and girls, said Jodie Jacobson, Executive Director, Center for Health and Gender Equity. 
 
<p>
 She added that HIV infection rates have risen most steeply among married women and adolescent girls. But the Bush administration believes abstinence-only should be the primary focus for prevention efforts and condoms should be provided only to high-risk groups, Jacobsen said.
 
<p>
 The actual funding streams and strategies put forth are not sufficient, nor are they directly affecting those who are most vulnerable in the appropriate ways, said Jacobson. 
 
<p>
 On AIDS, the President scored a "B" for his rhetoric, but another "D for performance.
 
<p>
 On February 16, U.S. Ambassador Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), declared: We in the Coalition are committed to continuing to promote women's rights in Iraq. 
 
<p>
 Currently there are no women governors of Iraq's 18 provinces. Also, women hold only three of 25 seats on the Governing Council, appointed by the U.S.-led CPA. Iraqi women are seeking representation of 40%.
 
<p>
 Under the U.S. occupation, women's participation in the nation-building process has been very limited. We hope women will play a greater role under the new interim Constitution, said June Zeitlin, Executive Director of the Women's Environment and Development Organization.
 
<p>
 Zeitlin explained that without some type of quota system, women will not achieve these goals. Afghanistan's new constitution includes a quota for women, and 15 other countries have attained 30% representation of women in parliament as a result of establishing quotas, she noted.
 
<p>
 Women's participation in the new democracy is not just about numbers or fairness. Its about shaping policies based on women's diverse experiences and responsiveness to their particular needs, Zeitlin said.
 
<p>
The President's promises to support Iraqi women earned him an "A," but his performance was scored as "I" -- for "incomplete."
