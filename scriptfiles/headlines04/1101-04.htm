      <p>MIAMI - Complaint sheets in hand, a voters' bill of rights in their kit, 
        a small army of volunteers has descended on the battleground state of 
        Florida to watch over Tuesday's voting and help avert a repeat of the 
        2000 election debacle. 
      <p>One group, <a href="http://www.electionprotection2004.org/" target="_new">Election 
        Protection</a>, says it is deploying 25,000 volunteers nationwide, thousands 
        of them in Florida, the state that delayed the outcome of the last presidential 
        vote by 36 days before the US Supreme Court halted vote recounts. 
      <p> &quot;The 2000 elections were a wake-up call,&quot; the watchdog group 
        says in its welcoming letter handed out to volunteers streaming in from 
        around the country. 
      <p> &quot;I was unhappy about what happened in Florida in 2000,&quot; said 
        Chris Ott, a 51-year-old house painter who flew thousands of kilometers 
        (miles) from Vashon, Washington to help monitor the voting. 
      <p> &quot;I know they'll try dirty tricks again,&quot; he said, without 
        specifying who &quot;they&quot; are. 
      <p> &quot;We're also here to help people who don't know what their voting 
        rights are,&quot; said Ott, who attended a recent poll monitor training 
        session. 
      <p> Civil rights lawyer Reggie Mitchell explained the oddities of the Florida 
        voting system to the audience, some of whom were wearing the group's distinctive 
        black T-shirts. 
      <p> The volunteers were told that, unlike the poll watchers sent by the 
        parties and the candidates, they must stay at least 15 meters (50 feet) 
        from the polling area, unless a voter asks for their assistance. 
      <p> Several of the watchdog group's member organizations, which include 
        the giant AFL-CIO trade union and black civil rights groups, support Democratic 
        candidate John Kerry, but Mitchell stressed that volunteers must steer 
        well clear of any partisan issues. 
      <p> Ott agreed this was crucial to the volunteers' mission. &quot;We are 
        here to help people vote for Bush, Kerry or whoever they chose and make 
        sure their vote counts,&quot; he said. 
      <p> Mitchell also pointed out that the volunteers were not there to do electoral 
        officials' work. &quot;But it's our job, if they get it wrong, to help 
        them get it right.&quot; 
      <p> Some of the volunteers have already been working for several days during 
        early voting that started on October 18 and has drawn almost 20 percent 
        of Florida's 10-million-strong electorate. 
      <p> Several problems have already cropped up, particularly from voters who 
        said they never received the absentee ballots they requested weeks ago. 
        Thousands of those ballots apparently got lost in the mail. 
      <p> The poll monitors are also on the lookout for &quot;challengers&quot; 
        who approach voters, telling them they are not eligible to cast a ballot. 
        Democrats claim many of those individuals are sent out by the Republicans 
        to intimidate voters. 
      <p> Mitchell claimed a sheriff's deputy in West Palm Beach, &quot;at the 
        instigation of a certain party,&quot; challenged voters waiting in line. 
        The group was considering filing a lawsuit because police officials are 
        not allowed in the immediate vicinity of polling stations unless there 
        is a disturbance. 
      <p> In another incident, a deputy tackled, punched, handcuffed and arrested 
        a journalist who took photos of the line of voters outside a West Palm 
        Beach polling office on Sunday, local media reported. 
      <p> Police claim Palm Beach County electoral authorities have banned journalists 
        from talking to or photographing voters, though this had not been previously 
        announced.
