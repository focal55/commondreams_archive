<p>BAGHDAD  - U.S. troops massed outside the holy  Shi'ite city of Najaf Tuesday, ready for a possible move  against rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and his militia despite  the risk enraged Iraqis would see this as defiling their  shrines.
<p> 
			
Armed groups opposed to the occupation freed some foreign  hostages -- five Ukrainians and three Russians -- but made new  demands for others. Gunmen paraded four Italians and demanded  Rome pull its troops out of Iraq. A French journalist joined  the list of those held captive.<p>

U.S. officials in Washington said that four bodies had been  found in Iraq and the State Department had contacted the  families of seven missing Americans.<p> 
			
			The identities of the dead have not been confirmed, it  said. Two U.S. soldiers are missing in Iraq as well as the  seven U.S. civilians.<p> 
			
			Such is the danger on Iraq's roads that the U.S. Army said  it was suspending some supply convoys until safety improved.<p> 
			
			The Pentagon toll of U.S. soldiers killed in action since  the start of the war rose to 484 Tuesday -- seven higher than  the previous day. In the last eight days at least 65 soldiers  have died in the bloodiest fighting since Saddam Hussein's  fall.<p> 
			
			Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, deputy director of  operations for the U.S. military in Iraq, said a powerful U.S.  force was building up outside Najaf, south of Baghdad, where  Sadr is believed to have taken refuge close to the main shrine.<p> 
			
			A revolt by Sadr's militiamen this month swept through  Shi'ite areas of Baghdad and southern Iraq, opening a new front  for U.S. forces already battling minority Sunni Muslims in  towns like Falluja, to the west, where most hostages have been  taken.<p> 
			
			"Currently we see a significant threat in the vicinity of  Najaf by the name of Moqtada al-Sadr and his militia," Kimmitt  told a news conference in Baghdad. "We will get the forces to  the place, at the time when it is necessary, to go after him  and his militia to end this violence -- it is that simple."<p> 
			
			Sadr's spokesman in Najaf said if U.S. troops went into the  city it would ignite mass violence across Iraq. "At the moment  they are facing an uprising, but if they harm Sadr a massive  revolution will take place all over Iraq," Qays al-Khazali told  a news conference.<p> 
			
			But a delegation of Shi'ite clerics who met Sadr said he  had hinted he would disband his militia if religious  authorities told him to do so, and had named an envoy to  negotiate with the Americans.<p> 
			
			HOSTAGE CRISIS<p> 
			
			The past week's kidnappings have lent a new dimension to  the Iraq conflict, snaring civilians from more than a dozen  countries, some of which -- like Russia, France and China --  opposed the war that ousted Saddam.<p> 
			
			Television pictures showed four men described as Italian  hostages seated on a floor surrounded by gunmen. Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi said Italy would do all it could to free them  but its mission in Iraq was "absolutely not under discussion."<p> 
			
			French television news agency Capa said one of its  reporters had been kidnapped south of Baghdad Sunday.<p> 
			
			France had urged its citizens to leave Iraq and postpone  any plans to travel there. Russia's biggest contractor in Iraq  said it was now evacuating all its 370 staff and Moscow said it  was ready to help all the roughly 500 Russians in Iraq to  leave.<p> 
			
			Seven Chinese seized near Falluja were freed Monday but  three Czech journalists were missing. The fate of three  Japanese hostages, threatened with death unless Japanese troops  pull out, remained unclear.<p> 
			
			Faced with spreading violence in Iraq, General John  Abizaid, commander of U.S. forces in the region, said he wanted  two more brigades to join the 145,000 U.S.-led troops already  there.<p> 
			
			President Bush said the drive to crush "lawlessness and  gangs" was vital for a planned handover of power to Iraqis on  June 30 and a transition to democracy. Bush was due to make a  televised address late Tuesday.<p> 
			
			FALLUJA FIGHTING<p> 
			
			Fresh clashes on the eastern edge of Falluja threatened a  shaky truce in the city, the scene of fierce fighting last week  between U.S. Marines and Sunni insurgents.<p> 
			
			Ahmed al-Ani, an official at Falluja's main hospital, said  fighting in the last eight days killed at least 625 people,  including about 20 in the past three days of sporadic gunfire.<p> 
			
			The Marines attacked rebels in Falluja last week in  response to the gruesome public murders of four Americans on  March 31.<p> 
			
			A U.S. helicopter was shot down near the town Tuesday and  the U.S. military said three crew were wounded.<p> 
			
			Fighting also broke out in Karma, near Falluja. A Reuters  photographer saw smoke billowing from the town after U.S. air  strikes. Locals said two women and three men had been killed.<p> 
			
			Armed insurgents emerged from muddy side streets and date  palm groves. "These cowards, the Americans, they are killing  families. They did not come here to liberate us from the  (Saddam) regime, they came to kill women and children," said  one guerrilla.<p> 
			
			The U.S. army said a roadside bomb attack on a convoy on  its way to Najaf from Baquba, north of Baghdad, killed a U.S.  soldier and wounded a soldier and a civilian contractor.<p>
