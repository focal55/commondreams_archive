<p> 
America could be close to a turning point in terms of the credibility of the Bush administration and public opinion on Iraq. As the fighting spreads and as doubt grows about Iraq and national security, the specter of the Vietnam war is being increasingly invoked. 
<p> 
New and startling revelations on George W Bush’s handling of Iraq and of terrorism are rocking the country almost daily. According to a top-secret memo about to be released, Bush was warned that al-Qaeda was trying to send operatives into the US for a bombing attack.
<p> 
The daily CIA briefing, on August 6, 2001, came a month before the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Although it did not mention the attacks specifically, the document was tussled over on Thursday when national security adviser Condoleezza Rice testified in front of the September 11 commission.
<p> 
Release of the “bin Laden memo” is yet another sign that the White House is on the defensive. The declassifying of what vice- president Dick Cheney has called the “family jewels” is simply unprecedented. The administration resisted fiercely for weeks.
<p> 
In August 2001, US intelligence also received uncorroborated reports that terrorists – including al-Qaeda – might fly an aircraft into an American embassy. The information was reportedly considered not credible enough to be passed on to Rice, or to the President.
<p> 
In the face of mounting criticism, White House spokesmen have had to defend Bush, currently on holiday at his Prairie Chapel ranch in Texas. His complete absence from the public stage, despite grave and fast-moving events in Iraq and Washington, has been dramatic and damaging politically.
<p> 
Bush is losing public support on Iraq, though less so on his perceived handling of terrorism. Recent opinion polls show a decrease in confidence in his presidency even over the last few days. In a CNN/Time survey released on Friday, Bush’s approval had dropped below 50% for the first time in his presidency. His re-election bid is based largely on his handling of the war and terrorism.
<p> 
American public mood, during wartime, is largely based on the domestic impact, said Professor John Lynn of the University of Illinois and former Oppenheimer chair of war-fighting strategy at the Marine Corps University in Virginia.
<p> 
“This administration has not been clear about what it’s doing and why,” he said. “We are being sucked in deeper, and we should have known.” 
<p> 
The dip in public opinion comes as the US plans to increase the number of troops in Iraq by an estimated one-sixth, or 20,000. Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld has tried to downplay the decision, which comes almost 11 months after Bush declared “mission accomplished” in Iraq in a blaze of publicity.
<p> 
Stark photographs of American deaths are also haunting the country, including a marine carrying a body bag and the burned corpses of the US security contractors. The administration has tried to muzzle such images. Media coverage of military body bags, which all arrive back via Dover air force base in Delaware, is banned – with disturbingly little outcry from the US press. Nor have Bush or senior members of the White House attended any military funerals.
<p> 
Lynn says that during Vietnam a key in the change in US public opinion was TV footage and photographs of the constant influx of soldiers’ bodies.
<p> 
“We’re at a tipping point in Iraq, with a real danger of losing control of the situation,” Sandy Berger, national security adviser to President Clinton, said in a recent radio interview.
<p> 
Criticism over the issue is coming from both sides of the political aisles though.’’ There’s not abject panic, but there’s deep concern, and there should be,’’ said congressman Chuck Hagel, a Republican.
<p> 
The increasing use of the “V word” is a gauge of America’s fear, confusion and anger. Although the death toll of Americans in Iraq is rising, the 600-plus dead is minuscule compared to the tens of thousands killed in Vietnam.
<p> 
The death toll in the Korean war was actually almost as high as in Vietnam, says the military historian Lynn. But the impact of Korea on domestic politics was minor, and the war is now almost forgotten.
<p> 
The Vietnam comparison is realistic, he says, in referring to the US people expecting a certain level of commitment and being dragged in far more deeply. Senator Robert Byrd recently became the second senior Democrat, after Ted Kennedy, to invoke the name.
<p> 
One year, and the equivalent of £67 billion, after the fall of Baghdad, he said the White House should be working towards an exit strategy for the US-led coalition. “Surely I am not the only one who hears echoes of Vietnam in this development,” he said.
<p> 
The most disturbing similarity is the deception, says Daniel Ellsberg, the main government whistleblower during Vietnam War.
<p> 
“We were lied into both wars, over the reasons for going in, the prospects, the length, the scale and the probable costs in lives and dollars,” says Ellsberg, who is considered the first major government whistle-blower of modern times. Henry Kissinger once dubbed him the “most dangerous man in America”.
<p> 
A former state department adviser, Ellsberg leaked classified “Pentagon Papers” in 1971 documenting mistakes, lying and fact-twisting about Vietnam during four presidencies.
<p> 
He observes a new trend, though, separating Iraq from Vietnam: nowadays some people do tell government secrets in a way once unthinkable. “We are beginning to get a lot of truth now, and people are genuinely horrified,” says Ellsberg, who travels the country lecturing. Information does not mean an end to a war, even if it becomes unpopular, he says. Not until 1975 did the US leave Vietnam, long after most Americans stopped supporting the war.
<p> 
On Iraq, he predicts: “The public will go in one direction – down – while number of troops goes the other way – upwards.”
