<p>Carole O'Hare, like others who lost family and friends Sept. 11, is 
watching the televised hearings about the terrorist attacks intently. And like 
some of those who have spent the past 2 1/2 years searching and begging and 
praying for answers, O'Hare said she noticed a disturbing trend in Tuesday's 
opening testimony: 
<P>"Not one person has come out and admitted there was a mistake made," said 
O'Hare, a Danville resident whose mother, Hilda Marcin, was on San Francisco-
bound United Airlines Flight 93 when it crashed into the countryside in 
Shanksville, Pa. 
<P>"When you have people covering their butts, they're not owning up to 
being human," O'Hare said. "People make mistakes."

What some Sept. 11 families want to hear out of these hearings is simple: 
Why did it happen? And what can be done so the symphony of errors, 
misjudgments and ignorance that preceded the attacks won't happen again? 
<P>They don't want to hear election-year political spinning.
<P>"I just hope we come out of these hearings with a more clear, resolute 
understanding of what needs to be done in our fight against terrorism," said 
Alice Hoglan of Los Gatos, whose son, Mark Bingham, was also on Flight 93. 
<P>The testimony of two secretaries of state and two defense secretaries 
didn't provide Hoglan with much new information Tuesday.
<P>"Of course, they were apologists for their respective administrations, 
and I understand that," said Hoglan, a retired flight attendant. "There seemed 
to be a lot of covering of body parts up there, if you know what I mean."
<P>Many Sept. 11 families already know much of the information that will be 
discussed in the federal hearings this week. 
<P>They've digested and dissected every morsel dropped in news stories about 
what happened, and they know much about the Middle East-U.S. relations in the 
years before and after the attacks. They know the players involved, from the 
undersecretaries to the hijackers, and are more familiar with the interagency 
infighting that hampered the flow of intelligence before Sept. 11 than 
probably anybody who isn't paid to know about it. O'Hare even has a copy of 
one of the hijacker's visas.
<P>They don't expect to get any sort of psychological healing. 
<P>"Emotionally, we're talking about 2 1/2 years later, now," O'Hare said. 
"There's no psychological term that I know of for that. I don't see any 
closure. The only thing I hope for out of this is that we learn something so 
it won't happen again."
<P>As she watched Tuesday's testimony, O'Hare called Cathy Stefani, a San 
Jose resident who lost her 21-year-old daughter, Nicole Miller, on Flight 93.

      REFUSES TO MEET PUBLICLY WITH 9/11 COMMISSION<br>

<!--/endimage/-->The two women speak weekly to each other, often spending hours on the 
phone discussing the latest Internet rumor or news story about the attacks. Or 
just consoling each other when one has had a rough day. 
<P>"This is our life now," said Stefani, who handles insurance billing for a 
doctor's office. "We didn't ask for this life, but this is what it is. And we 
do the best we can."
<P>
There's no respite from what happened that day. The families are 
confronted with daily reminders every time they see a magazine headline in the 
grocery store and nearly every time they turn on the TV. Tuesday's hearings 
were just another, more extensive example of Sept. 11's legacy. 
<P>Stefani said Tuesday's testimony, particularly by former Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright, shed light on "how long they had been trying to get 
Osama bin Laden."
<P>But they wonder how much the commission will be able to determine given 
that President Bush agreed to meet for only one hour  --  in private  --  with 
the commission's top two officials. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice 
won't testify publicly before the commission but will answer questions in 
private.
<P>"Condoleeza Rice is more than happy to go on the talk shows and spin her 
point of view, but why doesn't she go before the commission publicly?" O'Hare 
said. "And Bush, he's the big decision-maker. If he won't talk and take 
questions publicly, then who will?"
<P>William Kelly Sr. spent Tuesday in Washington at the hearings. He just 
wants answers  --  and for the proceedings to be as nonpolitical as possible.
<P>"A lot of people want to blame somebody for what happened," said Kelly, a 
New Jersey resident whose son, William Jr., died at the World Trade Center. 
"But there's no one person or agency that's responsible. I know there's a lot 
of people hurt and angry, but placing blame isn't going to bring a loved one 
back."
<P>O'Hare wonders if she'll be able to watch today's scheduled testimony by 
Richard Clarke, a military and counterterrorism adviser to four presidents. In 
his just-released book, Clarke said Bush and his top aides ignored the threat 
from al Qaeda before Sept. 11.
<P>"To know that there might have been something we could have done 
beforehand," O'Hare said. "That might be difficult to watch."
