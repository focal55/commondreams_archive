<p>WASHINGTON  -  When Democratic presidential candidate John
Kerry meets with independent rival Ralph Nader on Wednesday, Kerry
isn't likely to ask him to leave the race. And it's even less
likely that Nader will offer to bow out.
<p>   Kerry probably will point out that the two rivals share a goal  
ousting President Bush   and contend that a joint effort is the
best way to achieve it, aides to the Massachusetts senator said.
Nader, a Winsted, Conn. native, told The Associated Press that he
looks forward to discussing ''certain common policies'' with Kerry.
<p>   ''I think that's for the good of our country and for the benefit
of the American people that are being ignored or repudiated by the
Bush regime,'' Nader said in an interview.

Still, Kerry aides hope Nader eventually comes around to Kerry's
view   if not after the meeting, then following what senior
Democrats say will be a weeks-long campaign by party operatives to
pressure Nader publicly and privately. That effort, being
formulated by Democrats not aligned with the Kerry campaign, may
include challenging Nader's efforts to get on state ballots, the
Democrats said on condition of anonymity.
<p>   The national Reform Party endorsed Nader last week, a move that
gives him access to the ballot in at least seven states, including
the battlegrounds of Florida and Michigan.
<p>   Emerging as an issue between the two campaigns is the war in
Iraq. Nader is seeking to rally anti-war sentiment.
<p>   ''You can't have a discussion without talking about the war in
Iraq,'' said Nader. He has been critical of Bush and Kerry for not
outlining a plan to withdraw U.S. troops.
<p>   Kerry has been campaigning with former rival Howard Dean, who
made opposition to the war central to his campaign. Dean has warned
that a vote for Nader only helps Bush.
<p>   While Kerry voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq, he has
been critical of Bush's prosecution of the war.
<p>   While Nader and Kerry camps have been seeking the meeting for
some time, it developed quickly and top Kerry aides were meeting
deep into the night Tuesday and early Wednesday to map their
strategy, said officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
<p>   The relationship between the two camps is delicate, with some
fearing heavy pressure to exit could stiffen Nader to stay in the
race.
<p>   Kerry's advisers argue that the liberal Nader drains votes
mainly from Democrats and could end up tipping the balance to Bush.
<p>   Many Democrats argue that Nader cost Al Gore the White House in
2000, draining just enough votes from Gore to give Bush the closest
president election in history. Nader dismisses that suggestion,
saying Gore was a poor candidate.
<p>   Kerry has said he plans to reach out to Nader backers.
<p>   ''I respect him. I'm not going to attack him in any way,'' Kerry
said last month. ''I'm just going to try to talk to his people and
point out that we've got to beat George Bush. ... And I hope that
by the end of this race I can make it unnecessary for people to
feel they need to vote for someone else.''
<p>   Kerry's campaign also was releasing a campaign study on soaring
gasoline prices, showing the average family is paying $593 more for
gasoline since Bush took office, a total of $2,102 a year. Families
with teens were hit harder, seeing their costs grow by $834 a year.
<p>   Gasoline price spikes have cost farmers $1.3 billion, airlines
$7.5 billion and the trucking industry $6.3 billion, the study
said. Those prices have soared by 43.5 percent in Michigan, and 38
percent in Pennsylvania, the study said, breaking the hikes down by
states to offer ammunition in key battleground states.
