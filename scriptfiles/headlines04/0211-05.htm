<p>WASHINGTON  - Democratic presidential front-runner  John Kerry rolled to dominating wins in Virginia and Tennessee  on Tuesday, scoring a Southern sweep that knocked rival Wesley  Clark out of the race and put the nomination within reach.
<p> 
			
							Kerry, a Massachusetts senator, easily brushed aside two  Southerners, Clark of Arkansas and John Edwards of North  Carolina, to notch his first wins in the South and make the  case that he is a national candidate who can unify Democrats  and challenge President Bush in every region.<p> 
			
							"Americans are voting for change -- East, West, North and  now in the South," Kerry said at a victory rally in Fairfax,  Virginia. "We will fight for every vote, and we will carry our  cause all across this land."<p> 
			
							The sweep gave Kerry 12 wins in the first 14 Democratic  nominating contests and finished off Clark, the former NATO  commander and retired general who decided to end his campaign  after two poor third-place finishes on Tuesday.<p> 
			
							It also set up a crucial showdown next Tuesday in  Wisconsin, where Kerry's remaining rivals need a win to prove  their viability.<p> 
			
							Clark and Edwards, a freshman senator, focused on Virginia  and Tennessee all week in an effort to score strong enough  showings to propel them on to Wisconsin.<p> 
			
							But Kerry, whose campaign was considered dead barely a  month ago until he charged to a win in Iowa, earned more than  50 percent of the vote in Virginia. Edwards ran a distant  second and Clark a poor third.<p> 
			
							In Tennessee, Kerry scored more than 40 percent of the  vote, with Edwards 15 percentage points behind and Clark in  third place.<p> 
			
							Edwards flew to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to focus on the next  test after lowering expectations all week by saying he would be  happy with second-place finishes.<p> 
			
							He wants to be the last challenger to Kerry still standing  after Wisconsin, when the bulk of the delegates to July's  nominating convention will still be up for grabs.<p> 
			
							"We're going to have a campaign and an election -- not a  coronation," Edwards told supporters. He told CNN later that  "this race is going to go on for many weeks to come."<p> 
			
							Clark also had promised to push on to Wisconsin no matter  what happened on Tuesday, but after consultations with advisers  he pulled the plug. He planned to return to his hometown of  Little Rock, Arkansas, to formally withdraw on Wednesday, but  aides said he will remain active campaigning for the nominee.<p> 
			
							"We'll leave Tennessee even more full of hope and even more  committed to building a better America than when we began this  journey five months ago," Clark told supporters in Memphis,  Tennessee, less than an hour before pulling out.<p> 
			
							His withdrawal is a boost for Edwards, who had seen Clark  siphon off some of his support in states like Oklahoma and on  Tuesday in Virginia and Tennessee.<p> 
			
							DEAN LOOKS TO WISCONSIN<p> 
			
							Howard Dean, the one-time front-runner and former governor  of Vermont, looked past the two Southern states to concentrate  on Wisconsin, where he had promised to make a possible last  stand against Kerry. On Monday, he said he would stay in the  race past Wisconsin, win or lose.<p> 
			
							"The election next Tuesday is about whether you want to  stand up for a progressive America again," Dean, who finished  fourth in both Virginia and Tennessee, said at a Milwaukee  rally. "We are going to win Wisconsin."<p> 
			
							Kerry's only two losses on his drive to the nomination were  to Edwards and Clark last week in South Carolina and Oklahoma,  respectively. He has started looking ahead on the campaign  trail to the fight with Bush.<p> 
			
							He ignores his rivals at nearly every stop and concentrates  his attacks on the president's economic leadership, his ties to  special interests and his shifting justification for going to  war in Iraq.<p> 
			
							Kerry kept the heat on Bush in his victory speech on  Tuesday, attacking his economic policies and his record on  civil rights, civil liberties and national defense.<p> 
			
							"George Bush, who speaks of strength, has made America  weaker -- weaker economically, weaker in our health care,  weaker in education," Kerry said.<p> 
			
							Network exit polls showed Democratic voters were angry with  Bush and believed Kerry offered the best chance for a Democrat  to unseat him in November.<p> 
			
							Kerry's opponents still hope something will derail his  nonstop momentum and give them an opening, although Edwards has  not shown much interest in attacking him on the campaign trail.<p> 
			
							Even after the Wisconsin primary, which could amount to a  final showdown with Kerry, about 75 percent of the 4,322  delegates will remain to be chosen.
