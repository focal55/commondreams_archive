WASHINGTON  - President Bush reshuffled his advisory council on cloning and related medical issues on Friday, adding a prominent neurosurgeon known for his work on conjoined twins and two conservatives who have spoken out strongly against cloning. 
<p> 
He replaced one of the most prominent scientists on his
Council on Bioethics, cell biology expert Elizabeth Blackburn
of the University of California San Francisco. The Australian-
born Blackburn has spoken in favor of so-called therapeutic
cloning in which cloning technology is used for medical and
biological research.
 
<p>
 He also replaced William May, a prominent Christian
bioethicist and a former president of the American Academy of
Religion, now at the University of Virginia.
 
<p>
 The new members of the panel are Dr. Benjamin Carson of
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, a pediatric neurologist;
Peter Lawler, a government professor at Berry College in
George; and Diana Schaub, a political scientist at Loyola
College of Maryland.
 
<p>
 A White House spokeswoman said Blackburn's and May's terms
had expired. "We decided to appoint other individuals at this
point with different experience and expertise," she said.
 
<p>
 But supporters of therapeutic cloning said they were
stunned by the move and said it showed the White House was not
interested in hearing neutral scientific advice.
 
<p>
 "The American people deserve the right science, not
right-wing ideology, on critical issues facing their health,"
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democrat, said in a
statement.
 
<p>
 "By firing two of the committee's most distinguished
members, the administration is choosing once again the most
divisive and ideological course, instead of seeking consensus."
 
<p>
 FRIDAY NIGHT DECISIONS
 
<p>
 Daniel Perry, executive director of the Alliance for Aging
Research and president of the Coalition for the Advancement of
Medical Research, also expressed reservations.
 
<p>
 "We are concerned with this sort of Friday night late
decision to replace what we know is at least one of the
stronger voices on behalf of moving the research forward and
replacing her with what appear to be more ideological soulmates
who would reflexively oppose this research," Perry said in a
telephone interview.
 
<p>
 Earlier this month 60 leading scientists and philosophers,
including Nobel laureates, backed a Union of Concerned
Scientists report that accused the Bush administration of
distorting scientific advice to fit ideological goals.
 
<p>
 The White House denied this and said it was seeking a
variety of opinions on medical and scientific subjects.
 
<p>
 At issue is the future of stem cell research, which seeks
to harness the body's master cells to create new tissues to
treat diabetes, Parkinson's, cancer and a range of other ills.
 
<p>
 One approach would use cloning technology to try to find
ways to allow tailor-made treatments based on a patient's own
cells. Bush opposes this and has severely limited the use of
federal funds in such research.
 
<p>
 South Korean scientists announced earlier this month they
had cloned human embryos and extracted from them stem cells for
this very purpose, making clear they intend to continue with
the research.
