      <p>PARIS - World leaders at odds with George W. Bush are hoping he will change 
        his policies to rebuild global trust shattered by the Iraq war, but his 
        strengthened mandate means they could be the ones left making the changes. 
      <p>

 From Asia to Europe, foreign leaders mixed congratulations
for Bush with calls for him to soften what they regard as U.S.
unilateralism in world affairs.

But foreign governments also know that Bush's defeat of Democratic challenger 
        John Kerry is likely to reinforce his belief that he got it right over 
        Iraq and could convince him to stick to the policies that secured his 
        re-election. 
      <p>
 "The likelihood has to be that he will continue down the
same path, and that will inevitably cause quite severe
conflicts with European allies," said Christopher Hill of the
center of international studies at Cambridge University in
Britain.
 <p>
 "We continue to be in for a fairly rocky ride in
international relations."
 <p>
 Some European nations hope Bush's desire for political
support over Iraq, where he could face a long war and may need
to send more troops, will encourage him to make allowances to
Europe on other issues.
 <p>
 Difficulties over the large U.S. budget deficit and oil
prices could be reasons to take a more multilateral approach to
foreign affairs.
 <p>

 But the onus to shift course may be less likely to fall on
a president who just won re-election on the strength of his
tough policies.
      <p> "I believe that all Europeans, regardless of their views on Iraq, can see 
        that Bush has been re-elected. The next four years we have to do business 
        with President Bush and I think that pragmatic approach will influence 
        everyone," said Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. 
      <p>
 MUCH DEPENDS ON NEW TEAM
      <p> Some leaders hoping for changes are banking on Bush, like fellow Republican 
        President Ronald Reagan before him, showing some concern for how he goes 
        down in history -- as a man who united the world rather than one who divided 
        it. 
           <p> "If you want to be the world leader and you're loved by 51 percent of Americans 
        and no one else, then it's a problem. Based on that logic we could see 
        a kinder and gentler George Bush over the next four years," said Andreas 
        Falke, professor and head of the German-American Institute at Erlangen-Nuremberg 
        University. 
           <p> Much will depend on who Bush picks in his new team and how much influence 
        he allows Iraq war supporters such as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 
        and Vice President Dick Cheney. 
      <p>
 "If Rumsfeld is put back in place, if we have Rumsfeld and
Cheney, I think it is reasonable to assume that that no
softening is going to happen," said Stanley Crossick, founding
chairman of the Brussels-based European Policy Center.
 <p>

 "But it is also possible that people around him say, 'Bush
you are now a much stronger leader and strength does allow you
to speak in conciliatory terms'."
      <p> Political analysts say areas where differences with Bush are most likely 
        are over the war in Iraq, Iran's nuclear ambitions and possibly North 
        Korea's nuclear program. 
      <p>
 "I think we are in for a humdinger between Europe and the
U.S. over Iran," said Robin Niblett, executive vice president
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.

      <p> The United States accuses Iran of pursuing a nuclear program that could 
        produce a weapon in three to five years, and takes a tougher stance on 
        the issue than the European Union. 
      <p>
NO CHANGE SEEN IN WAR ON TERRORISM
<p>
Bush's strengthened mandate is widely thought likely to
rule out any major change in the war on terrorism.
<p>
"Bush will think it's a massive mandate and vindication of
his policies and his war on terror will go on and go on. It's
not going to be wound down," said Ayaz Amir, a political
commentator and newspaper columnist in Pakistan.
<p>
Many commentators in Asia hope Bush will consult widely
over North Korea, favoring six-party talks rather than a
unilateral approach to Pyongyang.
<p>
"In Bush's first term he had the Iraq problem, and it was a
mess. I think President Bush does not want the North Korean
problem to become the foreign policy problem of his second
term, the trouble of his second term," said Fu Mengzi of the
China Institute of Contemporary International Relations.
<p>
Most analysts say major changes are unlikely in Bush's
policy on the Middle East, where Washington is Israel's main
ally. But some commentators said changes could not be ruled out
if oil prices remain high.
<p>
"There is a possibility that Bush will change course. Not
due to calls from inside the Middle East but due to American
domestic reasons, in particular the American economic
situation," said Ihsan Bu-Hulaiga, a member of Saudi Arabia's
consultative Shura council.
