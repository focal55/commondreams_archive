WASHINGTON&nbsp; - Poor and minority children are likely to develop asthma at worsening rates due to global warming and air pollution, environment experts predicted on Thursday. 
<p>
 They released a report showing that as the climate gets
warmer, allergens such as pollen and mold will flood the air,
interacting with urban pollutants such as ozone and soot to
fuel an already growing epidemic of asthma.
<p>
 "It is affecting the trees, the molds, the subsurface
organisms," Dr. Paul Epstein of Harvard Medical School's Center
for Health and the Global Environment, told a news conference.
<p>
 "The combination of air pollutants, aeroallergens, heat
waves and unhealthy air masses -- increasingly associated with
a changing climate -- causes damage to the respiratory systems,
particularly growing children, and these impacts
disproportionately affect poor and minority groups in the inner
cities," the report reads.
<p>
 The report finds that asthma among U.S. preschool children,
age 3 to 5, grew 160 percent between 1980 to 1994.
<p>
 "This is a real wake-up call for people who think global
warming is only going to be a problem way off in the future or
that it has no impact on their lives in a meaningful way," said
Christine Rogers, a senior research scientist at the Harvard
School of Public Health.
<p>
 "The problem is here today for these children and it is
only going to get worse."
<p>
 Rogers, Epstein and the American Public Health Association worked together on the report.
<p>
 Most climate experts agree that the world is becoming
steadily warmer, and that human activity is much to blame.
Burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas releases carbon
dioxide into the air.
<p>
 INVISIBLE BLANKET
<p>
 The carbon dioxide forms a kind of invisible blanket that
traps the sun's radiation.
<p>
 While average temperatures warm, the effects are not
predictable and even. Storms may become more severe and some
areas may get colder weather.
<p>
 The report finds that in some regions, winter is ending
weeks earlier than before, and plants are releasing their
pollen earlier than ever, accelerating the hay fever season.
<p>
 Pollen and fungal spores can worsen asthma, a serious
medical condition whose symptoms include shortness of breath,
cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness.
<p>
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nine
million U.S. children have been diagnosed with asthma and more
than 4 million have had an asthma attack in the past 12 months.
It says 4,487 people died from asthma in 2000, most of them
adults.
<p>
 Asthma affects blacks more than any other group and affects
16 percent of children from poor families as opposed to 11
percent of children living above the poverty line.
<p>
 The CDC also says 9 million U.S. children were reported
with respiratory allergies in 2002.
<p>
 The report makes clear links among asthma, allergies and
urban air pollution.
<p>
"Rising levels of carbon dioxide, in addition to trapping
more heat, promote pollen production in plants, increase fungal
growth and alter species composition in plant communities by
favoring opportunistic weeds like ragweed and poison ivy," the
report reads.
<p>
"Diesel particulates help deliver and present pollen and
mold allergens to the immune system in the lungs," it adds.
<p>
"The good news is we can do something about this," Epstein
said. "Green" buildings with roof gardens to keep them cool and
insulation to keep heat from leaking would help, as would
improving public transport and encouraging the use of hybrid
vehicles that rely less on fossil fuels.
