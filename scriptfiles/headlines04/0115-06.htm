<p>LOS ANGELES --
In a forceful preview of the Bush administration's expansionist 
military policies in this election year, Vice President Dick Cheney Wednesday 
painted a grim picture of what he said was the growing threat of a 
catastrophic terrorist attack in the United States and warned that the battle, 
like the Cold War, could last generations.
<P>The vice president's tone, in a major address to the Los Angeles World 
Affairs Council, was sobering, unlike many other comments recently by senior 
administration officials that have stressed successes in the war on terrorism.
<P>Cheney mentioned only in passing the administration's domestic policies, 
while saying President Bush would present a blueprint of his domestic goals in 
next Tuesday's State of the Union speech.

<!--/endimage/-->Cheney devoted the half-hour speech to a frightening characterization of 
the war on terrorism and the new kind of mobilization he said it demanded. He 
sounded the alarm about the increasing prospects of a major new terrorist 
attack and the extraordinary responses that are required. While many of his 
remarks echoed past comments by the president and senior officials, Cheney 
struck a surprisingly dour note and suggested only an administration of proven 
ability could manage the dramatic overhaul necessary for the nation's security 
apparatus.
<P>"One of the legacies of this administration will be some of the most 
sweeping changes in our military, and our national security strategy as it 
relates to the military and force structure, and how we're based, and how we 
used it in the last 50 or 60 years, probably since World War II," Cheney said. 
"I think the changes are that dramatic."
<P>He also said the administration was planning to expand the military into 
even more overseas bases so the United States could wage war quickly around 
the globe.
<P>"Scattered in more than 50 nations, the al Qaeda network and other 
terrorist groups constitute an enemy unlike any other that we have ever faced,
" he said. "And as our intelligence shows, the terrorists continue plotting to 
kill on an ever-larger scale, including here in the United States."
<P>Cheney provided no details, however, of the kinds of attacks he expected.
<P>Although the administration has been criticized by some, including most 
of the Democratic candidates for president, for not doing enough to eliminate 
known programs for developing weapons of mass destruction in such countries as 
North Korea, Cheney said they were a priority and confronted the United States 
with its gravest threat.
<P>Again, he presented the risks of a terrorist attack involving these 
weapons in stark terms.
<P>"Instead of losing thousands of lives, we might lose tens or even 
hundreds of thousands of lives as the result of a single attack, or a set 
coordinated of attacks," Cheney said.
<P>While polls show that many Americans support the president's aggressive 
war on terrorism, he also has many critics for the way the battle has been 
waged. The president initially justified the war in Iraq by saying that Saddam 
Hussein had active programs to develop chemical, biological and nuclear 
weapons. The United States has yet to find evidence of such programs since 
overthrowing Hussein and installing a military occupation, prompting questions 
about the president's agenda and the quality of intelligence he is receiving.
<P>In addition, an expert at the U.S. Army War College, Jeffrey Record, 
recently released a 62-page analysis that concluded the war in Iraq might have 
set back American efforts to stop terrorists by diverting precious resources 
to a battle that will do little to prevent new attacks.
<P>As a result, Record concluded, the war on terrorism "lacks strategic 
clarity, embraces unrealistic objectives and may not be sustainable over the 
long haul."
<P>But in his speech Wednesday, Cheney compared this moment to the 
challenges faced by President Harry Truman at the beginning of the Cold War, 
when there was a hot war flaring on the Korean Peninsula and a long-term 
nuclear standoff developing with the Soviet Union.
<P>Cheney said Bush was establishing, as Truman had, a new structure for a 
new long-term war and spreading the military into new areas of the globe. "On 
Sept. 11, 2001, our nation made a fundamental commitment that will take many 
years to see through," Cheney said.</p>
