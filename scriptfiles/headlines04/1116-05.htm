<p>WASHINGTON -- All U.S. states and Washington, D.C. have narrowed the gap between wages earned by men and women, but no state has eliminated it, according to a study released on Tuesday.

<p>A report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a research group in Washington, D.C., said at the current pace of wage gains, it will be another 50 years before income earned by men and women is equal in the United States.

<p>The report used 2000 data from the U.S. Census Bureau and 2002-2003 data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly households survey conducted by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

<p>It found that nationwide, median wages for women in 2002 were 76.2 percent of men's wages. The group's first survey in 1996 showed that women in 1989 earned 68.5 percent of men's wages.

<p>"Things are better in some places and worse in others, but wherever you go in America, women are shortchanged, starting with their paychecks," said Heidi Hartmann, economist and president of the <a href="http://www.iwpr.org/" target="_new">Institute for Women's Policy Research</a>.

<p>Wage gap statistics have been criticized by some groups as inaccurate. For example, the National Center for Policy Analysis, a research group that advocates small government, said in a 2002 paper that women's "work-life patterns" and preference for jobs that offer more flexibility and benefits over high wages significantly affect their paychecks.

<p>"The 'wage gap' is not so much about employers discriminating against women as about women making discriminating choices in the labor market," the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote.

<p>According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research report, women in Washington, D.C., earned the most and came the closest to equity with men, earning 92.4 cents for every dollar earned by men for full-time, year-round work, the report said.

<p>The wage gap was widest in Wyoming where women earned 66.3 percent of men's wages, the study showed.

<p>In some states, the wage gap was wider when race was considered and black and Hispanic women were compared with white men. For example, Louisiana women earned 68.5 percent of what men earned, but black women in that state earned 48.9 percent of what white men earned.<p align="center">&copy; 2004 Reuters</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
