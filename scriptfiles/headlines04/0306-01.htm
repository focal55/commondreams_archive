<p>NEW YORK  - Warren Buffett, the world's
second-richest person, wants to pay more taxes. And he wants
the rest of corporate America to pay more too.

 In <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2003ar/2003ar.pdf" target="_new">his annual letter</a> to shareholders of his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. holding company, released on Saturday, the
73-year-old Buffett said Berkshire's taxes rose more than
eleven-fold to &#36;3.3 billion from 1995 to 2003, as profits rose
ten-fold to &#36;8.15 billion.
<p>
 
During the same period, federal income taxes paid by all
U.S. companies fell by 16 percent, to &#36;132 billion.
<p>
 "We hope our taxes continue to rise in the future -- it
will mean we are prospering -- but we also hope that the rest
of corporate America antes up along with us," said Buffett, who
has previously criticized Bush administration tax policy.
<p>
 Tax cuts won by President Bush, amounting to &#36;1.7 trillion
over 10 years, have helped push the federal budget deficit to
record levels, as have a weak economy and higher spending for
defense and domestic security.
<p>
 "Tax breaks for corporations -- and their investors,
particularly large ones -- were a major part of the
administration's 2002 and 2003 initiatives," Buffett said. "If
class warfare is being waged in America, my class is clearly
winning."
<p>
 Buffett's personal wealth is closely tied to his company.
Forbes magazine last month put Buffett's net worth at &#36;42.9
billion, most of which is in Berkshire stock. His wealth was
just behind that of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose
estimated net worth stood at &#36;46.6 billion.
<p>
 Buffett's letter, which is 21 pages long this year, is
highly anticipated by investors. Unlike most shareholder
letters seen as heavy with banalities, Buffett's are considered
fun to read and sometimes controversial.
<p>
 Last May, Buffett wrote a Washington Post opinion article
criticizing a key element of Bush's tax package -- a cut in tax
rates on corporate dividends. Buffett urged that any tax cuts
should go to lower-income people or others "who both need and
will spend the money gained."
<p>
 Buffett said corporate income taxes accounted for 7.4
percent of fiscal 2003 U.S. tax receipts. Except for 1983, that
was the lowest in the last 70 years, he said.
<p>
 The billionaire has not always been critical of anti-tax
politicians. Last year, he backed Arnold Schwarzenegger's
successful bid to become California's state's governor, despite
the actor's campaign pledge not to raise taxes to reduce the
state's mammoth budget deficit.
<p>
 Berkshire's &#36;3.3 billion tax payment "will almost certainly
place us among our country's top ten taxpayers," Buffett said.
That's a big change from 1944, when as a 13-year-old newspaper
carrier, Buffett filed his first personal tax return.
