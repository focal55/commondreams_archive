<p>AFGHANISTAN - Afghanistan's historic election was plunged into crisis after 14 of the 18 candidates claimed fraud and demanded voting be stopped, casting a pall over the enthusiasm of voters who turned out in force across the troubled country.

<p>An aide to Yunus Qanooni, the main challenger to President Hamid Karzai, said the opposition candidate was demanding a suspension of the first Afghan exercise in democracy for decades to prevent further fraud.

<p>Another challenger, Abdul Satar Sirat, said 14 candidates including Qanooni called for a halt following an early morning hitch when it appeared the ink meant to prevent multiple voting could be rubbed out.

<p>The electoral commission, which said the problem was a case of the wrong ink being used and had quickly been rectified, is examining the call "with all the attention it deserves," UN spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.

<p>"They took very seriously the statement by the candidates," he told a press conference.

<p>Qanooni's aide said the suspension call was also prompted by claims that polling stations had closed prematurely in areas populated by opposition supporters.

<p>Earlier voters had flocked to polling stations despite threats of violence from supporters of the former Taliban regime and the Al-Qaeda network.

<p>"I came here to elect my president on my own. The election marks the end of warlords and wars in my country," declared Hayam Udin, 50, in Kabul, echoing the hopes of countless fellow voters.

<p>The vote is a milestone in Afghanistan's road to recovery after a quarter-century of war capped by five years of harsh rule by the Taliban Islamic fundamentalist militia, who were ousted by US-led forces three years ago for harbouring Osama bin Laden after the September 11 terror attacks.

<p>The ballot is also a test for US President George W. Bush, who will take his controversial foreign policy to the polls in under a month.

<p>US officials have hailed the vote as a fulfilment of US promises of democracy, as they prepare for polls in Iraq in January.

<p>Karzai, who cast his vote under tight security in Kabul, said he was taking the ink problem seriously.

<p>"This is very important for our election....The important point is that all Afghans around Afghanistan are taking part in the elections," he said.

<p>Karzai, chosen as interim leader by a council of tribal leaders in June 2002, only managed one campaign rally. His first attempt at rallying the people was aborted by an assassination bid. His running mate also survived an assassination attempt in Afghanistan's north.

<p>The urbane 46-year-old is running against 17 other candidates, including one woman, a French-speaking poet and two warlords.

<p>Chief rival Qanooni is the favourite of the powerful anti-Taliban ethnic Tajik clique from the northern Panjshir Valley.

<p>With few policies in the campaign, most Afghans were expected to vote along ethnic lines, giving Karzai a strong chance as he hails from the southern Pashtun majority, shared by the former Taliban rulers.

<p>Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and Baluchis make up the rest of the mosaic of Afghanistan's tribes.

<p>Fears were high ahead of the poll that warlords, who still wield power through their private armies, would intimidate voters.

<p>The still-undersized Afghan army and police force are inadequate to guard all 5,000 polling booths so militiamen from warlords' private armies have been deployed in many areas.

<p>Backing up the local security forces are 27,000 foreign troops from a US-led coalition and NATO, to protect the 10.5 million registered voters.

<p>Only 230 international monitors are braving threats of Taliban violence, which has claimed 12 electoral workers' lives since May.

<p>"This is the most important day in the history of Afghanistan. Today we have the golden chance to vote that we have been waiting for for so long," Haji Abdul Salaam, 55, said in conservative southern city Kandahar.

<p>In the western city of Herat, roughly equal queues of men and women waited to cast their ballots at the Takiy school.

<p>"I was so happy I did not sleep," said Gholam Rezah, 55.

<p>The country was reported to be largely peaceful except for a firefight between US-led troops and militants south of Kabul in which three coalition troops were wounded, a coalition spokesman said.

<p>Some 350 kilogrammes of explosives were seized as they were being smuggled over the border from Afghanistan, he added.
