<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->UNITED KINGDOM - Yusuf Islam, the charity worker and pop singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, today arrived back in the UK saying he felt "victimised" by being barred from entering the US.
<P>His return followed a complaint by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, to the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, over his treatment. Mr Straw, in New York for the UN general assembly meeting, told Mr Powell "this action should not have been taken" over the former singer, who was known as Cat Stevens until 1977. <P>The Foreign Office, however, declined to confirm whether "this action" referred to Mr Islam's detention or his inclusion on a US security watch list. Yesterday, the Foreign Office had refused to become involved in the case, saying "the reasons for his detention and return are obviously a matter for the US, and not for us".<P>Mr Islam flew to Heathrow airport after being escorted from a London to Washington flight on Tuesday and interrogated by the FBI. His United Airlines flight was diverted 600 miles to Bangor, Maine after the US Transportation Security Agency was told that he was on board.<P>US officials said Mr Islam was on the watch list because of suspicions he was associated with potential terrorists. He was barred from entering Israel in 2000 following claims he had donated money to Hamas - a claim he denied - and last visited the US in May. <P>"I'm totally shocked," Mr Islam told reporters at Heathrow. "Everybody knows who I am. I am no secret figure. Everybody knows my campaigning for charity, for peace. There's got to be a whole lot of explanation."<P>The 56-year-old said he would be consulting his lawyers over the possibility of suing the US authorities for defamation. <P>"People make mistakes," he said. "I just hope they made a big mistake. We'll see ... half of me wants to smile and half of me wants to growl. The whole thing is totally ridiculous."<P>UK Muslim leaders condemned the US action. "The United States is shutting down its house, building walls around itself," Anas Altikriti, a spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain, said. <P>The US department for homeland security said the intelligence community had recently obtained information that "further heightens concern" about Mr Islam. "Yusuf Islam has been placed on the watch lists because of activities that could potentially be related to terrorism," spokesman Brian Doyle said. "It's a serious matter."<P>Another spokesman, Dennis Murphy, said the case highlighted the need for the US government to take over the task of checking airline passengers against watch lists. Currently, airlines can only check against no-fly lists, which contain fewer names.<P>US authorities maintained Mr Islam's name was also on the no-fly list United Airlines should have checked, although a spokesman for the airline maintained that "the information did not match".<P>Officials reviewing the list in the US discovered Mr Islam's name as his flight was in the air, resulting in the diversion to Maine.<P>"They diverted the plane at the last moment to a place called Bangor, which I'd never heard of, and suddenly I was surrounded by FBIs who interrogated me," Mr Islam said today. "I wasn't handcuffed or anything like that. They actually treated me very well. The one positive thing I can say is that a lot of security officers are pleased because they got my autograph."<P>Mr Islam's 21-year-old daughter, Maymanah, with whom he was travelling, was allowed to enter the US. "The whole thing was a terrible ordeal. I'm very tired," he said. "I was separated from my daughter. I really look forward to seeing her again."
