<p>LONDON - The violence rocking Iraq is hurting no one more than the weakest sections in 
the country.</b> 
<p>
                     Voluntary work has come to near standstill, and work that is still continuing 
is becoming difficult to monitor or control.

<p>
   Major charity organisations that had stepped in eagerly to carry out much 
needed relief work following the invasion of Iraq began to pull out after the 
bomb blast at the UN headquarters in Baghdad in September last year. Now 
skeleton services that remained have been shaken.

<p>
   "We put a stop on sending non-Iraqi staff into the region soon after the UN 
building was destroyed," Dominic Nutt from the charity Christian Aid told IPS. 
"That embargo has been reinforced in light of the recent events."

<p>
   Christian Aid has been working since then through Iraqi organisations and 
other organisations linked to their charity, Nutt said. "But we have problems 
monitoring our work, and so that makes it very difficult for us."

<p>
   The related organisations have been engaged in educational, humanitarian 
and human rights work, Nutt said. The organisation had begun to develop its 
work in the south after working actively in the Kurdish areas up north for the 
past ten years. But the new efforts made by the group are now jeopardised.

<p>
   The major charity Oxfam also withdrew its international staff months ago 
because of the security situation. "We still have local staff working to provide 
water pumps and clean water in several areas," a spokesman for Oxfam told 
IPS. But the development work is a fraction of what Oxfam would have liked to 
do.

<p>
   Oxfam is also providing funding to local agencies and other groups 
engaged in charity and developmental work within Iraq. The spokesman 
declined to offer details in view of the security situation.

<p>
   Charity and security evidently need to go together. Several major charity 
organisations never found Iraq safe enough even from day one. ActionAid 
took a political stand supporting a strong role for the United Nations, but did 
not put staff in on the ground.

<p>
   Tearfund, another major British charity, chose not to work within Iraq. "We 
are not working through any partners in Iraq either," a spokeswoman for the 
charity said.

<p>
   One of the busiest charities working within Iraq, Care International, is 
struggling to keep up its work.

<p>
   "Obviously our work is made more difficult in the situation, and we have to 
keep a very low profile," a spokesman for Care International told IPS. "Our 
staff are continuing as best as they can."

<p>
   Care International continues to run its office in Baghdad. Its staff there are all 
Iraqi nationals. "We do not want to publicise their work too much," the 
spokesman said.

<p>
   Several of the projects Care International has taken on had started before 
the war.

<p>
   These include water and sanitation projects in 14 governorates in central 
and southern Iraq. A well-developed project has been set up to improve the 
quality and availability of water in Diyala governorate. The charity has also 
taken up water projects in several towns within Iraq.

<p>
   The group is continuing to provide emergency medical supplies to hospitals 
through its medical staff.

<p>
   But after the attacks on the UN headquarters and on the Red Cross, the very 
act of doing good has become dangerous. Few major charities are now 
entering Iraq even indirectly.

<p>
   Cafod, a Catholic relief agency, is one of few charities that says it has 
actually stepped up work in the face of the violence.

<p>
   "We are engaged in considerable work through our partner Caritas Iraq," a 
spokeswoman for Cafod told IPS. Caritas Iraq is running its relief operations 
mainly through Oman.

<p>
   The organisation is also working with other partners in Jordan, Syria and 
Lebanon for a broader regional response, according to a statement from 
Cafod. 

<p>
   Its programmes in Iraq involve "long-term reconstruction and development 
of local villages and school systems, as well as a nationwide supplemental 
feeding program targeting children and women."
