<p>BOSTON - Lawmakers on Wednesday took a step toward making Massachusetts the first state to make comprehensive and affordable health care a constitutionally protected right. 

<p>The proposed amendment to the state's constitution was approved during a joint session of the House and Senate. If approved a second time during the 2005-2006 legislative session, the question will go before voters in 2006. 


<p>The amendment states that "it shall be the obligation and duty of the Legislature and executive officials ... to enact and implement such laws as will ensure that no Massachusetts resident lack comprehensive, affordable and equitably financed health insurance coverage for all medically necessary preventive, acute and chronic health care and mental health care services, prescription drugs and devices." 


<p>"We're trying to provide justice in health care so that every single citizen has a health care plan," said Sen. Steven Tolman, D-Boston. 


<p>The proposed amendment was initiated when more than 70,000 registered voters signed a petition. As a result, only 51 of the 200 state representatives and senators need support the proposal for it to go before voters. 


<p>The vote Wednesday was overwhelming, with lawmakers approving it 153-41. 


<p>Supporters argue that the cost of providing universal coverage through a variety of public and private means could be made up by eliminating billions of dollars in unnecessary costs currently built into the state's health care system. 


<p>The National Federation for Independent Business said the price tag of providing health care to all citizens would be immense.
