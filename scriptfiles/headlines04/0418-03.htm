SANTA CRUZ &#151; If you had a craving for a Bush Is Nuts Brownie or a Condoleezza Rice Crispy Treat on Saturday, then one of six bake sales across the county would have been a choice spot.
<p> 
 Volunteers determined to unseat President Bush in November&#146;s election offered cake and cookies in exchange for donations to MoveOn, the political action committee for MoveOn.org &#151; the group that made headlines when CBS 
 refused to air its anti-Bush ad during February&#146;s Super Bowl.<p> 
 The Berkeley-based group called on people across the country who are fed up with the current administration to raise money for their advocacy efforts by holding community bake sales. More than 1,100 bake sales were held nationally, 
 according to organizers.<p> 
 Local organizers, who were still counting proceeds Saturday evening, reported that one of the busiest sales, in front of O&#146;Neills surf shop in downtown Santa Cruz, raised &#36;3,400. Tallies at bake sales in Boulder Creek, Felton, Aptos, 
 Capitola and at Main Beach in Santa Cruz were pending. A bake sale was held in Watsonville on Friday.<p> 
 Nationwide, organizers say they made an estimated &#36;250,000 Saturday.<p> 
 Volunteer Holly Hess, who coordinated the sale in downtown Santa Cruz with her husband Bill, said she was happy to labor in the kitchen this weekend and organize the event if it improves chances that the president will leave office.<p> 
 &quot;We want Bush defeated because we want leadership that acknowledges that we live in a global society,&quot; she said, before citing a number of failures she associates with the administration on issues of Iraq, women&#146;s rights 
 and the environment. <p> 
 MoveOn.org, in all its fund-raising success &#151; bringing in &#36;17 million since October &#151; has been plagued by accusations that its efforts have been in violation of campaign finance law.<p> 
 MoveOn.org officials have flatly denied wrongdoing.<p> 
 Aptos resident Maia Zohara, who was selling chocolate chip cookies with her son Jorel, 11, Saturday said that MoveOn.org has given her and others a real political voice.<p> 
 &quot;They&#146;ve reactivated democracy by taking it back to the streets and to the people,&quot; she said.<p> 
 The advocacy group was founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Wes Boyd and Joan Blades and claims a membership of 2.3 million people.<p>
