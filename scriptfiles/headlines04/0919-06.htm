The PUPians attempted to beat the Guinness records of the Malta Archipelago and the Hongkong Polytechnic University (HPU) which organized 11,750 individuals in November, 2003 and 11,500 in 2002, respectively, for the same purpose. 
<p>PUP acting President Samuel Salvador said that PUP’s numbers will still be validated by representatives from the Guinness Book of World Records to confirm if it broke Malta Islands’ and HPU’s records.
<p>"So far, this is the longest human rainbow formation in history."
<p>Aside from breaking the world record, Salvador said their "human rainbow" also aims to unite all PUPians now celebrating its centennial year (1904 to 2004). It also intends to raise funds to finance the projects of the PUP Centennial Foundation geared towards the improvement of its facilities. 
<p>"PUP is among the state universities in the Philippines with the lowest tuition, but has produced professionals and leaders who are now working hand in hand with the government in uplifting the quality of lives of the Filipinos. Given the fiscal crisis, we have to raise funds if we are to provide our students with a conducive learning environment," he said.
<p>The event was highlighted by the signing of the Declaration of Peace.It will be submitted to the United Nations to enjoin all universities in the world to integrate in their curricular programs a comprehensive subject that will study and address the problems of global violence, poverty and exploitation, and develop good citizens for universal peace.
<p>"The human rainbow will not only place our university on the world map. It will also convey a timely message to the rest of the world that, as a National Comprehensive University, we are sincere in taking up an international agenda that will pursue along the widening global patch dedicated to lasting solutions to violence, inequality and exploitation," said Salvador.
<p>Among those who witnessed the event were Manila Mayor Lito Atienza, his wife Bheng, religious leader Bro. EddieVillanueva, and Philippine International Trading Corp. Chairman Roberto Pagdanganan.</P>
