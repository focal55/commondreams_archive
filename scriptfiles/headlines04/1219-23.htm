 <p align="left">To hear officials in Washington tell it, the Bush administration was 
merely trying to support the burgeoning civil society in Ukraine when it 
funneled $57.8 million to the former Soviet republic over the last two years.
<P>But the governments in Kiev and Moscow, using classic Cold War terms, 
have lambasted the United States for spending millions of dollars to influence 
Ukraine's presidential elections. 
<P>The complicated truth, analysts say, is that in Ukraine, where civil 
society has eroded over the last decade under the quasi-authoritarian, corrupt 
government of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma, the fine line between 
promoting democracy and meddling in the country's internal affairs often 
becomes blurred.
<P>A number of U.S. government-sponsored and private organizations  --  
among them, the National Democratic Institute, Freedom House and U.S. Agency 
for International Development  --  spent millions of American taxpayers' 
dollars to aid Ukrainian groups that eventually helped bring about the Orange 
Revolution. Thousands of protesters poured into the streets, leading to 
overturning suspect results favoring Ukraine's pro-Kremlin government 
candidate Viktor Yanukovych over Viktor Yushchenko, who was backed by the pro-
Western opposition.
<P>"Our candidate is the Ukrainian people, and we're supporting their right 
to a free and fair vote," said one State Department official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. The State Department spends about $1 billion a year to 
support pro-democracy activities worldwide. 
<P>Anatol Lieven, an expert on the former Soviet Union at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace, says the donor organizations got caught up 
in the rift between those in Ukraine who staunchly support the country's 
increasingly authoritarian government and those who want the nation of 49 
million people to become a Western-style democracy  --  and are, by default, 
associated with the opposition.
<P>As a result, supporting "a free and fair vote" inadvertently became 
tantamount to backing the opposition, Lieven said.
<P>U.S. support of "voter education initiatives, youth activist groups and 
parallel counts has favored ... Yushchenko," said Pavel Erochkine, an expert 
on Ukraine at the Centre for Global Studies, a British think tank. 
<P>This has enraged Yanukovych, Ukraine's prime minister, who accused 
Washington of "financing Yushchenko's campaign."
<P>What makes the United States particularly vulnerable to criticism of 
trying to manipulate Ukraine's elections is its position toward the former 
Soviet state, analysts say. The Bush administration sees Ukraine as a 
potential NATO member and a buffer zone between Russia and the West, while 
Russia seeks to re-establish its traditional hegemony over the Texas-size 
state. 
<P>Officials at American organizations that ran programs in Ukraine say 
their only political agenda was making the election democratic and fair. 
<P>"All the effort that has been made on the part of organizations like ours 
and on behalf of the U.S. government was to support the process, not an 
outcome," said Ken Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute, 
which spent approximately $2 million training Ukrainians on how to organize 
political parties, how to monitor elections and, in coordination with Freedom 
House, bringing 1,000 election observers from 16 countries in the region. 

<P>Wollack said his institute offered training to individuals and political 
parties "across the political spectrum."
<P>But groups and individuals who support the Ukrainian government and trust 
its ability to hold elections usually see no need in parallel counts and 
independent observers, and rarely apply and participate in such training, said 
Fiona Hill, an expert on the former Soviet Union at the Brookings Institution 
and former director for strategic planning at the Eurasia Foundation, a group 
that promotes democracy in the region.
<P>"People self-select, and this self-selection is portrayed (by the 
Ukrainian government) as direction, that somebody is sitting in the State 
Department orchestrating all this," Hill said. "No, they're not. They are 
playing catch-up."
<P>Election monitors trained by the National Democratic Institute "have been 
subject of intimidation and harassment over the years," Wollack said. "It's 
not easy when groups ... stand up and challenge actions by authorities, and 
expose improper behavior of authorities. They have courageously done that." 
<P>John Kubiniec, Freedom House's regional director for Central and Eastern 
Europe, said Ukrainian authorities have intimidated election observers his 
group had trained. Kubiniec also said employees of Freedom House's Kiev office 
are "being observed, our phones are tapped, our electronic communications 
monitored, and we are being followed."
<P>Here, Ukraine might be following the example of Russia, where President 
Vladimir Putin, an ex-KGB spy who energetically supported Yanukovych, has said 
that groups promoting democracy that receive funds from overseas are foreign 
spy cells in disguise. 
<P>"Putin and Yanukovych come from a very Soviet political culture; they 
don't understand the concept of civil society," said Taras Kuzio, an expert on 
Ukraine at George Washington University who monitored the Nov. 21 election and 
will be an observer at the Dec. 26 rerun. 
<P>That gives all the more reason to the United States to continue funding 
projects that promote democracy in the region, said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San 
Carlos, the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee.
<P>"All of this activity is undertaken to help create a more secure and 
stable world where the will of the people can be expressed through their 
governments," Lantos said. "This is not merely altruistic, but also in the 
interest of the United States."
