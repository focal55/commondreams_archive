<p>WASHINGTON - A group of 49 retired U.S. generals
and admirals is urging President Bush  to postpone the scheduled
deployment this year of a multibillion dollar missile shield
and spend the money instead on securing potential terror
targets.
<p>
 In a letter to be released at a news conference Friday, the
officers, including retired Admiral William Crowe, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1985 to 1989, described the
complex technology as untested and a poor use of scarce defense
dollars.
<p>
 "As you have said, Mr. President, our highest priority is
to prevent terrorists from acquiring and employing weapons of
mass destruction," said the letter made available to Reuters.
<p>
 As the "militarily responsible course of action," the
signers urged funds earmarked for missile defense go instead to
bolster nuclear weapons depots and protect U.S. ports and
borders against terrorists.
<p>
 Bush has asked Congress for &#36;10.2 billion for missile
defense in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, a 13 percent
increase from the year before. Over the next five years, the
administration plans to spend &#36;53 billion on the project.
<p>
 The shield's initial goal is to protect against one or two
warheads that could be launched by North Korea. But in their
letter the retired brass said the United States already was
able to pinpoint the source of a ballistic missile launch.
<p>
 "It is, therefore, highly unlikely that any state would
dare to attack the U.S. or allow a terrorist to do so from its
territory with a missile armed with a weapon of mass
destruction, thereby risking annihilation from a devastating
U.S. retaliatory strike," they wrote.
<p>
 A spokeswoman for Bush, Claire Buchan, had no immediate
comment on the letter, which included among its signers Gen.
Joseph Hoar of the Marines, a former commander of the U.S.
Central Command, and Gen. Alfred Hansen, who headed the Air
Force's logistics command.
<p>
 The Pentagon's top space planner told Congress on Thursday
that a key part of the planned missile defense shield would
cost more and take longer to field than currently scheduled.
<p>
 The Space-Based Infrared System built by Lockheed Martin
Corp. "is in a fluid situation right now," said Air Force Under
Secretary Peter Teets.
<p>
 The system is meant to detect enemy missile attacks and
collect a range of technical intelligence. It involves a
network of four satellites in geosynchronous orbit and two in
highly elliptical orbit.
