The former UN weapons inspector and now governor of Tasmania, Richard Butler, was at the center of controversy yesterday after accusing George Bush of reserving the right to "beat the living daylights" out of any country regarded as posing a threat.
<P>Mr Butler is officially the Queen's representative in Tasmania and, as such, is supposed to avoid political comment.</P>
<P>But his appointment last year always carried a risk, given the long list of rows behind him.</P>

The Mercury newspaper in Hobart yesterday carried a report of his lunchtime speech to businesspeople in which he said the US presidential election four years ago "resulted in the installation of the most highly nationalistic and self-centered government we have known. Their election promise was to be more selfish, more self-centered, more determined to use American power for their interests - and they have kept their promise.</P>
<P>"In a world fearful of terrorism and with only one superpower, US concerns dominated - the Bush doctrine."</P>
<P>He said the US administration's view was: "In this new world, we Americans reserve the right to go anywhere, anytime, to beat the living daylights out of anyone who threatens us."</P>
<P>His comments run counter to the Australian prime minister, John Howard, who, like Tony Blair, backed President 
 Bush in the war against Iraq. Although Mr Butler, when he was the UN's chief weapons inspector in Iraq, frequently warned that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction, he opposed Australia's involvement in the war.</P>
<P>Mr Butler said that in a world in which countries cooperated as part of the UN, no country, no matter how powerful, had the right to invade another.</P>
<P>"The US has torn up international law about who may attack whom," he said.</P>
<P>Mr Butler's office issued a statement yesterday insisting his speech had not been accurately reported: "The governor is deeply disappointed that his wide-ranging speech on international affairs _ was not reported more fully. He cautions those who were not pre sent to be wary of drawing conclusions on the basis of one media outlet's interpretation."</P>
<P>But the leader of the state opposition Liberal party, Rene Hidding, said Mr Butler should not have made such comments in his present job.</P>
<P>"Accusing a foreign government of total self-interest, of being the most nationalistic and self-centered government we have known, and of tearing up international law, are highly provocative and extremely political statements in anyone's language," he said.</P>
<P>According to the Mercury, Mr Butler warned Australians to be wary about the exploitation of terrorism by politicians.</P>
<P>He described the threat as "immensely convenient for western politicians who want to remain in power" and said: 
 "They want to frighten the living daylights out of you." He added: "I think you should be extremely careful of being manipulated by politicians."</P>
<P>Mr Butler was Australian ambassador to the UN from 1992 to 1997 and head of the UN inspections team in Iraq from 1997 to 1999.</P>
