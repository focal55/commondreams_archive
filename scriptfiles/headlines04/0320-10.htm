<p>Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described the US-led war in Iraq as a "great mistake" that increased the risk of terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Invading Iraq was a "great mistake that led to more terrorism and not the prevention of this scourge," Gorbachev said at a conference on threats to peace hosted by Anahuac University on the outskirts of Mexico City.</p>

The United States on Friday marked the first anniversary of the war, which it launched arguing it was part of its "war on terror."</p>
<p>But the war has brought "severe consequences," said Gorbachev, who led the Soviet Union from March 1985 to December 1991, when the 15-republic Communist superpower was dissolved.</p>
<p>"Every day we witness the consequences of the erroneous invasion of Iraq," he said to the applause of 5,000 people at the university.</p>
<p>Democracy cannot be achieved by military force, he added.</p>
<p>"Democracy is not imposed with tanks and missiles, but with respect of other peoples and international law," Gorbachev said.</p>
<p>The war has also wounded US relations with traditional allies, the former Soviet leader said.</p>
<p>"Nobody doubts the economic, military and democratic power of the United States," he said. "We recognize this and that (Washington) can be a world leader. But we do not believe in leadership through domination."</p>
<p>"There is no other path than through the respect of international law and cooperation," he continued. "Anything else would be a great danger to the rest of the world."</p>
