<p>BANGKOK - A frail-looking but persuasive Nelson 
Mandela urged world leaders to increase funding to combat HIV/
AIDS and to raise global awareness about the dangers of the 
disease.
</b> 
<p>
                     Speaking at the 15th International AIDS Conference on 
Thursday, 
the former South African president took the opportunity to 
introduce 
his 46664 Global Campaign a program he started last 
November to focus attention on HIV/AIDS.

The six-day conference in the Thai capital has attracted over 
15,000 delegates.
<p>
   ''My prison number on Robben Island (near Cape Town in 
South 
Africa) was 46664. Despite the efforts of the apartheid regime to 
reduce us to prison numbers and so reduce our humanity, the 
world 
did not forget us,'' Mandela said.
<p>
   The <a href="http://46664.tiscali.com/" target="_new">46664 Global Campaign</a>, he said, will focus on creating 
more 
international awareness, advocating for and supporting care, 
treatment and prevention, and intensifying efforts to raise 
urgently 
needed funds.
<p>
   ''As former prisoner number 466664, there is a special place in 
my 
heart for all those that are denied access to their basic human 
rights,'' Mandela told delegates at the conference.
<p>
   He said American singer Dionne Warwick had joined the 
46664 
campaign as an ambassador, while Richard Gere, a Hollywood 
actor-turned-activist, has also gone on board.
<p>
   On Thursday, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 
announced a 
50 million U.S. dollar contribution to the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria.
<p>
   But Mandela said that much more funding was needed.
<p>
   Earlier in the day, Mandela's sudden appearance at a news 
conference had caught many journalists off guard.
<p>
   The media had been expecting him to speak on Wednesday, 
but 
instead his wife, Graca Machel, chaired a panel on the activities 
of 
the Nelson Mandela Foundation, a non-governmental 
organization 
(NGO) based in Johannesburg
<p>
   This sent a confused signal that the 86-year-old statesman 
might 
not have been able to make it to Bangkok.
<p>
   Mandela, South Africa's first black president had announced 
his 
retirement from public life at the end of May.
<p>
   ''Don't call me; I will call you,'' he had said then, explaining that 
he 
would be spending more time at his rural home, reflecting, 
attending to family and friends and writing a second book about 
his 
life since he was released in 1990 after 27 years in prison.
<p>
   His appearance at the media center of the AIDS conference 
thus 
caused frenzy, as photographers and journalists scrambled for 
a 
space in the crammed conference room. 
<p>
   Amid a tight police escort, Mandela was greeted with 
deafening 
applause and a standing ovation from all present.
<p>
   Then the world's most famous political prisoner got down to 
business. He delivered a one-page statement on ''Confronting 
the 
Joint HIV-TB Epidemics'', at a conference session organized by 
the Bill and Melinda 
Gates 
Foundation.
<p>
   ''We cannot win the battle against AIDS if we do not also fight 
TB 
(tuberculosis). TB is too often a death sentence for people with 
AIDS,'' Mandela stated.
<p>
   He said doctors have known how to cure TB for more than 50 
years.
<p>
   ''What we have lacked is the will and the resources to quickly 
diagnose people with TB and get them the treatment they need,'' 
he 
said.
<p>
   He expressed delight that the Gates Foundation had 
announced a 
44.7 million U.S. dollar grant to support the Consortium to 
Respond 
Effectively to the AIDS-TB Epidemic (CREATE) - comprising a 
body 
of international agencies.
<p>
   ''I hope this research will give us new weapons to fight TB in 
places that have been hard hit by AIDS,'' Mandela said.
<p>
   Because HIV weakens the immune system, people with the 
virus 
are especially vulnerable to tuberculosis, and TB rates have 
increased significantly in countries with a high HIV/AIDS 
prevalence.
<p>
   Of the estimated 1.6 million deaths caused by tuberculosis 
annually, one quarter occur among people living with HIV/AIDS.
<p>
   Tuberculosis is now the leading killer of people with HIV 
worldwide, according to Helene Gayle, director of the HIV, TB, 
and 
Reproductive Health program at the Gates Foundation.
<p>
   The Foundation's figures show that 14 million people in the 
world 
are infected with both HIV and TB, and 70 percent of them live in 
sub-Saharan Africa.
<p>
    During the news conference, Mandela acknowledged the 
presence of Zambian campaigner Winstone Zulu, a TB survivor, 
who shared a platform with him.
<p>
   ''There have been so few TB survivors who have stepped 
forward 
to share their stories. We need more advocates like Winstone to 
tell 
the world about TB and the effect it has on so many millions of 
people,'' he said.
<p>
   Mandela, himself, is no stranger to TB.
<p>
   ''I was in jail (1964-1990) when they took a specimen of my 
sputum and sent it to hospital. I was diagnosed with TB,'' he 
said.
<p>
   ''When the report came back from hospital they indicated that 
fortunately they sent the specimen before there were holes in the 
lung,'' added Mandela.
<p>
   ''It would take only about four months to treat the TB if I treated it 
correctly. I went to my friends in prison, and told them that I was 
found to have the TB germ. There were long faces drawn,'' he 
revealed.
<p>
   Mandela said his prison mates objected to him sharing his 
personal effects with them.
<p>
   ''But I consoled them and told them that the doctors and 
hospital 
staff knew about my status. And, I, therefore, had no reason to 
hide 
this information from those close to me,'' he said.
<p>
   ''I underwent treatment and was completely cured after four 
months,'' added Mandela.
<p>
   Mandela was accompanied to Bangkok by his loyal personal 
assistant, Zelda la Grange, an Afrikaner, whose kinsmen 
introduced 
apartheid and jailed him on Robben Island for opposing the 
system.
