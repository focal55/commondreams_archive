<p>MOSCOW - Russia summoned a U.S. diplomat to
protest at a Pentagon  claim that Russian soldiers spirited away
hundreds of tons of explosives from a site in Iraq  just before
the U.S. invasion, Interfax news agency said on Friday.
<p>
 The missing cache of explosives has become a political hot
potato in the U.S. election race, with Democratic challenger
John Kerry  accusing the administration of President Bush  of
failing to secure the site.
<p>

 In a Washington Times story this week, Pentagon official
John Shaw pointed the finger at Russian special forces, saying
they had moved many of Iraq's weapons into Syria in the weeks
before the March 2003 invasion.
<p>

 "The Russian Ministry of Defense summoned the U.S. military
attache in Moscow to express a resolute protest in connection
with the comments by John Shaw," Interfax quoted an anonymous
source at a Russian defense agency as saying.
<p>

 A spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Moscow confirmed that a
member of the embassy's defense staff had been "called in," but
denied it was the chief military attache and declined to say
what had been discussed at the meeting.
<p>


 Russia's Defense Ministry dismissed the allegation that
there had been any Russian involvement in the disappearance of
the explosives in Iraq.
<p>

 "You can't really take statements like this as anything but
far-fetched rubbish," said spokesman Vyacheslav Sedov.
<p>

 "I can officially confirm that the Ministry of Defense and
the organizations that report to it could not have taken part
in the disappearance of the explosives, since Russia's
servicemen and military specialists left Iraq 12 years ago."
<p>

 Bush and Pentagon officials have argued that Saddam
Hussein's government may have moved the explosives from the Al
Qaqaa storage site near Baghdad before the start of the war to
protect it from U.S. attack.
<p>

 But Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has distanced himself
from the comments by Shaw, who is deputy undersecretary for
defense for international technology security.
