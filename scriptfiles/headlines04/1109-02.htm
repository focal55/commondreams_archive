<p> PARIS - The fate of Palestinian President Yasser  Arafat was mired in confusion on Tuesday as French doctors  contradicted reports by senior Palestinian officials that the  veteran leader had died at a Paris hospital.<p> 
			
			Several political sources said Arafat, 75, in a coma for  the past six days, had succumbed to the mystery illness that  led to his being flown to Paris from the West Bank on Oct. 29,  thrusting his Palestinian Authority into crisis.<p> 
			
			"He is dead. It is possible they will delay the  announcement," one Palestinian source said. "He died after  bleeding in the brain began last night. His bodyguards started  hugging and kissing and telling each other to be strong."<p> 
			
			But a spokesman for French medical services insisted Arafat  was still alive, saying: "Mr. Arafat is not dead."<p> 
			
			Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath told CNN from  Paris that Arafat was alive and no decision has been made to  take him off life-support.<p> 
			
			The flurry of conflicting reports surfaced during a visit  to Paris by a delegation of three senior Palestinian officials,  all seen as potential successors to Arafat, to check on the  Palestinian leader despite his wife's angry objections.<p> 
			
			In four decades leading the Palestinian nationalist cause,  Arafat has gone from guerrilla icon to Nobel prize-winning  peacemaker to a shunned old leader facing renewed bloodshed  with Israel.<p> 
			
			Arafat has been in a coma brought on by a still-undisclosed  illness, with his dream of a Palestinian state unrealized, a  possible succession battle brewing and the threat of chaos in  Palestinian territories looming.<p> 
			
			He has been widely admired by Palestinians as the father of  their struggle for statehood but was reviled by many Israelis  as the face of terror.<p> 
			
			Both sides have wondered whether his death might serve as  the catalyst for first real peace effort in years or plunge the  region into deeper crisis.<p> 
			
			SWIFT DECLINE<p> 
			
			Arafat had been flown to the Paris military hospital from  his battered West Bank headquarters where he had been  effectively confined by Israel for more than two and a half  years.<p> 
			
			Despite his reputation as a consummate survivor, Arafat's  decline came swiftly and with little warning.<p> 
			
			Initial claims that he was suffering from a stomach ailment  soon gave way to widespread reports that he had slipped into a  coma and that his organs were failing.<p> 
			
			French doctors kept a tight lid on details of Arafat's  condition at the behest of his wife, Suha, who engaged in a war  of words with senior Palestinians officials over her virtual  monopoly on information from his hospital bedside.<p> 
			
			But on Tuesday, as the officials arrived in Paris to check  on Arafat, doctors said he had slipped deeper into a coma.<p> 
			
			The delegation including Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie, Shaath  and Palestine Liberation Organization Secretary General Mahmoud  Abbas arrived at the hospital after France hinted it was losing  patience with the visit dispute.<p> 
			
			The hospital had ruled out leukemia but had not given any  diagnosis of Arafat's illness. Palestinian officials said he  had suffered from liver failure.<p> 
			
			All three leaders who flew into Paris on Monday are  potential successors and Arafat's wife had accused them of  wanting to "bury him alive." Shaath said the delegation wanted  to get the full facts on Arafat.<p> 
			
			Despite the bickering, Secretary of State Colin Powell said  on Monday he was impressed by the Palestinian leaders' handling  of Arafat's absence and said he hoped the "relative calm" in  the region would continue.<p> 
			
			"I hope that sense of quiet and calm can be maintained and  (that) it gives us something to work with," Powell told  reporters on the way to Mexico. He reiterated that the United  States was "ready to engage as soon as it is appropriate to  engage" with the so-called road map peace plan.<p align="center">
