<p>WASHINGTON -- U.S. soldiers in Iraq are killing themselves at a high rate despite the work of special teams sent to help troops deal with combat stress, the Pentagon's top doctor said yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about 2,500 soldiers who have returned from the war on terrorism are having to wait for medical care at bases in the United States, said Dr. William Winkenwerder, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. The problem of troops on "medical extension" is likely to get worse as the Pentagon rotates hundreds of thousands of troops into and out of Iraq this spring, he said.</p>
<p>Both situations illustrate the stresses placed on the troops and the military's health system by the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., accused the Bush administration of lying about the reasons for attacking Iraq, and said the war has not made Americans safer.</p>
<p>Kennedy seized on the comments by former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who delighted war critics and annoyed the White House when he said over the weekend that the administration was mulling Saddam Hussein's ouster soon after President Bush took office.</p>
<p>"O'Neill has now revealed what many of us have long suspected, that despite protestations to the contrary, the president and his senior aides began the march to war in Iraq in the earliest days of the administration, long before the terrorists struck this nation on 9/11," Kennedy said in a speech before the liberal Center for American Progress.</p>
<p>Suicide has become such a pressing issue that the Army sent an assessment team to Iraq late last year to see if anything more could be done to prevent troops from killing themselves. The Army also began offering more counseling to returning troops after several soldiers at Fort Bragg, N.C., killed their wives and themselves after returning home from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Winkenwerder said the military has documented 21 suicides during 2003 among troops involved in the Iraq war. Eighteen of those were Army soldiers, he said.</p>
<p>That's a suicide rate for soldiers in Iraq of about 13.5 per 100,000, Winkenwerder said. In 2002, the Army reported an overall suicide rate of 10.9 per 100,000.</p>
<p>The overall suicide rate nationwide during 2001 was 10.7 per 100,000, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
<p>The military investigates every death and some of those inquiries may be incomplete, meaning the actual suicide rate could be even higher, Winkenwerder said. He said health officials haven't identified any common threads among the confirmed suicides.
<p>The military has nine combat stress teams in Iraq to help treat troops' mental health problems, and each division has a psychiatrist, psychologist and social worker, Winkenwerder said. Of more than 10,000 troops medically evacuated from Iraq, between 300 and 400 were sent outside the country for treatment of mental health problems, he said.
<p>Less than 1 percent of the troops in Iraq are treated for mental issues during an average week, he said.
<p>The military also is working to solve the issue of soldiers awaiting non-emergency medical care. Since November, about 1,900 of 4,400 waiting for medical care have been treated.
