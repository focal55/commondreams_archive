<p>The mother of a South Brunswick man killed in Iraq was arrested yesterday after interrupting a 
speech by first lady Laura Bush during a campaign event in a Hamilton firehouse.<P>
   Sue Niederer wore a shirt with a photo of her son, Army Lt. Seth Dvorin, that read 
"President Bush You Killed My Son." Dvorin died in February, and Niederer said she asked the 
first lady why her daughters and the children of other politicians weren't serving in Iraq.<P>
 "At that point, it became chaotic and I was pushed and shoved," said Niederer, of Hopewell. 
"They engulfed me. It wasn't plain, ordinary folks, but people in suits with earphones."<P>

The crowd chanted "Four more years" as Secret Service agents surrounded Niederer and 
escorted her outside. Once outside, Niederer said she was handcuffed and placed in a police 
van after trying to speak to reporters. She was charged with trespassing.<P>
   "I had a ticket to get in," said Niederer, adding that Hamilton police kept her ticket as 
evidence. "I was in there legitimately."<P>
   Niederer said she obtained a ticket by going to Republican campaign headquarters Tuesday, 
as a local newspaper had advised readers to do. She said some campaign workers recognized her 
as an outspoken anti-war activist, but still gave her a ticket. No one stopped Niederer when 
she checked in by name at yesterday's event.<P>
   Before Niederer's outburst in the firehouse, some people standing near her commented on her 
shirt, expressing sympathy, Niederer said. After her shouted question, Niederer said at least 
one person spoke in her defense, saying, "She has a right to speak. She's a mother."<P>
   A man standing near her noticed the Dvorin shirt and told her his son had served with the 
soldier in Iraq, Niederer said.<P>
   Dvorin graduated in 1998 from South Brunswick High School. He was the son of East Brunswick 
resident Richard Dvorin, Niederer's ex-husband.<P>
   Niederer has an Oct. 12 court date in Hamilton.
