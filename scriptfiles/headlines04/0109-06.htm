<p>WASHINGTON - The year 2003 was the most difficult
for U.S. job hunters since 1983, as they faced the gloomiest
job market in years, according to Labor Department  figures
released on Friday.
<p>
 The unemployment rate was the highest since 1994, and the
search for a new job was the longest in two decades.
<p>
 According to Labor Department data, the average spell of
unemployment lasted 19.2 weeks in 2003, or almost five months.
That was the longest average duration since 1983, when the U.S.
economy was emerging from the worst recession since the
Depression. Then the average spell was 20.0 weeks.
<p>
 As a percentage of all the unemployed, the long-term
jobless -- those out of work for 27 weeks or more -- made up
22.1 percent in 2003, the highest annual number since 23.9
percent in 1983.
<p>
 Democrats have called for renewing a federally-funded
extension of unemployment benefits offered through states to
deal with the problem. They revived their attacks on Friday
after a weaker-than-expected jobs report showed only 1,000 new
hires in December. Measures of long-term joblessness improved
slightly in the month, though.
<p>
 While Bush administration officials have continually
repeated that they will not be satisfied "until every American
who wants a job can get one," it has yet to support a renewal
of extended benefits, a move many economists say would help
blunt the economic damage of the rise in long-term
unemployment.
<p>
 In early December, Treasury Secretary John Snow told
Reuters the administration had yet to decide if it would
support extending the program for a third time.
<p>
 According to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, about 80,000 to 90,000 workers will be
exhausting their state-funded benefits every week by late
January, after the program's eligibility ended in December.
<p>
 "Unemployment is the Achilles' heel of this administration
and Congressional Republicans, and they cannot continue to
ignore it," said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, of
Maryland.
<p>
 Lee Price, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute
and a former Clinton-era Commerce Department  official, said the
long-term jobless numbers show how difficult the labor market
remains.
<p>
 Extending jobless benefits again would stimulate the
economy by putting money in the pockets of people not getting
paychecks, Price said. "Almost 100 percent of that is going to
be spent," he said.</p>
