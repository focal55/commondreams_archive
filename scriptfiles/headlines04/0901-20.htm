<P>SEATTLE -- The burgeoning scandal over claims that a Pentagon 
official passed highly classified secrets to a Zionist lobby group appears 
to be part of a much broader set of FBI and Pentagon investigations of 
close collaboration between prominent U.S. neo-conservatives and Israel 
dating back some 30 years.

					  
<P>
					  
					  
According to knowledgeable sources, who asked to not be identified, the FBI 
(Federal Bureau of Investigation) has been intensively reviewing a series 
of past counter-intelligence probes that were started against several 
high-profile neo-cons but never followed up with prosecutions, to the great 
frustration of counter-intelligence officers, in some cases.
<P>
Some of these past investigations involve top current officials, including 
Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz; Undersecretary of Defence for 
Policy Douglas Feith, whose office appears to be the focus of the most 
recently disclosed inquiry; and Richard Perle, who resigned as Defence 
Policy Board (DPB) chairman last year.
<P>
All three were the subject of a lengthy investigative story by Stephen 
Green published by 'Counterpunch' in February. Green is the author of two 
books on U.S.-Israeli relations, including 'Taking Sides: America's Secret 
Relations with a Militant Israel', which relies heavily on interviews with 
former Pentagon and counter-intelligence officials.
<P>
At the same time, another Pentagon office concerned with the transfer of 
sensitive military and dual-use technologies has been examining the 
acquisition, modification and sales of key hi-tech military equipment by 
Israel obtained from the United States, in some cases with the help of 
prominent neo-conservatives who were then serving in the government.
<P>
Some of that equipment has been sold by Israel -- which in the last 20 
years has become a top exporter of the world's most sophisticated hi-tech 
information and weapons technology -- or by Israeli middlemen, to Russia, 
China and other potential U.S. strategic rivals. Some of it has also found 
its way onto the black market, where terrorist groups -- possibly including 
al-Qaeda -- obtained bootlegged copies, according to these sources.
<P>
Of particular interest in that connection are derivatives of a powerful 
case-management software called PROMIS that was produced by INSLAW, Inc in 
the early 1980s and acquired by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which 
then sold its own versions to other foreign intelligence agencies in the 
Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe.
<P>But these versions were modified with a ”trap door” that permitted the 
seller to spy on the buyers' own intelligence files, according to a number 
of published reports.
<P>

A modified version of the software, which is used to monitor and track 
files on a multitude of databases, is believed to have been acquired by 
al-Qaeda on the black market in the late 1990s, possibly facilitating the 
group's global banking and money-laundering schemes, according to a 
'Washington Times' story of June 2001.
<P>
According to one source, Pentagon investigators believe it possible that 
al-Qaeda used the software to spy on various U.S. agencies that could have 
detected or foiled the Sep. 11, 2001 attack.
<P>
The FBI is reportedly also involved in the Pentagon's investigation, which 
is overseen by Deputy Undersecretary of Defence for International 
Technology Security John A ”Jack” Shaw with the explicit support of Defence 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
<P>
The latest incident is based on allegations that a Defence Intelligence 
Agency (DIA) career officer, Larry Franklin -- who was assigned in 2001 to 
work in a special office dealing with Iraq and Iran under Feith -- provided 
highly classified information, including a draft on U.S. policy towards 
Iran, to two staff members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee 
(AIPAC), one of Washington's most powerful lobby groups. One or both of the 
recipients allegedly passed the material to the Israeli embassy.
<P>
Franklin has not commented on the allegation, and Israel and AIPAC have 
strongly denied any involvement and say they are co-operating fully with 
FBI investigators.
<P>
The office in which Franklin has worked since 2001 is dominated by staunch 
neo-conservatives, including Feith himself. Headed by William Luti, a 
retired Navy officer who worked for DPB member Newt Gingrich when he was 
speaker of the House of Representatives, it played a central role in 
building the case for war in Iraq.
<P>
Part of the office's strategy included working closely with the Iraqi 
National Congress (INC) led by now-disgraced exile Ahmad Chalabi, and the 
DPB members in developing and selectively leaking intelligence analyses 
that supported the now-discredited thesis that former Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein had close ties to al-Qaeda.
<P>
Feith's office enjoyed especially close links with Vice President Dick 
Cheney's chief of staff, I Lewis Libby, to whom it ”stovepiped” its 
analyses without having them vetted by professional intelligence analysts 
in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the DIA, or the State Department 
Bureau for Intelligence of Research (INR).
<P>
Since the Iraq war, Feith's office has also lobbied hard within the U.S. 
government for a confrontational posture vis-à-vis Iran and Syria, 
including actions aimed at destabilising both governments -- policies 
which, in addition to the ousting of Hussein, have been strongly and 
publicly urged by prominent, hard-line neo-conservatives, such as Perle, 
Feith and Perle's associate at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), 
Michael Ledeen, among others.
<P>
Despite his status as a career officer, Franklin, who is an Iran 
specialist, is considered both personally and ideologically close to 
several other prominent neo-conservatives, who have also acted in various 
consultancy roles at the Pentagon, including Ledeen and Harold Rhode, who 
once described himself as Deputy Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz's chief 
adviser on Islam.
<P>
In December 2001, Rhode and Franklin met in Europe with a shadowy Iranian 
arms dealer, Manichur Ghorbanifar, who, along with Ledeen, played a central 
role in the arms-for-hostages deal involving the Reagan administration, 
Israel and Iran in the mid-1980s that became known as the ”Iran-Contra 
Affair.”
<P>
Ledeen set up the more recent meetings that apparently triggered the FBI to 
launch its investigation, which has intensified in recent months amid 
reports that Chalabi's INC, which has long been championed by the 
neo-conservatives, has been passing sensitive intelligence to Iran.
<P>
Feith has long been an outspoken supporter of Israel's Likud Party, and his 
former law partner Marc Zell has served as a spokesman in Israel for the 
Jewish settler movement on the occupied West Bank.
<P>
He, Perle and several other like-minded hardliners participated in a task 
force that called for then-Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to 
work for the installation of a friendly government in Baghdad as a means of 
permanently altering the balance of power in the Middle East in Israel's 
favour, permitting it to abandon the Oslo peace process, which Feith had 
publicly opposed.
<P>
Previously, Feith served as a Middle East analyst in the National Security 
Council in the administration of former President Ronald Reagan (1981-89), 
but was summarily removed from that position in March 1982 because he had 
been the object of a FBI inquiry into whether he had provided classified 
material to an official of the Israeli embassy in Washington, according to 
Green's account.
<P>
But Perle, who was then serving as assistant secretary of defence for 
international security policy (ISP), which, among other responsibilities, 
had an important say in approving or denying licenses to export sensitive 
military or dual-use technology abroad, hired him as his ”special counsel” 
and later as his deputy, where he served until 1986, when he left for his 
law practice with Zell, who had by then moved to Israel.
<P>
Also serving under Perle during these years was Stephen Bryen, a former 
staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the subject of a 
major FBI investigation in the late 1970s for offering classified documents 
to an Israeli intelligence officer in the presence of AIPAC's director, 
according to Green's account, which is backed up by some 500 pages of 
investigation documents released under a Freedom of Information request 
some 15 years ago.
<P>
Although political appointees decided against prosecution, Bryen was 
reportedly asked to leave the committee and, until his appointment by Perle 
in 1981, served as head of the Jewish Institute for National Security 
Affairs (JINSA), a group dedicated to promoting strategic ties between the 
United States and Israel and one in which Perle, Feith and Ledeen have long 
been active.
<P>
In his position as Perle's deputy, Bryen created the Defence Technology 
Security Administration (DTSA) which enforced regulations regarding 
technology transfer to foreign countries.
<P>
During his tenure, according to one source with personal knowledge of 
Bryen's work, ”the U.S. shut down transfers to western Europe and Japan 
(which were depicted as too ready to sell them to Moscow) and opened up a 
back door to Israel” -- a pattern that became embarrassingly evident after 
Perle left office and the current deputy secretary of state, Richard 
Armitage, took over in 1987.
<P>
Soon, Armitage was raising serious questions about Bryen's approval of 
sensitive exports to Israel without appropriate vetting by other agencies.
<P>”It is in the interest of U.S. and Israel to remove needless impediments to 
technological cooperation between them,” Feith wrote in 'Commentary' in 
1992. ”Technologies in the hands of responsible, friendly countries facing 
military threats, countries like Israel, serve to deter aggression, enhance 
regional stability and promote peace thereby.”
<P>
Perle, Ledeen, and Wolfowitz have also been the subject of FBI inquiries, 
according to Green's account. In 1970, one year after he was hired by 
Senator Henry ”Scoop” Jackson, an FBI wiretap authorised for the Israeli 
Embassy picked up Perle discussing classified information with an embassy 
official, while Wolfowitz was investigated in 1978 for providing a 
classified document on the proposed sale of a U.S. weapons system to an 
Arab government to an Israeli official via an AIPAC staffer.
<P>
In 1992, when he was serving as undersecretary of defence for policy, 
Pentagon officials looking into the unauthorised export of classified 
technology to China, found that Wolfowitz's office was promoting Israel's 
export of advanced air-to-air missiles to Beijing in violation of a written 
agreement with Washington on arms re-sales.
<P>
The FBI and the Pentagon are reportedly taking a new look at all of these 
incidents and others to, in the words of a 'New York Times' story Sunday, 
”get a better understanding of the relationships among conservative 
officials with strong ties to Israel.”
<P>
It would be a mistake to see Franklin as the chief target of the current 
investigation, according to sources, but rather he should be viewed as one 
piece of a much broader puzzle.<p align="center">&copy; 2004  Inter Press Service</p>
