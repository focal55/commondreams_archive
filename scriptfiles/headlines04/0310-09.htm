<p> SOUTH KINGSTOWN -- Bob Tingle was incensed to learn how his daughter 
      Kimberly had spent last Tuesday at school. She and more than 200 other 
      South Kingstown High School students had attended a lecture by historian 
      and anti-war protester Howard Zinn.
    </p>
<p>
      The author and activist told the students of his objections to American 
      foreign policy and to President Bush.
    </p>
<p>
      Last night it was Tingle who took a stand before the School Committee. 
      He described Zinn's message as &quot;poisonous venom.&quot; He demanded to know 
      who authorized the controversial speaker; which students had been 
      invited to the lecture; and why parents had not been required to sign 
      permission slips.
    </p>
<p>
      &quot;My daughter missed three periods to hear this garbage,&quot; Tingle said. 
      &quot;This has crossed the line; this is way over the line.&quot;
    </p>
<p>
      He read excerpts from articles by Zinn calling Iraq an occupied state 
      and drawing a parallel between America and Nazi Germany.
    </p>
<p>
      A professor emeritus of political science at Boston University, Zinn is 
      best known for his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060528370/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new"><i>A People's History of the United States</i></a>, which 
      presents American history through social movements.
    </p>
<p>
      Tingle asked for an apology from whoever authorized Zinn's speech and 
      that future lectures be more &quot;mainstream.&quot; The person responsible should 
      be fired, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The School Committee did not respond to Tingle's questioning, as per its 
      policy during the public comment period. But Supt. Robert Hicks 
      explained earlier in the meeting that a student had approached Zinn, 
      whose talk was in keeping with issues upper-level students were 
      analyzing in class. A stimulating point-counterpoint exchange followed 
      the lecture, he said, adding that the school has a policy of academic 
      freedom.
    </p>
<p>
      Tingle's comments drew supporters, and objectors.
    </p>
<p>
      &quot;If [Zinn] doesn't like the way this country's run, he shouldn't be 
      here,&quot; said Stephanie Accaputo, who has three young children in the 
      school system.
    </p>
<p>
      She suggested that a conservative speaker be invited to address students.
    </p>
<p>
      But, she said: &quot;Political ideas shouldn't be discussed in high school.&quot;
    </p>
<p>
      Sophomore Simon Riley explained that the students who attended Zinn's 
      lecture were selected &quot;based on intellectual ability.&quot; They are capable 
      of taking various political opinions &quot;with a grain of salt.&quot;
    </p>
<p>
      He welcomed the prospect of a conservative lecturer. &quot;I think the more 
      conversation there is, the better.&quot;
    </p>
<p>
      Andy Tran, also a sophomore, agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      &quot;I would just like to say opinions shouldn't be extinguished.&quot;
    </p>
