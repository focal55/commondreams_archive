<p>BAGHDAD --
Looters stormed the weapons site at Al Qaqaa in the days after 
American troops swept through the area in early April 2003 on their way to 
Baghdad, gutting office buildings, carrying off munitions and even dismantling 
heavy machinery, three Iraqi witnesses and a regional security chief said 
Wednesday.
<P>The Iraqis described an orgy of theft so extensive that enterprising 
residents rented their trucks to looters. But some looting was clearly 
indiscriminate, with people grabbing anything they could find and later 
heaving unwanted items off the trucks.
<P>Two witnesses were employees of Al Qaqaa  --  one a chemical engineer and 
the other a mechanic  --  and the third was a former employee, a chemist, who 
had come back to retrieve his records, determined to keep them out of U.S. 
hands. The mechanic, Ahmed Saleh Mezher, said employees asked the Americans to 
protect the site, but were told this was not the soldiers' responsibility.
<P>The accounts do not directly address the question of when nearly 400 tons 
of powerful conventional explosives vanished from the site sometime after 
early March, the last time international inspectors checked the seals on the 
bunkers where the material was stored. It is possible that Iraqi forces 
removed some explosives before the invasion.
<P>But the accounts make clear that what set off much if not all of the 
looting was the arrival and swift departure of U.S. troops, who did not secure 
the site after inducing the Iraqi forces to abandon it.
<P>"The looting started after the collapse of the regime," said Wathiq al-
Dulaimi, a regional security chief, who was based nearby in Latifiya. But once 
it had begun, he said, the booty streamed toward Baghdad.
<P>On Oct. 10, the directorate of national monitoring at the Ministry of 
Science and Technology notified the International Atomic Energy Agency that 
the explosives  --  which are used in demolition and missiles and are the raw 
material for plastic explosives  --  were missing. The agency has monitored 
the explosives because they also can be used as the initiator of an atomic 
bomb.

<P>Agency officials examined the explosives in January 2003 and noted in 
early March that their seals were still in place. On April 3, the 3rd Infantry 
Division arrived with the first U.S. troops. 
<P>Chris Anderson, a photographer for U.S. News and World Report who was 
with the division's 2nd Brigade, recalled that the area was jammed with U.S. 
armor on April 3 and 4, which he believed made the removal of the explosives 
unlikely. "It would be quite improbable for this amount of weapons to be 
looted at that time because of the traffic jam of armor," he said.
<P>The brigade blew up numerous caches of arms throughout the area, he said. 
Anderson said he did not enter the munitions compound.
<P>Pentagon officials said Wednesday that analysts were examining 
surveillance photographs of the munitions site. But they expressed doubts that 
the photographs would be able to show conclusively when the explosives were 
removed.
<P>Col. David Perkins, who commanded the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry 
Division, called it "very highly improbable" that the explosives could have 
been trucked out of Al Qaqaa in the weeks after U.S. troops arrived.
<P>He conceded that some looting of the site had taken place. But a chemical 
engineer who worked at Al Qaqaa and identified himself only as Khalid said 
that once troops left the base itself, people streamed in to steal computers 
and anything else of value from the offices. They also took munitions like 
artillery shells, he said.
<P>Mezher, the mechanic, said it took the looters about two weeks to 
disassemble heavy machinery at the site and carry that off after the smaller 
items were gone.
