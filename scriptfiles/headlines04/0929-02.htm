<p>WASHINGTON   - Angered by President Bush's policy  in Iraq, a group of military families whose relatives died  there is targeting the president in new television ads to be  aired ahead of the Nov. 2 election.<p> 
			
			"I think the American people need to know that we have been  betrayed in this rush to war," said Cindy Sheehan, whose son  Casey is among the more than 1,000 U.S. troops who died in the  war.<p>

Sheehan is joining a small group of military families in  Washington on Wednesday to launch new political ads by an  interest group called <a href="http://www.RealVoices.org" target="_new">RealVoices.org</a>, which supports  Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's bid for the White House.
<p> 
			
"It's important that we get our troops home from Iraq as  soon as possible so no other families have to go through what  we are going through," said Sheehan of Vacaville, California.<p> 
			
			The ads are expected to be aired nationally in the coming  weeks and in battleground cities of Las Vegas, Orlando and  Albuquerque.<p> 
			
			In one ad, Sheehan is seen sobbing as she tells the story  of her son, 24-year-old Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, who died in  the arms of one of his friends in Iraq on April 4, 2004.<p> 
			
			Al Zappala is active in "Military Families Speak Out"  (<a href="http://www.mfso.org" target="_new">www.mfso.org</a>), a group that opposes the U.S. war in Iraq and  has about 1,700 families among its members. He is in Washington  for the ads and to attend a peace march on Saturday.
<p> 
			
Zappala's son, Sgt. Sherwood Baker, was killed on April 26  in Iraq and was the first Pennsylvania National Guard soldier  to die in action since World War II.<p> 
			
			"I feel so let down by the Bush administration," said  Zappala, who said Military Families Speak Out was a  non-partisan group.<p> 
			
			OPPOSING VIEWS<p> 
			
			Another group, "Military Moms with a Mission," is  campaigning in 30 cities across America to tell people why they  should vote for Kerry.<p> 
			
			"They are traveling the country telling people their  stories and why George Bush has let them down. Many are  frustrated that George Bush is not telling the truth about the  reality in Iraq," said Kerry campaign spokesman Chad Clanton.<p> 
			
			Countering this campaign to support Kerry are similar  groups who back Bush and his policy in Iraq.<p> 
			
			Retired Air Force Capt. Linda Bergin is campaigning on  behalf of military families and others in New Jersey and says  Bush is the only leader capable of leading America following  the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.<p> 
			
			She said many veterans and people still in the military  felt Kerry had been disloyal, particularly after he returned  home from Vietnam and criticized the U.S. presence there.<p> 
			
			"People are heartbroken their people are over there but out  of respect of their child, they want to support the president,"  she said.<p> 
			
			Nancy Kennon, founder of the group "Security Moms For  Bush," said many military families had contacted her Web site  (www.moms4Bush.com) to lend their support and were sick of the  negative message pushed by the Kerry campaign.<p> 
			
			"I have got some letters from active military moms and they  have been saddened by the negative spin," said Kennon, who  lives in Westchester, New York. She is the mother of young twin  daughters and does not have a child in the military.<p> 
			
			The Bush campaign could not immediately be reached for  comment on the new ads.</p>
