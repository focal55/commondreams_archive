<p>BAGHDAD - If Iraqis ever see Saddam Hussein on  trial, they want his former American allies shackled beside  him.<p> 
			
							"Saddam should not be the only one who is put on trial. The  Americans backed him when he was killing Iraqis so they should  be prosecuted," said Ali Mahdi, a builder.<p> 
			
							"If the Americans escape justice they will face God's  justice. They must be stoned in hell."<p>

      IRAQIS WANT SADDAM'S OLD US FRIENDS ON TRIAL<br>
      An Iraqi man shouts at a demonstration by protesters demanding that the status of toppled leader Saddam Hussein be changed to that of a war criminal, allowing his execution, in central Baghdad January 20, 2004. The United States formally declared Saddam Hussein a prisoner of war, entitling him to a host of rights spelt out by the Geneva Convention. REUTERS/Oleg Popov <br>

  <!--/endimage/-->The United States continued to feel the backlash of its  move to give Saddam prisoner of war status Tuesday as thousands  of Iraqi protesters called for his execution.<p> 
			
							Washington's move has thrown some doubt over his fate after  Iraq's U.S.-backed Governing Council had said Saddam would be  tried in a special tribunal by Iraqi judges.<p> 
			
							His POW status means the former dictator, accused of  sending thousands of Iraqis to mass graves, could have more  rights than a war criminal.<p> 
			
							In street interviews, Iraqis said Saddam must be tried by  an Iraqi court prepared to hand down the death penalty and  examine his ties to past U.S. governments.<p> 
			
							The United States backed Saddam in his war with Iran in the  1980s. During that time, he also gassed an estimated 5,000  Kurds to death in the village of Halabja.<p> 
			
							A few years later Washington began branding Saddam a tyrant  and an enemy after his troops invaded oil-rich Kuwait in 1990.<p> 
			
							"Saddam was a top graduate of the American school of  politics," said Assad al-Saadi, standing with friends in the  slum of Sadr city, formerly called Saddam City, a Shi'ite  Muslim area oppressed by Saddam's security agents.<p> 
			
							"My brother was an army officer who was executed. Saddam is  a criminal and the Americans were his friends. We need justice  so that we can forget the past."<p> 
			
							Saddam was captured on December 13 hiding in a hole near  his hometown of Tikrit. A month later the United States  declared him a prisoner of war.<p> 
			
							But his new POW status has only added to skepticism about  American promises after toppling Saddam in April.<p> 
			
							"The Americans and Saddam should face justice. Do you  really think the Americans are going to put themselves on  trial?" said Ali, a U.S.-trained policeman.<p> 
			
							"Of course we hope the Americans and Saddam will face  trial. But will it ever happen? I doubt it."
