<p>WASHINGTON   - Remarks by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, indicating a belief that al-Qaida operatives would prefer John Kerry in the White House, sparked a firestorm of protest Sunday from Democrats who labeled the Illinois Republican's comments as "fear mongering" and "un-American."

<p>But a Hastert spokesman said Democrats should first work with Kerry to try to reconcile what he called "inconsistent" positions on Iraq and homeland security. And Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican National Committee, contended that a Kerry administration's strategy on Iraq amounted to little more than "retreat and defeat."

<p>The heightened rhetoric on terrorism and Iraq underscored the importance of those issues, as well as a concerted effort by Kerry to weaken Bush's leadership standing as shown in public opinion polls.

<p>Kerry aides have indicated that the Democratic campaign will ratchet up its attacks on Bush next week, contending the Republican incumbent is painting a too-positive picture of Iraq to cover faulty intelligence used to justify the invasion, and that the president failed to adequately plan for Iraqi insurgents.

<p>The Bush campaign has responded by noting that Kerry, who voted to authorize troops in Iraq, has said he would still cast such a vote. At the same time, Kerry also has said he did not think going to war was justified given current circumstances.

<p>Campaigning in Phoenixville, Pa., near Philadelphia, Kerry running mate John Edwards blasted remarks by Hastert, R-Ill., made before and during a Saturday fund-raising event at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb that featured Vice President Dick Cheney.

<p>Hastert warned al-Qaida would seek to influence the Nov. 2 election and said it would prefer "somebody who would file a lawsuit with the World Court or something rather than respond with troops." Asked by reporters if al-Qaida terrorists could operate better with Kerry elected president, Hastert replied, "That's my opinion, yes."

<p>Edwards, a senator from North Carolina, on Sunday accused Hastert of joining "the fear-mongering choir" of Republicans attempting to portray Kerry as weak in combating the nation's terrorist threat.

<p>"Let me say this in the simplest possible terms: when John Kerry is President of the United States, we will find al-Qaida where they are and crush them before they can do damage to the American people," Edwards said in a statement.

<p>Noting that Cheney had earlier this month indicated that the nation faced a greater threat of a domestic terrorist attack under Kerry, Edwards said, "Over and over, this president and his cronies have taken one of our nation's greatest tragedies and used it as part of a cheap political ploy."

<p>Cheney, who said terrorists would strike the nation again "if we make the wrong choice" in the election, later explained that his comment was meant to convey the belief that whoever is elected president faces a serious threat of terrorism at home.

<p>Edwards, however, said Cheney's language was "not an accident" and said the vice president's rhetoric was "un-American." An aide to Edwards said that phrase applied to Hastert's comments as well.

<p>Terry McAuliffe, the head of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN's "Late Edition" that Hastert's remarks were part of a series of "outrageous statements, once again trying to scare Americans."

<p>Hastert spokesman John McGovern did not directly address the Democratic attacks, but instead echoed Republican criticism that Kerry has voiced various positions on Iraq.

<p>"Instead of attacking Republicans, John Edwards and other Democrats should help John Kerry explain to the American people his inconsistent and contradictory positions on national security, intelligence and other defense issues," McGovern said.

<p>Also appearing on the CNN program, Gillespie, chided Kerry and Democrats for sharply criticizing Bush on Iraq.

<p>"We're going to have victory in Iraq," Gillespie said. "That is critically important for our national security interests, that we not engage in a policy of retreat and defeat, which is what you increasingly hear out of the Kerry camp."
