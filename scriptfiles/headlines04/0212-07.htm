<p>VIENNA - The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog
said on Thursday the world could be headed for destruction if
it does not stop the spread of atomic weapons technology, which
has become widely accessible.
<p>In an opinion piece in the New York Times, Mohamed
ElBaradei wrote that nuclear technology, once virtually
unobtainable, is now obtainable through "a sophisticated
worldwide network able to deliver systems for producing
material usable in weapons."
<p>Above all ElBaradei echoed President Bush's call in a
speech on Wednesday for states to tighten up the control of
their companies' nuclear exports to proliferators.
<p>
ElBaradei, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
director-general, said the world must act quickly because
inaction would a create a proliferation disaster.
<p>
 "The supply network will grow, making it easier to acquire
nuclear weapon expertise and materials. Eventually, inevitably,
terrorists will gain access to such materials and technology,
if not actual weapons," he wrote.
<p>
 "If the world does not change course, we risk
self-destruction," ElBaradei said.
<p>
 The father of Pakistan's atom bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan,
admitted last week that he and scientists from his Khan
Research Laboratory in Pakistan leaked nuclear secrets.
<p>
 They are believed to have been part of a global nuclear
black market organized to help countries under embargo such as
Iran, North Korea  and Libya skirt international sanctions and
obtain nuclear technology that could be used to make weapons.
<p>
 The massive illicit network has touched on at least 15
countries around the world.
<p>
 ElBaradei said the 1968 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), the global pact aimed at stopping the spread of atomic
weapons, needed to be revisited and toughened to bring it in
line with the demands of the 21st century.
<p>
 He said it should not be possible to withdraw from the NPT,
as North Korea did last year, while the tougher inspections in
the NPT Additional Protocol should be mandatory in all
countries. Currently fewer than 40 of the more than 180 NPT
signatories have approved the protocol.
<p>
 NUCLEAR EXPORT CONTROLS
<p>
 ElBaradei said that the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a
40-nation group of countries that work together to prevent the
export of peaceful nuclear technology to countries that might
want weapons, needed to be transformed into a binding treaty.
<p>
 "The current system relies on a gentlemen's agreement that
is not only non-binding, but also limited in its membership: it
does not include many countries with growing industrial
capacity," he wrote.
<p>
 "And even some members fail to control the exports of
companies unaffiliated with government enterprise," he added.
<p>
 ElBaradei called for the production of fissile material for
weapons to be halted and enrichment technology restricted.
<p>
 He said people who assist proliferators should be treated
as criminals and states should eradicate loopholes that enable
sensitive exports to slip past regulators.
<p>
 He also called on the atomic weapons states who signed the
NPT -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France --
to move toward disarmament as called for in the pact.
<p>
In a clear jab at the United States, which plans to forge
ahead with research into the so-called mini nukes, ElBaradei
said the world must drop the idea that nuclear weapons are fine
in the hands of some countries and bad in the hands of others.
<p>
"We must abandon the unworkable notion that it is morally
reprehensible for some countries to pursue weapons of mass
destruction yet morally acceptable for others to rely on them
for security -- and indeed to continue to refine their
capacities and postulate plans for their use," he said.</p>
