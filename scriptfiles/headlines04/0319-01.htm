Arab journalists walked out of a news conference held by Powell in a protest against the shooting deaths of two Iraqi reporters, allegedly by U.S. troops. A reporter for Arab satellite television station Al-Arabiya died from his wounds Friday after U.S. soldiers shot him hours earlier along with a cameraman, who died at the scene, the station said. The death brought to five the number of journalists killed in Iraq in less than 24 hours. (AP Photo/Murad Sezer) <br>

Powell urged U.S. allies to stay the course in Iraq after  Spain vowed to pull out troops and South Korea refused to take  on a combat role.<p> 
			
			"This is not the time to say 'let's stop what we are doing  and pull back'," he told the news conference.<p> 
			
			"This is the time to...deal with this threat to the  civilized world and not run and hide and think that it won't  come and get us -- it will."<p> 
			
			About 30 Iraqi journalists quit the hall in anger at  Thursday's shooting of two colleagues who worked for the  Dubai-based satellite television channel Al Arabiya.<p> 
			
			"We declare our condemnation of the incident which led to  the killing of the two journalists...at the hands of the  American forces," declared Najim al-Rubaie of Iraq's Distor  daily as Powell and Iraq's U.S. governor Paul Bremer looked on.<p> 
			
			Al Arabiya employees say U.S. soldiers fired on a car  carrying an Arabiya crew on Thursday evening after another car  ran through a checkpoint. Cameraman Ali Abdelaziz was killed  and correspondent Ali al-Khatib died in hospital on Friday  morning.<p> 
			
			"HORRIBLE DICTATORSHIP"<p> 
			
			After the walkout, Powell said he respected the right of  the journalists to express their feelings, adding they could  not have done so under Iraq's former Baathist government.<p> 
			
			He said he regretted the deaths of the journalists, but was  sure troops would not have killed them on purpose.<p> 
			
			Powell, on a surprise visit to Baghdad, hailed the war in  Iraq after a year of bloodshed, saying it had rid the country  of a "horrible dictatorial regime."<p> 
			
			Earlier he told hundreds of U.S. soldiers and civilians,  now frequent targets for attack, that Iraq and its neighbors  need no longer fear Saddam Hussein's chemical arsenal -- even  though U.S. experts have found no such weapons in a year-long  hunt.<p> 
			
			"We don't have to worry about that any more on this March  day, this one year commemoration of the beginning of the war,"  declared Powell, who flew in from Kuwait and later left.<p> 
			
			Across town, about 7,000 Sunnis and Shi'ites marched  against the occupation after Friday prayers in two main  mosques. "No to America, no to Saddam," they chanted in a show  of unity.<p> 
			
			The U.S. military has lost 392 troops in action since the  United States and Britain launched the war to rid Iraq of the  so far elusive banned weapons they said Saddam possessed.<p>

Powell said "difficult days" lay ahead for Iraq, where at  least 10 people were killed in the latest violence on Thursday.<p> 
			
			"We have to shift as the enemy shifts. They have moved from  harder targets to softer targets. We'll have to adapt our  tactics likewise," he said, adding that Iraqi forces would take  on an increasing role in fighting the insurgency.<p> 
			
			A London-based Arabic newspaper said al Qaeda had claimed  responsibility for a Baghdad hotel attack on Wednesday that  killed at least seven civilians.<p> 
			
			The postwar violence, coupled with last week's devastating  bombings in Madrid, has jangled the nerves of several U.S.  allies providing military support in Iraq.<p> 
			
			WAVERING ALLIES<p> 
			
			Powell, seeking to stiffen their spines, said the  engagement in Iraq was part of the struggle against global  terrorism.<p> 
			
			South Korea said on Friday it had refused a U.S. request  for help in offensive operations and would not deploy troops in  the northern city of Kirkuk because of deteriorating security  there.<p> 
			
			The unexpected decision seemed sure to delay the planned  April deployment of more than 3,000 South Korean troops to  augment 600 already in Iraq helping with reconstruction.<p> 
			
			Spain's new leader pledged last week to pull troops out of  Iraq after an election upset that followed the train bombings  which killed 202 people in Madrid. A videotape purportedly from  al Qaeda said the attack was to punish Spain for its Iraq role.<p> 
			
			A senior coalition military official praised the work  Spanish troops had done but said their withdrawal would be  militarily "manageable."<p> 
			
			He voiced confidence that other nations in the coalition  would stay. "We're not going to see some sort of domino effect  with the Spaniards."<p> 
			
			Poland, another key U.S. ally in Iraq, vowed not to  withdraw troops from the country.<p> 
			
			Powell acknowledged there was no agreement yet on the shape  of a sovereign government due to assume power on July 1, saying  he hoped a U.N. envoy would arrive soon to join talks about  various options with the U.S.-backed Iraqi Governing Council.<p> 
			
			U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Thursday he would  send a U.N. political team to Iraq soon to advise on a  transitional government and elections early next year.  (Additional reporting by Suleiman al-Khalidi and Luke Baker)
