<p>LONDON - More than a million women have died because rich 
nations have failed to honor their commitments to promote sexual and 
reproductive health, a group of NGOs said at the launch of a new campaign 
in London Thursday.
</b> 
<p>
                  
About three-quarters of a million pregnant women and newly delivered 
mothers in the developing world died over the five-year period between 
1996 and 2001, the groups say.
<p>
But the total number will be considerably more in the ten years now since 
the developed countries made their commitment at the United Nations 
International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 
1994, say the non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
<p>
The NGOs have come together in a campaign '<a href="http://www.countdown2015.org" target="_new">Countdown 2015</a>' to call on 
governments to now meet their commitments. A delegation from sexual and 
reproductive health agencies including <a href="http://www.mariestopes.org.uk" target="_new">Marie Stopes International</a> and 
<a href="http://www.interactworldwide.org" target="_new">Interact Worldwide</a> presented a petition to the office of the British 
Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street.
<p>
Simultaneous petitions were presented to governments Thursday by groups 
in Italy, Denmark and Germany. U.S. groups plan to hand over a petition 
to their government next week.
<p>
An analysis of government budgets by the U.S. based <a href="http://www.populationaction.org/" target="_new">Population Action 
International</a> shows that developed countries had made a commitment of 30 
billion dollars for the period 1996-2001 over which the budgets were 
examined. The amount paid was a little more than 10 billion dollars, 
leaving a shortfall of almost 20 billion dollars.
<p>
The Countdown 2015 NGOs figure the money that fell short could have 
prevented 268 million unwanted pregnancies, 113 million induced 
abortions, 7.2 million infant deaths and 733,000 pregnancy related deaths.
<p>
”The missing money has meant clinics without pills, without condoms, or 
even without such things as gloves and gauzes,” chief executive of 
Interact Ros Davies told IPS. ”We would have been in a far better 
situation if the governments had kept their commitments.”
<p>
One reason for the failure to keep commitments has been the generally 
declining levels of official development assistance, Davies said. ”Also, 
a lot of the NGOs involved in this field are service providers, and 
therefore not very good at political lobbying and advocacy.” But the time 
has come now for them to advocate the cause and push the case 
politically, she said.
<p>
U.S. policies have presented a particular problem. Under U.S. law passed 
by the Bush administration within the first week of President George W. 
Bush taking over, U.S. funding is denied to any agency that provides 
abortions, or engages in abortion counseling or referrals.
<p>
”The funding is denied even to groups for activities like fighting HIV 
and AIDS if another part of the group engages in abortion services,” 
Julia Ekong from Marie Stopes International told IPS. 
<p>
The groups campaigning for more spending on reproductive health say the 
United States in effect achieved the opposite of what it had professed 
to, because it meant many more women resorting to illegal and unsafe 
abortions.
<p>
The U.S. government that was due to spend 12. 3 billion dollars for 
sexual and reproductive health aid ended up spending about 4.1 billion 
dollars during the five-year period studied.
<p>
That still meant that the United States paid 30 percent of its due, 
percentage-wise a good deal more than France which paid no more than 
three percent of what it was committed to for the period. Several 
European countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal have made similarly 
tiny contributions.
<p>
Other countries that fell short of their commitments include Australia, 
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, 
Portugal, Britain and Switzerland. 
<p>
Among these, Britain comes closest to meeting the target after paying 88 
percent of its commitment of 2.3 billion dollars, according to figures 
released by the Department for International Development in Britain.
<p>
The only countries that have paid their share in full are Denmark, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. 
<p>
Money on reproductive health is money well spent, said Davies. ”Every 
dollar spent on reproductive health saves 16 dollars later on curative 
treatments on average.” 
<p>
The 30 billion dollars committed is only a third of the total requirement 
estimated at the Cairo conference. The rest was to come from developing 
countries, which have produced a far greater share of their commitments 
than the developed countries. Much of the spending within developing 
countries has come from end users.
<p>
Increased spending on reproductive health is necessary immediately to 
meet the millennium development goal of sexual and reproductive rights 
for all by 2015, the NGOs say.
