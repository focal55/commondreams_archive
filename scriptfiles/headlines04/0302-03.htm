<p>BAGHDAD/KERBALA, Iraq  - At least 143 people died  in a wave of coordinated attacks on millions of Shi'ite  worshippers in Baghdad and Kerbala Tuesday in the bloodiest day  in Iraq since Saddam Hussein's fall.
<p> 
			
The U.S. military said three suicide bombers killed 58  people in Baghdad around the Kadhimiya mosque, and a suicide  bomber and mortars combined to kill at least 85 in Kerbala, a  Shi'ite holy city 68 miles south of Baghdad.<p>

The near-simultaneous attacks devastated an annual ritual  -- banned under the Sunni Saddam -- during which Shi'ites beat  their heads and chests and gash their heads with swords to  honor a revered figure killed in battle 1,324 years ago.<p> 
			
			In Kerbala, where two million worshippers had gathered,  rescuers raced through the streets with bodies laden two or  three high onto wooden vegetable carts, desperately searching  for a doctor or an ambulance.<p> 
			
			Shi'ites who earlier had gashed open their heads with  swords queued up to give blood to the wounded.<p> 
			
			Many corpses were missing body parts. A man's scalp and ear  lay alongside rotting fruit and a muddied pool of water.<p> 
			
			No one claimed responsibility for the attacks. Leaders of  Iraq's 60 percent Shi'ite majority accused the attackers of  trying to ignite civil war.<p> 
			
			Several members of Iraq's U.S.-appointed Governing Council  blamed the attacks on Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian whom  Washington suspects of working for al Qaeda inside Iraq.<p> 
			
			In a separate attack in Baghdad, guerrillas threw a bomb at  a U.S. military vehicle, killing one American soldier and  seriously wounding another, the army said. The death took to  379 the number of U.S. soldiers killed in action since the  start of the U.S.-led war in Iraq nearly a year ago.<p> 
			
			It was the deadliest day since Saddam fell last April 9.<p> 
			
			In the bloodiest previous attack, on Feb. 1, two suicide  bombers walked into the offices of the two main Kurdish parties  in Arbil, northern Iraq, and blew themselves up, killing at  least 101 people.<p> 
			
			Shi'ites also were targeted in southwestern Pakistan where  at least 37 people were killed and more than 150 wounded on  Tuesday in an attack by suspected Sunni Muslim radicals,  hospital sources said.<p> 
			
			WHO TO BLAME?<p> 
			
			Unsure who to blame, survivors in Baghdad hurled stones at  U.S. troops who arrived on the scene.<p> 
			
			In Kerbala, enraged Shi'ites turned on Iranian pilgrims  after the blasts -- even though an Iranian Interior Ministry  official said 40 to 50 Iranians were among the dead and wounded  in the attacks on the two cities.<p> 
			
			U.S. forces in Iraq said last month they had intercepted a  computer disc with a letter from Zarqawi urging suicide bomb  attacks on Shi'ites to inflame sectarian tension in Iraq.<p> 
			
			"The civil war and sectarian strife that Zarqawi wants to  inflict on the people of Iraq will not succeed. Zarqawi failed,  his gang and their evil plans have failed," Mowaffaq al-Rubaie,  a Shi'ite Governing Council member, told a news conference.<p> 
			
			"Sunnis, Shi'ites, Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, all Iraqis are  determined to move forward," he said. "United we stand and we  go forward to build a new Iraq."<p> 
			
			The U.S. military said in a statement that "those  initiating these attacks are cowards and terrorists." Officers  said they had no information on who was behind the attacks.<p> 
			
			"The people behind this act are what remains of the regime,  backed by people like al Qaeda with the goal of igniting civil  strife, but we and the rest of the Iraqi people are aware of  this danger and will not succumb to it," said Hamid al-Bayati,  a senior official in the Shi'ite Supreme Council for the  Islamic Revolution in Iraq.<p> 
			
			Monday, the competing religious and ethnic groups in the  Governing Council forged an interim constitution, putting aside  differences over the role of Islam, representation for women  and Kurdish demands for autonomy.

The Shi'ite ceremonies Tuesday mark Ashura, which according to tradition commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, Prophet Mohammad's grandson.<p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2004 Reuters Ltd</p>
