<p>WASHINGTON  - The Pentagon failed to meet its goal  of declaring a missile defense system operational in 2004 and  critics said failures in testing the ambitious system show it  simply does not work.

<!--/endimage/-->The latest test of the multibillion-dollar system ended in  failure on Dec. 15 when one of the interceptors intended to  destroy an incoming enemy ballistic missile failed to launch on  cue from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.<p> 
			
			Four of the system's nine major tests have been failures,  and the five successes have been achieved under tightly  controlled conditions.<p> 
			
			Meanwhile, key components are absent, including a  high-resolution, high-power, sea-based radar and two big  satellite constellations.<p> 
			
			President Bush said two years ago he wanted the system up  and running by September 2004. The Pentagon's Missile Defense  Agency later said the intention was to make it operational by  the end of 2004. Now Missile Defense Agency spokesman Rick  Lehner says there is no firm timetable for activating it.<p> 
			
			Creation of a missile defense system has been a goal of  many U.S. conservatives dating back to a space-based plan  developed under President Ronald Reagan two decades ago. Bush  touted his version during his re-election campaign.<p> 
			
			The current approach, to shield America and its allies from  missile attack by nations like North Korea, is based on the  concept of using one missile to shoot down another before it  can reach its target.<p> 
			
			"What we have here is a developmental system that is well  along," Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told a recent  briefing. "And at some point soon, it will have a modest  capability" and can be "perfected and improved" over time.<p> 
			
			Proponents argue even a rudimentary missile defense  capability is better than none at all. But the latest failure  presented another hurdle to the Pentagon's idea of deploying  the system piece by piece rather than waiting for every element  to be fully developed.<p> 
			
			"The system has no demonstrated capability to work under  realistic conditions. And so unless they just want it to be a  sham, I don't see how they can declare that they have real  operational capability," said Philip Coyle, chief weapons  tester for the Pentagon from 1994 to 2001.<p> 
			
			At the current testing pace, it could be decades before the  system is ready, Coyle said.<p> 
			
			RUMSFELD SOUNDS UNDETERRED<p> 
			
			Rumsfeld sounded undeterred. "We had hoped that we would  have some sort of a characterization that in 2004 we had a  preliminary capability, an initial capability," he said.<p> 
			
			"I'm not announcing it, but if you, for example, said that  ... there was some threat that was evolving and it would be  desirable to go out of a test mode and see the extent to which  you could be in an operational mode, my impression is it  wouldn't take long to get there."<p> 
			
			The Dec. 15 test was the system's first in two years. The  previous one, on Dec. 12, 2002, also was a failure, with the  interceptor not separating from its booster rocket and missing  its target by hundreds of miles.<p> 
			
			The next test could come in March or April, Lehner said,  although the cause of the Dec. 15 failure remains unknown.<p> 
			
			The Pentagon plans to spend more than $50 billion over the  next five years on missile defense and aims to weave in  airborne, ship- and space-based assets.<p> 
			
			It has installed six interceptor missiles in silos at Fort  Greely in Alaska and one at Vandenberg Air Force Base in  California. Vandenberg is due to get a second in January,  Lehner said, with 10 more in Alaska sometime in 2005.<p> 
			
			A Navy destroyer with long-range missile-tracking equipment  began patrols in September in the Sea of Japan -- the system's  first naval component.<p> 
			
			Among future capabilities, the Pentagon envisions missiles  based on ships that could bring down enemy missiles as they are  launched. It also sees an airborne laser defense to destroy  enemy missiles.<p> 
			
			Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control  Association, said the recent test showed even the most basic  elements of the system do not work.<p> 
			
			"The system is not ready for prime time. The booster  rockets do not work. The radar is limited in effectiveness. The  kill vehicle (which zeroes in on an enemy warhead) has a spotty  record. The computer system that coordinates all the elements  still has serious kinks in it," Kimball said.<p> 
			
			Kimball said the money spent on the system might be better  used to address pressing concerns like ensuring nuclear weapons  in former Soviet states do not fall into the hands of  terrorists and improving security at U.S. ports.
