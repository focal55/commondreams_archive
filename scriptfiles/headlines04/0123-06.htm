<!--/endimage/-->Attorney-General John Ashcroft was forced to defend the  conduct of the war in the face of criticism at a major world  summit.

				<P>"If you look at the United States and its performance, and  where it is in the world and what it does in the world, it's  not an aggressor," Ashcroft told the World Economic Forum in  Davos, Switzerland.

				<P>"The United States doesn't seek to consume territory or to  acquire an empire," he told the gathering, at which Washington  has at times faced criticism over its security policies and the  war in Iraq.

				<P>Ashcroft was speaking from the same platform where U.N.  chief Kofi Annan had earlier told delegates that global  security must not be dictated by the "laws of the jungle."  Annan told business leaders that collective international  security was at risk of falling apart.

				<P>The Secretary-General said the dangers stemmed not only  from terrorism itself but also from the way the war on terror  was fought, although he did not mention any country by name.

				<P>"Both international terrorism and the war against it have  the potential to overturn norms of behavior and human rights  standards...while also exacerbating cultural, religious and  ethnic dividing lines," Annan said.

				<P>"Business...has a powerful interest in helping to prevent  the international security system from sliding back into brute  competition based on the laws of the jungle," he told leaders  of some of the world's top companies.

				<P>Ashcroft, addressing a later session, went out of his way  to stress that the United States did not seek to "go it alone"  in the war on terror.

				<P>"We know in no uncertain terms that we are incapable of  having the kind of success alone that we could have working  together," he said.

				<P>"The United States needs, in a very significant way, the  wholehearted cooperation of our friends and freedom-loving  colleagues around the world, and we seek to improve our level."

				<P>Ashcroft also acknowledged that Washington needed to  communicate better with Muslims both in the United States and  around the world, to dispel the perception that the war on  terror was directed against Islam.

				<P>"We need to improve our performance and are interested in  finding ways to do that," he said.
