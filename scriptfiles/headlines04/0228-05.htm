SAN FRANCISCO &nbsp; - Black tuxedos, elegant dresses,
hair coiffed. For over two weeks now, people around the world
have seen images of hundreds of attractive gay and lesbian
couples marry in San Francisco.
<p>
 Nearly 3,400 same-sex couples, often accompanied by their
children and parents, have married at San Francisco's city hall
-- creating images that stand in big contrast to the typical
"leather daddies" and "biker-dykes" images seen two decades
ago.
 
<p>
 Analysts who study gay and lesbian issues say the recent
images are emblematic of the "mainstreaming" of gays and
lesbians in society in the past decade due to changes in the
gay and lesbian community and changes in how the media reports
gay and lesbian issues.
 
<p>
 "In the old dark days, one had to dress queer in order to
mark their differences from heterosexuals. That is no longer
the case today," said Jonathan Katz, executive coordinator of
the Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies at Yale
University in Connecticut.
 
<p>
 "Now, those old stereotype presentations are often brought
out for pure fun, at drag parties, for example," Katz said.
 
<p>
 The mainstreaming of the gay and lesbian community,
popularized in television shows like NBC's successful comedy
"Will and Grace" featuring openly gay characters, has also been
fed by the rising number of diverse openly gay men and women.
 
<p>
 "Gay and lesbians are a diverse community. They're your
uncles and aunts. They're white, black, Latino," said Joshua
Gamson, a sociology professor at the University of San
Francisco.
 
<p>
 "Earlier images tended to emphasize the community's sexual
wildness. The images we've seen recently help mainstream gays
because they help straight people see things about the gay
community and what it's become," said Gamson.
 
<p>

 Many media outlets on Thursday carried comments by comedian
Rosie O'Donnell after her San Francisco wedding that she and
her wife Kelli Carpenter would rush back to New York to attend
parents' day at their children's school rather than honeymoon.
 
<p>
 Such images might not have been widely reported by the
media years ago, said Edward Alwood, author of "Straight News,"
an account of how gays and lesbians have been portrayed in the
media.
 
<p>
 "Whether it was television or print, newsrooms were often
guided by running the stereotypical images in order to meet the
public's perceptions of what being gay meant," said Alwood, a
former CNN correspondent in the mid-1980s and now a journalism
professor at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.
 
<p>
 "It was almost like if editors didn't show the stereotypes,
like gays wearing mini-shorts, they weren't being objective,"
Alwood said.
 
<p>
 Alwood said coverage of gays and lesbians has changed
dramatically since the first documentary on gays appeared in
1967 on CBS.
 
<p>
 "In that documentary, they did an interview with a gay man
whose face was mostly obscured by a plant because they didn't
want to show his face. It's almost comical to think about it
now," said Alwood.
 
<p>
 Still, while public images of gays and lesbians have
changed over the years, that has not translated into widespread
support for same-sex marriages.
 
<p>
 Several polls in recent weeks have shown a majority of
Americans -- and Californians -- do not support the right of
gays and lesbians to marry.
