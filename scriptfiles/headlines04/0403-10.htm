<p> The White House was embroiled in a new dispute over withholding evidence from Congress yesterday &#173; this time over a hugely expensive reform of the Medicare health benefit program, whose true cost the Bush administration is accused of suppressing.</p>

<p>
The dispute, which is being compared to this week's controversy over whether the national security adviser Condoleezza Rice should give public testimony to the 9/11 Commission, is the latest chapter in the history of last November's Medicare bill, expanding prescription drug benefits for the elderly and disabled.</p>

<p>
The legislation was conceived by the White House as a pre-election strike against the Democrats, depriving the latter of an issue which had long favored them.</p>

<p>
Its initial passage in the House of Representatives, by a single vote, provoked accusations by Democrats of foul play, after the Republican House leadership kept the final vote open for three hours instead of the customary 15 minutes.
</p>

<p>
In that extended period, President George Bush and other senior figures lobbied wavering Republicans, worried that the advertised $395bn (&#163;210bn) cost of the measure over 10 years would add to the already soaring federal budget deficit.
</p>

<p>
There were allegations one swing Congressman was offered $100,000 of additional campaign finance to back the bill. That charge is under investigation by the House Ethics committee.
</p>

<p>
Medicare recipients have reacted with hostility. The Republicans now  risk losing support among older people.
</p>

<p>
The chief actuary of the program told the White House the cost would be $520bn over a decade, far above the $400bn level which 13 House Republicans had said was the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
Had the higher figure been known at the time, the entire bill might have been defeated. Richard Foster, the actuary, has said his superiors threatened to sack him if he told Congress of the higher figure.
</p>
<p>
This week, Thomas Scully, Medicare's then administrator, and Doug Badger, Mr Bush's top healthcare adviser, refused to appear before the House Ways and Means committee.</p>

<p>
Yesterday, the Republican majority on the panel was resisting legislators' demands for subpoenas against the two officials. But Democrats believe they could reverse that decision.
