LOS ANGELES  - 
Michael Moore's controversial
documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" moved a step closer to U.S.
theaters on Friday as Miramax film studio founders Harvey and
Bob Weinstein personally bought rights to the picture from Walt
Disney Co. .

Miramax had funded the film but Disney, which owns the
art-house studio, had declined to distribute the movie, saying
the documentary and its criticism of President Bush's war on
Iraq  were too politically charged.
<p>
 After more than three weeks of talks, the Weinsteins bought
rights to the film for costs to date, estimated at about &#36;6
million, and will arrange for theatrical and home video
distribution, both sides said in a statement issued on Friday.
<p>
 By clinching a deal now, the movie could still be on track
to get into theaters by the middle of this summer, despite a
crowded field of U.S. releases, distributors have said.
<p>
 That fast-track release would capitalize on the recent
surge of interest in the film and give Moore a chance to
influence the November presidential election with his
unflattering portrait of Bush.
<p>
 The Weinsteins would probably turn to a third-party
distributor to handle the film, and talks with such companies
already were under way while the brothers negotiated with
Disney, one distributor said.
<p>
 Moore sparked interest in the film in early May by saying
Disney had backed down from distributing the documentary out of
fear of political repercussions.
<p>
 Disney hotly denied that charge and in turn accused the
director of the anti-gun documentary "Bowling for Columbine" of
staging a publicity stunt to promote his film.
<p>
 "Fahrenheit 9/11" won this month the Palme d'Or, the
highest award of France's Cannes film festival , with its
portrayal of families affected by the war and U.S. government
policies in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks that
felled the World Trade Center.
<p>
 It is also expected to meet or beat the box-office
performance of "Columbine," which set a record for a U.S.
documentary with &#36;21.6 million in ticket sales.
<p>
 Talks are already under way between the Weinsteins and U.S.
distributors, with top contenders seen including Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp., Focus Features, a unit of General Electric
Co.'s NBC Universal., and privately held Newmarket Films.
Smaller ThinkFilm is also in the running for the U.S. rights
and deals have already been made for releases outside the
United States.
<p>
 Disney said that it could still profit if the film did well
but that it would donate any profit to charity. It did not name
the charity.
<p>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed but a person familiar
with it said that the charity component assured that neither
Disney nor the Weinsteins would do better under the deal than
if Disney had distributed it.			<p align="center">&copy; Copyright Reuters Ltd 2004.</p>
