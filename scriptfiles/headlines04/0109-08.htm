<p>BOMBAY  - Bombay is set to be the scene of six days of noisy protests against US policies, particularly the occupation of Iraq, as the world's anti-globalization activists hold their annual get-together.

<!--/endimage/-->While the tens of thousands of activists heading for the January 16-21 <a href="http://www.wsfindia.org/" target="_new">World Social Forum</a> (WSF) have already begun to spar -- with the far-left holding its own more militant meet -- one glue that binds the movement is fierce opposition to President George W. Bush.
<p>
 "It's now more or less proved that US foreign policies are against the basic concepts of humanity," said Tushar Joag, who is on the WSF central organizing committee.
<p>
 "We at the forum will oppose what the imperialist forces led by the US are up to," he said.
<p>
 He said organizers were even considering reserving one hall just for debates and demonstrations against US actions, particularly the war that ousted Saddam Hussein.
<p>
 "Hundreds of activists at any given time will be seen protesting and keeping the issue alive," Joag said. "The amphitheater that is coming up at the venue will also showcase anti-US plays and documentaries."
<p>
 The far-left, which denounces the World Social Forum as part of the globalized system, plans a march on the US consulate "to demand a withdrawal of the occupation forces from Iraq and show support for the resistance," said Darshan Pal, a co-organizer of "<a href="http://www.mumbairesistance.org/" target="_new">Resistance 2004</a>."
<p>
 But he acknowledged the march may be stopped by police.
<p>
 Bombay is already seeing the anti-US tone, with massive banners put up in the center of the city reading "Die Bush Die!" and "Smash US-led Imperialism!"
<p>
 The last World Social Forum, held in Porto Alegre in Brazil, turned into a rallying ground against the impending war in Iraq, with thousands of activists holding marches.
<p>
 Five hundred legislators also adopted a resolution stressing the need to avert war in Iraq and for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian territories.
<p>
 "Even then we were saying the war was for oil," said another WSF organizer., P.K. Das. "Nothing has changed which is why our entire focus will revolve around this at the present forum."
<p>
 It is the first time the World Social Forum is being held in Asia, in a bid to win supporters for the anti-globalization movement, which is dominated by Europeans and Latin Americans, in a continent that is home to half the world's population and suffers gaping inequalities.
<p>
 The forum was held annually since its inception in 2001 in Brazil, whose president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has been an icon for WSF activists.
<p>
 But the Brazilian  leader's fans do not include the far-leftists who are putting together Resistance 2004.
<p>
 "What has Lula really done? He's dictated by the IMF  and the World Bank," said Pal, the Resistance 2004 organizer.
<p>
 "The WSF says globalization should be humanized. We think it cannot be humanized. We have to fight the US imperialism against the world," he said.
<p>
 Pal said Resistance 2004 would draw at least 2,000 people, compared with the 75,000 registered to attend the World Social Forum.
<p>
Among those slated to attend the WSF are about 1,000 activists from the United States, including from the American Friends Service Committee, a pacifist Quaker group, and from the United Electrical Workers Union and Tennessee Industrial Renewal Network, both labor movements.
<p>
Some activists will attend both the WSF and Resistance 2004 such as Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, known for her staunch criticism of US policies.
<p>
Organizers said Roy is scheduled to attend anti-war workshops at both meets.
