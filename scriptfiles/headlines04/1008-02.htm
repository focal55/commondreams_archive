<p>OSLO - Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai  became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize on  Friday, honored for aiding democracy and seeking to save the  continent's shrinking forests.<p> 
			
			"It cannot get any better than this -- maybe in heaven,"  Maathai told Reuters after learning of the award. She wept with  delight and planted a tree in her home town of Nyeri in the  shadow of Mount Kenya, Africa's second highest peak.<p>

Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize October 8, 2004 for aiding the continent's poor with a campaign to plant millions of trees to slow down deforestation. 'Peace on earth depends on our ability to secure our living environment,' the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Ole Danbolt Mjoes, said in announcing the winner. He praised her 'contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.' Maathai is seen in this December 2002 file picture. Photo by Juda Ngwenya/Reuters<br>

The award marks a new environmental theme in interpreting  the 1895 will of Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel, the  inventor of dynamite who founded the prestigious prize. Until  now it has often gone to people seeking to end armed conflicts.<p> 
			
			"Peace on earth depends on our ability to secure our living  environment," said Ole Danbolt Mjoes, the head of the Norwegian  Nobel Committee. The prize is worth 10 million Swedish crowns  ($1.36 million) and will be handed out in Oslo on December 10.<p> 
			
			"We have emphasized the environment, democracy building and  human rights and especially women's rights," Mjoes said of the  prize. "We have added a new dimension to the concept of peace."<p> 
			
			Maathai's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159056040X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Green Belt Movement</a>, comprised mainly of women,  says it has planted 30 million trees across Africa to combat  creeping deforestation that often deepens poverty.
<p> 
			
			Mjoes said the movement also worked for family planning,  nutrition and a fight against corruption in Kenya. And Maathai  said that her grassroots movement could be a pre-emptive strike  to safeguard peace.<p> 
			
			"Many wars in the world are actually fought over natural  resources," she told NRK Norwegian radio. "In managing our  resources ... we plant the seeds of peace, both now and in the  future."<p> 
			
			GREEN THEME<p> 
			
			But some experts were unconvinced by the new green theme.<p> 
			
			"This prize could be positive in expanding the concept of  security, but it could also mean a dilution of the prize,  moving too far away from the original idea," said researcher  Espen Barth Eide at the Norwegian Institute of International  Affairs.<p> 
			
			He had tipped the U.N. nuclear watchdog and its head,  Mohamed ElBaradei for the award to reflect global fears that  terrorists or rogue states might obtain nuclear arms.<p> 
			
			But others argued that the environment could be a key to  global security. Tree plantings slow desertification, preserve  forest habitats for wildlife and provide a source of fuel,  building materials and food for future generations.<p> 
			
			"Understanding is growing throughout the world of the close  links between environmental protection and global security,"  said Klaus Toepfer, head of the U.N. Environment Program, in  hailing the award.<p> 
			
			And trees soak up carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed  for global warming. Many environmental experts say global  warming could be the biggest threat to life on the planet, with  more deserts, storms and rising sea levels.<p> 
			
			Maathai, born in 1940, is a zoology professor who rose to  international fame for campaigns against government-backed  forest clearances in Kenya in the late 1980s and 1990s.<p> 
			
			She is the 12th woman peace laureate since the first award  was made in 1901. The last African laureate was U.N. Secretary  General Kofi Annan, of Ghana, in 2001. The 2003 prize also went  to a woman, Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi.<p> 
			
			Experts estimate British colonialists and Kenyan farmers  have cleared about 75 percent of woodlands in the last 150  years, leaving two percent of Kenya's land under forest cover.<p> 
			
			In 1989 Maathai's protests forced then President Daniel  arap Moi to abandon a personal plan to erect a 62-storey office  tower in a Nairobi park. In 1999 she was beaten and whipped by  private security guards during a demonstration against the sale  of forest land near the capital Nairobi.<p> 
			
			In 2001, the 100th anniversary of the first award, the  committee mapped out possible new themes for peace.<p> 
			
			Geir Lundestad, the head of the Norwegian Nobel Institute,  said at the time that the award might shift in its second  century to honor new types of activists such as  environmentalists, rock stars, perhaps even journalists.
