<p>SANTIAGO, Chile - Many Chileans tortured during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet are rejecting a government offer of symbolic payments more than 30 years later, demanding substantial compensation instead and legal action against torturers.

<P>Chile has been reliving the horrors of the early 1970s since the late November release of a multiple-volume report on state-sponsored torture. That report, by a government-appointed commission led by a retired Catholic bishop, documented more than 27,000 cases of torture. It also determined that torture was state policy under Pinochet, not the work of renegade officers, as Chile's armed forces had contended.

<P>Earlier this month, Chilean President Ricardo Lagos offered victims a monthly payment of just less than $200 a month for life, a bit under the Chilean minimum monthly wage. He also promised health and education benefits for families of torture victims.

<P>Rather than putting history to rest, though, the offer stung many victims.

<P>"Indemnification must be just, as set out by the 14th Article of the U.N. Convention Against Torture," said Mireya Garcia, who leads a group of torture victims who're demanding bigger cash payouts and prosecution.

<P>The United Nations convention, ratified by more than 130 countries, including Chile, requires that countries ensure in their legal systems that victims have "an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation."

<P>Many Chilean torture victims feel the offer is paltry, given that many of their lives were destroyed and that the torturers live among them unpunished. Moreover, victims once released, often were denied the right to study in state universities and, in effect, the ability to pursue professional careers.

<P>Maria Huerta was a 20-year-old student leader in the port city of Valparaiso when Pinochet seized power in a bloody U.S.-backed coup on Sept. 11, 1973. She'd been studying business administration and supported the government of elected socialist Salvador Allende. After being arrested and tortured in the early weeks of the coup, she was forced to leave school.

<P>"I think that if I hadn't had to quit, I could be a professional today. My life would have been very different from what it is," said Huerta, 51, who lives off odd jobs.

<P>She said compensation should reflect decades of lost opportunity. "The state is responsible for what happened. All this was institutional, not something individual. It was the Chilean army, not just some people."

<P>Chile has the highest per capita military spending in Latin America. Its army is funded under the country's current constitution through earnings from state copper sales and its spending remains largely off-limits to lawmakers and the executive branch. Many torture victims say the military should use its money to compensate them.

<P>The Chilean army, following the commission report, acknowledged that torture was an institutional problem. Other branches of the armed forces haven't, however, nor has the court system, which the commission said had tolerated the abuses. On Friday, Chile's Supreme Tribunal, its highest court, rejected that finding.

<P>Torture victims also are upset that the report leaves out the names of accused torturers and keeps all cases private for 50 years, unless individuals decide to publicize their cases. The civil rights group Human Rights Watch immediately warned that this stipulation gives torturers a half-century of privacy and effectively covers up their acts.

<P>The Former Political Prisoners Coalition presented a list of 2,000 people who it said carried out human rights abuses in Chile and called on the government to seek them out for trial.

<P>The commission, whose chairman was Bishop Sergio Valech, found that the Chilean military and police tortured 27,255 people during Pinochet's bloody 17-year rule. Most of the abuse occurred in the first years after the coup.

<P>Of the victims, at least 3,400 were women, most of whom were sexually abused. There were also 88 detainees under the age of 12. Authorities had seized children in hopes of extracting information from their parents.

<P>The commission report established that torture took place on the Esmeralda, a tall-masted ship now used for training naval cadets and serving as Chile's goodwill ambassador in U.S. and other foreign ports.

<P>Huerta was one of a group of women taken to the Esmeralda to be tortured on the first day of the coup. She was held there for two days, moved and then brought back for tougher torture. Men and women were stripped naked, held together and were subjected to beatings and cavity searches.

<P>"We became confused over how long we were there. We couldn't tell night from day. We don't know if it was seven, eight or nine days," Huerta said. "It was a loss of human dignity to be stripped, and many sailors were laughing at us."

<P>For years, Esmeralda victims were ignored or told the events never occurred. Now their suffering is documented in the commission report. The navy concedes torture did occur, but with the caveat that outside forces, not sailors, conducted the onboard torture.

<P>"It's almost laughable. We are all very upset," Huerta said.

<P>Victims like her want to change the Esmeralda's designation from goodwill ambassador for Chile - the ship participated in bicentennial celebrations for the Statue of Liberty in 1886 and last called at a U.S. port this past April - to that of floating horror museum.
