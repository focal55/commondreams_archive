Maathai, Kenya's deputy environment minister and the first  African woman to win the Peace Prize, said sweeping changes  were needed to restore a "world of beauty and wonder" by  overcoming challenges ranging from AIDS to climate instability.<p> 
			
			"Activities that devastate the environment and societies  continue unabated," Maathai, founder of a campaign to plant 30  million trees across Africa to slow deforestation, said in an  acceptance speech at the ceremony in Oslo City Hall.<p> 
			
			"Today we are faced with a challenge that calls for a shift  in our thinking, so that humanity stops threatening its  life-support system," Maathai, 64, told an audience of about  1,000 people including Norway's King Harald and Queen Sonja.<p> 
			
			"I call on leaders, especially in Africa, to expand  democratic space and build fair and just societies," she said.<p> 
			
			"Further, industry and global institutions must appreciate  that ensuring economic justice, equity and ecological integrity  are of greater value than profits at any cost," she said.<p> 
			
			Grassroots citizens' movements should be encouraged.<p> 
			
			Maathai collected a gold Nobel medal and a diploma to a  standing ovation from 1,000 guests. She will separately receive  a check for 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.48 million). She will  use the cash to expand her Green Belt Movement around the  world.<p> 
			
			HEAL EARTH<p> 
			
			"We are called to assist the Earth to heal her wounds and  in the process heal our own," she said. The Nobel Prizes were  set up in the 1895 will of Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel,  10 years before Norway won independence from Sweden.<p> 
			
			Her tree-planting movement, led mostly by women, aims to  produce firewood, building materials and also to slow  desertification. It also works for women's rights, democracy  and peace.<p> 
			
			Maathai said a stream where she used to see frogs and  tadpoles as a child 50 years ago had dried up. "The challenge  is to restore the home of the tadpoles and give back to our  children a world of beauty and wonder," she said.<p> 
			
			Maathai also said the environment was a barometer of a  nation's health. Some critics have said environmentalism has  too little to do with peace to warrant the Nobel accolade.<p> 
			
			"The state of any country's environment is a reflection of  the kind of governance in place, and without good governance  there can be no peace," she said.<p> 
			
			She said the world was facing a "litany of woes" including  corruption, violence against women and children and diseases  like AIDS or malaria.<p> 
			
			In an interview with Reuters, she brushed aside questions  about her past suggestions that the deadly AIDS virus might  have been the result of a laboratory experiment gone awry.<p> 
			
			"I really don't know. I really don't have any idea. I'm not  an expert in this field," she said. She has also denied  suggestions that scientists might have created the virus as a  biological weapon against Africans.<p> 
			
			Maathai also urged peoples of the world to plant trees at  Easter, when Christians believe Christ rose from the dead after  being crucified on a wooden cross.<p> 
			
			Prizes for physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and  economics will be handed out in Stockholm on Friday.
