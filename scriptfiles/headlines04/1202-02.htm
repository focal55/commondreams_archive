<p> The fact thousands of protesters faced dozens of cops with not one person being
 arrested Wednesday had both sides calling Wednesday's protests in downtown
Halifax a big success. <P>

 <!--/endimage/-->"I couldn't be happier," said Tamara Lorincz of the <a href="http://hfxpeace.chebucto.org/" target="_new">Halifax Peace Coalition</a>,
 main organizer of the rally. "Look at how many people came out on the streets
 because they care." 
 <P>She expected about 2,000 people would show their anger at American President
 George W. Bush's presence in Halifax, but police estimate 4,000 people showed
 up. <P>Ms. Lorincz praised police, saying they helped the protest go smoothly. <P>A Wednesday afternoon release signed by Halifax Regional Police Chief Frank
 Beazley and RCMP Supt. Vern Fraser praised drivers for their patience during
 traffic disruptions. <P>"We would also like to acknowledge the Halifax Peace Coalition and other
 organizers of the public demonstration for their support and co-operation in
 ensuring a peaceful event," they wrote. <P>Halifax's Grand Parade was the launch pad for the noisy rally. <P>Thousands of enthusiastic protesters, ranging from parents with bundled-up
 newborns to grannies with canes, milled about listening to speeches and music. <P>The throng grew shortly after 10 a.m., when hundreds of university students
 arrived to loud cheers from Saint Mary's, Dalhousie and other campuses. By the
 time protesters hit Barrington Street for the march to the main protest site by
 Pier 21, the chanting human convoy clogged six city blocks. Other protesters
 went to nearby Cornwallis Park for speeches and singing. <P>Wolfville's Bill O'Brien travelled with friends to Halifax for his first
 protest. <P>"I'm just amazed at the kind of energy that exists here with young people and
 old people. I'm glad to be part of it. I wish I had started 45 years ago." <P>He said he felt strongly about being part of the effort to send a message to the
 "smug jerk." <P>"He just can't influence the rest of the world with a sledgehammer." <P>At 11:05 a.m., the coalition's marchers arrived at Pier 21, where they joined
 about 500 protesters already stationed behind barricades on Marginal Road. On
 the other side of the barricade stood about 60 police officers wearing ball
 hats and body armour, with batons and gas masks strapped to their belts. <P>A few police dogs were among the officers, and sharpshooters were on the
 rooftops of three surrounding buildings. Officers handed protesters pamphlets
 advising them of their rights and the duties of police. <P>Some cops chatted with protesters across the two sets of fencing erected as
 barricades. Some posed for pictures, and one officer told bystanders that
 sharpshooters could use rifle scopes to count the freckles on someone's nose
 from 500 metres. <P>St. Agnes School student Kris Boudreau, 14, skipped morning classes to protest
 with his parent's permission. <P>"They don't like Bush either," he said. <P>The protest grew loudest at 11:15 a.m., when a motorcade of about 15
 motorcycles, limousines, minivans and an armoured truck approached Pier 21 from
 the south side of Marginal Road. <P>Almost everyone booed or chanted "Bush go home," while a handful of supporters
 waved the Stars and Stripes. The motorcade didn't come within 150 metres of the
 protest site. <P>"I was expecting him to at least have the guts to go in the main entrance so
 that we could see him," Swedish-American NSCAD University student Sara Callahan
 said of Mr. Bush. <P>

   Thousands march in Halifax, Nova Scotia where U.S. President George W. Bush delivered a speech on December 1, 2004. The two-hour stop was part of a two-day visit to Canada. Photos by Jan Meyerowitz <a href="http://hfxpeace.chebucto.org/" target="_new">Halifax Peace Coalition</a><br>

Many protesters soon left the area, hoping to disrupt traffic or encounter Mr.
 Bush's motorcade near Spring Garden Road. About 200 remained at the barricades
 when the motorcade left, and gave the far-off vehicles a second round of boos.
 They walked away, and police removed the barricades at 12:45 p.m. 
 <P>Halifax filmmaker Jason Shipley called the event a success. <P>"I think we got our message across in a way that Nova Scotians wanted to, which
 is peacefully but forcefully." <P>Asked what that message is, he said it's about keeping Canadian values. <P>"They have to do with peace, they have to do with natural resources, they have
 to do with the social safety net." <P>Dalhousie student John Shiff, 18 of Ottawa carried an American flag during the
 event. <P>"I am a Jew. I believe that George Bush is the greatest thing that has happened
 to Israel. Without him, we wouldn't be anything." <P>He saw ugly things Wednesday, specifically a protester's American flag festooned
 with a Swastika. <P>"I saw those, and they just made me want to absolutely puke." <P>Bill Finbow of Dartmouth, the man carrying the flag, said he didn't want to
 offend Americans or descendants of those killed by the Nazis. <P>"I think it's the way the world properly perceives the American flag in its
 unbastardized form, given their domestic and foreign policy." <P>Halifax Mayor Peter Kelly said protesters and police deserve credit for a
 peaceful day. <P>"I think everybody did what they had to do without crossing the line." <P>The protesters that left Pier 21 marched to Spring Garden Road and South Park
 Street, where they blocked traffic for half an hour while banging drums and
 chanting. Police then moved the group of about 500, who gathered for another
 half-hour at Spring Garden Road and Barrington Street. After that, they moved
 to the Grand Parade, but dispersed soon after.</p>
