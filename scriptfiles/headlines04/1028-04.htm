A 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS crew in Iraq shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein was in the area where tons of explosives disappeared, and may have videotaped some of those weapons. </p>
<p>The missing explosives are now an issue in the presidential debate. Democratic candidate John Kerry is accusing President Bush of not securing the site they allegedly disappeared from. President Bush says no one knows if the ammunition was taken before or after the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003 when coalition troops moved in to the area.</p>
<p>Using GPS technology and talking with members of the 101st Airborne Division, 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has determined the crew embedded with the troops may have been on the southern edge of the Al Qaqaa installation, where the ammunition disappeared. The news crew was based just south of Al Qaqaa, and drove two or three miles north of there with soldiers on April 18, 2003. </p>
<p>During that trip, members of the 101st Airborne Division showed the 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS news crew bunker after bunker of material labelled "explosives." Usually it took just the snap of a bolt cutter to get into the bunkers&nbsp;and see the material identified by the 101st as detonation cords. </p>
<p>"We can stick it in those and make some good bombs." a soldier told our crew. </p>
<p>In one bunker, there were boxes marked with the name "Al Qaqaa", the munitions plant where tons of explosives allegedly went missing.</p>
<p>Once the doors to the bunkers were opened, they weren't secured. They were left open when the 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS crew and the military went back to their base. </p>
<p>"We weren't quite sure what were looking at, but we saw so much of it and it didn't appear that this was being secured in any way," said photojournalist Joe Caffrey.&nbsp;"It was several miles away from where military people were staying in their tents".</p>
<p>Officers with the 101st Airborne told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS that the bunkers were within the U.S. military perimeter and protected. But Caffrey and former 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS Reporter Dean Staley, who spent three months together&nbsp;in Iraq, said Iraqis were coming and going freely.</p>
<p>"At one point there was a group of Iraqis driving around in a pick-up truck,"Staley said. "Three&nbsp;or four guys we kept an eye on, worried they might come near us." </p>
<p><br />On Wednesday, 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS e-mailed still images of the&nbsp;footage taken&nbsp;at the site&nbsp;to experts in Washington to see if the items captured on tape are the same kind of high explosives that went missing in Al Qaqaa. Those experts could not make that determination. </p>

<p>The footage is now in the hands of security experts to see if it is indeed the explosives in question</p>
