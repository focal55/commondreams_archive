<p>There's been much night-vision hype and a lot of huff and puff
about this week's US assault on the Iraqi city of Falluja. But
perhaps a more accurate, if accidental, assessment was in the name
given to the exercise by its planners: Phantom Fury.</p>
<p>The "fury" was evident in the pre-attack briefings for US
troops. They were told they were "making history" ... this was
another Iwo Jima; it was Hue city revisited; they were required "to
kick some butt!" Indeed, the only sentiment expressed by individual
troops in their CNN sound bites was anger. But there were a few
"phantoms", too.</p>
<p>After months of claims that Falluja was a hornets' nest of as
many as 6000 insurgents, it seemed that most had packed their
rocket-propelled grenades and left town when the Marines arrived.
And as US forces entered the city, many of their supposed "allies"
from the new US- and Australian-trained Iraqi security services had
deserted rather than face the insurgents.</p>
<p>We had breathless accounts of US forces taking the Falluja
hospital "without a shot being fired"; of them "thundering" into
the city, then capturing a third of it; "much of the city seemed
abandoned"; then the US was in control of 70 per cent of it; and on
Wednesday, this anticlimax in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>:
"Finally, troops reached the Al Hadra al Muhammadia mosque. 'This
is the nerve center of the resistance - and we're here,' said
Captain Theodore Bethea, Charlie Company commander. Inside, the
troops found a weapons cache that included several rocket-propelled
grenade launchers. AK-47 rifles ... and materials for homemade
bombs ... Marine officials said four guerillas were killed in the
attack on the mosque."</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody was home.</p>
<p>In an avalanche of reports from media "embeds" with the US
forces, the death toll among the insurgents is anywhere between 85
and 600 - which means that 5400 or more got away.</p>
<p>And after months of US insistence that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the
Jordanian-born terrorist ring leader in Iraq, was hiding in the
city and that was why his "safe houses" had to be bombed, various
US officials admitted on the eve of the attack that Zarqawi had
probably fled ... if he had ever been there.</p>

<p>All of which means this US military exercise was as successful
as the attack on Tora Bora in Afghanistan late in 2001 - back then
US forces came down from the Afghan mountains claiming that they
had killed hundreds of Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, but perhaps
three times as many got away - including Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>None of this is to underestimate or ignore the atrocities
carried out in the name of the insurgents. But it all raises
serious questions about the US campaign in Iraq. Apart from the
fact they are still attempting to "liberate" swathes of the country
20 months after invading, the outcome of the assault on Falluja
undermines the Americans' implicit belief that legitimacy comes
from the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p>It's only weeks since the US claimed to have routed the
insurgents in Samarra, another Sunni-dominated city north of
Baghdad. Special military flights flew reporters into Samarra for a
briefing by Major-General John Batiste: "Anti-Iraqi forces have
been defeated and this city has been returned to the people." And,
it seems, the insurgents.</p>
<p>In what appeared to be a campaign of attacks everywhere in Iraq
- except Falluja - this week, up to 50 people died and as many
again were injured in coordinated strikes in Samarra. It's not
unreasonable to ask how many of the 5400 or more insurgents who
might have escaped from Falluja are hunkering down in Samarra. Or
in Ramadi where 20 marines were injured in a suicide bomb attack;
or in bombings elsewhere that took dozens of Iraqi lives as
insurgents went on the rampage.</p>
<p>The Americans invested months in planning this attack. They
brought in 10,000 of their own forces and as many as 2000 more
Iraqis, but still they were unable to stop the insurgents leaving
Falluja in their thousands. And for all their bluster and professed
confidence in the new Iraqi forces, it is apparent again that while
the insurgency has infiltrated the Iraqi security agencies, Iraqi
forces have been unable or unwilling to infiltrate the ranks of the
insurgency or to stand and fight them.</p>
<p>Anne Garrels, a US National Public Radio reporter with the
Marines at Falluja, told her US radio audience that about
two-thirds of the 500 "elite" Iraqi troops who were to accompany
the Marines into Falluja had deserted.</p>
<p>There will be much American chest-beating over the retaking of
Falluja, especially after the failure of their April siege of the
city. But as the insurgency is demonstrating with the havoc it
caused elsewhere in Iraq this week, this US success is likely to
have the same negligible impact on the insurgency as the December
capture of Saddam Hussein and the appointment of Iyad Allawi's
puppet regime.</p>
<p>As the attack on Falluja was getting under way, Slate
commentator Fred Kaplan warned that the insurgents would live to
fight another day: "Falluja isn't Masada or the Alamo, some
last-ditch outpost where the rebels whoop their final battle cry,
rally for one more round of resistance, then pass into history when
their last rifleman falls."</p>
<p>The US still looks at Iraq in conventional military terms,
rather than as the guerilla war it has become. Whether it was
Castro and Guevara in Cuba, Masoud in the Panjshir Valley or the
Chechen or Vietnam conflict, a guerilla force does not have to
"win" in order to win; it only has to duck and weave, to keep
dancing and to concede territory when it has to while opening new
fronts when it needs to, to create utter chaos.</p>

<p>This battle of Falluja will be written into Arab and Muslim
poetry and propaganda, just as the April siege was. And it's
affecting - and infecting - Iraq's political process. The only
Sunni political party in the country's appointed government is
threatening to quit and Sunni lobby groups have stepped up their
campaign for the 20 per cent-plus of Iraqis who are Sunnis to
boycott the national polls which Washington insists must be held by
the last week in January.</p>
<p>The American belief is that if Falluja can be pacified,
elections can proceed.</p>
<p>But where does the road go after Falluja? George Bush has won
domestic legitimacy by his re-election. But his "coalition of the
willing" in Iraq is becoming less willing with as many as 14 of his
partners pulling out, thinking about it or reducing their numbers;
and democracy advocates are questioning the legitimacy of the
proposed Iraqi elections in the face of an unseemly lobby attempt
to lock in the result before a single vote is cast.</p>
<p>When Washington's case for war against Iraq over weapons of mass
destruction fell apart, it resorted to the urgent need for free,
fair and competitive elections in what would be a democratic
beachhead in the Middle East. But in <i>The Washington Post</i>
this week, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Marina
Ottaway, wrote: "Elections as they should be in a democracy are
what the US promised ... [but does it now want to convert the poll]
into a referendum on a single list of candidates and thus send a
message to all Middle East regimes that it agrees with them, that
free elections are too risky for such a volatile corner of the
world?"</p>
<p>A key aspect of the election is that instead of voting for
individual MPs from which a government would be chosen, Iraqis will
be asked to endorse pre-arranged "slates" of names which constitute
an agreed power-sharing arrangement between those on the slate and
the parties they represent.</p>
<p>Again all the force of the US embassy in Baghdad is up against
the unmovable object of the intentions of the spiritual leader of
Iraq's Shiite majority, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. With Shiites
claiming to represent as much as 65 per cent of the population they
are determined to have a Shiite administration.</p>
<p>An obvious slate is the existing appointed regime of Iyad Allawi
- or a variation thereof - which is being backed by the Americans.
But there are growing fears that Allawi could end up in the losers'
corner, particularly if al-Sistani achieved his objective of
preventing a Shiite split.</p>

<p>The two Shiite religious parties in interim government have
clubbed together, but they are up against an unlikely alliance of
Ahmad Chalabi, the disgraced former Pentagon favorite as leader of
liberated Iraq, and Moqtada Al-Sadr, the firebrand militia leader
who has spent much of the last year at war with the Americans but
who now claims to have joined the political process. Obviously,
theirs would be an anti-US ticket.</p>
<p>Despite al-Sistani's claims to be above the political process,
the unelected mullah has intervened whenever he believes necessary
and usually with dramatic effect, to protect Shiite interests. His
latest intervention is the establishment of his personal commission
to broker deals between the different Shiite political parties and
personalities to ensure they do present a single Shiite slate for
Shiites to endorse.</p>
<p>Allawi is a secular Shiite whose popular support, along with
that of his appointed administration, is falling. His Iraqi
National Accord Party is distrusted by many Shiites because it
includes many Sunnis who joined Allawi while in exile during
Saddam's regime.</p>
<p>Allawi's problem as he faces a poll that many Sunnis will
boycott, is that he does not have a strong party of his own or one
that might join him to draw substantial Shiite backing.</p>
<p>His defeat would be a blow for Washington. But as Ottaway put it
in the <i>Post</i>: "The formation of a government dominated by
religious parties would be a humiliation for the Bush
Administration, a sign that, again, the reality of Iraq has trumped
American plans. By trying to absorb the Shiite parties into a
monster coalition, the US hopes to dilute their influence."</p>
