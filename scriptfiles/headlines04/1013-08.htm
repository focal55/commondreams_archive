<p>MONTEVIDEO  - Freedom of expression worldwide has been under 
threat since agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) last 
week seized two Internet servers hosting websites of the <a href="http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml" target="_new">Independent Media 
Centers</a>. In Latin America, <a href="http://www.midiaindependente.org/" target="_new">Indymedia Brazil</a> and Uruguay are directly affected.

					  
<p>"The incident resembles a Kafka novel," Pablo Ortellado of Indymedia 
Brazil told IPS in an e-mail interview. "Our equipment was seized and we 
don't exactly know when, by whom or why."

<p>The servers confiscated on Oct. 7 were located in the UK premises of 
Rackspace, a U.S.-based company, and hosted 21 sites.

<p>Indymedia is a network of more than 140 websites worldwide. It was 
established in 1999 to report alternative viewpoints on the World Trade 
Organization's conference in Seattle, and is now a major source of 
information for the anti-globalization movement.

<p>Anyone can publish on Indymedia. According to "Libertinus," an activist 
at <a href="http://uruguay.indymedia.org/" target="_new">Indymedia Uruguay</a>, the medium is one of the "most effective forms of 
free flow of information."

<p>Indymedia Brazil managed to return online 24 hours after the seizure. 
Still, some of their material is missing. For Indymedia in Uruguay, one of 
the smallest Latin American countries, the situation is much more precarious.

<p>"If the recovery work is going well, the entire website might be back on 
air next week," reckons Libertinus. Yet, "a great part will be impossible 
to retrieve, in particular the multimedia archives," the activist told IPS.

<p>The main consequences are, however, political rather than technical, 
claims Ortellado, as the incident demonstrated that a government can seize 
equipment of an independent communication medium in a foreign country, on 
the basis of foreign law, without formal charges and without being required 
to release information about its actions.


<p>Until now, nobody seems to know why Indymedia was targeted. The seizure 
could be related to the publication of pictures on one of its French sites, 
showing Swiss undercover police photographing protestors. If this suspicion 
is confirmed, says Ortellado, we will have witnessed the violation of civil 
rights on a global scale.

<p>"Swiss police, protesting against news on a French website hosted on an 
English server get the American government to seize the server and take 
more than 20 independent media sites off-line," he says.

<p>Libertinus believes the incident was an intentional attempt at sabotage, 
to intimidate a network that has been growing considerably in the past 
months, and represents a threat to the world's powerful.

<p>The authorities of at least four countries, Switzerland, Italy, the 
United Kingdom and the United States, might be involved in the seizure, 
suggests an Indymedia press release.

<p>Federal prosecutors in both Switzerland and Italy have confirmed they 
are investigating Indymedia, and the Italian prosecutor reportedly said 
there are suspicions the network may "support terrorism," says Indymedia.

<p>A representative for the network in the United States said the group 
still has received no official explanation for the shutdown. "But 
apparently this morning the Swiss said they had never asked the FBI to 
seize the servers, just that they were looking at the photos (of undercover 
police)," David Meieran of Indymedia Pittsburgh told IPS.


<p>"Ten to 15 days ago there was a communication between the FBI and 
Rackspace, although we were not informed of this. It's a plausible 
inference that these photos were involved," he added.

<p>To date, six of the websites had resumed operating, said Meieran.

<p>In a statement issued Oct. 8, Rackspace claims to have acted "in 
compliance with a court order pursuant to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty 
(MLAT), which establishes procedures for countries to assist each other in 
investigations such as international terrorism, kidnapping and money 
laundering."

<p>However, representatives of the two Latin American sites do not accept 
Rackspace's explanation. "It is no justification but an excuse allowing the 
FBI to use their methods all over the world," says Libertinus. Ortellado 
calls the incident a serious affront against freedom of expression and of 
the press.

<p>"If the American government was able to force an American company based 
in a foreign country to hand over the servers of a media organization using 
arbitrary methods and without going through a transparent judicial process, 
there is no reason why the same methods could not be used again in other 
circumstances, in other countries, targeting other organizations."

<p>Indymedia is currently being working with the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation (EFF) on possible responses it could take to the seizure. 
According to Ortellado, other organizations such as the Center for 
Constitutional Rights have offered their assistance.


<p>EFF Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl writes on the organization's website: 
"This seizure has grave implications for free speech and privacy. The 
constitution does not permit the government unilaterally to cut off the 
speech of an independent media outlet, especially without providing a 
reason or even allowing Indymedia the information necessary to contest the 
seizure."

<p>According to the general secretary of the International Federation of 
Journalists (IFJ), Aidan White, "We have witnessed an intolerable and 
intrusive international police operation against a network specializing in 
independent journalism. The way this has been done smacks more of 
intimidation of legitimate journalistic inquiry than crime-busting."

<p>In an Indymedia news release, Libertinus explains the particular 
consequences of the seizure for his country. "Uruguay has a long history of 
media repression. We don't have the money to pay for web hosting, and so we 
rely on the solidarity of other countries."

<p>"Actions like the seizure of the servers make the whole world insecure for 
free media. Uruguay's national elections will take place on Oct. 31. It's a 
bad time for this to happen."
