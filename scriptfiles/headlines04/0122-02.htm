<p>MANCHESTER, N.H.  - Democrat John Kerry, riding a  wave of momentum from his Iowa caucus victory, grabbed a  three-point lead over Howard Dean in New Hampshire five days  before the state's presidential primary, according to a  Reuters/MSNBC/Zogby poll released on Thursday.

<P>Kerry, a Massachusetts senator whose come-from-behind win  in Iowa reshaped the Democratic presidential race, led Dean 27  percent to 24 percent in the latest three-day tracking poll,  which began the day of Iowa's caucuses.

  <!--/endimage/-->Kerry stretched his lead over Dean, who limped to a distant  third-place finish in Iowa, to 11 points in the most recent day  of polling on Wednesday.

				<P>"Kerry not only jumps into the lead, but today his lead was  commanding," pollster John Zogby said. "Remember, we still have  one-third of the sample taken before the Iowa caucus."

				<P>A tracking poll combines the results of three consecutive  nights of polling, then drops the first night's results each  time a new night is added. It allows pollsters to record shifts  in voter sentiment as they happen.

				<P>The poll found voters were still changing their minds about  Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire, with Kerry gaining four  percentage points and Dean dropping one percentage point.  Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, in third place, continued to slip  slightly each day, dropping one percentage point to 15 percent.

				<P>North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, fresh from his surprise  second place finish in Iowa, held fourth place with 8 percent,  a gain of one point. Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman was at 7  percent, down one point.

				<P>Zogby said Edwards did not seem to have gotten a big bounce  from Iowa yet, although "it normally takes two full days before  we see a major impact from any event."

				<P>A total of 17 percent of New Hampshire voters are still  undecided about the primary, up one percentage point.

				<P>Zogby said Dean's fevered, arm-pumping speech after the  caucuses on Monday "had no negative impact on young voters at  all in New Hampshire," although Kerry had moved even with or  ahead of Dean among most other voter categories.

				<P>The switch at the top represents a dramatic turnaround for  both Kerry and Dean. The former Vermont governor soared to a  more than 20-point lead in New Hampshire polls late last year,  but Kerry roared back in Iowa's final two weeks as voters began  to re-evaluate which Democrat was best suited to challenge  President Bush in November.

				<P>The poll of 601 likely primary voters was taken Monday  through Wednesday and has a margin of error of 4.1 percentage  points. It will continue through Tuesday, the day of the New  Hampshire primary.

				<P>Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich received 1 percent in the poll,  with civil rights activist Al Sharpton getting less than 1  percent.
