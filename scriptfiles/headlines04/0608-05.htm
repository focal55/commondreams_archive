<p>Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shia leader whose militiamen have been fighting the US occupation forces in several Iraqi cities, was banned yesterday from standing in Iraq's forthcoming democratic elections. 
<p>Paul Bremer, the US administrator in Iraq, signed an order stating that, with immediate effect, members of illegal militias "will be barred from holding political office for three years after leaving their illegal organization".  
<p>Even if Mr Sadr disbanded his Mahdi Army in the next few weeks it would be too late for him to join Iraq's political process and contest the elections, due in January.  
<p>The armed uprising which he began in April has polarized the Shia community but has a large following of the young and unemployed. He could have expected a substantial vote for a seat in the new parliament.  
<p>The ban came as Britain and the US called for a UN security council vote today on the new draft resolution defining the division of power after sovereignty is returned to Iraq.  
<p>"We are putting it to a vote on Tuesday afternoon," US ambassador John Negroponte told reporters.  
<p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told the House of Commons that the resolution would give the interim government a say in coalition military operations as well as the power to pass laws, rescind laws passed by the Coalition Provisional Authority, and sign or change oil contracts.  
<p>Many of the arrangements are detailed not in the resolution itself but in annexed letters, a technique that has vexed France.  
<p>But Mr Straw said the letters between the US and the new Iraqi government, published   yesterday, defined the relationship between the new sovereign power and the coalition forces and "set out clearly the need to reach agreement on fundamental security and policy issues, including policy on sensitive offensive operations".  
<p>And he stressed that in any case the Iraqi government would after January 31 "have an absolute right" to call for a revision of the terms on which the multinational force operated, or for its withdrawal.  
<p>Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, says in his letter that the multinational force will coordinate with Iraqi security forces, and refer "issues up the respective chains of command where necessary".  
<p>He adds, however, that the force "must continue to function under a framework that affords the force the status they need to accomplish their mission, and in which the contributing states have responsibility for exercising jurisdiction over their personnel".  
<p>The draft has met with favorable noises from Germany and Russia, but France said last night that fine tuning was still required. Algeria, the only Arab member of the security council, also expressed reservations.  
<p>The delineation of power is important as it defines how the coalition will be able to deal with insurgents like Mr Sadr's militiamen after the June 30 transfer of power.  
<p>The ban on the militia members taking part in political life is a gamble, since it carries the risk that it will increase Mr Sadr's popularity and undermine the new government's search for democratic credibility in the eyes of the skeptical Iraqi public.
</div>
<p>It is part of a wider measure aimed at dissolving nine other militias by offering their members pensions, retraining, or integration into the new security forces.   
<p>These militias - with more than 100,000 men - are allied to parties which have members in the new government.  
<p>Militias which have not subscribed to the scheme became illegal yesterday.  
<p>Welcoming Mr Bremer's decree, Ayad Allawi, the new prime minister, said: "While recent news has associated the word 'militia' with the sort of violence orchestrated by Moqtada al-Sadr, in fact most of   these groups and individuals were part of the resistance against Saddam Hussein's regime. "To reward former resistance fighters for their service, opportunities have been created for them to join state security services or lay down their arms and enter civilian life."  
<p>All of the groups have agreed to register their men and have the membership lists independently monitored.   
<p>US officials hope that about 90% of the militiamen will have been demobilized or integrated into new security forces by the January elections.  
<p>They expect about 40% to retire or opt for civilian jobs.  
<p>Mr Allawi and his rival, the one-time US favorite Ahmad Chalabi, say they disbanded their own small militias some time ago.
