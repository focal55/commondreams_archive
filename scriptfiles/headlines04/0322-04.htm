<p>NEW YORK  - A US business group that monitors federal spending took out a full-page advert in The New York Times, likening President George W. Bush to a corrupt chief executive officer who has forfeited public trust.
<p>Timed to coincide with the weekend anniversary of the US-led war against Iraq, the advertisement -- paid for by <a href="http://www.sensiblepriorities.org/index.htm" target="_new">Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities</a> -- said Bush's case for invasion "was built entirely out of falsehoods."
<p>Highlighting the cost of the war in terms of hundreds of US casualties and tens of billions of dollars, the ad said the "state-sponsored deception" underpinning the conflict dwarfed the damage caused by the series of corporate scandals that recently rocked Wall Street.
<p>"It's past time for finger pointing," it said.
<p>"It's time for someone in this government to step forward and take personal responsibility for the deadly deceptions used to mislead this great nation into war.
<p>"And that someone must be George W. Bush."
<p>Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities was formed in 1996 on concerns that federal government spending priorities were undermining national security.
<p>The group's 500 members include the present or former CEOs of Bell Industries, Eastman Kodak and Goldman Sachs, as well as CNN founder Ted Turner.
