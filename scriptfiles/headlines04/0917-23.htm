<P>BAGHDAD -  Iraqi insurgents pressed their assault on U.S. and allied forces Thursday as two Americans and a Briton were kidnapped from their Baghdad house and three Marines were killed, bringing the number of U.S. military deaths in the country this month to at least 52.
<p> The brazen abduction of the employees of a Middle East-based construction firm continued a violent week that has left more than 200 Iraqis dead, and it followed a similar kidnapping of two Italian women from their office 10 days ago. <p> No one immediately claimed responsibility for the abduction, but almost all of the more than 120 kidnappings of foreigners in Iraq have been carried out by militant groups seeking to drive out U.S. forces, aid workers and foreign companies involved in supporting military and reconstruction efforts. <p> Most kidnappings of foreigners in Iraq have occurred on the nation's lawless roads, but the spread of abductions to homes and offices has sparked new fear among an international community already feeling besieged. Some companies have pulled out of the country, despite the money to be made on reconstruction projects.<p> The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad identified the two Americans as Jack Hensley and Eugene "Jack" Armstrong. Their ages and hometowns were not released. The British Embassy confirmed that the third man was one of its citizens, but it did not identify him. <p> An Iraqi government official said the three men worked for Gulf Services Co., based in the United Arab Emirates, but it was unclear whether they were security guards or held other positions with the firm. <p> After the abduction, police found the body of a blond man believed to be a Westerner, news agencies reported. The body, found north of Baghdad, was not immediately identified.<p> Eighteen months after U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq and ousted President Saddam Hussein, large swaths of the nation remain beyond the control of the U.S.-backed interim government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.<p> Sunni Muslim insurgents control vast areas west of Baghdad, and a largely Shiite Muslim rebel militia holds significant sway in areas of the capital and elsewhere. The nation's security forces are ill-equipped to impose order, despite a U.S.-led program to train and outfit tens of thousands of soldiers, police officers and other forces.<p> One of the most troubled and contentious areas is Al Anbar province west of Baghdad, which includes the tinderbox towns of Fallouja and Ramadi. The military said three Marines died Thursday as the result of enemy fire in separate incidents in the province. They were not immediately identified.<p> U.S. forces have stepped up offensive operations in the province, and Thursday and early today they launched four assaults targeting the network of Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant suspected in a wave of suicide bombings and kidnappings in Iraq.<p> U.S. forces bombed suspected Zarqawi strongholds in Fallouja and near the town of Qaryat ar Rufish, southwest of Fallouja, U.S. authorities said.<p> The latter attack, on a "terrorist meeting site," killed about 60 "foreign fighters," a U.S. statement said. That figure could not be verified.<p> If true, the attack would be one of the most deadly on insurgents in Iraq since the invasion in March 2003. Insurgents have long accused the U.S. military of inflating the number of guerrillas killed in operations.<p> U.S. forces also launched an offensive in Ramadi, a provincial capital in western Iraq and a place where Sunni insurgents have significant influence. The operation targeted the heretofore little-known Daham network, which U.S. officials said has ties to Zarqawi.<p> In addition to carrying out bombings and ambushes against U.S. and Iraqi forces, insurgents have abducted foreign civilians, apparently believing the tactic will scare away companies and workers and thereby slow the reconstruction plans. But there are indications that criminal gangs seeking ransoms may also be involved in the kidnappings. <p> Options are dwindling for foreign workers not already barricaded behind concrete blast walls in secure compounds, on U.S. bases or inside the Green Zone, the U.S.-guarded enclave in central Baghdad.<p> Thursday's abduction in the capital may have been an inside job involving at least one of the security guards assigned to protect the house, sources said.<p> Sabah Kadhim, spokesman for the Iraqi Interior Ministry, said the house was approached by "five masked men with weapons" who forced the three victims into a minivan. No shots were fired, he said. <p> A 23-year-old neighbor who gave his name as Majid said he saw unusual activity when he left his home to switch on a generator during a blackout. <p> "I heard voices that sounded like someone was trying to drag somebody else," he told Associated Press. "I was frightened and left the area, but when I came back to the foreigners' house, I saw that the outer gate was open and the foreigners' car had gone." <p> Another witness, 19-year-old Ziad Tareq, said he saw a man in black clothing dragging one of the hostages by the collar toward a vehicle, AP reported.<p> The abduction appears to be part of a new trend in which the captors carefully plan their attacks, gather intelligence and conduct surveillance of their victims, rather than merely seizing targets of opportunity.<p> On Sept. 7, Italian aid workers Simona Pari and Simona Torretta were abducted by gunmen from the central Baghdad office of their charitable organization, Bridge to Baghdad. Two of their Iraqi colleagues also were abducted. The four are still missing.<p> The captors knew who the Italians were and knew who they were targeting, said one foreign embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "People seem to know exactly who they're going for rather than being opportunistic."<p> Allawi's government, which makes security its central theme, has been helpless to stop the abductions.<p> Kadhim, the Interior Ministry spokesman, hinted that former intelligence officers in Hussein's government might be offering their services to gangs, helping to coordinate information-gathering on prospective abductees. <p> "If it's lucrative and you want information, there are people willing to supply it," he said. "We mustn't forget the complex intelligence service that was in place previously &#8212; all of whom are now out of a job."<p> The Mansour neighborhood where the Americans and Briton were abducted is an upscale one on the city's west side, known for its concentration of government officials' homes and foreign embassies and firms. Much of the area has numerous security guards, roadblocks and checkpoints.<p> Companies, aid groups and news organizations operating from houses in Baghdad often try to be as low-profile as possible. However, one Mansour resident said that outside the Gulf Services home, someone had hung a banner bearing the company's name, and that neighbors knew the habits and routines of the residents.<p> For example, he said, it was common knowledge that the abductees liked to eat breakfast in the home's garden about 6 every morning.<p> Some kidnappers have demanded that the victims' employers end their operations in Iraq, and the companies have often complied.<p> Several trucking firms have agreed not to return to the country after their drivers were snatched, and the Philippines withdrew a small contingent of troops this summer to secure the release of a truck driver.
