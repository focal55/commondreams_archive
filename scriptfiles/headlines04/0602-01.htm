<p>WASHINGTON -  Fourteen months after reaching the zenith of their influence on U.S. 
foreign policy with the invasion of Iraq, neo-conservatives appear 
to have fallen entirely out of favor, both within the administration 
of President George W Bush and in Baghdad itself. 
<p>
The signs of their defeat at the hands of both reality and the 
so-called ''realists'', who are headed within the administration by 
Secretary of State Colin Powell, are virtually everywhere but were 
probably best marked by the cover of 'Newsweek' magazine last 
week, which depicted the framed photograph of the neo-cons' 
favourite Iraqi, Ahmad Chalabi, which had been shattered during a 
joint police-U.S. military raid on his headquarters in Baghdad. 
'Bush's Mr. Wrong' was the title of the feature article. 
<p>
The victory of the realists, who also include the uniformed military 
and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), appeared complete 
Monday with the unveiling of the interim Iraqi government to which 
an as-yet undefined sovereignty is to be transferred from the 
U.S.-led occupation authorities Jun. 30. 
<p>
Not only was Chalabi's arch-rival-in-exile, Iyad Allawi, approved by 
the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) as prime minister, but neither 
Chalabi nor any of his closest IGC associates, especially Finance 
Minister Kamel al-Gailani -- who is accused of handing over much 
of Iraq's banking system to Chalabi during his tenure -- made it into 
the final line-up. 
<p>
''It looks like Chalabi is the big loser'', said one congressional aide 
who follows Iraq closely. ''And neo-con has become a dirty word up 
here'', he added, referring to the Congress, where Republicans 
have become increasingly restive as a result of recent debacles in 
Iraq, including the scandal over the abuse by U.S. soldiers of Iraqi 
detainees and leaks that Chalabi had been passing sensitive 
intelligence to Iran, and may have done so for years. 
<p>
''We need to restrain what are growing U.S. messianic instincts -- a 
sort of global social engineering where the United States feels it is 
both entitled and obligated to promote democracy -- by force if 
necessary'', said Senator Pat Roberts, a conservative Kansas 
member of Bush's Republican Party and chairman of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee, in a speech last week that was understood 
here as a direct shot at the neo-cons. 
<p>
The neo-conservatives, a key part of the coalition of hawks that 
dominated Bush's post-9/11 foreign policy, were the first to publicly 
call for Saddam Hussein's ouster, which they saw as a way to 
transform the Arab world to make it more hospitable to western 
values, U.S. interests and Israel's territorial ambitions. 
<p>
Since the latter part of the 1990s, when they led the charge in 
Congress for the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act (ILA), Chalabi and his 
Iraqi National Congress (INC) was their chosen instrument to 
achieve that transformation. 
<p>
While no neo-cons were appointed to cabinet-level positions 
under Bush, they obtained top posts in the offices of Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- where Paul Wolfowitz was named 
deputy Defense secretary and Douglas Feith under secretary for 
policy -- and Vice President Dick Cheney, whose chief of staff and 
national security adviser was I Lewis ''Scooter'' Libby. 
<p>
On the White House National Security Council staff, they were 
able to place former Iran-contra figure Elliott Abrams and Robert 
Joseph in key positions dealing with the Middle East and arms 
proliferation, respectively. 
<p>
Rumsfeld's Defense Policy Board (DPB) was dominated by 
neo-cons, notably its former chairman, Richard Perle, former CIA 
chief James Woolsey, former arms-control negotiator Kenneth 
Adelman and military historian Eliot Cohen. 
<p>
Neo-cons, more than any other group, pushed hardest for war in 
Iraq after 9/11 and predicted, backed up by Chalabi's assurances, 
that the conflict would be, among other things, a ''cakewalk'' and 
that U.S. troops would be greeted with ''flowers and sweets''. 
<p>
Within the administration, the neo-cons, again relying heavily on 
Chalabi's INC, developed their own intelligence analyses to 
bolster the notion of a link between former Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein and the al-Qaeda terrorist group, and exaggerated 
Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to provide 
a more credible pretext for war. 
<p>
Their friends on the DPB and in the media then stoked the public's 
fears about these threats through frequent appearances on 
television and a barrage of newspaper columns and magazine 
articles. 
<p>
While analysts and regional experts at the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) and the State Department, which had dropped 
Chalabi as a fraud and a con-man in the mid-1990s, tried to resist 
the juggernaut, they were consistently outflanked by the neo-cons, 
whose influence and ability to circumvent the professionals was 
greatly enhanced by their access to Rumsfeld and Cheney, who 
served as their champions in the White House and with Bush 
personally. 
<p>
Their influence reached its zenith in early April when Chalabi and 
700 of his paid INC troops were airlifted by the Pentagon to the 
southern city of Nasariyeh on Cheney's authority against Bush's 
stated policy that Washington would not favor one Iraqi faction 
over another. Bush's own national security adviser, Condoleezza 
Rice, professed surprise when informed of the move by reporters. 
<p>
While they were still riding high as U.S. troops consolidated their 
control of Iraq, the neo-cons' star began to wane already last 
August when it became clear that their and Chalabi's predictions 
about a grateful Iraqi populace were about as well-founded as 
their certainties about Hussein's ties to al-Qaeda and his WMD 
stockpiles. 
<p>
Sensing trouble ahead, Rice asked former ambassador to India, 
Robert Blackwill, to return to the White House, where he had been 
her boss during the presidency of George HW Bush, the current 
leader's father (1989-93). By October, she and he had formed an 
inter-agency Iraq Stabilization Group (ISG) that gradually wrested 
control of Iraq policy from the Pentagon. 
<p>
It was a process in which Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) 
chief Paul Bremer, who had come to detest Chalabi and his 
neo-con backers in Baghdad and Washington, was an 
enthusiastic participant and which was effectively completed with 
the announcement late last month that the State Department was 
taking over the 14 billion dollars in reconstruction money for Iraq 
that the Pentagon has not yet spent. 
<p>
In the last month, the neo-con retreat has turned into a rout, 
particularly as reports of Chalabi's cosiness with Iran gained 
currency and, just as important, senior military officers indicated 
that a military victory over the Iraqi insurgency was not possible. 
<p>
The public attention given to a blistering attack on the neo-cons by 
the former chief of the U.S. Central Command, Gen Anthony Zinni, 
on the popular television program, '60 Minutes', also 
demonstrated that the media, ever cautious about taking on 
powerful figures, now saw them as fair game. 
<p>
When Perle, Woolsey and several other neo-cons visited Rice at 
the White House on May 1 to protest the shoddy treatment Chalabi 
was receiving at the hands of the CIA, Bremer and the State 
Department, participants said she thanked them for their views and 
offered nothing more. Neither Rumsfeld nor Cheney nor any of 
their neo-con aides attended.
