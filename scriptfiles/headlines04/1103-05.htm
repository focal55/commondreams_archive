      <p>BUDAPEST, Hungary - Hungary will withdraw its 300 non-combat troops from 
        Iraq by March 31, the country's new prime minister said Wednesday, because 
        staying longer would be an "impossibility." 
      <p>
 "We are obliged to stay there until the (Iraqi) elections. To stay longer is an impossibility," Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany said at a ceremony to mark the end of mandatory military service in Hungary.
      <p> The former communist country, which joined the European Union in May, sent 
        the troops as part of the U.S.-led coalition, but the government has been 
        under mounting pressure from citizens and opposition parties who oppose 
        the soldiers' presence. 
      <p>
 The Iraqi elections are due to be held by Jan. 31.
 <p>
 The interim Iraqi government recently asked Hungary to maintain its troop presence for about another year.
 <p>
 In a letter sent to Hungary about three weeks ago, Iraq thanked the country for its contributions so far and asked that the troops' mission be extended by about a year "to help Iraq's stabilization process," government spokeswoman Boglar Laszlo told The Associated Press.
 <p>

 Hungary has a transportation contingent of 300 troops in Iraq stationed in Hillah, south of Baghdad. Parliament last year authorized the mission until Dec. 31.
 <p>
 One Hungarian soldier has died in Iraq, killed when a roadside bomb exploded by the water-carrying convoy he was guarding.
 <p>
 Gyurcsany, who was elected in September, said last month he did not believe in pre-emptive war.
 <p>
 Defense Minister Ferenc Juhasz had said the government would await the outcome of the U.S. presidential election before making a decision about Iraq.
