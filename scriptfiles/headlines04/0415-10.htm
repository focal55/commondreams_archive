WASHINGTON  - Americans living in nearly one in
five counties nationwide are breathing unhealthy air, according
to new ozone rules the Bush administration unveiled on
Thursday.

The Environmental Protection agency told officials in 31 states Thursday they must develop new pollution controls because the air in some of their counties, home to more than 150 million people, does not meet federal health standards.

The new standards are generally supported by environmental
groups, which have bitterly criticized President Bush's White
House for relaxing other pollution rules to benefit various
industries.
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency  said that 474 of the
nation's 2,700 counties in 31 states have unacceptable levels
of ground-level ozone, a major ingredient in smog, up from 221
under the previous guidelines. About 159 million Americans live
in counties that violate the new standards, the agency said.
 <p>
 Ozone is formed when fumes from automobiles, factories and
other fossil fuels react with sunlight. It is linked to human
respiratory problems including emphysema and bronchitis.
 <p>
 EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt said the agency notified
governors of the 31 states about the violations, which require
them to submit smog reduction plans in three years.
 <p>
 "This isn't about the air getting dirtier," Leavitt said.
"These new rules are about our new understanding of health
threats -- about our standards getting tougher and our national
resolve to meet them."
 <p>
 The agency set compliance deadlines based on the severity
of the smog. Areas with marginal to moderate pollution have
until 2007 to 2009, while highly polluted counties in
California get more time. EPA gave smog-ridden Los Angeles and
surrounding counties until June 2021 to comply.
 <p>
 The new ozone test stems from 1997 EPA rules delayed by
numerous court challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court  upheld the
rules in early 2001.
 <p>
 The new rules allow less ozone -- 85 parts per billion down
from 120 parts per billion -- and require more frequent tests.
 <p>
 HIGHER COSTS
 <p>
 Violating counties would have to spend more on pollution
controls such as requiring cleaner-burning gasoline and power
plants and more frequent automobile inspections.
 <p>
 The changes mean that about 100 metropolitan areas are in
violation of the standards for the first time. They include San
Francisco, Denver and many previously compliant suburban and
rural areas, the EPA said.
 <p>
 Large swaths of Southern California around Los Angeles and
the Northeast corridor between Washington and New York have
long been out of compliance.
 <p>
 Some 19 states pass the test, including large swaths of the
West around the Rocky Mountains along with Florida, Iowa,
Minnesota, Mississippi and Vermont.
 <p>
 Business leaders said the rules could cost states billions
of dollars and scare away new industry.
 <p>
 "A non-attainment designation could put a black mark on all
of these communities, reducing their business opportunities,
investment and competitiveness," said Jeffrey Marks at the
National Association of Manufacturers.
 <p>
 Environmental groups applauded the rules, but criticized
the flexibility given to some counties.
<p>
 "It's a positive step that the EPA is going to require
stronger anti-smog measures in areas that need them," said
Howard Fox, an attorney at Earthjustice. "But they didn't take
the next step, which is to set clear firm deadlines for
cleaning up those new areas."</p>
