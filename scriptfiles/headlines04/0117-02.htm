<p>TIKRIT, Iraq  - Guerrillas killed three U.S.  soldiers and two Iraqi officials on Saturday, taking the death  toll of U.S. soldiers in Iraq to 500 since the war to oust  Saddam Hussein began last March.
<p> 
			
							The mounting toll is a problem for President Bush in the  months before he seeks re-election in November but Washington  insisted it would hand over power in Iraq by mid-2004.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->The roadside bomb north of Baghdad appeared to be one of  the most powerful used against U.S. occupation forces to date  -- killing the five inside a Bradley armored vehicle, which  resembles a small tank. Previous attacks on U.S. convoys have  tended to cause casualties aboard lighter vehicles such as  trucks.<p> 
			
							After meeting Bush for talks on Friday, the U.S. governor  of Iraq, Paul Bremer, said Washington was willing to adjust  plans for handing over power to appease Iraq's top Shi'ite  cleric, but was unlikely to meet his key demand for elections  this year.<p> 
			
							Bremer also stressed the June 30 deadline for transferring  power to an Iraqi government would not be extended. Coalition  troops are, however, scheduled to stay under bilateral  agreements with the new government.<p> 
			
							He will meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday  and is expected to press him to send a U.N. team to Iraq to  convince Shi'ites that direct elections are not feasible or  suggest a workable compromise.<p> 
			
							In the latest attack, the roadside bomb near the town of  Taji, 30 km (19 miles) north of Baghdad, set the Bradley on  fire, killing five inside, said Lieutenant Colonel William  Macdonald of the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division.<p> 
			
							Three U.S. soldiers and two Iraqi civil defense officials  were killed and two U.S. soldiers were injured, he said. Troops  arrested three Iraqi men in a sweep of the area shortly after  when a truck they were traveling in was found to contain  bomb-making material.<p> 
			
							Taji was at the heart of Iraq's military-industrial complex  during Saddam's rule and lies in an area coalition forces call  the "Sunni triangle" -- dominated by members of Saddam's Sunni  community where opposition to the U.S. troops has been  fiercest.<p> 
			
							The U.S. military also said on Saturday an American soldier  died from a "non-hostile gunshot wound" on Friday.<p> 
			
							Confirmation of the four American deaths brought the death  toll to 500 since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq began on March  20 last year.<p> 
			
							At least 115 soldiers were killed in the invasion itself  and some 231 have been killed in hostilities since then. A  further 154 have died in accidents or suicides, including the  U.S. soldier who died on Friday.<p> 
			
							JAPANESE TROOPS<p> 
			
							Meanwhile, Japanese troops arrived in Kuwait on Saturday  ahead of a humanitarian mission in Iraq in the country's most  controversial military deployment since World War II.<p> 
			
							The troops move into Iraq next week and any casualties  could rock Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's government.<p> 
			
							"Our mission is to support the Iraqi people by conducting  water purification and water supply and medical support and  construction," said the commanding officer of the 35-strong  Japanese team, Colonel Nasahisa Sato.<p> 
			
							He declined to give any details on Japanese troop movements  or the size of the overall mission.<p> 
			
							In Berlin, NATO's new secretary-general said the alliance  could play a greater role in bringing stability to Iraq but its  priority remained its peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan.<p> 
			
							The comments by Jaap de Hoop Scheffer come amid signs that  Germany and France -- which both saw a sharp deterioration in  relations with Washington over their opposition to the war in  Iraq -- may not stand in the way of expanding NATO's role  there.<p> 
			
							In Washington, Bremer expressed "doubts" about Shi'ite  demands for elections before the transfer of power, but said:  "These are questions that, obviously, need to be looked at."<p> 
			
							He said Washington may alter the way a transitional Iraqi  assembly is selected and make other "clarifications," but gave  few details.<p> 
			
							Bremer's comments were unlikely to impress Ayatollah Ali  al-Sistani, one of the most revered men in Iraq, who has  demanded that the transitional assembly be elected, instead of  chosen by regional caucuses under current U.S. plans.<p> 
			
							Aides have said he could issue a fatwa, or edict, banning  his followers from cooperating with the U.S. authority in Iraq  if his demands were not met.<p>
