LONDON - British protesters wearing black hoods  like those worn by Iraqi victims of abuse by U.S. soldiers  demonstrated against former U.S. President George Bush at a  fundraising event for his son's re-election campaign Tuesday.

Around 150 people picketed outside a London hotel where  Bush senior was guest of honor at a dinner costing at least  $1,000 to attend, raising funds for President Bush and Vice  President Dick Cheney's November election bid.<p> 
			
			"I'm here to stand up against death and destruction around  the world," said one of the hooded protesters, Ingrid Dodd, a  medical doctor from Dover.<p> 
			
			"I spend all day trying to clean people up and then I see  our bombs on television tearing them apart."<p> 
			
			The protesters' hoods looked like those once used by the  U.S. military on prisoners in Iraq. They were banned two weeks  ago by the U.S. general charged with reforming Iraq's military  jails after prisoner abuse photos were seen around the world.<p> 
			
			More than 300 police surrounded the hotel and protesters  stood in a police pen away from the entrance where they waved  anti-war banners. Police said one protester was arrested.<p> 
			
			The international arm of the U.S. Republican party,  Republicans Abroad, hosted the event and many of those  attending were keen to voice their support for the president,  despite the protest.<p> 
			
			"I support Bush because he's doing the right thing in  Iraq," said one guest, Alex Kulpecz, an oil and gas consultant  who has lived in London for 20 years.<p> 
			
			"The jury's still out on whether Bush senior or Bush junior  is the better president."
