<p>GENEVA - The International Committee of the Red  Cross (ICRC) said Thursday it had repeatedly urged the United  States to take "corrective action" at a Baghdad jail at the  center of a scandal over abuse of Iraqi prisoners.

The Geneva-based humanitarian agency, mandated under  international treaties to visit detainees, has had regular  access to Abu Ghraib prison since U.S.-led forces began using  it last year, according to chief spokeswoman Antonella Notari.<p> 
			
			"The ICRC, aware of the situation, and based on its  findings, has repeatedly asked the U.S. authorities to take  corrective action," she told Reuters.<p> 
			
			Notari declined to give details of what the ICRC had seen  during the visits, which take place every five to six weeks, or  about its reports to the U.S. authorities.<p> 
			
			The United Nations said separately that it had written to  U.S. authorities, including Secretary of State Colin Powell and  Governor of Iraq Paul Bremer, seeking information on human  rights in Iraq over the past year, including treatment of  detainees.<p> 
			
			The Iraqi Governing Council and foreign ministers of other  members of the U.S.-led coalition had also been asked to  provide information.<p> 
			
			The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights  said in a statement its team was ready to visit Baghdad for  talks with coalition and Iraqi leaders, before submitting a  report on May 31. The inquiry is being led by Jakob Moller, a  lawyer and human rights expert.<p> 
			
			The ICRC, which has been operating since the late 19th  century, keeps a public silence about what it hears from  detainees as the price for gaining access to jails in trouble  spots around the world from Chechnya to West Africa.<p> 
			
			Pictures of grinning U.S. soldiers abusing naked Iraqis at  Abu Ghraib, Iraq's largest prison and notorious under Saddam  Hussein for torture, have sparked an international outcry.<p> 
			
			In a bid to limit damage to the U.S. image, President Bush  went on two Arabic satellite television stations on Wednesday  to tell an outraged Middle East that soldiers guilty of abusing  Iraqi prisoners would be punished.<p> 
			
			WANTON CRIMINAL ABUSES<p> 
			
			Bush aides said the president had upbraided Defense  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for not having alerted him to the  severity of the abuse at the jail, which was also the focus of  a separate earlier probe by a U.S. general.<p> 
			
			That report by Major-General Antonio Taguba, covering the  period October-December 2003 and completed on March 3, cited  incidents of "sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses."<p> 
			
			The ICRC has also visited thousands of prisoners under the  control of U.S. and British forces, which are also being  investigated after a British newspaper published pictures of a  soldier apparently urinating on an Iraqi detainee.<p> 
			
			But Notari declined to comment on what officials had seen  in British-run jails.<p> 
			
			Under the Geneva Conventions on both prisoners and the  treatment of civilians in wartime, the ICRC must be allowed to  interview detainees in private and on a regular basis.<p> 
			
			On these terms, it has carried out two visits to Saddam,  who is being held somewhere in Iraq since his capture by U.S.  troops shortly before Christmas.<p> 
			
			"It is important that people understand our role, which is  to be present and to have a dialogue with the authorities,"  Notari said.<p> 
			
			But on a few occasions the Red Cross has broken its vow of  silence because either the authority concerned has issued a  partial account of the ICRC's findings or has simply failed to  take any action after a long period.<p> 
			
			One such example involved Israeli treatment of detained  Palestinians some 20 years ago, when the ICRC went public with  its criticism, Notari said.<p> 
			
			More recently, the ICRC has expressed mounting frustration  over the situation of Afghan and other detainees at the U.S.  naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, announcing that its  concerns about conditions and treatment were not being  addressed.
