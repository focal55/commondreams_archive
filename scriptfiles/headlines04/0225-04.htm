<p>San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom came out roaring against what he 
termed President Bush's shameful call Tuesday for a constitutional amendment 
to ban same-sex marriage and challenged fellow Democrats to stand firm against 
the proposal.
<P>The president has "tried to divide this country in order to advance his 
political career by messing with the Constitution,'' Newsom said at a City 
Hall press conference after Bush's comments from the White House.

      SHAMEFUL<br>

<!--/endimage/-->"It's fundamentally wrong on principle, and we've got to have the courage 
to stand up and say enough, stop. And that's what we're doing here in San 
Francisco, and that's what I hope Democrats across this country will do as 
well,'' he said.
<P>Newsom's decision two weeks ago authorizing city officials to  issue 
marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples reignited the national debate 
over the volatile issue that raises social, political, legal and religious 
questions. Since the first same-sex couple married in the city on Feb. 12, 
nearly 3,300 more followed and hundreds more are waiting their turn as the 
legal battles play out.
<P>The mayor said he was acting to uphold the equal protection rights 
guaranteed by the California Constitution.
<P>He said the presidential push for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
must be rebuffed. 
<P>"I can't believe people of good conscience, from any ideological 
perspective, can honestly say that the Constitution should be used to take 
rights away from people when the Constitution was conceived to advance the 
rights of people in this country,'' said San Francisco's 36-year-old 
Democratic mayor. "It is a terrible day because of what the president of the 
United States has decided to do to divide the United States of America. That, 
I think, is shameful.''
<P>Newsom's position is shared by most other officeholders representing San 
Francisco, one of the most liberal cities in the United States.
<P>"We're witnessing a historic moment of change in American life,'' said 
Carole Migden, a former assemblywoman who chairs the state Board of 
Equalization. "President Bush is choosing to cater to his far-right 
conservative base instead of liberating a massive group of people who've 
suffered from discrimination.''
<P>Some same-sex supporters responded to Bush's decision by quickly 
organizing a rally in the early evening at Castro and Market streets.
<P>About 200 people showed up, waving signs that declared, "We deserve the 
freedom to marry,'' and cheering speakers who rebutted the religious, 
political and legal arguments against same-sex marriage.
<P>"The Constitution has ... been amended ... usually to expand people's 
rights," Bob Kearny, assistant director for the ACLU of Northern California, 
said to the crowd at Harvey Milk Plaza. "Only one time has it been amended to 
limit rights  --  Prohibition  --  and you can see how well that turned out."
<P>Kearny waved a bound copy of the Constitution and denounced the possible 
amendment. "It is unprecedented. It is unnecessary. It is wrong," he said.
<P>As the crowd cheered and drive-by supporters honked horns, a woman sat 
quietly on top of a newspaper stand with a hand-made message for Bush and 
supporters of a constitutional amendment that would bar same-sex marriage: 
"Amend Your Mind."
<P>San Franciscan Joe Pawlicki, 41, said supporters of Bush's amendment were 
hypocritical to oppose a Massachusetts court decision in favor of same-sex 
marriages. He held a sign stating, "Activist Judges' empowered Bush," 
referring to the court decision on the 2000 presidential election.
<P>"The court system is in this country to protect the minority," Pawlicki 
said. An amendment against same-sex marriages "will enshrine discrimination 
into the most respected document in this country."
<P>Many speakers compared the fight for same-sex marriages to the civil 
rights movement and the overthrow of state laws that once banned interracial 
marriages. Molly McKay, executive director of Marriage Equality California, 
said she was not discouraged by polls that showed a vast majority of Americans 
oppose same-sex marriages.
<P>"If government had acted then as if civil rights were something that can 
be subject to popular vote, we would not have the freedoms we have now," McKay 
told the applauding crowd. "We need the courts to protect us from the vote of 
the majority."
<P>Earlier in the day, San Franciscan Celia Sack, 34, who was in City Hall 
to marry Paula Harris, 46,  said that as an American she was saddened by the 
president's resolve to deny her the right to marry.
<P>She noted that the battles to integrate schools and give women the right 
to vote were not resolved quickly or easily.
<P>"I think this is something that 20 years down the line a lot of 
politicians are going to be ashamed for the stance they took,'' said Sack. 
<P>Newsom has had few prominent Democrats support his rebellious act to defy 
a state statute that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. 
The mayor suggested that Bush would have pushed for a constitutional amendment 
regardless of San Francisco's action. 
<P>Newsom noted that Bush hinted at his coming position in his State of the 
Union address last month, and numerous news accounts reported that the White 
House leaked word to conservative supporters prior to the first same-sex 
wedding at San Francisco City Hall.
<P>San Francisco Archbishop William Levada, one of the most vocal critics of 
Newsom's edict to sanction same-sex marriage, applauded the president, echoing 
the position of the Catholic Bishops of the United States.
<P>"Only a constitutional amendment can now assure that marriage between a 
woman and a man, and the family they raise, can remain into the future a 
foundational element of our society,'' Levada said.
<P>The president's resolve to change the Constitution put the San Francisco 
Republican Party in a difficult position. Local GOP Chairman Mike DeNunzio 
said, "President Bush is the leader of the Republican Party and we're not 
going to oppose him.''
<P>But when pressed on whether the local chapter supports a constitutional 
prohibition on gay and lesbian nuptials, DeNunzio said his group doesn't want 
to take a position on an issue of national significance, but instead focus on 
such areas as improving the city's economy.
<p>
  <b>What the polls say
  </b>
<P>Recent polls have examined how the public feels about homosexuality, same-
sex marriage, civil unions and efforts to ban same-sex marriage. Among their 
findings:
<P>
<ul>
    <li>Americans are closely divided on whether homosexual relations between 
  adults should or should not be legal.<br>
  </li>
    <li>A majority of Americans, sometimes by as much as a 2-1 ratio, say 
  they oppose legalizing same-sex marriage.<br>
  </li>
    <li>Americans are divided on whether homosexual couples should be allowed 
  to form legally recognized civil unions, with slightly more people opposing it.<br>
  </li>
    <li>People are evenly divided on the question of a constitutional 
  amendment banning same-sex marriage  --  an attitude that has shifted in the 
  last month from majority opposition.</li>
</ul>
<P>A month ago, when people were given the option of a constitutional 
amendment banning same-sex marriage or letting states make their own laws, 
almost 6 in 10 favored letting states deal with the issue, while almost 4 in 
10 favored a constitutional amendment. 
<P>The results on homosexual relations come from a January CNN-USA Today-
Gallup poll, the results on same-sex marriage come from several recent polls, 
and the results on civil unions and a constitutional amendment banning same-
sex marriage come from an ABC News-Washington Post poll out in January.</p>
