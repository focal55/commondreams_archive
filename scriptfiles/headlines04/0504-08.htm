WASHINGTON - U.S. soldiers accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners were following orders and are being used as scapegoats to protect their superiors, the wife of one of the soldiers and the lawyer for another said on Tuesday. 

<p>

 Martha Frederick defended her husband, a soldier who faces

prosecution for the abuse of Iraqis at the Abu Ghraib prison

near Baghdad.

 <p>

 "He was told to do these things and when he did them he

thought that he was doing them in the sense of national

security," Frederick said.

 <p>

 The U.S. military has brought charges of assault, cruelty

and maltreatment against six soldiers, members of a military

police battalion.

 <p>

 It has also reprimanded six officers in connection with

abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison after photographs were

broadcast around the world showing naked Iraqi prisoners

stacked in a pyramid or positioned to simulate sex acts.

 <p>

 In e-mails to his wife, Staff Sgt. Ivan Frederick

questioned some of the abuses he witnessed, such as leaving

inmates naked in their cells or making them wear female

underwear and handcuffing them to the doors of their cells.

 <p>

 "He questioned it from my understanding and he even tried

to come up with some rules knowing that pretty much this was

something he did not normally do," said his wife in an

interview on NBC's "Today" show.

 <p>

 She complained her husband was being thrust into the

limelight while others were protected. "Those who are

responsible are standing behind the curtain and watching him

take the fall for it. It's almost like being a pawn in a chess

game," she said.

 <p>

 'STAGED PICTURES'

 <p>

 Houston lawyer Guy Womack, who is representing reservist

Charles Graner in the abuse case, said his client should not be

court-martialed and that pictures taken of him abusing Iraqi

prisoners were staged.

 <p>

 "You court-martial the right person. You don't

court-martial the soldier who is following orders. He was under

the command and the direction of intelligence officers, both

military and civilian," Womack told NBC's "Today" show.

 <p>

 Graner, who was a corrections officer at a North Carolina

prison, was on duty in Iraq  for a military police unit.

 <p>

 Womack said the pictures were staged and part of the

psychological manipulation of prisoners, adding that his client

was told to smile for the camera along with a female soldier

who was pointing at a prisoner's genitals.

 <p>

 "These pictures themselves are abhorrent, but you have to

put them in context," Womack said.

 <p>

 Reserve Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, who oversaw prison

facilities in Iraq, said she took responsibility for some of

what had happened but pointed out military intelligence was in

charge of interrogations -- not the military police under her

command.

 <p>

 Her lawyer, Neal Puckett, told CNN, "What's clear in all of

this and what's apparently yet to be investigated is that the

military intelligence personnel were the folks that had

complete, exclusive control over what went on in the

interrogation rooms."

 <p>

 Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman called for a congressional

investigation into the abuse and asked when U.S. military

leaders had become aware of what was going on at the prison.

 <p>

 "Clearly we need to know what the secretary of defense knew

at what point and what he did about it; the same with the head

of the Joint Chiefs; the same with the president. We need to

know what was the response of our government to this horrendous

set of facts once they got them," said the New Mexico senator.
