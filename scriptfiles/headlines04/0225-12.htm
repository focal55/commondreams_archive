<p>WASHINGTON   - The system created by the United  States for trials by military tribunal of foreign terrorism  suspects held at Guantanamo Bay is fundamentally unfair and  hopelessly antiquated, military lawyers assigned to represent  these prisoners said on Wednesday.
<p> 
			
			"We are concerned with virtually every aspect of the  military commission process and the impact that will have on  our client's chances to get a fair trial," Navy Lt. Cdr. Philip  Sundel told Reuters.<p> 
			
			Sundel and Army Maj. Mark Bridges were assigned by the  Pentagon on Feb. 6 to represent Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al  Bahlul of Yemen.<p> 
			
			The United States on Tuesday brought charges for the first  time against prisoners at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo  Bay, Cuba, charging al Bahlul and Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi  of Sudan with conspiracy to commit war crimes. The Pentagon  said they face trial by tribunals of military officers,  formally called commissions.<p> 
			
			The Pentagon identified al Bahlul as an al Qaeda  "propagandist" and former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden.<p> 
			
			Army Maj. Mark Bridges said he and Sundel plan a defense  case that not only challenges evidence presented against al  Bahlul, but attacks the foundation of the tribunal process.<p> 
			
			"We do envision raising a lot of motions related to the  rules and the procedures themselves," Bridges said in an  interview.<p> 
			
			But he doubted these motions will not get a fair hearing  because the rules do not permit a truly independent review. He  said the same Pentagon official who approved the charges  against his client also may rule on these types of motions.<p> 
			
			The tribunals will mark the first such U.S. trials since  World War II.<p> 
			
			'OUTDATED SYSTEM'<p> 
			
			"The bottom line is it's an outdated system that was pulled  off the shelf and dusted off from the World War II era. The law  has advanced a lot since then, both internationally and  domestically. The standards that were applied then simply  aren't acceptable today," Bridges said.<p> 
			
			He said he and Sundel have not been given a chance to meet  their client yet, and do not know whether al Bahlul has been  informed of the charges. Bridges also said he has not seen any  prosecution evidence in the case.<p> 
			
			"The checks and balances that we expect from a system today  to make sure that the process is fair and that it is not  subjected to improper influences by any of the participants  don't exist in the military commission system," said Sundel.<p> 
			
			President Bush in November 2001 authorized military  tribunal trials for non-U.S. citizens caught in what he calls  the global war on terrorism. Human rights groups and legal  activists have said the rules for the tribunals are rigged to  yield convictions and handicap defense counsel.<p> 
			
			"I think military commissions provide a full and fair  process," said Maj. John Smith, a lawyer and spokesman for the  Pentagon's office of military tribunals.<p> 
			
			"We have the presumption of innocence. We have the highest  burden of proof in criminal court -- proof of guilt beyond a  reasonable doubt. We have representation by zealous defense  counsel. They have the ability to present evidence and call  witnesses."<p> 
			
			Marine Corps Maj. Michael Mori, who represents Australian  Guantanamo prisoner David Hicks, echoed the criticism. Hicks,  one of four Guantanamo prisoners given lawyers, has not yet  been charged.<p> 
			
			"When you use an unfair system, all you do is risk  convicting the innocent and providing somebody who's truly  guilty with a valid complaint to attack his conviction. It  doesn't help anybody. It only helps the people who created the  system to predict the outcome," Mori said.<p>
