Critics had called for him to quit after the furor over the  abuse of Iraqi prisoners but analysts, editors and ordinary  Arabs were united in their condemnation of Bush who said the  United States owed Rumsfeld a "debt of gratitude."<p> 
			
			"After the torture and vile acts by the American army,  President Bush goes out and congratulates Rumsfeld. It's just  incredible. I am in total shock," said Omar Belhouchet, editor  of the influential Algerian national daily El Watan.<p> 
			
			"Bush's praise for Rumsfeld will discredit the United  States...and further damage its reputation, which is already at  a historic low in the Arab world," he added.<p> 
			
			Analysts have said the damage from images seen worldwide of  U.S. soldiers abusing naked Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib  prison would be indelible, incalculable and a gift to al Qaeda  leader Osama bin Laden.<p> 
			
			What people saw, they said, was the true image of the  occupation: humiliation of an occupied people, contempt for  Islam, sadism and racism.<p> 
			
			"After Mr. Bush's decision to keep Rumsfeld, all their  apologies seem like lip service," Dubai-based political analyst  Jawad al-Anani told Reuters. "Mr. Rumsfeld would have certainly  lost his job if the prisoners were American."<p> 
			
			"The United States is spending so much money by setting up  Alhurra television and Radio Sawa to improve its image in the  Arab world...How can it reconcile that with keeping a man who  has insulted every Arab through the abuses of Iraqi prisoners,"  added Anani, a former Jordanian foreign minister.<p> 
			
			University of Algiers professor Mahmoud Belhimeur agreed.<p> 
			
			"I cannot believe the United States reacts the way an  authoritarian regimes would. Bush should have done the  honorable thing and fired Rumsfeld," he said.<p> 
			
			RUMSFELD "SYMBOL" OF IRAQ WAR<p> 
			
			But Michael Cox, professor of international relations at  the London School of Economics, said the repercussions of  firing the defense secretary would have been very significant  for Bush.<p> 
			
			"This has been Rumsfeld's war, and I suppose the political  symbolism of trying to get rid of Rumsfeld would be huge."<p> 
			
			Cox said he could not entirely rule out that Rumsfeld could  go, if U.S. public opinion turned. But he added it would seem  out of character for Rumsfeld to go quietly.<p> 
			
			"'I want to spend more time with my family' doesn't sound  too credible with Mr. Rumsfeld. With Mr. Powell maybe, but not  Rumsfeld," he said.<p> 
			
			A Saudi businessman, who asked not to be named, said  keeping Rusmfeld would be seen as Washington's quiet approval  of the abuse.<p> 
			
			"This just confirms that what is happening in Iraq in  general, and especially what is happening in Abu Ghraib is  sanctioned by the American administration and that is a hell of  a position to be in.<p> 
			
			"I see no advantage in keeping Rumsfeld. Bush should be  building bridges with the outside world."<p> 
			
			Mustapha Ramid, a prominent Moroccan opposition member of  parliament said: "It's normal for Bush to back Rumsfeld. The  contrary would have been a real surprise. This shows that Bush  takes responsibility for what's happening in Iraq."<p>
