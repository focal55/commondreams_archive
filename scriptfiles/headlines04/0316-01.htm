<p> Within hours of Thursday's fateful Madrid blasts the 
                        United Nations Security Council met. During a five minute 
                        session the council's 15 members unanimously adopted 
                        a resolution condemning the Basque separatist group 
                        ETA for the deadly attacks. But as it became increasingly 
                        clear that ETA was not responsible, questions 
                        of attempted manipulation of the public were 
                        abundant. 
<p>Spain's ruling Popular Party went down 
                        in defeat to the Socialists in Sunday's national 
                        election. It did so amid accusations that the government 
                        had withheld information on the bombings in an effort to 
                        influence the forthcoming vote. 
<p>A tough line on 
                        ETA had long been part of the Popular Party's platform. 
                        If indeed such a horrific ETA attack occurred, it would 
                        be certain to win Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's 
                        chosen successor the prime ministership. But with the 
                        Iraq war strongly unpopular among Spaniards, Islamic 
                        jihadi involvement in Thursday's nightmare would have 
                        grave implications for the Popular Party's votes, and it 
                        indeed did. 
<p>Despite doubts among experts in many 
                        corners, the Spanish government's reaction to Thursday's 
                        tragedy was immediate. Spain's interior minister, Angel 
                        Acebes, demanded that there was "no doubt" with regard 
                        to ETA's responsibility. But while Spanish passions 
                        could well be expected to influence judgement, what of 
                        the 14 remaining members of the Security Council? And 
                        notably, this was the first instance of a terrorist 
                        attack where any group was ever explicitly condemned by 
                        the council, let alone done so in five minutes. 
                        
<p>Explaining how ETA came to be blamed, the 
                        council's French president, Ambassador Jean-Marc de la 
                        Sabliere, said: "The Spanish government stated that, and 
                        the Spanish delegation has asked the council to put this 
                        element in their resolution and members of the council 
                        accepted it." The US ambassador to the United Nation, 
                        John Negroponte, explained that blame was assigned to 
                        ETA at the Spanish government's urging, and because "it 
                        is the judgement of the government of Spain that these 
                        attacks were carried out by ETA and we have no 
                        information to the contrary". 
<p>Though repeated 
                        questions were raised in many quarters, and the head of 
                        Europol, Juergen Storbeck, had voiced reservations 
                        regarding ETA's involvement, the Security Council 
                        nevertheless chose to condemn ETA. But the fact that 
                        council members such as the US and France chose to 
                        portray their action based upon the Spanish government's 
                        wishes, illustrated a concurrent distancing from the 
                        decision. The council's actions were appreciated as 
                        questionable from their outset. 
<p>On Saturday, as 
                        Spanish protesters accused their government of 
                        attempting to promote the theory of ETA's responsibility 
                        for its political advantage, Acebes repeatedly insisted 
                        that ETA was the prime suspect. But on Thursday, the 
                        Spanish police had already found a van containing 
                        detonators and a tape of Koranic verses, ETA had issued 
                        a rare denial of responsibility and concurrently blamed 
                        "an operation of the Arab resistance" and an al-Qaeda 
                        related group had claimed the act as their own. 
                        Something else was uncovered as well. 
<p>In 
                        Thursday's alleged al-Qaeda letter claiming 
                        responsibility, the group Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades 
                        taunted Aznar and the coalition forces, saying: "Aznar, 
                        where is America? Who will protect you, Britain, Japan, 
                        Italy and others from us?" The specter of the "war on 
                        terrorism" bringing the terrorism increases that had 
                        been warned of by Western intelligence services became 
                        suddenly real. And the vulnerability of the Iraq 
                        Coalition's democratic governments to be voted from 
                        office - many of these governments supporting the war in 
                        spite of substantive popular protest - became a reality 
                        too. 
<p> The Spanish government is the first 
                        of those in this category to fall, in spite of the 
                        Security Council's action which might have given&nbsp;it the 
                        legitimacy to continue. And efforts were made to 
                        maintain that legitimacy, to cite ETA as potentially 
                        involved - both within Spain and abroad - through 
                        Sunday's election. 
<p>A Sunday Reuters article 
                        reported that: "Some Spaniards were vitriolic in 
                        accusing Aznar of 'manipulating' public opinion over the 
                        bombings." And on Sunday's national US television, 
                        Secretary of State Colin Powell, Defense Secretary 
                        Donald Rumsfeld and National Security Adviser 
                        Condoleezza Rice all insisted that there was 
                        insufficient information to know who was responsible for 
                        the Madrid attacks. But this was long after Thursday's 
                        Security Council resolution naming ETA, and with an 
                        apparent election debacle facing Spain's war supporters 
                        that very day. 
<p>Notably, the Bush administration 
                        has claimed al-Qaeda activity at every opportunity. 
                        Their failure to do so here, and in the face of 
                        substantive evidence of Islamic jihadi activity, being 
                        the one curious exception. 
<p>Highlighting another 
                        agenda, all three US officials argued that the Madrid 
                        attacks should firm world resolve in the "war on 
                        terror", with Rice insisting the war was being won. 
                        Their television appearances could be described as 
                        containing elements of a "pep talk". But as the new 
                        Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, 
                        has just said that he will recall Spain's 1,300 Iraqi 
                        peacekeeping troops by June 30, the rationale behind a 
                        broad effort to preserve and promote war on terror 
                        support becomes more apparent. 
<p>In a statement 
                        laden with paradox, Rumsfeld likened the coalition 
                        efforts to helping "the neighborhood children against 
                        the bully". But the secretary appears to have blithely 
                        forgotten the accusations by many UN members of Bush 
                        administration bullying in the run-up to the Iraq War. 
                        
<p>Much to his credit, UN Secretary General Kofi 
                        Annan repeatedly avoided media queries as regards 
                        responsibility for Madrid, but simultaneously 
                        demonstrated the UN's weakness in the face of big-power 
                        politics. Notably, it was the fate of the UN's 
                        predecessor, the League of Nations, to fall during the 
                        1930's as the world's major powers of the time chose to 
                        pursue paths of national expediency rather than 
                        multilateral interest. 
<p>A 1999 report by the US 
                        Department of Defense emphasized that the existence of a 
                        multilateral world, a multipolar world, was the best way 
                        to ensure lasting global stability. But it warned that: 
                        "International systems tend to last two to three 
                        generations. They are both created and destroyed by 
                        large-scale conflict. Like complex biological systems, 
                        international systems appear to go through life cycles 
                        with birth, flexibility in youth, more rigidity as the 
                        system matures, and demise." 
<p>Many international 
                        diplomats have recently called for the UN's "revision 
                        and renewal", and particularly a revised design for the 
                        Security Council.
