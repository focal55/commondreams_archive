<!--/endimage/--><p>TAIPEI  - Thousands of protesters marched through  Taiwan's capital on Saturday, urging the government to scrap a  big U.S. weapons package they said would trigger an arms race  with China and squeeze social welfare.
<P>

Defending the T$610.8 billion ($18.2 billion) deal, Premier  Yu Shyi-kun said maintaining strong defense and a military  balance with the island's arch-foe were critical to security.
<P>
"If you attack me with 100 missiles, I will at least attack  you with 50. If you attack Taipei and Kaohsiung, I will attack  Shanghai," Yu said in a speech before the protest.
<P>
"If we have such counter-strike capability today, Taiwan is  safe," he said in comments broadcast on cable news networks.
<P>
The weapons package is made up of $4.3 billion for Patriot  Advanced-Capability 3 missile defenses, $12.3 billion for eight  diesel-electric submarines and $1.6 billion for 12 P-3C Orion  submarine-hunting aircraft.
<P>
China has viewed self-governing Taiwan as a breakaway  province since a bloody civil war in 1949 and has threatened to  attack if the island declares formal independence.
<P>
Many security analysts see the Taiwan Strait as the most  dangerous flashpoint in Asia.
<P>
Protesters disagreed with Yu's comments.
<P>
"President Chen Shui-bian only likes to please the United  States to protect his presidency. He wants to die, but we will  not follow him," said a retired soldier, surnamed Chang.
<P>
A 40-year-old housewife surnamed Lin, said: "We don't want  any war, especially since both sides are Chinese."
<P>
Holding banners reading "Our money, Your war," "Want peace,  No war," the protesters ranging from veterans to unemployed  workers and children, joined the march to the presidential  palace.
<P>&nbsp;Some protesters brought with them bubble tea that became a  symbol of anti-arms purchases after the defense ministry issued  pamphlets saying Taiwan could afford the weapons if its 23  million people each drank one less bubble tea a week.
<P>

The milky drink containing small balls of glutinous sago is  a Taiwan specialty.
<P>
The arms package has come under growing criticism, with  opponents charging that the weapons are too costly or take too  long to deploy to be an effective defense.
<P>
Opposition parties, which hold a slim majority in  parliament, said the island could not afford the weapons and  the money should be spent on social welfare or education.
<P>
If approved by parliament, the weapons deal -- first  offered by President Bush three years ago -- would be the  biggest in a decade.
<P>
The military says the package will help Taiwan maintain a  balance of military power with China for another 30 years, but  if it falls through, China will have the capability to attack  the island in the next 2 to 3 years.
<P>
President Chen said earlier this week China has 610  missiles pointed at Taiwan and was increasing its arsenal by 50  to 70 missiles every year. Last December, Chen said China had  496 missiles facing Taiwan.
