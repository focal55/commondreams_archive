     PORT-AU-PRINCE -- Thousands of demonstrators chanting anti-American slogans encircled the US Marine-occupied National Palace here yesterday, lambasting the US government for &quot;kidnapping&quot; exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and demanding that their deposed leader be returned to power.</p>
<p>
     &quot;Viva Aristide! Down with America!&quot; and &quot;Down with Bush!&quot; shouted protesters, who marched to Aristide's former office from the slum neighborhood of Cite Soleil, a stronghold of his loyalists.</p>
<p>
     The demonstrators also swarmed in front of the US and French embassies, venting their anger at the two governments.</p>
<p>
     Aristide supporters have been growing bolder and more visible in recent days, after retreating from the streets after Aristide's clandestine departure last Sunday morning.</p>
<p>
     Yesterday's demonstration marked a change in Aristide supporters' rhetoric, which was as much anti-American and anti-French as it was pro-Aristide. US Marines at the palace looked edgy and kept their guns at the ready, but did not engage the protesters, many of whom yelled expletives at the soldiers inside the grounds. Some of the demonstrators wore guns or carried machetes, but the spirited protest remained peaceful, and protesters did not appear to threaten the US soldiers guarding the palace.</p>
<p>
     &quot;Bush stole two elections, one with [Al] Gore, and then from Haiti,&quot; said Philippe Paul, as he walked around the perimeter of the palace. Of Aristide, he said, &quot;They kidnapped him, like a thief.&quot;</p>
<p>
     More than 1,600 international troops are in Haiti to keep peace in the troubled nation since Aristide, under tremendous pressure from the United States and an internal threat from armed rebels, left the country last Sunday. American soldiers are guarding key sites, while French, American, and Chilean troops have joined Haitian police on a few foot patrols.</p>
<p>
     Locals have given the troops mixed responses, with some hoping the international presence will help impoverished Haiti, and others worrying that the peace-keeping effort will evolve into a long-term occupation that will deny Haiti self-rule and a genuine democracy.</p>
<p>
     The current operation marks the third time in 90 years that US troops have come to Haiti, and Aristide loyalists say they feel betrayed that the United States -- which reinstalled Aristide as president ten years ago after he was ousted by Haiti's military -- is now here to preside over the post-Aristide transition.</p>
<p>
     &quot;From coup d'etat to coup d'etat. That is the history of Haiti,&quot; said Ernst Ajax, 65.</p>
<p>
     &quot;If Aristide does not come back, Haiti will be a state of America,&quot; said Jean-Paul LaPlante, another protester.</p>
<p>
     US officials downplayed yesterday's demonstration, and noted that American troops have not used force against Haitian nationals. &quot;There are peaceful, democratic protests throughout the city,&quot; General James T. &quot;Tom&quot; Hill told reporters at the US command post at the airport.</p>
<p>
     He said US Marines were put at the palace because of a concern that it would be ransacked, looted and taken over; spokesman Major Richard Crusan said the military hoped Haitian police would eventually take over the visible task of guarding the building.</p>
<p>
     James B. Foley, the US ambassador to Haiti, said Americans needed to be careful because &quot;there's a lot of lawlessness,&quot; but he said he didn't think there was an enhanced threat to US citizens and troops in the country.</p>
<p>
     The capital is gradually returning to normal, with heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic clogging the winding streets. Shops and banks have begun reopening, and residents began cleaning the garbage-strewn streets. Ednar Nonez, a Haitian police precinct commissioner, said his officers had recovered seven stolen police vehicles.</p>
<p>
     Troops from the United States, Canada, France, and Chile cruised around the capital and conducted a foot patrol in the city's center.</p>
<p>
     So far, there have been no confrontations between US troops and Haitian citizens, and while many locals are suspicious of or opposed to the US presence, the American soldiers have not been targets of physical attacks.</p>
<p>
     Hill said he had also sent US Special Forces to patrol in other parts of the country, including Cap-Haitien, the home of Guy Philippe, leader of the rebels whose march toward the capital helped spur Aristide's flight, and Gonaives, where the insurgency began on Feb. 5.</p>
<p>
     The creation of the new government sputtered ahead with the selection yesterday of a seven-member Council of Sages that will propose a new prime minister for Haiti. The current prime minister, Yvon Neptune, was part of Aristide's government.</p>
<p>
     Still, there were signals of lingering unrest that kept the capital in a government-ordered state of emergency. While Philippe agreed this week to lay down his arms, he has not yet done so, Hill said, and US military officials believed Philippe was still in Port-au-Prince yesterday.</p>
<p>
     Aristide remains in exile in the Central African Republic. In Cite Soleil, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, locals continued to insist that Aristide was forced out of the country by outside governments. Aristide has insisted that he was kidnapped, a charge firmly denied by the United States.</p>
<p>
     Pro-Aristide Haitians said they would continue to demonstrate until they got their president back, and some said the response may be violent if their demand is denied. Others pledged to boycott new elections.</p>
<p>
     But the multinational military force in Haiti is well armed, and neither Philippe's rebels nor the militant, pro-Aristide &quot;chimeres&quot; have been bold enough to confront them. Some residents of Cite Soleil say they are still afraid to come out, fearful of becoming victims of revenge killings by former members of the army or residual members of Philippe's force.</p>
<p>
     Riguet Joseph, 25, said his neighbors slept on their roofs or in small boats at night to avoid being killed by political foes, and wouldn't be safe unless and until Aristide came back into power.</p>
<p>
     &quot;We won't recognize any other government,&quot; Joseph said. &quot;If they give us a new prime minister, we're going to burn the country.&quot;</p>
