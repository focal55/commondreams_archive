<B>Saturday, May 15, 2004</B> - As state prosecutors weigh criminal and civil cases against Diebold Election Systems Inc. for using uncertified software in California elections, the state faces a potentially bigger problem: Other brands of voting software that record and count more than a million Californians' votes also may lack state or federal approval. 
<P>
State elections officials acknowledge that the state failed to maintain a master list of tested and certified voting software from as early as 1999 to the spring of 2003, a period of rapid evolution for computerized voting systems in California. 
<P>
In those years, the administration of then-Secretary of State and current U.S. Senate candidate Bill Jones approved new generations of voting machines. But scant record of state certification has been found for the all-important software inside, running everything from touchscreens and optical scanning machines to vote tallying and reporting of election results. 
<P>
During a two- to four-year gap -- from a vague series of approvals in late 1999, 2000 and 2001 to none from 2002 to April 2003 -- the nation's largest suppliers of voting sys-
<P>
tems, Elections Systems & Software and Diebold Election Systems Inc., flooded California with new versions of voting software without a clear record of whether they were nationally tested or certified for use in state elections, as required by state law. 
<P>
Jones spokesman Sean Walsh said the Central Valley Republican rancher was anything but lax in regulating voting systems. 
<P>
"The Jones administration was very vigorous in reactivating the Voting Systems Panel and were very vigorous in tracking the systems," Walsh said. Vendors were told repeatedly that any changes or upgrades needed state approval. 
<P>
"It's our belief that those processes and procedures were followed and that there should be paperwork in the secretary of state's office that reflects any changes that were made to hardware and software," Walsh said. "That paperwork should be made available to the public and the media." 
<P>
Voting-system companies, elections officials and advocates of stronger elections regulation agree California certification practices have been inconsistent over the years, tightening up only recently under Secretary of State Kevin Shelley. 
<P>
"There have been decades of neglect on this issue. There have been decades of poor oversight at the state and federal level," said Kim Alexander, president of the Davis-based nonprofit California Voter Foundation. "The agency has a history of dropping the ball on this." 
<P>
Shelley and his voting systems panel ordered a statewide audit of voting systems after Diebold was found to have deployed uncertified software in all 17 of its then-client counties, including Alameda. 
<P>
"The Shelley administration has taken a very, very aggressive, public approach in letting vendors and counties know that this is a regulatory agency and that hardware, software and firmware changes need state certification," said Shelley spokesman Doug Stone. 
<P>
"This is something the secretary feels strongly needs to be done and as quickly as possible," he said. 
<P>
It is unclear whether the gap in approvals of California voting software is due to poor record keeping, lax or informal certification practices or both. 
<P>
"My guess is this is more sloppiness than anything else, but this is unacceptably sloppy for elections," said David Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and chairman of a technical advisory panel to Shelley on voting systems. "It's extreme for a national security application." 
<P>
Voters in counties such as San Francisco, San Mateo and Merced use optical scanning and touchscreen machines partly approved by California's last three secretaries of state, for example. But state and local officials have been unable to locate proof of certification for major software supplied by Omaha, Neb.-based Elections Systems & Software to record, tally and report votes. 
<P>
Billing itself as "the world's largest and most experienced provider of election systems," ES&S also plays an unusually strong role in local elections. 
<P>
In San Francisco, Colusa, San Mateo and Stanislaus counties, a recent state audit shows, ES&S runs the vote-tallying and elections-reporting software on election day. There, working behind the scenes, the nation's largest voting-systems corporation -- under varying degrees of local supervision -- counts and reports the choices of almost a million registered voters, using software for which no clear state approval can be found. Elections chiefs in San Francisco and San Mateo said they had no documented certification for their voting software. San Francisco elections director John Arntz said he was certain the system was certified. 
<P>
"You talk to ES&S about this. They're the experts on the software and the system," Arntz said. 
<P>
In a recent review of proposed modifications to San Francisco's voting system to allow instant runoff voting, state analysts suggested that none of the current voting software used to read ballots, tally votes and report results appears to have undergone federal testing and approval. 
<P>
The optical scanning machines were certified by California in 1996 for a defunct company but only for use with a certain type of vote-tallying software. ES&S since has changed to new vote-tallying software and appears to have changed the optical scanning software as well. San Mateo County uses a nearly identical system. 
<P>
Officials in both counties say their tests and state-mandated recounts of1 percent of ballots show the systems are accurate. 
<P>
One of the latest California officials to handle voting-system testing and certification is Lou Dedier, who now works for ES&S as vice president and California general manager. He referred all questions to ES&S' public relations firm, Fleishman-Hillard Inc. 
<P>
Fleishman's Becky Vollmer initially directed inquiries back to California's Office of the Secretary of State. 
<P>
Given three weeks by the Oakland Tribune, neither California elections officials nor ES&S officials nor Fleishman-Hillard could supply a full, detailed list of state-approved ES&S voting software. 
<P>
"We recognize the importance of certification. It is something we take very seriously," Vollmer said. "We have a whole, dedicated team of people who work on certification issues on the national and state level. To my knowledge, all of the voting systems that ES&S has in use in the state of California are approved for use both federally and at the state level." 
<P>
On behalf of ES&S, Vollmer supplied certificates of California certification for all of ES&S' voting machines. None shows approval of the software until 2003. 
<P>
Two other voting-system vendors in California -- Oakland-based Sequoia Voting Systems, supplier to 17 counties, and Austin, Texas-based Hart InterCivic, supplier of touchscreens to Orange County -- were able to supply documentation suggesting their software and hardware are approved at the national and state level. 
<P>
"We take certification seriously," said Hart InterCivic spokesman Britt Kauffman. "You just don't use uncertified software or hardware, period." 
<P>
Sequoia president Tracey Graham applauded Shelley for auditing voting systems and software in California. 
<P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that some of our competitors have not been as attentive to the rigors of the certification process as Sequoia has been," Graham said. 
<P>
Mid-level state elections officials are poring over boxes of old files to identify testing and approval for scores of pieces of software used across California. 
<P>
<P>
California's effort to understand whether vote-recording and vote-tabulating software in its counties was ever approved also is forcing state elections officials to recreate the actions of several people who briefly had responsibility for recommending certification of voting systems over the last five years. One is dead; others, such as Dedier, have moved into other government or private-sector jobs. 
<P>
John Mott-Smith, director of California's elections division, said his staff is looking for the certifications in hope of closing the gap in software certifications, running from late 1999 to April 2003. 
<P>
That period matches the rapid rise of electronic voting in California, enabled by the rewriting of state election rules to redefine ballots as virtual entities, shifting the burden of determining election results away from mechanical machines to computers and, overwhelmingly, the software running inside them. 
<P>
"I can't give you a level of confidence" that state elections officials can ascertain exactly what software was approved, Mott-Smith said on April 28. "But we're working on it."
<P>
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer has launched criminal and civil investigations of the Texas-based firm for alleged violations of several election laws, most concerning the deployment of uncertified software in its client counties as of late 2003. 
<P>
Diebold attorneys knew that a second, more sweeping audit of California voting systems was underway and hinted at mounting a plausible defense of selective prosecution: The state wasn't enforcing its own law, and other voting-system vendors -- and many California counties -- were doing what Diebold was doing.
