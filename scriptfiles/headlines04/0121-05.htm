<p>STOCKHOLM  - Parts of Europe and North America
could get drastically colder if warming Atlantic ocean currents
are halted by a surprise side-effect of global warming,
scientists said on Wednesday.
<p>
 The possible shut-down of the Gulf Stream is one of several
catastrophic changes -- ranging from collapses of fish stocks
to more frequent forest fires -- that could be triggered by
human activities, they said in a book launched in Sweden.
<p>
 "In the worst case it (the Gulf Stream) could shut down...
it might even happen this century," said Stefan Rahmstorf of
the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.
"This would trigger a regional cooling, but not an Ice Age."
<p>
 Climate models indicated a surge of fresh water into the
North Atlantic from a melting of northern glaciers caused by
global warming could stop the current that sweeps warm waters
from the Gulf of Mexico toward Europe.
<p>
 "The Eastern coast of Canada and the United States would
also be affected. This is sometimes wrongly perceived as a
European problem by American politicians," he told Reuters.
<p>
 He said the Gulf Stream had collapsed about 20 times in the
past 100,000 years, most recently at the tail of the last Ice
Age about 8,000 years ago after an abrupt melting of icecaps.
<p>
 If the Gulf Stream stopped, average temperatures might fall
by 5-10 Celsius (10-20F) in Scandinavia or by 3-4C in Germany.
<p>
 By contrast, global warming, widely blamed on emissions of
gases like carbon dioxide from cars and factories, is expected
to raise global average temperatures by 1.4-5.8C by 2100.
<p>
The U.N. Kyoto Protocol  on limiting global warming hinges
on Russia's yes or no. Moscow is undecided and President
Vladimir Putin  said his country might benefit from warmer world
weather, though a halt of Gulf Stream would make northwest
Russia colder.
<p>
 Rahmstorf's study was included in a new book, "Global
Change and the Earth System: A Planet Under Pressure," which
looks at the impact of the surge in the human population to six
billion people, ranging from stripped forests to rising
temperatures.
<p>
 "A major finding is that change will not be progressive.
There will be abrupt changes and tipping points," said Will
Steffen, executive director of the International
Geosphere-Biosphere Program which issued the book based on work
by 5,000 scientists.
<p>
 "Never before have we seen the range of change or the rate
of change at the same time," he told Reuters.
<p>
 "You can get to a point where forests are too hot and too
dry and sudden fires rip through them," he said, referring to
blazes last year in nations from Australia to France. "Global
warming may make these events more frequent."
<p>
 And another report indicated that fish stocks might not
recover even if nations ban fishing. Depletion of cod stocks,
for instance, lets smaller species flourish and these may prey
on the young of any surviving cod and prevent stock recovery.
