<p>George Bush has squandered a wealth of sympathy  around the world towards America since September 11  with public opinion in 10 leading countries - including  some of its closest allies - growing more hostile to the  United States while he has been in office. 
<p>According to a survey, voters in eight out of the 10  countries, including Britain, want to see the Democrat  challenger, John Kerry, defeat President Bush in next  month's US presidential election.
<p>The poll, conducted by 10 of the world's leading  newspapers, including France's Le Monde, Japan's  Asahi Shimbun, Canada's La Presse, the Sydney  Morning Herald and the Guardian, also shows that on  balance world opinion does not believe that the war in  Iraq has made a positive contribution to the fight  against terror.
<p>The results show that in Australia, Britain, Canada,  France, Japan, Spain and South Korea a majority of  voters share a rejection of the Iraq invasion, contempt  for the Bush administration, a growing hostility to the  US and a not-too-strong endorsement of Mr Kerry. But  they all make a clear distinction between this kind of  anti-Americanism and expressing a dislike of American  people. On average 68% of those polled say they have  a favourable opinion of Americans.
<p>The 10-country poll suggests that rarely has an  American administration faced such isolation and lack  of public support amongst its closest allies.
<p>The only exceptions to this trend are the Israelis - who back Bush 2-1 over Kerry and see the US as their  security umbrella - and the Russians who, despite their traditional anti-Americanism, recorded unexpectedly  favourable attitudes towards the US in the survey  conducted in the immediate aftermath of the Beslan tragedy.
<p>The UK results of the poll conducted by ICM research for the Guardian reveal a growing disillusionment with  the US amongst the British public, fuelled by a strong  personal antipathy towards Mr Bush.
<p>The ICM survey shows that if the British had a vote in the US presidential elections on November 2 they would vote 50% for Kerry and only 22% for Bush.
<p>Sixty per cent of British voters say they don't like Bush, rising to a startling 77% among those under 25.
<p>The rejection of Mr Bush is strongest in France where  72% say they would back Mr Kerry but it is also very  strong in traditionally very pro-American South Korea, where fears of a pre-emptive US strike against North Korea have translated into 68% support for Mr Kerry.
<p>In Britain the growth in anti-Americanism is not so  marked as in France, Japan, Canada, South Korea or  Spain where more than 60% say their view of the United States has deteriorated since September 11. But a sizeable and emerging minority - 45% - of British  voters say their image of the US has got worse in the  past three years and only 15% say it has improved.
<p>There is a widespread agreement that America will remain the world's largest economic power.
<p>This is underlined by the 73% of British voters who say  that the US now wields an excessive influence on  international affairs, a situation that 67% see as continuing for the foreseeable future.
<p>A majority in Britain also believe that US democracy is  no longer a model for others.
<p>But perhaps a more startling finding from the Guardian/ICM poll is that a majority of British voters - 51% - say that they believe that American culture is threatening our own culture.
<p>This is a fear shared by the Canadians, Mexicans and  South Koreans, but it is more usually associated with  the French than the British. Perhaps the endless television reruns of Friends and the Simpsons are  beginning to take their toll.
<p><B><i>&#183;</i></B><i> ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,008 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between September  22-23 2004. Interviews were conducted across the  country and the results have been weighted to the  profile of all adults.</i></P>
