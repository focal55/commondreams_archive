<p>KABUL, Afghanistan --
Ghazal laughed as she clumsily knocked the soccer ball around the 
dusty, walled-in courtyard with her sandaled foot, passing it off to a small 
cluster of teenage girls. But even as she smiled, the corners of her mouth 
turned down delicately, a hint that she knows her joy will vanish soon. 
<P>For four months, the 21-year-old civil liberties activist has been 
teaching 120 local women and girls to read, write, take care of their health 
and not be afraid to stand up for their rights. But two months ago, her work 
at the Afghan Center, a humanitarian organization that provides general and 
vocational education for women in Kabul, was undercut by her own family.

They made clear to her that because she is an Afghan woman, she has no 
rights. 
<P>In February, Ghazal's parents informed her that they had engaged her to 
marry her cousin, Rafi, 28, an unemployed carpenter in the tiny village of 
Reshkhor. They expect the striking young woman with an arresting Sandra 
Bullock-like smile to move from the cosmopolitan capital of Kabul and to be 
confined to a lifetime of cleaning Rafi's house, cooking his food, washing his 
clothes and bearing his children.
<P>"It is so ironic. I help women to defend their rights, but my family is ..
." suddenly, awkwardly, Ghazal whispered an English swear-word and immediately 
blushed. 
<P>"It's a tragedy! He is stupid. I don't want to marry him," she said, and 
her thin, golden bracelets jiggled as she dropped her slender hands in 
exasperation. 
<P>In theory, women have constitutional rights equal to men's in post-
Taliban Afghanistan. But in reality, their lives have improved little since 
the demise of the ultraconservative Islamic regime, which banned women from 
attending schools and public baths and whose Police for the Protection of 
Virtue and the Prevention of Vice ordered women to cover themselves in 
traditional head-to-toe burqas  --  beating those who disobeyed.
<P>This country supposedly was liberated by the U.S.-led military campaign 
that ousted the Taliban, but the conservative warlords who run Afghanistan's 
far-flung provinces support strict rules that bar women from public life and 
turn a blind eye when their armed militias rape women and girls.
<P>As many as 1 million girls between 7 and 13 do not attend school, the 
United Nations' Children's Fund reports. Parents continue to sell their 
daughters, often as young as 8, into marriages that often resemble 
imprisonment, turning girls into housewives who rarely, if ever, are allowed 
to step outside their husbands' mud-brick compounds. 
<P>"Nearly two years on, discrimination, violence and insecurity remain rife,
despite promises by world leaders, including President Bush and Secretary of 
Sate Colin Powell, that the war in Afghanistan would bring liberation for 
women," Amnesty International wrote in its most recent report on the 
conditions of women in Afghanistan. The organization documents widespread 
domestic violence, forced marriage and rape of girls and women by armed 
militias.
<P>Ghazal's family is in fact liberal for Afghans. Her father, now 82, is a 
former carpenter who shepherded his wife and children out of the Kabul area 
during the savage factional fighting of the early 1990s. They spent 12 years 
in a Pakistani refugee camp, where Ghazal received an education and learned to 
speak fluent English. 
<P>"My family didn't used to be like this," she said. "But now, my father 
tells me: 'You mustn't complain. This is the Afghan way.' "
<P>Ghazal fears that in the village where her betrothed lives there will be 
little tolerance for her worldly manners or for her desire to promote women's 
rights. In rural Afghanistan, husbands and their families often treat their 
wives little better than cattle, she said, and leaving abusive relationships 
continues to be socially unacceptable for women. 
<P>"If an (abused) woman tries to seek refuge in her parents' house, most 
parents would reject her or possibly even kill her or call the other family 
and say 'come get your wife,' because for them it's a disgrace," said Duaine 
Goodno, who runs the Afghan Center.
<P>Women rarely seek divorces, because typically it would leave them 
homeless. There virtually is no place for them as single workers in 
Afghanistan's devastated economy.
<P>According to the Amnesty report, women who try to seek redress with the 
police or with courts usually face extreme bias: "The current criminal justice 
system ... is more likely to violate the rights of women than to protect and 
uphold their rights."
<P>For example, Goodno said, Kabul's few government-run safe houses for 
battered women encourage the women to return home. He said police typically 
take the husband's side in domestic conflicts.
<P>In the absence of reliable shelters, with no place to go, some Afghan 
women use Kabul's Alaoddin  One Hundred Bed Mental Hospital as a safe house. 
Despite its unequivocal name, the hospital has only 60 beds.

On a tattered cot by the entrance to the women's ward, Anaita,  a 27-year-
old from central Ghazni province, said that during her two-year marriage, the 
constant abuse she endured from her in-laws drove her to lock herself up in 
her room for months, only going to the bathroom at night when everyone else in 
the house was asleep.
<P>"They insult my mother and father and myself, using words I cannot repeat,
" she said in a near whisper, a black shawl framing her pale face. "When I 
hear their bad words, I would just start shaking."
<P>Two cots away, Shaima, 30, said she had lost her appetite and sleep 
trying to manage her 10 children  --  ages 9 months to 14 years  --  and serve 
her uncaring husband, Mohammed Ayub.
<P>Married against her will at the age of 12 to a man 20 years her elder, 
Shaima said she had never gotten any help around the house from her 
schoolteacher husband, who she said "is very rude with me and with the 
children."
<P>"When my baby cries, he yells: 'Can't you shut him up?' When I serve his 
lunch five minutes late, he yells, 'Don't you know to make lunch at noon?' " 
said Shaima, who bears a tribal tattoo that dots the spot between her arched 
eyebrows.
<P>"Her husband is an awful man, and he treats her badly," said Khanin Gul, 
Shaima's sister, who had come to visit her at the hospital. "Afghan women have 
two problems: children and husbands."
<P>Desperate to get out of abusive marriages, women are increasingly turning 
to suicide, an unspeakable sin in the Muslim faith.
<P>Human rights groups say that between 50 and 80 women have set themselves 
ablaze in the past year in the western city of Herat. Most of them were 
married or engaged; one was a 13-year-old bride. Goodno said that unhappy 
marriages also drive women to self-immolations in other parts of the country, 
but they rarely get reported.
<P>Ghazal theoretically has some protections under the law  --  she could 

get the engagement annulled if she could persuade both families to appear 
before a judge, then convince the jurist that she is being forced against her 
will to marry her cousin.
<P>But Afghan customs have conspired to override what is written in the 
legal statutes. Both sets of parents refuse to go to court. Ghazal could ask 
the police to compel their appearance, but her older brother has threatened to 
kill her if she does.
<P>"The West needs to educate the Afghan government so that it protects 
women's rights," Ghazal said, her mouth twisting again into a tragic smile. 
"Right now, the mind of the people of Afghanistan is very dark."
