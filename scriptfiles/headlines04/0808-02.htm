<p>BAGHDAD  - 
The caretaker Iraqi government ordered pan-Arab television channel Al-Jazeera to close its offices in Baghdad for 30 days following charges it is inciting violence.

Images later broadcast by Al-Jazeera showed Iraqi police issuing the closure order although the channel vowed to continue its Iraq coverage.
 <p>
 Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib announced the news at a Baghdad press conference following an order from the national security committee.
 <p>
 Prime Minister Iyad Allawi added: "We have asked an independent committee to monitor Al-Jazeera for the last four weeks... to see what kind of violence they are advocating, inciting hatred and problems and racial tensions."
 <p>
 "This is a decision taken by the national security committee to protect the people of Iraq, in the interests of the Iraqi people," he said.
 <p>
 The Iraqi government move was earlier reported by the Doha-based channel, which did not air the live news conference in Baghdad.
 <p>
 "Iraqi authorities decide to close the Al-Jazeera office in Baghdad for a month," read an urgent banner on the television which gave no more details on the reasons for the closure.
 <p>
 The news was followed by a report on US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accusing Al-Jazeera and the other main Arab news channel Al-Arabiya of harming the image of the United States in the Arab world.
 <p>
 Rumsfeld made the remarks at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, said Al-Jazeera.
 <p>
 Al-Jazeera later issued a statement on its website expressing "regret for the unjustified move," which it argued "was contrary to pledges made by the Iraqi government to start a new era of free speech and openness."
 <p>
 "Al-Jazeera has vowed to continue its Iraq coverage despite the one month closure of its Baghdad office announced by the Iraqi interim government on Saturday," according to the website.
 <p>
 Iraqi police officers arrived in the evening at the Baghdad office to shut the operation down, although the channel complained the officers did not provide a legal document from an Iraqi court.
 <p>
 Earlier this month, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari also criticised Al-Jazeera, the Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya and other Arab and Iranian stations for their coverage of Iraq and threatened to close their Baghdad offices.
 <p>
 Zebari said Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim radical Hezbollah's Al-Manar television and Iran's Al-Alam were "channels of incitement working against the interests, security and stability of the Iraqi people".
 <p>
 "We will no longer tolerate this in the future," said Zebari.
 <p>
 Al-Jazeera has frequently been accused by US and Iraqi authorities of inciting violence by screening "exclusive" video tapes from Muslim extremists, including Al-Qaeda terror network mastermind Osama bin Laden.
