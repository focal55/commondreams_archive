      <p>FALLUJA, Iraq - U.S. artillery shelled Falluja on Thursday after overnight 
        air and tank attacks killed five people in Iraq 's most rebellious city, 
        braced for an all-out offensive now the U.S. presidential election is 
        over. 
      <p> The U.S. military said two air raids after midnight destroyed "fighting 
        barricades" prepared by insurgents in the northeast and southeast of the 
        Sunni Muslim city.

The strikes followed what witnesses called an intense half- hour bombardment 
        of eastern and northwestern areas by AC-130 planes and tanks that shook 
        the city late on Wednesday night. 
      <p> They said the attacks were the heaviest for several weeks. Hospital 
        doctor Ahmed Mohammed said five people had been killed, including a woman 
        and a child. All had been in a car hit in an air raid while trying to 
        escape the violence. 
      <p> U.S. artillery was back in action during the day, a Reuters reporter 
        with Marines near Falluja said. 
      <p> A woman was badly wounded and a teenage girl lost a leg in earlier air 
        strikes on Wednesday, hospital officials said. 
      <p> U.S. Marines are poised to assault Falluja, 30 miles west of Baghdad, 
        and its sister city of Ramadi, as part of the interim government's drive 
        to pacify Iraq before national elections planned for January. 
      <p> The Marines have so far stayed mainly at the edge of the city, most 
        of whose 300,000 people have already fled. 
      <p> Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, now visiting Europe, has not publicly 
        given the go-ahead for the storming of Falluja and Ramadi, but the Marines 
        say they only need the order from him and newly re-elected President Bush. 
      <p> Shi'ites in the slums of Sadr City, where anti-American cleric Moqtada 
        al-Sadr has a strong following, said Bush must now keep his pledges to 
        reconstruct Iraq and hold elections. 
      <p> "It is Bush who destroyed this country and our city and he is obliged 
        to rebuild them," said resident Qassem al-Kaabi. 
      <p> Fattah al-Sheikh, editor of a pro-Sadr newspaper, said Bush should pay 
        more attention to Iraq and shun military options. 
      <p> "We want the Americans to promote the political process in Iraq, especially 
        the coming elections," he said. 
      <p> HOSTAGES 
      <p> Sadr, whose militia staged two uprisings this year, has recently moved 
        toward joining the political process, ordering his Mehdi Army fighters 
        to hand in their weapons in Sadr City. 
      <p> People in Falluja said the prospect of four more years of Bush depressed 
        them and one man, Sattar Ibrahim, 30, said his family had hoped challenger 
        John Kerry would win because they believed he would have improved chances 
        for peace. 
      <p> "Choosing Bush creates a crisis for Iraqis and especially for Falluja 
        because we believe he will continue his policy against our country and 
        our city," said Mohammed Ali. 
      <p> "His policy is based on violence and hatred against Muslims and Arabs," 
        the 20-year-old student added. 
      <p> Other Iraqis have said they are too busy trying to survive postwar bloodshed 
        and kidnapping to care about the U.S. vote. 
      <p> A car bomb went off in the town of Iskandariya, some 50 km (30 miles) 
        south of Baghdad, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. He had no immediate 
        word on casualties. 
      <p> Militants in Iraq issued a videotape of three Jordanian truck drivers 
        shown pleading with their government to warn its nationals against working 
        with U.S.-led forces in the country. 
      <p> "We will not have mercy on anyone. We will strike with an iron fist 
        whoever deals with the occupation," one of three masked gunmen said on 
        the videotape released to Reuters. 
      <p> It showed three Jordanian drivers sitting in front of the gunmen under 
        a black banner that reads Army of Islam Counter Attack Brigades. The tape 
        showed close-ups of their passports. 
      <p> It was not immediately clear if the three captives were among four Jordanian 
        drivers that a Foreign Ministry official in Amman said were kidnapped 
        in western Iraq on Tuesday. 
      <p> Militants have seized scores of foreigners since April to try to drive 
        foreign troops and workers from Iraq. Many have been freed. More than 
        35 have been killed, some beheaded. 
      <p> There was no word on whether the unidentified captors of British-Iraqi 
        aid worker Margaret Hassan had carried out a threat made on Tuesday to 
        hand her to a group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi within 48 hours unless 
        British troops quit Iraq. 
      <p> Zarqawi's group has claimed responsibility for hostage beheadings and 
        some of Iraq's bloodiest suicide attacks. 
      <p> Two Americans, one of Lebanese origin, a Nepali and a Filipino are among 
        foreigners seized in Iraq this week.
