<p>DES MOINES,  Jan. 3 &#0151; Senator John Kerry reached into the past on Saturday with an endorsement &#0151;  and a 10-minute song of tribute &#0151;  from Peter Yarrow, a member of the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary.</p>
<P>
But the mini-celebrity moment took a turn when Mr. Yarrow, a peace activist since before the two men met protesting Vietnam, was asked if he was disturbed that Mr. Kerry voted in favor of war in Iraq.</p>
<P>
"Absolutely!" Mr. Yarrow shouted to a questioner, and he raised his hands to try to command the attention of reporters and Kerry supporters at the police union hall here.</p>
<P>
"Let me say this," Mr. Yarrow said. "I fought with John about this. I said, `This is  crazy!' "</p>
<P>
Asked if the war vote had hurt Mr. Kerry's candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Yarrow responded, "Oh sure, sure."</p>
<P>
Mr. Yarrow said that Mr. Kerry told him had seen information that justified the war. "He said, `Peter, I'm on the intelligence committee,' " Mr. Yarrow said. "I know they have weaponry, nuclear weaponry, and I have the absolute assurance they'll go only with the United Nations. He was like everybody else &#0151; lied to by people who have no honor."</p>
<P>
Mr. Kerry's advisers tried to end the scene,  telling Mr. Yarrow that the senator was on the bus. Mr. Yarrow started for the door but did an about-face when he saw Mr. Kerry was  still  in the room.</p>
<P>
"John is over there. John is not done talking," Mr. Yarrow said. "Don't try to move me when I'm still talking."</p>
<P>
Mr. Yarrow returned and shared his favorite line in the Kerry song: "These bullies now in power echo fascists' great tradition: Keep us scared, create a war and stifle opposition."`</p>
<P>
Mr. Kerry said he was not disturbed by the difference of opinion. "He understands my point of view, and I understand his," he said.</p>
