<p>WASHINGTON - Senior officials in the Bush administration clashed yesterday over Iraq's transition to democracy after the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, suggested that the elections in January might be limited because of the chaos in parts of the country. 
<P>Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state contradicted the suggestion, insisting that the landmark vote had to take place in all regions, including those racked by insurgency.  <P>"I know of no changes and no plans," Mr Armitage said yesterday. "I think we're going to have an election that is free and open, and that has to be open to all citizens," he told a congressional committee.  <P>"We've got to do our best efforts to get in troubled areas. ... I think we're going to have these elections in all parts of the country."  <P>Mr Rumsfeld agreed yesterday that every Iraqi "deserves the right to vote". But he added that the situation was "uneven" and that "some locations are going to present somewhat greater challenges than others". Earlier he had said that an election in three-quarters of the country would be better than no vote at all.  <P>The defence secretary added yesterday that US troops could start leaving Iraq before the country was peaceful again, and he compared the situation in the war-torn areas of the country to US inner cities.  <P>"We had something like 200 or 300 or 400 people killed in many of the major cities of America last year.  <P>"Is it perfectly peaceful? No. What's the difference? We just didn't see each homicide in every major city in the United States on television   every night," Mr Rumsfeld said.
</div><P>The Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry, seized on the different signals coming from the administration, as he switched the focus of his campaign on Iraq.  <P>"If there was any doubt that the leaders of the Bush Administration are living in a fantasy world of spin, I think Secretary Rumsfeld put that doubt to rest," Mr Kerry said. "We need to end this confusion. We need national leaders who will face reality - not only in Iraq but in the war on terror."  <P>The strategy of challenging his opponent's strongest suit - national security - is a gamble. Polls suggest that a significant majority of Americans trust the president more on Iraq and the "war on terror". Mr Kerry is behind in all the latest national polls, but appears to have closed the gap with Mr Bush to within five points over the past week.  <P>Repeating his assertion that the war in Iraq was a dangerous diversion from the US "war on terror", Mr Kerry said: "An estimated 18,000 al-Qaida-trained militants are operating in 60 countries around the world in a dangerous and more elusive network of extremist groups."  <P>The remark was a direct response to the president's claims that three-quarters of al-Qaida's leadership had been captured or killed.  <P>Mr Kerry argued the most likely source terrorists would look to for weapons of mass destruction was the former Soviet Union, and that the administration was doing little to secure them.  <P>"More such materials were secured in the two years before 9/11 than in the two years after," he said. "I will secure all   nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union within four years. At President Bush's pace, it will take 13 years."  <P>Jeff Shesol, a political historian and a former speechwriter for Bill Clinton, said Mr Kerry had little choice but to mount an attack on the president's strongest issue, in defiance of advice from some senior Democrats to stick to domestic issues.  <P>"He's got to do it if he's going to win," Mr Shesol said. "There's always a temptation for Democrats to say, 'Let's run on our issues and let them run on their issues.' But when 'their issues' are on the top of people's list of concerns, we would be unwise to give them a by."  <P>The Republican response to the attacks on the administration's foreign policy has been to suggest that a vote for Mr Kerry would help to undermine US troops in Iraq and weaken the fight against al-Qaida.  <P>Such sentiments have triggered outrage among Democrats, who say they go beyond the normal bounds of campaign debate. The Kerry campaign called the remarks un-American and undemocratic.  <P>Michael Wissot, a pollster for Luntz Research, which mainly advises Republican candidates, said the rhetoric ran the risk of backfiring, "because people understand that this is much more than a question of an individual, and much more a question of collective policy decisions".  <P><B>&#183;</B> Three more members of an elite navy Seal unit have been charged with abusing Iraqi prisoners, one of whom died in custody after he had been beaten.</p>
