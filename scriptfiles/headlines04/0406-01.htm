<!--/endimage/-->COPENHAGEN, Denmark - Iraq&nbsp; is worse off now, after the U.S.-led invasion, than it was under Saddam Hussein, Hans Blix told a Danish newspaper Tuesday. 

<p>
"What's positive is that Saddam and his bloody regime is gone, but when figuring out the score, the negatives weigh more," the former chief U.N. weapons inspector was quoted as saying in the daily newspaper <a href="http://www.jp.dk/" target="_new">Jyllands Posten</a>. 


<p>"That accounts for the many casualties during the war and the many people who still die because of the terrorism the war has nourished," he said. "The war has liberated the Iraqis from Saddam, but the costs have been too great." 


<p>Blix, whose inspection team didn't make any significant weapons finds during months of searching Iraq before the war, has sharply criticized the United States and Britain for their invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein's regime. 


<p>The primary reason given for the invasion was to rid the country of weapons of mass destruction. None were found during or after the invasion. 


<p>The former Swedish foreign minister currently heads a newly created Stockholm-based independent commission on weapons of mass destruction.
