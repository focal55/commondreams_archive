<p>BURLINGTON, Vt.  - Democratic presidential hopeful  Howard Dean, struggling to get his White House bid back on  track after crushing losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, replaced  his campaign manager on Wednesday with a longtime aide to  former Vice President Al Gore.<p> 
			
							Dean, the former governor of Vermont running as an outsider  with an anti-establishment message, named Washington operative  Roy Neel to try to steady his slide from one-time front-runner  to also-ran in the first two contests of the 2004 election  season.<p> 
			
							Former campaign manager Joe Trippi, the Internet guru who  helped propel Dean from a little-known former governor of a  small Northeastern state to the top of the Democratic field,  quit rather than accept a different position, political sources  said.<p> 
			
							"Governor Dean asked Roy Neel to join the campaign and Joe  Trippi resigned as campaign manager," spokesman Doug Thornell  said.<p> 
			
							While Dean was closeted in staff meetings in Burlington and  sitting for satellite interviews with television outlets in 12  states that hold contests next Tuesday and beyond, his rivals  were already campaigning for votes in the South and West.<p> 
			
							The turmoil in the Dean campaign followed a devastating  20-point loss to Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry in Iowa on Jan.  19 and a televised concession speech that turned into a  fist-pumping, bellowing rant.<p> 
			
							Going into New Hampshire, Dean was trailing Kerry by as  many as 25 points. He managed to eke out second place in  Tuesday's primary, finishing 13 points behind Kerry. Aides had  said he needed to close the gap to single digits to right his  foundering campaign.<p> 
			
							FOCUS ON TUESDAY<p> 
			
							Dean said in the satellite interviews he planned to compete  in all Tuesday's seven contests. But he had shifted resources  to New Hampshire, spending $1.5 million on advertising in the  final week, and his campaign is looking at cost-cutting  measures.<p> 
			

							With Trippi's help, Dean raised $40 million by the end of  last year -- more than any other Democrat -- mostly through  small donations over the Internet.<p> 
			
							Political analysts said back-to-back double-digit losses  were not good enough for a man who dominated the race through  the summer and fall and that Dean needed to prove he could win  a race soon, preferably on Tuesday when seven states hold  primaries or caucuses.<p> 
			
							Dean said he was determined to stay in the race for the  long haul but played down expectations for Tuesday.<p> 
			
							"We've got enough money and enough volunteers and  organization to go to the convention," he said. "I don't think  we have to win one although were going to play to win every  single one of them. What we have to do is get more delegates  than anybody else."<p> 
			
							Neel, a longtime friend and aide of Gore, was also former  President Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff. Gore has  formally endorsed Dean and will campaign for him in South  Carolina later this week.<p> 
			
							From 1977 to 1994, Neel served in key roles in Gore's  Washington operations, first as his chief of staff in Congress  and then in the same job when Gore became vice president.<p> 
			
							Prior to leaving the White House, he served as Clinton's  deputy chief of staff, responsible for coordinating all policy  and communications activities. Neel also managed Gore's  campaign in 1992.<p> 
			
							Trippi, 47, has worked for a series of past Democratic  campaigns, among them the unsuccessful White House bids of  Edward Kennedy, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart and Richard Gephardt,  a rival of Dean's until he pulled out of the 2004 race after  finishing fourth in Iowa on Jan. 19.
