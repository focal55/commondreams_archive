<p>WASHINGTON --
A recent classified assessment of U.S. military detention facilities 
in Afghanistan found that they have been plagued by many of the problems that 
existed at military prisons in Iraq, including weak or nonexistent guidance 
for interrogators, creating what the assessment described as an "opportunity" 
for prisoner abuse.
<P>The inspection, conducted this summer by a one-star Army general, has not 
been publicly released by the Defense Department. But three government 
officials privy to its conclusions said this week that the report had found a 
wide range of shortcomings in the military's handling of prisoners in 
Afghanistan, including an unwarranted use of rectal exams instead of metal 
wands to search for contraband.
<P>Army Brig. Gen. Charles Jacoby, who was ordered to conduct the survey in 
May by the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan after the military's 
abuse of Iraqi prisoners became public knowledge, found that just half of the 
roughly two dozen U.S. prisons in Afghanistan had posted written orders 
spelling out approved interrogation practices.

<P>Jacoby also found those practices in need of revision and better 
enforcement, according to the government officials. Lacking any approved 
guidance, U.S. military commanders in the field were using their own judgment 
about how prisoners should be handled, opening the door to abuse and a loss of 
valuable intelligence, the officials said Jacoby concluded.
<P>At the time of Jacoby's visit, senior U.S. military officials in Iraq and 
Washington had known for more than four months about photographic evidence of 
abused prisoners in Iraq. Senior U.S. military officers in the region also had 
known for more than five months about an Army report alleging abuses by a CIA-
Special Operations Forces group in Iraq.
<P>A spokeswoman for the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan, Lt. Col. 
Pamela Keeton, said Thursday that while Jacoby did not find any instances of 
abuse under way during his visit, he did find that prison officers needed 
better military rules and training.
<P>She said, for example, that before his inspection, prisoners could be 
held for indefinite periods at temporary prison facilities, where 
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross had no access 
to them. Now, Keeton said, U.S. military rules bar the detention of any 
prisoner at a temporary prison for more than 10 days without release or 
transfer to a regular prison, and Red Cross representatives must be provided 
access within 15 days of their detention.
<P>Keeton also said the practice of conducting invasive bodily searches 
among prisoners had been stopped in most cases.
<P>Efforts also have been made to curtail the number of temporary prisons in 
the field, she said. Jacoby's report suggested that the worst conduct may have 
occurred at such facilities.
<P>Although the report represents the military's first attempt to survey the 
scope of prison shortcomings in Afghanistan, suggestions of widespread abuses 
there had turned up earlier this year, when Army investigators looked into 
mistreatment of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
<P>Many of the officials at Abu Ghraib had served in Afghanistan and honed 
their approach to handling prisoners there, according to two Defense 
Department reports issued in August. 
<P>The reports said, for example, that the idea of using dogs to intimidate 
prisoners at Abu Ghraib migrated from Afghanistan, where U.S. soldiers noted 
that many citizens feared dogs. Other methods transferred to Iraq included 
stripping prisoners, forcing them into stress positions and depriving them of 
light, sleep or human contact.
<P>Also, a report by investigators with the Army's Criminal Investigation 
Command, completed in May on the eve of Jacoby's visit and stamped "For 
Official Use Only," implicated more than two dozen military police officers in 
the deaths of two Afghan prisoners in Bagram, Afghanistan, in 2002.
<P>That Army report, obtained by the Washington Post, also said a senior 
officer of the 377th Military Police Company based in Cincinnati and 
eventually deployed to Iraq had admitted he knew his soldiers were striking 
detainees in Afghanistan, and it concluded that his dereliction of duty 
contributed to routine prisoner mistreatment.
<P>The report listed a range of abuses committed by members of the 377th and 
a battalion of military intelligence officers from Fort Bragg, N.C., during 
their deployment to Afghanistan.
<P>U.S. forces have "tightened up procedures for training up our people to 
handle and care for the prisoners," Keeton said. They now have standard 
operating procedures in place, she said, and mechanisms to enforce them.</p>
