<p>NEW YORK  - U.S. retail gasoline prices rose to  their highest level on record Tuesday, spelling pain at the  pumps for the nation's 200 million motorists, the American  Automobile Association said on Tuesday.
<p> 
			
			The average price for regular gasoline struck $1.738 per  gallon, up a tenth of a cent from the previous record hit in  late summer 2003, according to the motorist group's survey of  more than 60,000 stations.<p>

While an all-time high in nominal terms, the current price  of gasoline is still significantly lower than the inflation  adjusted peak of $2.94 hit in 1981, and well below the prices  seen regularly in European countries.<p> 
			
			"Economists may find it helpful to discuss inflation  adjustment, but a big increase in the monthly gasoline bill is  a large burden to this country's families and businesses  regardless," said AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom.<p> 
			
			Energy prices have been on the rise in recent months due to  paper-thin U.S. stockpiles lingering near their lowest levels  since the 1970s and economic growth that has spurred higher  global fuel demand.<p> 
			
			Oil producer group OPEC, which controls roughly half of the  world's exported crude, is also mulling a new reduction in  supplies starting April 1, adding to a series of cuts that  recently brought oil prices to nearly $40 a barrel.<p> 
			
			"The role of OPEC in these high prices is substantial this  year," AAA's Sundstrom said.<p> 
			
			The U.S. government on Monday predicted prices would  average a record $1.83 per gallon in April and May during the  run-up to the summer driving season when Americans typically  take to the roads.<p> 
			
			Energy Information Administration chief Guy Caruso said at  an oil industry meeting in San Antonio on Monday that he was  "really concerned" about thin U.S. gasoline inventories, which  are running about 13 million barrels lower than the agency had  projected.<p> 
			
			The volatile gasoline landscape has drawn the attention of  lawmakers from both political parties, making it a likely issue  in this presidential election year.<p> 
			
			Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon on Monday reintroduced a  bill requiring the Federal Trade Commission to act on what he  called anti-competitive industry pricing policies.<p> 
			
			The FTC earlier this month opened an informal probe into  California's retail gasoline prices -- the highest in the  nation -- at the urging of Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of  California.<p> 
			
			Oil and gas refiners have denied using any anti-competitive  practices, instead blaming high prices on tight supplies caused  by dozens of different gasoline-blending rules for metropolitan  areas and the lack of enough imports of the motor fuel.<p> 
			
			Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said soaring  gasoline prices are a good reason for the Senate to pass a  stalled energy bill.<p> 
			
			AAA added in its release that state and federal government  officials need to take another look at policies that have  resulted in more than 15 different varieties of gasoline being  used across the United States each summer.<p> 
			
			"While these 'boutique' fuels have helped clean the air,  they also have seriously hampered the efficient production and  distribution of gasoline," AAA said.
			<p> 
			
			AAA is the largest motorist and travel group in the United  States, with about 47 million members.
