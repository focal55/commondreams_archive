<p>WASHINGTON  - 
FBI agents investigating the leaking of a CIA  agent's identity to the press have asked members of the US administration to waive confidentiality agreements with reporters, it was reported.
<p>
 
The requests, if signed, would give investigators new ammunition for questioning reporters who so far have kept mum about the case, Time Magazine reported.
<p>
 Former ambassador Joseph Wilson has alleged that his wife's professional identity was leaked in retaliation for his high-profile opposition to the war in Iraq.
<p>
 In an article for The New York Times on July 6 of this year, Wilson charged that President George W. Bush's administration had "twisted" evidence to exaggerate the case against Iraq.
<p>
 He said the Bush administration sent him to Niger in early 2002 to look into a charge that Saddam Hussein sought uranium from Africa, and that he had reported back that it was false.
<p>
 Even after a warning by the US State Department's intelligence service that the charge was "highly dubious," the accusation wound up in Bush's "State of the Union" address in January, sourced to the British government.
<p>
 A week later, conservative syndicated columnist Robert Novak cited "two senior administration officials" as telling him that the diplomat's wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA agent.
<p>
 It is a criminal offense to name a covert CIA agent.
<p>
 The scandal is the biggest to hit the administration since Bush took office in January 2001.
<p>
 The Justice Department  opened a formal investigation on September 30 into "possible unauthorized disclosures" of the agent's identity by the Bush administration.
<p>
 Attorney General John Ashcroft  withdrew from the politically sensitive probe earlier this week, prompting authorities to name a special counsel to head the investigation in his place.
<p>
 The requests could lead to the arrest of reporters who refuse to reveal the identities of their confidential sources.
<p>
 "From the prosecutors' point of view, it is likely a precursor to subpoenaing journalists to testify before a grand jury, and then asking a judge to hold them in contempt if they refuse to do so," Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press, told Time.
