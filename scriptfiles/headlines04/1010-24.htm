<p align="left">ST. LOUIS - It was not Missouri breaks. Friday night’s debate, between the Boston Brahmin and the Texas wrangler, did little to ease the excruciating tension of the US presidential race. The bout, the second of three, was as aggressive and testy in tone as any US presidential clash in decades. But there was no knock-out.

<p>President George W Bush and Senator John Kerry had tangled for 90-plus minutes, slamming each other on economic issues, health care and Iraq. At times, Bush seemed to struggle to rein in his anger, although he relaxed later, when the questioning shifted from Iraq and terrorism to domestic issues.

<p>He blinked, or smirked, although less often than in his disastrous meeting eight days earlier in Florida. That was even though Friday’s setting, in St Louis, Missouri, should have benefited him most.

<p>With a “town hall” format, voters asked the two candidates questions directly. Bush’s feisty ways, and ease at interacting with people, might have trumped Kerry’s tendency to patrician windiness.

<p>America’s reaction was initially mixed. Bush’s poor performance in the first debate, when he was also repetitive, is widely believed to have cost him his lead in the polls. The race is now too close to call.

<p>Bush’s most emotional moments came early , in front of 130 uncommitted voters chosen by the Gallup Organisation.

<p>“The president didn’t find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he’s turned his campaign into a weapon of mass destruction,” accused a composed and confident Kerry, moments into Friday’s showdown, as he bestrode the red-carpeted floor.

<p>“I don’t see how you can win if you don’t believe we should be there in the first place,” retorted Bush, his finger stabbing the air for emphasis.

<p>Kerry shot back with a line that his campaign is bound to use repeatedly: “He wants you to believe I can’t be president.” Bush, seated on a stool, widened his eyes and frowned.

<p>He interrupted the moderator, Charles Gibson, after Kerry said he would not “go it alone like this president did” in Iraq.

<p>“I’ve got to answer this,” said Bush, jumping off his stool and turning to Kerry. “You tell Tony Blair we’re going alone! It denigrates an alliance to say we’re going it alone, to discount their sacrifices.”

<p>About a half hour into the debate, Bush joked about his behaviour. “That answer almost made me want to scowl,” he said of a comment by Kerry on nuclear weapons, Iran and North Korea. The audience did not laugh.

<p>David Niven, a political scientist at Florida Atlantic University, described Bush as “wound a bit too tight. He was a little like Nixon – sort of jumping out of his suit. He looked bad on the TV close-ups.”

<p>For others, Kerry was sometimes muddled. His response to a woman, who asked why her tax dollars should pay for abortion if she opposes it, was as convoluted as some of his views.

<p>After the debate, the candidates rushed back to campaigning. Each appeared that night at a rally in St Louis, a city in a conservative, fundamentalist state but with a large black Democratic-leaning minority. The state’s voters have sided with the victor in every presidential election since 1904, except for 1956.

<p>“How about two for two?” Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, said to a cheering crowd at America’s Centre. The candidate, ebullient, pumped his fist into the air.

<p>Yesterday, Bush was to campaign in Iowa and Minnesota, and Kerry travelled to Ohio and Florida. All are battleground states.

<p>An instant ABC News poll found that voters who tuned in on Friday picked Kerry as the winner by a narrower margin than the first debate. This time the quick poll showed 44% thought Kerry won, 41% Bush and 13% said a tie.

<p>They fared about equally in a similar poll by CNN-USA Today-Gallup. Asked who did a better job, 47% said Kerry and 45% said Bush.

<p>The day of the debate, rumours raced across the Internet: a TV shot of Bush, from the first debate, showed a rectangular bulge on the back of his jacket that could be a radio transmitter so he could receive prompts through an earpiece. The online magazine Salon.com ran the story on Friday. The New York Times yesterday reported that the White House said the TV footage had not been doctored but that the oblong “bulge” must be a “wrinkle in the fabric.” Such a device would be contrary to the debate rules hammered out through an independent commission.

<p>Cameras were said to have been ordered not to show candidates from the back, although the Fox TV camera did.

<p>Bush is prone to malapropisms. During Fr iday’s debate, he mistakenly called Kerry “Kennedy” and asked the moderator if “his clock was up” when he wondered if he had more time to respond.

<p>The last week has been embarrassing for Bush. A report, by the US’s Iraq Survey Group, rejected the notion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

<p>As well as Iraq, Friday’s debate also highlighted the candidates’ differences on health costs, abortion, stem-cell research and taxes.

<p>Kerry slammed Bush as the first president since the Great Depression to preside over job losses and wartime tax cuts for the richest 1%. Earlier that day, the US Labour Department issued weak figures on jobs gains, its final report before the November 2 vote.

<p>The Massachusetts senator, asked if he would pledge not to raise taxes on those who make less than £110,000 , turned and walked to camera. “Absolutely yes. Right into the camera. I am not going to raise taxes,” he said . It was a line reminiscent of the promise made by Bush’s father, President George Bush Sr, which he would later break: “Read my lips: no new taxes.”

<p>“Of course he will raise your taxes,” said the current president irritably. He told voters they need only look at Kerry’s votes in Washington for evidence that he will raise taxes to cover what Bush says is $2.2 trillion in spending pledges.

<p>“That’s just reality,” he said to the audience, assembled in the gym of St Louis’s Washington University. “He’s got a record. He’s been there 20 years. You can run but you can’t hide.”

<p>But when Bush denigrated his opponent as a liberal Kerry was ready. “The president is just trying to scare everybody here by throwing labels around. I mean ‘compassionate conservative?’ What does that mean? Cutting 500,000 kids from after school programmes? Cutting 365,000 kids from health care? Running up the biggest deficits in history?“

<p>“Mr President,” he said, swivelling to face Bush . “You’re batting 0 for 2. I mean, seriously, labels don’t mean anything.”

<p>Wednesday’s final debate, in Arizona, focuses on domestic issues, an agenda that could help put a dampener on Bush’s aggressive style.
