At this point, a vote for Dennis Kucinich is a vote for John Kerry to move to the left, the long-shot Democratic presidential candidate and his supporters said Friday. 
<p> 
The Ohio congressman visited several Boulder venues throughout the day, encouraging people to send a message to the Democratic party by supporting him in the state's caucus Tuesday, even though Kerry has essentially secured the party's nomination. 

 <p> 

 
"Iowa and New Hampshire decided the nomination, but Colorado has the chance to decide the direction of the Democratic Party," Kucinich told the crowd at a sold-out Vox Feminista stage performance at the Dairy Center for the Arts. "My candidacy is about providing a backbone for the Democratic party." 
<p> 
After speaking of his proposals for a Department of Peace, a nonprofit health-care system and equitable trade, Kucinich received a standing ovation from the crowd and a hug from Vox Feminista performer "Oak." 
<p> 
"Are you really a politician?" she asked. 
<p> 
Patrick West, state coordinator for the Kucinich campaign, said Kerry will look to woo the political right if those on the left don't make themselves heard. 
<p> 
"If we go to our caucus on April 13 and stand up for what we believe in ... we let them know that we are out there and they better start reaching out to us," West said. 
<p> 
Boulder residents Evan Eisentrager and Shoba Rajgopal said they support Kucinich for exactly that reason. 
<p> 
"We know that he won't last until the end and we'll vote for Kerry," Rajgopal said. "But we want to move Kerry in a more progressive direction." 
<p> 
Leaving the Dairy Center to make his final local appearance before a Motet concert at the Fox Theater, Kucinich said he chose the entertainment venues because of the crowds they attract. 
<p> 

"We need to embrace culturally creative people because they're the ones who are helping to create a new America — an America that's peaceful, creative and fun," Kucinich said. 
<p> 
He said he didn't have a specific plan for how he would get his message out after the Democratic nomination is officially decided, but will continue pushing for peace and health-care reform. 
<p> 
"Mine is a lifetime commitment," he said. "It wasn't just about this election."
