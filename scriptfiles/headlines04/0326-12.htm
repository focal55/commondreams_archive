<p>DETROIT  - Presidential candidate John Kerry,  eager to rebut charges that he is a tax-and-spend Democrat, on  Friday proposed cutting the corporate tax rate and paying for  it by eliminating incentives for U.S. companies to shift jobs  overseas.<p> 
			
			In the battleground state of Michigan, hit hard by the  flight of manufacturing work to other countries and suffering  from an unemployment rate of 6.6 percent -- a full point above  the national average -- Kerry offered an economic trade-off he  said would help create 10 million jobs in four years.<p>

He pledged to end a tax provision that lets companies defer  paying U.S. taxes on income earned by foreign subsidiaries and  said he would use the $12 billion in annual savings to fully  fund a 5 percent cut in corporate rates.<p> 
			
			"Today we have a tax code that does more to reward  companies for moving overseas than it does to reward them for  creating jobs here in America," Kerry said in a speech at Wayne  State University.<p> 
			
			The proposal, one piece of a broader job-creation package  to be unveiled over the next few weeks, amounted to "a simple  tax cut" for the 99 percent of American companies that did not  send jobs overseas, according to Kerry economic adviser Gene  Sperling.<p> 
			
			It comes when President Bush and his Republican allies are  portraying the four-term Massachusetts senator as one of the  main opponents of tax relief in Congress who has voted more  than 350 times for increases.<p> 
			
			"This is nothing but a reshuffling of the tax code and a  political shell game," White House spokesman Scott McClellan  said.<p> 
			
			Kerry called his plan the most sweeping reform of  international tax law in 40 years. Sperling cited it as  evidence that the senator "has always been a pro-growth,  pro-jobs Democrat."<p> 
			
			"Some may be surprised to hear a Democrat calling for lower  corporate tax rates," Kerry said. "The fact is, I don't care  about the old debates. I care about getting the job done and  here in the United States of America."<p> 
			
			MICHIGAN A KEY BATTLEGROUND<p> 
			
			Michigan, home to the automobile industry, is a key  battleground in the Nov. 2 presidential election. In 2000,  Democrat Al Gore won the state by five percentage points over  Bush.<p> 
			
			Under existing law, U.S. companies do not have to pay taxes  on foreign income until they bring it back to the United  States. If they keep it abroad, they can avoid taxes entirely.<p> 
			
			Kerry's plan would tax profits from foreign subsidiaries  just like domestic profits. It would still allow companies to  defer the income earned by production overseas if they are  serving foreign markets.<p> 
			
			The $12 billion saved would pay for a cut in corporate tax  rates, to 33.25 percent from 35 percent.<p> 
			
			Kerry's plan would expand a proposal for manufacturing job  tax credits to include industries that the Commerce and Labor  Departments determined to be at risk of being outsourced.<p> 
			
			It would offer a one-year, 10 percent tax holiday to  encourage companies that are keeping profits overseas to avoid  taxes to bring them back to the United States.<p> 
			
			The Detroit speech was the first of three Kerry will  deliver in the next few weeks on his plans to create jobs. The  second will focus on jobs tied to energy and other technology,  while the third will outline efforts to restore U.S. fiscal  discipline and economic confidence.<p> 
			
			Kerry, who has promised to cut the budget deficit in half  during his first term, says he will soon release a complete  economic plan with a full breakdown of the figures he is using.
			<p> 
			
			He has vowed to repeal Bush's tax cuts for Americans  earning more than $200,000 a year, create new tax breaks for  the middle class, pay for a health-care plan costing $72  billion a year and increase spending on a variety of programs.
