<p>LONDON - Former British minister Clare Short
accused Prime Minister Tony Blair  Thursday of making political
mistakes over Iraq  and failing to prepare for the aftermath of
war.
<p>
 Her remarks, the latest in a series of attacks on her
former boss, came as Blair prepares a key speech on security
and war in the Gulf.
<p>
 Short, Britain's former international development
secretary, caused a storm last week by saying Britain spied on
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan  ahead of the war and has
accused Blair of misleading Britons about the need for military
action.
<p>
 She returned to the fray in Catholic journal The Tablet on
Thursday.
"The deceit on the road to war and the deliberate
marginalization of the U.N. led to an unforgivable failure to
prepare for the aftermath of the inevitable speedy victory,"
said Short, who resigned from government after the war.
<p>
 "The significant mistakes in Iraq were political -- not
intelligence mistakes," she wrote, arguing the U.S. set a date
for war with which Britain went along.
<p>
 The prime minister's trust ratings have plunged since the
U.S.-led war in Iraq last March and he has failed to shift the
political debate to vital domestic issues ahead of elections
expected next year.
<p>
 Blair was cleared of exaggerating the intelligence used as
a basis for war by an independent inquiry in January, but
related issues continue to surface.
<p>
 Campaign group Greenpeace said it was seeking to legally
force the British government's top lawyer to appear as a
witness next week at the trial of 14 opponents of the Iraq war.
<p>
 Opponents accuse the attorney general of swallowing his
doubts to give the government legal cover after it failed to
gain U.N. backing for a second resolution authorizing the war.
<p>
 Critics want his full advice published, a move the
government has flatly rejected.
<p>
 Short said while it was clear Iraq had obstructed and
deceived U.N. inspectors, "the general view was that we needed
to deal with Iraq, but there was no immediate danger."
<p>
 A wave of bomb attacks in Baghdad and Kerbala killing at
least 171 people earlier this week has highlighted the
difficulties in rebuilding the country and restoring peace.
<p>
 But Blair, speaking after a meeting in Rome with his
Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi, said the recent surge in
violence in Iraq did not constitute civil war.
<p>
 Faced with a failure to find weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq, Blair has sought to broaden the argument for war and his
official spokesman acknowledged Thursday there was no chance of
the issue being buried soon.
<p>
 "The issue of Iraq is clearly going to continue to provoke
comment and will be a focus in the run-up to the handover of
power in Iraq," planned for June 30, the spokesman said.
<p>
 He said Blair would address weapons proliferation and
security issues in a speech in his northern England
constituency Friday.</p>
