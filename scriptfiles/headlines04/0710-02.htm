<p>LONDON - The ruling by the International Court of Justice in 
The Hague that the ”security wall” Israel is building in the West Bank is 
illegal marks a major victory for Palestinians.
<p>
                  
The ruling is not binding. Officially it is termed only an ”advisory 
opinion” offered by the court. Israeli officials briefing media while the 
court was delivering its opinion declared the judgment would find its way 
to the ”garbage can of history.”
<p>
But the ”advisory opinion” marks a major moral and diplomatic win for 
Palestinians. And it further weakens the diplomatic case both of Israel 
and the United States.
<p>
The decision will bring a significant setback to the United States in the 
Arab world; a U.S. judge was the only one among 15 who delivered a 
contrary opinion.
<p>
That the U.S. judge Thomas Buergenthal was acting as American rather than 
as judge became evident from the immediate dismissal of the judgment by 
the White House. The White House spokesman Scott McClellan said The Hague 
was not the ”appropriate forum” to decide this issue. Britain backed the 
U.S. position.
<p>
The legal ruling took on immediate diplomatic color as a result. Israeli 
justice minister Yosef Lapid told Army Radio before the ruling that the 
court in The Hague consisted of judges ”from the European Union who are 
not suspected of being particularly disposed towards Israel.”
<p>
The European Union (EU) takes a public stand far more supportive of 
Palestinians than the United States. The EU is the principal donor in the 
budget of the Palestinian Authority.
<p>
The Israeli argument that it was up against a court dominated by EU 
judges only underlines its diplomatic isolation. 
<p>
The ruling follows a decision by the Israeli High Court against the path 
of construction of the wall north of Jerusalem. That path is leaving many 
Palestinians sandwiched between the Green Line as the pre-1967 border is 
known, and the wall. Many other Palestinians are being left stranded 
outside and virtually cut off from Jerusalem.
<p>
But there is nothing else to stop Israelis building the 425-mile long 
wall in the West Bank. About 120 miles of the wall, at places actually a 
fence, has been completed. The Israelis say it is intended to keep 
suicide bombers out of Israel and that it has already demonstrated its 
success.
<p>
Court president Shi Jiuyong of China said construction of the wall ”would 
be tantamount to de facto annexation. That construction, along with 
measures previously taken, thus severely impeded the exercise by the 
Palestinian people of its right to self-determination.” 
<p>
The International Court of Justice gave its ruling after five months of 
deliberation. The UN General Assembly asked for an advisory opinion last 
December. 
<p>
The U.S. judge agreed with the others only to the extent that the court 
had a right to give an advisory opinion.
<p>
”In its opinion, the Court finds unanimously that it has jurisdiction to 
give the advisory opinion requested by the United Nations General 
Assembly and decides by 14 votes to one to comply with that request,” it 
said while giving its opinion. 
<p>
The court ruled that ”the construction of the wall being built by Israel, 
the occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in 
and around East Jerusalem, and its associated régime, are contrary to 
international law.”
<p>
The court declared, again in a 14:1 ruling: ”Israel is under an 
obligation to terminate its breaches of international law; it is under an 
obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being 
built in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around East 
Jerusalem, to dismantle forthwith the structure therein situated, and to 
repeal or render ineffective forthwith all legislative and regulatory 
acts relating thereto.”
<p>
The court added in its ruling that ”Israel is under an obligation to make 
reparation for all damage caused by the construction of the wall in the 
occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around East Jerusalem.” 
<p>
While the jurisdiction of the court was rejected by Israel and the United 
States, they will not find it easy to reject the reasoning of the court.
<p>
The advisory opinion is divided into three parts: jurisdiction and 
judicial propriety; legality of the construction, and legal consequences 
of the breaches found. 
<p>
The court ruled it had jurisdiction under the UN Charter, under which the 
General Assembly had authorized it to give its opinion.
<p>
The court ruled that ”Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defense or on 
a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the 
construction of the wall. The Court accordingly finds that the 
construction of the wall and its associated régime are contrary to 
international law.” 
<p>
The Court declared the construction illegal under the United Nations 
Charter and under ”the principles of the prohibition of the threat or use 
of force and the illegality of any territorial acquisition by such means, 
as reflected in customary international law.”
<p>
It further cited the principle of self-determination of peoples as 
enshrined in the Charter and reaffirmed by UN resolution 2625 (XXV).
<p>
The Court drew a distinction between the legal consequences of these 
violations for Israel and those for other states.
<p>
In regard to the former, the Court said Israel must ”put an end to the 
violation of its international obligations flowing from the construction 
of the wall in the occupied Palestinian territory and must accordingly 
cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall, dismantle 
forthwith those parts of that structure situated within the occupied 
Palestinian territory and forthwith repeal or render ineffective all 
legislative and regulatory acts adopted with a view to construction of 
the wall and establishment of its associated régime.”
<p>
As regards the legal consequences for other states, the court said ”all 
states are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation 
resulting from the construction of the wall and not to render aid or 
assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction.”
<p>
The court declared that ”the United Nations, and especially the General 
Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is 
required to bring to an end the illegal situation resulting from the 
construction of the wall and its associated régime, taking due account of 
the present advisory opinion.”
