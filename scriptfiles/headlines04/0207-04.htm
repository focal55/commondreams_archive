<p>SEATTLE  - Former U.S. ambassador to Iraq Joseph
Wilson said on Friday the White House's "brass knuckles" rebuke
to his public criticism of the Iraq war has left him more
defiant than ever and he is now actively campaigning to defeat
President Bush  in November's election.
<p>
 By allegedly exposing his wife as an undercover CIA 
operative in retaliation for a newspaper article questioning
the war, White House officials gave a glimpse of Washington
politics at its nastiest, Wilson told Reuters.
<p>
 "People who have been around Washington a lot longer than I
have say it's been unprecedented ... for an administration to
do what they did to my wife," Wilson said. "What they lack in
finesse they make up for in brass knuckles."
<p>
 A newspaper column by Robert Novak last summer quoted two
senior administration officials identifying Wilson's wife,
Valerie Plame, as a CIA officer.
<p>
 Her undercover status blown, Plame continues to work but
her status is uncertain, Wilson said in Seattle where he is
campaigning for Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, frontrunner for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
<p>
 "Clearly, her life has been turned upside down, because
she's still in this particular business and her career changes
as a consequence of this, but she continues to go to work and
do the best she can," Wilson said.
<p>
 The CIA sent Wilson to Niger in early 2002 to check a
report that Iraq had tried to buy "yellowcake" uranium there.
He found no evidence to support the report, which was later
found to be based partly on forged documents.
<p>
 But in his January 2003 State of the Union speech President
Bush cited an Iraq-Niger connection as evidence Saddam Hussein 
was trying to develop nuclear weapons.
<p>
 In a New York Times article last July, titled "What I
didn't find in Africa," Wilson accused the White House of
twisting intelligence to exaggerate Iraq's nuclear efforts.
<p>
 Bush last year called Plame's unmasking a "serious matter"
and urged his staff to cooperate with a Justice Department probe.
<p>
 "Whoever decided that his (Bush's) political agenda was
more important than the national security of our country is
still in place and still has the ear of the president," Wilson
said.
<p>
 Wilson has been a vocal critic of the Iraq war, saying
tight surveillance and intense espionage had already handcuffed
Saddam, who would likely have lost power eventually without the
invasion. More than 500 Americans have died in the war and
occupation so far.
