<p>STRASBOURG, France  - 

The European Union's
outgoing External Relations Commissioner, Chris Patten,
launched a withering attack on United States policy in Iraq 
Wednesday, saying the world deserved better than American
"testosterone."

<p>Renowned for his blunt speaking, Patten used his parting
speech to the European Parliament to deliver a stinging
rejection of what he depicted as the Bush administration's
go-it-alone approach and contempt for allies.
<p>The U.S.-led invasion to overthrow Saddam Hussein,  which
split the western alliance, had failed to bring peace to Iraq,
Israel or the Palestinians, he said.
<p>"Liberation rapidly turned into a brutally resisted
occupation. Democracy failed to roll out like an oriental
carpet across the thankless deserts of the Middle East," Patten
said.
<p>"Above all, peace in Jerusalem and Palestine was not
accomplished by victory in Baghdad," he said.
<p>Patten, a former chairman of Britain's Conservative party
and the last colonial governor of Hong Kong, leaves office at
the end of next month and will be returning to private life as
non-executive chancellor of Oxford University.
<p>Without mentioning President Bush by name, he said
"neo-conservative unilateralism" had clearly failed to
establish peace, liberty and democracy, forcing Washington to
bring allies and international institutions back into fashion.
<p>"Can we now look forward to the restoration of that
old-fashioned notion that allies have to be led, not bossed,
and that multilateral institutions have their important uses
even for the world's only superpower?" Patten asked.
<p><b>
 ELECTION RHETORIC</b>
<p>But he concluded that multilateralism was not yet accepted
on either side of the political divide in Washington, saying
the rhetoric of the U.S. presidential election campaign was
"pretty unsettling" -- although he insisted he was not taking
sides.
<p>"If you want to get a cheap cheer from certain quarters in
America it seems that all you have to do is to bash the U.N.,
or the French, or the very idea that allies are entitled to
have their own opinions," Patten said.
<p>"Multilateralists, we are told, want to out-source American
foreign and security policy to a bunch of garlic chewing,
cheese eating wimps," he said.
<p>Patten stressed that a joint approach to world problems was
in the best interests of the United States, as well as of
Europe, which was otherwise in danger of believing that sniping
at Washington was in itself a policy.
<p>"What I most worry about is that on either side of the
Atlantic, we will bring out the worst in our traditional
partners," he said. "The world deserves better than
testosterone on one side and superciliousness on the other."
