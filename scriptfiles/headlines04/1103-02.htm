      <p>BOSTON—A gospel choir belted out "God Bless America" as soggy Democratic 
        supporters tried to put a brave face on events in the early hours here 
        this morning.
      <P> </P>
      But by 1 a.m. it appeared all but inevitable that Republican presidential 
      candidate George W. Bush had won the election.
      <P> </P>
      "To me it doesn't look good," said Mary Beth Doyle, a Boston University 
      student. 
      <P> </P>
      "I've tried to stay optimistic. I'm not ready to give up just yet."
      <P> </P>
      Neither was the Democratic party. 
      <P> </P>

In a statement issued early this morning, as the vote teetered in Ohio, 
      a spokesperson said there were still 250,000 votes to be counted in that 
      state and the party believed that when they were counted they would win 
      Ohio.
      <P> </P>
      However, here, hope seemed to begin fading for most of the thousands gathered 
      early this morning in Boston's Copley Square, but they were not yet resigned 
      to a defeat for Democratic challenger John Kerry.
      <P> </P>
      Kerry was expected to address the crowd at some point but by shortly after 
      1 a.m. he had yet to do so.
      <P> </P>
      Earlier in the evening, Kerry supporters listened as the Lynn School Marching 
      Band played the "Star-Spangled Banner," 1970s chanteuse Carole King sang 
      "You've Got a Friend", and tens of thousands of Bostonians gathered in the 
      cold and drizzle last night, praying for a Kerry victory.
      <P> </P>
      A huge roar went up from the crowd at about 10 p.m. when results flashed 
      on the huge TV screens mounted in the city's historic Copley Plaza, showing 
      the Democratic presidential challenger leading in Pennsylvania.
      <P> </P>
      "I'm hoping to hear good news," said an anxious Patricia Valade, a nursing 
      supervisor from southern Massachusetts. "I'm staying till I hear the victory 
      speech. It could be a long while."
      <P> </P>
      Taking turns on an outdoor stage erected in front of Boston's elegant greystone 
      public library, a parade of Democratic luminaries and key Kerry supporters 
      all kept repeating the same sport-flavoured mantra as the night wore on.
      <P> </P>
      The New England Patriots won the football Super Bowl last year, they reminded 
      the crowd.
      <P> </P>
      And, last month, the Boston Red Sox broke an 86-year jinx and triumphed 
      in the baseball World Series.
      <P> </P>
      Now — the assorted speakers declared hopefully, one after another — John 
      Forbes Kerry, as Massachusetts' favourite son, was poised to carry off an 
      even greater prize, the presidency of the United States.
      <P> </P>
      "The Red Sox taught us to believe in the power of tenacity," said Boston 
      Mayor Tom Menino. "This is the most important election of our lifetime. 
      Hope is on the way."
      <P> </P>
      The Democratic candidate had begun the final day of the 2004 campaign in 
      Wisconsin, one of many swing states in which he had sought to sway undecided 
      voters.
      <P> </P>
      By late yesterday morning, he returned to Boston to spend the rest of the 
      day with key advisers and his family.
      <P> </P>
      According to Joe Lockhart, senior adviser to the Democratic campaign team, 
      Kerry had lunch yesterday at Boston's Union Oyster House, the same seafood 
      restaurant where he has dined while awaiting the results of every election 
      he has contested, including a 1982 run for lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, 
      followed by four successful campaigns for the U.S. Senate.
      <P> </P>
      Former U.S. president John F. Kennedy — Kerry's life-long political hero, 
      with whom he shares the same three initials — had lunch in the same restaurant 
      on voting day in 1960, when he triumphed over Richard Nixon and went on 
      to the White House.
      <P> </P>
      Forty-four years later, voters in this predominantly Democratic state were 
      hoping that history would repeat itself and were buoyed by reports of heavier 
      than usual turnout in many parts of the country, a pattern that traditionally 
      tends to favour a challenger rather than an incumbent.
      <P> </P>
      After the closest and most bitterly presidential race in many decades drew 
      to a close yesterday, the leading lights of the Democratic campaign converged 
      on Boston from scattered regions of the country to await the results.
      <P> </P>
      Democratic vice-presidential candidate John Edwards had spent much of the 
      day in the vital swing state of Florida, the state that determined the nation's 
      future in 2000, when Republican George W. Bush eked out a narrow and still 
      disputed victory in that presidential battle.
      <P> </P>
      Edwards later flew to Boston to join Kerry and other top party officials.
      <P> </P>
      Teresa Heinz Kerry, the Democratic candidate's wife, voted in Pittsburgh 
      early yesterday, before she, too, joined her husband in Boston.
      <P> </P>
      As they awaited an appearance by Kerry, a host of popular musicians entertained 
      the crowd that was gathered last night in Copley Square under overcast skies 
      and in brisk autumn temperatures.
      <P> </P>
      Bordered by a pair of centuries-old churches, including the Old South Church 
      — built in 1669 — Copley Square was filled to the bursting point, and an 
      overflow crowd shifted and hovered in the adjoining streets.
      <P> </P>
      Security was predictably tight, and no one was permitted into the square 
      without an official pass. 
      <P> </P>
      Uniformed security guards searched everyone who entered.
      <P> </P>
      Looming above the square was the handsome, seven-story greystone façade 
      of the Copley Plaza Hotel — officially, the Fairmont Copley Plaza — the 
      same hotel where Kerry's paternal grandfather took his own life on a cold 
      November morning in 1921.
      <P> </P>
      Last night, in the biting air of the New England fall, the crowd in Copley 
      Square cheered whenever results blazed out from the massive TV screens showing 
      positive results for Kerry.
      <P> </P>
      "This is a great day for democracy," Terry McAuliffe, chair of the Democratic 
      National Committee, told the crowd.
