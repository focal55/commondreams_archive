<p>BRUNSWICK, Ga.  — Eleven people arrested for protesting near the Group of Eight summit are refusing to give their names or post bail, hoping to bring attention to a legal system they consider corrupt, their lawyer says.

<p>The protesters, who remained in jail Monday, were charged with disorderly conduct last week for trying to cross a police barricade and block the road to Sea Island, site of the meeting of world leaders attending the G8 summit.

<p>The protesters, 10 men and a woman, range in age from 17 to 27.

<p>"They are persons of integrity and principle. They believe they did nothing wrong by exercising their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, assembly and petition," said their lawyer, Bill Cristman.

<p>Several of the protesters were not carrying identification when they were arrested, and some later refused to tell police who they were, leading to additional charges against them.

<p>A hearing is planned Thursday, when a court date will be set. Each of the misdemeanors is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
