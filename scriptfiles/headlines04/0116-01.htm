<!--/endimage/-->LOS ANGELES  - U.S. football fans will not see ads
featuring scantily clad vegetarians or a political attack on
President Bush  during February's Super Bowl after CBS said on
Thursday that advocacy advertisements were out of bounds on
professional football's biggest day.
<p>
 The network, over the years, has rejected dozens of
advertising proposals by advocacy groups, who argue that the
network only airs controversial messages that it agrees with.
<p>
 "We just want to be able to present our jiggly women," said
Lisa Lange, spokeswoman for <a href="http://www.peta.org" target="_new">People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals</a>, asking to join advertisers like beer brewers who has
boosted sales with images of scantily-clad women.
<p>
 Liberal group <a href="http://www.Moveon.org" target="_new">Moveon.org</a>, known for its Internet funding
power, told members this week that it hoped to have the first
political Super Bowl ad.
<p>
 But its hopes were dashed when CBS said the spot, which
asks "Guess who's going to pay off President Bush's &#36;1 trillion
deficit?" was an issue piece and could not run.
<p>
 In a letter, CBS told PETA that it would not run
advertisements on "controversial issues of public importance."
<p>
 CBS spokesman Dana McClintock said the policy had been in
place for years. "We have a policy against accepting advocacy
advertising," he added. CBS, a unit of Viacom Inc., does run
political advertising for and against candidates.
<p>
CBS came under criticism in November when it decided not to
run a two-part made-for-television movie, "The Reagans," after
conservatives complained that it was unflattering to former
president Ronald Reagan  and his wife, Nancy.
 <p>
 PETA spokeswoman Lange said that CBS's broadcast of
anti-smoking advertisements and even hamburger chain spots were
controversial, advocacy pieces, as well.
 <p>
 "In essence, CBS is saying we will air an advocacy ad if we
agree with the viewpoint," she said.
 <p>
 The PETA ad shows two scantily clad women snuggling up to a
meat-eating pizza delivery man. "Meat can cause impotence," the
screen reads after the rendezvous fails.
 <p>
 CBS also said the PETA spot raised "significant taste
concerns.
