      <p>This is truly the year of the amateur. It was mostly the unfamous and 
        unsung who organized the voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, 
        started and ran the grassroots (if well-funded) 527 committees like MoveOn.org, 
        wrote the blogs and conceived the websites that did what the traditional 
        media seldom did--such as probing deeply into Bush's personal history, 
        including his military service. And it is ordinary people who are now 
        leading the way in scrutinizing newfangled, secretive voting systems, 
        seeking to insure that a handful of corporations don't, accidentally or 
        deliberately, undermine electoral democracy. </p>
      <p> Tomorrow the first recount begins--in New Hampshire, of all places, 
        a state George Bush didn't even win. But in those areas where he did well, 
        sometimes the numbers look decidedly odd. In this case, the person who 
        got the ball rolling was one Ida Briggs, a longtime Michigan software 
        designer and database developer who did a statistical analysis of some 
        election results, and found them perplexing enough to trigger concerns 
        in her mind about the efficacy of the electronic vote tabulation system 
        used. </p>
      <p> What she found were striking anomalies--mostly in precincts using paper 
        ballots that were then input via the optical scanning machines manufactured 
        by the controversial vendor Diebold, of North Canton, Ohio. In general, 
        according to Briggs, the "Diebold precincts" showed larger and more frequent 
        deviations from expected voting trends than precincts relying strictly 
        on hand counts, and even than those using an optical-scan counting system 
        from another manufacturer. Creating trend patterns by looking at the 2000 
        and 2004 elections, she found rural, typically conservative precincts 
        that hand-counted ballots as voting more for Kerry than they did for Gore, 
        while larger, urban precincts using Diebold's AccuVote machines often 
        did the opposite. Of the precincts where Kerry did less well than expected, 
        according to Briggs, 73 percent used optical-scan technology and 62 percent 
        used Diebold machines. Fully 92 percent of all out-of-trend votes were 
        optically scanned. New Hampshire has 301 precincts; 126 of them use Diebold's 
        AccuVote technology. </p>
      <p> Referring to the recount advocates, a Diebold spokesman told the Associated 
        Press, "I think they're rushing to judgment." </p>
      <p> Briggs became interested in the numbers when, shortly after the election, 
        she saw a study published on the web about statistical anomalies in nonswing 
        states. New Hampshire caught her attention because of the sizable--15 
        percent--differential between early exit polls and results. It was easy 
        to study, because the state made its data available online. And because 
        New Hampshire was a state Kerry won, no one could claim that the goal 
        of a recount there was to change the election results. </p>
      <p> In the era of contracted-out services, companies like Diebold are given 
        unusual amounts of liberty to be self-policing. The problems emerge later, 
        if at all. Diebold has faced intense scrutiny and criticism over malfunctions 
        in its touch-screen voting machines, but it steadfastly insists that its 
        optical scanners have proven reliable during years of use. Diebold continues 
        to be one of several corporations with vast power over the levers of democracy. 
      </p>
      <p> Respected analysts have found numerous bugs in Diebold's system codes, 
        and complain that the company has failed to release its most recent revisions, 
        preventing an independent verification of improvements. The company drew 
        particular concern after Walden O'Dell, the Ohio-based company's chief 
        executive officer, penned a fundraising letter for Bush in which he declared 
        himself "committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the 
        president next year." And Diebold recently settled a civil suit brought 
        by the State of California alleging that the company sold the state and 
        several counties shoddy voting equipment. Diebold agreed to pay $2.6 million 
        to the state. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that Diebold intentionally 
        tampered with its software. </p>
      <p> Briggs is the first to admit that mathematics is a tricky game. "New 
        Hampshire might just be odd--this trend could really be happening," she 
        said. "It's unlikely, but it could be." If, indeed, the numbers are wrong, 
        it doesn't mean deliberate tampering. It could be a programming error, 
        which would be consistent with the fact that the unexpected results affected 
        only the first race on the ballot. In any case, that's what recounts are 
        for. </p>
      <p> Once Briggs's eyebrows were raised, she said, she tried contacting the 
        Kerry campaign to see if officials there would call for a recount. With 
        no affirmative response, on Friday, November 5, she called Ralph Nader--with 
        less than four hours remaining before New Hampshire's deadline for recount 
        requests. The Nader people didn't know Briggs, and were wary, but Air 
        America Radio host Randi Rhodes managed to mobilize enough listeners that 
        Nader soon had a twelve-inch stack of imploring faxes. With one minute 
        remaining to deadline, he faxed in a request for a recount. (He also agreed 
        to pay a $2,000 filing fee plus actual costs.) </p>
      <p> On Thursday, New Hampshire officials will begin a hand recount of paper 
        ballots in five of eleven large urban precincts--in Manchester and Litchfield--where 
        Bush did surprisingly well. The remaining precincts will be counted soon. 
        If the results prove interesting, recounts could be requested elsewhere 
        besides Ohio, where such a request has already been made by Green Party 
        presidential candidate David Cobb and Libertarian Party candidate Michael 
        Badnarik. </p>
      <p> Even a hand recount won't satisfy everyone--and shouldn't. The efficacy 
        of the American voting system is dependent on a lot of things going right--and 
        anecdotal evidence suggests many fruitful avenues of inquiry into things 
        that may have gone wrong. Among these: whether ballots were improperly 
        cast (fraud), and whether legitimate voters were prevented or discouraged 
        from voting. To say nothing of whether, in a country where many people 
        vote based on the most effective television commercials, people really 
        understand what they are voting on and the stakes involved. </p>
      <p> Kerry beat Bush in New Hampshire by 340,511 to 331,237 votes, a spread 
        of 50 percent to 49 percent, with Nader taking less than 1 percent. A 
        recount, even if it does establish problems, likely won't change the winner 
        in New Hampshire, and even if it does it will certainly not alter the 
        outcome of the presidential race. </p>
      <p> However, if it does show significant inaccuracies generated by the AccuVote 
        equipment and software, it could trigger recounts elsewhere--recounts 
        that could, theoretically, reverse the election. </p>
      <p> That's highly unlikely, given Bush's hefty wins in key states, and given 
        the prominent role of other voting technologies. But hand recounts of 
        optically scanned ballots will go a long way toward addressing doubts 
        about that technology and about the vendor. And it will perhaps give others 
        the confidence to request recounts when results go against statistical 
        trends, or common wisdom. At minimum, it will be a start on the road to 
        transparency and accountability. </p>
      <p> If it turns out that anomalies are just that, so be it. Then we need 
        to spend more time understanding why people voted--really, truly voted--the 
        way they did. </p>
