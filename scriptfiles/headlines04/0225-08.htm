<p>SAN FRANCISCO - A group of demonstrators assembled peacefully Tuesday outside the headquarters of Bechtel here, chanting slogans and holding signs to protest what they called the corporate takeover of Iraq.
<p>The protesters want the Bechtel Group, an engineering firm managing a $680 million contract to help rebuild Iraq, out of the war-torn country, saying it is profiting from the deaths of innocent people and taking jobs away from Iraqis.
<p>"This is an ongoing problem, this empire approach to world events," said Carl Anderson of Oakland. "We want to put an end to the corporate empire trying to run other countries."
<p>About 200 protesters met in front of Bechtel's headquarters at noon, where leaders of liberal activist groups, such as Code Pink, gave speeches and put on skits.
<p>Nate Dubhaigh of San Francisco wore a suit and pig mask as he wallowed in a trough of fake $100 bills to the delight of protesters.

<!--/endimage/-->"Let's go to war so we can make money," he yelled as he threw the bills into the air.
<p>Some Bechtel employees stood in front of their building, which was blocked off by a fence, as protesters began walking by chanting "Bechtel great big hawk; it's war for profit in Iraq."
<p>Anderson taunted one employee by trying to hand him a fake $100 bill. The man kept his arms crossed.
<p>"It's a souvenir," Anderson said.
<p>Ellen Edith, a cartoonist from Santa Cruz, held a pink umbrella that had pictures of President Bush in a pink dress hanging from each spoke.
<p>"Bush lied. Give him a pink slip," Edith said, echoing the words on her flyers. "He needs to be fired."
<p>San Francisco police did not make any arrests, and actually held back traffic as the peaceful crowd began marching up a busy Market Street until it reached One Post Plaza on Montgomery Street.
<p>"We're just here trying to protect the protesters, pedestrians and business owners," said Lt. Doug Groshong. "No problems at all."

<p>Jeff Grubler, one of the organizers of the protest, said he was angry with how the U.S. government has handled the situation in Iraq.

<p>"We haven't found weapons of mass destruction. We haven't found connections to al-Qaida. But we have found huge profits with companies like Bechtel," Grubler said.

<p>Grubler announced at the end of the demonstration that another protest on March 19 will take place at the Justin Herman Plaza.

<p>"We're going to end war profiteering," he yelled.
