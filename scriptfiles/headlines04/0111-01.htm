<p> If anyone would listen to him, Paul O'Neill thought, Dick Cheney would. 
The 
two had served together during the Ford Administration, and now as the 
Treasury Secretary fought a losing battle against another round of tax 
cuts, 
he figured that his longtime colleague would give him a hearing. 
<P>

</table>O'Neill had 
been preaching that a fiscal crisis was looming and more tax cuts would 
exacerbate it. But others in the White House saw a chance to capitalize 
on the 
historic Republican congressional gains in the 2002 elections. Surely, 
Cheney 
would not be so smug. He would hear O'Neill out. In an economic meeting 
in the 
Vice President's office, O'Neill started pitching, describing how the 
numbers 
showed that growing budget deficits threatened the economy. Cheney cut 
him 
off. "Reagan proved deficits don't matter," he said. O'Neill was too 
dumbfounded to respond. Cheney continued: "We won the midterms. This is 
our 
due."
<P>
A month later, Paul O'Neill was fired, ending the rocky two-year tenure 
of 
Bush's first Treasury Secretary, who became known for his candid 
statements 
and the controversies that followed them. Rarely had a person who spoke 
so 
freely been embedded so high in an Administration that valued frank 
public 
remarks so little.
<P>
Now O'Neill is speaking with the same bracing style in a book written 
by 
Pulitzer prizewinning journalist Ron Suskind. <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743255453/commondreams-20" target="_new">The Price of Loyalty: 
George W. 
Bush, the White House and the Education of Paul O'Neill </a></i>traces the 
former 
Alcoa CEO's rise and fall through the Administration: from his return 
to 
Washington to work for his third President, whom he believed would 
govern from 
the sensible center, through O'Neill's disillusionment, to his firing, 
executed in a surreal conversation with Cheney, a man he once 
considered a 
fellow traveler. Suskind had access not only to O'Neill but also to the 
saddlebags he took with him when he left town, which included a 
minute-by-minute accounting of his 23 months in office and 19,000 pages 
of 
documents on CD-ROM.

<P>So, what does O'Neill reveal? According to the book, ideology and 
electoral 
politics so dominated the domestic-policy process during his tenure 
that it 
was often impossible to have a rational exchange of ideas. The 
incurious 
President was so opaque on some important issues that top Cabinet 
officials 
were left guessing his mind even after face-to-face meetings. Cheney is 
portrayed as an unstoppable force, unbowed by inconvenient facts as he 
drives 
Administration policy toward his goals.
<P>
O'Neill's tone in the book is not angry or sour, though it prompted a 
tart 
response from the Administration. "We didn't listen to him when he was 
there," 
said a top aide. "Why should we now?"
<P>
But the book is blunt, and in person O'Neill can be even more so. 
Discussing 
the case for the Iraq war in an interview with TIME, O'Neill, who sat 
on the 
National Security Council, says the focus was on Saddam from the early 
days of 
the Administration. He offers the most skeptical view of the case for 
war ever 
put forward by a top Administration official. "In the 23 months I was 
there, I 
never saw anything that I would characterize as evidence of weapons of 
mass 
destruction," he told TIME. "There were allegations and assertions by 
people. 
<P>
But I've been around a hell of a long time, and I know the difference 
between 
evidence and assertions and illusions or allusions and conclusions that 
one 
could draw from a set of assumptions. To me there is a difference 
between real 
evidence and everything else. And I never saw anything in the 
intelligence 
that I would characterize as real evidence." A top Administration 
official 
says of the wmd intelligence: "That information was on a need-
to-know basis. He wouldn't have been in a position to see it."
<P>
From his first meeting with the President, O'Neill found Bush unengaged 
and 
inscrutable, an inside account far different from the shiny White House 
brochure version of an unfailing leader questioning aides with 
rapid-fire 
intensity. The two met one-on-one almost every week, but O'Neill says 
he had 
trouble divining his boss's goals and ideas. Bush was a blank slate 
rarely 
asking questions or issuing orders, unlike Nixon and Ford, for whom 
O'Neill 
also worked. "I wondered from the first, if the President didn't know 
the 
questions to ask," O'Neill says in the book, "or if he did know and 
just not 
want to know the answers? Or did his strategy somehow involve never 
showing 
what he thought? But you can ask questions, gather information and not 
necessarily show your hand. It was strange." In larger meetings, Bush 
was 
similarly walled off. Describing top-level meetings, O'Neill tells 
Suskind 
that during the course of his two years the President was "like a blind 
man in 
a roomful of deaf people."
<P>
In his interview with TIME, O'Neill winces a little at that quote. He's 
worried it's too stark and now allows that it may 
just be Bush's style to keep his advisers always guessing. In Suskind's 
book, 
O'Neill's assessment of Bush's executive style is a harsh one: it is 
portrayed 
as a failure of leadership. Aides were left to play "blind man's 
bluff," 
trying to divine Bush's views on issues like tax policy, global warming 
and 
North Korea. Sometimes, O'Neill says, they had to float an idea in the 
press 
just to scare a reaction out of him. This led to public humiliation 
when the 
President contradicted his top officials, as he did Secretary of State 
Colin 
Powell on North Korea and Environmental Protection Agency administrator 
Christine Todd Whitman on global warming. O'Neill came to believe that 
this 
gang of three beleaguered souls&#151;only Powell remains&#151;who shared a more 
nonideological approach were used for window dressing. We "may have 
been 
there, in large part, as cover," he tells Suskind.
<P>
If the President was hard to read, the White House decision-making 
process was 
even more mysterious. Each time O'Neill tried to gather data, sift 
facts and 
insert them into the system for debate, he would find discussion 
sheared off 
before it could get going. He tried to build fiscal restraint into 
Bush's tax 
plan but was thwarted by those who believed, as he says, that "tax cuts 
were 
good at any cost." He was losing debates before they had begun. The 
President 
asked for a global-warming plan one minute and then while it was being 
formulated, announced that he was reversing a campaign pledge to cut 
carbon 
dioxide emissions and pulling out unceremoniously from the Kyoto 
global-
warming treaty, short-circuiting his aides' work. The President was 
"clearly 
signing on to strong ideological positions that had not been fully 
thought 
through," says O'Neill. As for the appetite for new ideas in the White 
House, 
he told Suskind, "that store is closed."
<P>
To grope his way out of the wilderness, O'Neill turned to his old 
friends from 
the Ford Administration, Alan Greenspan and Dick Cheney. According to 
the 
book, Greenspan agreed with many of his proposals but could not do much 
from 
his Delphian perch. When O'Neill sought guidance from the Vice 
President about 
how to install a system that would foster vigorous and transparent 
debate, he 
got grumbles and silence but little sympathy. Soon O'Neill concluded 
that his 
powerful old colleague was rowing in a different direction."I realized 
why 
Dick just nodded along when I said all of this, over and over, and 
nothing 
ever changed," he says in the book. "This is the way Dick likes it."
<P>
Where ideology did not win, electoral politics did. Overruling many of 
his 
advisers, the President decided to impose tariffs on imported steel to 
please 
voters in key swing states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. 
<P>
When the 
corporate scandals rocked Wall Street, O'Neill and Greenspan devised a 
plan to 
make CEOs accountable. Bush went with a more modest plan because "the 
corporate crowd," as O'Neill calls it in the book, complained loudly 
and Bush 
could not buck that constituency. "The biggest difference between then 
and 
now," O'Neill tells Suskind about his two previous tours in Washington, 
"is 
that our group was mostly about evidence and analysis, and Karl (Rove), 
Dick 
(Cheney), Karen (Hughes) and the gang seemed to be mostly about 
politics. It's 
a huge distinction."
<P>
A White House that seems to pick an outcome it wants and then marshal 
the 
facts to meet it seems very much like one that might decide to remove 
Saddam 
Hussein and then tickle the facts to meet its objective. That's the 
inescapable conclusion one draws from O'Neill's description of how 
Saddam was 
viewed from Day One. Though O'Neill is careful to compliment the cia 
for 
always citing the caveats in its findings, he describes a White House 
poised 
to overinterpret intelligence. "From the start, we were building the 
case 
against Hussein and looking at how we could take him out and change 
Iraq into 
a new country," he tells Suskind. "And, if we did that, it would solve 
everything. It was about finding a way to do it. That was the tone of 
it. The 
President saying, 'Fine. Go find me a way to do this.'"
<P>
Cheney helped bring O'Neill into the Administration, acting as a 
shoehorn for 
O'Neill, who didn't know the President but trusted the wise counselor 
beside 
him. So it was perhaps fitting that Cheney would take O'Neill out. 
Weeks after 
Bush had assured O'Neill that rumored staff changes in the economic 
team did 
not mean his job was in peril, Cheney called. "Paul, the President has 
decided 
to make some changes in the economic team. And you're part of the 
change," he 
told O'Neill. The bloodless way he was cut loose by his old chum 
shocked 
O'Neill, Suskind writes, but what came after was even more shocking. 
Cheney 
asked him to announce that it was O'Neill's decision to leave 
Washington to 
return to private life. O'Neill refused, saying "I'm too old to begin 
telling 
lies now."
<P>
Suskind's book&#151;informed by interviews with officials other than 
O'Neill&#151;is 
only a partial view of the Bush White House. Bush's role on key topics 
like 
education, stem-cell research and aids funding is not explored. Bush's 
role as 
a military leader after 9/11 is discussed mostly through O'Neill's 
effort to 
stop terrorist funding. Bush comes across as mildly effective and 
pleased with 
O'Neill's work. The book does not try to cover how Bush engaged with 
his war 
cabinet during the Afghan conflict or how his leadership skills were 
deployed 
in the making of war. On the eve of the Iraq war, however, O'Neill does 
tell 
Suskind that he marvels at the President's conviction in light of what 
he 
considers paltry evidence: "With his level of experience, I would not 
be able 
to support his level of conviction."
<P>
There is no effort to offer an opposing analysis of O'Neill's portrayal 
of his 
tenure. The book lists his gaffes&#151;he ridiculed Wall Street traders, 
accused 
Democrats of being socialists and disparaged business lobbyists who 
were 
seeking a tax credit that the President supported&#151;but it portrays 
these 
moments as examples of brave truth telling in a town that doesn't like 
it. 
White House aides have a different view: It wasn't just that O'Neill 
was 
impolitic, they say; his statements had real consequences&#151;roiling 
currency 
markets and Wall Street. What O'Neill would call rigor, Bush officials 
say, 
was an excessive fussiness that led to policy gridlock and sniping 
within the 
economic team.
<P>
O'Neill says he hopes that straight talk about the broken 
decision-making 
process in the White House will highlight the larger political and 
ideological 
warfare that has gripped Washington and kept good ideas from becoming 
law. 
Perhaps naively or arrogantly, or both, he even believes it may help 
change 
the climate. Ask him what he hopes the book will accomplish, and he 
will talk 
about Social Security reform in earnest tones: tough choices won't be 
made in 
Washington so long as it shuns honest dialogue, bipartisanship and 
intellectual thoroughness. O'Neill may not have been cut out for this 
town, 
but give him this: he does exhibit the sobriety and devotion to ideas 
that are 
supposed to be in vogue in the postironic, post-
9/11 age.
<P>
Loyalty is perhaps the most prized quality in the White House. In the 
book, 
O'Neill suggests a very dark understanding of what happens to those who 
don't 
show it. "These people are nasty and they have a long memory," he tells 
Suskind. But he also believes that by speaking out even in the face of 
inevitable White House wrath, he can demonstrate loyalty to something 
he 
prizes: the truth. "Loyalty to a person and whatever they say or do, 
that's 
the opposite of real loyalty, which is loyalty based on inquiry, and 
telling 
someone what you really think and feel&#151;your best estimation of the 
truth 
instead of what they want to hear." That goal is worth the price of 
retribution, O'Neill says. Plus, as he told Suskind, "I'm an old guy, 
and I'm 
rich. And there's nothing they can do to hurt me."
