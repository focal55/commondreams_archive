<p>BERKELEY</span> &#8211; The Iraq war is not 
        winnable, a secret U.S. military unit has been "disappearing" people 
        since December 2001, and America has no idea how irreparably its torture 
        of Iraqis at Abu Ghraib prison has damaged its image in the Middle East. 
        These were just a few of the grim pronouncements made by Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning 
        investigative reporter Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Hersh to KQED host Michael 
        Krasny before a Berkeley audience on Friday night (Oct. 8). </p>
       <p>The past two years will "go down as one of the classic sort of failures" 
        in history, said the man who has been called the "greatest muckraker 
        of all time" and (paradoxically) the "<em>enfant terrible</em> of journalism 
        for more than 30 years." While Hersh blamed the White House and the Pentagon 
        for the Iraq quagmire and America's besmirched world image, he was stymied 
        by how it all happened. "How could eight or nine neoconservatives come 
        and take charge of this government?" he asked. "They overran the bureaucracy, 
        they overran the Congress, they overran the press, and they overran the 
        military! So you say to yourself, How fragile <em>is</em> this democracy?"</p>
