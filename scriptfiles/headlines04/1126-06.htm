Following a meeting at the Baghdad home of Adnan Pachachi,  an influential, moderate Sunni leader and former presidential  candidate, 15 political parties and groups signed a petition  calling for the election to be put off for up to six months.<p> 
			
			"The participants call for elections to be delayed and to  be held within six months, allowing for changes in the security  situation and completion of necessary arrangements in terms of  organization and administration," the petition read.<p> 
			
			Three interim government ministers attended the meeting and  representatives from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and  the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) signed the petition.<p> 
			
			A delegate from the Iraqi National Accord, headed by Prime  Minister Iyad Allawi, attended but did not sign.<p> 
			
			President Bush in Crawford, Texas, said he wanted the vote  as scheduled.<p> 
			
			"In terms of Iraq, the Iraqi Election Commission has  scheduled elections in January, and I would hope they'd go  forward in January," Bush said.<p> 
			
			Significantly, no representatives of the country's two main  Shi'ite parties, Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic  Revolution in Iraq, were present. Their absence highlighted  division in the country on religious lines between Shi'ite and  Sunni Muslims.<p> 
			
			Most Shi'ites, who make up about 60 percent of Iraq's  population, are eager for early elections. Oppressed during  Saddam Hussein's rule, they are eager to cement the increased  political power they have gained since his overthrow.<p> 
			
			The call for postponement comes amid mounting violence,  particularly in Sunni Muslim areas to the north and west of  Baghdad, and follows calls from influential Sunni religious and  political groups for the poll to be postponed.<p> 
			
			British security firm Global Risk Strategies said four of  its employees were killed and about 15 wounded in a mortar  attack on the heavily defended Green Zone on Thursday.<p> 
			
			In recent weeks, the Muslim Clerics' Association, a group  of senior Sunni scholars, has called for a boycott of the poll.  And the Iraqi Islamic Party, the country's main Sunni party,  which also attending the meeting and signed the petition, has  said it will boycott the elections if they go ahead as planned.<p> 
			
			In the wake of the U.S.-led offensive on the Sunni city of  Falluja, and fighting in Sunni-dominant towns such as Samarra,  Baquba, Tikrit and areas around Baghdad, the parties argue that  there is not enough time to arrange free and fair elections.<p> 
			
			Iraq's interim constitution says elections must be held by  the end of January to choose a parliament that will select a  new cabinet and oversee the writing of a permanent  constitution.<p> 
			
			Pachachi's backing for an election postponement is  significant.<p> 
			
			The Sunni politician is seen as an Iraqi elder statesman  and is closely allied to Washington. He was the preferred  choice of the United Nations for the Iraqi presidency, but the  post went instead to Ghazi al-Yawar, a Sunni tribal leader.<p> 
			
			The participation of the Kurds is also significant. Not  only are they close to the United States, but Kurdish regional  elections, a chance for the parties to show their strength and  influence, were due to be held on Jan. 30 as well.<p> 
			
			GREEN ZONE ATTACK<p> 
			
			The push for a postponement came amid persistent violence  across central and northern Iraq, with insurgents even managing  to strike inside the most protected area of Iraq, the heavily  fortified Green Zone, home to the interim government.<p> 
			
			London-based firm Global Risk Strategies, reporting the  death of four staff in an attack on the Green Zone, gave no  further information on the incident or nationalities of the  casualties. Coalition sources said they were believed to be  Nepalese Gurkhas, hundreds of whom work for Global in Iraq.<p> 
			
			The Green Zone, a sprawling complex surrounded by blast  walls, is attacked by mortars or rockets regularly, although  most attacks cause little damage.<p> 
			
			Two loud explosions echoed from the area on Thursday and  thick black smoke was seen rising above the compound.<p> 
			
			Global employs more than 1,000 security personnel in Iraq  and Afghanistan, protecting installations such as Baghdad's  international airport.<p>
