<p>WELLSBURG, W.Va. -- On the morning of Lance Corporal Michael J. Smith Jr.'s funeral, as his casket journeyed from Reasners Funeral Home across the Ohio River to Grace Lutheran Church,  television screens flashed green images not seen in the year since President Bush stood on the  USS Abraham Lincoln and declared, &quot;In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.&quot;</p>
<p>The images were night bombing photos from Fallujah, where US warplanes were dropping bombs not far from where Smith had been killed April 17. Tiny bursts of white exploded on the screen while reporters said  prayers could be heard in the city's mosques.</p>
<p>In the Family Dollar discount store on Route 2, Beulah Brown looked at her friend Isabelle Kocher and said: &quot;What we saw this morning -- it's really bad over there. It's getting really bad.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Corner Lunch, John Fox, who joined the Air Force back in 1958, looked at three fellow retirees and  said, &quot;They're doing today what they should have done two weeks ago -- take out that whole town, that whole 'Fallu' over there.&quot;</p>
<p>Outside, the people of Wellsburg began lining Route 2, already festooned with yellow ribbons, to wait for the funeral procession as it rolled back through town to Kadesh cemetery. John Paugh, 21, who had served with Smith as a volunteer firefighter before the invasion of Iraq, sat in a rescue squad van and expressed his disgust for Bush. &quot;I just don't believe anymore in what he's doing over there,&quot; Paugh said.</p>
<p>The war that Bush and many of his countrymen thought had come to an easy end a year ago has not. That point was driven home with the deepest pain in the hometowns of  136 soldiers  in April alone. Wellsburg, where residents have turned sharply against Bush over his handling of the war, is one such town.</p>
<p>Across the nation, a slender majority in most polls answers Bush's call to stay the course in Iraq. But behind the shaky wall of resolve, explosive feelings are starting to come out, like those tiny bursts of white against the green night-vision screen.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>&quot;If they'd have let me do my job the first time, that boy wouldn't be dead,&quot;  said Samuel Lee Miller, a third-generation veteran who served in the  Second Armored Division in the Gulf War. He recently changed his party registration to oppose Bush.</p>
<p>One town over in Wheeling, where Smith was born 21 years ago, Richard J. Seals sat at a community meeting and ticked off the names of his friends killed in Vietnam: &quot;There were 58,219 guys there killed for nothing. It's the same thing now. They hate our guts. They don't even want us there.&quot;</p>
<p>But across the room, Sheril Brambach responded fiercely: &quot;You ask me, we should blow that whole side of the map off.&quot;</p>
<p>Wheeling, and its neighboring suburb of Wellsburg, are river towns in the long-depressed Ohio Valley cutting through Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. Once a factory town, making cigars, furniture, cloth, dinnerware, light fixtures, decorative tiles, vases, steel girders, and beer bottles, Wheeling now is home to a regional medical center and fledgling tourist industry. The city is encouraging people to restore their Victorian-era homes to help attract sightseers.</p>
<p>All three states whose borders meet near Wheeling will be crucial to the outcome of the 2004 presidential election. And all of the nearby counties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia are considered swing regions within swing states, capable of supporting either party.</p>
<p>Few dispute that the economy  in the valley is worse than when Bush took office, although  it has been bad for long enough that people do not expect quick fixes. Bush's imposition of tariffs on imported steel won him some supporters. Even though the tariffs have since been removed, some people talk about how the weakening dollar still may help the area's few remaining mills and coal mines fend off foreign competition, by making US products less expensive and imports more expensive.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, people in Wheeling generally assume that the economy works in favor of the presumptive Democratic nominee, John F. Kerry,  while national security issues play for Bush.</p>
<p>On Monday, Kerry visited Wheeling for the first time, hoping to avoid the mistakes made four years ago by former Vice President Al Gore, who largely ignored West Virginia, which has a long history of backing Democrats, and lost the state to Bush by  six percentage points.</p>
<p>Kerry put on a hard hat and went down into the McElroy Mine. He came out vowing to be harder on foreign competition than he said Bush was: &quot;All of us can agree that all our trade agreements should be enforced, and they should be enforced tough.&quot;</p>
<p>But on the very day that it carried news of Kerry's visit, The Intelligencer, Wheeling's leading newspaper, also published an online poll asking area residents whether job creation or the war on terrorism was more important. They chose the war on terrorism, 57 percent to 43 percent.</p>
<p>That should be good news for Bush, who consistently runs ahead of Kerry in national polls as the candidate best equipped to protect the country. But it also comes at a moment of deep concern about Iraq, as many residents feel more willing than ever  to question Bush's handling of the war and to ask why it has not come out  the way he declared it had a year ago today.</p>
<p>On May 1, 2003, Bush flew 30 miles in a Navy jet to stage a dramatic landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln, bursting from the cockpit,  in the style of the movie &quot;Top Gun,&quot; in a flight suit. Later, he stood on the deck and declared victory in the  Iraq battle, saying, &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision, speed, and boldness that the enemy did not expect and the world had not seen before.&quot;</p>
<p>Bush did not declare an official end to the war, a decision reportedly made to avoid having to return 6,000 Iraqi prisoners under the Geneva Conventions. But the carrier speech, performed against the backdrop of a sign reading &quot;Mission Accomplished,&quot; came to symbolize Bush's perceived lack of preparation for what followed:  another year of fighting, with increasing intensity, culminating in more combat deaths in April of this year than in the entire war before Bush's speech.</p>
<p>&quot;This is hitting home,&quot; said Marcia Allen of Wellsburg on Wednesday. &quot;It's real close.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, West Virginia remains an unambiguously promilitary state, with many bases.  Most  people who criticized Bush did not question the rightness of the decision to go to war in Iraq.  Mostly, they faulted  Bush for poor planning and expressed fear that the long months of peacekeeping were exposing troops to unnecessary danger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who expressed support for Bush's handling of the Iraqi occupation<strong> </strong>also did so in the name of the troops. They describe the Iraqi insurgents as terrorists determined to bring down the United States. Despite the fact that Bush has acknowledged  no proof exists of a link between Iraq and the  attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, many of his supporters  think there was one.</p>
<p>&quot;This state sent more people per capita to World War II than any other, so when we're at war this state really unifies,&quot; Chuck Stump said. &quot;When we have a dog in the fight, we're going to back our guys.&quot;</p>
<p>Stump, who is in his 30s, sat in TJ's Sports Bar with three male friends of similar age. They acknowledged some unhappiness that the war did not end a year ago, but their disappointment was leavened with respect for Bush.</p>
<p>Charlie Dodd said &quot;certain people in Iraq&quot; were  responsible for the  Sept. 11 attacks, and  expressed anger at those who lack the will to retaliate: &quot;Memories in America are very short. It drives me nuts. Don't they remember the planes going into those towers?&quot;</p>
<p>For people in Wellsburg, the death of Michael J. Smith Jr., whose father, a retired state trooper, wore a  US Marine Corps cap around town every day to cheer on his son,<strong> </strong>has prompted a rigorous reassessment of the war. The younger Smith, who friends said was killed trying to save his sergeant in a gun battle near Fallujah,<strong> </strong>was in his second tour in Iraq.  He is survived by his pregnant wife. Most people in town initially were supportive of the war, but no longer. Grief has carved another hole in the valley.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a political thing, just like Vietnam,&quot; said James Van Camp, whose son, a Marine, is headed for Iraq. He said of the standoffs in Fallujah and Najaf: &quot;If they're going to do something, do it. Don't give them an inch. They'll take more positions and kill our boys. If we're not going to do something, bring them home.&quot;</p>
<p>In Advance Financial Savings Bank, customer service officer E. E. Elliott said, &quot;Saddam [Hussein] needed to go, but I always thought there was a hidden agenda&quot; in the Bush administration to take control of Iraqi oil fields.</p>
<p>As Elliott spoke, a sign flashed outside the bank: &quot;Lance Corporal Michael J. Smith Jr. An American Hero. God Bless His Family.&quot;</p>
<p>Similar signs were placed to greet the funeral  cortege as it passed the Subway sandwich shop, Tire America, and the Budweiser brewery before veering up into the hills over Wellsburg, past black cows grazing in fields, old frame houses with flags flying, and men on tractor mowers<strong>. </strong>At the hillside cemetery, a green tent awaited the mourners.</p>
<p>Before the cortege arrived, about a dozen Marines in white trousers practiced their rituals under the trembling blossoms and amid the headstones.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a good boy. I knew him since he was born,&quot; said Reva Guglielmotti as she awaited the arrival of the casket. &quot;Good family. And this is what he wanted to do.
