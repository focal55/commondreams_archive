<p>Accusing President Bush of having a "sweetheart relationship" with 
Saudi Arabia, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry on Monday described 
as "disgusting" a report that the Saudis had promised the president to lower 
oil prices before the November vote.
<P>Kerry was responding to an allegation by reporter Bob Woodward that Saudi 
Ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan had promised Bush that his country will 
increase oil output in the months before the election  --  which would have 
the effect of driving down U.S. gasoline prices and giving the Bush re-
election campaign a big boost.
<P>"If ... it is true that gas supplies and prices in America are tied to 
the American election, tied to a secret White House deal, that is outrageous 
and unacceptable to the American people," Kerry said during a campaign stop in 
Florida.
<P>Woodward's new book about the Iraq war, "Plan of Attack," quotes Bush as 
saying "I'm worried about the capacity of the oil market" after an invasion of 
Iraq and asking about Saudi Arabia's ability to increase production. Woodward 
writes that Bandar said his country "hoped to fine-tune oil prices over 10 
months to prime the economy for 2004."
<P>"What was key, Bandar knew, were the economic conditions before a 
presidential election," Woodward wrote, "not at the moment of the election."
<P>The Saudis denied the report, and White House spokesman Dan Bartlett told 
CNN, "There was no secret deal."
<P>At a press conference earlier in the day, however, another White House 
spokesman, Scott McClellan, did not directly answer 14 questions put to him by 
reporters about whether such a deal existed.
<P>McClellan said only that Bandar had visited the White House on April 1 
and pledged to take actions to ensure that crude oil prices remain between $22 
and $28 a barrel.
<P>"We've made our views very clear that prices should be determined by 
market forces, and we are always in close contact with producers around the 
world on these issues to make sure that actions aren't taken that harm our 
consumers or harm our economy," McClellan said.
<P>Bandar on Monday called Woodward's report "not true."
<P>He said gasoline prices are rising because of inadequate U.S. refining 
capacity rather than tight oil supplies. "It doesn't matter how much oil we 
produce today," he said. "You cannot refine enough."
<P>Bandar's family is close to the Bush family, and the prince is reportedly 
the only diplomat in Washington who has regular access to the Oval Office. 
However, he is known to be more pro-American than other members of the royal 
family, and some of his previous promises have been overruled at home.
<P>Woodward's accusations pack extra punch because of soaring gasoline 
prices across the nation. Prices are at an all-time high nationwide, the 
Energy Department announced Monday, with a national average of $1.81 per 
gallon for regular  --  a 30-cent increase so far this year. The average price 
in California, where air-quality rules impose higher refining costs, is $2.15 
per gallon, the department said.
<P>Some private experts are predicting that the U.S. average will rise to as 
much as $3 per gallon this summer, noting that stocks are at the lowest levels 
in 30 years for this time of the year. "The gasoline market is now on the 
precipice of a serious supply problem," Barclays Capital said in a recent 
report.
<P>The combination of the soaring prices and Woodward's allegations could 
provide a significant boost for Kerry's campaign.
<P>"Right now, there are people all over this country who are literally 
going through their purses and their pocketbooks  --  looking behind the sofa, 
under the cushions  --  to find the pennies and the extra money to be able to 
pay the additional costs of gasoline," the Massachusetts senator said Monday. 
<P>"They are giving up choices for their kids, giving up choices for their 
families to pay the extra $30-$50 a week in order to be able to pay for gas. 
Those aren't Exxon gas prices we see. ... those are Halliburton prices, and we 
deserve a break in this country."
<P>Halliburton is the Texas-based oil services corporation that was run by 
Vice President Dick Cheney from 1995 to 2000 and is now the leading contractor 
for the U.S. military in Iraq. The company has been accused of overcharging 
the military $61 million for gasoline delivered to Iraq under a no-bid 
contract.
<P>In recent months, Kerry has advocated a broad switch of U.S. energy 
policy, saying the Bush administration's emphasis on drilling more oil at home 
and abroad should be replaced with programs to conserve fuel and reduce 
American dependence on imported oil.
<P>Kerry said Monday that he has his own plan for lowering gas prices. "And 
you know what the No. 1 priority of that plan was? Put pressure on the Saudis 
to increase production and lower the prices to America," he said.
<P>Kerry suggested that the deal reported by Woodward shows that the 
administration is coddling the Saudis and other Arab oil producers that are 
suspected of serving as sources of funds for terrorist groups.
<P>Kerry pledged to end "this sweetheart relationship with a bunch of Arab 
countries that still allows money to move to Hamas, Hezbollah and the Al Aqsa 
Brigade."
