<P>WASHINGTON - A new documentary on the late Sen. Paul Wellstone offers this surprising fact about the proud Minnesotan: he didn't want to move to Minnesota.</p>
<p>After Carleton College offered the 25-year-old Wellstone a teaching job, the North Carolina resident was trying to find reasons not to accept, recalls friend Jim Stimson.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't want to live in Minnesota,&quot; says a laughing Stimson, after hesitating about whether to offer this information for public consumption.</p>
<p>But in the documentary, &quot;<a href="http://www.carryitforward.org/" target="_new">Wellstone!</a>,&quot; the future Democratic senator is shown throwing himself into Minnesota full-bore, from organizing on behalf of farmers and workers, to his 12 years in the United States Senate.</p>
<p>The 88-minute documentary will premiere Oct. 14 at the Heights Theater in Minneapolis as part of the Central Standard Film Festival. It was originally to be called &quot;<a href="http://www.carryitforward.org/" target="_new">Carry it Forward</a>,&quot; put producers decided to change the name to avoid confusion with the movie &quot;Pay it Forward.&quot;</p>
<p>The film was produced by Hard Working Pictures, a St. Paul, Minn., production company at a cost of around $350,000. It covers the lives of Wellstone and his wife Sheila from the time they met in high school.</p>
<p>The Wellstones and their daughter, Marcia Wellstone Markuson, were killed, along with five others, in a plane crash just days before the 2002 Senate election. Wellstone's replacement on the ballot, former Vice President Walter Mondale, lost the Senate race to Republican Norm Coleman.</p>
<p>One theme is the Wellstones' ability to connect with regular people despite reaching the pinnacle of political power.</p>
<p>&quot;They were just such ordinary people that they were like your best friend,&quot; says Jayne Marsnick, a supporter from the Iron Range.</p>
<p>&quot;He'd be walking down the hallway and cross the hallway and come to you and shake your hand and talk to you,&quot; says an unnamed Capitol Hill maintenance worker. Adds another: &quot;A lot of senators don't say nothing to you.&quot;</p>
<p>There is also footage of Sheila Wellstone's work on behalf of domestic abuse victims, including a &quot;Silent Witness&quot; exhibit she put together at the Capitol.</p>
<p>Paul Wellstone is portrayed as a serious, high-minded champion of progressive causes, but not without a sense of humor. In a serious tone, he tells a small group of elderly women that he will not accept any money from tobacco companies.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, they never have offered any,&quot; he says, laughing heartily. &quot;That's not a big sacrifice for me ...&quot;</p>
<p>Stimson says that Wellstone's political consciousness was raised as a graduate student at the University of North Carolina, after spending time with poor people living in Durham.</p>
<p>Wellstone &quot;reached into their lives and empathized with the way they lived,&quot; says Stimson, recalling how Wellstone organized for poor university cafeteria workers.</p>
<p>Jeff Blodgett, who went on to become Wellstone's campaign manager, described Wellstone as a &quot;pretty easy grader&quot; at Carleton, and one who some suspected graded on ideology. Another student-turned-staffer, Kari Moe, described how students rallied to save Wellstone's job after the administration tired of his political activism.</p>
<p>The film is unabashedly pro-Wellstone, but it doesn't gloss over his missteps. It notes, for example, how he offended veterans by staging an anti-war news conference in front of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial soon after arriving in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;Paul was brash when he got here,&quot; says Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, one of Wellstone's closest friends in the Senate.</p>
<p>A major focus of &quot;Wellstone!&quot; is his willingness to take unpopular positions. In 1996, for example, Wellstone was the only senator up for re-election to vote against an overhaul of the nation's welfare system. In a Senate speech, he predicts children will be hurt by the law.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't have the lobbyists, they don't have the PACs,&quot; Wellstone says.</p>
<p>Six years later, Wellstone faced another tough election-year challenge, voting down a resolution authorizing war with Iraq, which Coleman used against him in the campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;He thought the vote on Iraq could cost him the election,&quot; recalls Colin McGinnis, Wellstone's chief of staff at the time.
