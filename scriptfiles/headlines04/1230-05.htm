<p> BANDA ACEH, Indonesia  - The death toll in the  Indian Ocean tsunami disaster soared above 120,000 on Thursday  as millions scrambled for food and fresh water and thousands  more fled in panic to high ground on rumors of new waves.

   The mercilessness of Asia's tsunami grew clearer on Thursday as worst-hit Indonesia sharply raised its death toll, taking the number of fatalities around the whole Indian Ocean region above 120,000. Health Ministry sources told Reuters just under 80,000 had died in Indonesia's northern Aceh province that was close to the undersea quake, some 28,000 more than previously announced. Two sources said the toll would be officially announced soon.

Aid agencies warned many more, from Indonesia to Sri Lanka,  could die in epidemics if shattered communications and  transport hampered what may prove history's biggest relief  operation.
<p> 
			
			Rescue workers pressed on into isolated villages shattered  by a disaster that could yet eclipse a cyclone that struck  Bangladesh in 1991, killing 138,000 people.<p> 
			
			Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called for an  emergency meeting of the Group of Eight so that the rich  nations club could discuss aid and possible debt reduction  following "the worst cataclysm of the modern era."<p> 
			
			The total toll had shot up more than 50 percent in a day  with still no clear picture of conditions in some isolated  islands and villages around India and Indonesia.<p> 
			
			While villagers and fishermen suffered devastation, losses  among foreign tourists, essential to local economies, mounted.<p> 
			
			Prime Minister Goran Persson said more than 1,000 Swedes  may have been killed in the disaster.<p> 
			
			Indonesian Health Ministry sources told Reuters just under  80,000 had died in the northern Aceh province that was close to  the undersea quake, some 28,000 more than previously announced.  Two sources said the toll would be officially announced soon.<p> 
			
			THE FASTEST GET THE FOOD<p> 
			
			The airport of the main city, Banda Aceh, was busy with aid  flights, but residents said little was getting through to them.  Hungry crowds jostling for aid biscuits besieged people  delivering them in the town. Some drivers dared not stop.<p> 
			
			"Some cars come by and throw food like that. The fastest  get the food, the strong one wins. The elderly and the injured  don't get anything. We feel like dogs," said Usman, 43.<p> 
			
			Residents of the city fled their homes when two aftershocks  revived fresh memories of the worst earthquake in 40 years.<p> 
			
			"I was sleeping, but fled outside in panic. If I am going  to die, I will die here. Just let it be," said Kaspian, 26.<p> 
			
			Rumors, unfounded, of another tsunami swept to the seaboard  of Sri Lanka and India, highlighting the continued tension  across the stricken region four days after the quake.<p> 
			
			The Indian government issued a precautionary alert for all  areas hit by the weekend's killer wave.<p> 
			
			Police sirens blared on beaches in Tamil Nadu, one of the  worst hit states in a country that has lost 13,000, as  thousands streamed inland on foot or crammed any vehicle they  could find. "Waves are coming! Waves are coming," some shouted.<p> 
			
			This time, however, the waves did not come.<p> 
			
			There were similar scenes in Sri Lanka, where over 27,000  have been killed. Thousands fled inland from the eastern coast.<p> 
			
			"This isn't just a situation of giving out food and water.  Entire towns and villages need to be rebuilt from the ground  up," said Rod Volway of CARE Canada, whose emergency team was  one of the first into Aceh.<p> 
			
			The world pledged $220 million in cash and sent a flotilla  of ships and aircraft laden with supplies.<p> 
			
			"As many as 5 million people are not able to access what  they need for living," said David Nabarro, head of a World  Health Organization (WHO) crisis team.<p> 
			
			Many villages and resorts are now mud-covered rubble,  blanketed with the stench of corpses after the 9.0 magnitude  quake.<p> 
			
			Thousands of bodies rotting in the tropical heat were  tumbled into mass graves, but health officials said polluted  water posed a much greater threat than corpses.<p> 
			
			Holiday-makers were among those caught by surprise. Nearly  5,000 foreigners -- half from Sweden and Germany -- are  missing, many in Thailand, where 710 foreigners have been  confirmed dead.<p> 
			
			AID CHAOS<p> 
			
			Authorities warned of many deaths from dysentery, cholera  and typhoid fever caused by contaminated food and water, and  malaria and dengue fever carried by mosquitoes.<p> 
			
			Indonesian aircraft dropped food to isolated areas in Aceh  on northern Sumatra, an island the size of Florida -- areas  that may not be reached by land for days.<p> 
			
			In Sri Lanka's worst-hit area Ampara, residents ran things  themselves, going around with loudhailers, asking people to  donate pots and pans, buckets of fresh water and sarongs.<p> 
			
			"Frustration will be growing in the days and the weeks  ahead," said U.N. emergency relief coordinator Jan Egeland.<p> 
			
			The United Nations prepared what could be its largest  appeal for donations to cope with its biggest relief effort.<p> 
			
			The United States said a pledge of $35 million was just a  start, and sent an aircraft carrier group toward Sumatra and  other ships including a helicopter carrier to the Bay of  Bengal.<p> 
			
			Financial costs, estimated at up to $14 billion, are tiny  relative to the human suffering. By comparison, Hurricane  Andrew killed 50 people in 1992 but, with much of the damage in  the United States, cost around $30 billion.<p> 
			
			In the Thai resort turned graveyard of Khao Lak, the grim  task of retrieving bodies was interrupted briefly when a tremor  cleared the beach of people in a flash.<p> 
			
			Dutch, German and Swiss forensic teams flew to Thailand to  help identify now hard to recognize bodies by collecting dental  evidence, DNA samples, fingerprints, photographs and X-rays.<p> 
			
			Preserving bodies was an urgent need and Prime Minister  Thaksin Shinawatra promised to provide refrigerated containers.<p> 
			
			In north Sri Lanka, survivors recovering corpses faced a  new danger -- floating land mines from a long-running conflict.<p> 
			
			Animals seem to have escaped the disaster, adding weight to  notions they possess a "sixth sense" for disasters, experts  said.
