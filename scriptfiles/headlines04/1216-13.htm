<p>WASHINGTON --


No buttons, signs or unusual dress will distinguish the protesters from the thousands who will line the inaugural parade route next month, but at a set time, they say they will demonstrate against President Bush -- by turning their backs on the chief executive. <br><br>Coupled with the widely expected pomp and pageantry of a presidential inauguration are demonstrations by protesters angered by Bush's policies, in particular the war in Iraq. <br><br>Getting ready for Jan. 20, 2005, various groups are using Web sites, e-mails, fliers and word of mouth to urge thousands of demonstrators to gather in the nation's capital. <br><br>Among planned events are an anti-war rally and three-mile march to the White House, a massive bike ride similar to those that disrupted traffic in New York City before the Republican National Convention, and a "die-in" to remind the nation of more than 1,200 U.S. dead in Iraq. <br><br>Through the Web site www.turnyourbackonbush.org, organizers are urging demonstrators to leave political buttons and placards at home, join other parade-goers on the afternoon of the inauguration and then, as Bush's motorcade passes, show the president their backs. <br><br>"Turning your back is as old as authority itself," said Jet Heiko, a Philadelphia-based protest organizer. "It's a very understandable symbol for defying authority." <br><br>On its Web site, the group called it a unique action because "we won't know who is participating until the moment it begins." <br><br>The DC Anti-War Network is organizing a rally and march to the White House on the morning of the inauguration, getting the word out through the Web site www.counter-inaugural.org/, which says, "Bush isn't going away, and neither are we." <br><br>The violence in Iraq was one reason more than 100,000 protesters filled New York City streets on a Sunday morning in August before the Republican convention. Organizers of the inauguration protests expect stronger feelings toward the war to persuade thousands to travel to Washington next month. <br><br>Heightened security, January weather and the calendar -- the inauguration falls on a Thursday -- are certain to limit the numbers. <br><br>In 2000, additional officers from the Metropolitan Police and other law enforcement agencies kept order, and no major confrontations occurred and only a handful of people were arrested. Security is expected to be even tighter for the first inauguration since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. <br><br>Four years ago, protest organizers capitalized on strong feelings over the disputed election, which had barely subsided, and the timing inauguration fell on a Saturday. This year's election was settled weeks ago, on Nov. 3, when Democratic Sen. John Kerry called to congratulate Bush. <br><br>Still, organizers hope to attract a crowd. <br><br>"We got 80 percent of people to protest the Republican Convention in New York in the last week," said Jim Macdonald of the DC Anti-War Network. <br><br>* __ <br><br>On the Net: <br><br>Official inaugural Web site: <a href="http://www.inaugural05.com">http://www.inaugural05.com</a> <br><br>Protest organizers: <a href="http://www.turnyourbackonbush.org">http://www.turnyourbackonbush.org</a> <br><br>Protest organizers: <a href="http://www.counter-inaugural.org">http://www.counter-inaugural.org</a>
