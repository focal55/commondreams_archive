BAGHDAD, Iraq — The memories were  so raw that the boy's words tumbled out of his mouth on Tuesday, a day after he  survived   an American attack that destroyed his house outside Falluja.</p>
<P>
"The house shuddered," said Haider Abdel-Wahab, a 6-year-old taken to a Baghdad hospital after being dug out of the rubble. "The room turned red."</p>
<P>
His father died of a bullet wound to the head and his mother was shot and killed while hanging laundry, he said. After that, he said, a "missile fell on us." His brothers were crushed, but he said he was dug out by neighbors using shovels. </p>
<P>
Iraqis who have fled Falluja tell of random gunfire, dead and wounded lying in the streets, and ambulances being shot up. Their accounts of the American offensive on Falluja, mounted after the ambush and mutilation of four American security contractors there, are the ones many Arabs in the region are hearing. </p>
<P>
The battle in this Sunni stronghold west of Baghdad has gripped the attention of much of Iraq, serving as a rallying point for both Sunnis and Shiites, who have joined to provide aid and donate blood. It has also put the American-installed Iraqi Governing Council at odds with the occupation authorities, with some council members threatening to resign and criticizing the use of military force. </p>
<P>
Two Arabic television stations, Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera, based correspondents in Falluja during the offensive, beaming footage of American airstrikes and rows of Iraqi bodies laid out under blankets. Iraqi doctors have gone on camera saying hundreds of Iraqis had been killed. </p>
<P>
Such reports, highlighting the Iraqi civilian toll,  have put American military officials on the offensive.   At a news conference on Monday, Gen. John P. Abizaid, the American commander in the Middle East, said of his  troops: "They have been very precise. They have attempted to protect civilians to the best of their ability. </p>
<P>
"The Arab press, in particular Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya, are portraying their actions as purposely targeting civilians, and we absolutely do not do that, and I think everybody knows that." </p>
<P>
The chaos of battle complicates the task of those seeking the truth. </p>
<P>
"At the present time, because of the security situation, our movements are rather limited," said a Human Rights Watch researcher, Hania Mufti. "One needs to verify the information directly. There are eyewitnesses that need to be interviewed, and people who we need to talk for forensic evidence that may be available. </p>
<P>
"One needs to see whether they were unarmed civilians going about their business, what kind of force the United States was using, and the circumstances surrounding the killing of civilians in Falluja," she said.</p>
<P>
Jo Wilding, a volunteer who accompanied other foreigners and Iraqis carrying  medical supplies to a clinic in Falluja on Saturday, gave her account of civilians caught up the offensive. </p>
<P>
"Two children had head wounds from bullets, both died," she said in Baghdad after her return. "In another room was an old woman with a bullet wound — she was still holding a white flag." </p>
<P>
She described helping Iraqis collect bodies. One was  a dead gunman. Another was an elderly man, lying dead face down at his gate. In the house, she said, "girls were screaming, saying `Baba, baba.' "</p>
<P>
She said that while in an ambulance with sirens on and lights flashing, they were fired on from the direction of American marines who had taken over a rooftop. "We started reversing," she said. "There was still firing. There were people with guns all over the place."  </p>
<P>
Since a cease-fire was declared over the weekend, more and more Iraqis have fled Falluja for Baghdad, seeking safety and medical care. Although the circumstances behind their injuries may be difficult to determine, their cost is not. </p>
<P>
Four-year-old Ali Nasser Fadil lies in a Baghdad hospital, his eyes  wide and fixed on a spot on the ceiling. Before reaching the  hospital, his left leg was crudely amputated by Iraqi doctors. A deep gash across his groin and upper thigh was barely stitched up when he was brought in. </p>
<P>
"He was in danger of dying," said Dr. Alessandro Bartolini, who  had to amputate Ali's left hand.  "It is blast injuries," he said. </p>
<P>
Ali's father said he moved his children to their grandfather's house on the outskirts of Falluja for safety, but the area was hit in an American air strike. "When I reached my child," he said, "it was as if he was sleeping." </p>
<P>
Elsewhere, 10-year-old Waed Joda spoke for his father, who wounded by shrapnel. The bandage swathing the man's shoulder and arm was soaked through with blood. </p>
<P>
"American snipers shot at us as we were trying to flee Falluja," he said. "We were in the car, we jumped out and tried to take cover in some shops. Falluja has become destroyed." </p>
