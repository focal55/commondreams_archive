<p>A group of prominent Bay Area women, including pioneering chef Alice 
Waters of Chez Panisse, is jousting with media giant Clear Channel 
Communications over a minimalist anti-war billboard they want to unfurl in New 
York City's Times Square amid flashy ads for Broadway shows, banks and 
sneakers.
<P>Project Billboard, the women's nascent nonprofit, rented prime real 
estate on the Marriott Marquis Hotel on Broadway and then proposed an 
illustration of a cartoonish bomb draped with stars and stripes, accompanied 
by the words "Democracy is best taught by example, not by war." 
<P>It was supposed to run from Aug. 2 to Nov. 2, well-timed to a Republican 
National Convention starting Aug. 30 in Manhattan and the presidential 
election Nov. 2 dominated by the conflict in Iraq.

The women say their group is nonpartisan and the design is "pro-democracy,
pro-peace, and nothing more.'' But it was rejected last week by Clear 
Channel's Spectacolor division, which rents out more than 70 displays in Times 
Square, as well as by Marriott.
<P>"We're just not going to run bomb copy in New York City,'' said Paul 
Meyer, president and chief executive of Clear Channel Outdoor  --  which 
oversees the Spectacolor division  --  Sunday afternoon.
<P>While accusing Clear Channel of rejecting the ad because the company 
favors the Bush administration, the women on Friday changed course, turning 
the bomb into a dove. They were told they would have a response sometime this 
week.
<P>But with a Thursday deadline looming for them to finalize a design  --  
and with Clear Channel suggesting it also didn't like the phrase "not by war'' 
--  the women decided to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit in U.S. District 
Court in New York today.  They allege they were never told they couldn't cover 
political ground. 
<P>The fast-moving controversy, though, took another turn Sunday night when 
Meyer said he found out from Spectacolor officials that Clear Channel had 
approved the second design, and was awaiting word from Marriott, which he said 
has the right to reject any ad on its facade.
<P>"In the contract, they represented they owned these billboards. There was 
never another layer of approval," said Baifang Schell of Project Billboard, 
who is married to Orville Schell, dean of the school of journalism at UC 
Berkeley.
<P>Schell and two other Project Billboard founders, Deborah Rappaport and 
Amy Harmon, flew to New York on Sunday morning to go to court and keep 
negotiating. Another member of the group, Laurene Powell Jobs, is married to 
Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs.
<P>New York Marriott Marquis spokeswoman Kathleen Duffy said Sunday that the 
hotel management considered the first proposal by Project Billboard to be 
inappropriate because of the bomb image and said the hotel was led to believe 
the ad would simply encourage people to vote.
<P>She said management had not seen the dove design yet.
<P>"I'm constantly shocked by how there is such an effort to really prevent 
people from contemplating the difficult issues of our time,'' Waters said. 
"The message of the sign was trying to get people to think about this. And 
clearly, it's not what the powers-that-be want people to do.''
<P>But Meyer said Sunday that the company reserves the right to reject 
advertising for any reason. He said advertising is rejected routinely for 
being indecent or offensive, or because the business owner simply doesn't want 
the sign on his property. But, he said, the problem is never partisan politics.
<P>"Never has anyone said to me from Clear Channel corporate that I should 
or should not put up copy because of its political ramifications,'' Meyer said.
"That's contrary to the principles of the company  --  we're in the business 
of maximizing profits for our shareholders.
<P>"I'd love to get the Democrats' spending, the Republican spending and the 
Nader spending,'' he said.
<P>The billboard flap pits a group of influential, well-heeled and 
progressive Bay Area women, many of them Democratic Party contributors, 
against a Fortune 500 company that is responsible for quite a bit of what 
Americans see and hear.
<P>Clear Channel, of San Antonio, owns or operates 1,270 radio stations and 
39 television stations in the United States and has 776,000 outdoor 
advertising displays worldwide. Some critics have accused Clear Channel, whose 
top executives and political action committee have given heavily to 
Republicans, of using radio airwaves and other far-reaching assets to push its 
views.
<P>According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in Washington,
D.C., as of the end of May, the company's PAC this year had given $170,000 to 
U.S. House and Senate candidates, with 70 percent going to Republicans. 
<P>Peter Scheer, executive director of the California First Amendment 
Coalition in San Rafael, an advocacy group for freedom of expression and open 
government, said that Clear Channel's rejection of the ad was "obnoxious to 
the First Amendment,'' but that the company was probably on firm legal ground 
because it's private.
<P>"But Clear Channel is a huge corporation. ... I think one could argue 
that it's gotten so big that it could have forced on it responsibilities much 
like those that a government agency would have,'' Scheer said. "Obviously, 
it's engaged in censorship here, and it is the worst kind of censorship 
because it is based directly on the content of the message.''
<P>"That's a specious theory,'' Meyer responded. "To my knowledge, there's 
no law that supports that.''
<P>Project Billboard was launched last year, with its founders saying they 
want to foster open national debate on important issues and support diversity, 
tolerance and free expression. It signed a contract with Clear Channel 
Spectacolor last December for $368,000, not including production and 
installation costs.
<P>In an e-mail to Barry Kula, Spectacolor's vice president of sales and 
marketing, Rappaport said: "Our billboard does not support or oppose a 
particular candidate, government officer, or political party. ... Nor do we 
believe that a reference to war is somehow 'distasteful' to the community.''
<P>Meyer said the decision to reject the ad was made independently by the 
Spectacolor division. But he said the company generally does not run copy that 
would be unsuitable for children or cause them to ask difficult questions, nor 
does it run political attacks that could be considered "personally offensive.''
<P>"We err on the side of rejecting the copy,'' he said.
