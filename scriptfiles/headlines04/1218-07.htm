<p>Developing countries are urging changes to a deal drawn up by the US and the EU at the UN climate change conference.
<p>The draft agreement emerged late on Friday, after two weeks of negotiations in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires.
<p>It provides for informal talks to be held in May on ways of tackling global warming in the longer term.
<p>But at the final session on Saturday, emerging countries demanded a written guarantee that they would not be subjected to greenhouse gas curbs.

<p>The BBC's Liz Blunt at the conference says Saturday began with smiles of relief, as delegates emerged with what appeared to be a consensus text.
<p>The EU and the US - which had clashed over a proposal for future informal seminars - had managed to bury their differences.
<p>But it is now clear that they did not manage to carry developing countries along with them, our correspondent adds. 

<p><b>Give and take</b>
<p>India - supported by China, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia - called for an amendment to the deal.
<p>The EU opposed this, saying the outcome of future talks should not be prejudiced.
<p>The draft agreement came after days of wrangling between Brussels and Washington that extended the Buenos Aires meeting well past its scheduled close.
<p>The EU had insisted on a series of informal meetings on emission cuts when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012.
<p>In the end the US won its demand for one meeting, next May, but agreed it would be held over several days.
<p>The meeting will "promote an informal exchange of information" on cutting harmful emissions and adapting to climate change, according to the draft text.
<p>The US - which pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 - had until then resisted any talk about longer-term action beyond 2012.
<p>"It is a give-and-take exercise and I think on balance we are very pleased with the outcome," said US lead negotiator Harlan Watson.
<p><b>Survival</b>
<p>EU negotiator Yvo de Boer said the deal contained pretty much something for everyone.
<p>Kyoto commits signatories to trim output of six greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, by at least 5.2% by 2012, compared with 1990 levels.
<p>The Europeans have been seeking to involve the US and major emerging economies, such as China and India, in a post-Kyoto agreement on further emission reductions.
<p>The objections to the draft deal are not shared by all developing countries.
<p>South Africa and a number of smaller island states supported the EU's position on Saturday.
<p>Island states threatened by rising sea levels are particularly keen to tackle global warming.
<p>Martin Puta Tofinga, environment minister for the Pacific archipelago of Kiribati, said: "I am talking about survival here, we need to move forward in a meaningful way."
