<p>Senator John F. Kerry may have won the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, but he still faces a fight for the hearts and minds of the party's antiwar wing.</p>

With violence surging in Iraq, voters who want a quick end to  the US-led occupation are shaping up as a potentially critical constituency, and Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader is making a direct pitch for their  support in November.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, a vocal war critic, continues to campaign in the hope of exerting influence at the Democratic convention in  July.</p>
<p>Leaders of progressive groups who are backing Kerry despite reservations about his Iraq stands say they doubt Nader will peel away significant support from Kerry in the fall election. They  say their members know that the stakes are too high, that the race against President Bush will be close, and that votes for Nader even could be  political suicide.</p>
<p>Still, polls  indicated Nader  is in  mid-range single digits nationally. In 2000, when he received less than 3 percent of the total vote, the margin between Bush and Democrat Al Gore was less than half of  1 percent in five  states -- Florida, New Mexico, Iowa, Oregon, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>&quot;A few percent in certain states, and he could turn the whole thing,&quot; said Don Kusler, spokesman for Americans for Democratic Action,  a liberal advocacy group with 65,000 members. &quot;He has the potential to have an enormous impact. It really depends on where the damage is done.&quot;</p>
<p>Nader is unfazed by  Democratic critics who say that he was a spoiler four years ago when he ran under the Green Party banner and that he could be one in the election this year.</p>
<p>On Iraq, Nader told the Globe that Kerry's position is &quot;the exact position needed not to get any votes on the issue.&quot; He added: &quot;It's fuzzed. It's good he's saying we should go to the United Nations for authority . . . but by asking for more troops, he's basically validating Bush's occupation.&quot;</p>
<p>Kerry, who voted in 2002 for the resolution authorizing Bush to use force, has called on the administration to find more allies to provide military help in Iraq and &quot;make the United Nations a full partner responsible for developing Iraq's transition to a new constitution and government.&quot; But Kerry has said he would support sending more troops to Iraq if military commanders say they are needed.</p>
<p>Nader, who has yet to qualify for the ballot in any state, wants a deadline set for US troop withdrawal and replacements from a UN peacekeeping force, followed by internationally supervised elections in Iraq. He also has said Congress should begin an impeachment inquiry of Bush and Vice President  Dick Cheney.</p>
<p>Kerry's campaign declined to respond to Nader's specific criticism, but campaign spokeswoman Kathy Roeder said, &quot;If people want to beat George Bush in November, they should vote for John Kerry.&quot;</p>
<p>That sentiment is expressed by leaders of several  liberal advocacy  groups, who  support Kerry despite the unease of many about his support for the Iraq resolution, his shifting stands during the course of the campaign, and his current positions on Iraq, which some critics privately say  differ only by degree from the administration's.</p>
<p>Most said they think their members will support Kerry rather than make a statement on the war by voting for Nader.</p>
<p>&quot;What we see in our membership is a unanimity behind Kerry,&quot; said Eli Pariser, executive director of the political action committee of MoveOn, which vigorously opposed the invasion of Iraq. &quot;When we sent out a message to raise money for Kerry, we got more  flak from a handful of people who are supporters of Kucinich. I haven't received a single piece of mail from a Nader supporter yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Ellen R. Malcolm, president of two major activist groups, said anti-Bush sentiment is so high  among liberals  that she thinks it will limit Nader's appeal to war opponents. &quot;There are some people who agree with the Nader approach,&quot; said Malcolm, head of Emily's List,  which champions Democratic female candidates and women's issues, and America Coming Together, which is organizing voters in 17 battleground states. &quot;But most of the people I talk to are so upset with Bush on Iraq and other issues that they'll vote for Kerry.&quot;</p>
<p>Although Kerry has locked up more than enough convention delegates to win the Democratic nomination, Kucinich continues to campaign as an opponent of the war and other Bush policies.  Kucinich, who has secured about 30 convention delegates out of 4,322, is campaigning extensively in Oregon, which holds its presidential primary May 18. In the next few days, Kucinich is scheduled to campaign in Pennsylvania, which has its primary next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Attempts to reach Kucinich were unsuccessful.  But according to The Columbian, a newspaper in Vancouver, Wash., Kucinich said at a recent campaign appearance, &quot;I've stayed in this race to give people in states across the country the option to keep the contest of ideas alive.&quot;  Kucinich, who advocates replacing US troops with UN peacekeepers, said: &quot;We need to insist our party stand for something. That it not just be willing to provide a Democratic version of the war as opposed to the Republican version of the war.&quot;</p>
<p>For most of the campaign for the Democratic nomination, former Vermont governor Howard Dean was a favorite of antiwar activists. Dean, who dropped out of the race two months ago, has endorsed Kerry. On Iraq, &quot;John Kerry's position and mine are the same at this point,&quot; Dean told the Globe. &quot;He wants to get the UN involved, which is critical.&quot; Dean, who has established Democracy for America, a grass-roots organization to support progressive  candidates, said a vote for Nader will be tantamount to a vote for Bush.</p>
<p>Mark Green, an original Nader Raider consumer and public interest activist, said &quot;the minor differences between the Democratic nominee and me on Iraq are microscopic compared to the chasm between me and Bush.&quot; He contends &quot;99 percent of Democratic progressives&quot; hold the same view and will not back Nader. Green, president of the New Democracy Project, a public policy institute, and coauthor of a recent book critical of Bush, is cochairman of Kerry's campaign in New York.</p>
<p>Robert L. Borosage, codirector of  Campaign for America's Future, said that among antiwar activists there is &quot;a lot of murmuring&quot; about Kerry's posture on Iraq. But Borosage, who disagrees with Kerry on the issue of sending more troops to Iraq, predicted the activists ultimately will support the Democrat. &quot;People see very clearly this time what the stakes are in this election,&quot; he said. &quot;Bush unifies progressives with Kerry the way [former president] Clinton unified conservatives.&quot;</p>
