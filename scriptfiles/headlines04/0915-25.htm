<P>KABUL  - Three Americans have been sentenced to up  to 10 years in jail after being found guilty by an Afghan court  on charges including torture, running a private prison and  illegal detention.
<P>
Jonathan "Jack" Idema, a former U.S. Green Beret, was  arrested in July along with another ex-serviceman, Brent  Bennett, and documentary film-maker Edward Caraballo.
<P>
They had denied the charges and insisted they were in  Afghanistan with U.S. and Afghan government sanction to help  track down al Qaeda and Taliban extremists.
<P>
"I apologize that we tried to save these people," Idema  told reporters immediately after the verdict.
<P>
"We should have let the Taliban murder every ... one of  them," he said bitterly.
<P>
Idema and Bennett were each sentenced to 10 years in jail  and Caraballo to eight. Four Afghan co-defendants received  sentences ranging from one to five years.
<P>
John Edwards Tiffany, a lawyer for Idema, said they planned  to appeal.
<P>
"Justice was not served today," Tiffany said. "I blame the  U.S. government, the Bush administration and the Afghan legal  system, which is not anywhere near where it needs to be."
<P>
Idema told the court earlier that he had been issued with a  passport by a special U.S. agency that he declined to name and  had a visa for Afghanistan similar to those given to special  forces operatives.
<P>
Speaking under an oath he swore on the Koran -- to applause  from the gallery -- Idema insisted he had been operating with  official U.S. and Afghan sanction.
<P>
"I swear in the name of Allah to tell the truth and nothing  but the truth," he said. He did not give details on why he thought the FBI had set  him up, or what their motive might be.
<P>
Other media have reported that Idema saw himself as a  bounty hunter, and was after the fortune U.S. authorities have  placed on Osama bin Laden's head.
<P>
SET UP
<P>
Shortly before the verdict was read, Idema told reporters  that he had been set up, saying the U.S. government had  abandoned them as soon as accusations of torture were made.
<P>
"No one tortured anyone," he added.
<P>
The Idema case came to light in the wake of scandals over  U.S. treatment of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan.
<P>
Afghan authorities said Idema had entered the country  illegally, was running a private prison, had tortured and  illegally detained Afghans and had harmed relations between  Afghanistan and the U.S.
<P>
Earlier, the judge rejected an appeal by the defendants'  lawyers to dismiss the case on the grounds the court was not up  to international standards.
<P>
They said the judicial process they had experienced so far  scarcely met Afghan standards, let alone international ones.
<P>
"This is so far removed from what I am used to," Tiffany  told reporters during a recess.
<P>
Idema has insisted since his arrest that he was operating  for the U.S. government on anti-terror activities, claiming to  have been in contact with officials working for Defense  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. 
<P>He said he was gathering intelligence in the hunt for bin  Laden and other al Qaeda officials, blamed for the Sept. 11,  2001 attacks on the United States and believed to be hiding  somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border.
<P>
The Pentagon has denied that.
<P>
Wednesday, Idema arrived at the court wearing a khaki  military-style shirt with a U.S. flag on the right shoulder,  dark sunglasses and a black-and-white Arabic style scarf  favored by U.S. special forces in the region.
<P>
His lawyers showed the court a video of the three arriving  in Kabul and being spoken to at the airport by senior Afghan  officials including Kabul police chief Baba Jan -- proof, they  said, that their mission was a legal one.
