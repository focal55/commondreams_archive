<p>WASHINGTON - Launching a new effort to stem the plummeting
loss in public confidence in his Iraq policy, U.S. President George W Bush
reiterated his commitment to bringing ''freedom'' and self-government to
Baghdad and warned that U.S. failure will ''only mark the beginning of
peril and violence''.
</b> 
<p>
                  
   Addressing a respectful and unusually restrained group of mid- and
senior-level officers at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
Bush stressed that the stakes in Iraq, which he called ''the central front
in the war on terror'', were extremely high while suggesting that U.S.
occupation forces may be more likely to seek political solutions than to
resort to military force against suspected rebels or other malcontents.

Citing the U.S. Marines' recent agreement with to permit an all-Iraqi
force, including senior officers of dissolved Revolutionary Guard, to take
responsibility for security in Fallujah, Bush made clear that he fully
endorsed such an arrangement despite complaints, particularly from
neo-conservative and right-wing hawks, that the Fallujah deal amounted to
''appeasement''.
<p>
   ''American soldiers and Marines could have used overwhelming force,'' he
said. ''Our commanders, however, ‡determined that massive strikes against
the enemy would alienate the local population and increase support for the
insurgency.''
<p>
   ''So we have pursued a different approach. We're making security a
shared responsibility in Fallujah,'' he said, adding later, ''We want the
Iraqi people to know that we trust their growing capabilities, even as we
help build them''.
<p>
   Similarly, he reiterated U.S. support for U.N. Special Envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi's efforts to put together members of an interim government, the
naming of which Bush said Brahimi hoped to announced later this week. 
<p>
   The U.N. envoy has also come under strong attack, particularly by
neo-conservatives who charge that he has a pro-Sunni agenda aimed at
restoring power to Arab nationalists.
<p>
   ''America fully supports Mr Brahimi's efforts, and I have instructed the
Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to assist him in every way
possible'', Bush declared, effectively confirming that power within his
administration has shifted to the ''realists'' who have long supported a
much bigger role in Iraq for the United Nations.
<p>
   Bush, who spoke for roughly 30 minutes, announced no concrete new
initiatives in Iraq, other than the construction of a ''modern
maximum-security prison'' whose completion will house detainees who are
currently held at Abu Ghraib prison, the site of the now-notorious photos
of physical and sexual abuses committed by U.S. soldiers against Iraqi
detainees.
   ''Under the dictator (Saddam Hussein), prisons like Abu Ghraib were
symbols of death and torture,'' he said. ''That same prison became a symbol
of disgraceful conduct by a few American troops who dishonoured our country
and disregarded our values.''
<p>
   After the new prison's construction, he added: ''‡We will demolish the
Abu Ghraib prison as a fitting symbol of Iraq's new beginning.''
<p>
   Bush, whose public approval ratings fell to a record low of 41 percent
in the past week, was clearly trying to move the media and public spotlight
on recent setbacks, such as Abu Ghraib and recent reports that the
Pentagon's long-standing pick to rule Iraq, Ahmed Chalabi, may have been
working for Iran, in a more future-oriented and hopeful direction.
<p>
   To that end, he made a rare admission that some things had not gone
according to plan, notably that ''our commanders had estimated that a troop
level below 115,000 would be sufficient at this point in the conflict''. 
<p>
   ''Given the recent increase in violence'', he said, ''we will maintain
our troop level at the current 138,000 as long as necessary''. He added
that more troops would be sent to Iraq ''if the commanders said they were
needed''.
<p>
   Except for explicitly endorsing the strategy pursued by the Marines in
Fallujah, however, Bush did not suggest any major change in course, as some
observers have argued is necessary to regain the confidence of both the
U.S. public, and, more important, Iraqis, 90 percent of whom, according to
the most recent survey obtained by the 'Chicago Tribune' newspaper over the
weekend, now consider U.S. troops to be ''occupiers'' rather than
''liberators''.
<p>
   With Iraqi public opinion so hostile, some analysts had hoped that Bush
would make a dramatic announcement Monday, such as his intention to
withdraw all U.S. forces no later than the end of next year, or to renounce
any intention of retaining U.S. military facilities or rights to access to
bases on Iraqi territory after the occupation is ended.
<p>
   But Bush kept largely to the script that has been developed over the
last six weeks and laid out a five-step plan to ''help Iraq achieve
democracy and freedom'', including ''handing over authority to a sovereign
Iraqi government; help establish security, continue rebuilding Iraq's
infrastructure; encourage more international support; and move toward a
national election that will bring forward new leaders empowered by the
Iraqi people''.
<p>
   ''I sent American troops to Iraq to defend our security, not to stay as
an occupying power. I sent American troops to Iraq to make its people free,
not to make them Americans,'' he declared in one of his bigger applause lines.
<p>
   He said the interim government will ''exercise full sovereignty'' until
national elections are held by the end of next year, but did not define
sovereignty. He stressed that ''American military forces in Iraq will
operate under American command as a part of a multinational force
authorised by the United Nations''. 
<p>
   He also noted that the new U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which is supposed to
become the world's largest U.S. embassy with a staff of more than 2,000,
will have ''regional offices in key cities (that) ‡will work closely with
Iraqis at all levels of government‡''
<p>
   At the same time, Bush's tone was significantly less smug and
contemptuous than in other recent speeches, particularly with respect to
the United Nations and his praise for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, which Washington still hopes will decide to assume a
substantial security role in Iraq at next month's Istanbul Summit.
<p>
   Similarly, Bush dispensed with the word ''evil'' or ''evil-doers'' in
the address, although he still posed the conflict in black-and-white terms,
accusing ''terrorists'' of trying to ''impose Taliban-like rule country by
country across the greater Middle East''.
<p>
   ''They seek the total control of every person in mind and soul'', he
said. ''It is a totalitarian political ideology pursued with consuming zeal
and without conscience.''
<p>
   Instead of using another phrase that he and his top aides have
frequently deployed to describe their determination, ''Stay the course'',
he called on the public to ''keep our focus'' and ''do our duty''.
<p>
   It was an interesting change, prompted no doubt by the fact that ret.
Central Command chief, Gen Anthony Zinni, had mocked the phrase in a story
featured on the most widely viewed public-affairs television show, CBS' '60
Minutes' Sunday night.  ''(T)o think we are going to stay the course; the
course is headed over Niagara Falls,'' he said in a sentence that was also
widely quoted in the newspapers Monday morning.
<p>
   In some ways, the choice of the Army War College to deliver the speech
was also curious due to the fact that retired army commanders like Zinni,
Gen Wesley Clark and the most recent army chief of staff, Gen Eric
Shinseki, have been furious with the way the administration has treated
their overstretched service since the Iraq War.
<p>
   Indeed, officers attending Monday's speech appeared respectful, but
uncharacteristically subdued toward a sitting Republican president,
applauding less than 10 times in the course of a speech that contained
dozens of applause lines. 
<p>
   Bush himself occasionally paused during his delivery in apparent
anticipation of applause, but, hearing none, forged ahead with his text --
a fitting metaphor, perhaps, for the situation he faces in Iraq.
