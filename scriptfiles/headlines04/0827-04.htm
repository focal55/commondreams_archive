<p>The grandson of the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi has urged Palestinians to rise up peacefully to demand an end to Israeli occupation, and said freedom was close.

<p>Arun Gandhi said yesterday that non-violence would increase world sympathy for the Palestinians. It was not too late to start a non-violent movement in the West Bank and Gaza, captured by Israel in 1967, he said, and he condemned a barrier Israel is building in the West Bank as an "evil thing".

<p>"I know your day of freedom is very near," he told thousands of flag-waving Palestinians in the West Bank city of Ramallah after meeting Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian president.

Mr Gandhi visited the West Bank from his American home but despite a genial half-hour meeting with Mr Arafat in Ramallah, his pleas largely fell on deaf ears.

<p>"We can only achieve peace through non-violence," Mr Gandhi told The Independent. "When we respond to the oppressor the way the oppressor has done - with the use of violence - then we lose our moral strength."

<p>He described his conversation with the Palestinian leader as very fruitful. "We couldn't take any decisions in half an hour, but he agreed in principle that non-violence was an option. I intend to keep in touch with him."

<p>Some Palestinian commentators have started questioning the wisdom of the four-year intifada, which has only increased Palestinian suffering. "There is a trend which believes in non- violent struggle," Ziad Abu Amr, a former minister said, "but I don't think the Israelis are interested in it ... It is very difficult to copy the types of struggle which occurred in India in the context of the Israeli occupation."

<p>Eyad Sarraj, a leading Gaza psychiatrist and human rights campaigner, doubted whether it was a starter. "There's so much hatred, so much thirst for revenge. It would be very difficult to channel this anger into a non-violence path."

<p>London-trained Dr Sarraj said the perceived failure of the intifada made it less likely than ever. "Arab culture is about an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, especially so now. People feel they have not achieved victory by violence. Going for non- violent resistance would look like a form of surrender."

<p>Palestinians at the rally were split on the idea of non-violence. "The peaceful resistance he talks about is better than what we have here," said Mohammed Saber, 25. But Mahmoud Suleiman, aged 15, said: "There must be armed and peaceful resistance - armed is more important."
