The World Council of Churches (WCC) told U.S. member  churches in a letter that they should not ask whose side God  was on in an election but only offer "a moral and spiritual  compass for their community, their nation and the world."<p> 
			
			The letter by WCC General Secretary Rev. Samuel Kobia  chided some U.S. churches for presenting God in partisan terms.<p> 
			
			It was released late on Wednesday.<p> 
			
			Preachers in some U.S. churches, mostly among conservative  evangelical Protestants but also some Catholics, made clear  during the campaign that they preferred President Bush over his  Democratic challenger Senator John Kerry.<p> 
			
			U.S. experts said that Bush's Republican Party had made an  unprecedented effort to court church-going voters and that some  churches had played a new role in the election by closely  twinning politics and religion.<p> 
			
			And analysts of the vote said Bush built his election win  on a coalition of older, white, church goers in a race where  voters were more likely to cite "morality" as their top concern  rather than war on terror.<p> 
			
			Kobia said many people around the world had watched in  recent months "with great interest how churches shape a  powerful nation's stance toward the world.<p> 
			
			"The harsh claims that make most of the headlines, that  invoked the judgment of a partisan God, have provoked deep  concern around the world," he wrote.<p> 
			
			"We do not ask whose side God was on in this election.  Rather, like Abraham Lincoln when he confronted a divisive war,  we seek to be found on God's side."<p> 
			
			The Geneva-based WCC joins 342 churches from 120 countries  in all Christian traditions but the Roman Catholic Church.<p> 
			
			It took no stand on the U.S. candidates, both of whom  stressed their Christian faith to voters, and wished the United  States "God's grace and peace."<p>
