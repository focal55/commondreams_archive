Bev Harris was already tired and running late. She'd just driven 18 hours - alone, from Northern California to Seattle - and had trouble finding parking.<p> Lost in the cavernous King County Courthouse on a Friday in mid-May, the 52-year-old free-lance writer, literary publicist and Renton mother was anxious to get to an important hearing. <p> <!--/beginimage/-->

That morning, Superior Court Judge Julie Spector was hearing a motion by attorneys for Republican Secretary of State Sam Reed to throw out a lawsuit by Harris' friend and a hopeful challenger to Reed, Democrat Andy Stephenson, over electronic voting machines. The suit was thrown out. <p> By 3:30 p.m., she would have to catch a flight at Sea-Tac Airport, which meant there wasn't much time for a cup of cappuccino or the umpteenth interview with yet another newspaper reporter.<p> "It's not my favorite part of the job," she said.<p> Such is life today for Harris, who in the last 1 1/2 years has become known nationally as the leading critic of the touch-screen, electronic voting machines that are quickly replacing optical scanning systems and traditional paper ballots in elections departments around the country.<p> In her quest, she's been called everything from "heroic" to "paranoid." The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Vanity Fair, Seattle Times, Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Seattle Weekly have written about her. She's been interviewed by radio and television stations throughout the nation and has become one of the country's best-known voting watchdogs.<p> Her book, "Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century" - copies of which she carried with her into the hearing - outline her argument. <p> Harris believes one of the most hallowed of rights accorded citizens, the right to vote, is in peril. In some countries where despots rule, ballot-stuffing has been a regular problem over the years, requiring international observers to ensure the process is fair.<p> But, Harris wrote, she was shocked to discover that far from the world of tin-pan dictatorships, her own country faces the potential for ballot tampering. Not from stuffed ballot boxes, but by manipulation of those high-tech voting machines that were supposed to make life so much easier for everyone. 
<p> She's doing her best, she said, to let the public know why and what can be done about it.
<p>



<b>No paper, no accounting</b>
<p> The popularity of touch-screen voting machines accelerated after the 2000 presidential election, particularly as a result of the problems over hanging, pregnant and dimpled "chads" on ballots tabulated in Florida counties. <p> If paper ballots were problematic, paperless voting machines would surely make for smoother, more reliable elections. At least that was the argument.<p> The uproar that ensued led Congress to enact the Help Americans Vote Act in 2001. Part of that new law required states to use touch-screen voting machines.<p> But the Florida fiasco wasn't really what caused the United States to begin purchasing thousands and thousands of touch-screen voting machines, Harris asserts, in her book, published this year. That experience was simply used as leverage by lobbyists and voting machine salespeople to convince Congress the nation needed their paperless contraptions.<p> "By rights," she wrote, "we should demand an immediate moratorium on electronic voting, returning to paper ballots, hand-counted if necessary, until we solve underlying problems ..."<p> In the early 1990s, optical scanning systems became more prevalent in elections. These machines used scanners to tabulate shaded boxes on ballots. Harris said that system is not infallible, but the real danger lies with the newest generation of voting machines.<p> These touch-screen systems are made by companies like Diebold Inc., which rose to prominence producing automated teller machines. But unlike ATMs, the newfangled voting boxes are paperless, leaving no hard copy behind.
<p> In previously published articles, Harris said her alarm bells really began ringing in January 2002 when, while visiting a politically left-leaning Web site, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org" target="_new">www.commondreams.org</a>, she read an article by Lynn Landes that said no one knew who owned voting-machine companies. 
<p> Harris then began her own research, which led her to Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska who happened to be part owner and a former CEO of one of the voting machine companies, Election Systems and Software Inc.<p> Her curiosity piqued, she began researching elections where touch-screen voting machines, officially called "direct recording electronic voting systems," or DREs, were used. <p> She discovered what she says was a pattern of Republican upsets in political races and incidences of malfunctioning equipment.<p> And because the machines left no paper trail, there was no way to audit the election results and determine whether there were software glitches.<p> As part of her research, Harris also stumbled upon the kind of information most journalists could only dream of finding. She ran across the source code - the computer language directives - on the Internet for machines produced by Diebold. <p> With this information, she said, ostensibly any software programmer with a political ax to grind, or a financial interest, could hack the touch-screen machines. And the code was floating around in cyberspace, where anyone could find it.<p> "It became apparent in a few weeks we had a huge, huge problem that wasn't being addressed," Harris said. "I have always looked at this as an accounting problem, not a technology problem."<p> Her discovery began a chain of events that made Harris a celebrity and would force her to abandon her Renton-based publicist business. It even led, as reported by Seattle Weekly in May, to the U.S. Secret Service demanding that she turn over the Internet addresses of everyone who registered at her Web site, www.blackboxvoting.org.<p> "I'd rather be on the other side of it," she said of her growing fame.<p> Throughout it all, the companies manufacturing touch-screen voting machines have steadfastly maintained the machines are secure. But Harris has been joined by a chorus of computer scientists who have raised concerns about the source codes used for touch-screen voting machines and their susceptibility to being hacked. 
<p> There have been congressional hearings in Washington, D.C., and the states of California and Ohio have adopted laws requiring touch-screen voting machines to produce a paper printout that can be checked for accuracy.
<p> <b>'Not a pushover'</b>
<p> Harris' hectic schedule has her virtually on the go seven days a week. When she's not doing research, she's being interviewed, or asked to speak at a forum, or to appear in court. <p> She's just started three months of research, and though she declined to say where she was going on that flight out of Sea-Tac, she did say she'd be looking into the money trail behind voting machines.<p> "I want to know who made the decisions and who shook hands with who," she said.<p> Harris contends she doesn't believe some far-flung conspiracy is deliberately trying to manipulate elections. Instead, she's more concerned about individuals who see an opportunity to tamper with touch-screen voting machines since they can't be audited via a paper trail.<p> "A lot of people misquote me and think I'm all about some party trying to rig the presidential election," she said. 'It's really about incremental opportunities."<p> Harris' ties to Renton go back seven years. That's when she married David Dudley, a Boeing Co. employee, amateur actor and Machinists Union member. <p> Harris touched on her African-American husband's family history in the opening lines of her book. <p> "My people died for the right to vote," Harris quoted him as saying. "I will vote for who I want, and no one's going to stop me."<p> Dudley, whom Harris refers to by his nickname, Sonny, said though he's originally from North Carolina, his parents settled in Renton about 30 years ago. <p> His wife's busy schedule and her frequent travel have been a challenge.<p> "A lot of times," he said, "we're passing ships in the night. We have to make a conscious effort to make time for each other. We just kind of make sure we do things together. Plus, I'm usually her sounding board for a lot of these things, anyway."<p> Harris has family ties to the Midwest, though she was raised in Redmond and graduated from Redmond High School in 1969.<p> Both were divorced when they met "by accident," Dudley recalled. They were introduced by Harris' daughter from a previous marriage.<p> Dudley said they clicked because of Harris' feistiness.<p> "She was not a pushover," he said. "I couldn't dominate her. Basically, that was it. I wanted a person who was intelligent and would not let me walk over her."<p> Both have children from previous marriages. Harris' daughter is a reporter with the Los Angeles Times and her son recently graduated from the University of Illinois/<p> Champaign-Urbana. <p> Dudley has a married, 20-year-old daughter and a son who's about to graduate from high school.<p> Family connections have supported Harris emotionally the past two years, Dudley said, providing the passion that fuels her efforts. <p> "It's about her family," he said. "It's about families. Her family has a history of caring about average people. I remember her father, who is like, very, very proud of his daughter. When he first had the book in his hands, he was very emotional about it and actually shed a tear over it. He said he was very proud. It was quite moving."<p> Harris left some things out of her book, Dudley said.<p> "She didn't mention it in the book, but when she stumbled onto this story - I'm into genealogy - we were researching her background and how (President George W.) Bush was related to her. That's how this started."
