So says the activist street-theater group <a href="http://billionairesforbush.com/index.php" target="_new">Billionaires for Bush</a>, which began in New York last year and has branched out to 60 chapters nationwide.
<p>	Dressed to the nines in tuxedos and flowing evening gowns, about a dozen pseudo-bluebloods gathered at the Old West Church on Wednesday in mock tribute to the president and vice president.
<p>	"We want to celebrate all the things Bush has done for us," said Phil T. Rich, noting $1.1 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent and no-bid contracts to mega-corporations.
<p>	"We're all winners under this administration. Just some of us more than others," continued the top hat-wearing, cigar-smoking Rich, who, when he's not in character, is New York artist Andrew Boyd.
<p>	At the church, the Billionaires joined 10 other grassroots groups, including the League of Pissed Off Voters, DemSwingers and Mainstreet Moms Oppose Bush, with one aim - to defeat the Bush administration in the fall.
<p>	<p>	Of course, the Billionaires take a little different approach.
<p>	The evening before, they turned heads outside the FleetCenter with hundreds of make-believe money bags. "No justice, no problem," they yelled as they hoisted signs that read, "Leave No Billionaire Behind," "Wealth Care Is A Basic Human Right" and "Privatize Everything."
<p>	<p>	"At first, people don't know how to take us and they do a double take," said Boyd, joined at the church by fellow faux billionaires Mimi Nottieu and Monet Oliver d'Place. He said that head-scratching moment was exactly what the group wanted.
<p>	"We create a sense of curiosity, with people trying to figure out if we are real or fake. It's an open-mind moment when people take the time to consider our message," he said. "We're using humor to spotlight the truth about the Bush administration."
	
<p>	On Wednesday the Billionaires announced their "Get on the Limo" tour, taking their protests to the so-called battleground states. Boyd said his group would shadow the Bush campaign and hold "rallies for the really rich."
<p>	The group will conclude its limo caravan in New York in time for the Republican National Convention, and will stage a Million Billionaire March on Aug. 29.
