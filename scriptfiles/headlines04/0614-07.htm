<p>WASHINGTON  - The refusal of a jury in Oklahoma to  impose the death penalty on bombing conspirator Terry Nichols  demonstrates again the inconsistency in the way capital  punishment is applied in the United States, anti-death penalty  activists said on Monday.<p> 
			
			Nichols was convicted on May 26 on 161 murder counts for  his role in the April 1995 bombing of a federal building in  Oklahoma City. But the jury deadlocked on Friday during the  punishment phase after three days of deliberations.<p> 
			
			Jurors said the four member of the panel who opposed the  death penalty were influenced by Nichols' jailhouse conversion  to Christianity. His lawyers presented evidence that he had  become an avid reader of the Bible who spent many hours in  religious study and prayer.<p> 
			
			"It really testifies to the inconsistency in the way the  death penalty is applied. You get guys executed for killing one  person and yet here you have a man convicted of a mass murder  who ends up not getting the death penalty," said David Elliot  of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.<p> 
			
			Nichols' former Army buddy and co-conspirator Timothy  McVeigh was put to death in 2001 for triggering the home-made  truck bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building  in downtown Oklahoma City.<p> 
			
			The number of death sentences handed down in the United  States has fallen from around 300 a year in the late 1990s to  around 150 a year now, according to figures compiled by the  Death Penalty Information Center.<p> 
			
			"There's been a much stronger hesitancy around the country  to apply the death penalty and prosecutors are less likely to  seek it," said Richard Dieter, the center's director.<p> 
			
			LIFE SENTENCES<p> 
			
			He cited three other recent high-profile cases that did not  result in capital punishment:<p> 
			
			In March, Lee Boyd Malvo received life without parole for  his role in the October 2002 Washington-area sniper killings,  largely because he was a juvenile at the time of the 10  murders. His accomplice, John Allen Muhammad, was sentenced to  death.<p> 
			
			In April, Charles Cullen, a former nurse who claimed to  have killed 40 patients by giving them lethal doses of  intravenous drugs, pleaded guilty to 13 murders in a deal that  allowed him to escape the death penalty in New Jersey.<p> 
			
			In December, serial killer Gary Leon Ridgway received life  without parole for 48 murders in the state of Washington.<p> 
			
			University of Virginia law professor Richard Bonnie said he  was skeptical that these cases represented a trend, although he  agreed they demonstrated the inconsistencies in the application  of capital punishment.<p> 
			
			"Public opinion has been influenced by a drop in crime  rates as well as recent cases highlighting mistakes that were  made. People are feeling more secure. But if there was a  significant increase in crime, you would probably see support  for the death penalty go up again," he said.<p> 
			
			Recent polls suggest U.S. support for the death penalty has  fallen from a high of around 80 percent in the early 1990s to  around 65-70 percent now.<p> 
			
			When respondents are given a choice between the death  penalty and life without parole as the most appropriate  punishment for murder, opinion is almost evenly divided.
