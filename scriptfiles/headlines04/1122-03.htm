<p>The three-decade-old system for preventing the spread of nuclear arms may be eroding irreversibly as the spread of technology for producing weapons fuel circulates among smaller powers, experts warn, signaling that a quiet, low-scale arms race may be taking shape.

<p>Despite occasional positive news, there are numerous ill omens. European diplomats appeared to score a success last week by persuading Iran to freeze its programs for enriching uranium, the heart of nuclear bombs. But a range of specialists said the success could prove temporary because Iran still has the know-how to transform peaceful facilities for creating reactor fuel into weapons plants. And the administration of President Bush charged over the weekend that Iran was hastily enriching a large amount of uranium before the freeze, which Iranian officials said would take effect today.

<p>Not only do Iran and North Korea have the capability to make the fuel, the experts warn, but so do several dozen other countries -- from Brazil, Japan and South Korea to Turkey, Syria and Egypt.

<p>As a result, after decades of nonproliferation policies based on the idea that the global community could prevent the spread of nuclear weapons by controlling nuclear materials and technology, such containment strategies may no longer be possible, these experts reluctantly agree.

<P>The concern is that legitimate facilities, built to develop what is called the nuclear fuel cycle, could be used to increase the concentrations of enriched uranium or for processing plutonium to make weapons-grade fuel. Not only is the technology for these processes widely available to countries rich and poor, but some of the equipment needed for the job, such as high-powered computers and precision machine tools, can now be purchased easily, experts say.

<p><strong>Lack of faith
</strong>
<p>"Even if you take this out of the context of North Korea and Iran, at this point you have a fundamental lack of faith in the system that secured us for the past 30 years," said Jon Wolfsthal, a former U.S. nuclear inspector and now deputy director of the Nonproliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "We are ending up in the exact world we were trying to avoid for the past 30 years. Nuclear weapons are increasingly available and valuable in international affairs, and the fuel cycle issue is making it worse."

<p>Added David Smith, a former arms-control negotiator under the first President George Bush and now chief operating officer of the National Institute for Public Policy, a conservative Washington think tank, "Maybe in some ideal world where the sky is a different color, maybe you can stop the spread, but in my world there are just too many competing interests, too much technology that is already out there. What you can do is make it more expensive, harder to do, to get the bad guys from obtaining nuclear weapons."

<p>In a recent interview with The Chronicle, Mohamed ElBaradei, director- general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.-affiliated body that has tried to halt nuclear proliferation with its monitoring and inspection system, called the widely distributed facilities for developing the fuel cycle "latent bomb plants."

<p>"We are really headed in a really dangerous path, in my view," he said.

<P><strong>The numbers
</strong>
<p>"The Nuclear Tipping Point: Why States Reconsider Their Nuclear Choices," published recently by the Brookings Institution, examines in detail how many countries may be starting down this dangerous path. The book analyzes the situations in Egypt, Syria, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, looking at their incentives for turning fuel cycle or research plants into bomb plants.

<p>Peaceful uses of nuclear facilities include energy production, medicine and research. But both inside and outside the U.S. government, many experts now call ostensibly peaceful nuclear fuel facilities "virtual nuclear arsenals, " because those same programs can quickly become the heart of a weapons program.

<p>"I think the sense that things are not going well is shared by a lot of people because of these programs," said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a leading Washington think tank on nuclear weapons issues.

<p>Albright calls himself an optimist, believing that inspections and persuasion can still prevent wider proliferation, but, he conceded, "we've reached a point where if we don't solve some of these problems, it becomes overwhelming."

<p>Some of these fuel cycle programs have been covert, and some in the open. Iran, for instance, had violated the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by concealing some aspects of its program to build a fuel cycle -- a uranium enrichment facility. And some opponents of the fundamentalist regime have claimed the government is still hiding weapons facilities, though they have produced no evidence so far.

<p>But most of Iran's efforts have been done legally, and the government has said that, under the deal with the Europeans, it would only suspend, not dismantle, its fuel cycle program. Iran says its nuclear facilities are intended only for peaceful purposes, but the Bush administration has generally insisted that the program has to be permanently shut down.

<p>It is unclear how much that would matter.

<p><strong>Countries of concern
</strong>
<p>Currently, nine countries -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea -- possess, or are suspected of possessing, nuclear weapons. ElBaradei said that within a decade or so, as many as 40 countries will have the ability to make fuel, and thus warheads. He suggested that, no matter the outcome of the deal with the Europeans, Iran has essentially crossed the nuclear weapons threshold.

<p>"Iran has developed every aspect of the fuel cycle. ... I'm saying they have the know-how," ElBaradei said.

<p>Most of the recent efforts by the United States, the United Nations and the major industrialized countries in halting the spread of nuclear weapons have focused on what are regarded as the key vulnerabilities -- the large, poorly guarded stocks of weapons-grade material in the former Soviet bloc countries or rogue scientists from nuclear-armed countries selling their know- how on the black market, as happened in Pakistan.

<p>Now there is growing concern over an alternative scenario -- exploiting fuel-cycle technology.

<p>Nearly four decades ago, the global powers agreed to a world-wide containment approach to prevent the proliferation of weapons technology. The big five powers of the Cold War era, the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China, would maintain their nuclear monopoly. In return, other countries would be given access to what at that time was regarded as peaceful nuclear technology, in the form of reactors and other facilities, so long as they were opened to international monitoring.

<p>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which took force in 1970, did appear to help prevent a rapid spread of weapons. But the seeds of today's problem were spread widely as numerous countries obtained reactors and experimented with the fuel cycle.

<p><strong>Newcomers
</strong>
<p>Experts worry now that some countries, fearful over the success of Iran and North Korea in enriching fuel, could push their own programs, igniting an arms race. If North Korea's bomb program is not shut down, for instance, neighboring countries with fuel cycle technology -- Taiwan, South Korea and Japan -- might take the next step and build warheads.

<p>South Korea, which has large commercial and research programs, recently admitted that it had secretly experimented with uranium enrichment, in violation of its treaty obligations. The South Korean government said the experiments were done by scientists without official approval, but North Korea seized on the disclosures to argue that it needed to maintain its programs.

<p>"If North Korea conducts a test and breaks into the nuclear club, and if Iran completes facilities for enriching or reprocessing, the whole set of nonproliferation constraints will unravel quickly, maybe even explode," said Graham Allison, a senior Defense Department official in the Clinton administration and author of "Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe."

<p>During the presidential campaign, both Bush and Sen. John Kerry said in their first debate that the spread of nuclear weapons was the greatest security threat facing the United States.

<p>In a speech last February, Bush said no new countries should be permitted to develop fuel cycle capabilities. But he has not offered any specific new policies, other than an initiative to seize illicit shipments of equipment or material on a case-by-case basis.

<p>ElBaradei and some others have proposed the creation of a multilateral consortium that would take control of all fuel enrichment facilities, perhaps under U.N. supervision. Countries with peaceful nuclear reactors would be guaranteed access to fuel at reasonable prices, as long as it was properly monitored, but no new countries would be allowed to develop fuel cycle technology.

<p>Many experts say a greater sense of urgency is needed. Raymond Jeanloz, a UC Berkeley physics professor who in January will become chairman of the Committee on International Security and Arms Control at the National Academy of Sciences, said the issue is a frequent topic among scientists knowledgeable about weapons programs.

<p>At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of America's primary warhead design labs, the Center for Global Security Research, a think tank and advisory body, is devoting most of next year to an intensive series of forums and studies of latent proliferation.

<p>In May, the fuel cycle problem is expected to be an important topic at a conference in New York, where the 189 signatory countries will review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and consider whether it needs to be updated.

<p><strong>Bush critics
</strong>
<p>Some critics of the Bush administration's record have insisted that the United States needs to play a more active role in trying to halt fuel cycle programs, in Iran and elsewhere. For instance, the administration has raised no objections to Brazil building an active fuel cycle, which it says is for commercial and peaceful purposes, even though that country has resisted opening all its facilities to full inspections by ElBaradei's agency.

<p>The United States has said that since Brazil is regarded as a friendly and peaceful country, the program is not dangerous. But critics say the Bush administration has to be more consistent and treat all such programs as a threat.

<p>"In the end, the big loser in all of this is the U.S.," since nuclear weapons are the only devices that can defeat America's overwhelming conventional military superiority, said Wolfsthal of the Nonproliferation Project.

<p>"Fifteen to 20 more countries could develop this technology in a decade," he said. "It's disturbing, almost horrifying, but not unrealistic."

<p>Some conservatives argue that it is already too late. The United States needs to focus, therefore, on stamping out programs only in the hands of perceived foes -- for example, Iran, Libya and North Korea -- and not worry about allies and friends.

<p>"There's no answer, no solution that's practical," said Fred Ikle, for years a senior arms control negotiator and a well-known neoconservative. "It's hard to get the horses back in the barn. One should work to slow it down as much as possible. That's all you can do."
<p><strong>NUCLEAR WEAPONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
</strong>
<p>Nine countries have acknowledged or suspected nuclear weapons programs. Others, including some nations that have abandoned their weapons programs, are suspected of maintaining nuclear fuel cycles — that is, the capability to produce nuclear fuel that could be used for peaceful purposes or be further processed for nuclear weapons..

<p>-- Countries with confirmed nuclear weapons

<p>United States: 10,500 nuclear warheads

<p>Russia: 20,000 warheads, half of which are deployed

<p>China: 400 warheads

<p>France: 450 warheads

<p>Britain: 185 warheads

<p>India: 65 warheads

<p>Pakistan: 30-50 warheads. The head of its nuclear weapons program was fired in February for secretly supplying nuclear technology to North Korea, Libya and Iran..

<p>-- Countries with unconfirmed nuclear weapons

<p>Israel: 110-190 (projected number) warheads; has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferaton Treaty (NPT).

<p>North Korea: 2-9 (projected number) warheads; announced its withdrawal from NPT in January 2003..

<p>-- Countries reported to be pursuing development of nuclear programs

<p>Algeria, Syria: Suspected intentions to produce nuclear weapons, but no nuclear weapons programs have been identified.

<p>Iran: Suspected of pursuing uranium enrichment and nuclear weapons programs since the 1970s. After disclosures by opponents of the regime, Iran admitted to having secret centrifuge facilities for producing highly enriched uranium, and last week agreed to freeze its enrichment program, at least temporarily, while negotiations continue..

<p>-- Countries that have disbanded nuclear weapons programs

<p>Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan: Inherited nuclear weapons at the breakup of the Soviet Union, but returned the weapons to Russia and signed the NPT as nonnuclear weapons states.

<p>Argentina: Admitted only that it conducted unsafeguarded uranium enrichment and reprocessing.

<p>Australia, Egypt: Ended their programs before they signed the NPT.

<p>Brazil: Ended weapons program before 1970. Admits having a nuclear fuel cycle, but has resisted allowing U.N. nuclear weapons inspectors broader access to its nuclear facilities.

<p>Iraq: Nuclear weapons program started in the early 1970s, but was effectively halted in 1991 by Security Council-mandated inspections. In 1998, Saddam Hussein refused to allow inspections to continue and was suspected of resuming a nuclear weapons program. But the final report by U.S. weapons inspectors, released in October, said Iraq did not have such a program at the time of the U.S. invasion in March 2003.

<p>Libya: Agreed in December 2003 to abandon its nuclear program, including centrifuges and bomb designs provided by a rogue Pakistani scientist. It disclosed its history of trying to build the nuclear fuel cycle in return for a promise that Western countries would lift trade sanctions.

<p>Romania: Former Warsaw Pact country once had a plutoniumseparation program.

<p>South Africa: Abandoned its program before it signed the NPT in 1991, but maintains stockpiles of plutonium and highly enriched uranium under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.

<p>South Korea: Program ended after 1970. Disclosed recently that its scientists had secretly conducted a plutonium-based experiment in 1982 and a uranium enrichment project in 2000.

<p>Spain: May have had an unacknowledged nuclear weapons program under the previous military dictatorship.

<p>Sweden: Had a program that was essentially ended by the time it signed the
NPT.

<p>Taiwan: Ended its program after 1970.

<P>Yugoslavia: The former communist government had a program that was ended after 1970.. -- Sources: Nuclear Threat Initiative; Center for Defense Information; Monterey Institute for International Studies; “Global Nuclear Stockpiles, 1945- 2000,” by Robert Norris and William Arkin; Institute for Science and International Security; Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, March/April 2000; BBC News; United Nations (disarmament.un.org); additional research by Chronicle librarian Lois Jermyn
THE ROAD TO A NUCLEAR BOMB

<p>Building a nuclear bomb requires either highly enriched uranium or plutonium, and both can be produced with reactors and other nuclear facilities intended for use in research or for commercial purposes..

<p>Commercial power reactors generally use fuel that has a 3 percent to 5 percent concentration of uranium 235, the same material used in bombs. Most of the remainder is another variation of the material, an isotope called uranium 238. Any fuel with a concentration of more than 20 percent U235 is considered highly enriched, but for bombmaking purposes a concentration of 80 percent or higher is considered optimal.. -- ENRICHING URANIUM PLUTONIUM

<p>There are several methods for enriching uranium, but the most common involves turning the uranium into a gas called uranium hexafluoride, and feeding it into a long series of tall, narrow centrifuges, together known as a cascade. Each centrifuge spins the gas into higher concentrations of U235. . -- The Process

<p>1. Uranium gas is fed into the middle and circulates in the chamber.

<p>2. Subjected to centrifugal force thousands of times greater than gravity, a fraction of the uranium becomes depleted of U235.

<p>3. The depleted uranium is spun toward the outer wall and falls to the bottom.

<p>4. Another fraction of the uranium, enriched in U235, is collected in the top of the chamber.

<p>At the end of the process, the enriched gas is turned back into a solid,and the highly enriched U235 is turned into a metallic state, which is used for bombs.. -- PLUTONIUM

<p>Plutonium is a by-product of nuclear reactor operations. Once the reactor fuel is spent, it is dissolved in hot nitric acid, and then a procedure known as reprocessing can begin. Through a series of chemical steps, uranium can be extracted from this nuclear soup, as can another isotope, plutonium 239. When the plutonium 239 is removed and purified, it is turned into a metal, a bomb-making material.. -- STOPPING THE PROCESS BEFORE ENRICHMENT

<p>Many countries have several different kinds of fuel cycles, producing both enriched uranium and plutonium, but most countries stop the enrichment processes before weapons-grade materials are obtained. These facilities, if built legally, are monitored closely by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA conducts regular inspections to make sure no nuclear materials are diverted and that the fuels are not enriched to weapons quality.
