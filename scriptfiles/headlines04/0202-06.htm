<p> WASHINGTON - The Bush administration on Monday
proposed a 2005 budget for the Environmental Protection Agency
which is down more than 7 percent from levels Congress enacted
in 2004, but includes more money to clean up toxic waste sites
while slashing funds for clean water projects by about &#36;500
million.

</table><!--/endimage/-->President Bush's proposed &#36;2.4 trillion election-year
budget includes &#36;7.76 billion for EPA, the agency charged with
keeping the nation's air, water and land pollution-free.
Proposed funding is down from the &#36;8.4 billion that Congress
allocated for EPA in the current budget year.
 <p>
 EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt, who is nearing the 90-day
mark after taking the reins of the agency from Christine
Whitman, said the budget allocates "substantially more money"
than prior years.
 <p>
 "With the President's budget, we can increase the velocity
of environmental protection," Leavitt told reporters.
 <p>
 Leavitt pointed to a &#36;133 million boost from EPA's 2004
request of &#36;7.63 billion to remove toxic sludge from the Great
Lakes and make school buses burn cleaner fuel.
 <p>
 However, some lawmakers and environmental groups criticized
the budget as hindering U.S. environmental initiatives.
 <p>
 "This budget not only shortchanges our environment, it
challenges our nation's role as a global environmental leader,"
said independent Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont.
 <p>
 "Congress will not let this stand," said Jeffords, the
ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, which has oversight over some EPA programs.
 <p>
 In a statement, Jeffords pointed out that the budget cuts
&#36;492 million, or 37 percent, from a revolving fund which states
use to upgrade sewage and septic systems and storm-water
run-off projects.
 <p>
 The administration would hold steady a separate &#36;850
million state fund for clean drinking water.
 <p>
 Funding for Superfund -- an industry program to clean up
toxic waste sites -- would increase by about 10 percent to
&#36;1.38 billion. EPA will complete clean-ups at about 40 sites
this year, and begin work at up to 12 new U.S. sites in 2005,
according to budget documents.
 <p>
 However, Jeffords said the numbers were down from levels
seen during the second term of the Clinton administration, when
the EPA cleaned up an average of 87 sites per year.
 <p>
 The National Environmental Trust (NET), an environmental
group, said that Superfund should not gain at the expense of
clean water programs.
 <p>
 "Clean water or toxic waste -- as if Congress is going to
choose one over the other in an election year. At best, expect
the status quo," said NET President Philip Clapp.<p align="CENTER">Copyright 2004 Reuters Ltd<p>
