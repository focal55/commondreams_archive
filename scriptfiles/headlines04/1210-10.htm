<P>OTTAWA — The Supreme Court of Canada gave its blessing Thursday to the federal government's proposal to legalize same-sex marriage, prompting Prime Minister Paul Martin to launch a high-stakes sales job to push the legislation through a divided Liberal caucus and split Parliament.

<P>The court said that the power to change the definition of marriage lies exclusively with the federal government, not the provinces, and that a proposed bill to legalize same-sex marriage is constitutional and fits smoothly within the evolution of the law. It also said churches cannot be forced to perform same-sex marriages.

<P>But the court refused to state categorically whether it agrees with lower courts that the traditional man-woman definition of marriage is unconstitutional. That would have amounted to an unequivocal declaration that same-sex marriage must inevitably be the law of the land, unless MPs use the notwithstanding clause to override the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

<P>Instead, the court deftly handed the politically explosive issue back to Parliament and put the onus to proceed with legislation on Mr. Martin.

<P>The Prime Minister said Thursday that he would go ahead, insisting that his legislation is the only real option to prevent a patchwork of marriage rights across Canada.

<P>He noted that courts have made same-sex marriage legal in six provinces and said his government will not allow the use of the notwithstanding clause to turn the clock back.

<P>“We will not permit the balkanization of marriage across the country. The only other choice — or the other choice, in any event — is to invoke the notwithstanding clause to deny a Charter right. And that, we will not do.”

<P>Passing the same-sex marriage legislation would make Canada only the third country to make marriage for gays and lesbians the law of the land. Belgium and the Netherlands already allow same-sex marriage.

<P>Mr. Martin said he believes the bill will pass in the deeply split House of Commons because MPs will realize the alternative is the dramatic step of using the notwithstanding clause to overrule the Charter.

<P>“I think that what the House is going to have to look at, quite clearly, are what are the alternatives? One of those alternatives is the use of the notwithstanding clause. I don't think that that's where Canadians want to go. I don't think they want to see governments taking away their rights.”

<P>However, Conservative Leader Stephen Harper argued that the court's refusal to state whether the traditional definition of marriage is unconstitutional was a “tremendous victory.” He said that means it is not necessary to use the notwithstanding clause if Parliament chooses to reaffirm the traditional definition of marriage.

<P>“They're trying to make an argument that you had to vote a certain way constitutionally. They simply do not have those arguments,” Mr. Harper said. “Every member of Parliament is going to have to stand up and vote with his or her conscience.”

<P>The Supreme Court's opinion left the government a clear field to finally table its same-sex marriage bill, which Mr. Martin promised to do soon after Parliament resumes in January.

<P>“Our Constitution is a living tree, which by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life,” the court said. Not only does the proposed law conform with the Charter or Rights, the court said, “it flows from it.”

<P>The court said that giving an opinion on the traditional definition of marriage could have created doubt and legal chaos surrounding thousands of gay marriages that have taken place in six provinces and one territory where appellate courts have struck down common-law prohibitions on gay marriage.

<P>It would also have been superfluous, the judges said, since the federal government had signalled its intention to bring in same-sex legislation.

<P>“The government has clearly accepted the rulings of lower courts on this question and has adopted their position as its own,” the court said. “An answer would not only fail to ensure uniformity of the law but might undermine it. The results would be confusion, not uniformity.”

<P>The court stated that religious figures cannot be forced to perform gay marriages against their will but that the provinces retain jurisdiction over technical aspects of marriage involving the conduct of ceremonies and their solemnization.

<P>Human-rights codes will also be interpreted in such a way as to respect the broad right of religious freedom, the court added, and any province that compels religious officials to provide same-sex marriages “would almost certainly run afoul of the Charter guarantee of freedom of religion.”

<P>Mr. Harper said that a “compromise” can still be reached in Parliament that would see the traditional definition of marriage reaffirmed but non-marriage civil unions created for gays and lesbians. The court ruled that civil unions are exclusive provincial jurisdiction, however, and that although they can be created by provinces, they are completely separate from the federal right to define marriage.

<P>Religious spokesmen took some solace from the court's responses Thursday. They said they can apply renewed pressure to politicians for a countrywide referendum on gay marriage and to vote against the proposed government legislation.

<P>“We are pleased to see it being pushed back into the public debate for political resolution,” said Janet Epp Buckingham, a lawyer for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. “I am hoping this decision will really push provincial governments to take action to protect religious freedom.”

<P>However, gay-rights activists were insistent that any attempt to hold back gay marriage inevitably will fail in light of the strong wording the court used to affirm the exclusive federal right to legislate on the definition of marriage and a steady wave of court rulings across the country in favour of gay marriage.

<P>“It is now finally time for the government to act,” said Martha McCarthy, a lawyer for several of the couples who began the litigation that led to Thursday's reference case.
