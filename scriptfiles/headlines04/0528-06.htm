LOS ANGELES - Hollywood activists unveiled a TV  ad on Thursday to air over Memorial Day weekend accusing  President Bush and the oil industry of robbing Americans at the  gas pump.
<p> 
			
			<a href="http://www.americansforfuelefficientcars.org/" target="_new">The Detroit Project</a>, founded by political columnist Arianna  Huffington and Laurie Davis, the wife of HBO's "Curb Your  Enthusiasm" star Larry David, funded the 30-second ad that is  scheduled to appear on cable television starting on Friday,  along with a print ad in the New York Times.
<p> 
			
			The spot is the latest in the Detroit Project's effort to  galvanize Americans to demand stricter fuel economy standards  and to wean the nation from foreign oil dependence.<p> 
			
			Laurie David said the $100,000 campaign was planned for the  first weekend of the summer driving season to capitalize on  motorists' anger at rising gas prices.<p> 
			
			"One of the reasons we are doing this ad is to connect the  dots between the current administration and what's happening at  the gas pump," David said. A Gallup Poll released this week  showed that while Americans said record gas prices caused them  hardship, only 5 percent blamed Bush or corporate greed.<p> 
			
			The commercial, unveiled at a Los Angeles news conference,  shows a woman standing at a gas pump watching the spinning  dials as she fills her sport utility vehicle's tank.<p> 
			
			She looks stunned as the pump shows $3.5 million in "Oil  Company Contributors to Bush Campaign," $125 billion in "Record  Profits for Oil Companies," and $48 billion in "US Tax Dollars  Defending Middle East Oil" instead of her $50 gas purchase.<p> 
			
			As she replaces the gas nozzle, the price gauge reads: $0.0  for "Bush-Cheney Solutions to America's Oil Addiction."
