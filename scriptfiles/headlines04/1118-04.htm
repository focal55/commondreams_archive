      <p>GENEVA   - People around the globe largely mistrust  their political leaders and nearly half fear the world will be  less safe for their children, according to a survey issued on  Thursday.<p> 
			
			The survey, carried out in 60 countries by the Gallup  International polling organization for the Swiss-based World  Economic Forum, also found that business leaders have a better  image than the politicians -- but not by a huge margin.
      <p> Worldwide, 63 percent of the 50,000 people questioned believe politicians 
        are dishonest while 43 percent think the same term applies to business 
        leaders, according to the survey, titled "<a href="http://www.voice-of-the-people.net/" target="_new">The 
        Voice of the People</a>."
      <p> 
			
			Some 52 percent feel politicians behave unethically, and 39  percent believe the same of business chiefs. But while 39  percent think politicians are not capable or competent, only 22  percent viewed their business counterparts in the same way.<p> 
			
			Least trusted by their peoples, the survey indicated, are  the political leaders of Latin America, West Asia and Africa  with dishonesty ratings of 87 percent for the first, 84 percent  for the second and 82 percent for the third.<p> 
			
			Although in Western Europe as a whole 46 percent of the  survey sample described their politicians as dishonest, in  Germany 76 percent held that view, while 70 percent of Germans  thought business leaders were dishonest too.<p> 
			
			By contrast, across the border in France, where cynicism  about political life has been long viewed from outside as rife,  only 36 percent saw their politicians as dishonest and only 27  percent described them as unethical.<p> 
			
			IRAQ WAR EFFECT<p> 
			
			In Britain, 72 percent feel that "politicians respond to  people more powerful than themselves" -- possibly reflecting  disapproval of Prime Minister Tony Blair's support for  President Bush over Iraq, survey compilers said.<p> 
			
			The figure for Western Europe as a whole was 58 percent.<p> 
			
			In North America, covering the United States and Canada, 50  percent of the sample felt political leaders are dishonest, and  47 percent believe business leaders behave unethically. The  survey as issued by the Forum gave no other details or  breakdown for the two countries.<p> 
			
			It said Ecuador returned the highest dishonesty rating, 96  percent, followed by Mexico with 93 percent, Nigeria with 92  percent, Peru, Bolivia and India with 91 percent -- and new  European Union member Poland with 90 percent.<p> 
			
			At the other end of the scale, only three percent of those  surveyed in Singapore saw their political leaders as dishonest,  12 percent in the Netherlands and 13 percent in Malaysia.<p> 
			
			The survey found 45 percent of the sample around the globe  -- and 46 percent in the United States -- predicting a less  safe world for future generations, of whom nearly one third  thought life would be "a lot less safe" in years to come.<p> 
			
			In Western Europe, this view was expressed by 55 percent of  the sample -- up to 63 percent in Germany.<p> 
			
			But in Africa, scene of some of the worst natural disasters  and civil conflicts of the last decades, optimism was stronger  with 50 percent saying the world would be safer and only 30  percent expecting less security.<p>
