<p>A showdown is taking shape over the nation's organic food standards, 
triggered by a spate of recent rule changes that some producers and activists 
say are setting a pattern that could eventually render the organic label 
meaningless. 
<P>The changes in the National Organic Program standards, made in April, 
expand the use of antibiotics and hormones in organic dairy cows, allow more 
pesticides in the organic arsenal and for the first time let organic livestock 
eat potentially contaminated fishmeal.
<P>Program administrators also reversed themselves and said seafood, pet 
food and body care products can use "organic" on their labels without meeting 
any standards at all.

And in what the $11 billion organic food industry, consumer and farm 
groups call a dangerous precedent, program administrators made last month's 
changes in three "guidances" and one "directive" without seeking public 
comment or consulting with their own advisers on the <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/nosb/index.htm" target="_new">National Organics 
Standards Board</a>. 
<P>"This is hugely terrible for the organic industry," said Nancy Hirshberg, 
a vice president at Stonyfield Farm, a New Hampshire organic dairy whose 
yogurts are sold in the Bay Area. "It's a real weakening of the standards. And 
it could have the effect of weakening consumer confidence in the organic label.
"
<P>A coalition of organic interests, including the powerful Consumers Union, 
says the interpretations represent major changes that could threaten the 
integrity of the program, which set a high standard for what products qualify 
as organic. And they say administrators risk undermining trust in the program 
by leaving the public, including its own advisory board, out of the decision-
making.
<P>Sounding a national alarm, the coalition is pressuring the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture to retract the changes and keep the public involved. 
<P>In both the House and Senate, letters calling on Agriculture Secretary 
Ann Veneman to withdraw the documents are gathering bipartisan support. And 
businesses that will lose money because of the changes are said to be 
considering lawsuits. 
<P>"We are drawing a line in the organic soil," said Bob Scowcroft of the 
Organic Farming Research Foundation in Santa Cruz, who helped write the 
organic standards. 
<P>Barbara Robinson, the USDA deputy administrator in charge of the organic 
program, defended the moves as merely interpretations of the standards, not 
new regulations. Among the 90-plus USDA-accredited organic certifiers, some 
were interpreting the standards one way, some another, she said. For example, 
some were allowing dairy farmers to use antibiotics in certain circumstances, 
and some weren't.
<P>"We want it to be consistent," she said in an interview. In an earlier 
statement, she put it this way: "The statements simply say what is enforceable 
under the existing regulation and statute and what is not. There is nothing 
new, just an attempt to be clear about what is covered."
<P>The board wasn't involved because the guidances didn't set new standards, 
she said. Decisions needed to be made, and Robinson said she has only six  
staff members and $1.5 million, out of the USDA's $70 billion budget, to run 
the entire organic program. 
<P>If people don't agree with the staff, she added, "the fix is to petition 
the department to change the regulation. That can be done."
<P>The National Organic Standards Board was told of the changes just the day 
before they were announced and responded with a letter expressing its strong 
concerns.
<P>"The board was totally caught by surprise,'' said vice chair James Riddle,
who has written to demand that the directives be withdrawn. "They certainly 
weaken the regulations." 
<P>The new pesticide rule allows the use of some pesticides that contain 
unidentified inert ingredients if a "reasonable effort" has been made to 
identify them. Before, the ingredients had to be approved before use.
<P>The livestock rule allows organic beef cattle and poultry sold for their 
meat to eat non-organic fishmeal, even if it contains a synthetic preservative 
or toxins. The standards require organic feed, but fishmeal is allowed as a 
feed supplement.
<P>A major change was defining of the scope of organic standards to say 
seafood, pet food and personal care products simply aren't covered. Previously,
the program said they were, though standards for them had not yet been 
written. Businesses have been built around the promise that if they followed 
organic principles, they eventually could be certified.
<P>For example, an organic shrimp farmer from Florida invested $1.5 million 
in raising organic fish to feed the shrimp, based on the previous policy, 
Riddle said. The new rule pulled the rug out from under him, and now anyone 
can call fish organic as long as they don't use the USDA's organic seal.
<P>"It was a complete reversal," Riddle said.
<P>At Stonyfield Farm organic dairy, Hirshberg said  she has seen many 
guidances and clarifications from the program since the organic standards went 
into effect 11/2 years ago, but the latest series were "a turnaround. In the 
past they weren't true departures."
<P>When it came to using antibiotics in an organic dairy, she said, 
"everyone understood that once you treat with antibiotics, a cow can't be 
brought back into the (milking) herd" under the 2001 standards. But some 
certifiers had allowed antibiotics under certain circumstances. 
<P>Under the new standard, cows and calves can be treated with antibiotics, 
or growth hormones or any other drug, as long as a year goes by before their 
milk is sold as organic.
<P>The organic standards are based on the principle that cows should be 
raised in healthy, disease-preventive ways so drugs aren't needed, Hirshberg 
said. The new rule makes it easier for large dairy farms that have both 
organic and non-organic herds to move cows back and forth between the two.
<P>"That's not what organic is about," she said.
<P>Beyond that, many organic milk labels say "no antibiotics, no hormones," 
and consumers expect that to mean the milk comes from cows raised without such 
drugs, said Liana Hoodes of the National Coalition for Sustainable Agriculture,
about three-dozen groups that monitor the organic standards.
<P>Both the program administrators and the organic coalition fighting the 
changes agree that the rules need to be clear as more businesses jump into the 
organic market. Organics are the fastest-growing segment of the food industry, 
rising at more than 20 percent a year.
<P>In Santa Cruz, Nell Newman, president and co-founder of Newman's Own 
Organics, said, "I think we have to fight to maintain the standards with their 
true and original intent. Unfortunately it's a waste of time and energy to 
have to fight with our overseeing agency, the USDA."
<P>On Capitol Hill, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who wrote the 1990 organic 
food act, is gathering bipartisan support for a letter demanding retraction of 
the changes.
<P>"Unilateral fiats like these may violate the letter of the law, and they 
certainly violate the spirit," Leahy said.
<P>A draft of a similar letter to Agriculture Secretary Veneman circulating 
in the House expresses "strong concern" that the "far-reaching" changes will 
"undermine the integrity of the organic label." 
<P>Consumers Union and the Organic Consumers Association have revved up e-
mail and letter-writing campaigns. And the Organic Trade Association, which 
represents 1,400 organic producers, are muscling up their lobbying in 
Washington.
<P>Santa Cruz's Scowcroft, among others, said it's conceivable some of the 
new rules  --  especially the one affecting body care products  --  would have 
been reached even if the program had consulted its board and the public to 
resolve ambiguities in the rules.
<P>But its failure to do so means "that the validity of these practices is 
questionable," Scowcroft said. "The precedent has to stop."
<b>Points of contention
</b>
<P><b>Pesticides:</b> Now, some pesticides can be used even if they contain unknown 
inert ingredients if a "reasonable effort" has been made to identify them. 
Before, the ingredients had to be approved before use.
<P><b>Livestock feed:</b> Now, organic cattle and poultry sold for their meat can 
eat non-organic fishmeal, even if it contains a synthetic preservative or 
toxins. Before, only organic feed was allowed. The fishmeal is allowed in any 
quantity as a "feed supplement."
<P><b>Antibiotics in dairy cows:</b> Now, calves and cows can be treated with 
antibiotics or any other necessary drug, if other means of helping them have 
failed, but a year must pass before their milk is sold as organic. Before, 
most dairies interpreted the rule to mean that a cow treated with antibiotics 
had to be removed from the herd forever (they were sold to conventional 
dairies), but some certifiers allowed drug use with a 12-month hold on the 
milk.
<P><b>Scope of organic standards:</b> Now, any seafood, pet food and body care 
products can be called organic without meeting any standards other than their 
own. That's why the USDA hasn't objected to things like "organic" salmon in 
fish markets. Before, the three groups were included under the organic law 
although specific standards hadn't been written to cover them; some won 
organic certification by following the rules for livestock and crops.</P>
