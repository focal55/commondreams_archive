<p>UNITED NATIONS - As the world's foremost advocate
of democracy, the United States is trying its best to avoid a
one-person-one-vote in Iraq -- at least for this year.
<p>
 The irony is not lost on Shiite followers of Iraq's most
influential cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who question why
the United States agitates for the ballot box around the world
but not in Iraq.
<p>
 "Clearly Sistani fears it could lead to a less than full
representation of the Shiite majority," David Malone, head of
the International Peace Academy think-tank and a former
Canadian U.N. ambassador, said.
 <p>
 And the United Nations  basically agrees with the Bush
administration. "There is a perception that early elections
tend to favor extremists rather than the moderates," one senior
U.N. official said.
 <p>
 "One thing the United Nations has learned from the early
1990s is that a well-run election requires a great deal of
planning and even then the U.N. cannot guarantee violence-free
elections," Malone said.
 <p>
 Secretary-General Kofi Annan  is expected to send an
electoral team into Iraq this month to study the practicality
of direct elections or recommend alternatives, as requested by
the United States and the Iraqi leaders. The group will go in
after a report from a U.N. security mission, expected to arrive
in Baghdad this week or next.
 <p>
 But most diplomats say they believe a second mission would
have to follow to mediate. Washington would like Lakhdar
Brahimi, who has just finished a two-year stint as U.N. chief
envoy in Afghanistan, to negotiate. However, the former
Algerian foreign minister has so far declined.
 <p>
 Brahimi was invited to the White House for talks on
Thursday with senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of
State Colin Powell.
 <p>
 Current procedures call for caucuses in 18 provinces to
choose an interim assembly, although this may be modified to
get Sistani's support. The assembly will select an interim
government by June 30 after which Iraqis are to write a
constitution and hold general elections by the end of 2005.
 <p>
 U.S. and U.N. officials have cited the short time available
for a general election before June 30, with voter registration
rolls nonexistent, even though many Iraqis are on lists for
food rations under the former U.N. oil-for-food program.
 <p>
 U.S. envoys are talking about a phased transition to allow
for time to build institutions, form political parties and
create alliances that cut across tribal and religious groupings
in an atmosphere free from violence.
 <p>
 ALTERNATE PROPOSALS
 <p>
 One problem with the current election plan, analysts say,
is that few can explain the caucus procedure, thereby raising
suspicions Washington wants to make room for exile leaders and
others who could not win in their own right.
 <p>
 Among alternate suggestions is a hybrid system: elections
in municipalities for two thirds of delegates who would then
nominate representatives for the assembly. The U.S.-selected
Iraqi Governing Council would choose the rest.
 <p>
 "The discussion, which has been stimulated by Ayatollah
Sistani, is whether there could be an element of elections
injected into the earlier part of the process," British Foreign
Secretary Jack Straw said in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday.
 <p>
 Allies of Sistani have said he would respect the U.N.
recommendations, although near-daily demonstrations for direct
elections by his followers might take on a life of their own.
 <p>
 But Annan is cautious about how much the world body can do
before June 30, saying the United Nations needs "clarity," a
euphemism for independence from occupation authorities.
<p>
 "The real issue is how on June 30 the Americans can hand
over power to an interim government that Kurds, Shiites and
Sunnis can live with. And it is on that point that Sistani is
looking for United Nations assistance," Malone said.
