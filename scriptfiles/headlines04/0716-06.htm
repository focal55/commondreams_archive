<p>Ministries of the Iraqi government who are now able to spend billions in oil revenues lack proper auditing and financial controls, opening the door to widespread corruption, an international oversight body warned yesterday. </p>
<p> The oversight body, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board on Iraq, also criticized American occupation authorities for lax accounting of their own as they spent nearly $20 billion in Iraqi funds through late June this year, when sovereignty was formally transferred to the interim government.</p>
<p>The overseers said they had seen no evidence of fraud in the spending of Iraqi money by American authorities after the invasion in March 2003. But they complained that the Pentagon, despite repeated requests, had not provided details about a noncompetitive contract awarded to the Halliburton Company last year, which provided $1.4 billion in Iraqi funds for the importing of fuels.</p>
<p> The monitoring board is scrutinizing the use of the Development Fund for Iraq, which includes leftover billions from the prewar Oil for Food Program, postwar oil revenues and Iraqi assets seized abroad.</p>
<p>The funds are separate from the $18.4 billion appropriated by Congress to aid Iraqi reconstruction, little of which has been spent. </p>
<p>Under rules approved by the United Nations, the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority used Iraqi funds for repairs of oil facilities, construction and other good-will projects requested by military commanders, fuel imports and other purposes. The international board was set up to monitor spending of the development fund - initially by the coalition authority and, since June 28, by the interim Iraqi government.</p>
<p> Critics have long complained about secrecy and a lack of accountability in the authority's use of Iraqi funds. "We don't even know who's getting the contracts," said Svetlana Tsalik of Iraq Revenue Watch, a project of the Open Society Institute in New York.</p>
<p>Ms. Tsalik and others also criticized the Pentagon for rushing to allocate most of Iraq's accumulated oil profits before June 28, rather than leaving decisions to the new Iraqi government.</p>
<p>At a news conference yesterday in Washington that was broadcast live on the Internet, board members described their concerns and the results of an audit for 2003, carried out by the accounting firm KPMG.</p>
<p>"The auditors haven't reported any evidence of fraud," said Jean-Pierre Halbwachs, an assistant secretary general of the United Nations and chairman of the oversight board, referring to the Coalition Provisional Authority's spending. "But the fact that there are weaknesses could lead to fraudulent activities."</p>
<p>The overseers drew special attention to the poor monitoring of Iraqi oil pumping and sales, a continuing problem. An absence of meters in the country's oil fields makes it impossible to verify how much oil has been pumped and American officials agree that significant quantities had been smuggled, especially in the initial months of the occupation.</p>
<p>The board members, four senior officials of international financial bodies, expressed sharp displeasure over the Pentagon's failure to provide information about the award to Halliburton, which has come under fire for waste and overcharging in several large American contracts. </p>
<p> In April, and several times since, the board asked the Pentagon for details of the Halliburton contract and for the results of what the Pentagon has described as its internal audit.</p>
<p>"As time goes by, the members of the board become a bit impatient," said Bert E. Keuppens, a board member and senior adviser to the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>The board said it was trying to determine whether to conduct its own investigation of the the Halliburton and other noncompetitive contracts. </p>
<p>As it continues to scrutinize last year's spending, the board also expressed concern about Iraq's ability to track its oil revenues - which account for nearly all the government's budget - in the years ahead.</p>
<p>"There are many indications that controls in the spending ministries are very weak," Mr. Keuppens said.</p>
<p>To fight corruption, Iraq has established a Board of Supreme Audit. Its chief, who had met with the international overseers and earned their respect, was recently assassinated.</p>
