<p>UNITED NATIONS  - 


Syria on Monday accused Israel
of inciting the United States to invade Iraq  to distract
attention from its own actions in the region, where it retains
its grip on the Palestinian territories won in a 1967 war.
<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara used his country's
annual address to the U.N. General Assembly opening debate to
deliver a fierce critique of Israeli policy, as the Jewish
state accused Damascus of "directing terrorism" and threatened
preemptive strikes against militants on its territory.

<p>Shara accused Israel of refusing to comply with 40 Security
Council resolutions and hundreds of General Assembly
resolutions demanding that Israel withdraw from the Palestinian
territories as a step toward a Middle East peace. Washington
had used Baghdad's noncompliance with U.N. resolutions as one
of its rationales for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq.

<p>Instead, Shara said, Israel had built up a nuclear arsenal,
expanded Jewish settlements on Palestinian lands, built a
"racist segregation wall," which Israel says is intended to
keep out suicide bombers, transformed its army into "armed
gangs bent on systematic killings and war crimes" and shunned
the peace process, "despite the hand extended in peace by the
Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese."
<p>Hours before Shara spoke, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister
Zeev Boim called Syria "a central junction in regional
terrorism" and accused Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of
being involved in it "as a traffic officer."
<p>Syria had earlier accused Israel of terrorism after a
Palestinian Hamas militant died in a car bombing on Sunday in
Damascus.
<p>The United Nations  had been of little help in resolving the
Arab-Israeli conflict, which was as old as the world body
itself, Shara said.
<p>Despite the adoption of over 600 resolutions on the
subject, Israel "did not implement a single one of them, and
continues to find protection inside and outside the United
Nations," he said.
<p>"We are convinced that success in this endeavor will remain
elusive unless these resolutions are implemented and peace is
restored in accordance with the aspirations of the people of
the region and the world," he said.</p>
