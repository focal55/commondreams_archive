<p>WASHINGTON - Vice President Dick Cheney  probably
did not intend to direct millions of television viewers to a
Web site calling for President Bush's defeat but that's what a
slip of the domain achieved.
<p>Anyone who heeded Cheney's advice and clicked on
"<a href="http://www.factcheck.com" target="_new">factcheck.com</a>" on Wednesday morning was redirected to the site
of anti-Bush billionaire investor George Soros that had a
banner message saying "Why we must not reelect President Bush."
<p>The GeorgeSoros.com site later put up a notice saying that
it does not own factcheck.com and was not responsible for
directing readers from that site to the Soros message. "We are
as surprised as anyone by this turn of events," it said.
<p>A lawyer for the factcheck.com site was not available for
comment.
<p>Defending his record as Halliburton's chief executive,
Cheney said in the Tuesday night debate that Democratic
vice-presidential challenger John Edwards was trying to use
Halliburton as a smokescreen. Any voter who wanted the facts,
Cheney said, should check out factcheck.com -- which led to the
Soros site.
<p>The Web site Cheney had in mind, <a href="http://www.factcheck.org" target="_new">factcheck.org</a>, was not
amused when the vice president proved that he was not master of
the factcheckers' domain.
<p>Factcheck.org, run by the Annenberg Center of the
University of Pennsylvania, said on its site on Wednesday that
Cheney not only got the domain name confused, he had
mischaracterized its fact-finding.
<p>"Cheney ... wrongly implied that we had rebutted
allegations Edwards was making about what Cheney had done as
chief executive officer of Halliburton," the site said on
Wednesday.
<p>"In fact we did post an article pointing out that Cheney
hasn't profited personally while in office from Halliburton's
Iraq  contracts, as falsely implied by a Kerry TV ad. But
Edwards was talking about Cheney's responsibility for earlier
Halliburton troubles. And in fact, Edwards was mostly right."
<p>The White House Web site annotated the debate transcript,
parenthetically noting that Cheney meant factcheck.org, not
factcheck.com. It linked the transcript to factcheck.org.<p align="center">&copy; 2004 Copyright Reuters</p>
