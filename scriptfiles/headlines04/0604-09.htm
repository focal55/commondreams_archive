BEIJING&nbsp; - China has unveiled ambitions to become a global wind power within the next decade, grasping a chance to "leapfrog" over more polluting forms of energy, environmental group Greenpeace said Thursday. 

<p>

 

China has just published an action plan which foresees renewable energy sources accounting for 10 percent of the nation's total installed electricity capacity by 2010, Greenpeace said in a statement.

 

<p>

 "This is a golden opportunity," said Lo Sze Ping, campaign director of Greenpeace in China.

 

<p>

 "If China is able to fully utilize its immense renewable energy resources, it can leapfrog over the polluting fossil fuel age straight into a clean renewable energy future," he said.

 

<p>

 China already seems well into the fossil fuel age, with auto sales soaring 29 percent in the first three months of 2004 to 1.28 million.

 

<p>

 China targets 60 gigawatts coming from renewable energy sources by the end of the decade, including four gigawatts from wind power and six gigawatts from biomass, Greenepace said.

 

<p>

 The group did not say where the majority of the renewable energy would come from.

 

<p>

 Hydropower is likely to account for a large part, although environmental organizations generally do not welcome such projects if they are too large to be sustainable.

 

<p>

 China's roaring economy demands ever-larger amounts of energy, meaning policy planners have to look either abroad or investigate alternative energy sources to meet demand.

 

<p>

 As an indication of China's huge appetite for power, the country last year overtook Japan as the world's second-largest importer of oil after the United States.
