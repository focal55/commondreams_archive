<p>CARACAS, Venezuela  — Hugo Chávez, the president of Venezuela, feels grossly misunderstood.</p>
<P>
Mr. Chávez, who has been fending off a recall referendum, admits he is baffled that so many people —  particularly the Bush administration —  seem to dislike him so intensely.   Nearly a decade after he left prison, where he was sent for plotting a coup, followed by elections in 1998 that brought him to the presidency and a rewriting of the Constitution,  he does not grasp why he has not won a democrat's credentials.</p>
<P>
Why, he asks, is the United States, the  neighbor and customer that is the cultural touchstone for so many of his people, seeking to  drive him from power? He would like to know why the Bush administration is sowing rumors that he is, take your pick:  encouraging  insurrection in Bolivia, supporting  rebels  in Colombia, colluding with   Fidel Castro and, most distressingly, plotting class warfare and disenfranchising the middle and upper classes of his country.</p>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there has been no way of talking with this administration," he said in an interview Saturday at the presidential palace. "They don't respect us. I'm tired of trying to carry out the mandate of Christ, turning the other cheek. I've been slapped so many times, my cheeks are purple."</p>
<P>
Bush administration officials say  Mr. Chávez is responsible for his own undoing and they   stand by all the charges he accuses them of spreading. They say his hunger for total power and his contempt for Venezuela's ruling class have pushed him to the tipping point. Even though one chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court overturned a decision by his government to disqualify more than 800,000  signatures on Monday, Mr. Chávez is pressing his case with another chamber of the  court.  </p>
<P>
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said earlier this month,  "We think that all those people who signed petitions that their rights need to be respected."</p>
<P>
With the American-assisted ouster of Haiti's president last month still reverberating in the region, the tensions with Washington have added urgency. The idea that an elected leader, one who challenges the elite by mobilizing a desperately poor, neglected population, could be "kidnapped" by American officials and whisked from his country is an unsettling precedent for Mr. Chávez.</p>
<P>
In a four-hour interview with The New York Times, arranged at his  request, he portrayed himself as a moderate, tolerant leader locked in a political war with his country's elite and above all with the national news media.  "They have been employed in media terrorism —  inciting hatred, racism, calling on people not to recognize the official government, even calling on people to assassinate the president," he said. </p>
<P>
If Mr. Chávez's ambitions include totalitarian control, even an infrequent visitor to Venezuela can see that he has fallen short after five years in power. His "Bolivarian revolution" has failed so far to improve stubborn indexes    of misery, with unemployment officially at 20 percent and poverty still rising, from 60 to 70 percent, according to statistics by Andrés Bello Catholic University.</p>
<P>
Petróleos de Venezuela, the national oil company, which is known by the acronym Pdvsa and has long been a cash cow for the elite, was devastated by a strike last year. Although it claims to have restored its production level of nearly three  million barrels a day, Mr. Chávez's efforts to redistribute that wealth are scarcely seen.</p>
<P>
There is an improvised air to the Chávez government, and its roots appear wide but weak. Pdvsa (pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah), which accounts  for  73 percent of the country's  export earnings, was taken over last year by Chávez loyalists, who remain baffled by its byzantine processes. "We're still trying to figure out how Pdvsa works," said one Chávez adviser.</p>
<P>
The government's United Nations ambassador, Milos Alcalay, resigned this month, saying  "every day the government is more authoritarian." But Mr. Chávez  is clearly beloved by the working class, who tell of small improvements in their daily lives —  a paint job for a dilapidated home or free access to roaming clinics staffed by Cuban doctors.</p>
<P>
Opposition leaders say their efforts have managed to keep Mr. Chávez in check. But the cost has been high. Venezuelan soldiers and policemen  killed nine people and tortured others during a week of protests this month by opposition groups supporting the recall, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch.</p>
<P>
Mr. Chávez  told reporters the torture allegations were made up,  and he accuses  the opposition of   sabotage —  work stoppages, destroying the oil-exporting infrastructure and the coup of 2002, when he  was ousted by military officers and opposition leaders for 47 hours. "The government of Bush was the first to recognize the coup," he noted ruefully. </p>
<P>
The opposition, long divided, has found common purpose in an attempt to remove the president through the recall referendum.</p>
<P>
Mr. Chávez, after some prodding, conceded that a recall vote was all but inevitable. But he said his government would  continue to scrutinize every signature. The government's current strategy relies on  persuading the Supreme Court chamber responsible for constitutional issues to override the chamber responsible for electoral issues.</p>
<P>
The recall dispute hinges on a technicality: many on the recall lists did not fill out their own forms, though they provided signatures and thumbprints. That, the president says, is a clear violation of the rules.</p>
<P>
Mr. Chávez, 48,  is the child of schoolteachers and  fancies himself a teacher despite his background as a  paratrooper. He jumps up from an interview to draw maps and graphs on a blackboard, and thumbs through dog-eared  revolutionary texts.</p>
<P>
He looks and talks like the long-silent majority of lower-class Venezuelans. His most palpable legacy may be that he has taught the poor to demand more.  That, said  Maximilien Arlevaiz, an aide, is something that the dark-skinned Mr. Chávez  will not be forgiven by the whiter-skinned elite. </p>
<P>
He is self-absorbed but affable, and he interrupts the interview to talk to his 6-year-old daughter on the phone. "Hello, my queen," he said. "How are you, my life? How's the pig? Is she any bigger now? I'm going to send you a thousand kisses."</p>
<P>
But he brooks little opposition, critics say. "With him, you can't talk," Gabriel García Márquez, the author, told El Universal. "He lives accelerated, and it's not worth it, since he doesn't admit ideas that are different from his own."</p>
<P>
While he seems genuinely worried about his relations with Washington, he asserts that any effort to remove him by force would be calamitous for the United States.  "We aren't going to accept it," he said, warning,  "The price of oil will go up to $50 a barrel."</p>
<P>
"I thought since Bush came from an oil family, and given his political trajectory, that we would understand each other," he said. "I can't believe that a government is willing to put at risk its supply of oil."</p>
