<p>AUSTIN &#8211; Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader is getting a little help from his friends &#8211; and from George W. Bush's friends.</p>
    <p>Nearly 10 percent of the Nader contributors who have given him at least $250 each have a history of supporting the Republican president, 
      national GOP candidates or the party, according to computer-assisted 
      review of financial records by <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>.
    </p>
 <p>
      Among the new crop of Nader donors: actor and former Nixon speechwriter 
      Ben Stein, Florida frozen-food magnate Jeno Paulucci and Pennsylvania 
      oil company executive Terrence Jacobs. All have strong ties to the GOP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Democrats have warned that Mr. Nader's entry in the race could help Mr. 
      Bush by drawing votes from John Kerry. Some analysts say Mr. Nader's 
      third-party candidacy four years ago siphoned off Democratic voters and 
      cost Vice President Al Gore the White House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Republicans are well aware that Ralph Nader played a spoiler role in 
      the 2000 election. And there is no reason why they wouldn't want to 
      encourage and help him do so again in 2004,&quot; said Jano Cabrera, a 
      spokesman for the Democrat National Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spokesman for the Bush campaign declined to comment on Mr. Nader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;We're focused on our campaign. We're focused on generating support for 
      Republican candidates,&quot; said Danny Diaz, referring inquiries about Nader 
      fund raising to his donors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Republicans who have given to Mr. Nader offered a variety of 
      explanations, including a desire to provide voters a choice in November 
      and to highlight the consumer advocate's issues. Some donors said they 
      were miffed by efforts, primarily Democrats, to keep Mr. Nader off the 
      ballot.
    </p>
    <p>
      None said their donations were designed to boost Mr. Bush's chances in 
      the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Did I give $1,000 to Ralph Nader because I hope and believe he will be 
      president? No,&quot; said California business executive Charles Ashman. &quot;I 
      don't believe that any more than Ralph Nader does. But I was offended to 
      see this campaign to squelch him from being a candidate.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ashman said he remains a staunch Republican. He contributed $2,000 
      to the Bush campaign, the maximum allowed for the general election, 
      according to records.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;I proudly made a contribution to the re-election of President Bush 
      because I support him 100 percent,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope and believe he will 
      be re-elected.&quot;
    </p>
    <p><b>'Spoiler' label</b></p>

    <p>
      Mr. Nader has dismissed the &quot;spoiler&quot; label Democrats have given him, 
      saying he expects this time to draw equally from both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2000, Mr. Nader was on the ballot in 43 states and the District of 
      Columbia and got 2.7 percent of the vote nationwide. Experts say he was 
      a deciding factor in two states, Florida and New Hampshire, both of 
      which Mr. Bush won by razor-thin margins.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Kerry spokesman declined to discuss Mr. Nader.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to campaign finance reports, Mr. Nader raised $930,000 through 
      February. During the same period, Mr. Bush had raised $158 million and 
      Mr. Kerry $41 million.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than 24 Nader contributors of $250 or more &#8211; about 10 percent of 
      his total &#8211; are otherwise reliable GOP donors, <i>The News</i> 
      review found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paulucci, the creator of Chun King and Jeno's Pizza Rolls, donated 
      $2,000 in February to Mr. Nader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Florida frozen-food executive is a prolific contributor to the GOP, 
      giving more than $150,000 to the Republican Party and national 
      candidates since 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paulucci described himself as a independent and said he also has 
      supported Democrats, including those in his native Minnesota. Most of 
      his money in federal races has gone to Republicans, records show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paulucci said he met Mr. Nader in Minnesota some years ago in 
      connection with a tax issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;I saw him on TV. I thought I would give the guy a little bit of 
      encouragement,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't think for a moment that this is going 
      to help Bush. No, that was not my thought.&quot;
    </p>
    <p><b>Ben Stein's money</b></p>
    
    <p>
      As for Ben Stein's money, the television personality and outspoken 
      advocate for the Republican Party has contributed $500 to Nader and 
      $1,000 to Mr. Bush this year. Records indicate that over the last 
      decade, Mr. Stein has given exclusively to the GOP.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Stein agreed to make TV ads for Mr. 
      Bush, although they were never aired. He did not return telephone calls 
      seeking comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others helping Mr. Nader with $2,000 checks are Robert Monks, who lost a 
      Senate race in Maine, and his wife, Millicent. Both have a long history 
      of contributing money to Republicans and are financially backing Mr. 
      Bush's re-election.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel Hartnett, a self-described conservative who operates a plumbing 
      business in Sioux City, Iowa, said his $250 to Mr. Nader was not meant 
      to help Mr. Bush. He said he agrees with some of Mr. Nader's views.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four years ago, Mr. Hartnett supported Mr. Bush, and although he hasn't 
      contributed to his re-election this year, that's where his loyalties lie 
      in November.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;I'm a Republican,&quot; he said. &quot;If Mr. Bush comes out and takes a good 
      hard conservative stand on a few issues that I care about, I'll probably 
      send him $2,000.&quot;
