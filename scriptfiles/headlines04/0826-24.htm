<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some 1.3 million Americans slid into  poverty in 2003 as the ranks of the poor swelled to 35.9  million, with children and blacks worse off than most, the U.S.  government said on Thursday in a report sure to fuel Democratic  criticism of President Bush.
<P>
Despite the economic recovery, the percentage of the U.S.  population living in poverty rose to 12.5 percent -- the  highest since 1998 -- from 12.1 percent in 2002, the Census  Bureau said in its annual poverty report. The widely cited  scorecard on the nation's economy showed one-third of those in  poverty were children.
<P>
The number of U.S. residents without health care coverage  also rose last year to the highest level since 1999 and incomes  were essentially stagnant, the Census Bureau said.
<P>
The poverty line is set at an annual income of $9,573 or  less for an individual, or $18,660 for a family of four with  two children. Under that measure, a family would spend about a  third of its income on food.
<P>
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has argued  Bush's economic stewardship, including three rounds of tax cuts  since 2001, has done more to help wealthy Americans than the  poor or middle class.
<P>
But analysts have said the poverty rate typically tracks  the broad economy, rising during a recession and falling in  boom times. America has struggled to recover from the 2001  slump, and job creation has lagged behind overall growth.
<P>
The poverty rate has risen each year since 2000, when it  was 11.3 percent. It hit a record low 11.1 percent in 1973.
<P>
Children and most racial minorities again fared worse in  2003 than the overall population, according to the Census  report. The rate of child poverty rose to 17.6 percent from  16.7 percent in 2002 -- boosting the number of poor children to  12.9 million.
<P>
The poverty rate of African Americans remained nearly twice  the national rate, with 24.4 percent of blacks living below the  poverty line in 2003, nearly unchanged from 24.1 percent a year  earlier.
<P>
The report showed real median income for all races was  unchanged at $43,318 in 2003, while the number of Americans  with no health care coverage rose to 45.0 million from 43.6  million in 2002.
<P>
Democrats criticized the government's decision to release  the highly anticipated report in mid-August -- when many people  are on vacation -- rather than sticking to the usual September  release. They also said the decision to release both the health  insurance and poverty statistics in the same report was a bid  to minimize media coverage of the worsening lives of the poor.
<P>
"Hmmmm. We wonder if these moves have anything to do with  the fact that George Bush is running for re-election. Remember,  the last time that the annual census figures were released in  August was in 1992 to hide bad news in an election year," the  Kerry campaign said in a statement.</p>
