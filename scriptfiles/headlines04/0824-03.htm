<p>JERUSALEM   - Israel declared its hospitals  off-limits on Tuesday to the 2,800 Palestinians on hunger  strike in Israeli prisons, saying they could be treated in  makeshift facilities behind bars if taken ill.<p> 
			
			"I am not prepared for there to be a situation where the  lives of patients and medical teams are endangered in our  hospitals as a result of us having to admit these murderers,"  Health Minister Danny Naveh told Army Radio.<p> 
			
			"If a field hospital has to be set up at a Prisons Service  installation, then that is what should be done," Naveh said.<p>

Israeli Public Security Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, like Naveh  a member of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's right-wing Likud  party, said last week he didn't care if the prisoners starved  to death.<p> 
			
			Seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance to Israeli  occupation, the inmates at 10 jails are refusing food to force  wardens to stop strip searches, allow more frequent family  visits, improve sanitation and install public telephones.<p> 
			
			Israeli officials call the liquids-only fast that began on  August 15 a ploy by prisoners to secure easier communication  with militant groups waging a four-year-old Palestinian revolt.<p> 
			
			About 7,000 Palestinians taken into custody in security  sweeps are held by Israel. Among the inmates are those who  openly identify with Islamic groups sworn to its destruction,  and thus elicit little sympathy among the Israeli public.<p> 
			
			Hisham Abdel-Razek, the Palestinian minister for prisoners  affairs, called Naveh's comments "inhuman and arrogant."<p> 
			
			"Israel is behaving like a state above the law and Israeli  ministers are acting as if they are above Israeli law,"  Abdel-Razek told Reuters.<p> 
			
			A Prisons Service spokesman said Israel had warned the  prisoners in a leaflet they could be force-fed if critically  ill, but that daily examinations found no serious health  problems yet.<p> 
			
			"None of the prisoners has required anything more than  basic health care," the spokesman, Ofer Leffler, said. "In  fact, at least 124 of the prisoners have already broken the  strike."<p> 
			
			Businesses and government offices across the West Bank and  Gaza Strip, which Palestinians want for a state, closed on  Tuesday in a show of solidarity with the prisoners. Many of  their relatives are also fasting.<p> 
			
			HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP CHALLENGE<p> 
			
			A leading human rights group said jailors may have  accelerated the debilitating effects of the fast by  confiscating salt and other canteen products from striking  prisoners' cells.<p> 
			
			"Salt is important," said Shabtai Gold of Physicians for  Human Rights-Israel, which has offered to monitor strikers.  "People have died from this ... In the upcoming period, if the  strike continues, there will be health problems."<p> 
			
			The Prisons Service said withholding inmate privileges was  among tactics learned from Britain's handling of hunger strikes  by jailed Northern Irish militants in the 1970s and 1980s.<p> 
			
			Officials said they also planned to barbecue meat outside  the cells to try to break the prisoners' spirit.<p> 
			
			Challenging Naveh, Gold said: "If the prisoner is at the  stage of needing medical care, how dangerous can he be? I don't  know. You have security guards ... They can put them in a  special ward, in a separate room.<p> 
			
			"But they have to allow them into the hospital."
