<p>UNITED NATIONS  - Russia's U.N. ambassador said
late on Monday his country was never sure Iraq  had weapons of
mass destruction, despite assertions from former U.S. arms
inspector David Kay that "we were almost all wrong."
<p>
 The furor over whether Iraq possessed unconventional
weapons, a justification for the U.S.-led war, recently flared
again after Kay said he believed there were no large stockpiles
of chemical and biological weapons in Iraq.
<p>
 Russian ambassador Sergei Lavrov, at his annual meeting
with the press, said that Russian officials repeatedly
maintained they did not have enough information.
<p>
 "We said that we don't have information which would prove
that the WMD, weapons of mass destruction, programs remain in
Iraq. We also said we don't have information that those
programs have been fully stopped," Lavrov said.
<p>
 Consequently, he said he supported a Security Council
resolution in November 2002 giving "an unprecedented, intrusive
mandate to U.N. inspectors and that is why we wanted the
inspectors to finish their job."
<p>
After Kay told Congress on Jan. 28, "we were almost all
wrong," many U.S. and British officials said that members of
the U.N. Security Council, as well as United Nations 
inspectors, got it wrong also.
 <p>
 Russia opposed the war and at one time was Iraq's closest
ally on the Security Council. Lavrov said Moscow believed U.N.
inspectors provided an objective evaluation.
 <p>
 But Russia bitterly criticized the U.N. Special Commission,
the inspection unit that worked in Iraq in 1998, before the
U.N. arms experts were withdrawn on the eve of a U.S. bombing
raid. They were not allowed to return until late in 2002 after
the United States threatened an attack.
 <p>
 Lavrov said the current U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission, known as UNMOVIC, could perhaps analyze
any information the United States weapons hunters found.
 <p>
 "If remnants are there, could be revived, we want to make
sure they are eliminated. We don't want some wrong groups in
Iraq to lay their hands on WMD in Iraq, if there are any,"
Lavrov said.
 <p>
 But he said that Iraq could not be a long-term job for
UNMOVIC. Solutions should be found to retain the expertise of
the commission, particularly on biological arms and ballistic
missiles, for which there were no international inspection
mechanisms.
