WASHINGTON  - Vice President Dick Cheney blurted  out the "F word" at Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont  during a heated exchange on the Senate floor, congressional  aides said on Thursday.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->The incident occurred on Tuesday in a terse discussion  between the two that touched on politics, religion and money,  with Cheney finally telling Leahy to "f--- off" or "go f---  yourself," the aides said.<p> 
			
			"I think he was just having a bad day," Leahy was quoted as  saying on CNN, which first reported the incident. "I was kind  of shocked to hear that kind of language on the floor."<p> 
			
			"That doesn't sound like language the vice president would  use but there was a frank exchange of views," said Cheney  spokesman Kevin Kellems.<p> 
			
			According to congressional aides, Leahy said hello to  Cheney following the taking of the Senate group photo on the  floor of the chamber.<p> 
			
			Cheney, who is president of the Senate, then ripped into  Leahy for the Democratic senator's criticism this week of  alleged war profiteering in Iraq by Halliburton, the oil  services company that Cheney once ran.<p> 
			
			Leahy and other Democrats have called for congressional  hearings into whether the vice president helped the firm win  lucrative contracts in Iraq after the U.S.-led war that toppled  Saddam Hussein.<p> 
			
			During their exchange, Leahy noted that Republicans had  accused Democrats of being anti-Catholic because they are  opposed to some of President Bush's anti-abortion judges, the  aides said.<p> 
			
			That's when Cheney unloaded with the "F-bomb," aides said.<p> 
			
			According to Senate rules, profanity is not permitted in  the chamber. But when the exchange occurred between Leahy and  Cheney, the Senate was not in session so there was technically  no foul.
