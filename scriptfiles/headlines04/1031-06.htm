An Environmental Protection Agency proposal to study young 
children's exposure to pesticides has sparked a flurry of internal agency 
protests, with several career officials questioning whether the survey will 
harm vulnerable infants and toddlers.
<P>The EPA announced this month that it was beginning a two-year 
investigation, partially funded by the American Chemical Council, of how 60 
children in Duval County, Fla., absorb pesticides and other household 
chemicals. The chemical industry funding initially prompted some 
environmentalists to question whether the study would be biased, and some rank-
and-file agency scientists are now questioning whether the plan will exploit 
financially strapped families.
<P>In exchange for participating for two years in the Children's 
Environmental Exposure Research Study, which involves infants and children up 
to age 3, the EPA will give each family using pesticides in their home $970, 
some children's clothing and a camcorder that parents can keep.
<P>EPA officials in states such as Georgia and Colorado sent e-mail messages 
to each other last week suggesting the study lacked safeguards to ensure that 
low-income families would not be swayed into exposing their children to 
hazardous chemicals in exchange for money and high-tech gadgetry. Pesticide 
exposure has been linked to neurological problems, lung damage and birth 
defects.
<P>Suzanne Wuerthele, the EPA's regional toxicologist in Denver, wrote to 
her colleagues on Wednesday that after reviewing the project's design, she 
feared poor families would not understand the dangers associated with 
pesticide exposure.
<P>"It is important that EPA behaves ethically, consistently, and in a way 
that engenders public health. Unless these issues are resolved, it is likely 
that all three goals will be compromised, and the agency's reputation will 
suffer," she wrote in an e-mail obtained by the Washington Post. "EPA 
researchers will not tell participants that using pesticides always entails 
some risk, and not using pesticides will reduce that risk to zero."
<P>Troy Pierce, a life scientist in the EPA's Atlanta-based pesticides 
section, wrote in a separate e-mail: "This does sound like it goes against 
everything we recommend at EPA concerning use of (pesticides) related to 
children. Paying families in Florida to have their homes routinely treated 
with pesticides is very sad when we at EPA know that (pesticide management) 
should always be used to protect children."

<P>Linda Sheldon, acting administrator for the human exposure and 
atmospheric sciences division of the EPA's Office of Research and Development, 
said the agency would educate families participating in the study and inform 
them if their children's urine showed risky levels of pesticides. She said it 
was crucial for the agency to study small children, because so little is known 
about how their bodies absorb harmful chemicals.
<P>"We are developing the scientific building blocks that will allow us to 
protect children," Sheldon said, adding that the study design was reviewed by 
five independent panels of academics, officials of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, and representatives of the Duval County Health 
Department.
<P>Families can remain in the study, even if they stop using pesticides, 
Sheldon said, as long as they were using them before the experiment started. 
It was unlikely that any family would volunteer for the study out of financial 
need, she added, because researchers will require parents to invest time in 
monitoring their children's activities and diet.
<P>"Nobody can go into this study just for that amount of money," Sheldon 
said.
<P>R. Alta Charo, a professor of bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at 
Madison's law and medical schools who co-wrote a National Academy of Sciences 
report last year on the use of pesticides for research, said EPA officials 
were struggling with how to balance the need to protect the individual child's 
interests against the goal of pursuing a broader scientific agenda. While she 
said the agency's approach was reasonable, Charo said it does raise ethical 
questions.
<P>"Where is the line between enticement and a godfather offer" that 
impoverished families would find hard to refuse? Charo said. "That is really 
troubling. We make these decisions over and over in public policy. This is one 
of those moments."
<P>Several EPA officials, all of whom asked not to be identified for fear of 
retaliation, also questioned why the agency removed the study design and its 
recruitment flyer from the EPA's Web site once some scientists started to 
complain about the project. Sheldon said the agency is rewriting how it 
portrays the research.
<P>"We removed it so we could modify it, so it would make more sense," she 
said.
