UNITED NATIONS - Fear of being linked to U.S.-backed regimes 
that lack authority has inhibited potential recruits in violence-prone Iraq 
and Afghanistan from heeding calls to join nascent or rebuilding national 
armies, say U.S. academics and political and military analysts.
<p> 

					  
					  
''The challenge of creating national armies in both countries is 
fundamentally linked to the challenge of legitimacy for the new 
(U.S.-installed) governments,'' says Margaret Karns, who lectures on 
international organisations, foreign policy and diplomacy at the University 
of Dayton in Ohio State.
<p>''Low legitimacy'' for the governments of President Hamid Karzai in 
Afghanistan and Prime Minister Iyad Allawi of Iraq ''translates into 
limited willingness of individuals to sign up for the military, knowing 
that they might become targets of groups opposed to either government,'' 
Karns told IPS.
<p>Since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Washington has been 
struggling to create a 40,000-strong military force to take over security 
in the war-torn country.
<p>But according to Brigadier General James Schwitters, who is part of the 
U.S. command responsible for training Iraq's new army, only 3,000 of the 
soldiers could be regarded as having been militarily trained, as of early 
August.
<p>''Despite over a year and billions of dollars in spending, (U.S.) Defence 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and those he appointed for the mission in Iraq 
have largely failed to reconstitute meaningful security forces and 
police,'' says Erik K Gustafson, a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War and 
director of the Washington-based <a href="http://www.epic-usa.org/" target="_new">Education for Peace in Iraq Center</a> (EPIC).
<p>Gustafson also argues that the U.S.- run Coalition Provisional Authority 
(CPA), which administered Iraq until June, failed to treat the Iraqi 
interim government as a full partner or to provide Iraqi police and army 
forces with the equipment, training, oversight and funding they need to 
operate effectively.
<p>''The legacy of that failure remains and Iraqis are paying dearly in lost 
oil revenues, crime, terrorism and other violence,'' Gustafson told IPS. 
''Given the scale of failure and loss of lives and property, Rumsfeld 
should be investigated for criminal negligence,'' he added.
<p>According to a report released by the CPA on the eve of its hasty retreat 
from Baghdad, Iraqi forces have 40 percent of the weapons, less than 
one-third of the vehicles and about 25 percent of the body armour they need 
to operate as an effective military force.
<p>''I have more hope that Iraq may succeed in spite of the United States,'' 
Karns said, because it is not only a more developed country than 
Afghanistan but it also had a strong national army long before the U.S.-led 
invasion.
<p>But the new (Iraqi) government, she said, has to stop the slide toward 
''Lebanonisation,'' which has resulted in ethnic and religious feuds.
<p>More than 500,000 people were killed in the ethnic and religious battles 
that characterised the 1975-1991 civil war in Lebanon, most of them 
Christian Maronites and Muslims.
<p>On Monday, the 'New York Times' reported that U.S. Ambassador to Iraq John 
Negroponte is urging the White House to reallocate resources from 
infrastructure building in the occupied country and into improved security 
and job opportunities for Iraqis.
<p>The U.S. Congress has appropriated about 18 billion dollars for the 
reconstruction of Iraq, of which only about 600 million have been spent so 
far, added the Times story.
<p>Negroponte wants a sizeable part of the remaining funds re-channelled to 
help pay for 45,000 new Iraqi police officers, 16,000 border patrol 
officers, 99 new border outposts and an additional 20 Iraqi National Guard 
battalions (totalling about 20,000 troops). He is also seeking money for 
training and new weapons for the army.
<p>In Afghanistan, the United States, with aid from France, has succeeded in 
training a new national army of more than 13,000 troops but that is far 
below the targeted 70,000 soldiers.
<p>Manoel de Almeida e Silva, a spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan (UNAMA), told reporters in August there is a ''significant 
expansion in the size and competence of the Afghan national police force, 
as well as the Afghan national army.''
<p>''This is very important,'' he said, ''but they are not yet there.''
<p>''They are not close to reaching their total strength but this is much 
better than what existed when this phase of Afghan history began two and 
half years ago,'' added the spokesman.
<p>Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Munir 
Akram, told the U.N. Security Council last week that the Afghan national 
army is still unable to cope with the security challenges in the country.
<p>''The army suffers from what I would call an ethnic deficit and 
imbalance,'' he said. ''Until the Afghan national army is in a position to 
provide credible security, the responsibility of providing security in 
Afghanistan rests with the international forces, in particular, the 
International Assistance Force (ISAF).''
<p>The ISAF, a multinational force consisting of about 7,300 troops from the 
European and North American nations of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO), is confined mostly to the Afghan capital of Kabul. By 
the end of September, when Italian and Spanish battalions join ISAF, total 
troop strength is expected to rise to 8,300.
<p>In both Afghanistan and Iraq, attrition rates have also been high, with 
trained soldiers deserting the military to join insurgencies in the two 
countries.
<p>''The formation of the army (in Afghanistan) is incredibly slow mainly 
because there is not much incentive to join what is perceived to be the 
weakest armed faction in the country (except when the United States decided 
to back it up with fighter planes),'' says James Ingalls, founding director 
of the Afghan Women's Mission who is also working on a book about U.S. 
policy in Afghanistan.
<p>Ingalls said Washington's tactic of ''buying'' warlords to fight the 
Taliban, then awarding them seats in the government, has entrenched their 
power. ''The lack of a countrywide ISAF deployment and the half-hearted 
attempts at disarmament have only made this dismal situation worse,'' he 
told IPS.
<p>The Taliban, a group of Islamic extremists who ruled Afghanistan during 
1996-2001, was ousted from power by U.S. forces when they invaded the 
country in December 2001. Despite the efforts of thousands of U.S. soldiers 
since then, Taliban forces have not been driven from the country and appear 
resurgent, claiming responsibility for a car bomb in the capital Kabul on 
Sunday that killed about a dozen people.
<p>Taliban forces have also warned Afghans to boycott the Oct. 9 presidential 
election.
<p>Karns said the difficulties in creating a new national army in Afghanistan 
are also linked to the fundamental lack of security and the limited number 
of U.S. and NATO troops to deal with warlords and Taliban outside Kabul.
<p>''I am not optimistic, especially about Afghanistan. We and the Europeans 
have yet to commit enough military and economic resources to Afghanistan to 
make a difference, and the situation is clearly deteriorating,'' she added.
<p>In July, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer warned that both Iraq 
and Afghanistan would surely end up as failed states if the United States 
and the international community did not work together to salvage the two 
nations. The security situation in both countries was dismal, he said.
<p>''Can we afford two failed states in pivotal regions?'' he asked. ''It's 
both undesirable and unacceptable if either Afghanistan or Iraq were to be 
lost. The international community can't afford to see those countries going 
up in flames. There would be enormous repercussions for stability, and not 
only in those regions.''
