<p>WASHINGTON - 

U.S. Supreme Court  Justice William
Rehnquist  on Thursday lashed out at Congress for not seeking
input from the judiciary before it approved a law aimed at
forcing judges to follow tougher sentencing guidelines.
<p>
 "During the last year, it seems that the traditional
interchange between the Congress and the judiciary broke down
when Congress enacted what is known as the PROTECT Act, making
some rather dramatic changes to the laws governing the federal
sentencing process," Rehnquist said in his 2003 Year-End Report
on the Federal Judiciary.
<p>
 Rehnquist, who heads a group of 27 judges that in September
called for a repeal of the law, spent much of his annual report
criticizing lawmakers for approving legislation that severely
limits the ability of judges to hand down lighter sentences
than what the federal sentencing guidelines call for.
<p>
 Though he noted that it was Congress' prerogative to
determine what to consider when approving new laws, Rehnquist
said it would have improved the legislative process to at least
ask the judiciary its views.
<p>
 Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who heads
the Judiciary Committee  in the House of Representatives, said
lawmakers had received input from federal judges as they were
considering the draft legislation.
<p>
 "This disagreement resulted from a policy dispute between
Congress and the judiciary and did not result from any
breakdown in communications between the branches or a lack of
opportunity for judges to express their thoughts on this
issue," Sensenbrenner said in a statement.
<p>
 The judiciary has been mired in a battle with Congress and
the Justice Department to keep its independence and allow
judges to retain flexibility in sentencing.
<p>
 In April, Congress adopted the law aimed at forcing judges
to follow stricter sentencing guidelines. The Justice
Department was charged with creating a plan to enforce the
rules.
<p>
 As a result, Attorney General John Ashcroft directed
federal prosecutors to report on judges who issue lighter
sentences than what is recommended by the guidelines.
<p>
 Rehnquist said he was particularly troubled by that
requirement, since it collects information on an individual
judge-by-judge basis.
<p>
 He said if Congress begins to question a judge's decisions,
it could appear to be "an unwarranted and ill-considered effort
to intimidate individual judges in the performance of their
judicial duties."</p>
