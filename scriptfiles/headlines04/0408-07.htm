BAGHDAD  - U.S.-led forces in Iraq risk being  drawn into an urban guerrilla conflict they are ill-prepared to  fight and which will probably cost many more lives, military  experts say.

More than 1,400 U.S. Marines have been sent in to quell  insurgency in Ramadi and Falluja, two large Sunni Muslim towns  west of Baghdad that have been the focal point of the  anti-occupation guerrilla war for the past year.
<p> 
			
			At the same time, British, Italian, Spanish, Polish,  Ukrainian and other forces within the U.S.-led coalition are  battling to put down a Shi'ite Muslim uprising that is  spreading through towns and cities throughout southern Iraq.<p> 
			
			The fighting in Falluja and Ramadi has been particularly  intense, with witnesses reporting U.S. troops, supported by  helicopter gunships and warplanes, moving in groups on foot to  engage masked guerrillas in street-to-street combat.<p> 
			
			Early in the operation, dubbed "Vigilant Resolve," 12  Marines were killed and 20 wounded when well-armed insurgents  launched a surprise attack on the Ramadi governor's mansion,  which was occupied by U.S. forces.<p> 
			
			It was one of the heaviest tolls the Marines had suffered  in a single day of combat since the war that toppled Saddam  Hussein was launched a year ago.<p> 
			
			"Urban warfare is the worst type of warfare any infantry  can get drawn into and it's something the Americans have wanted  to avoid since the beginning," said Phillip Mitchell, an  analyst at London's International Institute for Strategic  Studies.<p> 
			
			"It means going street to street, house to house to defeat  the enemy, and if that's going to happen then the Americans are  going to take many, many more casualties," he said.<p> 
			
			U.S. SAYS FORCES READY<p> 
			
			In the past four days of fighting, not just in Ramadi and  Falluja but in Shi'ite districts of Baghdad and the southern  towns of Nassiriya, Najaf, Kerbala, Kut, Basra and Amara, at  least 35 American and allied soldiers have been killed.<p> 
			
			Hundreds of Iraqis have also died and many more been  wounded in the most intense fighting since Saddam fell.<p> 
			
			The commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General  Ricardo Sanchez, told a news conference on Thursday the  operations in Ramadi and Falluja could go on for days or weeks.<p> 
			
			"We knew before we started this campaign that that was a  possibility, and the entire military and the U.S. Marines are  prepared to engage in this type of operation," he said.<p> 
			
			But some experts say the military is trained more for heavy  combat operations using overwhelming force, not the intense cut  and thrust of house-to-house combat, and may be underestimating  the resolve of insurgents who have kept the 125,000 U.S. troops  deployed in Iraq on edge and guessing for more than a year.<p> 
			
			There are also concerns that unrestrained firing from edgy  soldiers unable to distinguish friend from foe could have  serious consequences may only incite more hatred and drive more  people to take up arms.<p> 
			
			"Neither in terms of doctrine nor training are the  Americans likely to be very good at dealing with an urban  insurgency," said William Hopkinson, a military specialist and  associate fellow at Britain's Royal United Services Institute.<p> 
			
			"The sort of fighting they're engaging in is likely to draw  more fighters into the insurgency," Hopkinson said.<p> 
			
			"The American forces' lack of feeling about the Iraq  situation could show up to very bad effect if they are further  drawn into an urban conflict."<p> 
			
			Hopkinson also worries about the ramifications of the  spreading Shi'ite uprising in the south.<p> 
			
			Militants loyal to a radical, anti-American cleric have  taken control of the holy city of Najaf, nearby Kufa and the  city of Kut to the east, where Ukrainian troops have withdrawn  from the town center.<p> 
			
			Italian troops fought pitched street battles for several  hours earlier this week to regain control of Nassiriya.
			<p> 
			
			At some point, Najaf, Kufa and Kut will have to be retaken,  meaning heavy fighting. Sanchez said coalition forces were  already being redeployed around Iraq to prepare for battle, and  promised that the cleric's militia would be destroyed.
