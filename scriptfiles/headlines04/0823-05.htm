<p>The applause started at 7:40 p.m., when she was first introduced to 
the overflow crowd at the San Francisco Hilton. By the time Arundhati Roy 
finished an hour later  --  by the time this novelist-activist-public 
intellectual completed her speech titled "Public Power in the Age of Empire"  -
-  the audience had given her two standing ovations, 20 more rounds of 
applause and countless variations of more personal salutations like, "That's 
right!" 
<P>Roy says she doesn't want to be "iconized" by the public, but it's 
happening anyway. After readings and speeches, she's mobbed by people seeking 
her handshake, her signature in a book or a photograph to prove they got close 
to this firebrand from India. Firebrand may be an understatement. Last Monday 
at the Hilton, where she addressed the American Sociological Association, Roy 
generated some of her biggest responses when she urged the United States to 
immediately pull its troops from Iraq and "pay reparations" to Iraqis, 
criticized John Kerry and other Democrats ("How dare the Democrats not be anti-war!") and described President Bush's Cabinet as "thugs."

Two days later, at a KPFA fund-raiser in Berkeley, Roy energized the sold-
out crowd within minutes of taking the stage by saying, "We have to strategize 
and take our struggle forward."
<P>It's been seven years since Roy burst onto the international literary 
scene with "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060977493/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The God of Small Things</a></i>," her semiautobiographical novel about a 
hard-luck family in southern India. Roy could have been content to stay within 
the confines of fiction  --  and some critics say she should have  --  but she 
was too restless for that. Her first big project: fighting dam building in 
India. Roy's celebrity helped generate media coverage of India's anti-dam 
movement, which objects to the way New Delhi's water projects have displaced 
millions of poor people. Roy has also opposed India's nuclear weapons 
capabilities and its embrace of capitalism  --  issues that connected her with 
international human rights groups such as the World Social Forum. 
<P>Roy's name is now synonymous with other well-known activists and liberal 
figures, including Noam Chomsky (who calls Roy "a wonder"), Howard Zinn 
(another big fan) and Michael Moore. In fact, Roy has essentially given up her 
love of fiction for a full-time career as a social critic. She still writes 
prodigiously, but every one of her new books  --  such as the just-released 
"<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0896087271/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">An Ordinary Person's Guide to Empire</a></i>"  --  is a critique of current affairs. 
It's hard to find another writer who made such a big splash with a first novel 
("<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060977493/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The God of Small Things</a></i>" commanded a $1 million advance, won the Booker 
Prize and has been translated into more than 30 languages), then veered so 
quickly into activist nonfiction, but Roy's background gives clues to her 
transition.
<P>Raised in Kerala, an Indian state whose electorate supported the 
Communist Party for many years, Roy is the daughter of a woman who 
successfully challenged India's inheritance law as it applied to Kerala's 
Christians. Under the old law, a daughter could claim only one-fourth of what 
a son could claim; Mary Roy's case was a landmark ruling in India that showed 
the younger Roy that activism could be a central mission. Even before writing 
"The God of Small Things," Roy wrote a series of essays called "The Great 
Indian Rape Trick," which criticized filmmaker Shekhar Kapur and "The Bandit 
Queen" for the way she says the drama exploited the life of Phoolan Devi. Devi 
was a lower-caste woman who, after being sexually attacked, led a group of men 
on robberies and at least one revenge killing. Roy argued that Kapur should 
have gotten Devi's permission to depict her rape on camera. Roy even helped 
convince India's courts that the movie's filmmakers erred.
<P>"I'm someone who has a very political way of looking at things," says Roy,
sitting on the steps of Union Square for a brief interview. 
<P>In person, Roy is soft-spoken and nothing like a rabble-rouser. She seems 
to save her sharpest words for the printed page. For her public speeches in 
the United States, Roy usually reads essays she has written. In fact, Roy says,
her onstage comments are really written for herself. That many people 
(especially liberal thinkers) agree with her statements is but a kind of bonus.
<P>"I think what probably drives me as a writer is a curiosity to understand 
and to keep understanding," Roy says. "When I write, I write for myself, not 
just in order to let people know, because the writing clarifies things to me." 
<P>Roy, who saw Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" during her Bay Area visit ("It was 
fantastic"), is one of many people outside the country who've taken an active 
interest in the November presidential election. Though she wants to see U.S. 
voters oust  Bush from office, Roy doesn't believe that  Kerry and the 
Democrats offer a viable alternative to Republicans. She says Bush's 
conservative agenda will continue even if Kerry wins. Roy says the same thing 
happened in India, where in May voters turned away the ruling Bharatiya Janata 
Party in favor of the Congress Party.
<P>"I personally don't think that public power today is about voting in an 
election," Roy says. "If you look at the Hindu nationalists and the Congress 
Party, the BJP is out of power  --  but they set the agenda already in the 
country. And the debate and the discussion and everything have been shifted to 
the right. What you get is a situation in which we don't really have choice. 
It's an apparent choice. I'm not an expert on the U.S. elections, but I know 
this much: Kerry has said that, even if there were no weapons of mass 
destruction (in Iraq), he would have still supported the war, and that he 
intends to send 40,000 more troops, and that he hopes to get U.N. consensus. 
(This way), they'll get Indians and Pakistanis to die there instead of 
Americans, and the French and Russians and Germans will share a little more 
than just what Halliburton and Bechtel have. As a person who belongs to a 
'subject nation,' I don't know if that's supposed to make me more happy."

Regardless of what happens in November, Roy says that progress shouldn't 
be measured in terms of "wins and losses." Citing her work in India, Roy says 
that dam building is continuing on a large scale in the country, but the anti-
dam movement has succeeded in stopping smaller projects and has persuaded some 
international investors to withdraw their support for the dams. 
<P>"The philosophy that I believe in is, I'm not doing something in order to 
win," she says. "I know people who go out to do their stuff every day knowing 
that the chances of anything happening are not very high. But if you're 
involved in something on a real basis, as opposed to just conceptually  --  if 
you look at the anti-dam movement, sure the dams are getting built, but 
there's a whole different attitude of people involved in the struggle. It's 
not that the police can go in there (anymore and crack down illegally). Those 
are huge victories  --  in a way, bigger victories than stopping the dam. 
India is a bullying society in many ways. And to just see people stand up to 
the police is such an amazing thing. Just to see that is a huge victory. . . . 
Ten years ago, big dams were like secular temples in people's heads. But now 
the faith has been broken. And people know the government is building these 
dams and violating the rights of people and doing it anyway. Even saying (my 
activism) was a complete failure  --  I'd rather be doing this. That's the 
kind of person I am." 
<P>Roy says that she might one day write another novel but that "I never 
think in advance. I never have plans. I still don't. The truth is that fiction 
is my big love. But often you're in a situation where it's very hard, 
especially because I live in India, not to intervene immediately when someone 
is shot or police have opened fire. In India, we have all these anti-terrorism 
laws, with thousands of people being picked up. We have the highest number of 
custodial deaths in the world. And still, India retains its reputation as some 
kind of spiritual destination and a real democracy, which it is not, by any 
means. My life is a bit out of my control right now. My plans keep getting 
ambushed by the real world."
<P>Roy laughs at her comment. Though it's difficult to tell this from her 
nonfiction, she has a keen sense of humor. During her two Bay Area talks, Roy, 
44, often had her audience laughing. She has a magnetic presence, which leads 
to steady attention from the media, but she's cautious of it  --  especially 
"corporate media," which she says focuses on superficial issues. (An example, 
perhaps: In 1998, People magazine named Roy, who is striking, one of the 
world's "50 most beautiful people.") Though some of Roy's critics say she is a 
grandstander, Roy is comfortable with who she has become, and how far she has 
come. At 16, she left home and lived in a squatter's camp in New Delhi before 
turning to architecture as an academic pursuit. To earn a living, she taught 
aerobics for a few years. Eventually, she found her mark as a writer with a 
strong voice.
<P>Says Roy: "I wouldn't feel I was doing anything right if everyone stood 
up and applauded."</p>
