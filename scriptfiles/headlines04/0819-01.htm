<p>WASHINGTON - Newly obtained military records of one of Sen. John Kerry's most 
vocal critics, who has accused the Democratic presidential candidate of lying 
about his wartime record to win medals, contradict his own version of events.
<P>In newspaper interviews and a best-selling book, Larry Thurlow, who 
commanded a Navy swift boat alongside Kerry in Vietnam, has strongly disputed 
Kerry's claim that his boat came under fire during a mission on March 13, 1969.
Kerry won a Bronze Star for his actions that day.
<P>But Thurlow's military records, portions of which were released Wednesday 
to the Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act, contain several 
references to "enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire" directed at the 
five-boat flotilla.
<P>Thurlow won his own Bronze Star that day, and the citation praises him 
for providing assistance to a damaged swift boat "despite enemy bullets flying 
about him."
<P>As one of five swift boat skippers who led the raid up the Bay Hap River, 
Thurlow was a direct participant in the disputed events. He is also a leading 
member of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a public advocacy group of Vietnam 
veterans that has aired a controversial television advertisement attacking 
Kerry's war record.
<P>In interviews and written reminiscences, Kerry has described how his 50-
foot patrol boat came under fire from the banks of the Bay Hap after a mine 
explosion disabled another U.S. patrol boat. According to Kerry and members of 
his crew, the firing continued as an injured Kerry leaned over the bow of his 
ship to rescue a Special Forces officer who was blown overboard in a second 
explosion.
<P>Last month, Thurlow swore in an affidavit that Kerry was "not under fire" 
when he fished Lt. James Rassmann out of the water. He described Kerry's 
Bronze Star citation, which says that all units involved came under "small 
arms and automatic weapons fire," as "totally fabricated."
<P>"I never heard a shot," Thurlow said in his affidavit, which was released by Swift Boats Veterans for Truth.
<P>A document recommending Thurlow for the Bronze Star noted that all his 
actions "took place under constant enemy small arms fire which LTJG THURLOW 
completely ignored in providing immediate assistance" to the disabled boat and 
its crew. The citation states that all other units in the flotilla also came 
under fire.
<P>Thurlow told the Post that he had received the award for helping to 
rescue the boat that was mined. "This casts doubt on anybody's awards," he 
said Wednesday night. "It is sickening and disgusting."
<P>Two other swift boat skippers who were direct participants in the March 
13, 1969, mine explosion on the Bay Hap, Jack Chenoweth and Richard Pees, have 
said they do not remember coming under "enemy fire." A fourth commander, Don 
Droz, was killed a month later.
<P>The incident featured prominently in an anti-Kerry television ad produced 
by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth earlier this month. The Bronze Star 
controversy is also a major focus of an anti-Kerry book by John E. O'Neill, 
"Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry."<p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2004 San Francisco Chronicle</p>
