<p>WASHINGTON   - Seven Americans filed a class-action  lawsuit on Tuesday to challenge the U.S. government's "no-fly"  list that stops suspected terrorists from boarding planes.<p> 
			
			All seven claim they have been wrongly placed on the U.S.  Transportation Security Administration's "no-fly" list because  their names are similar or identical to names on the list. The  lawsuit demands that the government remove their names so they  can travel on planes without being interrogated and searched.<p> 
			
			The seven plaintiffs, who range from a college student to a  woman in the military to a retired minister, joined in the  lawsuit filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  and the Transportation Security Administration .<p> 
			
			"This case is about innocent people who found out that  their government considers them potential terrorists," said  Reginald Shuford of the American Civil Liberties Union, which  filed the lawsuit.<p> 
			
			The no-fly list has grown in importance after the Sept. 11,  2001 hijackings. The TSA compiles the list and distributes it  to airlines which are instructed to stop or conduct extra  searches of people whose names match the list as they could  pose a potential threat to aviation.<p> 
			
			"Individuals whom the TSA concedes are not security threats  continue to be identified on the no-fly list," the ACLU wrote  in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Seattle.<p> 
			
			"Passengers have no meaningful opportunity to clear their  names and avoid being subjected to these delays, searches and  stigma virtually every time they fly."<p> 
			
			Shuford, the lead lawyer in the case, said the lawsuit aims  to force the government to create a way to remove people from  the list once they have proven they are innocent.<p> 
			
			"The worst thing of all, beyond the stigma, is that there's  no way at all to clear one's name from the no-fly list once  you're placed on it," Shuford told a news conference.<p> 
			
			TSA spokesman Mark Hatfield agreed that the system needed  to be changed to better respect privacy and provide a way to  get peoples' names off the list.<p> 
			
			The TSA is creating a new system, which is opposed by  advocacy groups which say it violates privacy, to replace the  no-fly list.<p> 
			
			David Fathi, a plaintiff in the suit, said he has been  stopped at airports several times since 2003. He said airline  officials said his name matches one on the no-fly list.<p> 
			
			Fathi, a lawyer who works for the ACLU, said he had  appealed to the TSA to get his name off the list.<p> 
			
			"Even after obtaining a letter of clearance from the  Transportation Security Administration I am still subject to  enhanced searches, interrogations and detention, all due to the  no-fly list," Fathi said.<p> 
			
			"I am not a hijacker. I am not a terrorist. The government  has no reason to put my name on a list of suspected  terrorists."<p> 
			
			The lawsuit claims the list violates constitutional rights  of due process and against unreasonable search and seizure.<p align="center">
