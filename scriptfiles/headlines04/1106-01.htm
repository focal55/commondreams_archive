<p>WASHINGTON - An influential foreign-policy neo-conservative 
with long-standing ties to top hawks in the administration of President 
George W Bush has laid out what he calls ''a checklist of the work the 
world will demand of this president and his subordinates in a second term.''

					  
<p>
					  
					  
The list, which begins with the destruction of Fallujah in Iraq and ends 
with the development of ''appropriate strategies'' for dealing with threats 
posed by China, Russia and ''the emergence of a number of aggressively 
anti-American regimes in Latin America,'' also calls for ''regime change'' 
in Iran and North Korea.
<p>

The list's author, Frank Gaffney, the founder and president of the Center 
for Security Policy (CSP), also warns that Bush should resist any pressure 
arising from the anticipated demise of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to 
resume peace talks that could result in Israel's giving up ''defensible 
boundaries.''
<p>
While all seven steps listed by Gaffney in an article published Friday 
morning in the 'National Review Online' have long been favored by 
prominent neo-cons, the article itself, 'Worldwide Value', is the first 
comprehensive compilation to emerge since Bush's re-election Tuesday.
<p>
It is also sure to be contested, not just by Democrats who, with the 
election behind them, are poised to take a more anti-war position on Iraq, 
but by many conservative Republicans in Congress. They blame the neo-cons 
for failing to anticipate the quagmire in Iraq and worry their grander 
ambitions, like those expounded by Gaffney, will bankrupt the Treasury and 
break an already-overextended military.
<p>
Yet its importance as a road map of where neo-conservatives -- who, with 
the critical help of Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld, dominated Bush's foreign policy after the Sept. 11, 2001 
attacks on New York and the Pentagon -- want U.S. policy to go, was 
underlined by Gaffney's listing of the names of his friends in the 
administration who he said, ''helped the president imprint moral values on 
American security policy in a way and to an extent not seen since Ronald 
Reagan's first term.''
<p>
In addition to Cheney and Rumsfeld, he cited the most clearly identified -- 
and controversial -- neo-conservatives serving in the administration: 
Cheney's chief of staff, I Lewis ''Scooter'' Libby; his top Middle East 
advisors, John Hannah and David Wurmser; weapons proliferation specialist 
Robert Joseph and top Mideast aide Elliott Abrams, on the National Security 
Council (NSC).
<p>
Also on the roster are: Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; 
Undersecretary for Policy Douglas Feith; Feith's top Mideast aide William 
Luti, in the Pentagon; Undersecretary for Arms Control and International 
Security John Bolton, and for global issues, Paula Dobriansky at the State 
Department.
<p>
Virtually all of the same individuals have been cited by critics of the 
Iraq War, including Democratic lawmakers and retired senior foreign service 
and military officials, as responsible for hijacking the policy and 
intelligence process that led to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003.
<p>
Indeed, in a lengthy interview about the war on the most-watched 
public-affairs TV program, '60 Minutes', last May, the former head of the 
U.S. Central Command and Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief Middle 
East envoy until 2003, retired Gen. Anthony Zinni, called for the 
resignation of Libby, Abrams, Wolfowitz and Feith, as well as Rumsfeld, for 
their roles in the attack.
<p>
Zinni also cited former Defense Policy Board (DPB) chairman, Richard Perle, 
who has been close to Gaffney since both of them served, along with Abrams, 
in the office of Washington State Senator Henry M Jackson in the early 1970s.

<p>
When Perle became an assistant secretary of defense under Reagan he brought 
Gaffney along as his deputy. When Perle left in 1987, Gaffney succeeded him 
before setting up CSP in 1989.
<p>
As Perle's long-time prot&eacute;g&eacute; and associate, Gaffney sits at the center of a 
network of interlocking think tanks, foundations, lobby groups, arms 
manufacturers and individuals that constitute the coalition of 
neo-conservatives, aggressive nationalists like Cheney and Rumsfeld and 
Christian Right activists responsible for the unilateralist trajectory of 
U.S. foreign policy since 9/11.
<p>
Included among CSP's board of advisers over the years have been Rumsfeld, 
Perle, Feith, Christian moralist William Bennett, Abrams, Feith, Joseph, 
former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, former Navy 
Undersecretary John Lehman and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
Director James Woolsey.
<p>
Woolsey also co-chairs the new Committee on the Present Danger (CPD), 
another prominent neo-con-led lobby group that argues Washington is now 
engaged in ''World War IV'' against ''Islamo-fascism.''
<p>
Also serving on its advisory council are executives from some of the 
country's largest military contractors, which -- along with wealthy 
individuals sympathetic to Israel's governing Likud Party, such as 
prominent New York investor Lawrence Kadish and California casino king 
Irving Moskowitz, and right-wing bodies, such as the Bradley, Sarah Scaife 
and Olin Foundations -- finance CSP's work.
<p>
Gaffney, a ubiquitous ''talking head'' on TV in the run-up to the war in 
Iraq, sits on the boards of CPD's parent organisations, the Foundation for 
the Defense of Democracies (FDD) and Americans for Victory Over Terrorism 
(AVOT). He was a charter associate, with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Perle, Wolfowitz 
and Abrams, of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), another 
prominent neo-conservative-led group that offered up a similar checklist of 
what Bush should do in the ''war on terrorism'' just nine days after the 
9/11 attacks.
<p>
His article opens by trying to pre-empt an argument that is already being 
heard on the right against expanding Bush's ''war on terrorism'': that 
since a plurality of Bush voters identified ''moral values'' as their chief 
concern, the president should stick to his social conservative agenda 
rather than expand the war.
<p>
''The reality is that the same moral principles that underpinned the Bush 
appeal on 'values' issues like gay marriage, stem-cell research and the 
right to life were central to his vision of U.S. war aims and foreign 
policy,'' according to Gaffney.
<p>

''Indeed, the president laid claim squarely to the ultimate moral value -- 
freedom -- as the cornerstone of his strategy for defeating our 
Islamofascist enemies and their state sponsors, for whom that concept is 
utterly (sic) anathema.''
<p>
To be true to that commitment, policy in the second administration must be 
directed toward seven priorities, according to Gaffney, beginning with the 
''reduction in detail of Fallujah and other safe havens utilized by 
freedom's enemies in Iraq''; followed by ''regime change -- one way or 
another -- in Iran and North Korea, the only hope for preventing these 
remaining 'Axis of Evil' states from fully realizing their terrorist and 
nuclear ambitions.''
<p>
Third, the administration must provide ''the substantially increased 
resources needed to re-equip a transforming military and rebuild 
human-intelligence capabilities (minus, if at all possible, the sorts of 
intelligence 'reforms' contemplated pre-election that would make matters 
worse on this and other scores) while we fight World War IV, followed by 
enhancing ''protection of our homeland, including deploying effective 
missile defenses at sea and in space, as well as ashore.”
<p>
Fifth, Washington must keep ''faith with Israel, whose destruction remains 
a priority for the same people who want to destroy us (and ... for our 
shared 'moral values) especially in the face of Yasser Arafat's demise and 
the inevitable, post-election pressure to 'solve' the Middle East problem 
by forcing the Israelis to abandon defensible boundaries.''
<p>
Sixth, the administration must deal with France and Germany and the dynamic 
that made them ''so problematic in the first term: namely, their 
willingness to make common cause with our enemies for profit and their 
desire to employ a united Europe and its new constitution -- as well as 
other international institutions and mechanisms -- to thwart the expansion 
and application of American power where deemed necessary by Washington.''
<p>
Finally, writes Gaffney, Bush must adapt ''appropriate strategies for 
contending with China's increasingly fascistic trade and military policies, 
(Russian President) Vladimir Putin's accelerating authoritarianism at home 
and aggressiveness toward the former Soviet republics, the worldwide spread 
of Islamofascism, and the emergence of a number of aggressively 
anti-American regimes in Latin America'', which he does not identify.
<p>
''These items do not represent some sort of neo-con 'imperialist' game 
plan'', Gaffney stressed. ''Rather, they constitute a checklist of the work 
the world will demand of this president and his subordinates in a second 
term.''
