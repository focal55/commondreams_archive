<p>JOHNSTON, Iowa - They've disagreed over taxes, trade and terrorism. And on Sunday, Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination kicked off their election-year contest with a debate over geography.

This is why I am running for president. What has happened to so many Democrats in Congress is that they've been co- opted by the agenda of George Bush, who came into office with 500,000 fewer votes than Al Gore. And what we need is a Democrat who's going to stand up to George Bush.</div>

<!--/endimage/-->Their point of contention: Washington, D.C. The gist of their dispute: whether the party should entrust its future to an experienced inside-the-beltway player like Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri or an outsider like former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont.
<p>	The debate kicked off a 15-day stretch of campaigning before Iowa Democrats cast the first votes for a presidential nominee. Polls show Dean with a narrow lead over Gephardt in Iowa, and a larger lead over Kerry in New Hampshire, which votes eight days after Iowa.
<p>	Dean used the debate, the first of three in Iowa over the next week, to bolster his standing as fresh voice eager to take on not just President Bush but also the Washington-based Democratic Party he accused of being too accommodating.
<p>	Using a question about education reform as a springboard, Dean called the No Child Left Behind Act an "unbelievable, intrusive mandate" on local schools and lambasted Congressional Democrats for supporting it.
<p>	"This is a bill that ought never to have been passed," Dean said. "This is why I am running for president. What has happened to so many Democrats in Congress is that they've been co- opted by the agenda of George Bush, who came into office with 500,000 fewer votes than Al Gore. And what we need is a Democrat who's going to stand up to George Bush."
<p>	Gephardt, who was the Democratic leader in the U.S. House until stepping down to run for president, reacted by linking his Washington experience to those of popular Democrats such as Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and former President Bill Clinton.
<p>	"He kind of runs against all of us in Washington and says that we haven't done anything. I guess I've got a question for him. Is he saying that Tom Harkin has never done anything good, or Ted Kennedy, or Bill Clinton?"
<p>	Gephardt noted that the Congressional Democrats stopped the Bush administration from enacting measures that he said would have allowed more arsenic in drinking water, privatized Social Security, allowed tax money to finance vouchers for private schools and cut off unemployment benefits to laid off workers.
<p>	"I'm proud of what we've done to fight back against the Bush administration," he said.
<p>	Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina also cast himself as an outsider who has tried to reform Washington, particularly the role of money and interest groups in politics. Saying the people of Iowa "want to see Washington changed," Edwards asked Gephardt what he would do to change the culture of a place where he has been "a long time."
<p>	Again refusing to apologize for his long tenure in Congress, Gephardt said his experience helped him get things done. "I have worked my entire career in politics to lessen the power of special interests," he said. "I got campaign reform passed in the House."
<p>	Kerry also defended Washington, pointing out that the sponsor of school reform was Kennedy, a champion of public education and a respected authority who thought the Bush administration would administer the law differently.
<p>	"It's easy to bash Washington. It's easy to bash somebody who voted for something you don't like," said Kerry.  "But there's nothing in the No Child Left Behind Act that requires it to be implemented the way this administration is doing it."
<p>	Kerry later lashed out at Dean for changing positions or statements on such things as whether Osama bin Laden should be punished or whether to release his gubernatorial records. 
<p>	"These changes … raises a serious question about your ability to be able to stand up to George Bush and make Americans feel safe and secure," Kerry said.
<p>	"There's been a lot of talk about this from the Washington politicians," said Dean. "A gaffe in Washington is when you tell the truth and the Washington establishment thinks you shouldn't have."
<p>	The debate over Washington status is noteworthy because the Democratic Party tends to nominate newcomers such as Jimmy Carter in 1976, Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992. Its two recent exceptions were two vice presidents, Walter Mondale and Al Gore.
<p>	Also Sunday, Dean denied that his campaign is based on anger, sidestepping a suggestion that he often appears angrier with President Bush than with terrorists.
<p>	"The interesting thing about my campaign is it's really based on hope, not anger," Dean said. "Our campaign empowers ordinary people, many of whom have not been in politics for years, to get involved."
<p>	He noted that one quarter of the contributors to his campaign last summer were younger than 30 and presumably new to politics. "The only way we can beat George Bush is to have a campaign based on addition, not subtraction."
<p>	Dean also moved to counter the comments he made recently that suggested his followers would not support any other Democrat for president. Should he lose the nomination, Dean said he would "vigorously" support the nominee and urge his followers to do the same. They agreed as well.
<p>	Also participating in the debate were Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois. Two candidates, retired Gen. Wesley Clark of Arkansas and the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York, did not attend.
