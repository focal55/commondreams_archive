<p> RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - Brazil said on Saturday
that it would continue fingerprinting and photographing U.S.
visitors for at least 30 days in retaliation for new U.S.
anti-terrorism controls.
<p>
 The foreign ministry said in a statement that the
government has approved a measure, to be published on Monday,
that will keep the security system in place while a government
panel reviews immigration rules.
 
<p>
 The Brazilian  move comes three days before Brazilian
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and President Bush&nbsp; were to
discuss the issue at a regional meeting in Mexico.
 <p>
 "We respect and understand the United States' security
problems, but we must find a solution that also respects the
dignified treatment of citizens from all countries," Brazil's
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim told reporters before meeting
President Lula in Brasilia.
 <p>
 The United States on Jan. 5 started fingerprinting and
photographing visitors including Brazilians who need visas to
enter the country. It exempts citizens of 27 mainly European
nations who do not need visas for short trips.
 <p>
 In retaliation, a Brazilian federal judge ordered that
starting Jan. 1, U.S. visitors to Brazil must be fingerprinted
and photographed, initially resulting in long lines. The
Brazilian government will not appeal the judge's order.
 
<p>
 On Wednesday Secretary of State Colin Powell said that the
Brazilian measures were discriminatory.
 <p>
 "We are doing it for all individuals coming into the United
States, whereas in this one case in Brazil a judge singled out
Americans," Powell told reporters before talks with Amorim.
 <p>
 Brazil's center-left government is cautious about spoiling
a good relationship with the United States, but Lula does not
want to be seen backing down on an issue that has huge popular
support.
