<p>&nbsp;ATHENS (Reuters) - The U.S. Olympic Committee has asked the  campaign to re-elect President Bush to pull an ad that refers  to the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee said  on Thursday.
<P>
The ad has angered Olympic officials because they feel it  hijacks the Olympic brand -- a registered trademark -- even  though it does not display the Games logo.
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee had asked the Bush election  "campaign to withdraw the advertisement they are running,"  International Olympic Committee spokeswoman Giselle Davies told  reporters.
<P>
The television advertisement, ahead of the presidential  elections in November, does not feature the five Olympic rings  -- one of the world's most recognizable images -- but an  announcer tells viewers that at "this Olympics there will be  two more free nations," referring to the U.S.-led invasions of  Afghanistan and Iraq under Bush's presidency.
<P>
Afghanistan returned to this year's Games after its Olympic  Committee, controlled by the then ruling hard-line Taliban  regime, was suspended in 1999 and missed the 2000 Sydney Games.
<P>
The IOC reinstated Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein.
<P>
The IOC said no official request had been made for the use  of the reference to the Games.
<P>
"We own the rights to the Olympic name and nobody asked  us," Gerhard Heiberg, head of the International Olympic  Committee's Marketing Commission had said on Wednesday.
