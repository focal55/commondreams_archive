<p>ST. LOUIS - Democratic candidate John Kerry on  Friday said President Bush's failure to fight for a renewal of  a ban on assault weapons will make it easier for terrorists to  get the lethal weapons.<p> 
			
			Campaigning in Missouri, where he trails Bush in opinion  polls less than two months before the Nov. 2 election, Kerry  said as a hunter and outdoorsman he vowed he would never try to  change the Second Amendment to the Constitution giving  Americans the right to bear arms.<p> 
			
			Under a 10-year ban enacted in 1994, weapons such as  AK-47s, TEC-9s, and Uzis were outlawed, as were high capacity  ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds. That law  expires on Monday and Congress does not plan to extend it.<p> 
			
			Kerry rebuked Bush and others for "talking about the war on  terror, trying to scare Americans." Vice President Dick Cheney  said this week that if the Democrat were elected the United  States could be hit by another attack like the on one Sept. 11,  2001.<p> 
			
			"It's real, we've got a war," Kerry said. "But we should do  more than just talk about it and try to scare people about it  and make it a political issue."<p> 
			
			Citing the 9/11 commission and other reports, Kerry said  that al Qaeda, blamed for the attacks on America three years  ago, had issued a manual that urged followers to "come to  America and buy assault weapons."<p> 
			
			"Why is George Bush making the job of terrorists easier and  making the job for America's police officers harder?" he asked  in a separate written statement.<p> 
			
			The Massachusetts senator told a town hall meeting in St.  Louis: "You can't fight a war on terror and you can't make our  streets safe ... (by) selling assault weapons in the streets of  America.<p> 
			
			"But George Bush who says 'Oh, I'm for that' never asked  the Congress to pass it, never pushed the Congress to pass it,  never stood up, caves into the NRA (National Rifle  Association), gives into the special interests and America's  streets will not be as safe because of the choice George Bush  is making."<p> 
			
			TRIES APPEAL TO GUNOWNERS<p> 
			
			Kerry, a New England blueblood who served 20 years in the  Senate after two decorated tours in the Vietnam War, has tried  to appeal to the more conservative voters in important  battleground states by presenting himself as a lifelong  outdoorsman.<p> 
			
			In the past week, he has been photographed trap shooting in  Ohio and holding a gun given to him by a supporter at a rally  in Racine, West Virginia.<p> 
			
			"I mean, heavens to Betsy folks, we've had that law on the  books for the last 10 years and there's not a gun owner in  America who can stand up and say they tried to take my guns  away," Kerry said. "I mean, let's get real. Let's get real."<p> 
			
			He told several hundred supporters of his pheasant hunting  trip in Iowa earlier this year when he was trailing in the race  for the Democratic presidential nomination.<p> 
			
			"I am a hunter and I'm a gun owner and I have hunted since  I was about a teenager and I respect it ... and I believe in  the Second Amendment," he said. "And I'll tell you this, as a  hunter, I've never ever thought about going hunting with an  AK-47 or an Uzi or anything else. Never."<p> 
			
			Bush has said he would sign an extension of the assault  weapons ban but he did not press for its renewal by the  Congress. The politically powerful National Rifle Association  gun lobby has made killing it a top priority, and some  lawmakers are fearful of crossing the NRA weeks before  congressional elections. Polls show a majority of Americans  support renewing the ban.<p> 
			
			The NRA has not yet formally endorsed Bush's re-election  bid. A Kerry aide said the senator had never been a member of  the NRA because he did not agree with its policies.
