<p>MADRID  - Spain's next prime minister spurned the  U.S. president's appeal for unity Wednesday and branded the  Iraq occupation a fiasco as a probe into the Madrid bombings  that killed 201 people entered a "decisive phase."

Socialist Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who ousted Prime  Minister Jose Maria Aznar in a shock election victory at the  weekend, stood his ground on withdrawing Spanish troops from  Iraq despite a plea from President Bush.<p> 
			
			"I will listen to Mr. Bush but my position is very clear  and very firm," Zapatero told Spain's Onda Cero radio. "The  occupation is a fiasco."<p> 
			
			Bush urged Spain and other allies in Iraq Tuesday not to  cave in to pressure from the Muslim militant al Qaeda group by  withdrawing their troops.<p> 
			
			Spanish police focused on a Moroccan link in their  investigation into last week's bombings of four trains in  Madrid -- Western Europe's worst guerrilla attack -- in which  201 people were killed and 1,750 injured.<p> 
			
			Interior Minister Angel Acebes, a member of the outgoing  government, gave few fresh details about the inquiry, citing a  judge's gagging order, but said: "It is a decisive phase."<p> 
			
			"International connections" were one area police were  working on, Acebes told a news conference.<p> 
			
			As Spain stepped up security at airports and strategic  installations around the country, Zapatero pledged a sweeping  security shakeup and to stamp on any violent group, including  Basque separatist guerrillas ETA.<p> 
			
			"I am planning...to finish off terrorism," he said.<p> 
			
			But Zapatero, who takes office next month, ignored Bush's  plea, reiterating his election campaign pledge to withdraw  Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq if the United Nations did not  take charge there by mid-year.<p> 
			
			The comments have raised concern among some U.S. allies who  are unclear exactly what U.N. role he wants to see in Iraq.<p> 
			
			In Madrid, thousands of Aznar supporters protested,  accusing the Socialists of "exploiting" the bombings to win  votes.<p> 
			
			Aznar's Popular party drew anger ahead of the ballot for  hastily blaming ETA. Then as suspicions of al Qaeda involvement  grew, the party suffered from perceptions it bore  responsibility for sending troops to Iraq despite huge public  opposition.<p> 
			
			MOROCCO LINK<p> 
			
			Spanish police arrested five people after the blasts on  Thursday, including three Moroccans. Police are hunting for  some 20 Moroccans, who may also be linked to last May's  Casablanca attack in which 45 people died, including 12 suicide  bombers.<p> 
			
			El Pais newspaper said police believed the Madrid attacks  were carried out by people linked to the Moroccan Islamic  Combatant Group, which it said is financed by al Qaeda.<p> 
			
			Police sources told Reuters Morocco has given Madrid a list  of suspects believed linked to the Casablanca bombings who may  be in Spain. The list led to the arrests of three Casablanca  suspects before the train bombings.<p> 
			
			"We're looking for people on the list, but not just them,"  a police source said. "The radical Islamic world is very  complex and we don't know if any of those (suspected in  Casablanca) may have links to other groups."<p> 
			
			Police were analyzing documents seized Tuesday night in the  Madrid district of Lavapies, state radio reported.<p> 
			
			It said police continued to interrogate one of those  arrested, Jamal Zougam, trying to establish if he had links to  Islamist groups responsible for the Casablanca attacks.<p> 
			
			A judge Wednesday ordered an Algerian man to be held in  jail for two more days to see if his threats in January to  "kill a load of Madrid people" were linked to the train  bombings.<p> 
			
			The man, identified as Ali Amrous, was arrested Monday in  the Basque city San Sebastian. Court sources have said it was  unlikely Amrous had a role in the attack, but investigators  wanted to speak to other foreign nationals who were with him in  San Sebastian in January.<p> 
			
			La Vanguardia newspaper said the Madrid bombers spent 15 to  20 days studying train timetables and the stations. It said two  groups of three bombers each placed the explosives that ripped  apart four commuter trains.
