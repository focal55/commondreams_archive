In May 1970, after four young people were shot dead at an anti-Vietnam protest at Kent State University, a group of students in Tempe pulled the American flag in the middle of the Arizona State University campus down to half-staff in a sign of solidarity against the war.<br>
<br>

One of those students, Edward "Jack" Lowell, is still living in Tempe 34 years later, and is still against war.<br>
<br>

Lowell, now a geologist and gem cutter, found himself so enraged by what he sees as an unnecessary conflict in Iraq that he felt determined to do something. <br>
<br>

Living under the Sky Harbor International Airport flight path, Lowell saw an opportunity to spread his views.<br>
<br>

For weeks he labored obsessively, building a giant peace sign, 10 feet in diameter, on the roof of his house. Hoisted 20 feet in the air and suspended by ropes tied to his backyard trees, the peace sign is constructed from metal and covered in America Online CDs and old music CDs, shiny side up, reflecting his opinion for all overhead to see. <br>
<br>

"I was a Boy Scout so I knew that one signal mirror you can see for miles, so I said, (with) all these planes going by here, I want the world to know that I don't want this war," said Lowell, who spent 10 days affixing 250 CDs on the sign.<br>
<br>

Sky Harbor officials said they had not received any comments or complaints about the sign.<br>
<br>

With soldiers dying daily and the new allegations of torture of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, Lowell said he is disappointed that there hasn't been more protest or at least dialogue. <br>
<br>

"It's like everyone's got to be on antidepressants or something not to care," said Lowell, 55.<br>
<br>

While at ASU, Lowell had a young family and, because of a student deferment, he was not drafted into the service. At the time, he said, the campus was engulfed in the war and involvement was more commonplace. <br>
<br>

"On campus you had the Student Mobilization Committee, the Students for a Democratic Society, which were considered Commies, you had that guy Starsky who was fired for being against the war," Lowell said, referring to Professor Morris Starsky, a self-proclaimed socialist who was fired in 1970 after voicing opposition to the war. "It was like a hotbed." <br>
<br>

Lowell said he doesn't belong to any political organizations. He is currently registered as a Democrat, though he's thinking of defecting because presumed Democratic nominee John Kerry voted for the war and will likely keep large numbers of troops in Iraq if elected. <br>
<br>

"We don't even know yet the cost of the war. They're saying $25 billion more now, but what is the true cost? All these soldiers who have been maimed and amputated and are on life support coming back. That's not added in to what (Bush is) asking for from Congress," Lowell said about the money the president asked for this month.<br>
<br>

"I'm supporting our troops by saying they should come home... You can support the troops by saying 'end the war' so they don't have to go there."
