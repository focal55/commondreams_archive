<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Education Secretary Rod Paige called the nation's largest 
      teachers union a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; during a private White House 
      meeting with governors on Monday.
    <p>
      Democratic and Republican governors confirmed Paige's remarks about the 
      National Education Association.
    <p>
      &quot;These were the words, 'The NEA is a terrorist organization,'&quot; said 
      Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin.
    <p>
      &quot;He was making a joke, probably not a very good one,&quot; said Democratic 
      Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania. &quot;Of course he immediately divorced the 
      NEA from ordinary teachers, who he said he supports.&quot;
    <p>
      &quot;I don't think the NEA is a terrorist organization,&quot; said Rendell, who 
      has butted heads with the group as well. &quot;They're not a terrorist 
      organization any more than the National Business Organization is a 
      terrorist organization.
    <p>
      Neither the Education Department nor NEA had an immediate comment on 
      Paige's comments. Both indicated that statements were forthcoming.
    <p>
      Education has been a top issue for governors, who have sought more 
      flexibility from the administration on President Bush's &quot;No Child Left 
      Behind&quot; law, which seeks to improve school performance in part by 
      allowing parents to move their children from poorly performing schools.
    <p>
      Democrats have said Bush has failed to fully fund the law, giving the 
      states greater burdens but not the resources to handle them.
    <p>
      Missouri Gov. Bob Holden, a Democrat, said Paige's remarks startled the 
      governors, who met for nearly two hours with Bush and several Cabinet 
      officials.
    <p>
      &quot;He is, I guess, very concerned about anybody that questions what the 
      president is doing,&quot; Holden said.
    <p>
      &quot;He was implying that the NEA has not been one of the organizations that 
      has been working with the administration to try to solve 'No Child Left 
      Behind,'&quot; he said.
    <p>
      Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican, said of Paige's comments: 
      &quot;Somebody asked him about the NEA's role and he offered his perspective 
      on it.&quot;
    <p>
      Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, said the comments were 
      made in the context of &quot;we can't be supportive of the status quo and 
      they're the status quo. But whatever the context, it is inappropriate - 
      I know he wasn't calling teachers terrorists - but to ever suggest that 
      the organization they belong to was a terrorist organization is uncalled 
      for.&quot;
    <p>
      When Bush welcomed the governors at the State Dining Room during brief 
      public comments, he told them that rising political tensions of an 
      election year won't stop him from working closely with them.
    <p>
      &quot;I fully understand it's going to be the year of the sharp elbow and the 
      quick tongue,&quot; Bush said. &quot;But surely we can shuffle that aside 
      sometimes and focus on our people.&quot;
    <p>
      &quot;We'll continue to work hard to help you. Because by helping our 
      governors, we really help our people,&quot; he said.
    <p>
      Bush spent much of the first half of his opening comments on foreign 
      policy and the war on terrorism, defending his decision to go war in 
      Iraq and thanking the governors for their work on homeland security.
    <p>
      &quot;The most important job of anyone in public office is to protect the 
      people of our country,&quot; he said.
    <p>
      Bush also defended his domestic policies, telling the governors that he 
      strongly believed in his education law and that the tax cuts he 
      championed were helping spur the economy.
    <p>
      The governors are in Washington for four days of discussions at the 
      annual meeting of the National Governors Association, though the usual 
      effort to build consensus was marked by partisan politics that Democrats 
      said couldn't be avoided.
    <p>
      Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, 
      said he planned to confront Bush on White House predictions of 2.6 
      million new jobs this year. Bush spokesmen already have backed off those 
      numbers.
    <p>
      &quot;If the president's not going to fight for jobs, governors will, 
      Democratic governors will,&quot; Vilsack said. &quot;We're on the front line of 
      that fight every day, and we see the consequences of having lost three 
      million jobs.&quot;
