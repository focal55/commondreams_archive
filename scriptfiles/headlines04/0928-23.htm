<p>WASHINGTON  - 
The same intelligence unit that produced a gloomy report in July 
about the prospect of growing instability in Iraq warned the Bush 
administration about the potential costly consequences of an American-led 
invasion two months before the war began, government officials said Monday.
<P>The estimate came in two classified reports prepared for President Bush 
in January 2003 by the National Intelligence Council, an independent group 
that advises the director of central intelligence. The assessments predicted 
that an American-led invasion of Iraq would increase support for political 
Islam and would result in a deeply divided Iraqi society prone to violent 
internal conflict.
<P>One of the reports also warned of a possible insurgency against the new 
Iraqi government or U.S.-led forces, saying that rogue elements from Saddam 
Hussein's government could work with existing terrorist groups or act 
independently to wage guerrilla warfare, the officials said. The assessments 
also said a war would increase sympathy across the Islamic world for some 
terrorist objectives, at least in the short run, the officials said.
<P>The contents of the two assessments had not been previously disclosed. 
They were described by the officials after two weeks in which the White House 
has tried to minimize the council's latest report, which was prepared this 
summer and read by senior officials early this month.
<P>Last week, Bush dismissed the latest intelligence reports, saying its 
authors were just guessing about the future, though he corrected himself later,
calling it an estimate.
<P>The assessments, meant to address the regional implications and internal 
challenges that Iraq would face after Hussein, said it was unlikely that Iraq 
would split apart after an American invasion, the officials said. But they 
said there was a significant chance that domestic groups would engage in 
violent internal conflict with one another unless an occupying force prevented 
them from doing so.
<P>Senior White House officials, including Condoleezza Rice, the national 
security adviser, have contended that some of the early predictions provided 
to the White House by outside experts of what could go wrong in Iraq, 
including secular strife, have not come to pass. But Bush has acknowledged a 
miscalculation about the virulence of the insurgency that would rise against 
the country's American occupiers, though he insisted that was simply an 
outgrowth of the speed of the initial military victory in 2003.
<P>The officials outlined the reports after Robert Novak, in a column 
published Monday in the Washington Post, wrote that a senior intelligence 
official had told a West Coast gathering last week that the White House had 
disregarded warnings from intelligence agencies that a war would intensify 
anti-American hostility in the Muslim world. Novak identified the official as 
Paul R. Pillar, the national intelligence officer for the Near East and South 
Asia, and criticized him for making remarks that Novak said were critical of 
the administration.
<P>The National Intelligence Council is an independent group, made up of 
both outside academics and long-time intelligence professionals. Its main task 
is to produce National Intelligence Estimates, the most formal reports 
outlining the consensus of intelligence agencies. One of the intelligence 
documents described the building of democracy in Iraq as a long, difficult and 
potentially turbulent process with potential for backsliding into 
authoritarianism, the officials said.<P align="center">&copy; 2004 San Francisco Chronicle
