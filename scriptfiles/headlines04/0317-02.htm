<p>ROME &#0151; At several tense junctures since Italy dispatched troops to Iraq last year, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has emphatically stated his commitment to keeping troops there, and he did so again this week.</p>
<P>
Even as voters in Spain toppled a government that had also sent armed forces, Mr. Berlusconi vowed to stand firm. His political allies and adversaries alike say they expect him to make good on that pledge.</p>
<P>
But Italian political analysts say  the terrorist attacks in Madrid, the election upset in Spain and the proposed withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq have unequivocally put the Italian prime minister in a delicate, difficult position.</p>
<P>
Those events, they say, are sure to embolden his opponents, who are clearly trying to calculate whether the prime minister's support for America's intervention in Iraq makes him even more vulnerable than they had previously imagined.</p>
<P>
Those opponents are once again raising questions about the Italian policy, a development that partly reflects Italians' fears that this country could pay for the closeness of its alliance with the United States.</p>
<P>
As a result, analysts say, Mr. Berlusconi may find himself challenged as never before to defend the help that Italy has provided the United States in Iraq.</p>
<P>
"There is this fear of terrorism here that will maybe &#0151; I don't know yet &#0151; strengthen the party that wants to go away from Iraq, and this is a problem for Berlusconi," said Renato Mannheimer, an Italian political analyst and sociologist.</p>
<P>
"The only luck for Berlusconi is that his opponents are so divided," Mr. Mannheimer said Tuesday.</p>
<P>
That is just one of many ways in which the political situation in Italy, at least in terms of the country's involvement in Iraq, is more complicated than in Spain.</p>
<P>
Like Spain, Britain and Poland, Italy sent troops to Iraq, but only  after the fall of Baghdad.</p>
<P>
Mr. Berlusconi made a clear concession to Italian public opinion, which was overwhelmingly against the war, by not even asking the Italian Parliament to authorize a deployment of troops at the outset of the war. When he did seek such an authorization last April, it was for a limited contingent, which now stands at about 3,000 soldiers, paramilitary officers and civilians.</p>
<P>
The center-left opposition in Parliament abstained from that vote, partly reflecting the opposition's profound internal divisions over the situation. Those divisions have not disappeared.</p>
<P>
Nor have Mr. Berlusconi's opponents come to any confident conclusion about what, precisely, most Italians really want their leaders to do.</p>
<P>
After the deaths of 19 Italians in a suicide bombing in  Iraq, last November, there was no resounding public outcry to move Italians out of harm's way. But there were plenty of expressions of defiance &#0151; of not wanting to capitulate to terrorism.</p>
<P>
"It's not easy to say what's going on in the Italian mood,"  Lapo Pistelli, a center-left member of Parliament, said Tuesday.  "Within one person, you often find two moods: a sense that the risk in Italy is high and that Italy could be a target of terrorism and yet, on the other hand, a strange feeling of pride." </p>
<P>
He  also noted that the moral of the Spanish elections on Sunday was unclear. He said that the party of  Prime Minister Jos&#0233; Mar&#0237;a Aznar was perhaps being punished not for supporting the United States in Iraq but for initially blaming Basque separatists for  the terrorist attacks. </p>
