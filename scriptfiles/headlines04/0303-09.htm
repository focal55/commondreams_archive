<p>PORTLAND, Ore.  - Same-sex couples exchanged  marriage vows in Oregon on Wednesday hours after commissioners  in Multnomah County, which includes Portland, the state's  largest city, said the practice was legal.
<p> 
			
			Hundreds of gay couples, many clutching flowers and minding  children, waited in pelting rain to apply for marriage licenses  after county officials, citing an ambiguously worded state law,  matched recent rulings in several U.S. cities and towns.<p>

"We asked our (county) attorney if our current practice was  still legal. Based on her opinion, we would be violating the  Oregon constitution if we were to continue to deny same-sex  couples marriage licenses," county commissioner Serena Cruz  told a news conference.<p> 
			
			Lonnie Roberts, a conservative on the county commission who  opposes gay marriage but supports civil unions, was cut out of  the discussions and plans to challenge the ruling. "We have  several options," said Gary Walker, Robert's chief of staff  "There are already people working up law suits."<p> 
			
			Oregon's governor and attorney general did not immediately  comment on the ruling.<p> 
			
			According to Oregon law, marriage is a "civil contract  entered into in person by males at least 17 years of age and  females at least 17 years of age," which technically does not  rule out same-sex marriage, proponents say.<p> 
			
			The decision touched off a firestorm of criticism from  conservatives and Christian groups.<p> 
			
			"We do not agree with the actions taken by the four  commissioners and we will be investigating the legal procedures  we might exercise," said Nick Graham, executive director of the  conservative Oregon Family Council.<p> 
			
			Some critics showed up outside the county courthouse in  Portland to shout their disapproval. One carried a sign  reading, "God is watching you pervert."<p> 
			
			But the newly married couples, some of whom took their vows  on the court house steps, were ecstatic.<p> 
			
			Kelly Burke, who married her partner Dolores Doyle, said  they were worried about protecting the rights of their toddler  son and getting Kelly on Doyle's health insurance plan.<p> 
			
			The couple, who have been together for 15 years, "are  elated, thrilled to finally be married," Burke said.<p> 
			
			Gay marriage has become a national election-year issue in  recent weeks after the Massachusetts high court ordered gay  marriages by mid-May and more than 3,440 same-sex couples were  married in San Francisco.<p> 
			
			Two cities in New York state and a county in New Mexico  have also sanctioned same-sex marriages.<p> 
			
			Proponents said banning gay marriages violated  anti-discrimination laws by prohibiting couples from inheriting  each other's assets, jointly owning homes or providing each  other with health benefits.
