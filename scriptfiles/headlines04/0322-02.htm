<p>GAZA - Israel assassinated Hamas leader Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin outside a Gaza mosque Monday, striking its
heaviest blow against the militant group behind dozens of
suicide bombings and drawing enraged vows of revenge.
<p>
 Israeli security sources said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
personally ordered and monitored the helicopter attack against
the paralyzed cleric, whose wheelchair lay smashed in a pool of
blood after three missiles exploded.
 <p>
 It was the highest-profile assassination of a Palestinian
since the April 1988 killing in Tunis of Palestinian commando
chief Khalil al-Wazir. At least seven other people died in the
Gaza strike and two of Yassin's sons were among 15 wounded.

The attack on Yassin as he and his entourage left dawn
prayers seemed to be aimed at weakening Hamas, a group seeking
Israel's destruction, to prevent it from claiming victory
should Sharon go ahead with a planned unilateral pullout from
Gaza.
 <p>
 After the first missile hit, a witness told Reuters: "I
looked to see where Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was. He was lying on
the ground and his wheelchair was destroyed. People there
darted left and right. Then another two missiles landed."
 <p>
 Another one of Yassin's sons, Mohammed, told Reuters he had
remarked to his father about three hours before the attack
about an Israeli reconnaissance plane spotted in the sky.
 <p>
 <TT> "He said, 'We seek martyrdom....to him (God) we belong and</TT>
to him we return."'
 <p>
 Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, speaking to
reporters, called Yassin "the Palestinian (Osama) bin Laden"
and said his hands were covered in Israeli blood. Mofaz pledged
more Israeli attacks on Hamas's top echelon.
 <p>
 But a dissenting voice in the Israeli cabinet, Interior
Minister Avraham Poraz, said Yassin -- Hamas's spiritual leader
-- was not "a ticking bomb" and voiced concern his death could
lead to the loss of many more Israeli lives in suicide attacks.
 <p>
 Previous assassinations of militants have triggered waves
of suicide bombings that have turned Israeli buses, restaurants
and cafes into charred wrecks and deepened violence that has
stalled a U.S.-backed peace "road map."
 <p>
 Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians poured out their
grief in a funeral procession for Yassin and the other dead.
 <p>
 While espousing "armed struggle," Yassin's movement also
ran a broad welfare network for Palestinians and he was seen by
many in the West Bank and Gaza as a heroic symbol of resistance
to Israeli occupation.
 <p>
 "DOOR TO CHAOS"
 <p>
 Officials in the Palestinian Authority  called Yassin a
moderating force in Hamas, an Islamic movement he co-founded in
1987 with encouragement from Israel, which hoped the new group
would undercut its long-time enemy, PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
 <p>
 "It is a clear message to the world that the Israelis are
not ready to sit with the Palestinians for peace," Palestinian
Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie told reporters after the killing,
which he said "opened the door to chaos."
 <p>
 Eyes burning with tears and rage, mourners reached out to
touch Yassin's Islamic flag-draped coffin in the biggest public
turnout in Gaza since Arafat's triumphant entry in 1994 after
interim peace deals with Israel.
 <p>
 "Sharon, start preparing your body bags because (Hamas's)
Qassam Brigades will put Israeli houses in mourning and make a
funeral in every Israeli street," the crowd chanted.
<p>
 In the first sign of revenge within Israel, a Palestinian
with an axe hurt three people outside an army base near Tel
Aviv, Israeli police said. He was arrested.
<p>
In scenes reminiscent of the start of a Palestinian
uprising that began in September 2000, protests erupted in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
<p>
Witnesses said Israeli forces killed a gunman in the Gaza
Strip and an 11-year-old during a demonstration in the area.
<p>
In the West Bank city of Nablus, witnesses said soldiers
shot dead a university student-reporter during an anti-Israeli
protest. The army said he was a gunman who fired at the troops.
<p>
The Israeli army sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
stop any Palestinians entering Israel.
<p>
Mosques called an immediate general strike. Arafat, the
Palestinian president, declared three days of mourning. He and
his cabinet stood in a moment of silence at the start of an
emergency meeting.
<p>
A senior State Department official urged all sides to
remain calm. The United States brands Hamas a terrorist group.
<p>
Hamas said it believed Washington, where Sharon hopes to
win support for go-it-alone steps Palestinians fear could turn
into an Israeli land grab in the West Bank, had given the green
light for Yassin's assassination.
<p>
In Brussels, the European Union condemned what it called
Israel's "extra-judicial killing" as illegal and likely to
further inflame violence.
