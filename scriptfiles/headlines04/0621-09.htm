<p> BAGHDAD   - President Bush and Secretary of Defense  Donald Rumsfeld should take the witness stand at the trial of a  U.S. soldier charged with abusing prisoners in Iraq, the  soldier's lawyer said on Monday.<p> 
			
			Policies adopted in Bush's "war on terror" created a  climate encouraging cruelty, said lawyers for U.S. soldiers  accused of subjecting detainees to sexual humiliation and  physical abuse at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison.<p> 
			
			"No one can suggest with a straight face that the MPs  (military police) acted alone," said defense lawyer Guy Womack,  representing Specialist Charles Graner, who faces the most  serious charges of the soldiers to be court martialed.<p> 
			
			"They were directly under the supervision of military  intelligence officers," he told reporters after a pretrial  hearing.<p> 
			
			Pretrial hearings were held on Monday for Specialist  Charles Graner -- who faces the most serious charges of all the  Abu Ghraib accused -- and Sergeant Javal Davis.<p> 
			
			Davis's defense counsel Paul Bergrin said Bush and Rumsfeld  sidestepped the Geneva Convention, encouraging abuse that  stretched down the chain of command to the soldiers at Abu  Ghraib, notorious as a torture center under Saddam Hussein.<p> 
			
			He said his client -- accused of jumping on a pile of  prisoners and stomping on their feet -- was instructed on a  daily basis to soften up Iraqi prisoners to obtain  intelligence.<p> 
			
			"Bush gave a speech declaring his war on terror and said  the Geneva Convention no longer applied," he told reporters  after an impassioned address in the court room.<p> 
			
			Bergrin said he would seek to put both Bush and Rumsfeld on  the stand as witnesses.<p> 
			
			A scheduled hearing for Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick was  postponed to July 23 after his civilian defense counsel, Gary  Myers, failed to turn up in court, despite the judge's earlier  rejection of his request to represent his client by telephone  to avoid the violent chaos gripping Iraq.<p> 
			
			ABU GHRAIB "A CRIME SCENE"<p> 
			
			During Monday's hearing, the U.S. military judge handling  the case agreed to Bergrin's request to question top American  generals, testimonies the defense counsel hopes to use to show  that abuses were sanctioned from the top down.<p> 
			
			Judge Colonel James Pohl said Central Command chief General  John Abizaid and Iraq commander Lieutenant General Ricardo  Sanchez and others could be interviewed.<p> 
			
			The U.S. army, keen to demonstrate it is weeding out the  culprits, has charged seven low-ranking suspects in relation to  abuse at Abu Ghraib, which U.S. officials have blamed on a few  wayward individuals.<p> 
			
			Pohl ordered the prison be preserved as a "crime scene,"  despite an offer by Bush to tear down the building. Bergrin  said he wanted to take members of the jury to the jail so they  could experience the conditions U.S. soldiers were working  under.<p> 
			
			"We want the court members to smell the fecal matter and  the urine that service members who worked inside that prison  and who are accused in this case had to live with," he said.<p> 
			
			No date has been set for the start of any trial for the  three defendants, who have yet to plead.<p> 
			
			Graner, who faces the most serious accusations, could be  sentenced to up to 24 years and six months in jail if  convicted.<p> 
			
			He is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on  a leash, and posing for a picture by a pile of naked detainees.<p> 
			
			Graner is also charged with making prisoners strip and  masturbate in front of each other, and forcing one detainee to  simulate oral sex on another, before taking a picture.<p> 
			
			Frederick faces charges including participating in an  incident where a prisoner was hooded and made to stand on a box  with wires attached to him, and told he would be electrocuted  if he fell off -- an image splashed on front pages worldwide.<p> 
			
			One U.S. soldier, Specialist Jeremy Sivits, has already  been sentenced to a year in prison after admitting abuse  charges.
