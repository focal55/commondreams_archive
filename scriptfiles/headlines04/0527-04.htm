<p>WASHINGTON  - Nine months after Congress shut down
a controversial Pentagon  computer-surveillance program, the
U.S. government continues to comb private records to sniff out
suspicious activity, according to a congressional report
obtained by Reuters.

Privacy concerns prompted Congress to kill the Pentagon's
&#36;54 million Total Information Awareness program last September,
but government computers are still scanning a vast array of
databases for clues about criminal or terrorist activity, the
General Accounting Office  found.
<p>
 Overall, 36 of the government's 199 "data mining" efforts
collect personal information from the private sector, a move
experts say could violate civil liberties if left unchecked.
<p>
 Several appear to be patterned after Total Information
Awareness, which critics said could have led to an Orwellian
surveillance state in which citizens have little privacy.
<p>
 "I believe that Total Information Awareness is continuing
under other names, and the (Defense Department) projects listed
here might fit that bill," said Peter Swire, an Ohio State
University law professor who served as the Clinton
administration's top privacy official.
<p>
 Defense Department officials did not respond to a request
for comment.
<p>
 Data-mining software has been used by the government and
private businesses for years to make sense of large piles of
information. Banks use data-mining tools to sniff out possible
credit-card fraud, for example.
<p>
 Most government data-mining projects aim to improve service
or cut down on waste and fraud, the report said.
<p>
 The U.S. Navy  tracks each ship part ordered since 1980 to
see which ones fail most frequently, while the Department of
Education checks its student loan records against those held by
the Social Security Administration  to make sure it is not
loaning money to dead people.
<p>
 Others projects raised red flags for privacy experts.
<p>
 The Pentagon agency that handled TIA is not working on any
data-mining projects, but another agency is mining intelligence
reports and Internet searches "to identify foreign terrorists
or U.S. citizens connected to foreign terrorism activities,"
the report said.
<p>
 That description prompted <a href="http://www.epic.org/" target="_new">Electronic Privacy Information
Center</a> general counsel David Sobel to file a Freedom of
Information Act request to find out more about the project.
<p>
 "Congress now needs to take a close look at ways to oversee
and regulate the use of data-mining technology within the
government," he said.
<p>
 Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka said he had asked the
GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, to examine some
projects more closely.
<p>
 "The federal government collects and uses Americans'
personal information and shares it with other agencies to an
astonishing degree, raising serious privacy concerns," Akaka
said in a statement.
<p>
 The report shows that data mining can be a useful tool for
the government, but safeguards should be put in place to ensure
that information is not abused, said Nuala O'Connor Kelly,
chief privacy officer at the Department of Homeland Security.
<p>
 Swire said the report did not appear to list any Justice
Department  programs that use information from data aggregators
ChoicePoint Inc. and Acxiom Corp., even though the agency has
signed contracts with those companies.
<p>
 The Justice Department did not return a call seeking
comment.
<p>
The report also failed to note a planned airline
passenger-screening system that has drawn widespread criticism
from lawmakers and air travelers.
