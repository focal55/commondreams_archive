BAGHDAD  - A huge car bomb blast tore through a  crowded market close to a Baghdad police headquarters building  Tuesday, killing at least 47 people in the deadliest single  attack in the Iraqi capital in six months.
<P>
An Internet statement in the name of the Tawhid and Jihad  group led by Jordanian al Qaeda ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi  claimed responsibility for the blast, which it said was carried  out by a suicide attacker. Washington says Zarqawi is its top  enemy in Iraq and has put a $25 million price on his head.
<P>
"With the grace of God, a lion from our martyrdom brigades  was successful in striking a center for apostate police  volunteers," said the statement, which could not be verified.
<P>
The Health Ministry said 47 people were killed and 114  wounded. The Interior Ministry said at least one car bomb was  used in the attack in Haifa street, a flashpoint area notorious  as a stronghold of criminals and guerrillas.
<P>
In a separate incident in the restive town of Baquba,  northeast of Baghdad, gunmen opened fire on a police minibus.  The town's police chief said 12 people were killed. Zarqawi's  group also claimed responsibility for that attack.
<P>
Guerrillas also blew up oil pipelines in northern Iraq,  cutting northern oil exports and forcing a nearby power station  to be shut down. The attack meant large areas of Iraq were  without electricity from 3 a.m. onward.
<P>

<b>"ALL I SAW WAS BLOOD"
</b>
<P>
The Baghdad blast caused carnage in the crowded market and  streets near the police headquarters building.
<P>
"I was standing there talking to my friend when suddenly  all I saw was blood, and my friend lying dead," said an Iraqi  man who gave his name as Zafer, speaking from his hospital bed  with blood and scratches on his face and bandages on his  stomach.
<P>
Hospital workers hosed pools of blood from the floor.
<P>&nbsp;At the blast site, rescuers pulled bodies from mangled  market stalls. The area was littered with shoes, clothes and  body parts, as well as fruit and vegetables from the market.
<P>
Bloodstained corpses lay on pavements strewn with chairs,  glass and rubble from blown-out shopfronts. Dazed bystanders  vainly checked bodies for signs of life.
<P>
Smoke from blazing vehicles in the middle of the street  billowed into the sky as fire crews tried to douse the flames.  A huge crater was punched into the road. Ambulances with sirens  wailing ferried the dead and wounded to hospital as U.S.  helicopters buzzed overhead.
<P>
Sunday, guerrillas mounted multiple car bomb and mortar  attacks in central Baghdad, during a day of violence in which  more than 100 people were killed across the country.
<P>
Many of Sunday's casualties were also in Haifa Street,  where U.S. troops have repeatedly clashed with guerrillas.
<P>
Following Tuesday's bombing, U.S. troops again moved into  Haifa Street and appeared to be readying for an assault. They  told residents by loudspeaker to leave the area.
<P>
Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib visited the site to  condemn the perpetrators.
<P>
"They are targeting the Iraqi people and they are trying to  destroy Iraq. These powers won't stop the rebuilding of Iraq,"  he said. "There will be no space for the terrorists and the  enemies of Iraq."
<P>

SURGE IN VIOLENCE
</b>
<P>
Near Mosul, gunmen opened fire on a U.S. patrol Tuesday,  killing one soldier and wounding five, the U.S. military said.
<P>
Since the invasion to oust Saddam Hussein last year, at  least 762 U.S. troops have been killed in action. The total  Pentagon death toll, including non-hostile deaths, is 1,013.
<P>&nbsp;Fighting has surged in Iraq over the last few days after  U.S.-led forces launched a drive to pacify areas of the country  under guerrilla control ahead of elections due in January.
<P>
The American military has mounted several air strikes on  Falluja, a city controlled by insurgents. It says the attacks  have targeted militants loyal to Zarqawi, who they say are  based in the city.
<P>
U.S. forces have also launched an offensive in Tal Afar, a  mainly Turkmen town close to the Syrian border in northern Iraq  which it says has become a haven for foreign fighters.
<P>
The Health Ministry has said at least 60 people were killed  in fighting in Tal Afar over the past week.
