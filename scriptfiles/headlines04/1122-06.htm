<P>WASHINGTON - Angry relatives of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks denounced Congress Sunday for failing to enact broad intelligence reforms aimed at thwarting further terrorist assaults.

<P>"These guys are going to have blood on their hands," said Beverly Eckert, of Stamford, Conn., whose husband was killed when hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center. "It's reprehensible when partisan politics interferes with the safety of the American people."

<P>Congress adjourned Saturday without considering a compromise bill that would have created a new director of national intelligence after Republicans in the House objected that it took too much authority from the Pentagon and did not contain tough new restrictions on immigrants.

<P>Congressional leaders left open a slim possibility on Sunday that lawmakers will attempt to resurrect the bill. But Sen. Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., interviewed on "Fox News Sunday," suggested that the current Congress is unlikely to act without an aggressive push from the president.

<P>ush promised to press ahead for reform.

<P>"I was disappointed that the bill didn't pass," Bush told reporters in Santiago, Chile, where he was attending a summit meeting of Asia Pacific leaders. "It's very clear I wanted the bill passed."

<P>Bush said he had spoken to House leaders in an effort to persuade them to pass the bill and that he still hoped a bill would be passed.

<P>The scuttled legislation would have implemented many of the recommendations of the Sept. 11 investigating commission and was a top priority not only for the Bush administration but for hundreds of Sept. 11 family members who organized to push for enactment of the measure.

<P>Many spent time and money in lobbying lawmakers, testifying before the commission and congressional hearings. Some were on the phone to legislative aides in Washington on Saturday, monitoring the bill's progress.

<P>Sunday, they were outspoken in their dismay.

<P>"They take the lives of many, many people in their hands by being complacent," said Lee Ielpi, 60, a retired New York firefighter whose son, also a firefighter, was killed in responding to the attacks.

<P>"If they don't act, history will repeat itself."

<P>"I'm astounded that a couple of mavericks are so obsessed with their own agenda that they're willing to interfere with making this country safer," said Eckert, repeating a widely shared view of other family members that the bill's failure makes the nation more vulnerable to further terrorism.

<P>Two congressmen, Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., of the House Armed Services Committee, and James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., of the Judiciary Committee, were the most vociferous in their objections to the proposed legislation, which was the result of two months of negotiations to reconcile different versions passed by the Senate and the House.

<P>Eckert, 53, was a leading proponent for creating the Sept. 11 investigating commission and is currently a member of the commission's 50-member family steering committee. Her husband, Sean Rooney, was in the south tower of the World Trade Center when the attacks occurred.

<P>Eckert said she has spent "hundreds of thousands of dollars" and quit her job as an insurance executive to work on behalf of the reforms. She said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., should call House members back into session to pass the bill, saying that a majority of lawmakers appear to support the reforms.

<P>Mary Fetchet of New Canaan, Conn., a founding director of a family advocacy group called Voices of Sept. 11, said the loss of her 24-year-old son, Brad, who also worked in the trade center's south tower, made her a committed activist for the proposed intelligence reforms.

<P>"It's my moral obligation as a parent to know that legislation is in place to make our country safer," she said.

<P>"It's almost negligence to continue to footdrag and continue to protect the status quo ... ," she said. "I would hate to know another parent would have to go through what I went through." <p align="center">&copy; 2004 Knight Ridder/Tribune Information Services</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
