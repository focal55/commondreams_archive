<p>When President Bush travels around the United States, the Secret 
Service visits the location ahead of time and orders local police to set up 
"free speech zones" or "protest zones," where people opposed to Bush policies 
(and sometimes sign-carrying supporters) are quarantined. These zones 
routinely succeed in keeping protesters out of presidential sight and outside 
the view of media covering the event. 
<P>When Bush went to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old 
retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, 
"The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us." 
<P>The local police, at the Secret Service's behest, set up a "designated 
free-speech zone" on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence a third 
of a mile from the location of Bush's speech. 
<P>The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, but 
folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president's path. Neel 
refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct; 
the police also confiscated his sign. 
<P>Neel later commented, "As far as I'm concerned, the whole country is a 
free-speech zone. If the Bush administration has its way, anyone who 
criticizes them will be out of sight and out of mind." 
<P>At Neel's trial, police Detective John Ianachione testified that the 
Secret Service told local police to confine "people that were there making a 
statement pretty much against the president and his views" in a so-called free-
speech area. 
<P>Paul Wolf, one of the top officials in the Allegheny County Police 
Department, told Salon that the Secret Service "come in and do a site survey, 
and say, 'Here's a place where the people can be, and we'd like to have any 
protesters put in a place that is able to be secured.' " 
<P>Pennsylvania District Judge Shirley Rowe Trkula threw out the disorderly 
conduct charge against Neel, declaring, "I believe this is America. Whatever 
happened to 'I don't agree with you, but I'll defend to the death your right 
to say it'?" 
<P>Similar suppressions have occurred during Bush visits to Florida. A 
recent St. Petersburg Times editorial noted, "At a Bush rally at Legends Field 
in 2001, three demonstrators  --  two of whom were grandmothers  --  were 
arrested for holding up small handwritten protest signs outside the designated 
zone. And last year, seven protesters were arrested when Bush came to a rally 
at the USF Sun Dome. They had refused to be cordoned off into a protest zone 
hundreds of yards from the entrance to the Dome." 
<P>One of the arrested protesters was a 62-year-old man holding up a sign, 
"War is good business. Invest your sons." The seven were charged with 
trespassing, "obstructing without violence and disorderly conduct." 
<P>Police have repressed protesters during several Bush visits to the St. 
Louis area as well. When Bush visited on Jan. 22, 150 people carrying signs 
were shunted far away from the main action and effectively quarantined. 
<P>Denise Lieberman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern 
Missouri commented, "No one could see them from the street. In addition, the 
media were not allowed to talk to them. The police would not allow any media 
inside the protest area and wouldn't allow any of the protesters out of the 
protest zone to talk to the media." 
<P>When Bush stopped by a Boeing plant to talk to workers, Christine Mains 
and her 5-year-old daughter disobeyed orders to move to a small protest area 
far from the action. Police arrested Mains and took her and her crying 
daughter away in separate squad cars. 
<P>The Justice Department is now prosecuting Brett Bursey, who was arrested 
for holding a "No War for Oil" sign at a Bush visit to Columbia, S.C. Local 
police, acting under Secret Service orders, established a "free-speech zone" 
half a mile from where Bush would speak. Bursey was standing amid hundreds of 
people carrying signs praising the president. Police told Bursey to remove 
himself to the "free-speech zone." 
<P>Bursey refused and was arrested. Bursey said that he asked the police 
officer if "it was the content of my sign, and he said, 'Yes, sir, it's the 
content of your sign that's the problem.' " Bursey stated that he had already 
moved 200 yards from where Bush was supposed to speak. Bursey later complained,
"The problem was, the restricted area kept moving. It was wherever I happened 
to be standing." 
<P>Bursey was charged with trespassing. Five months later, the charge was 
dropped because South Carolina law prohibits arresting people for trespassing 
on public property. But the Justice Department  --  in the person of U.S. 
Attorney Strom Thurmond Jr.   --  quickly jumped in, charging Bursey with 
violating a rarely enforced federal law regarding "entering a restricted area 
around the president of the United States." 
<P>If convicted, Bursey faces a six-month trip up the river and a $5,000 
fine. Federal Magistrate Bristow Marchant denied Bursey's request for a jury 
trial because his violation is categorized as a petty offense. Some observers 
believe that the feds are seeking to set a precedent in a conservative state 
such as South Carolina that could then be used against protesters nationwide. 
<P>Bursey's trial took place on Nov. 12 and 13. His lawyers sought the 
Secret Service documents they believed would lay out the official policies on 
restricting critical speech at presidential visits. The Bush administration 
sought to block all access to the documents, but Marchant ruled that the 
lawyers could have limited access.
<P>Bursey sought to subpoena Attorney General John Ashcroft and presidential 
adviser Karl Rove to testify. Bursey lawyer Lewis Pitts declared, "We intend 
to find out from Mr. Ashcroft why and how the decision to prosecute Mr. Bursey 
was reached." The magistrate refused, however, to enforce the subpoenas. 
Secret Service agent Holly Abel testified at the trial that Bursey was told to 
move to the "free-speech zone" but refused to cooperate. 
<P>The feds have offered some bizarre rationales for hog-tying protesters. 
Secret Service agent Brian Marr explained to National Public Radio, "These 
individuals may be so involved with trying to shout their support or 
nonsupport that inadvertently they may walk out into the motorcade route and 
be injured. And that is really the reason why we set these places up, so we 
can make sure that they have the right of free speech, but, two, we want to be 
sure that they are able to go home at the end of the evening and not be 
injured in any way." Except for having their constitutional rights shredded. 
<P>The ACLU, along with several other organizations, is suing the Secret 
Service for what it charges is a pattern and practice of suppressing 
protesters at Bush events in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Michigan, New 
Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and elsewhere. The ACLU's Witold Walczak said of the 
protesters, "The individuals we are talking about didn't pose a security 
threat; they posed a political threat." 
<P>The Secret Service is duty-bound to protect the president. But it is 
ludicrous to presume that would-be terrorists are lunkheaded enough to carry 
anti-Bush signs when carrying pro-Bush signs would give them much closer 
access. And even a policy of removing all people carrying signs  --  as has 
happened in some demonstrations  --  is pointless because potential attackers 
would simply avoid carrying signs. Assuming that terrorists are as 
unimaginative and predictable as the average federal bureaucrat is not a 
recipe for presidential longevity. 
<P>The Bush administration's anti-protester bias proved embarrassing for two 
American allies with long traditions of raucous free speech, resulting in some 
of the most repressive restrictions in memory in free countries. 
<P>When Bush visited Australia in October, Sydney Morning Herald columnist 
Mark Riley observed, "The basic right of freedom of speech will adopt a new 
interpretation during the Canberra visits this week by George Bush and his 
Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao. Protesters will be free to speak as much as 
they like just as long as they can't be heard."
<P>Demonstrators were shunted to an area away from the Federal Parliament 
building and prohibited from using any public address system in the area. 
<P>For Bush's recent visit to London, the White House demanded that British 
police ban all protest marches, close down the center of the city and impose a 
"virtual three-day shutdown of central London in a bid to foil disruption of 
the visit by anti-war protesters," according to Britain's Evening Standard. 
But instead of a "free-speech zone," the Bush administration demanded an 
"exclusion zone" to protect Bush from protesters' messages. 
<P>Such unprecedented restrictions did not inhibit Bush from portraying 
himself as a champion of freedom during his visit. In a speech at Whitehall on 
Nov. 19, Bush hyped the "forward strategy of freedom" and declared, "We seek 
the advance of freedom and the peace that freedom brings." 
<P>Attempts to suppress protesters become more disturbing in light of the 
Homeland Security Department's recommendation that local police departments 
view critics of the war on terrorism as potential terrorists. In a May 
terrorist advisory, the Homeland Security Department warned local law 
enforcement agencies to keep an eye on anyone who "expressed dislike of 
attitudes and decisions of the U.S. government." If police vigorously followed 
this advice, millions of Americans could be added to the official lists of 
suspected terrorists. 
<P>Protesters have claimed that police have assaulted them during 
demonstrations in New York, Washington and elsewhere. 
<P>One of the most violent government responses to an antiwar protest 
occurred when local police and the federally funded California Anti-Terrorism 
Task Force fired rubber bullets and tear gas at peaceful protesters and 
innocent bystanders at the Port of Oakland, injuring a number of people.
<P>When the police attack sparked a geyser of media criticism, Mike van 
Winkle, the spokesman for the California Anti-Terrorism Information Center 
told the Oakland Tribune, "You can make an easy kind of a link that, if you 
have a protest group protesting a war where the cause that's being fought 
against is international terrorism, you might have terrorism at that protest. 
You can almost argue that a protest against that is a terrorist act." 
<P>Van Winkle justified classifying protesters as terrorists: "I've heard 
terrorism described as anything that is violent or has an economic impact, and 
shutting down a port certainly would have some economic impact. Terrorism 
isn't just bombs going off and killing people." 
<P>Such aggressive tactics become more ominous in the light of the Bush 
administration's advocacy, in its Patriot II draft legislation, of nullifying 
all judicial consent decrees restricting state and local police from spying on 
those groups who may oppose government policies. 
<P>On May 30, 2002, Ashcroft effectively abolished restrictions on FBI 
surveillance of Americans' everyday lives first imposed in 1976. One FBI 
internal newsletter encouraged FBI agents to conduct more interviews with 
antiwar activists "for plenty of reasons, chief of which it will enhance the 
paranoia endemic in such circles and will further service to get the point 
across that there is an FBI agent behind every mailbox." 
<P>The FBI took a shotgun approach toward protesters partly because of the 
FBI's "belief that dissident speech and association should be prevented 
because they were incipient steps toward the possible ultimate commission of 
act which might be criminal," according to a Senate report. 
<P>On Nov. 23 news broke that the FBI is actively conducting surveillance of 
antiwar demonstrators, supposedly to "blunt potential violence by extremist 
elements," according to a Reuters interview with a federal law enforcement 
official. 
<P>Given the FBI's expansive definition of "potential violence" in the past, 
this is a net that could catch almost any group or individual who falls into 
official disfavor.
