<P>FALLUJA  - After the latest U.S. air strike  on Falluja, enraged residents clasped wounded children and  challenged Iraq's prime minister to visit the town to see how  bombs were hitting civilians, not "terrorists."
<P>
"Is this a terrorist? Is this a terrorist? Iyad Allawi come  and show us the terrorists," screamed a man as he fixed a  bandage on the head of a small boy in his arms.
<P>
A U.S. warplane struck Falluja late Friday night, the  latest in a weeks-long campaign of bombardments the U.S.  military says are targeting hideouts used by followers of  Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the most hunted man in  Iraq.
<P>
Falluja, 50 km (30 miles) west of Baghdad, has been in  rebel hands since U.S. forces withdrew following a failed  offensive on the city in April.
<P>
Since the handover of power to an Iraqi government in June,  U.S. forces are supposed to get a green light from the Iraqi  government before conducting any air strikes. But many Iraqis  believe Washington often acts of its own accord.
<P>
The U.S. military has repeatedly said that it conducts air  strikes on Falluja only when it has specific intelligence and  says that it only makes "precision strikes" on those targets.
<P>
After Friday's attack, hospital officials said at least  seven civilians were killed and 13 wounded. Reuters television  pictures showed Iraqis digging through mounds of rubble and  twisted metal hoping to find survivors.
<P>
At one point, a child no older than 10 was pulled alive  from under a pile of bricks and dust.
<P>
U.S. military officials have suggested that insurgents have  pressured doctors into exaggerating casualty tolls and have  cast doubt on television footage, indicating that scenes after  air strikes may have been staged.
<P>
Reuters television footage of the destruction after Friday  night's strike showed panicked men using their bare hands to  dig out bodies. One man lay face down, covered by a heavy slab  of cement over his waist and legs.
<P>
Such scenes are familiar to the people of Falluja, who say  they have seen no evidence backing U.S. assertions that  insurgents and foreign fighters were operating from houses that  are flattened by U.S. warplanes.
<P>
Amid the screams and groans of children having their wounds  stitched at a Falluja hospital Saturday, a young girl pulled  dead from the rubble lay on thin mat on the floor.
<P>
Allawi's U.S.-backed government is scrambling to regain  control of several rebel-held cities before elections are due  in January, and put an end to suicide bombings that have killed  hundreds of Iraqi police and civilians.
<P>
As part of that campaign, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched an  offensive against the rebel stronghold of Samarra early on  Friday, killing more than 100 insurgents in fierce fighting.
<P>
The U.S. military has said the air raids on Falluja have  killed scores of militants loyal to Zarqawi, who's group  Washington says is allied to Osama bin Laden. It recently said  as many as 100 of Zarqawi's followers had been killed in aerial  bombardments and other strikes.
