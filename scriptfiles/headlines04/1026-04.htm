<p>BERLIN - Determined to make sure their voices
count, some American expatriates who missed registration
deadlines or are worried about the reliability of absentee
ballots are flying home next week just to vote.

Paying up to &#36;1,300 for transatlantic journeys to states as
far away as Arizona, at least five Americans in Europe believe
Tuesday's presidential election is so important, and so close,
that their votes are worth the expense and effort.
<p>
 About six million expatriates are eligible but a
complicated maze of different rules in each of the 50 states,
delays in obtaining absentee ballots and concerns about the
mail have left many who are eager to vote still nervously
waiting for ballots.
<p>

 While some are making frantic calls to state voting offices
or groups representing overseas Democrats or Republicans,
others have decided the only solution is to fly to the United
States.
<p>
 "George W. Bush is not the right man for the job and that's
why I'm paying to get on a plane to make sure I get over and
vote," said B. Carter Looney, 39, a U.S. businessman who lives
near Frankfurt.
<p>
 "There's more to the world than just the United States,"
said Looney, who will spend 26 hours airborne for just three
days in Arizona before returning Tuesday after voting.
<p>
 Looney, overseas for 17 years, voted in every contest
before 2000, but said he felt ill for a long time after missing
the last election because his absentee ballot arrived too late.
<p>
 "I vowed it wouldn't happen again," he said.
<p>
 FLYING HOME
<p>
 George Nascaris, an American pharmaceutical executive
living in Berlin, said he will fly to New York City Monday,
vote for Bush Tuesday, and then fly back to Germany Wednesday.
<p>

 "I want to make sure my vote counts," said Nascaris, who
has lived abroad since 1999. "Every vote might make a
difference."
<p>
Nascaris said some are bewildered by his 1,000-euro journey
to a state that Bush's Democratic challenger John Kerry  is
likely to win but that won't dampen his enthusiasm to vote.
<p>
 "It's a tight situation and you never know until the polls
close. Let the best horse win," he said.
<p>
 About 270,000 Americans live in Germany, the world's fourth
largest U.S. expatriate group after Mexico, Canada and Britain.
<p>
 In the Netherlands, Steve Weiss discovered he missed
Florida's September deadline for absentee ballots and then
decided he would fly home to vote on Nov. 2.
<p>
 "This is a critical election and I wanted to participate in
the process," said Weiss, a banker who has lived abroad for
four years and now heads the Republicans Abroad in the
Netherlands.
<p>

 "It's going to be very exciting in Florida and I thought it
would be a lot of fun to stand in line, vote and watch the
returns," said Weiss, who will start a 17-hour journey through
London and New York to Miami Thursday. "I want to be there."
<p>
 Randal Wall, head of voter assistance for Democrats Abroad
in Germany, has been bombarded with requests for help from
Americans who registered but haven't got absentee ballots.
<p>
"Some are frustrated, some are angry, and some break down
and cry because they feel so strongly about wanting a chance to
vote. I've never seen an election as emotional as this before."
<p>
In France, U.S. opera singer Alexandra Hughes, 53, said she
would make an extra trip from Paris Monday morning to vote in
New York for Kerry Tuesday.
<p>
"I was incredibly angry that my absentee ballot never
arrived in 2000," said Hughes. "I want to be sure I'm there.
Too many mistakes happen with absentee ballots and we all know
what happened in Florida."
<p>
In Italy, a 30-year-old from Illinois said he was going to
take a week off from his job in Rome to vote in Oak Park.
<p>
In Ireland, some Americans scheduled business trips home to
cast their ballots. "A few people probably did arrange business
travel to coincide with the election," said chairwoman Rebecca
Woolf of Democrats Abroad in the country.
