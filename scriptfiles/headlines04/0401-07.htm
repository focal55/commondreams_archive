BAGHDAD - A high-profile U.S.-sponsored trade  fair for companies rebuilding Iraq was postponed Thursday, a  day after the grisly killing and mutilation of four American  security contractors deepened fears of worsening security.<p>

Iraq's U.S. governor, Paul Bremer, vowed to hunt down those  responsible for ambushing the American workers in the restive  city of Falluja, and those who then torched the bodies and  dragged them through the streets before hanging them from a  bridge.<p> 
			
			"Yesterday's events in Falluja are a dramatic example of  the ongoing struggle between human dignity and barbarism,"  Bremer said in a terse address at a police graduation ceremony.<p> 
			
			"The acts we have seen were despicable and inexcusable.  They violate the tenets of all religions, Islam included, as  well as the foundations of civilized society. Their deaths will  not go unpunished."<p> 
			
			Television footage of jubilant Iraqis mutilating the bodies  recalled events in Mogadishu in 1993, when a crowd dragged the  bodies of American soldiers through the streets, hastening the  departure of U.S. forces from Somalia.<p> 
			
			The Falluja violence sparked renewed concern among foreign  organizations operating in Iraq.<p> 
			
			Organizers of the <a href="http://www.dbxexpo.com/index1.asp" target="_new">Baghdad Expo</a>, a major trade fair that had  been due to start Monday, said it was postponed -- a blow to  U.S. efforts to draw investment to Iraq and project an image of  a stable country conducive to doing business.
			<p> 
			
			No new date was set for the event.<p> 
			
			International companies hoping to win a slice of Iraqi  reconstruction had been due to take part in the exhibition,  along with U.S. companies that have won most of the contracts  Washington has awarded to rebuild Iraq so far.<p> 
			
			Many companies had expressed concern about security at the  trade fair -- the site where it was due to be held was rocketed  last month, and Baghdad's main hotels have also been attacked  repeatedly with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.<p> 
			
			Washington hopes economic growth in Iraq will help  undermine the guerrilla insurgency, but so far, the lack of  stability and security in some parts of Iraq has hampered  reconstruction.<p> 
			
			CONVOY ATTACKED<p> 
			
			In a new attack Thursday, guerrillas detonated a roadside  bomb as a U.S. convoy passed near Falluja, 32 miles west of  Baghdad. The U.S. Army said three soldiers were wounded.<p> 
			
			One Humvee, left behind by American soldiers at the site of  the attack, was later set ablaze by a crowd of Iraqis.<p> 
			
			On Wednesday, a roadside bomb attack in the same area  killed five U.S. soldiers. At least 407 American troops have  been killed in action in Iraq since U.S.-led forces invaded  last March to topple Saddam Hussein.<p> 
			
			Also Wednesday, a car bomb attack in the nearby town of  Ramadi killed six Iraqis and wounded five, the U.S. Army said.  It gave no details on the circumstances or target of the blast.<p> 
			
			The U.S. military death toll last month was the second  highest of any month since President Bush declared major combat  over on May 1 last year.<p> 
			
			At least 50 American troops died in Iraq in March,  according to Pentagon figures. The deadliest month for U.S.  forces was November, when 82 U.S. troops died.<p> 
			
			Guerrilla attacks in March also killed at least 16 foreign  civilians, including the four who died in Falluja Wednesday.<p> 
			
			On Sunday, a Briton and a Canadian, both working as  security officers, were shot and killed in Mosul.<p> 
			
			Earlier in March, two Finns were killed in Baghdad, and  four U.S. missionaries were shot to death in Mosul. In Hilla,  south of Baghdad, two Americans working for the U.S. civilian  authority were killed in a drive-by shooting, and in the same  area of Iraq a German and a Dutch engineer were shot and  killed.<p> 
			
			In Basra, a mainly Shi'ite city 340 miles south of Baghdad,  at least one Iraqi was killed Thursday in clashes between Iraqi  police and about 100 protesters demanding salaries. The  protesters threw stones and set tires on fire.
