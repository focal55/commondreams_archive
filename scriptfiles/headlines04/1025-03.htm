<p>Confusion surrounded the fate of the Iraq aid worker Margaret Hassan last night after main rebel groups denied being involved with her kidnap.</p>
<p>Insurgents in Fallujah condemned the abduction of the charity chief who was snatched by an armed gang in Baghdad six days ago. Despite making a video of the hostage in captivity, the kidnappers have not been pictured or made any claim of responsibility.</p>
<p>The statement by the Fallujah group came a day after the husband of Irish-born Mrs Hassan made an plea for her release on an Arabic TV station.</p>
<p>"This woman works for a humanitarian organization. She should not have been kidnapped," the emir, or commander, of one group of Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah told Reuters reporters.</p>
<p>"She had been living in Iraq for 30 years and she was a humanitarian. The resistance did not kidnap her because this would have left a bad impression of the resistance in the world," he added.</p>

<p>Commanders of five separate guerrilla groups in Fallujah said they were not holding Mrs Hassan and had seen no evidence that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's organization had kidnapped her.</p>
<p>The US military and Iraqi government officials say Fallujah is a base for foreign militants loyal to Zarqawi, a Jordanian whose group has claimed responsibility for kidnappings and murders, including that of British hostage Ken Bigley.</p>
<p>Mrs Hassan, who worked in Iraq for the aid agency Care International and holds British and Iraqi citizenship, was seized on Tuesday. She appeared on a video on Arabic al-Jazeera television on Friday making a tearful plea for her life.</p>
<p>On Saturday, her husband Tahseen Ali Hassan begged for her to be freed "in the name of Islam", as he appeared on another station, al-Arabiya.</p>
<p>"It hurts to watch my wife cry," he said. "This scene has saddened and worried her friends and loved ones. I plead with you, in the name of Islam and Arabism - while we are in the most sacred Islamic month - that my wife and beloved return to me."</p>
<p>Charity Care International has also pleaded for Mrs Hassan to be freed in a statement read on al-Jazeera by the organization's secretary general, Denis Caillaux.</p>
<p>He said she was dedicated to the Iraqi people and added: "She is a naturalized Iraqi citizen and always holds the people of Iraq in her heart."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Office refused to be drawn on a Sunday newspaper report that British security officials were trying to find the intermediary who established contact with the captors of Ken Bigley during his kidnap ordeal.</p>
<p>It was claimed they want to ascertain if she is being held by the group which seized and eventually killed Mr Bigley.</p>

<p>The report also said Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw had been asked to take a back seat in appeals for her release with Care International taking the lead.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesman would only reiterate that efforts were continuing on her behalf, saying: "We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities to secure Margaret's release."</p>
<p>Mrs Hassan, who was born in Dublin, appeared in a video shown on al-Jazeera on Friday.</p>
<p>She looked tired and distraught in the video as she called on Tony Blair to pull out of Iraq and not to send troops to Baghdad. </p>
