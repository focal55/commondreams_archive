<P>ROME - Britain's ambassador to Italy has called  President Bush "the best recruiting sergeant" for al Qaeda,  Italian media reported Monday.
<P>
The comment, made at a closed-door conference at the  weekend, was denounced by one leading Italian newspaper editor,  who issued an open letter snubbing the veteran ambassador, Sir  Ivor Roberts.
<P>
Roberts was quoted as telling an annual Anglo-Italian  gathering in Tuscany: "If anyone is ready to celebrate the  eventual re-election of Bush, it's al Qaeda."
<P>
Corriere della Sera newspaper said Roberts also told the  meeting of British and Italian policy-makers: "Bush is al  Qaeda's best recruiting sergeant."
<P>
The British embassy in Rome declined to comment about the  remarks, saying the Tuscan conference had been covered by the  so-called Chatham House Rules, which means that anything said  by delegates should remain off the record.
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is President Bush's  strongest ally in Europe.
<P>
Giuliano Ferrara, outspoken editor of the conservative Il  Foglio broadsheet, wrote an open letter saying he would boycott  a previously scheduled dinner with the ambassador Monday.
<P>
"The dinner unfortunately would be a complete waste of time  and a grotesque hypocrisy," he said.
<P>
Ferrara added that he would prefer to have supper with the  French ambassador to Italy "who loyally represents in Rome Mr  Jacques Chirac."
<P>
Ferrara is a fervent supporter of the U.S.-led war on Iraq.
<P>
Roberts was British ambassador to Yugoslavia in the  mid-1990s, helping negotiations between the international  community and Yugoslav authorities. He then served as British  ambassador to Ireland before his Italian posting.</p>
