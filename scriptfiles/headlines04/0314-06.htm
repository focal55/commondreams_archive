<p>Stephen Funk is only 21, and would like to go back to his quiet life,
but he knows he's become too much of a public, polarizing figure.
<P>That comes with being what activists say is the first public 
conscientious objector of the Iraq war; certainly the only one jailed for his 
beliefs. Released from a North Carolina military prison last month after 
serving six months for "unauthorized absence" from his Marine Reserve unit 
based in San Jose, Funk is coming home to San Francisco as a hero to anti-war 
activists.

Funk will be feted at 3 p.m. today  at a "welcome home" fund-raiser in 
Oakland to benefit the anti-war organization Not In Our Name and his legal 
defense. It is billed as, "local anti-war hero returns home from military brig.
''
<P>To the Marines, Funk was court-martialed for not showing up for 47 days 
after his unit was called to active duty Feb. 13, 2003. They court-martialed 
him, sent him to the brig, then gave him a bad conduct discharge. He has lost 
all his military benefits.
<P>"He was never a C.O. (conscientious objector); he just never showed up," 
said Marine Capt. Jeff Pool, a Marine Forces Reserve spokesman. "As far as the 
military goes, he just wasn't where he was supposed to be when he was supposed 
to be."
<P>To Funk, the truth is somewhere in between those perceptions.
<P>"It's been really polarizing," Funk said recently as he sat in the 
offices of International ANSWER, which sponsors most of the antiwar rallies in 
San Francisco and across the country. He is scheduled to speak at an anti-war 
rally Saturday in San Francisco. "People were unrealistically calling me a 
hero and people were unrealistically calling me a demon.
<P>"My decision was a very personal one. I did it for myself. I didn't do it 
to make a point or for some other reason," he said.
<P>He did it because he did not want to kill anyone. And he didn't want to 
encourage anyone else to, either.
<P>Funk is a bridge between two worlds. One is the Marines, where only 23 
reservists applied for conscientious objector status in 2003; 17 requests were 
granted. Only one reservist asked the year before, according to a Marine 
spokesman.
<P>As Funk retraces his life, it's hard to see the evolution of a Marine 
recruit from his other, liberal world. Before basic training, he had never 
fired a gun or even gotten into a fight. Attending what he calls "a very 
liberal" high school in his native Seattle, he read progressive icons Noam 
Chomsky and Howard Zinn and participated in the World Trade Organization 
street protests there in 1999. When he attended the University of Southern 
California, he protested the Democratic National Convention in 2000 and voted 
for Green Party nominee Ralph Nader for president.
<P>But USC wasn't a good fit, and after one year, he moved to the Bay Area. 
Here, he continued to drift, which is when he got an unsolicited call from a 
Marine recruiter. He took the recruiter up on an offer to attend an event at 
Camp Parks in Dublin. He enjoyed the camaraderie, and soon after he got home, 
he decided to join. He didn't tell anyone until two weeks before shipping out.
<P>"I was lacking direction and I needed a sense of belonging, and I wanted 
some discipline," he said. "I thought the Marines would provide that."
<P>But he knew, he said, "as soon I set foot" in Camp Pendleton in San Diego 
County for basic training that this wasn't the life for him. He couldn't punch 
his fellow recruits during hand-to-hand combat drills, and when he was ordered 
to say "Kill! Kill!" during other exercises, "I'd say 'Jill! Jill!' Or 'Phil! 
Phil!' " Funk said.
<P>Before he finished his Marine training, he started trying to figure out 
how to get out. He began his conscientious objector paperwork and attended 
several anti-war rallies in San Francisco. When his Marine Reserve pals found 
out, they began calling him "Anti-war Funk."
<P>He didn't show up for training because his paperwork wasn't completed. 
When he handed it in, he realized that in addition to walking the media 
gauntlet for failing to report, he would have to face publicly something that 
only his immediate family and a few friends knew: He is gay.
<P>He will continue to speak out about the war and his experience, but his 
main goal is to get a job and reapply to school. He wants a job working with 
animals. Still, the polarizing aspect of his life is never far behind.
<P>When he filed a rental application for a Sunset District home, the 

landlord called to say he had been rejected; he had admitted he was a felon on 
the application. When he explained why, "the landlord said, 'Oh, I remember 
you.' And then she said OK. And knocked $100 off the rent."
