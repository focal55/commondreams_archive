<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>As US Vice-President Dick Cheney promised this week that the new
Bush team would "serve and guard the country we love", student
rent-a-crowds were burning effigies of his leader and his flag in
Tehran.</p>

<p>The state-choreographed protest was to mark the 25th anniversary
of the 1979 hostage drama at the US embassy in the Iranian
capital.</p>
<p>These two countries are on a new collision course - this time
over the conviction by Washington and others that Tehran is
covertly developing weapons in tandem with a nuclear energy program
which the Iranian leadership insists is civilian and purely
peaceful.</p>
<p>The bitterness is deep. Senior Iranian officials used the
anniversary of the humiliating 444-day detention of 52 American
diplomats to mock the newly re-elected Bush and the US as "the
great Satan".</p>
<p>In his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush memorably named
Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as the "axis of evil" as he
assessed threats to US national security after September 11,
2001.</p>
<p>European countries have worked feverishly to keep the Iran
crisis within a diplomatic framework. But the risk in Tehran's
"We've got nothing to lose" posturing and in Bush's pre-election
form and post-election rhetoric, is that each will perform as the
caricatures they have become - facing off as Tehran Terror v
Bullyboy Bush.</p>
<p>The Americans have little faith in the diplomatic process. And
given their unilateralism and pre-emptive strikes in response to
the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the world
would be unwise to rule out the possibility of Bush being persuaded
by the re-energised neoconservatives to complete a regional
trifecta of military strikes - Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran.</p>
<p>In his first term, there were good reasons for Bush keeping a
low profile on Iran. He and his team were preoccupied with the
bungled aftermath of their invasion of Iraq, Iran's western
neighbour. And more recently they have begun to recognise a crisis
that has the potential to destroy the fledgling democracy they are
building in Afghanistan, Iran's eastern neighbour.</p>
<p>Despite the global celebration of the October 9 presidential
election in Afghanistan, Administration officials are concluding
that their failure in the three years since invasion to check a
burgeoning opium poppy economy means that Afghanistan could become
an ungovernable narco-state.</p>
<p>But events in the coming months could shape Iran as the
Iraq-like crisis of the second Bush term. There is widespread
speculation in Washington and other capitals that, even before
Tuesday's US election, the Administration's hardliners were
sketching plans for an Iran campaign.</p>

<p>Last week the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> quoted Reuel Marc
Gerecht, a former CIA Middle East analyst turned conservative
commentator, as saying: "I've heard discussion of between 20 and 40
[suspected Iranian nuclear] sites you'd want to hit to deter the
program."</p>
<p>The Administration was "very seriously" studying the possibility
of military action against Iran, said Michael Rubin, a former US
adviser in Baghdad who is a scholar at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute in Washington.</p>
<p>And such is the credence being given to the idea that the US
might acquiesce in an Israeli strike on the Iranian plants, that
this week the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, was wheeled out to
deny it. It would not be a first - in 1981 Israeli jets destroyed a
partly constructed nuclear facility in Iraq.</p>
<p>From an Arab and Muslim perspective, it is hardly surprising
that Iran would pursue a nuclear program.</p>
<p>The US has always turned a blind eye to Israel's nuclear arsenal
and to its stubborn refusal to sign up for non-proliferation or for
international supervision of its program.</p>
<p>Like Saddam Hussein before it, Iran is positioning itself as a
counter to Israeli force in the region. And that is the crux of it
- the hardline argument in Washington and Israel is that, armed
with nuclear weapons, Iran would be a risk to the region. It might
share its nuclear technology with terrorists or it could threaten
strikes on Israel or other US interests.</p>
<p>On Thursday Britain's Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, ruled out
the use of US military force against Iran, telling the BBC: "The
prospect is inconceivable - I don't see any circumstances in which
military action would be justified against Iran, full stop."</p>

<p>And Karsten Voigt, who co-ordinates relations with the US in the
German Foreign Ministry, told reporters: "The Europeans - the
British, French and Germans - are seeking a peaceful solution. But
the goal is to prevent, together with the Americans, Iran gaining
access to nuclear weapons."</p>
<p>British, French and German diplomats were downcast about the
prospects for a meeting in Paris yesterday, at which they would
again offer an Iranian delegation a range of incentives if Tehran
agreed to abandon its plans for enriching uranium.</p>
<p>These talks have been going on for three years, but all Straw
would say before the Paris meeting was: "It is difficult
negotiating with Iran."</p>
<p>The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency was said to
be equally resigned to failure, but some reports suggested the
Iranians might attempt to buy time by going part of the way towards
a compromise.</p>
<p>Deadlock could leave the Europeans with little room to move,
despite their resentment, shared by the agency's board of
governors, over Washington's bogus claims about Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction as part of the case for war against Saddam
Hussein.</p>
<p>If the Paris meeting failed, the Europeans might have to back a
US demand that a meeting of the agency on November 25 refer Iran to
the UN Security Council, where it could be targeted with economic
sanctions.</p>
<p>But Vienna-based diplomats also said that the agency's head,
Mohamed ElBaradei, might try to thwart the US. It is thought his
report to the meeting may question the extent to which Iran's fuel
cycle activities are out of proportion with the rest of its nuclear
program, but at the same time state that his staff have found no
evidence of the diversion of nuclear material to weapons.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the US is obliged to focus on its attempts to
control events in Iraq.</p>
<p>It hopes a planned assault on Falluja might prove the
effectiveness of Iraq's new security forces, which are so
distrusted by their American trainers and minders that often their
weapons are confiscated.</p>

<p>This is the weakness in the US exit plan in Iraq. The theory is
that if the Iraqi forces can be trained to impose security, then
the US can pull back as all the elements of a democracy fall into
place.</p>
<p>But the insurgency still has a grip on parts of the country and
exasperated US officers are constantly accusing Iraqi police and
military recruits of providing strategic information to the
insurgents.</p>
<p>After last month's execution of 49 military trainees, who were
unarmed because they were not trusted to keep their weapons during
home visits, a senior Iraqi official told <i>Newsweek</i>: "The
infiltration is all over, from the top to the bottom, from
decision-making to the lower levels."</p>
<p>One of his colleagues added: "Things are getting really bad. The
initiative is in [the insurgents'] hands right now. This approach
of being lenient and accommodating has really backfired - they see
this as weakness."</p>
<p>Despite Washington's hopes and predictions, the insurgency gets
stronger and bolder.</p>
<p>The US hopes that an all-out assault on Falluja will change
that, but the likelihood is that when the Marines fight their way
into the city, most of its defenders will have melted away to fight
in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>In which case, the fighting will continue, the elections that
the US wants to be held in January will be in doubt and so will be
democracy in Iraq.</p>
<p>In the first Bush term, only two people in the presidential loop
had the opportunity to challenge his insistence that the Iraq
adventure had to be a part of the "war on terror" - Tony Blair and
Colin Powell.</p>

<p>History will remember both of them as the flawed individuals who
went along for a dangerous ride instead of getting off the bus.</p>
<p>With Powell widely reported to be ready to pack his broken
principles and quit as Secretary of State, Blair may be left
alone.</p>
<p>This week he came in on cue - making yet another empty call for
the US to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Why would
Bush listen to him when he has never done so in the past? Why might
the Palestinians believe him, when he has delivered nothing despite
all his pious words?</p>
<p>Blair has been Bush-whacked before. He'll be bushwhacked
again.</p>© Copyright 2004 The Los Angeles Times
