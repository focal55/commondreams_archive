GENEVA - The Red Cross discovered "serious violations" of the rights of Iraqi prisoners, with abuse so widespread it may be considered to have been tolerated by the U.S.-led coalition, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday. 

<p>

 In a confidential 24-page document, which was seen by the

financial newspaper, the International Committee of the Red

Cross said treatment in some cases was "tantamount to torture,"

particularly when interrogators were seeking information or

confessions.

 <p>

 An official at the Geneva-based ICRC said the document,

covering the period March-November 2003, was genuine, adding

that the leak was a "major breakdown in confidentiality."

 <p>

 In a rare break with its normal practice, the ICRC said

that it would release the full text at a 1400 GMT news

conference.

 <p>

 The use of ill-treatment "went beyond exceptional cases and

might be considered a practice tolerated" by coalition forces,

the newspaper quoted the ICRC as saying.

 <p>

 That differs sharply from the view of senior officials in

the administration of President Bush  that military higher-ups

had not condoned abuse, the newspaper said.

 <p>

 In the report, the ICRC said prisoners at Baghdad's Abu

Ghraib prison were held in empty cells naked and beaten by

soldiers. Three former military policemen at the prison told

Reuters on Thursday that abuse was commonplace.

 <p>

 The aid group also said coalition forces fired on unarmed

prisoners from watchtowers and killed some of them, as well as

committing "serious violations" of the Geneva Conventions

governing treatment of war prisoners, the Journal said.

 <p>

 The newspaper report comes a day after the Red Cross said

on Thursday it had repeatedly urged the United States to take

"corrective action" at a Baghdad jail at the center of a

scandal over abuse of Iraqi prisoners.

 <p>

 The Geneva-based humanitarian agency, mandated under

international treaties to visit detainees, has had regular

access to Abu Ghraib prison since U.S.-led forces began using

it last year, a Red Cross spokeswoman said.

 
<p>

 Pictures of grinning U.S. soldiers abusing naked Iraqis at

Abu Ghraib -- the largest prison in the country and notorious

for torture under Iraqi President Saddam Hussein -- have

sparked an international outcry.
