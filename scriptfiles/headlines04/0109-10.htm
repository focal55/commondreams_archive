<p>WASHINGTON  - The United States has formally  declared Saddam Hussein, held by U.S. forces since his Dec. 13  capture, an enemy prisoner of war, the Pentagon said on Friday,  and the International Committee of the Red Cross asked to see  Iraq's former president as soon as possible.<p> 
			
							The Pentagon's first official statement about the  66-year-old captive's legal status means Saddam is due a host  of rights spelled out by the Geneva Convention on treatment of  prisoners of war.<p> 
			
							"Saddam's status is that he is an enemy prisoner of war.  The lawyers have determined that," chief Pentagon spokesman  Lawrence Di Rita told reporters late on Friday, adding Defense  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was informed of the determination  earlier in the day.<p> 
			
							The treaty requires that the International Committee of the  Red Cross have access to POWs. Christophe Girod, the senior  ICRC official in Washington, said the organization was speaking  with U.S. officials in Baghdad about gaining access to Saddam  to check the conditions in which he is being held.<p> 
			
							The Geneva Convention requires that POWs receive humane  treatment, including not being subjected to intimidation or  insult and not being turned into a public curiosity. It  requires that POWs be given proper food and freedom, be free to  exercise their religion and receive monthly pay depending on  rank.<p> 
			
							Air Force Maj. Michael Shavers, a Pentagon spokesman, said  Saddam was being given all the rights due him under the treaty.<p> 
			
							"The bottom line is that Saddam Hussein was the leader of  the old regime's military forces, and therefore he was a member  of the military, and he was captured. That makes him an enemy  prisoner of war," Shavers said.<p> 
			
							"It's unusual that you have such a high-ranking enemy  prisoner of war. So I think we just wanted to make sure that we  had carefully thought through all the ramifications," Shavers  said.<p> 
			
							Di Rita did not rule out the possibility the United States  might re-evaluate Saddam's POW status in the future, but  declined to say under what circumstances that would occur.<p> 
			
							'NOT UPSET YET'<p> 
			
							Girod expressed hope the United States would allow the ICRC  to see Saddam in "the not-too-far future," perhaps in a few  days or weeks. "We don't have any negative signals that we  would not have access," Girod said.<p> 
			
							Girod stressed the ICRC wanted the meeting "as soon as  possible -- the sooner the better," but noted the Geneva  Convention did not set a specific timetable for such access.<p> 
			
							"We are not upset yet," Girod said.<p> 
			
							Saddam was seized in a hole in the ground during a raid  last month on a farm near his hometown of Tikrit.<p> 
			
							U.S. authorities continue to interrogate Saddam at an  undisclosed location in Iraq with the CIA taking the lead role.  A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  Saddam was "talking some, but not as much as we would want, and  not about the kinds of things we would like."<p> 
			
							"He is only required to give the name, rank and serial  number and birth date and the like, but that does not prohibit  the U.S. government from questioning him about other things,"  said James Ross, senior legal adviser to the Human Rights Watch  activist group. "At the same time, they cannot use torture or  other unlawful means to get information."<p> 
			
							Amnesty International spokesman Alistair Hodgett said the  treaty did not prevent Saddam from facing trial on war crimes  and genocide charges. Hodgett said the Geneva Convention  allowed for POWs to be held until the end of hostilities, but  said that might be open to interpretation by U.S. authorities.<p> 
			
							Defense officials said the United States was holding about  13,000 prisoners in Iraq but did not say how many had been  given POW status.<p align="center">
