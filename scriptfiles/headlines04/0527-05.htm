TRENTON, N.J. --


 Drivers already paying $2 a gallon for gasoline are shelling out twice as much as they need to thanks to faulty environmental policies, an activist group charged Thursday. <p>Memorial Day weekend brings the start of the summer vacation season, and rising gas prices are going to make trips to the Shore or other getaway spots that much more expensive. <p>The statewide average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline was slightly over $2 on Thursday, the first time prices crossed that benchmark. <p>That's up 33 cents from a month ago, and nearly 60 cents more a gallon than on the Memorial Day weekend last year, according to AAA's Mid-Atlantic region. <p>But national and state leaders have ignored calls for laws that would mandate more fuel-efficient vehicles, environmental advocates said. If they had, drivers overall would pay less at the pump, a study by New Jersey Public Interest Research Group said. <p>In 1975, lawmakers acted, forcing auto manufacturers to increase fuel efficiency, said Dena Mottola, the group's director. <p>While not the only cause for high gas prices, getting more miles out of each gallon is something that can be done now to improve the situation, she said. <p>"There's no reason why we shouldn't, given the high price of gas and with no end in sight," Mottola said. <p>Cars average about 20 miles per gallon, but technology exists to push that average to 40 miles, Mottola claimed. By requiring the higher average, drivers would cut gas costs in half, she said. <p>Now is the time to get people thinking about cutting fuel use and seeking alternatives, she said. <p>"It's starting to seep into people's consciousness," Mottola said. "People are concerned about global warming and they know cars play a big role in that." <p>Drivers are more conscious of higher prices and ways to cut fuel costs, but most aren't changing habits yet, said Pam Maiolo, public affairs manager for the automobile association's mid-Atlantic region. <p>"With all that being said, there's still a heck of a lot of SUVs out there driving around," Maiolo said. <p>With higher prices, an average 800-mile driving vacation will cost about $20 more in gas, she said. That's enough for people to notice, but not high enough for them to stop driving, Maiolo said. <p>"People might if price continues to climb, alter their plans. They're not going to stop their plans for vacation travel," she said.
