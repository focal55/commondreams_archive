WASHINGTON - U.S. President George W. Bush's appearance on two Arab-language TV 
channels to talk about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners brought mixed 
response in Baghdad Wednesday. 
<P>

Bush vowed that those responsible for the "abhorrent" abuse of Iraqi 
prisoners will be "held to account" for their crimes.

Ayub Nuri of Global Radio News told CBC News that many Iraqis were 
skeptical of Bush's remarks. 
<P>

"They don't believe what President Bush says," he said. "They don't 
believe that the soldiers will be punished."
<P>

Sari Mouwaffaq, a mechanic, told the Associated Press that Bush's 
statements will "not restore the dignity which the tortured detainees 
lost. Bush's apology, or his attempt to find excuses, has no value to 
us." 
<P>

But Raad Youssef, a teacher, said he appreciated Bush's statements. 
<P>

"During Saddam, there were many genocides that were committed and nobody 
dared to reveal them at that time and now officials of the former regime 
did not try to apologize," he said. 
<P>

"Bush's attempt to repair the damage is a good thing in my opinion." 
<P>

Bush granted the brief interviews after the U.S. Army said criminal 
investigations were underway into the deaths of 14 prisoners in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and into 10 other cases of abuse. 
<P>

Washington has been reeling since photographs surfaced last week showing 
U.S. soldiers abusing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib 
prison in Baghdad. British officials are also investigating similar 
images. 
<P>

<b>Images will have 'terrible' effect on Iraqis: Bush</b> 
<P>

"People in Iraq must understand that I view those practices as 
abhorrent&#133; they also must understand that what took place in that 
prison does not represent the America that I know," Bush said. 
<P>

Bush conceded in one interview that the images will have a "terrible" 
effect on Iraqis and that people in the region will use them to remind 
people of their dislike for the U.S. 
<P>

Meanwhile, in Baghdad, anger over the abuse spilled into the streets on 
Wednesday. 
<P>

Protesters gathered outside the prison chanting "democracy doesn't mean 
killing innocent people" and "America and Israel are the enemies of 
God." 
<P>

The deaths of two Iraqi prisoners have already been ruled homicides. 
<P>

Six military police are facing criminal charges and seven officers have 
been disciplined by the U.S. military. 
<P>

In his interviews with the U.S.-sponsored al-Hurra television network 
and the Arab network al-Arabiya, Bush said the United States would hold 
itself up to the same standard of human rights it expects of others. 
<P>

"There will be investigations, people will be brought to justice," he 
said. 
<P>

Bush stopped short of specifically apologizing the for the mistreatment 
of the prisoners. But U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice 
told al-Arabiya that "we are deeply sorry for what happened to these 
people." 
<P>

Bush also said he has full confidence in Defence Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld and in the U.S. commanders on the ground in Iraq.
