LONDON  - The Red Cross saw U.S. troops keeping  Iraqi prisoners naked for days in darkness at the Abu Ghraib  jail in October, and was told by the intelligence officer in  charge it was "part of the process," a leaked report said on  Monday.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->The International Committee of the Red Cross also described  British troops forcing Iraqi detainees to kneel and stomping on  their necks in an incident in which one prisoner died.<p> 
			
			The Red Cross said it had repeatedly alerted U.S.-led  occupation authorities to practices it described as "serious  violations of international humanitarian law" and "in some  cases tantamount to torture."<p> 
			
			It confirmed the confidential February 4 report, which  appeared on the Wall Street Journal Web Site Monday, was  genuine.<p> 
			
			The 24-page report concluded that "persons deprived of  their liberty face the risk of being subjected to a process of  physical and psychological coercion, in some cases tantamount  to torture, in the early stages of the internment process."<p> 
			
			During a visit to Abu Ghraib in October, Red Cross  delegates witnessed "the practice of keeping persons deprived  of their liberty completely naked in totally empty concrete  cells and in total darkness," the report said.<p> 
			
			"Upon witnessing such cases, the ICRC interrupted its  visits and requested an explanation from the authorities. The  military intelligence officer in charge of the interrogation  explained that this practice was 'part of the process'."<p> 
			
			It said it met prisoners who were being held naked in  complete darkness. Others had been held naked and were allowed  to dress, but given only women's underwear.<p> 
			
			The Red Cross's visit took place two months before pictures  were taken of U.S. troops abusing prisoners, which later led to  criminal charges against seven soldiers.<p> 
			
			PICTURES<p> 
			
			Those pictures appeared in the media last month, causing  international outrage and prompting apologies by President Bush  and other senior officials. However, Washington has said it  believed the practices were isolated incidents of aberrant  behavior by individuals and not its usual practice.<p> 
			
			Although much of the abuse described in the report appears  to have taken place in jails run by U.S. forces, the report  also describes the death of an Iraqi prisoner in custody in the  British zone Basra last September. His name is blacked out.<p> 
			
			A spokesman for Britain's defense ministry said the  allegation was not new, but appeared to be a reference to the  death of an Iraqi detainee named Baha Musa, which Britain says  it has been investigating since last year.<p> 
			
			The Red Cross report described him as one of nine men  arrested in a Basra hotel and "made to kneel, face and hands  against the ground, as if in a prayer position. The soldiers  stamped on the back of the neck of those raising their head."<p> 
			
			It said the death certificate for the Iraqi prisoner listed  his cause of death as a heart attack.<p> 
			
			"An eyewitness description of the body given to the ICRC  mentioned a broken nose, several broken ribs and skin lesions  on the face consistent with beatings."<p> 
			
			The report describes prison guards opening fire with live  ammunition during riots and escape attempts, on detainees who  "were unarmed and did not appear to pose any serious threat to  anyone's life."<p> 
			
			According to the report, the Red Cross repeatedly drew  allegations of mistreatment to the attention of the  authorities. In some cases, they changed practices. For  example, they stopped issuing wristbands marked "terrorist" to  all foreign detainees.<p> 
			
			Among the "serious violations of international humanitarian  law," the report listed a failure to set up a system to notify  family members of arrests.<p> 
			
			"The uncaring behavior of the CF (Coalition Forces) and  their inability to quickly provide accurate information on  persons deprived of their liberty for the families concerned  also seriously affects the image of the Occupying Powers among  the Iraqi population," it said.
