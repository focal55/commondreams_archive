<p>NEW DELHI  - Italian-born Sonia Gandhi dropped out  of the race to become India's prime minister on Tuesday to end  debate over her foreign birth, opening the way for her Congress  party to choose an economic reformer as its leader.<p>

"I must humbly decline this post," she told an uproarious  meeting of lawmakers from her Congress party.<p> 
			
			Fighting to make herself heard above indignant shouts from  her supporters, she said: "I request you to accept my decision  and to recognize that I will not reverse it.<p> 
			
			"It is my inner voice, my conscience," said Gandhi,  57-year-old widow of murdered former prime minister Rajiv  Gandhi.<p> 
			
			She gave no immediate public signal as to who she wished to  head the new government. But the NDTV network said Gandhi was  pushing former finance minister Manmohan Singh, the architect  of India's economic reforms.<p> 
			
			The withdrawal by the heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty --  India's equivalent of America's Kennedys -- had earlier  triggered anguished scenes outside her New Delhi home as  hundreds of supporters rallied to press her to change her mind.<p> 
			
			One man stood on the roof of a car, held a home-made gun to  his head and waved a stick to deter people trying to calm him.<p> 
			
			"Call Sonia Gandhi! Tell her I will kill myself if she  doesn't become prime minister!" he said before being disarmed.<p> 
			
			Others lay down in the street or torched effigies of  Gandhi's Hindu nationalist opponents, who have run a bitter  campaign targeting her Italian background after their  humiliating election loss last week.<p> 
			
			"Congress has informed us that Mrs Gandhi will no longer be  leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, and they are  meeting to elect a new leader," said Sitaram Yechuri, a leader  of the main Communist Party of India (Marxist), which has  pledged its support to a Congress coalition government.<p> 
			
			LAWMAKERS MEET<p> 
			
			Congress leaders had made frantic last minute efforts to  persuade Gandhi to stay on and become India's first foreign  born prime minister and the fourth from the Nehru-Gandhi clan.<p> 
			
			Her withdrawal, and the prospect of Singh leading Asia's  third-largest economy, spurred markets, helping stocks on the  Bombay exchange post their second-biggest daily rally just a  day after the worst plunge in the exchange's 129-year history.<p> 
			
			At Gandhi's residence, Congress leaders, some beating their  chests, urged her to ignore what they called the ousted  Bharatiya Janata Party's "racist" campaign.<p> 
			
			"She feels the country comes first, she does not want the  country to be faced with this," said Congress official Salman  Khursheed. "We are stunned, it is shocking, I just can't see  the Congress party accepting such an outcome."<p> 
			
			Left-wing parties, with more than 60 seats, were supporting  Gandhi without formally joining her coalition, but have spooked  markets with anti-privatization comments.<p> 
			
			As news of Gandhi's possible withdrawal filtered out, the  stock market rebounded sharply and recorded one of its biggest  gains.<p> 
			
			"The market has gone up because of news that Sonia is  reluctant to be PM," said Bharat Shah, director of Vikram Kenia  Securities. "This means that Manmohan Singh, who is very  reformist, will become prime minister."<p> 
			
			Gandhi, an Indian citizen, and Singh met President Abdul  Kalam earlier Tuesday to open talks about forming government.  Gandhi said later she would meet Kalam again on Wednesday.
			<p> 
			
			Kalam had invited Gandhi to meet him as leader of the  biggest party in the new parliament, and is likely to accept  Congress' claim to power in the world's largest democracy.
