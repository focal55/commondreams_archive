<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> MIAMI -  Bongo drums, rapping preachers and a smattering of all-too-familiar technical difficulties greeted Florida voters yesterday as the state's first attempt at early voting in a presidential election opened the 16-day voting season in this critical, closely contested state.

<p>Florida is one of more than two dozen states that allow residents to vote at the polls before Election Day, and one of four that began the process yesterday. Texas, Colorado and Arkansas also began early voting yesterday. Several other key states already have begun early voting, including Iowa, Nevada and New Mexico.

<p>Early voters crowded precincts across Florida, but long waits in Miami-Dade County, computer glitches in Broward County around Fort Lauderdale and other problems cropped up, raising concerns for the Nov. 2 presidential election.

<p>The last thing Florida elections officials want is a replay of the 2000 presidential-election disaster, when ballot challenges and court fights left the election unresolved for 36 days, until the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the state's recount halted and George W. Bush was declared the winner.

<p>In Broward, long delays and massive confusion marred the start of early voting as the remote system at nine polling sites collapsed, making it impossible to electronically confirm voters' eligibility. Workers instead used paper lists and called the election supervisor's office.

<p>By about 10:30 a.m., two hours after polls were scheduled to open, 20 to 30 people had left Hallandale Beach City Hall without voting, city officials said.

<p>Voters cast their ballots electronically in a downtown Miami government building yesterday as Florida began its early voting program.
"I've never seen anything like this in my life," said Marjorie Jacobs, 90, of Hallandale Beach, who went home after waiting 2½ hours in vain. "I'm coming back and voting on Election Day."

<p>Miami-Dade elections officials reported no significant problems as thousands of people reported to 20 polling sites, but isolated waits of more than three hours forced some people to give up.

<p>Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes said the county's electronic voting machines worked fine and there was no connection between the malfunction and the machines.

<p>"The meltdown was these laptops," which poll workers were using to verify voter registration, Snipes said.

<p>Computerized verification was restored at most of the polling places by mid-afternoon, although clerks at Oakland Park had to verify voters by phone until nearly 6 p.m.

<p>In Palm Beach County, the focal point of the infamous 2000 presidential recount, State Rep. Shelley Vana, a Democrat, was the seventh person in line at an early-voting site. She said the paper absentee ballot she received was missing one of its two pages, including the proposed amendments to the state constitution. She said election workers were indifferent when she pointed out the oversight, The Associated Press reported.

<p>Early voting, introduced in Florida after the 2000 election, gives voters 15 days to cast ballots at any of a variety of locations in their home counties.

<p>With Florida considered a key state for the presidential election, both parties are making a huge push to capture every vote, especially through early voting.

<p>Toward that end, hundreds of people — many associated with Democratic-leaning labor, community and activist groups — gathered at a festive "Early Voting Counts" rally at the Miami-Dade Government Center.

<p>They cheered and clapped to "early vote" messages from rappers and a thundering speech from the Rev. Al Sharpton, a former presidential candidate.

<p>"We've come to solve the crime by returning to the scene of the crime!" Sharpton boomed, referring to the hotly contested 2000 elections.

<p>Florida Secretary of State Glenda Hood announced yesterday that two to four early-voting sites will be added in Jacksonville, where demonstrators had gathered outside the elections supervisor's office to protest a decision to limit sprawling Duval County, with its large numbers of African-American voters, to a single early-voting location.

<p>In Jacksonville, turnout was somewhat lower than expected. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown led rallies but came nowhere near their goal of delivering 1,000 voters.

<p>Sonia Bethel, 43, the first person through Miami's Government Center line, was voting for the first time since becoming a U.S. citizen. A Bahamas native, the nursing-home assistant and mother of eight said she arrived at 8 a.m. so she could be first.

<p>At about 12:40 p.m., poll workers had handed out 324 voting tickets, but only 109 people had actually voted.

<p>Poll workers had only four laptop computers to verify voter registration. And people were taking more than 10 minutes to finish the complicated ballots, which also contain eight state constitutional amendments and eight general-obligation bond questions.

<p>In most Miami-Dade precincts, voters also were upset that voting machines sat empty while the lines grew longer.

<p>Seth Kaplan, spokesman for Miami-Dade elections, said there are 100 different ballots in the county — which encompasses many separate localities — for this election, but each voting machine holds only one-third of them. Some machines are used more than others, depending on the voters, he said.

<p>"It's something we'd like to improve in the future but that won't affect the election," he said.

<p>At least this time, the dead will be able to vote legally. Miami-Dade election officials said yesterday the vote of anyone who dies between the time they cast an early ballot and Nov. 2 will still be counted.

<p><b>Court: Provisional ballots must be at right precincts
</b>
<p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -  People who cast provisional ballots at the wrong precinct are not entitled to have their votes counted, the Florida Supreme Court ruled yesterday, rejecting an argument by labor unions that the rule wrongly disenfranchises voters.

<p>In a unanimous ruling, the court said the law clearly states that provisional ballots must be counted only if the person was entitled to vote "at the precinct," and that the constitution gives the Legislature the authority to dictate voting rules.

<p>Under Florida law, if voters show up at a polling place but officials there have no record that they are registered, they are given provisional ballots. Those ballots are held until officials determine whether the voters were entitled to vote at that precinct and had not already cast ballots. If they should have been allowed to vote at that precinct, the ballots count; if not, they are thrown out.

<p>A group of labor unions sued over the ballot law, saying it unconstitutionally disenfranchised voters who may not know their polling place. They argued that many people have new polling places because of redistricting, may have moved, or may have been displaced by a hurricane. The court disagreed, saying that requiring provisional voters vote at the correct precincts is no more unreasonable than requiring everyone else to vote at the right polling places.
