LONDON - Iraq could be heading for a far worse situation in 
weeks ahead, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) 
warns in its annual report published Tuesday.
<p>
                  
   The IISS, one of the world's leading institutions for strategic 
relations, paints a bleak picture for Iraq and for the United States in 
Iraq.

Leading decision-makers are expected to take close note of IISS 
projections. The institute was correct last year in its assessment of the 
consequences of the invasion of Iraq. 
<p>
   ”Our conclusions turned out to be accurate because we did not have 
access to intelligence,” Gary Samore, director of studies at the IISS 
told media representatives at the launch of the report.
<p>
   The United States occupation forces are under threat from Iraqis 
themselves, not primarily from al-Qaeda, the report says.
<p>
   Al-Qaeda could have up to 18,000 militants under its wing, the IISS 
says. It does not source the estimate, or indicate where they might be or 
in what state of readiness. But al-Qaeda is not the issue in Iraq, as 
U.S. officials have been suggesting, the report says.
<p>
   ”The efficiency of the attacks, their regularity and the speed with 
which they were organized in the aftermath of Saddam's fall point to 
predominantly Iraqi involvement,” the report says. 
<p>
   ”The shadowy organization behind these sectarian attacks is likely to 
be a hybrid, with elements of the old regime acting in alliance 
with 'industrial scale' criminal gangs operating in the urban centers of 
Basra, Baghdad and Mosul; indigenous Islamic radicals, and a relatively 
small number of foreign fighters,” it says.
<p>
   ”It is unlikely that there has been a 'hidden hand' centrally 
coordinating and funding the insurgency,” the report adds. ”While foreign 
jihadists appear to be a comparatively minor source of anti-coalition 
violence in Iraq, Iraqi Islamists - both Sunni and Shia - are major 
sources.” 
<p>
   By November last year the U.S. forces had detained 250 foreigners, of 
whom only 19 were thought ”probable” al-Qaeda fighters.
<p>
   The report suggests that the Americans are a largely clueless lot in 
Iraq. ”The lack of solid intelligence on the U.S. side means that 
American forces have only a partial understanding of who is attacking 
them,” the report says. And operations such as Operation Peninsula 
Strike, Operation Sidewinder and Operation Soda Mountain have 
only ”perversely inspired insurgent violence,” the report says.
<p>
   The Americans have brought trouble on themselves in a variety of other 
ways, the report says.
<p>
   Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) administrator Paul Bremer's 
decision to dissolve the Iraqi army a year ago ”provided impetus to the 
coalescence of the insurgency.” The occupation tactics of heavily armed 
motorized patrols and large fortified bases ”framed a target by making 
the foreign military presence detached and largely remote from the Iraqi 
population.”
<p>
   And as the daily toll of U.S. casualties mounted, ”American forces 
were increasingly perceived as weak and their presence in and commitment 
to the country as temporary.” Subsequently, loyalists from Saddam 
Hussein's Ba'ath Party and remnants from his security forces ”began 
launching hit-and-run tactics with increasing frequency and skill.”
<p>
   The summer of last year witnessed 10-15 attacks a day. By autumn that 
rose to 20-35 daily and the attacks became ”better organized and more 
sophisticated.” What did not change was the CPA's ”relatively little 
knowledge about the country they are trying to control” in part because 
of a dearth of Arabic speakers on CPA staff.
<p>
   But the most important task has yet to begin in which Iraqis 
could ”see state institutions making a direct and positive impact on 
their everyday lives.” The decision to hand over power to Iraqis June 30 
is ”risky at the very least,” the report says. The exile-dominated 
governing council is ”detached from the very people it is meant to 
represent.”
<p>
   The report warns that ”the gap between the political structures left 
by the departing CPA and the population itself does not bode well for the 
vanquishing of the insurgency or the growth of democracy.”
<p>
   Col. Christopher Langton, editor of the Military Balance published by 
the IISS told media representatives at the launch that even in military 
terms the coalition forces are not up to the job. 
<p>
   The coalition forces needed about 500,000 troops to handle the post-
conflict situation in Iraq ”to bring short to medium term stability to 
the country.” There are present only around 150,000.
<p>
   He said also that U.S. forces are not used to policing duties, though 
British troops are ”as a result of bitter post-colonial experiences”.
<p>
   Beyond Iraq, the situation in the country is a problem for the future 
of the United States itself, the IISS report says.
<p>
   ”If the U.S. is seen to fail in Iraq, America's foreign policy will 
have to be rethought,” it says. ”The long-term instability of Iraq would 
act as a potent symbol, highlighting the limited power of the U.S. to 
intervene successfully against rogue states.”
<p>
   The present U.S. doctrine and regime change in Iraq is in any 
case ”set to have major political and legal repercussions with respect to 
standards of international intervention and, more broadly, sovereignty in 
the developing world,” the report says. 
<p>
   And if the domestic situation in Iraq does not stabilize, ”violence 
and unrest could spread over Iraq's long and porous borders”.
<p>
   IISS director John Chipman told media representatives that ”problems 
with both security and politics set to continue and even increase in the 
six weeks to 'hand over' and then the six months to the proposed date for 
national elections.”
<p>
   There seems to be little chance in the immediate future that ”the 
security vacuum that has dominated Iraq since liberation can be filled by 
either coalition troops or by the nascent military and police forces 
hastily stood up since liberation.” These forces have so far either 
refused to act against insurgents, or joined them, Chipman said.
<p>
   Chipman quoted British diplomat Harold Nicolson as saying once that 
though you cannot acquire prestige without power, you cannot retain 
prestige without reputation. ”The U.S. today is finding it difficult to 
balance the exercise of its power with the retention of its prestige,” 
Chipman said. 
<p>
   ”The present U.S. administration is becoming acutely aware of the fact 
that reputation, prestige and power can easily be squandered through 
mismanaged interventions and peacekeeping operations,” he said. ”The next 
six weeks and six months will test U.S. and coalition power - and 

reputation - substantially.”
