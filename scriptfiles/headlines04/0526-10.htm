Women arriving in New York this summer will bring pom-poms and panties along with their political posters when they protest the Republican National Convention.<p>
Hoping to add wit and femininity to the traditionally male-dominated protest scene will be <a href="http://www.axisofeve.org/">Axis of Eve</a>, whose members flash their underwear as a form of protest and the <a href="http://www.radicalcheer.org/home.htm">Radical Cheerleaders</a>, a short-skirt-clad political pep club that practices "activism with pom-poms and middle fingers extended."

      Axis of Eve is proud to have waved their panty flags at the March for Women's Lives in Washington D.C. on April 25th -- the LARGEST EVER (official count: 1,150,000) Women's Rights Rally in history<br>

The women's groups from across the country that are spending the summer organizing political Pantyware, rather than Tupperware, parties and fashioning pom-poms from tablecloths in preparation for RNC rabble-rousing have come a long way from their less choreographed bra-waving forbears of the 1960s women's rights movement. Besides skits, songs and role-playing, some of the groups use their sexuality to deliver political messages.
<p>
Axis of Eve members, for example, with their skimpy panties emblazoned with racy political logos such as "Weapon of Mass Seduction," are a far cry from stereotypical burly union and bearded hippy protesters.<p>
"As women, our bodies can often be used against us to objectify us ...  but we're trying to be fun and disarm people through humor and get women involved," said a 33-year-old women's studies professor from Brooklyn who calls herself "Eden Eve."<p>
Many of the groups will gather tonight at White Box, a gallery at 525 W. 26th St. in Manhattan, for "Majority Whipped," a dress rehearsal for the convention.<p>
While the groups, which all welcome men, promote a feminist agenda, such as supporting abortion rights and fighting sexism, they also protest everything from the GOP's environmental policy and members' refusal to fund stem-cell therapy.<p>
It's all a part of what they call "creative resistance," a tactic they say is more appealing than waving posters and chanting.<p>
One Manhattan band dons oversized bras and red-white-and-blue wigs and straps toy missiles to their bodies. Songs include "Show us the Way to the Next Oil Field" and "Shop in the Name of War."<p>
Women performers, some of whom use slogans laden with sexual innuendos, said they know they risk not being taken seriously or turning off observers.<p>
"This is sort of the level that our frustration has led to," said a band member who identifies herself as Dolly Daily Bombing. "We're at the end of being able to be respected in society as activists."<p>
Charlotte Koons, an organizer of Code Pink's Long Island chapter, said her group uses gimmicks that won't overwhelm its audience.<p>
To protest sales of gas-guzzling Hummers, for example, the group held a "hum-in," where members hummed outside congressional offices.<p>
"You have to break through to people's apathy and have to engage them," said Koons, of Northport, "because this culture has made us demonically short attention-spanned."
