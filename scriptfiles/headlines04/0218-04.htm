<p>MADRID  - The U.S. commander in Iraq, in an
interview published on Wednesday, said he sees American troops
staying for years, and helping Iraqis maintain order in Baghdad
for at least the coming 12 months.

<!--/endimage/-->"I would say we're talking about years, not months,"
Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez told Spanish newspaper El
Pais when asked how long the U.S. army would remain in Iraq.
<p>
 "The Iraqis tell us they don't want us here, but nor do
they want us to go. It's very complicated," he said.
<p>
 Asked about Baghdad, where U.S. troops are moving to the
outskirts to help ease newly trained Iraqi police and soldiers
into their eventual role as the capital's guardians, Sanchez
said tactical control remained firmly in the coalition's hands.
<p>
 "The only thing that is changing is that we are giving
Iraqi police officers and Civil Defense Corps soldiers a little
bit more responsibility and they are starting to operate more
freely," he was quoted as saying.
<p>
 "But (the Iraqi forces) continue to operate under the
tactical control of the coalition forces. It's not a case of us
leaving town and leaving them on their own."
<p>
 Sanchez said U.S. troops on the outskirts of Baghdad would
coordinate with the Iraqis and send them rapid reaction forces
to help out in case of problems.
<p>
 "This (arrangement) will stay in place for at least the
next year," he said.
<p>
 U.S. forces have this month started scaling down their
presence inside Baghdad with the arrival of fresh troops who
are mostly moving into bases on the city's outskirts.
<p>
 The arriving 1st Cavalry Division is moving into eight
bases around Baghdad, with one in the center. That compares
with 26 bases in the city prior to their arrival, and down from
as many as 60 last summer just after the Iraq war.
<p>
 Besides handing more authority to the Iraqi forces, the
United States has said it wants its presence to be less of an
impediment to daily life in a congested city.
