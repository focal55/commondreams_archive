WASHINGTON - Twenty-five prisoners have died  while being held by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and two  of them were murdered in Iraq by Americans, U.S. Army officials  said on Tuesday.
<p> 
			
			An Army official said one soldier was convicted of murder  in the U.S. military justice system for shooting a prisoner to  death in September 2003 at a detention center in Iraq, and  another prisoner was killed at the Abu Ghraib jail near Baghdad  in November 2003 by a private contractor who worked as an  interrogator for the CIA.<p> 
			
			The soldier was reduced in rank to private and thrown out  of the service but did not serve any jail time, the official  said. The official said the soldier shot the prisoner after the  prisoner had thrown rocks at the soldier, and the soldier was  found to have used excessive force.<p> 
			
			The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  because the CIA contractor was not in the U.S. military no  legal action was taken because of lack of jurisdiction, but  Army officials referred the case to the Justice Department for  possible action. The official did not offer details of this  killing.
<p> 
			
			The official did not identify the Americans involved in the  murders or the victims. Most of the deaths took place in Iraq.
<p> 
			
			Word of these investigations came as the Pentagon  investigated the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. forces at the  Abu Ghraib jail outside Baghdad, which has inflamed  anti-American sentiment, especially in the Arab world.<p> 
			
			The official said a third death among the 25 being  investigated was ruled a justifiable homicide, saying it  occurred while a prisoner was attempting to escape.<p> 
			
			Of the other 22 death investigations involving prisoners in  Iraq and Afghanistan, 12 prisoners were found to have died  either by natural or undetermined causes and a further 10  deaths were still being investigated. The Army did not say in  which countries the 25 killings occurred but said the vast  majority were in Iraq not Afghanistan.
<p> 
			
			In addition, the official said another 10 abuse cases are  being investigated, nine involving allegations of assault and  one involving allegations of sexual assault.
