<p>The Red Cross says it has serious concerns about the plight of civilians in the Iraqi city of Falluja. 
<p>It has called for an independent assessment of conditions in Falluja, where there is still no electricity or tap water.
<p>Iraqi and US authorities, back in charge of much of the city, have played down warnings of a humanitarian crisis.

Meanwhile bomb blasts killed at least four people in Baghdad and Kirkuk, as violence continued across the country.
<p><ul>
<li>In western Baghdad, a car bomb explodes outside a police station, killing two people and injuring at least four, police say
<p><li>Two Iraqis are killed by an explosion in the rush hour near a recruitment centre in the northern city of Kirkuk
<p><li>Rebels fire mortars at government offices
in Mosul, where US troops are trying to put down an uprising by insurgents
</ul>
<p><b>Fight to the death</b>
<p>Conditions in Falluja are said to be desperate, after months in which militants held the city, and the US first bombarded what it called rebel positions, then invaded.
<p>An ICRC spokesman told BBC News that Falluja's main hospital, on the outskirts of the city, had been freshly stocked with medical equipment, but that wounded people could not get there.
<p>"The first concern we have is over the safety of the people in Falluja," Ahmed Rawi said.
<p>"We simply cannot enter the city under such ferocious fighting."
<p>He said the ICRC was negotiating with US forces to open a "humanitarian corridor" into the city.
<p>The BBC's Jennifer Glasse, with US marines in Falluja, says tough battles are still being fought in the city's  southern neighbourhoods.
<p>She says marines are calling in aerial bombing raids to hit houses where insurgents are holed up, refusing to surrender.
<p>The marines' commander says at least 55 insurgents were killed on Wednesday.
<p>In nearby Ramadi, US forces were said to have fought a three-hour gun battle overnight, in which at least seven people were reported killed.
<p>Several people were killed in a day of violence across Iraq on Wednesday, including at least 14 Iraqis who died in a suicide bombing in the town of Baiji, north of Baghdad.
<p>The supreme leader of neighbouring Iran, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei, on Thursday  condemned "the massacre of civilians, women and children... the execution of wounded, the destruction of homes [and] mosques" by "infidels" in Falluja.
<p>Meanwhile, a mutilated woman's body found in Falluja on Sunday has been flown out of Iraq for DNA tests to see if it is that of kidnapped aid worker Margaret Hassan.
