      An unlikely win by the Democrat John Kerry would be a line in the sand, 
      a chance to put aside the debilitating blame game over the mess that Iraq 
      has become. Instead, the US in a second Bush term will have to soldier on, 
      with much of the world continuing to refuse the meaningful assistance that 
      might dig the President out of a hole he dug for himself.
<p>A win is a win is a win. But as a referendum on Iraq and the war on terror, 
        Bush's margin in the popular vote is narrow, particularly when compared 
        to the levels of support he enjoyed in the days after September 11.</p>
      <p>That will not stop Bush and the neo-conservatives claiming vindication 
        - and probably it will fuel even more zealous efforts to shape outcomes 
        according to their unilateralist, America-knows-best view of a terror-stressed 
        world.</p>
      <div id="adSpotIsland" class="islandad"></div>
      <p>The massive explosives theft in Iraq, the bulk of which may be in the 
        hands of insurgents and terrorists now; and of the revelation by Bush's 
        Christian supporter Pat Robertson that the President had predicted before 
        the Iraq invasion that he would not lose a single American life, had me 
        thinking Kerry might fall over the line.</p>
      <p>That went out the window when Osama bin Laden voted for the enemy he 
        wants - President Bush - with his very deliberate and calculated intervention 
        in the campaign. On the strength of Bush's claim of victory last night, 
        Fallujah needs to brace itself; Tehran should tread carefully.</p>
      <p>Iraq is the intractable problem we know - and Bush is likely to authorise 
        a full-scale US attack on insurgents holding Fallujah in a matter of days. 
        But imposing a secure environment in Iraq will remain fraught - a well-organised, 
        mobile, funded and equipped network is in place and, the planned assault 
        on Fallujah notwithstanding, elections scheduled for January are unlikely 
        to proceed.</p>
      <p>Tehran's nuclear ambition and how Washington and Israel deal with it 
        is the next crisis we face. The Iranian view seems to be that their program 
        is sufficiently advanced for them to be deemed to be a nuclear power, 
        even though weapons are estimated to be years off.</p>
      <p>Bush has so damaged US credibility that the most powerful nation in the 
        world is the most hated. Despite European efforts to keep Iran in a diplomatic 
        channel, brinkmanship will likely drive the issue to a US push for sanctions.</p>
      <p>Rallying support for sanctions against Iran will be difficult, and the 
        likelihood is that the US will take a leaf out of Israel's book - in 1981 
        Israel bombed a single reactor in Iraq.</p>
      <p>The Iranian program has as many as 40 key sites, making it a complex 
        target. Despite that, strike plans are being discussed within the Bush 
        Administration and egged on by Israel. The only option for Washington 
        will be a resort to the policy that got it into so much trouble in Iraq 
        - a pre-emptive military strike and all its negative implications for 
        the US in the Muslim world.</p>
      <p>In the meantime Osama bin Laden, the man that <em>New York Post</em> 
        headlines refers to as "Rat", is presumed to be in the mountains that 
        straddle the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, having signalled so clearly 
        to the world last week that while the US is bogged down in Iraq, the No.1 
        bogyman in the war on terror is alive and well.</p>
      <p>Bush's adviser Karen Hughes said a re-elected Bush would work hard as 
        a president for all Americans. Judging on his performance in the last 
        four years, that means another difficult term in international affairs.</p>
      <p>If the Bush claim of victory holds, it means the so-called leader of 
        the Western world will continue in his role as ventriloquist's doll for 
        a neoconservative band that will claim on the strength of the popular 
        vote that they should be allowed to slip the leash.</p>
