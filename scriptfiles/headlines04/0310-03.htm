Hoping to borrow some limelight from the Democratic National Convention and draw attention to liberal issues, two city councilors, community groups, and a local activist are planning a three-day forum for protesters, academics, and religious organizations the weekend before the convention.</p>
  <p>
The <a href="http://www.bostonsocialforum.org/index.php" target="_new">Boston Social Forum</a>, a three-day series of workshops, cultural events, and meetings is expected to attract some 3,000 people, said City Councilor Chuck Turner and Councilor at Large Felix D. Arroyo, who plan to ask the city to sanction the event with a measure at today's council meeting.</p>
<p>
Set to be staged at the University of Massachusetts at Boston from July 23 to 25, the nonpartisan forum is meant to give activists a voice as Democrats converge on Boston, organizers said.</p>
  <p>
     It's also an alternative to protesting downtown or near the FleetCenter, said Jason Pramas, the forum's coordinator.</p>
  <p>
     &quot;For most folks, being an engaged citizen means voting, but in this day and age, that's just not enough,&quot; Pramas said, noting that the forum will deal with global and local issues. &quot;Boston cannot possibly talk about being a world-class city when growing numbers of people here can't find decent long-term jobs with living wages and benefits.&quot;</p>
  <p>
     More than 50 community groups are pitching in to coordinate the event, which features political figures Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn.</p>
  <p>
     Affiliated with World Social Forums that have drawn mass crowds for similar events in cities worldwide, the Boston event would be the first of its kind in North America, Pramas said. Another forum is being planned during the Republican National Convention in New York.</p>
  <p>
     Turner said he had hoped the DNC could be more of a social forum, but ultimately he believes it will be nothing but &quot;politics as usual,&quot; and &quot;an oportunity to plan their strategy for winning the presidency.&quot;</p>
  <p>
     Arroyo faulted the convention for having a limited agenda and failing to include more minorities and community groups in the planning process. He said a grass-roots forum for political networking and exhange of ideas was necessary to balance the convention. &quot;We must have an agenda of inclusion,&quot; Arroyo said. &quot;There are human beings left out of the political process.&quot;</p>
