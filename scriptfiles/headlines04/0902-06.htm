<p>INEW YORK  - As George W Bush prepares to formally accept the 
presidential nomination from his Republican Party in New York City while 
protesters gather outside a midtown arena, it seems that the polarization 
of politics in the United States is hitting its zenith.
<p>
					  
					  
The protests, which have continued all this week, swelled to hundreds of 
thousands last Sunday, with the huge U.S. troop presence in Iraq a focal 
point of demonstrators' anger at the administration. That opposition also 
raised the question of whether Democratic contender John Kerry's backing 
for the war will cost him a significant number of votes.
<p>
The four-day convention itself seemed to many like it was taking place on 
another planet, with unprecedented security ensuring that delegates were 
vacuum-sealed away from the boisterous crowds outside, and speakers like 
former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani exhorting the party faithful: 
”Thank God for President Bush!”
<p>
The race is one of the most closely fought in recent memory, with polls 
showing at most a one or two-point spread between Bush and Kerry.
<p>
It is the tiny percentage of non-decided voters that the candidates are 
hoping to win over, the majority of them in what have been dubbed ”swing 
states” -- any state where the margin of victory between Democrats and 
Republicans was less than 10 percent in the last election.
<p>
The latest surveys show that slightly more than half of Americans believe 
that Iraq was ”not worth going to war over”, and 58 percent say that Bush 
lacks a clear exit strategy. A tiny margin trusts Kerry over Bush on the 
issue of Iraq, but the reverse was true when respondents were asked to 
weigh the candidates on the ”war on terror,” with 48 to 45 percent saying 
Bush would do a better job.
<p>
However, some argue that these numbers fail to reflect a large number of 
people who profoundly oppose the war and may opt for an independent 
candidate like Ralph Nader, who won three million votes in the 2000 
election and says he would withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq.
<p>
”I personally know scores of people -- including those in swing states -- 
who say they will not under any circumstances vote for Kerry unless and 
until he comes out against the war,” said <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0423-13.htm">Stephen Zunes</a>, chair of the Peace 
and Justice Studies Program at the University of San Francisco.
<p>
”Furthermore, Kerry's strident support for rightist Israeli Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon's colonization and annexation schemes in the West Bank, his 
recent denunciation of the International Court of Justice, and his support 
for continued large-scale arms transfers to human rights violators show 
that his support for Bush's invasion of Iraq was no aberration.”
<p>
”His embrace of such a right-wing militarist agenda has so alienated the 
Democratic Party base that it could very well cost him the election,” Zunes 
added.
<p>
Kerry has accused Bush of misleading Congress and the nation in his push to 
invade Iraq, but also insists he does not regret his Senate vote 
authorizing the president to go to war. He says that if elected he would 
seek to broaden international support for the occupation of Iraq, for 
example by bringing in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but 
would not withdraw from the nation.
<p>
But while a few anti-war voters will inevitably be alienated by Kerry's 
positions, some observers believe that the desire to get Bush out of office 
will end up trumping any distaste for the Democratic candidate when people 
go the polls Nov 2.
<p>
”My hope is that those backing Kerry will not switch to Bush because of 
Kerry's position on the war in Iraq,” said <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0830-09.htm">Chris Brauchli</a>, a Colorado 
lawyer and columnist. ”The war in Iraq will come to an end but Bush's 
legacy, if re-elected, will outlast the lifetimes of many of us in ways too 
numerous to mention.”
<p>
The Republican leadership has taken great pains to present a moderate face 
at their convention, inviting speakers who support such issues as gay 
rights and the right to an abortion -- although the platform adopted on the 
first day repeated calls for a constitutional amendment banning gay 
marriage, and Bush has strongly favored policies embraced by conservative 
Christians, like ”abstinence education” in schools.
<p>
These issues, as much as the war, may be a deciding factor in who emerges 
victorious from the polls, some say.
<p>
”The reinscription and deepening of the religious right into the heart of 
American politics is as critical to reject as Kerry's foreign policy. It is 
also a greater immediate reality for many than the war, and people are 
finally, I think, connecting the dots between the two,” said <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0827-05.htm">Ananya 
Mukherjee Reed</a>, a political science professor at York College in Toronto, 
Canada.
<p>
”I think immigrants, people of color, women, Arab-Americans or other 
Muslim Americans might feel that Kerry would at least not continue the kind 
of desecularization of the state and politics that the Bush administration 
has unleashed,” she added.
<p>
Still, some believe that Kerry will making a major tactical error if he 
takes the anti-Bush vote for granted, and expressed particular 
disappointment that the Democratic contender is distancing himself from his 
opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
<p>
By avidly pursuing a small number of voters in the political center, Kerry 
risks low voter turnout among progressives who have become disenchanted 
with the two-party system, says <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0830-06.htm">Roger Smith</a>, who teaches journalism at 
Ithaca College in New York.
<p>
”The larger issue is that the Democratic Party has never, in its whole 
history, allowed the American public a referendum on an ongoing war by 
nominating an anti-war candidate,” said Smith.
<p>
”That's a very bracing comment on the level of democracy we have in the 
United States. Could Kerry be the first? Sure he could, if he had the 
courage. But he seems to have boxed himself in.”</p>
