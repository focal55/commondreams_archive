BAGHDAD  - Iraqis accuse U.S. troops of stealing  money and other property during what they say are aggressive  and even destructive American raids on homes that can devastate  families socially and financially.
<p> 
			
			"It's a huge problem. Almost everyone has something to say  about gold, money and other valuables going missing and they  don't believe they'll ever get them back," said Adel Alami, a  lawyer with Iraq's Human Rights Organization.<p> 
			
			Over the past 14 months of occupation, U.S. forces have  carried out thousands of raids on homes across the country in  which money, jewelry and other property have been seized from  Iraqis suspected of "anti-coalition activities."<p> 
			
			The U.S. military says items are generally confiscated on  suspicion they could be used to finance attacks against  U.S.-led forces, and that this has led to some success in  cutting off funding for guerrillas.<p> 
			
			A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said he was aware of  Iraqi complaints of theft during raids and that some U.S.  soldiers had been disciplined for "inappropriate conduct." But  he said the problem was "very rare, extremely rare."<p> 
			
			"We're aware of it ... But there's also the possibility of  Iraqis making malicious claims," said the spokesman.<p> 
			
			CONFISCATED ITEMS<p> 
			
			He said a receipt was always given for confiscated items  and if the owner was eventually found to be innocent they could  get the property back.<p> 
			
			But many Iraqis who have had items confiscated say no  receipts were provided.<p> 
			
			They say the raids often target the wrong people and that  lifetime savings, precious jewelry and family heirlooms are  regularly stolen in the process.<p> 
			
			Alami says the majority of cases his group deals with  involve Iraqis seeking compensation for lost property and cash.<p> 
			
			Last year, Wajiha Daoud, an 80-year-old widow, had her  house in a middle-class neighborhood of Baghdad raided by U.S.  troops who said they had "high-level intelligence" that the  home was a safe house for Saddam Hussein loyalists.<p> 
			
			During the raid, which lasted around 30 minutes, the woman  and her family, who live across the street, were kept outside.<p> 
			
			"When we went back in, the house was half-destroyed," said  her son Musadaq Younis, an English-speaking computer  technician.<p> 
			
			"All the furniture was slashed with knives, tables and  chairs were broken and the windows smashed. They didn't need to  break down the front door -- I told them I had the key."<p> 
			
			But that was not the worst. When Younis' sister arrived she  immediately rushed upstairs to a small cabinet and found it  empty -- $5,000 in cash, gold and other jewelry, including her  wedding ring, were missing. "She went white," said Younis.<p> 
			
			COMPLEX PROCESS<p> 
			
			The family filed a claim against the U.S. military -- a  complex process that took nearly three months to get a reply.  In response, the military said the raid was justified and no  compensation was owed. The officer who commanded the raid told  Younis: "My soldiers aren't thieves."<p> 
			
			Being comfortably well off and employed the impact of the  loss on the family was not too great, but for other Iraqi  families raids on their homes can prove devastating.<p> 
			
			"Confiscation and theft during raids is rampant," said  Stewart Vriesinga, a coordinator for Christian Peacemaker  Teams, a non-profit group that documents abuses in Iraq.<p> 
			
			"Soldiers don't seem to understand the Iraqi custom of not  using banks -- a lot of people keep fairly substantial sums of  money at home," Vriesinga said.<p> 
			
			"A soldier from Kentucky or wherever sees that and thinks  the person must be up to no good, so he takes it.<p> 
			
			"We sure don't know how much money has been taken from  (Iraqis)...but it's enough to have serious socio-economic  consequences."<p> 
			
			Vriesinga estimates that in nine out of 10 raids, the home  owners are innocent but suffer huge consequences.<p> 
			
			"If the husband is hauled off as a suspect, the family has  lost its breadwinner and often lost its savings and cash as  well," he said, citing a Red Cross report that referred to up  to 90 percent of Iraqi detainees being innocent.<p> 
			
			If Iraqis filed complaints, it came down to a case of the  Iraqi suspect's word against the U.S. soldier's, he said.<p> 
			
			"If there's any doubt, then it's assumed the Iraqi is lying  -- the Americans are creating enemies by the score."<p>
