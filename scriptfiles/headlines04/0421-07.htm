<p>LONDON - The British American Tobacco (BAT) is making 
products which cause about 750,000 premature deaths around the world 
every year, a new report says.
<p>
The report 'BAT's Big Wheeze' accuses the company of an ”appalling 
health, environmental and development record” in advance of its annual 
general meeting Wednesday. 
<p>
   The report by the campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), 
leading development charity Christian Aid, and the environmental pressure 
group Friends of the Earth looks at BAT's record in Britain, Brazil, 
Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia and Uganda.
<p>
   ”Five million people die from smoking in the world each year,” the 
report says. ”BAT has a 15 percent share of the total tobacco market and 
sells 792 billion cigarettes a year under more than 300 brand names. By 
the year 2020 the number of deaths from smoking is expected to double to 
ten million. Seven million of these will be in developing countries where 
health services are already under-resourced and over-stretched.”
<p>
   The report says BAT is ”damaging the health of rural communities in 
Brazil and Kenya through encouraging the use of dangerous pesticides, in 
many cases without proper protection.” 
<p>
   It accuses the company of ”flooding Pakistan and Russia with 
advertising and sponsorship designed to addict a new generation of young 
people to cigarettes.” 
<p>
   The company is also encouraging more women smokers in Russia, the 
report says.
<p>
   It accuses BAT of lying about the health effects of cigarette smoke in 
claiming that there is no convincing evidence that environmental tobacco 
smoke (ETS) exposure increases the risk of non-smokers developing lung 
cancer or heart disease.
<p>
   BAT spokesman David Betteridge called the report a publicity 
stunt. ”They have spent months going back through their own archives, and 
there is nothing they have suggested here that they have not said before, 
and we've disputed.”
<p>
   The ASH activists have ”declined numerous requests for meetings with 
us,” Betteridge told IPS. He said BAT was not given an advance copy of 
the 25-page report.
<p>
   The BAT spokesman disputed several of the claims in the report. ”Our 
advertising in Russia is not aimed at under-age people,” he said. ”We 
don't do that, and besides, it's against the law.”
<p>
   Betteridge said the company was not planning a campaign at Russian 
women either. ”We are not persuading women to smoke,” he said. ”More 
women are working in Russia, they are doing more of the things that men 
do. We don't set out to get them to smoke.”
<p>
   Betteridge added: ”We do not want to persuade anyone to smoke. We did 
not invent smoking. All we say is that if people want to buy a cigarette, 
we'd like them to buy ours.”
<p>
   Ian Willmore from ASH said this is like someone saying ”it is okay to 
pick up a machine-gun and shoot someone, and then say he is not 
responsible because he didn't invent the machine-gun.”
<p>
   BAT has not refuted ASH claims ”because they're true,” he told 
IPS. ”Now BAT is trying to find new markets so that they can go and kill 
more people. The tobacco trade is the most disgraceful there is. In the 
arms trade you don't have to kill someone if you buy a gun. But smoking 
kills.”
<p>
   BAT has meanwhile reported operating profits for 2003 of 5 billion 
dollars, the report says. It says BAT directors are paid huge sums for 
their activities. Chief executive officer Martin Broughton receives 4.3 
million dollars a year. 
<p>
   ”Top Tory politician Kenneth Clarke MP is paid 225,000 dollars a year 
for chairing the company's committee on corporate social responsibility, 
and for other duties including helping to develop new markets in 
countries such as Vietnam.”
<p>
   The report says Broughton's claims that ”corporate social 
responsibility is integral to our approach to the management of our 
business globally” is ”greenwash, bluewash, and hogwash.”
<p>
   The report demands that the British government change the law to 
require companies and their directors to take account of social and 
environmental issues in all their activities.
<p>
   ”A new law on corporate accountability would require BAT to report on 
the negative impacts of their activities and products around the world, 
place legal duties on directors to take all reasonable steps to reduce 
these impacts, and enable affected communities abroad to seek 
compensation for health damage, human rights violations and environmental 
impacts in the UK courts,” the report says.
