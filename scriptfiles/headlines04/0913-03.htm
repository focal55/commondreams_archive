<p>WASHINGTON  - Secretary of State Colin Powell, who  made the case to the world that pre-war Iraq had stocks of  chemical and biological weapons, said on Monday he now thought  these will probably never be found.
<P>
"I think it's unlikely that we will find any stockpiles,"  Powell told lawmakers when asked about the intelligence behind  his Feb. 5, 2003, U.N. Security Council speech laying out U.S.  arguments for the war with Iraq that began six weeks later.
<P>
Powell's latest comments appeared to be his most explicit  to date suggesting that the central argument for President  Bush's decision to invade Iraq -- the belief it possessed  weapons of mass destruction -- was flawed.
<P>
As early as January Powell said it was an "open question"  whether or not such arms would be found and he conceded the  possibility Iraq might not have had any when the war began.
<P>
Bush himself had often said that even if no such weapons  are found he did the right thing in invading Iraq in March 2003  and toppling Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, arguing that the  country has been liberated from brutal dictatorship.
<P>
U.S. officials have also said that whether or not it had  stockpiles in 2003, Iraq was a threat because it had possessed  and used chemical weapons in the past, notably to kill 5,000  Iraqi Kurds in the town of Halabja in 1988.
<P>
The war in Iraq, in which more than 1,000 U.S. troops have  died, and the violent insurgency that has developed since the  U.S. invasion are a major issues in Bush's reelection battle  against Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
<P>
Powell made his comments as Charles Duelfer, the CIA-named  leader of the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, is  working on a report about his findings that was expected to be  completed in the next few weeks.
<P>
Duelfer's predecessor, David Kay, said as he left the post  in January that he believed there were no large stockpiles of  weapons of mass destruction when Washington went to war.
<P>
While he had reservations about the state of Iraq's efforts  to obtain nuclear weapons when he spoke before the U.N.  Security Council in February 2003, Powell insisted at that time  that it had stocks of both biological and chemical weapons.
<P>
"There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological  weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more,"  Powell said then, at one point holding up a vial of simulated  biological agent -- an image broadcast around the world.
<P>
"Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a  stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons  agent," he said at the time.
