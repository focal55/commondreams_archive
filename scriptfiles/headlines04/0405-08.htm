	JERUSALEM  - Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  backed away Monday from a personal pledge to President Bush not  to harm Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
<p> 
			
			Sharon, in a series of media interviews, also said his  unilateral plan to remove all Israeli settlements in the Gaza  Strip but no more than four in the West Bank could delay "for  many years" the creation of a Palestinian state.<p> 
			
			"I am not vouching for his physical safety," Sharon said of  Arafat, the Palestinian president Israel accuses of fomenting  violence in three years of conflict. Arafat denies the  allegations. "Whoever kills Jews or orders Jews and Israeli  citizens to be killed ... is a marked man," Sharon told Ynet,  the Web Site of Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.<p> 
			
			Sharon acknowledged that he had promised Bush not to harm  Arafat physically. But he said: "There have been changes since  then," including a U.S. decision to adopt Israel's refusal to  negotiate with Arafat.<p> 
			
			"At the time I made that undertaking, not to harm him  physically...he still went around on red carpets," Sharon told  the Maariv daily. "Today, even these people (who honored him)  know exactly the extent of the damage he has caused."<p> 
			
			But any move against Arafat would likely anger Washington,  Israel's main ally. After remarks Friday in which Sharon  threatened Arafat with assassination, the United States said it  opposed harming him and had made its position clear to Israel.<p> 
			
			The United States largely held its political fire after  Israel killed Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin in Gaza on March 22.  Washington regards Hamas, which has carried out dozens of  suicide bombings in Israel, as a terrorist organization.<p> 
			
			In the latest violence, the Israeli army killed three  Palestinians on a road it declared off-limits outside a Jewish  settlement in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian medics who recovered  the bodies said the men were unarmed.<p> 
			
			Israeli political commentators have said Sharon's tough  talk could be aimed at mollifying far-right coalition partners  opposed to his plans to uproot settlements as part of his  proposed "disengagement" from the Palestinians.<p> 
			
			Arafat brushed off Sharon's initial threats Friday, saying  he was more concerned for his people than for himself.<p> 
			
			SHARON DETAILS SCOPE OF PULLBACK<p> 
			
			Speaking on Army Radio, Sharon said there were still some  details to work out in his pullback plan, which he will ask  Bush to endorse when they meet in Washington on April 14.<p> 
			
			But referring to Israel's 21 Gaza settlements, he said: "I  believe our intention is to leave all of them."<p> 
			
			Without discussing a timetable, Sharon said a West Bank  pullback would be limited. "We are talking about four  settlements in Samaria (northern West Bank), no more," he said.<p> 
			
			"My plan is tough on the Palestinians. A mortal blow. Under  a unilateral process, there is no Palestinian state. This  situation could continue for many years," he told Yedioth  Ahronoth in a separate interview.<p> 
			
			While welcoming a pullout from occupied land, the  Palestinians have said unless Israel quits the West Bank  entirely there is little hope of reviving a Bush-backed "road  map" to peace with its vision of Palestinian statehood by 2005.<p> 
			
			They fear Sharon will annex West Bank settlement blocs in  drawing what he has said would be a new security line.<p> 
			
			Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said Sharon's plan  should be part of the road map and its vision of a negotiated  peace and viable state.<p> 
			
			Some 7,500 settlers live in hard-to-defend enclaves in  Gaza, which has a Palestinian population of 1.3 million, and  opinion polls show many Israelis favor removing them. There are  some 200,000 settlers and two million Palestinians in the West  Bank.
