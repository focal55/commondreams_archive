<p>WEST POINT, New York   - The United States'  declared war on terror is closer to the beginning than the end,  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told graduates of the U.S.  Military Academy on Saturday.
<P>
Rumsfeld told the 2004 graduating class of 935 cadets that  in the three years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on  America, the U.S.-led coalition had "overthrown two vicious  regimes and liberated 50 million people, disrupted terrorist  cells across the globe and thwarted many terrorist attacks."
<P>
"Yet despite our successes, we are closer to the beginning  of this struggle with global insurgency than to its end," he  said.
<P>
Rumsfeld addressed the graduates, who wore full dress  uniforms at West Point's Michie Stadium football field, before  heading back for Washington for the dedication of the World War  II Memorial.
<P>
Rumsfeld said the world "has changed dramatically" since  the Sept. 11 attacks when hijackers flew commercial airplanes  into buildings in New York and Washington, killing nearly  3,000.
<P>
He said on the latest front, in Iraq where the Bush  administration is facing continued fighting that is undermining  efforts to end the U.S. occupation, "We are facing a test of  wills, with an enemy that seeks to derail the Iraqi people's  path to self-governance."
<P>
"The extremists know the rise of a free, self-governing  Iraq, respectful of all religions - would deal the terrorists a  decisive blow," Rumsfeld said. "Its success depends on  encouraging friends and allies with whom we are so  interdependent to not be terrorized by threats or isolated by  fear."
