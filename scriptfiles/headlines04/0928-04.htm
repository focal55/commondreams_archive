<p>BAGHDAD  - U.S. warplanes bombarded rebel-held  areas of Iraq on Tuesday, targeting fighters loyal to Jordanian  militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, while Jordan's king said Iraq  was too dangerous for elections to be held in January.<p> 
			
			King Abdullah, one of Washington's staunchest Middle East  allies, said he didn't see how national polls could go ahead  amid such violence. His comments came after Secretary of State  Colin Powell admitted the insurgency was worsening.<p> 
			
			"It seems impossible to me to organize indisputable  elections in the chaos we see today," the king told French  daily Le Figaro before meeting President Jacques Chirac in  Paris.<p> 
			
			"If the elections take place in the current disorder, the  best-organized faction will be that of the extremists and the  result will reflect that advantage."<p> 
			
			U.S. forces struck against militants across the country.<p> 
			
			In Falluja, the military said it had hit a house used by  Zarqawi's followers, who have claimed responsibility for  several attacks in Iraq and the beheadings of foreign hostages.<p> 
			
			It said the air strike targeted high-level members of the  group, but did not say how many people were killed. The U.S.  military last week claimed to have killed around 100 of  Zarqawi's followers in the past few weeks.<p> 
			
			In Sadr City, a poor Shi'ite Muslim district of  northeastern Baghdad, residents said U.S. aircraft and tanks  bombarded homes in some neighborhoods, ratcheting up operations  against Shi'ite militiamen who have the area largely under  their control.<p> 
			
			The strikes wiped out the district's power, residents said.<p> 
			
			In a statement, U.S. forces said they had conducted  "precision strikes" on various targets, and at the same time  denied reports on Arabic TV and in Western newspapers of heavy  civilian casualties, with up to 10 killed and 46 wounded.<p> 
			
			Separately, the military said it had captured an insurgent  leader during a raid north of Baghdad. A statement said Hussein  Salman Mohammad al-Jabburi was seized near Kirkuk on Monday.<p> 
			
			In the southern city of Basra, insurgents ambushed a convoy  of armored Land Rovers, killing two British soldiers, a British  army spokesman said. The deaths raised to 25 the number of  British troops killed in action in Iraq.<p> 
			
			And in Ramadi, another insurgent stronghold west of  Baghdad, police and witnesses said a suicide car bomber  detonated his vehicle near a U.S. convoy, killing several  people, although the reports could not immediately be verified.<p> 
			
			HOPE FOR ITALIAN HOSTAGES<p> 
			
			Zarqawi and the group he leads, known as Tawhid wal-Jihad  (Monotheism and Holy War), are the U.S. military's prime enemy  in Iraq. Zarqawi, who Washington says is allied to Osama bin  Laden, has a $25 million bounty to his name.<p> 
			
			The militant is believed to have built a stronghold in  Falluja, 50 km (30 miles) west of Baghdad, since the U.S.  military withdrew from the city in April following weeks of  heavy fighting. Since then, the town has become a magnet for  Sunni insurgents and foreign fighters, the military says.<p> 
			
			Zarqawi's group says it kidnapped British engineer Kenneth  Bigley and two Americans from their home in Baghdad 12 days  ago. The group demanded that female prisoners be released from  jails in Iraq, a demand that was not met. The two Americans  were subsequently beheaded and their deaths posted on the  Internet.<p> 
			
			Bigley, 62, is also threatened with beheading.<p> 
			
			Palestinian officials said on Tuesday Palestinian President  Yasser Arafat would lobby for his release.<p> 
			
			While Bigley's fate remains uncertain, an Iranian diplomat  kidnapped nearly two months ago was freed on Monday.<p> 
			
			An Egyptian telecoms worker, one of six kidnapped last  week, was also freed, Cairo's embassy in Baghdad said. Efforts  were being made to have the remaining five released.<p> 
			
			The Iranian's release raised hopes for the fate of two  French journalists seized by the same group, the Islamic Army  in Iraq, on Aug. 20.<p> 
			
			There is also growing optimism over two Italian female aid  workers kidnapped from their Baghdad offices on Sept. 7.<p> 
			
			Al-Rai al-Aam, one of Kuwait's leading dailies, quoted  sources "very close to Islamic factions" as saying kidnappers  had agreed to free Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, both 29, as  early as this week, for a $1 million ransom.<p> 
			
			The Italian Prime Minister's office said it had no  immediate comment on the report, splashed across Italian  newspapers.<p>
