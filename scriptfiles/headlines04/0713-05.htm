<p>LONDON   - A CIA official who claims in a book that the West is losing the war on terror said in an interview Tuesday night that the war in Iraq was actually helping al-Qaida.
<P>
The 23-year veteran of the CIA, who also has spoken with the U.S. media, is releasing the book anonymously and has not identified himself.
<P>
"Iraq was a gift of epic proportions to Osama bin Laden and those who think like him," the man said, his face hidden during the interview on the British Broadcasting Corp. "Newsnight" show.
<P>
The CIA veteran's claim comes at a time when British Prime Minister Tony Blair is facing the prospect of another potentially critical report to be released on Wednesday on Britain's participation in the war in Iraq.
<P>
The book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574888498/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new"><i>Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror</i></a>," is to be released next month in the United States.
<P>
In the BBC interview the official dismisses two arguments that have been made by the Bush administration: that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are "on the run" and that the Iraq invasion has made America safer.
<P>
Criticizing the intelligence information used about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction before the war, the CIA official said: "Currently, we're in a lose-lose situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. If we stay, we bleed. If we go, the problem festers even worse."
<P>
He urged the United States to debate its policies in the Middle East, including its support for countries such as oil giant Saudi Arabia and its unqualified support for Israel.
<P>
"I think before you draft a policy to defeat bin Laden you have to understand that our policies are what drives him and those who follow him," the official told BBC.
<P>
Asked about the recent report of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on Iraq, he said: "If the message about the nature of the evidence was not given to the president, then it's not a question of bad analysis it's a question of bad management."
