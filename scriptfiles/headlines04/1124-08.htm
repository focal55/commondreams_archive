<p>NEW YORK - The signs are subtle, but ominous. The spring thaw 
arrives in much of the United States about two weeks earlier than it did 50 
years ago. Exotic tropical birds are nesting in Florida, and butterflies on 
the west coast are fleeing north to escape the heat.

					  <p>
					  
					  

Climate change is already happening, scientists say, and will get much 
worse unless something is done. If projected temperature increases of up to 
10 degrees Centigrade by the end of the century come true, mid-western 
agricultural states will suffer lost production, wildfires will ravage the 
west, and the coasts will be inundated.
<p>
”Global warming is one of the most significant threats to our quality of 
life,” Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski said bluntly last week.
<p>
Even as recognition of the problem grows, most states have given up looking 
for guidance from Washington, which disputes the scientific consensus on 
climate change.
<p>
Instead, they are redoubling their own efforts to crack down on the 
industries that produce greenhouse gases, and to begin the difficult shift 
away from oil dependence to clean energy sources like wind and solar.
<p>
”Most states would probably like the federal government to take the lead,” 
said Judi Greenwald of the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change. ”These 
programmes take a lot of resources to design and implement.”
<p>
”But to the extent that the absence of national leadership continues, more 
and more will continue to set their own policies, including a growing trend 
toward passing mandatory rules, as well as voluntary guidelines,” she said.
<p>
The Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that directs nations to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, will take effect next February with its recent 
approval by Russia's legislature.
<p>
However, U.S. President George W Bush has refused to submit the treaty to 
Congress for ratification because he says it unfairly singles out 
industrialised nations like the United States.
<p>
This country produces about one-quarter of the world's greenhouse gases, 
with Texas State alone regularly exceeding France in annual emissions.

<p>
Nearly every U.S. state now has programmes to reduce global warming 
pollution, and many have moved to the next step by working together in 
regional blocs. The most prominent projects include a cap-and-trade system 
for carbon dioxide emissions from utilities, developed by nine northeastern 
and mid-Atlantic states, and an alliance to boost energy efficiency and the 
use of renewables in the power grids of 19 western states.
<p>
State initiatives tend to frame climate change as an economic opportunity 
to produce alternative fuels, become renewable energy exporters, attract 
high-tech business, and to reduce other kinds of pollution as well, 
according to a Pew analysis that will be released in early December.
<p>
”The issue of global warming can be polarising when it's put out there all 
by itself,” Greenwald said. ”There has been a lot of public support for 
these (state) initiatives, partly because they are integrated with other 
things people care about.”
<p>
Some states are seeking technological innovations to solve the problem. For 
example, the Ohio Coal Development Office funds projects that capture and 
sequester carbon dioxide emissions from coal combustion, while the South 
Carolina Hydrogen Coalition is promoting economic development by building 
expertise in hydrogen technology.
<p>
Others are taking even stronger steps: for example, 16 states have mandated 
that electric utilities -- which account for nearly one-third of greenhouse 
gases -- generate a certain amount of power from renewable sources.
<p>
Last week, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington -- all west 
coast states facing the prospect of rising sea levels -- announced 36 
recommendations to fight global warming, including tightening emissions and 
energy efficiency targets, investing in fleets of hybrid gas-electric 
vehicles, and boosting retail energy sales from renewables at least one 
percent a year through 2015.
<p>
As the programme matures, the governors plan to promote market-based carbon 
trading and alternative fuels like hydrogen.
<p>
California has also taken a strong stance on tailpipe pollution, passing a 
rule in September to force automakers to start selling vehicles that are 30 
percent cleaner by 2016. The step makes it the first state to order a 
mandatory reduction of greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions, although several 
others, including New York and Massachusetts, intend to follow suit.
<p>

It remains to be seen whether vehicle makers, which have strenuously 
opposed the plan as too expensive and with unproven benefits, will comply 
or challenge it in court.
<p>
”We're evaluating all our options,” Eron Shosteck, director of 
communications for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, told IPS.
<p>
While environmental and consumer groups hope state initiatives will lay the 
groundwork for a comprehensive national policy on curbing global warming 
emissions, they are sceptical that Washington will change its tune anytime 
soon.
<p>
Last week, James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on 
Environmental Quality, announced a new plan to invest in companies that 
control methane, a greenhouse gas. ”We're carrying forward an aggressive 
programme of technology partnerships and international partnerships that 
will reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the American economy by 18 
percent,” he added.
<p>
However, critics noted that the target is entirely voluntary and represents 
the same rate of reduction that has occurred over the past decade -- about 
1.5 percent a year.
<p>
”The failure of policy-makers at the national level to address climate 
change has created a very real political situation in which the public and 
state politicians realise that they will have to compensate for this 
inaction,” said Joe Mendelson, legal director of the International Centre 
for Technology Assessment (ICTA), a non-profit group that examines how 
technology affects society.
<p>
ICTA, along with more than a dozen environmental groups and 11 state 
attorneys general, is suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
to force the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in new vehicles. A 
decision is expected by next summer.
<p>
”The refusal to use the tools that we have, like the Clean Air Act, will 
unfortunately lead to more and more confrontations and lawsuits,” Mendelson 
predicted.
