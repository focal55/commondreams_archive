<p> PARIS - European officials seem agreed that the abuse of Iraqi 

prisoners by U.S. and British forces rule the two countries out of an international 

peace initiative. But they stop short of considering a European policy 

independent of the United States.

 <p>

                  

   At the least the pictures of abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners have further 

undermined the already weak European backing for the war and occupation. 

Earlier supporters of the United States are now in withdrawal mode.

<p>

   Leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Union in Germany Angela 

Merkel who had strongly backed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq last year said this 

week that the images of torture ”put the credibility of democratic values at risk.” 

The support her party gave to a U.S. invasion lost it the elections in October 

2002.

<p>

   Merkel's criticism of U.S. conduct in Iraq is seen as a first step in distancing her 

party from the United States.

<p>

   Members of the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) who supported the 

United States are also beginning to step back from Washington. The torture 

photographs have ”permanently damaged the international reputation of the 

United States,” the right-wing foreign policy expert with the SPD parliamentary 

group Hans-Ulrich Klose said in a statement.

<p>

   ”I am not sure that the United States will ever again be capable of acting 

internationally as a superpower that commands respect,” Klose said. If the 

instances of torture are a part of systematic procedure, Germany's relations with 

the United States should be ”reconsidered intensively.”

<p>

   This is the closest a European official has come to a call for a European 

foreign policy that is run independent of the United States.

<p>

   German foreign minister Joseph Fischer asked the United States during a visit 

to Washington this week to restore its ”moral leadership” by carrying out a full 

investigation of the Iraqi prison abuse scandal.

<p>

   The French opposition to the war stands vindicated even more, and French 

leaders are determined to keep their distance from the Iraq mess. ”What we 

have seen and learnt (about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners) is shocking and 

dishonorable,” French foreign minister Michel Barnier said. Only a legitimate 

Iraqi government can offer a way out of the ”present tragedy”, he said.

<p>

   After a ”real, sincere transfer of sovereignty” an interim government must 

supervise free elections in January next year, Barnier said. That government 

could authorize use of a multinational military force replacing the present 

coalition, he said.

<p>

   But Barnier declared that France will not send troops to Iraq even if the United 

Nations replaces the U.S.-British coalition. France would at most train the Iraqi 

police, renegotiate the country's foreign debt and assist a new government build 

relations with Europe, he said.

<p>

   In Poland new Prime Minister Marek Belka is up against increasing pressure 

from the public and his own coalition partners who oppose Polish participation 

in the coalition force in Iraq. They want a timeline for withdrawal of Polish troops.

<p>

   Belka is not giving in. ”The withdrawal of our 2,400 soldiers from Iraq wouldn't 

bring us honor,” he said in a statement. 

<p>

   Belka, in office only since May 2 after his predecessor Leszek Miller quit, has 

the backing of President Aleksander Kwasnieski. ”The Polish troops will stay in 

Iraq until a certain order reigns,” Kwasnieski said during a visit to London. ”We 

have to fulfil our mission, and not do anything that would increase the chaos in 

Iraq.”

<p>

   But with the decision of new Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez 

Zapatero also to pull his forces back from Iraq, much of Europe is beginning to 

distance itself further from the United States, if not break with it yet.
