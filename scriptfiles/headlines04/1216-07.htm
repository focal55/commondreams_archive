<p>WASHINGTON—A much-anticipated test of George W. Bush's missile defence system ended in embarrassing failure yesterday, spurring critics to predict the multi-billion-dollar program could be set back for years.

<P>The Pentagon, calling the problem an "anomaly," said it would take as long as needed to determine why an interceptor missile shut itself down and never left its silo at Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.

<P>Yesterday's test came after two years of preparation.

<P>The Republican president made a bold appeal for full Canadian participation in the continental defence program during his visit to Ottawa two weeks ago, but any pressure on Prime Minister Paul Martin may have abated after yesterday's failure.

<P>"I am told there are some in Canada who worry about being left behind," said Philip Coyle, the former chief weapons inspector in the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton.

<P>"This thing has so far to go, there is nothing to worry about."

<P>Yesterday's $85 million (U.S.) test, known as a "fly by," was designed to gauge the capability of the interceptor booster.

<P>If it hit its target, that would have been considered a bonus. Instead the incoming missile crashed into the ocean.

<P>Yesterday's failure could be costly because another nine of the same boosters are already in place in Alaska and California silos. If a Pentagon investigation finds a major problem, all the others may need to be replaced.

<P>David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the Pentagon had erred by spending billions of dollars on interceptors and putting them in the silos without properly testing them.

<P>Some $80 billion (U.S.) or more has already been spent on the system, with a further $50 billion earmarked over the next five years.

<P>"I don't see why Canada would want to get involved with this thing," Wright said. "The public relations and politics are far ahead of the technical realities."

<P>A target missile carrying a mock warhead was successfully launched from Kodiak, Alaska, just after midnight yesterday, but as the interceptor missile prepared to launch 16 minutes later from its Marshall Islands site, it automatically shut down.

<P>Rick Lehner, a spokesperson for the U.S. Missile Defence Agency, said the Pentagon will follow a standard procedure and study all data before determining the problem. He offered no timeframe for the probe.

<P>"Obviously we would have liked to have had a complete exercise, but we had a good target launch," he said.

<P>Two previous tests were shut down because of bad weather, but Lehner said yesterday's weather was not a factor.

<P>The last test in December, 2002, also failed.

<P>The last successful test was in October, 2002. There have been nine tests in all, five of which have been deemed successful.

<P>But none has been launched in anything but ideal weather, and none has worked at night.

<P>In all the tests, the target was highly scripted with a meticulously studied trajectory, nothing remotely replicating the evasive path that would be taken by a missile launched from North Korea.

<P>In a series of interviews Martin granted in the hours before the failed test, he further distanced himself from full Canadian participation in the program, tossing doubt on whether the system would be able to shoot down incoming missiles.

<P>The Prime Minister, facing increasing Canadian opposition to joining the scheme, including dissent from within his own Liberal party, has said Ottawa would not put any money into building the shield, would not allow Washington to deploy interceptors on Canadian soil and would not join any system that led to the weaponization of space.

<P>An amendment to the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) agreement that Ottawa signed last summer allows the joint continental defence program to act as the early warning network for the missile program.

<P>Coyle said with another 20 to 30 tests scheduled, it could conceivably be 50 years before the missile system is ready to deploy. "If they are ever going to finish the testing process, they will have to pick up the pace," he said. "It could certainly be many years or a decade before this could be ready in any condition."

<P>But other experts suggested critics were overreacting to a failure that could just be a minor problem, easily remedied.

<P>"That's why they have tests," said David Jones, a former foreign affairs adviser to the chief of the U.S. Army.

<P>Jones said over the course of the history of major weapons systems, initial failures are the norm, not the exception.

<P>Baker Spring, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, called the failure a "non-test" and certainly not a major setback. He said the fact the system shut down instead of misfiring means it will be easier to pinpoint the problem.

<P>He said previous missile systems developed by the Pentagon have been highly successful and he said this should have no effect on the debate in Canada.

<P>"The U.S. policy from the get-go in this administration was that it would welcome friends and allies to help in the facilitation of this program to allow them to defend themselves," he said.

<P>"The U.S. has never tried to push this program on friends and allies who are not interested in it, but by the same token, the U.S. would never allow an ally to exercise a veto over any attempt to upgrade U.S. security."

<P>For that reason, he said, the NORAD amendment signed in August is sufficient for Washington to proceed as planned.

<P>In Ottawa, MP Alexa McDonough, the NDP's foreign affairs critic, said the failed test buys Canada "breathing room" to avoid joining the controversial program, the Toronto Star's Bruce Campion-Smith reports.

<P>"It is clear as the evidence mounts that this whole thing is lunacy," said McDonough (Halifax). "This all adds to the many, many people who have given testimony that the thing would never work."

<P>But after getting a briefing from defence and foreign affairs officials yesterday, McDonough said it's "absolutely clear" that Canada is moving ahead to join with the United States.

<P>"We didn't get any presentation that said here are the pros, here are the cons," she said. "They just simply were rationalizing their way to supporting Canada's participation."

<P>Even in the face of critics who said the program was far over budget and nowhere near ready, Bush spoke during the U.S. election campaign as if it was up and running.

<P>He had pledged to have the first stage of the system ready to go by the end of this year.

<P>"We say to those tyrants who believe they can blackmail America and the free world — you fire, we're going to shoot it down," he said during a stop in Pennsylvania last August.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2004 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
