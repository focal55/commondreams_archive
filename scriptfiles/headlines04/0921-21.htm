<P>NEW YORK  - Secretary of State Colin Powell said  on Tuesday the United States cannot wilt in the face of the  Iraqi insurgency and suggested critics of the war in Iraq were  becoming rattled and defeatist.
<P>
Powell spoke after senators from President Bush's  Republican party criticized U.S. policy in Iraq, where a U.S.  hostage was beheaded on Monday and his captors threatened to  kill an American and a Briton if their demands are not met.
<P>
"We can't just wilt in the face of this kind of challenge,  we have to meet the challenge," Powell told ABC's "Good Morning  America" program.
<P>
Bush was expected to defend his decision to invade Iraq and  topple former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein last year as well as  the U.S.-backed war that ousted the Taliban regime in  Afghanistan during a speech on Tuesday at the United Nations.
<P>
U.S. Sen. John Kerry, Bush's Democratic opponent in the  Nov. 2 U.S. presidential election, on Monday launched his  sharpest assault yet on what he called the Republican  president's "arrogance and outright incompetence" in Iraq.
<P>
Three influential Republican senators criticized mistakes  in Bush's policy on Sunday and one, Senate Foreign Relations  Chairman Richard Lugar of Indiana, cited "incompetence" in the  U.S. failure to spend more money to reconstruct Iraq.
<P>
"The fact is, we're in deep trouble in Iraq ... and I think  we're going to have to look at some recalibration of policy,"  Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska said on Sunday.
<P>
<b>'INSURGENCIES ARE TOUGH'
</b>
<P>
"It is a difficult struggle that we are in right now. There  is no question about it. Insurgencies are tough," Powell said.  "But to say that we can't deal with it, this sort of attitude  that we are on the verge of defeat, is absolutely wrong."
<P>
"This is the time to not take counsel of our fears and say  everything is falling apart," Powell added.
<P>
Sen. Joseph Biden from Delaware, the top Democrat on the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also speaking on "Good  Morning America," said he was tired of the Bush  administration's rhetoric on Iraq.
<P>"We're all saying the same thing: 'Mr. President, unless  you get your act together we are going to lose,"' Biden said,  saying the administration has been slow to train Iraqi forces,  spend U.S. reconstruction funds and enlist allies.
<P>
Video footage released on Monday showed U.S. contractor  Eugene Armstrong sitting blindfolded on the floor in an orange  jumpsuit, in front of standing hooded gunmen, one of whom then  sawed off his head.
<P>
The Tawhid and Jihad group led by al Qaeda ally Abu Musab  al-Zarqawi said in the footage of Armstrong's killing it would  behead the other two hostages within 24 hours unless female  inmates were released from the Abu Ghraib and Umm Qasr jails.
<P>
The U.S. military says it does not hold females in either  facility and has only two women in custody in Iraq.
<P>
A U.S. intelligence report prepared for Bush in July and  leaked to the media by U.S. officials last week offered a  gloomy outlook for Iraq through the end of 2005, with the worst  scenario being a descent into civil war.
<P>
Asked whether the administration was being candid on Iraq,  U.S. national security advisor Condoleezza Rice said the  assessment was an attempt to look at the big picture.
<P>
"That is no evidence that the Iraqis are falling into civil  war. Quite the opposite. Kurds and Shia and Sunnis are working  together to build a new Iraq," she told NBC's "Today" show.
<P>
"This insurgency has no political program. This is an  anarchist insurgency. They simply either want to take Iraq back  to the old days of Saddam Hussein or to turn Iraq into the  Taliban," she added.
