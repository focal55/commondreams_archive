<p>PARIS  - 
France expressed deep concern on Thursday
over the future of Iraq, saying prisoner abuses, the seizure of
foreign hostages and persistent violence showed the country and
region were spinning out of control.
<p>
 "It all gives the impression of a total lack of direction,"
Foreign Minister Michel Barnier told Le Monde newspaper in
unusually tough comments about Iraq under U.S.-led occupation.
<p>
 "What strikes me is the spiral of horror, of blood, of
inhumanity that one sees on all fronts, from Falluja to Gaza
and in the terrible pictures of the assassination of the
unfortunate American hostage," he added of images on an
Islamist Web site of the decapitation of a young American in
Iraq.
 <p>
 Barnier, due in Washington on Friday to meet U.S.
officials, reaffirmed that France would not contribute troops
to any peacekeeping force in Iraq and renewed his call for the
U.S.-led occupying force to hand over full sovereignty to the
Iraqis.
 <p>
 Paris, which led international opposition to the war in
Iraq, has sought to ease tensions with Washington and has
generally avoided harsh criticism of its policy there.
 <p>
 But France, Russia and others on the U.N. Security Council
want the United States to make sure that Iraqis have a major
say in their future before endorsing a U.N. resolution on the
official end of the occupation, due by June 30.
 <p>
 Barnier said the resolution should include arrangements for
an internationally-backed conference including various Iraqi
parties which would help guide the transition process -- an
idea which Moscow also backs but which has yet to gain wide
support.
 <p>
 He said the interim government to be put in place after
June 30 should have authority over Iraqi armed forces and that
the future administration to be elected next year should have
the power to end any foreign peacekeeping mission.
 <p>
 "The fully sovereign government which emerges from the 2005
elections should be able to decide what becomes of this force,
and if need be, its departure," he said.
 <p>
 French officials see the chaos in Iraq strengthening their
hand in the Security Council negotiations over the future of
Iraq and as a justification of their stance against the war,
which they said flouted international law.
 <p>
 Barnier said the difficulties of the U.S.-led coalition
only demonstrated the importance of adhering to international
law, respecting human rights and seeing armed force as a last
resort.
 <p>
 "This is all the more reason to reaffirm (those principles)
as guides in these moments of trouble and doubt," he said.</p>
