      <p>The abusive treatment of inmates at Guant&#225;namo Bay was far more 
        widespread than the Pentagon has admitted, according to a new report published 
        yesterday. 
      <p>Many detainees at the US prison camp were "regularly subjected to harsh 
        and coercive treatment" over a long period of time, far beyond the isolated 
        cases that have been acknowledged to date, according to the report, which 
        appeared in the New York Times. 
      <p>It quoted sources who once worked at the naval base and who were angry 
        at the treatment dealt out to the prisoners, suspected terrorists from 
        around the world who have been held without charge, most for more than 
        two years. 
      <p>The harsh treatment was intended to persuade inmates to talk, and was 
        matched by incentives to co-operate. 
      <p>One "regular procedure" was making prisoners strip to their underwear, 
        sit on a chair while their hands and feet were shackled to a bolt on the 
        ground, while they were subjected to strobe lights, loud music (reportedly 
        by Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine and Eminem) and cold. Such sessions 
        could go on for up to 14 hours, with a few breaks. 
      <p>"It fried them," one official was quoted as saying. Another said: "They 
        were very wobbly. They came back to their cells and were completely out 
        of it." 
      <p>Responding to the report, a Pentagon spokesman, Major Paul Swiergosz, 
        said yesterday: "We take all allegations of detainee abuse seriously, 
        and ... we've directed several enquiries to be conducted into a number 
        of allegations." 
      <p>He pointed to an earlier Pentagon statement stating that: "Guant&#225;namo 
        guards provide an environment that is stable, secure, safe and humane. 
        And it is that environment that sets the conditions for interrogators 
        to work successfully and to gain valuable information from detainees because 
        they have built a relationship of trust, not fear." 
      <p>Following the revelations earlier this year that torture was used by 
        US military guards at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, the US military 
        held enquiries, which found that a number of harsh interrogation techniques 
        had been approved for use in Guant&#225;namo by the defence secretary, 
        Donald Rumsfeld, but that they were rarely used. 
      <p>The New York Times allegations suggest instead that the procedures used 
        went beyond those guidelines, which allow interrogators to place detainees 
        "in a setting that may be less comfortable" but should not "constitute 
        a substantial change in environmental quality". 
      <p>Yesterday's report quoted an intelligence official as saying that much 
        of the harshest interrogation was focused on a "dirty thirty" of detainees, 
        thought to represent the best potential sources of intelligence on al-Qaida. 
      <p>However, other reports have suggested that very little, if any, "actionable" 
        intelligence has emerged from the more than 600 prisoners held at Guantanamo 
        Bay, scores of whom have since been transferred to their home countries 
        without charges. 
      <p>High level al-Qaida captives, like Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and Abu Zubaidah 
        have been held at secret locations in allied countries in the Middle East 
        and elsewhere. Human rights group allege that these high-value prisoners 
        are being held outside US territory to avoid legal obstacles to the use 
        of torture. 
      <p>One military official said yesterday it was not clear when the sources 
        quoted in the report worked at Guant&#225;namo Bay, suggesting that procedures 
        had recently improved. "There has been - after detainee abuse allegations, 
        - a number of reviews, so it is important what period is being talked 
        about," the official said.
