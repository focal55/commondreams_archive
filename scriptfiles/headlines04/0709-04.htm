<p>Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader  --  still not on the 
ballot in a single state  --  has received a recent windfall of contributions 
from deep-pocketed Republicans with a history of big contributions to the 
party, an analysis of federal records show.
<P>Nearly one  in 10 of Nader's major donors  --  those writing checks of $1,
000 or more  --  have given in recent months to the Bush-Cheney campaign, the 
latest documents show. GOP fund-raisers also have "bundled" contributions  --  
gathering hefty donations for maximum effect to help Nader, who has criticized 
the practice in the past.
<P>The donations from wealthy Republicans  --  combined with increasingly 
vocal Democratic charges that they represent a stealth GOP effort to wound 
Democrat John Kerry  --  prompted Nader's vice presidential running mate, 
Green Party member Peter Camejo, to suggest the consumer advocate reject the 
money that doesn't come from loyal Nader voters.
<P>"If there has been a wave of these (donations), then that's something 
Ralph and I will have to talk about  --  and about returning their money,'' he 
said Thursday in an interview with The Chronicle. "If you oppose the war, if 
you're against the Patriot Act, your money is welcome.
<P>"But if your purpose is because you think this is going to have an 
electoral effect, we don't want that money. I take no money from people who 
disagree with us,'' Camejo said. "We're not interested in that.''
<P>But Camejo's views differ with Nader's recent defense of the 
contributions.
<P>"We have no indication that the Republicans are trying to maneuver 
support for us,'' he said at a recent press conference. "There are three or 
four major Republican donors who have contributed to my campaign. But that's 
because I worked with them on a number of issues. ... It's all very small, 
relatively small, contributions. And we like it that way.''
<P>But the financial records show that $23,000 in checks of $1,000 or more 
have come from loyal Republicans. Among those who have given recently to Nader 
are Houston businessman Nijad Fares, who donated $200,000 to President Bush's 
2000 inaugural committee; Richard J. Egan, the former ambassador to Ireland, 
and his wife, Pamela, who have raised more than $300,000 for Bush; Michigan 
developer Ghassan Saab, who has given $30,000 to the RNC since 2001; and 
frozen food magnate Jeno Paulucci, and his wife, Lois, who have donated $150,
000 to GOP causes since 2000 alone.
<P>All have donated the maximum $2,000 to Nader's campaign since April, 
records show.
<P>Asked about the money from GOP backers, Nader campaign spokesman Kevin 
Zeese countered that many of Kerry's donors also had given to Republicans, 
including Bush in the past.
<P>"(Kerry) should renounce those donations and give them all back,'' he 
said. Pressed if Nader would do the same, Zeese said that wouldn't even be 
discussed "until (the parties) start to change the rules.''
<P>With just under four  months left to the election, Nader has yet to 
qualify for a single state ballot.
<P>A statewide poll by the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose 
State University released Wednesday indicates that if Nader qualifies as a 
presidential candidate on the California ballot,  the former consumer advocate 
would steal support from the Democratic ticket almost exclusively.
<P>"He would drain about 4 percent of Kerry's support, almost all of it from 
Democrats, while having a negligible impact on Bush's vote or his support 
among Republicans,'' according to Institute director Phil Trounstine.
<P>Democrats are worried about Nader's influence because they believe as a 
Green Party candidate in 2000, he pulled votes that would have gone to 
Democratic Vice President Al Gore in key states, thus helping Bush win the 
election. 
<P>Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who was a spokesman for Gore's 2000 
presidential campaign, said the check-writing was not "a merely serendipitous 
confluence of events,'' adding that "folks supporting Bush because they want 
fewer environmental protections and less corporate regulations don't have a 
lot in common with the Ralph Nader agenda. The only thing they have in common 
with Nader is they want to take votes from Kerry.''
<P>But Christine Iverson, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, 
calls such charges ridiculous, adding: "It's unfortunate that Democrats seem 
determined to disenfranchise voters who want an opportunity to cast votes for 
Ralph Nader.''
<P>Still, other Republicans acknowledge that many in the party have 
mentioned that a donation to Nader may boost Bush, particularly in states 
where the vote is expected to be close. 
<P>"Republicans have no problem with it, if the goal is to keep President 
Bush in office,'' said Hoover Institution research fellow Bill Whalen, a 
veteran GOP strategist. "It's not pretty. But putting a guy (in the White 
House) you don't like is not pretty either.''
<P>Whalen said the Republican National Committee or the Bush-Cheney campaign 
can't technically condone such donations, but "you absolutely want your 
activists to get out there and help Ralph run'' because of the effects he had 
on the 2000 election. 
<P>"Do the math,'' Whalen said.
<P>Nader, who has decried the influence of corporations in the political 
arena, also has received more than $20,000 in "bundled'' contributions since 
March from GOP fund-raisers, according to the Federal Elections Commission 
documents that tally donations through May 31. 
<P>Bundling is the practice of gathering contributions together for maximum 
influence.
<P>Records show Nader raised just more than $1 million for his presidential 
effort through May 31. Most of the money came from small, individual donors. 
<P>But Zeese said the Republican donors were "people whom Ralph knows from 
previous work.''
<P>He downplayed the bundled donations, such as $18,850 in checks collected 
and submitted to Nader in May by Peter Tanous, president of Washington D.C.-
based Lynx Investment Advisories.
<P>"That was a house party,'' Zeese said of the donations collected by 
Tanous. 
<P>Tanous, who also made a personal $2,000 donation to Nader in May, was 
traveling and unavailable for comment Thursday, but his wife, Ann, said that 
her husband raised money for Nader because "he's a good friend.''
<P>"My husband's a die-hard Republican who's supporting (Nader) so that 
there are other voices, other than the ones we're hearing in this election,'' 
particularly on issues that include Middle East politics, she said. 
<P>She declined to say whether her husband, who also donated $4,000 to the 
Republican National Committee and $2,000 to the Bush-Cheney campaign this year,
would vote for Nader.
<P>Tanous, records show, has also donated in the past to some Democrats, 
including $500 last year to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of San 
Francisco. 
<P>Whalen says that Nader is playing games when he suggests that his donors 
are merely acting in friendship and that his message will resonate with GOP 
faithful. 
<P>"What's at the heart and soul of the Nader campaign? That corporations 
are evil and that we need to get out of Iraq,'' Whalen said.
