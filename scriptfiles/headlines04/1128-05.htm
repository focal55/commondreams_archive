<P>The Government is preparing to send up to 1,000 more British troops to Iraq in the run-up to the first democratic elections there for more than 50 years.
	

<P>The soldiers, from the 2nd Battalion The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, based at Ternhill, Shropshire, are expected to begin deploying to southern Iraq shortly after Christmas.

<P>Defence chiefs are convinced that insurgents will intensify attacks against coalition forces across the country to delay and disrupt the elections, called for January 30.

<P>The regiment, which has the nickname "the Tigers" from its service in India in the 19th century, is the Army's "very high readiness" unit and the immediate reserve for deployment to Iraq.

<P>The 650-strong unit is on 10 days' notice to move and expects to receive a "Warning Order" and deployment dates within weeks. The battalion has completed its pre-deployment training and morale within the unit is said to be exceptionally high.

<P>If the deployment is approved, the regiment will be joined by soldiers from other units, who will perform support functions, taking the total of extra men and women sent to Iraq to about 1,000.

<P>The final decision on when the deployment will take place rests with the Major Gen Bill Rollo, the officer in command of British forces in Iraq.

<P>Although he has yet formally to ask for more troops, contingency planning for the deployment is at an advanced stage. Last night, the Ministry of Defence said a final decision had not been taken but it was examining the option of sending more soldiers to Iraq.

<P>A senior Army officer said that the expectation within the military was that the additional deployment was inevitable.

<P>"The level of expectation that the battalion will be sent to Iraq is very high," he said.

<P>"2PWRR has not been given any formal notice of a move yet but it is expected. The belief is that they, along with other troops, will be deployed as a reinforced battle group of around 1,000 men shortly after Christmas, possibly in the first week of the New Year.

<P>"It's important that the coalition forces do not allow the insurgents to regroup after the United States marines' successful attack on Fallujah.

<P>"Both the British and American forces must now press home this advantage. Keeping the insurgents at bay will be vital if the elections are to be democratic and successful and achieving that will require extra troops."

<P>The officer said he expected coalition forces to mount attacks against insurgent strongholds in central and northern Iraq.

<P>Last week, Gen Sir Mike Jackson, the Chief of the General Staff, said that the Black Watch would not be replaced by another infantry unit, but British troops might be sent to fight in other parts of Iraq.

<P>A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: " We keep troop levels under constant review and we are looking at options of sending more troops to Iraq in the run-up to the elections if needed. The decision rests with the commander on the ground."

<P>Iyad Allawi, Iraq's interim prime minister, and leading Shia parties said yesterday that elections should go ahead on schedule, despite calls from Sunni and Kurdish parties for delays.

<P>A spokesman said that Dr Allawi took very seriously his obligation to hold elections by the end of January, as mandated by the interim constitution and by a United Nations Security Council resolution.

<P>"The prime minister is aware of the statement made by some parties yesterday calling for a delay in holding elections," Thaer al-Naqib said.

<P>"He understands the concern of these groups, but is equally aware of the determination of others to see elections held on time."

<P>He said that Dr Allawi believed that "the key to building real and lasting democracy and stability in Iraq is ensuring that all Iraqi citizens can vote" and "he does not believe that a delay will necessarily make such broad participation any easier to achieve".<p align="center">&copy; Copyright of Telegraph Group Limited 2004.</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
