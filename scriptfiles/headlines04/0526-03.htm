Hundreds of people lined North Hanover Street near the entrance to the Army War College Monday evening to peacefully protest President Bush's policies. 
<p>The impromptu protest, organized after Bush&#039;s plans to visit Carlisle were announced Friday, drew diverse groups. Carrying signs and shouting slogans such as &quot;Impeach Bush now,&quot; protesters encouraged people driving by to honk their horns in support.<p>
More than a dozen Bush supporters also showed up &#045; but only one argument got loud enough to attract police, who quickly ended the confrontation between two Vietnam War veterans who had served with the Army&#039;s 82nd Airborne Division. One is a Bush supporter &#045; and the other isn&#039;t.<p>
Otherwise the gathering took on a party atmosphere.<p>
&quot;It&#039;s kind of like making a joyful noise here,&quot; said the Rev. Sandra Mackie, a Lutheran pastor from Dillsburg.<p>

&quot;I preach and teach peacemaking,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#039;m just here to voice my opinion that war is not the answer.&quot;
<p>
Teenagers Sophia and Natalia Van Doren of Carlisle calmly played their violins in the midst of the crowd.<p>
&quot;I&#039;m very happy to see so many people on such short notice,&quot; said their mother, Alaina Van Doren.<p>
<strong>Signs evident</strong><p>
Most of the protesters carried handmade signs with messages such as &quot;Support the Troops, Bring Them Home Now,&quot; and &quot;Not With Our Sons and Daughters.&quot;<p>
The president flew into the post by helicopter and would not have had an opportunity to see the signs, but that didn&#039;t dampen the demonstrators&#039; enthusiasm.<p>
Carlisle resident Ken Albright attended with his wife to raise his voice in protest.<p>
&quot;I think Bush has lied to us big time,&quot; he said. &quot;The legitimacy of the war is completely in question.&quot;<p>
Carrying a sign that read &quot;We&#039;ve Lost the Moral High Ground,&quot; Harrisburg resident Karen Lutz attended with her golden retriever.<p>
&quot;I just so strongly oppose what this administration has done to the American people. We had the good will of the world with us on Sept. 11 and the president squandered it,&quot; Lutz said. &quot;This administration had no real mandate and they&#039;ve taken us to the darkest place in our history.&quot;<p>
She said protesters must get organized in November and bring other people with them to the polls to defeat Bush.<p>
Victoria Sams and Susan Rose were part of a group from Dickinson College in Carlisle protesting against Bush and the war.<p>
&quot;We heard that Bush was coming here&quot; and wanted to lend support to the protest effort, said Sams, a college employee. She called Bush&#039;s presidency &quot;one of the most destructive administrations in my life.&quot;<p>
Members of the &quot;Carlisle Peace College,&quot; a group that mounts monthly protests at the war college, planned the 7 p.m. protest. Leader Ben Price said people began arriving shortly after 5 for Monday&#039;s protest.<p>
&quot;We do support the troops but we don&#039;t want them to come home in body bags,&quot; he said.<p>
Richard Burrill, a peace college supporter from Stoverstown in York County, said he wants troops to come home.<p>
&quot;We&#039;re in protest to the president of the United States to come here to push his war,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#039;s no way he can rebuild our reputation around the world.&quot;<p>
Mary Ann Evans of West Pennsboro Township, who attended with her two sons and a friend, said &quot;We made the effort to go to Washington and New York because we think Bush is wrong and the war is wrong. Certainly we&#039;re going to come to Carlisle to let him know what we think.<p>
&quot;He is lying. We&#039;re in a war and people are being killed.&quot;<p>
<strong>Perry teens protest</strong><p>
Seven Perry County teens, all students or graduates of Newport High School, called for the president&#039;s ouster at the polls.<p>
&quot;We don&#039;t want Bush to be in office anymore,&quot; said Alea Drain, 17. &quot;A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush.&quot;<p>
One of the signs the teens carried said &quot;Register Green, Vote Democratic.&quot;<p>
&quot;The liberals need to come together for one (candidate),&quot; said Tim Harper, 18, a senior at Newport High School. &quot;Anyone would be better than what we have now. All the mistakes he&#039;s made &#045; when I&#039;m 30 or 40, I&#039;m going to be paying for it.&quot;<p>
Joan and Bill Freeman traveled from Shippensburg to protest. &quot;We&#039;ve been against the war from the beginning. There weren&#039;t convincing reasons why we went to war,&quot; Bill Freeman said.<p>
Instead, the United Nations should have been allowed to act, he said. &quot;We didn&#039;t find any weapons of mass destruction; we&#039;re getting lots killed. We&#039;re making lots of terrorists.&quot;<p>
The country was &quot;taken to war by a president who didn&#039;t receive the majority of votes in the country.&quot;<p>
<strong>They support president</strong><p>
About 15 to 20 Bush supporters showed up with signs sporting slogans such as &quot;PA is Bush Country.&quot;<p>
John D. Stouffer of Enola said Bush&#039;s emphasis on homeland security impresses him.<p>
&quot;He said he wanted Osama dead or alive,&quot; Stouffer said.<p>
At a time of crisis, you want someone to take action right away, he added. &quot;You&#039;ve got to protect your homeland.&quot;<p>
Ron Murray of Lebanon carried signs that said &quot;Support Our Troops&quot; and &quot;Deport Anti-War Protesters.&quot;<p>
&quot;I want to keep this country safe and free for my grandbabies and my children,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I care that this country stays as safe as it was when I was growing up.&quot;<p>
Murray was willing to back up his views. He was one of the two Vietnam veterans involved in the shouting match near the war college entrance.
