<p>WASHINGTON --
When Arizona schools superintendent Lisa Graham Keegan and a group 
of predominantly conservative educators began the Education Leaders Council in 
1995, their proclaimed goal was to upset an educational establishment long 
dominated by the Democrats and left-leaning teachers unions.
<P>Nearly a decade later, Keegan and her allies have become the 
establishment  --  and the left is crying foul.
<P>People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, recently released 
a report depicting Keegan's group as the center of "a network of right-wing 
foundations" that have received more than $77 million in U.S. Department of 
Education funds to promote their "school privatization" agenda. The report 
notes that a co-founder of the council, former Pennsylvania education 
secretary Eugene W. Hickok, is now the second-ranking official at the federal 
agency.
<P>While there is a tradition of Republican and Democratic administrations 
rewarding allies, critics argue that the amount of money steered toward 
conservative educational groups by the Bush administration far exceeds the 
practices of the past.
<P>"It's a farce," said Kathleen Lyons, spokeswoman for the National 
Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country. "On the one 
hand, we have the Bush administration claiming that its education reforms are 
all scientifically based, and on the other hand we see the administration 
providing a grab bag of Santa gifts to conservative groups."
<P>The People for the American Way report "exposes a stealth campaign by the 
administration to reward groups that support its private-school voucher agenda 
at the expense of strengthening public schools," said Edward Kennedy of 
Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate education committee.
<P>"Balderdash," said Education Undersecretary Hickok. If there were any 
favoritism, he said, it was "favoritism in the sense that we support those 
organizations that support No Child Left Behind," a law President Bush signed 
in January 2002 that intends to raise educational standards through high-
stakes testing and better-qualified teachers.
<P>"Welcome to the vast right-wing conspiracy," laughed Keegan, chief 
executive of the Education Leaders Council, who was a candidate for secretary 
of education after Bush was elected.
<P>Education Department records show that the council received $13.5 million 
over the last two years for its "Following the Leaders" project, which 
develops computer programs to monitor implementation of the No Child Left 
Behind law. A further $45 million in grants has been awarded to groups closely 
associated with Keegan's organization, such as the National Council on Teacher 
Quality and the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence.
<P>The bulk of the money the department gave Keegan's network has gone to 
developing alternative forms of teacher certification. The No Child Left 
Behind law stipulates that every student has the right to a "fully qualified" 
teacher, a requirement that has strained traditional teacher training colleges.
<P>Keegan said it was only natural that the Bush administration should want 
to correct a liberal bias in American education by giving grants to groups 
that share its philosophy. While she rejects the "right-wing" tag, she says 
"it is necessary to be ideological in education these days if you want to 
promote academic standards, school choice and new routes to certifying 
teachers that work against the grain of current ideas in education."</p>
