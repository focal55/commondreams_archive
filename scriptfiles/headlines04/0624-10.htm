<p>WASHINGTON  - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore  on Thursday accused President Bush of telling "an artful and  important lie" soon after the Sept. 11 attacks to set the stage  for war on Iraq.

"Beginning very soon after the attacks of 9/11, President  Bush made a decision to start mentioning Osama bin Laden and  Saddam Hussein in the same breath in a cynical mantra designed  to fuse them together as one in the public's mind," Gore said  in a speech at Georgetown University Law Center.
<p>Gore, a Democrat who lost to Bush in a White House race  ultimately decided by the Supreme Court despite winning the  popular vote in 2000, cited the recent report by the Sept. 11  commission saying no credible evidence existed of a link  between the Iraqi leader and bin Laden.
<p>He said Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney continue to  argue for a connection between bin Laden's al Qaeda network and  the deposed Iraqi regime because it supports their push for war  in Iraq and justifies "some of the new power they've picked up  from the Congress and the courts" since the 2001 hijack attacks  in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.
<p>"As a result, President Bush is now intentionally  misleading the American people," Gore said. "Indeed, Bush's  consistent and careful artifice is itself evidence that he knew  full well that he was telling an artful and important lie --  visibly circumnavigating the truth over and over again as if he  had practiced how to avoid encountering the truth."
<p>In an hour-long address punctuated by polite laughter and  applause, Gore also accused the Bush administration of working  closely "with a network of 'rapid response' digital Brown  Shirts who work to pressure reporters and their editors for  'undermining support for our troops."'<p>
