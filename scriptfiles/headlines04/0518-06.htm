LOS ANGELES  - Concern among evangelical  Christians over the course of the war in Iraq is opening a  crack in their strong bond with President Bush and the  Republican Party, political analysts who track this powerful  voting group said.
<p> 
			
			But they caution there are doubts over whether John Kerry  can lure evangelicals into the Democratic camp in November's  presidential election.<p> 
			
			"I know there are a lot of evangelicals who are  disillusioned with the war and worried about a lot of things,  the Woodward book, the Clarke book ... (and) how we got into  this thing," said Richard Mouw, president of Fuller Theological  Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., referring to recent books on the  al Qaeda threat and the Iraqi war and occupation.<p> 
			
			Compounding that is the growing scandal about prisoner  abuses by U.S. troops in Iraq.<p> 
			
			Evangelical Christians are still expected to vote  overwhelmingly for Bush, but the erosion of support could  reduce their turnout on election day, a potentially ominous  development for the incumbent president.<p> 
			
			If the race is very close in several states, experts said  poor turnout by this core voting group could conceivably cost  Bush the election, especially if a cliffhanger like the Florida  contest in 2000 were to reoccur.<p> 
			
			Some academics estimate evangelical Christians represent 25  to 30 percent of the 105 million people who voted in the last  presidential election. Evangelical Christians are concentrated  in Southern and Midwestern states considered by many political  analysts to be the battleground of the 2004 campaign.<p> 
			
			Traditionally evangelicals have been politically  conservative and voted overwhelmingly Republican although some  Democratic candidates have been able to win a substantial slice  of their vote, most notably Jimmy Carter, a self-described  born-again Christian, in 1976.<p> 
			
			"I don't see anything but trouble over there (in Iraq).  People could increasingly become disenchanted with George Bush,  evangelicals too," said Derek Davis, director of the J.M.  Dawson Institute of Church-State Studies at Baylor University.<p> 
			
			"I think the war could have an effect on the evangelical  vote," he said but estimated it would cost Bush no more than 10  to 15 percent of support among evangelicals at the most. He  noted that in the 2000 election Bush received about 80 to 85  percent of the evangelical vote.<p> 
			
			Evangelical Christians consider President Bush, a man who  frequently refers to his Christian beliefs, as one of their  own. Kerry in contrast is a Roman Catholic who rarely talks in  the public about his faith and is in the midst of controversy  as conservative Catholic bishops talk about withholding  communion from him because of his views on abortion rights.<p> 
			
			"John Kerry ... likes to use the mantra that JFK used about  observing the principle of separation of church and state,"  Davis said.<p> 
			
			SEPARATION PRINCIPLE<p> 
			
			Kennedy, the first Roman Catholic to be elected president  of the United States, said in a widely quoted 1960 speech aimed  at quelling Protestant fears about his religion: "I do not  speak for my church on public matters -- and the church does  not speak for me."<p> 
			
			But Kerry's disinclination to speak in public about his  religious beliefs is not sitting well with some evangelicals.<p> 
			
			"In distancing himself from the Catholic church he  distances himself from religion and that doesn't resonate well  with evangelical Christians," said Corwin Smidt, executive  director of the Henry Institute for the Study of Christianity  and Politics in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<p> 
			
			Smidt noted that evangelicals would be influenced by  several issues including the war in Iraq, gay marriage and the  economy but their "comfort level" with candidates would also be  very important.<p> 
			
			"They (evangelicals) don't just vote on the issues but for  candidates they feel comfortable with," Smidt said, noting  currently such considerations favored Bush.<p> 
			
			"There is a religious quality to American public life and  really distinguishes it from public life in other western  democracies," he added.<p> 
			
			Davis said many evangelical Christians were concerned that  the nation was in a "moral vacuum" and wanted to "renew the  Christian roots of our nationhood."  "Many Christians feel we are in trouble morally and if we don't  do something radical our Christian heritage is going to be lost  to the secularist, the atheist, etc. etc.," he said.<p> 
			
			"The solution to most evangelical Christians is a  Republican vote," Davis added.
