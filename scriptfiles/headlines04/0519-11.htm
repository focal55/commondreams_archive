MIAMI   - A U.S. judge on Wednesday acquitted  environmental protection group Greenpeace on charges it  conspired to break the law by sending activists aboard a  freighter carrying illegally felled mahogany two years ago.
<p>The politically charged case dusted off a law not used  since 1890 to bring the first criminal prosecution by U.S.  authorities of an advocacy group for civil disobedience.
<p>U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan granted a Greenpeace  motion to dismiss the charges after the prosecution rested on  the third day of trial, ruling federal prosecutors had failed  to prove their case, a Greenpeace lawyer said.
<p>"We're elated. This is a real victory for America's  tradition of free speech," said John Passacantando, the  executive director of Greenpeace U.S. "But our liberties are  still in jeopardy, of course. The Bush administration is intent  on stifling free speech."

The case stemmed from a day in April 2002 when two  Greenpeace activists climbed onto the APL Jade freighter just  off Miami to hang a sign reading: "President Bush: Stop Illegal  Logging."
<p>Two Greenpeace members were charged and pleaded guilty  after the incident. Fifteen months later, prosecutors targeted  the entire organization with a grand jury indictment.
<p>Civil rights advocates said the obscurity of the law used  to take Greenpeace to court suggested the case was revenge for  Greenpeace's criticism of President Bush's environmental  policies.
<p>Passed in 1872 to prevent "sailor mongering," the law has  been gathering dust since it was last prosecuted in 1890.
<p>Sailor mongering was common in the 19th century, when  brothels sent whores onto ships before they had reached harbor  to lure sailors ashore with booze and promises of warm beds.
<p>Greenpeace was accused of illegally boarding the APL Jade,  as the 964-foot (294-meter) vessel "was about to arrive at the  place of her destination." It also faces a charge of conspiring  to commit that crime.
<p>U.S. prosecutors argued Greenpeace conspired to break the  law by recruiting "climbers" for the seaborne protest and by  using a Greenpeace corporate credit card to rent a boat.
<p>Greenpeace challenged the prosecution on the wording of the  law, saying the ship was too far offshore when it was boarded  to be considered "about to arrive" at its destination.
<p>Greenpeace general counsel Tom Wetterer said the statute  failed to define what "about to arrive" meant and the judge  agreed it was too vague.
<p>The boarding of the APL Jade was part of a global campaign  to stop the illegal logging of mahogany in Brazil's Amazon, a  lucrative trade blamed for the destruction of vast swathes of  rain forest.
<p>Advocacy groups had said a conviction would be a blow to  Brazilian efforts to win more backing for its fight against the  illegal mahogany trade from the United States, the biggest  market for a wood so valuable it boasts fatter profit margins  than cocaine.
