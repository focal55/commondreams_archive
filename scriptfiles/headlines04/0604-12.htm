<p>Security forces turned Rome into a fortress as anti-war protesters pledged a heated reception for US President George W. Bush who began a 36-hour visit here with an audience with Pope John Paul II.
<p>The pope told Bush the situation in the occupied Iraq should be "normalized as quickly as possible" with the help of the international community and the United Nations.</p>

<p>John Paul II, who said Bush's visit comes at a time of "great concern" over unrest in the Middle East, also implicitly condemned the recently revealed abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers in Iraq.</p>

<p>"In the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all, and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values," the head of the Roman Catholic Church said.</p>

<p>The tenor of their meeting was cordial, however, with the pope paying tribute to the commitment of the US government and humanitarian agencies, and ending his address to Bush by saying "God bless America".</p>

<p>Bush, describing John Paul II as "a devoted servant of God who has championed the cause of the poor", presented the pope with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, his country's highest civilian award. </p>

<p>He told the pope his government "will work for human liberty and human dignity, in order to spread peace and compassion; that we appreciate the strong symbol of freedom that you have stood for, and we recognize the power of freedom to change societies and to change the world".</p>

<p>Bush, accompanied by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, his staunch ally in Iraq, later laid a wreath at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome to commemorate one of Italy's biggest wartime massacres of civilians by Nazis. </p>

<p>The commemoration is part of the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Rome by Allied troops, the official reason for Bush's visit. He will also visit France for D-Day celebrations in Normandy on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Carabinieri police saturated the historic city centre, with heavy concentrations of the paramilitary force along the main thoroughfares and piazzas, as well as at bridges, rail stations and airports. Helicopters droned overhead. </p>

<p>Around 10,000 anti-war protesters, mostly students, were on the streets early Friday, but the main demonstration organised by the Communist and Green parties was not scheduled to begin until mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>The main centre-left opposition parties, who oppose the visit, said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the US soldiers who died in the liberation of Rome.</p>

<p>The US president's passage to his early morning appointments at the Vatican and the presidential Quirinale palace, where he paid a brief call to his Italian counterpart Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, were unimpeded as security forces outnumbered the early protesters.</p>

<p>Special trains from Venice and Naples carrying anti-war demonstrators to Rome were delayed by around 90 minutes in what many protesters felt was a deliberate ploy by the authorities to disrupt planned street protests.</p>

<p>Around 1,000 demonstrators arrived in Rome by train from Milan to join the street protests, rail authorities said.</p>

<p>"We're here to tell Bush he's really not welcome, but we want to say it with a peaceful demonstration," a youth with a megaphone said as the first marchers, many waving multicoloured peace flags, took to the streets in eastern Rome.</p>

<p>Closer to the centre, a group of young people set tyres ablaze on a bridge over the Tiber river.</p>

<p>Violence was confined to a few isolated incidents. In one, hooded youths launched a firework rocket at the front of a barracks housing Air Force personnel, while others blocked streets with smouldering rubbish skips.</p>

<p>There were no immediate reports of arrests.</p>

<p>Romans appeared to have stayed at home instead of braving major traffic disruption and the city appeared almost deserted in places.</p>

<p>Rome's public bus company Atac reported 50 percent fewer passengers compared to a normal Friday. "Romans have used their intelligence, or they prefered to remain at home, or they tried to get to work using alternative means."</p>
