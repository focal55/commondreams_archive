Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told senators Tuesday that 

he couldn't predict how long American troops would have to stay in Iraq or how 

large a force would be needed once the United States hands over sovereignty to 

an interim government.

<P>"The next year or year and a half will be so critical. That is the time 

it will take,'' Wolfowitz said, to establish an Iraqi security force 

sufficiently trained and supplied to take over the main work of providing 

security in a country where insurgent attacks have killed or wounded thousands 

of Americans over the past year.

<P>"We are looking at sustaining pretty high levels of U.S. forces, and 

certainly higher than we anticipated earlier, for some time,'' he said during 

3 1/2 hours of testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

<P>But senators from both parties, worried about the administration's 

faltering effort in Iraq, criticized Wolfowitz for a lack of specifics 

regarding the transfer of power scheduled for June 30 and accused him of not 

credibly laying out how quickly the Iraqis will be prepared to keep the peace 

in their country.

<P>About 135,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq, and the Pentagon has had to 

scramble to maintain such a large force, extending the stay of some forces and 

planning to move about 3,600 troops from South Korea. The attacks in Iraq 

continue, which American officials blame on elements of Saddam Hussein's 

deposed regime, foreign terrorists and disaffected Shiites, including the 

militia loyal to renegade cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.

<P>The Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal also has fueled anti-Americanism, 

making it even more vital in the Bush administration's view that the June 30 

handover proceed as scheduled, officials said. 

<P>Asked what mistake Bush administration planners had made leading up to 

the war and into its sometimes chaotic aftermath, Wolfowitz said that remnants 

of Hussein's regime had proved more resilient than expected.

<P>Wolfowitz said the shortcomings included the failure "to properly 

estimate that Saddam Hussein would still be out there funding attacks on 

Americans until he was captured; that one of his principal deputies, Izzat 

Ibrahim al-Douri, would still be out there funding operations against us; that 

they would have hundreds of millions of dollars in bank accounts in 

neighboring countries to support those operations''; and that Hussein's old 

intelligence service would keep fighting.

<P>Several committee members from both parties expressed skepticism that the 

turnover to an interim government would ease the dangerous situation U.S. 

forces face in Iraq.

<P>"My concern is, are we really leveling with the American people?'' asked 

Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio.

<P>"It seems to me that we ought to talk about what's the future going to be,

some rough estimates about the commitment that we're going to be making in 

terms of troops and the cost of it,'' he said.

<P>The main task for that new Iraqi government will be running the country's 

ministries day to day, in consultation with new U.S. Ambassador John 

Negroponte, and preparing for elections by the end of the year.

<P>Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who also testified before the 

Foreign Relations Committee, said 13 of 25 Iraqi government ministries that 

operate under the authority of the U.S.-run Coalition Provisional Authority 

are autonomous. However, even after June 30, 155 Americans will have influence 

in those ministries, serving as "liaison officers.''

<P>Armitage also said that Lakdhar Brahimi, the United Nations envoy charged 

with putting together Iraq's interim ruling body, would probably have a 

tentative list of those who would serve by the first week of June. 

<P>The U.N. Security Council will have to pass a new resolution before June 

30 to approve a new government because U.N. authority was granted for the 

United States to become the official occupying power in Iraq after Hussein was 

overthrown in April 2003. Armitage said negotiations on the resolution were 

proceeding smoothly.

<P>It's still not clear what the resolution will say about U.S. forces' 

power to imprison Iraqis and interrogate them, a particularly strong concern 

in light of the Abu Ghraib scandal. 

<P>Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said he couldn't understand why, in the wake of 

the prison scandal, the administration hadn't put the issue at the top of its 

agenda.

<P>"I would have thought that this government would put some time into this, 

especially with what we've just been through the last two weeks," Hagel said.

<P>A new U.N. resolution and a new interim government won't necessarily mean 

that the United States is any closer to pulling out its troops. Armitage said 

negotiators at the United Nations in New York were working on wording that 

would spell out exactly the rights and obligations of foreign forces in Iraq.

<P>Armitage said the United States realized its plans were likely to change 

as the situation in Iraq ebbed and flowed. "We've got a game plan, but we're 

going to have to call audibles,'' he said.

<P>Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said the June 30 plan faced a struggle in 

gaining credibility with the Iraqi people.

<P>"Iraqis will wake up July 1 with the transfer of sovereignty to people 

they don't know,'' said the committee's ranking Democrat. "They'll see about 

140,000 American troops and a new super-ambassador they suspect is pulling the 

strings.''

<P>Wolfowitz said it was vital to put Iraqis in charge of as much of their 

nation's internal security as possible. He said more than 200,000 Iraqis had 

been trained  --  at least in the basics  --  for service in civil defense 

units, in a new army or as police.

<P>Biden scoffed at Wolfowitz's claim, calling it "malarkey.''

<P>"There's no seriously trained Iraqi security force,'' Biden said, quoting 

Pentagon experts who he said had told him it would take three years to train 

40,000 Iraqi soldiers, and three to five years to prepare the 79,000 Iraqi 

police needed. 

<P>Wolfowitz conceded that some Iraqi civil defense units had performed 

poorly, such as those called in to fight al-Sadr's militia, but he said units 

in the northern city of Mosul had performed well in combat.

<P>"There will be very substantial Iraqi security forces by the end of this 

year ..." Wolfowitz said. "How much they will still need help from the United 

States is impossible to predict.'
