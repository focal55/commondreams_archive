WASHINGTON — Former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV says in a new book that he believes the White House official behind the disclosure of his wife's identity as an undercover C.I.A. officer was "quite possibly" I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff. But Mr. Wilson offers no firm evidence to support his assertion, and the White House has denied it.</p>
<P>
Mr. Wilson writes that Mr. Libby "evidently seized opportunities to rail openly against me" and was an "ardent neoconservative" who had the "motive and means" to conduct a covert inquiry to identify Mr. Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame. </p>
<P>
Her name was disclosed by Robert D. Novak in his syndicated column in July 2003 after Mr. Wilson publicly criticized the Bush administration's handling of reports that Iraq had tried to buy uranium from Niger, in Africa.     Federal prosecutors are investigating who gave Mr. Novak the information about Ms. Plame; disclosure of an undercover officer's identity can be a crime.</p>
<P>
The book, being published on Friday by Carroll & Graf, is titled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078671378X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's C.I.A. Identity — A Diplomat's Memoir</a>." </p>

The Plame-Novak controversy has its roots in  the State of the Union address in 2003 when Mr. Bush said that the British government had learned that Iraq had sought uranium in Africa, a possible indication of Saddam Hussein's interest in nuclear weapons.</p>
<P>
Mr. Wilson has said and recounts in the book that he knew that Mr. Bush's remark about Africa was wrong. Mr. Wilson  traveled to Niger in February 2002 at the C.I.A.'s request to investigate the assertion and concluded that it was false. The C.I.A. told him it had become involved because Mr. Cheney had asked whether there was any truth to the reports about Iraq's interest in Niger's uranium, the book said. The White House has maintained that Mr. Cheney did not learn about Mr. Wilson's trip until Mr. Wilson wrote an Op-Ed article about it for The New York Times last July 6.</p>
<P>
Mr. Bush's comment in the State of the Union address, Mr. Wilson writes, ignored two previous inquiries by Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick, an American ambassador to Niger, and Carleton Fulford, a Marine Corps  general, who also found that the Iraq-Niger story was not credible.</p>
<P>
Mr. Wilson writes that a  White House effort to damage him began at a March 2003 meeting called to develop a critique of him for the vice president's office. Citing an unnamed source "close to the House Judiciary Committee," Mr. Wilson writes that "either the vice president himself or, more likely, his chief of staff, Lewis (Scooter) Libby chaired a meeting at which a decision was made to do a work-up on me."</p>
<P>
Mr. Wilson writes that the meeting was attended by senior Republicans, possibly including Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. On Thursday, a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich, Rick Tyler, said Mr. Wilson's account was a "complete fabrication."</p>
<P>
Mr. Wilson says those in the meeting decided that "the strategy of the White House was to confront the issue as a `Wilson' problem rather than as an issue of the lie that was in the State of the Union address."</p>
<P>
As to the leaker, Mr. Wilson does not limit his suspicions to Mr. Libby. He says  another person whose name "has most often been repeated to me" is Elliott Abrams. Mr. Abrams is a former official in President Ronald Reagan's administration who became embroiled in the Iran-contra affair and now works in the National Security Council.</p>
<P>
Last year, Mr. Wilson identified Karl Rove, senior political adviser to Mr. Bush, as the probable  source of the leak, but he later backed off from that accusation. In the book, he writes that Mr. Rove circulated  information from the work-up on him within the administration.</p>
<P>
The White House has denied that Mr. Libby, Mr. Abrams or Mr. Rove were involved in the disclosure.</p>
<P>
Asked about Mr. Wilson's account, Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said he was "simply not going to review or promote a book whose author has said his primary purpose is to pursue a political agenda to defeat the president."</p>
<P>
Mr. Wilson is supporting Mr. Bush's Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, in the presidential race.</p>
<P>
Apart from the White House denials, the issue of how Mr. Novak obtained the information for his column has turned from an embarrassment into a serious legal matter. In December, after a preliminary three-month inquiry by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., Attorney General John Ashcroft referred the matter to Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney in Chicago.</p>
<P>
Mr. Fitzgerald has conducted a grand jury investigation into the disclosure as a special counsel, summoning several current and former White House aides to testify. No one has been charged.</p>
