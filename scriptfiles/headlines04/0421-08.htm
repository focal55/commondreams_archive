<p>UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said he saw no role for UN peacekeepers in Iraq, meaning the Security Council would have to approve an international force after Iraqis begin self-rule.  

<p>"There is need for assistance in the effort to create a secure environment," Annan said just hours after 68 people were killed in a series of car bombings in the southern Iraqi city of Basra.
 
<p>
 "Some international military presence is going to be required for the foreseeable future. I do not think it can be or ought to be UN peacekeepers. So the council may have to agree to allow a multinational force to do it."
 
<p>
 Security is a key concern for Annan, who has pledged to help Iraqis set up an interim government to take sovereignty from the US-led occupation by July 1 and prepare for Iraq's first post-Saddam Hussein  elections early next year.
 
<p>
 He pulled all international staff out of Iraq in October following a bombing at the UN's Baghdad offices which killed 22 people, including top UN envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.
 
<p>
 Faced with a serious escalation of violence in Iraq, the United States has turned to the United Nations for help in smoothing opposition to its plans for Iraq's future.
 
<p>
 But Annan again said any UN role in Iraq will be limited by the bloodshed, and recalled that an earlier council resolution allowed him to use his discretion concerning the return of UN staff.
 
<p>
 "We would like to play an important role in Iraq but the circumstances have to allow us to do that," he said. "We hope the attempts to reduce the violence will succeed. Until that is done, security is a constraint for us."
 
<p>
 He said the spread of violence to Basra, which has been relatively calm despite the bloodshed elsewhere in the country, was "not comforting" as the United Nations mulls how to proceed in Iraq.
 
<p>
"We have all been anxious to see the attempts to reduce violence succeed, not for it to spread. And of course, the security situation on the ground has a very important impact on our decisions."
