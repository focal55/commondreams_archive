VIENNA  - 

As U.S., British and U.N. experts were
busy disarming Libya, a shipment of nuclear bomb-related
machinery from Turkey slipped past Western intelligence
agencies into Libya in March, an atomic expert said on
Saturday.

<p>
 Libya, which swiftly disclosed the shipment, has also
denied purchasing nuclear materials from North Korea, casting
doubt on news reports Pyongyang secretly provided Tripoli with
uranium, diplomats close to the United Nations  said.
<p>
 David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector and
president of a U.S.-based security think-tank, told Reuters
this was a shining example of the "failure of export controls"
that enabled the creation of an illicit nuclear market.
<p>
 In a report issued on Friday and obtained by Reuters, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said:
<p>
 "One shipment of (centrifuge) components actually arrived
in Libya in March 2004, having escaped the attention of the
(Western) state authorities that had seized the cargo ship BBC
China in October 2003."
<p>
 "These components that arrived in March were assembled in
Turkey and sent to Libya via Dubai," the atomic energy expert,
who is familiar with the IAEA investigation and its new Libya
report, told Reuters.
<p>
 There was no suggestion that Libya, which has been
cooperating with U.N. inspectors, tried to hide the shipment.
The IAEA said: "Libya notified the agency of the arrival of
this container and it has since been shipped out of the
country."
<p>
 The work of dismantling Tripoli's atom bomb program by U.S.
and British experts in Libya was underway in March. But the
experts missed the shipment's arrival, diplomats said.
<p>
 A diplomat from an IAEA board member country said there may
be more such orders made before Libya renounced its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons programs in December that have
yet to reach Tripoli.
<p>
 U.S. and British intelligence officials arranged the
seizure in Italy of the BBC China while carrying centrifuge
components made in Malaysia to Libya via Dubai in the United
Arab Emirates.
<p>
 Turkey was first named as a player in a nuclear black
market linked to the father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons
program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, in a Malaysian police report based
on testimony of Buhary Syed Abu Tahir, a Sri Lankan
businessman.
<p>
 There were two Turkish men named in the police report. One
had worked for the German engineering firm Siemens .
<p>
 Malaysian authorities said on Friday they had arrested
Tahir. Washington said this was a key step in shutting down
Khan's network which stretched from Europe to Africa and across
the Middle East to Asia.
<p>
 NO TRADE WITH NORTH KOREA
<p>
 Separately, Western diplomats close to the IAEA said Libya
denied purchasing 1.6 tonnes of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) from
North Korea, which would have indicated the communist state was
selling nuclear material directly to states hungry for a bomb.
<p>
 UF6, a solid at room temperature, becomes a gas when heated
and can then be fed into gas centrifuges that enrich uranium
for use as fuel for atomic power plants or in weapons.
<p>
 "Libya has denied buying anything directly from North
Korea," one of the diplomats told Reuters.
<p>
 News reports about Libya's alleged direct trade with North
Korea said the IAEA had "strong evidence" for this claim based
on interviews with members of Khan's black market.
<p>
But diplomats said the IAEA has no strong evidence, only
second-hand testimony of persons interviewed by Pakistani
authorities given to the U.N. by Pakistan. The IAEA is taking
this information seriously but has no way of confirming it.
<p>
The diplomats said that the Libyans have generally been
cooperative and are considered trustworthy.
<p>
But these diplomats and the atomic expert said that even if
North Korea did not sell it directly to Libya, this did not
mean the uranium did not originate in North Korea.
<p>
They said it was possible the Pakistanis acted as
middlemen, buying the uranium from Pyongyang and reselling it
to Libya.
<p>
The Malaysian police report, released in February, said the
UF6 "was sent by air from Pakistan to Libya."
