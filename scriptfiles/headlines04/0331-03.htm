<p>FALLUJA, Iraq  - A crowd of cheering Iraqis  dragged the charred and mutilated bodies of four contractors  working for the U.S.-led coalition through the streets of  Falluja Wednesday after they died in an ambush.
<p> 
			
			In a separate attack five American soldiers were killed  when a roadside bomb was detonated beside their convoy west of  Baghdad, the U.S. army said.<p>

      Iraqis chant anti-American slogans as charred bodies hang from a bridge over the Euphrates River in Fallujah, west of Baghdad, Wednesday, March 31 2004. Enraged Iraqis in this hotbed of anti-Americanism killed four foreigners Wednesday, including at least one U.S. national, took the charred bodies from a burning SUV, dragged them through the streets, and hung them from the bridge.

The Falluja violence began when two four-wheel-drive  vehicles were attacked by guerrillas on a main road in the  town, 32 miles west of Baghdad. A crowd then set the vehicles  ablaze and hurled stones into the burning wreckage.<p> 
			
			Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, deputy director of  operations for the U.S. army in Iraq, said all four contractors  in the vehicles were killed. He did not give their  nationalities.<p> 
			
			Television pictures showed one incinerated body being  kicked and stamped on by a member of the jubilant crowd, while  others dragged a blackened body down the road by its feet.<p> 
			
			As one body lay burning on the ground, an Iraqi came and  doused it with petrol, sending flames soaring.<p> 
			
			At least two bodies were tied to cars and pulled through  the streets, witnesses said.<p> 
			
			"This is the fate of all Americans who come to Falluja,"  said Mohammad Nafik, one of the crowd surrounding the bodies.<p> 
			
			Some body parts were pulled off and left hanging from a  telephone cable, while two incinerated bodies were later strung  from a bridge and left dangling there.<p> 
			
			A young boy beat one of the incinerated bodies after it was  pulled down with his shoe as a crowd cheered.<p> 
			
			"I am happy to see this. The Americans are occupying us so  this is what will happen," said Mohammad, 12, looking on.<p> 
			
			As the victims lay burning, a crowd of around 150 men  chanted "Long live Islam" and "Allahu Akbar" ("God is  Greatest") while flashing victory signs.<p> 
			
			No U.S. soldiers or Iraqi police were seen in the area for  hours after the attack, but a U.S. fighter plane screamed  overhead, prompting the crowd to scatter.<p> 
			
			Falluja has been one of the most violent, restive towns in  Iraq since the U.S.-led occupation began. There are almost  daily attacks on U.S. military convoys in the area.<p> 
			
			FOREIGNERS TARGETED<p> 
			
			More than 400 U.S. soldiers have been killed in action  since the start of the war, many of them in attacks using  improvised explosive devices in which an explosive charge is  hidden in a plastic bag, soft drink can or dead animal and  wired to a simple detonator.<p> 
			
			As well as attacks on U.S. and coalition troops, there has  been a sharp increase in insurgent strikes against foreign  civilians in recent weeks.<p> 
			
			In March alone, 12 foreign civilians have been killed in  drive-by shootings or similar attacks. In the most recent  incident, a Briton and a Canadian, both working as security  guards, were shot and killed Sunday in the city of Mosul.<p> 
			
			Earlier in March, two Finns were killed in Baghdad, and  four U.S. missionaries were shot dead in Mosul. In Hilla, south  of Baghdad, two Americans working for the U.S. civilian  authority were shot in a drive-by shooting.<p> 
			
			With less than 100 days to go before U.S. authorities hand  over sovereignty to an Iraqi government, the U.S. military,  Iraqi police and other local security forces are still battling  to bring security to the country.<p> 
			
			Attacks occur almost every day with rockets, grenades,  assault rifles, small arms or suicide bombs somewhere in Iraq.<p> 
			
			Wednesday, a suicide bomber detonated his car in Baquba,  about 25 miles north of Baghdad, wounding around a dozen  people. Tuesday a suicide car bomber attacked the house of the  chief of police in Hilla, but killed only himself.
