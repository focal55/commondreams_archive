<I>SUMMARY: The conservative American Family Association will not take the results of its marriage poll to Capitol Hill after a majority of respondents favored same-sex marriage.</I>
<p>
 The conservative American Family Association (AFA) said it will not take the results of its marriage poll to Capitol Hill after a majority of respondents favored same-sex marriage, according to a Thursday report in Wired News.</p>

 <p>
 The AFA posted the poll online in December with a stated intention to forward the results to Congress as evidence of U.S. opposition to same-sex marriage. Respondents could select one of these three choices: </p>

 <p>
 <ul>
   <li>" I favor legalization of homosexual marriage." <br>
   </li>
   <li>"I favor a 'civil union' with the full benefits of marriage except for the name."<br>
   </li>
   <li>"I oppose legalization of homosexual marriage and 'civil unions.'" </li>
 </ul>
 <p></p>

 <p>
 But as of press time, the numbers support same-sex unions: Sixty percent favored same-sex marriage and 8 percent favored civil unions, leaving just 32 percent opposed. </p>

 <p>
 AFA representative Buddy Smith complained to Wired News: "It just so happens that homosexual activist groups around the country got a hold of the poll -- it was forwarded to them -- and they decided to have a little fun, and turn their organizations around the country (on to) the poll to try to cause it to represent something other than what we wanted it to. And so far, they succeeded with that." </p>

 <p>
 Matt Foreman, the Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce was dumbfounded. "The abject hypocrisy of these people never ceases to amaze me," he exclaimed. </p>

 <p>
 "They constantly manipulate facts, and when things don't work out as they want, they run to mama and whine."</p>

 <p>
 On Jan. 6, the Gay.com/PlanetOut.com Network discussed the AFA poll with expert Bob Witeck, who said that since it was not a scientific survey, its results could not be considered meaningful data. According to Witeck, legitimate polls show support for gay marriage somewhere between 40 to 50 percent -- and growing. </p>
