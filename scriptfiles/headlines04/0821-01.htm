<p>WASHINGTON - Three U.S. senators have called on Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to account for 8.8 billion dollars entrusted to 
the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in Iraq earlier this year but now 
gone missing.
 
					  <p>
					  
					  In a letter Thursday, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Byron L Dorgan of North 
Dakota and Tom Harkin of Iowa, all opposition Democrats, demanded a "full, 
written account" of the money that was channeled to Iraqi ministries and 
authorities by the CPA, which was the governing body in the occupied 
country until Jun. 30.
<p>
The loss was uncovered in an audit by the CPA's inspector general. It has 
not yet been released publicly and was initially reported on the website of 
journalist and retired U.S. Army Col David Hackworth.
<p>
The CPA was terminated at the end of July to make way for an interim Iraqi 
government, which is in turn scheduled to be replaced by an elected body 
early in 2005.
<p>
"We are requesting a full, written account of the 8.8 billion dollars 
transferred earlier this year from the CPA to the Iraqi ministries, 
including the amount each ministry received and the way in which the 
ministry spent the money," said the letter.
<p>
The senators also requested that the Pentagon designate a date by which it 
will install adequate oversight and financial and contractual controls over 
money it spends in Iraq.
<p>
They accused the CPA of transferring the "staggering sum of money" with no 
written rules or guidelines to ensure adequate control over it.
<p>
They pointed to "disturbing findings" from the inspector general's report 
that the payrolls of some Iraqi ministries, then under CPA control, were 
padded with thousands of ghost employees. They refer to an example in which 
CPA paid the salaries of 74,000 security guards although the actual number 
of employees could not be validated.
<p>
The report says that in one case some 8,000 guards were listed on a payroll 
but only 603 real individuals could be counted.
<p>
"Such enormous discrepancies raise very serous questions about potential 
fraud, waste and abuse," added the letter.
<p>
This is not the first time that U.S. financial conduct in Iraq has come 
under fire, specifically over funds slated for reconstruction after the 
U.S.-led attack in March 2003, which then went unaccounted for.
<p>
In June, British charity Christian Aid said at least 20 billion dollars in 
oil revenues and other Iraqi funds intended to rebuild the country have 
disappeared from banks administered by the CPA.
<p>
Watchdog groups have complained before about the opaque nature of the CPA's 
handling of Iraqi money and the lack of transparency of U.S. and Iraqi 
officials.
<p>
Halliburton, a giant U.S. company that has been awarded 8.2 billion dollars 
worth of contracts from the Defense department to provide support services 
such as meals, shelter, laundry and Internet connections for U.S. soldiers 
in Iraq, has been targeted for allegedly overcharging for those services.
<p>
"Continued failures to account for funds, such as the 8.8 billion dollars 
of concern here - and the refusal, so far, of the Pentagon to take 
corrective action are a disservice to the American taxpayer, the Iraqi 
people and to our men and women in uniform," the senators wrote.
<p>
Groups critical of the lack of transparency in the CPA's spending have been 
particularly angry that the authority used Iraqi money to pay for 
questionable contracts -- some awarded without a public tendering process 
-- with U.S. companies.
<p>
Washington initially restricted the most lucrative reconstruction contracts 
in Iraq to gigantic U.S. firms that appeared able to reap huge profits, 
fueling accusations the Bush administration was seeking to benefit a 
select few U.S. companies rather than find the best, and possibly the 
cheapest, options to help rebuild Iraq.
<p>
After loud complaints, the contracting process was officially opened to 
firms from other nations, but many of them still insist they are not 
competing on a level playing field with U.S. businesses.
<p>
A Pentagon spokeswoman told IPS that the CPA administered the money 
transparently and that Iraqi ministries used the eight billion dollars in 
ways that directly "benefited the people of Iraq."
<p>
"The CPA provided these funds to Iraqi ministries from the Development Fund 
for Iraq through a transparent and open budget process," said Lt Col 
Rose-Ann L Lynch of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Public Affairs. "This is Iraqi money -- revenue from such sources as oil 
sales -- not U.S. funds."
<p>
The official added that the money was used to pay the salaries of hundreds 
of thousands of government employees, teachers, health workers, 
administrators and government pensioners, as well as to fund the Iraqi 
Defense ministry and police forces.
