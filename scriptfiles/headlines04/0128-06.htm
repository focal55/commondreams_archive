<p>WASHINGTON  - The U.S. military is making plans  for an offensive that would reach inside Pakistan in coming  months to try to destroy operations of Osama bin Laden's al  Qaeda network, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0401280334jan28,1,901552,print.story?coll=chi-news-hed" target="_new">the Chicago Tribune reported</a> on Wednesday.

<!--/endimage/-->The newspaper, in a report from Washington citing military  sources, said the plans involved thousands of U.S. troops, some  of them already in neighboring Afghanistan.<p> 
			
							The Pakistani government denied to Reuters that it would  allow such an operation and the Pentagon declined to confirm  that such a plan was being worked on.<p> 
			
							The Chicago Tribune said the plans were advanced but their  execution would depend on events on the ground.<p> 
			
							This was "not like a contingency plan for North Korea,  something that sits on a shelf. This planning is like planning  for Iraq. They want this plan to be executable -- now," one  source was quoted as saying.<p> 
			
							Such an intervention would be political dynamite for  Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who has only allowed  a very limited U.S. military presence in his country. He has  cooperated with Washington against al Qaeda but is under  pressure from Islamic parties at home.<p> 
			
							The newspaper said the U.S. plans were driven partly by  concerns over two assassination attempts last month against  Musharraf, whose cooperation has been vital to U.S.  anti-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan and who is seen in  Washington as a force for stability in the volatile region.
							<p> 
			
							The plans were also prompted by a resurgence of attacks by  the Taliban, which governed Afghanistan and harbored al Qaeda  leaders until it was driven from power in a 2001 U.S.-led  invasion.
							<p> 
			
							CONCERN FOR MUSHARRAF<p> 
			
							A U.S. defense official would not confirm the specific  operation mentioned in the report, citing a policy against  discussing future operations. The official did say that the  attempts on Musharraf's life had raised concerns among U.S.  authorities.<p> 
			
							The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told  Reuters U.S. forces staged operations along the Afghan-Pakistan  border "all the time," and the American troops in Afghanistan  had an "ongoing" offensive against al Qaeda and Taliban  remnants.<p> 
			
							The Chicago Tribune, quoting sources who requested  anonymity, said a team of military intelligence officers would  go in to Pakistan ahead of time to prepare an operation which  would involve Special Operations forces, Army Rangers and  ground troops and an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.<p> 
			
							The operation is being called "spring offensive" in  internal Pentagon messages and a series of planning orders were  issued in recent weeks, the newspaper said.<p> 
			
							At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on  Friday Musharraf rejected the need for U.S. forces to enter  Pakistan to search for bin Laden. Pakistan's top military  spokesman echoed that on Wednesday.<p> 
			
							"No foreign forces will operate from Pakistan's territory,"  Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan told Reuters when asked about the  Tribune's report.<p> 
			
							But a military source described as "well-placed" told the  newspaper: "Before we were constrained by the border. Musharraf  did not want that. Now we are told we're going into Pakistan  with Musharraf's help."<p> 
			
							Musharraf said last week that bin Laden and his followers  likely were still hiding in the mountains along the Afghan  border. He also said he was reasonably sure al Qaeda was behind  the attempts on his life.
