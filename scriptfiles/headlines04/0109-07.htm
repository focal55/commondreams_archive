<!--/endimage/-->WASHINGTON   - US President George W. Bush  led cabinet meetings "like a blind man in a room full of deaf people," former Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill said in portions of a television interview. 


<p>O'Neill, whom Bush fired in December 2002, explained that there was a lack of dialogue between the president and his top aides, either as a group or individually, CBS reported on its Internet site. 


<p>The former insider told the network in an interview to be broadcast January 11 that the president asked him no questions during their first one-on-one meeting. 


<p>"I went in with a long list of things to talk about and, I thought, to engage (him) on. ... I was surprised it turned out me talking and the president just listening. ... It was mostly a monologue," O'Neill was quoted as saying. 


<p>The interview came after O'Neill served as the main source for an upcoming book, "The Price of Loyalty," which paints an insider's view of the Bush administration, the network said. 
<p>White House spokesman Scott McClellan deflected repeated questions about O'Neill's assertions, saying: "I don't do book reviews."
