NEW YORK - MoveOn.org, a grass-roots group that promotes liberal causes from its Web site, is reaching out beyond the Internet to the more traditional medium of books with a political how-to guide for local activists.
<p> 
"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/193072229X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">MoveOn's 50 Ways to Love Your Country</a>," to be published on April 1 by the small, independent Inner Ocean Publishing of Hawaii, was fourth on the Amazon.com list on Wednesday even though a promotional push for the book by group members had barely begun.
<p> 
The book represents a "crossing of the digital divide" by moving from the Internet into bookstores that often serve as community centers, said the book's publisher, Karen Bouris, in a telephone interview from her office on the island of Maui.
<p> 
MoveOn has attracted more than 2 million members and raised millions of dollars to back political campaigns and projects.
<p> 
Sections of the book are introduced by former Vice President Al Gore, California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi and author Gail Sheehy. The essays share personal experiences and practical advice ranging from "Write an Op-Ed Letter" to "Start a Petition," which chronicles a couple's quest to protect endangered wolves in Alaska.
<p> 
"It's about participating in our democracy in a positive way, not bashing," Bouris said. "The more informed, the more we feel our voices and actions can and do make a difference, the better country we'll have."
<p> 
Local MoveOn members will host about 100 promotional events at bookstores across the country over the next two months starting with a March 30 launch at Broadside Bookshop in Northampton, Massachusetts.
<p> 
Each event is organized locally, with volunteers arranging readings or leading town hall-style discussions on community issues, Inner Ocean publicity manager Katie McMillan said.
<p> 
"A lot of the stores have gone out and gotten outside venues because there are big enough local MoveOn membership that they won't fit everyone in the stores," said McMillan.
<p> 
Bouris, herself a MoveOn member, was a catalyst for the project, brainstorming two years ago with group co-founder Joan Blades about a book to galvanize people politically, while the two walked Blades' dog in Berkeley, California.
<p> 
"The book has been put together democratically. They put out a call out for submissions. It is an amazing reflection of the people's voices. That's where the power lies," Bouris said.
