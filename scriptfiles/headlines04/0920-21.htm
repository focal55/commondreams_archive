Both the Iraqi government and the US military are desperate to pacify Falluja ahead of national elections scheduled for January, but the task looks ever harder.  <P>In June the second most senior US military officer in Iraq, Lieutenant General Thomas Metz, told the Guardian he planned that by September or October most of Iraq would be under "local control", patrolled and policed by Iraqi security forces, not the US military.  <P>Yet since June the insurgency has grown and now controls huge chunks of western Sunni Iraq, around the insurgent bastion of Falluja. Local control, particularly in these areas, seems further away than ever.  <div id="OvertureDivHolder"><div id="OvertureDiv"></div></div><P>Earlier this month Gen Metz told the Associated Press that a major offensive was coming, either against Falluja or one of the other trouble spots in Iraq, including Sadr City, the Shia   slums in eastern Baghdad.  <P>Yesterday a senior US military officer was quoted in the New York Times as saying that an attack on Falluja was likely. "We need to make a decision on when the cancer of Falluja is going to be cut out," the US commander said. "We would like to end December at local control across the country. Falluja will be tough."  <P>However, there is little guarantee that any fight would succeed.  <P>An offensive led by the US marines against Falluja in April was a failure. At least 600 Iraqis were killed and footage of the dead and dying inflamed opinion across the country. Dozens of marines were also killed and the attack was called off after three weeks before the centre of the city was taken. The insurgents emerged stronger than ever.  <P>Ayad Allawi, the Iraqi prime minister, has little constituency in Iraq and relies heavily on the support of the US military.  <P>The cost in political capital of another full-scale assault on Falluja may be too much for him to bear at the moment.   <P>Mr Allawi admitted last week that he has been negotiating hard with people from Falluja to try to avoid a confrontation.  <P>Similar negotiations in the insurgent stronghold of Samarra bore some fruit two weeks ago when the US military entered the town for the first time in weeks and began to restore a local government. Each time the government has offered millions of dollars in reconstruction funds if the insurgents leave or lay down their arms.  <P>Yet such talks often fail. Yesterday similar negotiations over the future of Sadr City, in Baghdad, broke down, paving the way for a return to the guerrilla warfare that gripped the area throughout the summer.  <P>Falluja, like most of Iraq, has seen little of the billions of reconstruction dollars pledged by the west and that in itself has motivated militants to fight.  <P>Mr Allawi and the American generals must now decide whether a second assault on Falluja can really pacify Iraq's burgeoning insurgency.
