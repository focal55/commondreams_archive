<p>LONDON - Parliamentarians will table a motion on  Wednesday demanding a debate on Prime Minister Tony Blair's  "gross misconduct" in leading Britain to war against Iraq.
<p> 
			
			The impeachment motion, the first one to be tabled since  the mid-19th century, has been signed by 23 members of  parliament (MPs) from various opposition parties.<p> 
			
			But even if a debate is granted, any attempt to accuse  Blair of "high crimes and misdemeanors" is doomed to fail in  the elected House of Commons, where his Labour party has a  majority of more than 150 seats.<p> 
			
			"We must make a stand or watch the democracy that we have  fought for so often against foreign enemies be subverted from  within," Welsh nationalist MP Adam Price said.<p> 
			
			"The rules of constitutional conduct have been brushed  aside. The cabinet table has been replaced with the sofa ...  and the facts replaced with 'belief'."<p> 
			
			Price started a campaign during the summer to have Blair  impeached, unveiling a 99-page report titled "A Case to Answer"  that set out the legal case.<p> 
			
			Sources in his party, Plaid Cymru, said they would be  pressing for a full parliamentary debate in January.<p> 
			
			After months of denial, Blair admitted earlier this year  that intelligence information he used to make a case for war,  which said Saddam Hussein had banned weapons ready to use, had  turned out to be wrong.<p> 
			
			Famous figures including playwright Harold Pinter,  novelists Iain Banks and Frederick Forsyth, and actor Corin  Redgrave will attend an event in parliament on Wednesday to  publicize the motion.<p> 
			
			Blair can rest assured that he will not face the ultimate  sanction of removal from office.<p> 
			
			But the bid will embarrass the premier, drawing renewed  attention to an issue that has dogged him since the war last  year hammered his public trust ratings.<p> 
			
			The motion calls for a committee of MPs to be appointed to  investigate and report to the Commons within 48 days.<p> 
			
			It would be the first time the ancient parliamentary power  of impeachment has been used in Britain since a failed attempt  to prosecute a foreign secretary in the mid-19th century.
