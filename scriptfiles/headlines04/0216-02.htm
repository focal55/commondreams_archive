<p>Stephen Pirak and Chris Hackett of Santa Rosa were supposed to spend 
Sunday night at the luxurious Fairmont Hotel under a warm, fluffy comforter. 
Instead, they camped out in the rainy, winter night on a cold, hard slab of 
concrete outside San Francisco's City Hall with just a thin Powerpuff Girls 
blanket.
<P>Partners for 12 years, they wanted to be sure they would be one of the 
few hundred same-sex couples who would be married today at San Francisco City 
Hall. By 9:30 p.m. Sunday more than 130 couples had lined up, and the line was 
still growing into the night.

  </table></font><!--/endimage/-->"We were going to come early in the morning, but we saw all the people 
camping out so we thought we should stay," said Pirak.
<P>Today may be the last day of a marriage frenzy that began Thursday when 
Mayor Gavin Newsom directed city officials to begin issuing marriage licenses 
to gay and lesbian couples. Since then hundreds of same-sex couples have 
trooped through City Hall to take advantage of the opportunity.
<P>Opponents of same-sex marriage, who have filed suit against the city, 
said they will return to court Tuesday to seek a temporary restraining order 
to stop the weddings. 
<P>But those camped outside City Hall on Sunday night said it was worth the 
wait even if the licenses are eventually invalidated.
<P>"We will have been married and we will have the certificate to prove it. 
If it doesn't take right now, it is a beginning," said Debra Arbuckle, 51, of 
Alameda, who has been with her partner, Sherry Stoll, 46, for almost 23 years.
<P>Rick Tuscany, 37, a painting contractor from Monterey who was first in 
line with his partner, Rich Chapin, 50, said he arrived at 8 a.m. Sunday.
<P>"I sat in line for Pink Floyd tickets all night. Why wouldn't I sit in 
line for marriage?" he said. "If we don't get married now, it may never happen.
We've been together 15 years. We have raised a family. That's why we don't 
understand why we even have to stand in this line. But if this is what we have 
to do to push on, we are going to be here." 
<P>San Francisco Deputy Assessor-Recorder Minna Tao implored the couples to 
go home and come back in the morning, saying that the weather would be 
dangerously cold. She said the city had processed weddings for 460 couples on 
Sunday  --  bringing the total to about 1,700 since Thursday  --  and expected 
to do even more than that daily record on Monday. But not one person budged.
<P>"It just goes to show you what we have to go through, and then you have 
Britney Spears who just did it in a few minutes," said Garret Villalba, 42, 
who drove to San Francisco on Friday from Santa Barbara with his partner of 18 
years, Robert Kratzke, also 42. "It is hard when you go to other people's 
weddings and you almost feel a little angry because you can't get married." 
<P>Villalba and Kratzke had a hotel room, but after two days of not getting 
into City Hall they left their two dogs to enjoy the warm room and camped out 
for the night.
<P>By early evening, the line was snaking around the corner from the City 
Hall entrance on Dr. Carlton Goodlett Place to the middle of Grove Street.
<P>Although temperatures were expected to dip into the 40s during the night 
and it was raining intermittently, the atmosphere in the line was festive. 
Lying near many couples were wilting flower bouquets they had expected to use 
during ceremonies on Sunday. New friends held spaces as others ran off to get 
food, use the bathroom or warm up and made plans to get together in a year for 
their shared anniversary.
<P>Many of those who staked out a spot in the overnight line had tried for 
days to get married. But the line of aspiring spouses outside City Hall has 
been more than officials could handle.
<P>Couples were coming from as far as Africa to get hitched on Valentine's 
weekend, according to Joe Caruso, director of the Office of Neighborhood 
Services, who himself had married 117 couples since Thursday.
<P>By 3:50 p.m. Sunday, 200 couples  --  some waiting since 10 a.m.  --  
were turned away and told to come back today. A system of handing out numbers 
to those still waiting Saturday left few spots for those showing up Sunday, 
and officials said they were sticking to a first-come first serve process 
Monday.
<P>Many volunteers were city employees who donated their time  --  some as 
long as 13-hour days  --  to process the mounds of paper accumulating in city 
offices accustomed to processing only 30 marriages a day.
<P>"Their long weekend is gone  --  their Valentine's Day is gone," Caruso 
said from his City Hall office, as about 100 couples waited in line to 
purchase their marriage licenses.
<P>For many of the 1,400 gay and lesbian couples who passed through City 
Hall over the weekend, their marriages bore a political meaning as much as a 
personal one.
<P>"I don't believe anyone should be denied the right to marry the person 
they choose and the person they love," said Curtis McAdams, 42, of Austin, 
Texas, who tied the knot with David Miller, 34, after 10 years together. 
<P>They said they plan to file a lawsuit to be recognized as married in 
Texas.
<P>Miller and McAdams served as witnesses for Cynthia Rickert, 36 and Michie 
Wong, 41, who were making their fifth political statement when they married 
Sunday.
<P>The couple registered as domestic partners twice  --  in San Francisco in 
1995 and again with the state in 2003  --  and have had two commitment 
ceremonies in their decade together.
<P>"Everybody has a right to love each other," Rickert said. "It's a civil 
rights issue. It's time for us to get off the back of the bus."
<P>As they watched Rickert and Wong become officially married, another 
couple, Richard Rodriguez and Dave Moore struggled to hide their 
disappointment that they "were stuck with domestic partner" status.
<P>Both Rodriguez and Moore are HIV-positive. They had planned to be in San 
Francisco only one day, and had not brought enough medication to wait in line 
an extra day.
<P>But as Rodriguez guided another lesbian couple into the City Hall rotunda 
to exchange vows, a city official approached him. Apparently, a local couple 
heard about Rodriguez and Moore and gave up their place in line.
<P>Rodriguez happily left his volunteer post for a place in the hours-long 
line for a marriage license.
<P>As the two stood in the City Hall rotunda, in jeans and sweaters, 
Rodriguez placed the gold and titanium ring on Moore's left hand and looked up 
at him: "With this ring, I thee wed."

City Hall schedule
<P>The assessor's office anticipates being able to process more than 460 
same-sex marriage licenses and ceremonies today between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. 
Many of the applicants camped outside the building overnight.
<P>On Tuesday, regular weekday business processing hours resume (8 a.m. to 4 
p.m.) with license and ceremonies on a first-come, first-served basis.
<P>You do not need to be a California resident to marry in California.
