DIWANIYAH, Iraq (AFP) - US Sergeant Matt Decker told the gunner atop his armoured vehicle to kill anyone found with heavy weapons. And as they set off on patrol he expressed his hope for a firefight to break the tedium of their long stay in Iraq. 
<p>
 
"My briefing is simple: you see anyone with an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade), line 'em up," he told the gunner at the start of a night patrol of the dark, dusty streets of Diwaniyah, 180 kilometers (110 miles) south of Baghdad.
 <p>
   <p>
 "When you've been here this long, it gets kind of boring," he told an AFP reporter during the uneventful patrol. "I wouldn't mind drawing fire."
 <p>
   <p>
 After all, he said, the reason the men of the 1st Armored Division are still in Iraq weeks after they were initially due to head home is to hunt down the militia of firebrand Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr.
 <p>
   <p>
 Decker and his men have been involved in fierce clashes with the militiamen in the holy city of Najaf where Sadr is holed up in a mosque, and have also faced some firefights in Diwaniyah.
 <p>
   <p>
 The 1st AD only recently moved from Baghdad to central Iraq to battle Sadr's Mehdi Army and to replace Spanish troops after the new government in Madrid decided to end their deployment to Iraq.
 <p>
   <p>
 Before that, the men of the US division were preparing to leave for Kuwait, and then home, after spending a year in Iraq.
 <p>
   <p>
 Soldiers of the 1st AD's 3-2 squadron say they only learned of the new plans one week before their scheduled April 26 departure.
 <p>
   <p>
 
"It sucks," one soldier said, echoing the words on just about everyone's lips at the squadron's Wolfpack camp in Diwaniyah.
 <p>
   <p>
 
"My first reaction? It's crap," said Decker, from Lawrence, Kansas.
 <p>
   <p>
 "It's disheartening, but there's nothing we can do about it."
 <p>
   <p>
 For the first few days soldiers engaged in some serious grumbling, "but now we're over it and we just get on with our jobs," said Decker.
 <p>
   <p>
 Sergeant First Class Paul Ninelist said the hardest part was telling his wife and seven-year-old son he would be in Iraq a little longer.
 <p>
   <p>
 His wife "took it real rough" and his son didn't really understand what it was all about.
 <p>
   <p>
 Like most of the soldiers, Ninelist is not really enthusiastic about spending more time in Iraq, particularly as the scorching summer months approach, but he too believes the job needs to be finished.
 <p>
   <p>
 "When I first heard about it, it pissed me off. But we are here for a reason, to create a free Iraq, so all the guys who died didn't die in vain," he said.
 <p>
   <p>
 No one is quite sure when the soldiers will head home, though rumours in the camp are rife and suggest it could be any time between July and September.
 <p>
   <p>
 In the meantime, Decker patrols the streets of Diwaniyah, searching for anything suspicious and hoping for some action.
