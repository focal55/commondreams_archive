<b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b>
</p>
<p>
For a former college drop-out from Ontario and, briefly, a lineman stringing up telegraph wires on the railways of Canada, Graydon Carter, 55, has risen to impressive heights. The editor of <I>Vanity Fair</I> since 1992 &#173; after succeeding Tina Brown &#173; he is one of America's celebrity editors with clout, glamour and a nice line in suits.
</p>
<p>
It is hard to imagine Carter doing physical work of any kind, beyond exercising his thumb on his silver Zippo lighter. His labor is restricted to rejigging headlines in his magazine &#173; he is a self-confessed failure at delegation of duties &#173; and swanning to Manhattan parties. Martini in hand, he cuts an almost princely and dandyish figure, with billowing shirts and similarly billowing silver hair.
</p>
<p>
The spotlight on his activities has never burned brighter. In recent months he has transformed the regular editor's letter at the front of the magazine into less of a chat about its coming contents &#173; the spreads of Annie Leibowitz and rants of Christopher Hitchens &#173; and more a full-bore diatribe against the world of George Bush.
