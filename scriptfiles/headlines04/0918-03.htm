<p>The bitterness and bad feelings left from 2000's nasty, monthlong 
dispute over Florida's presidential vote could explode into election day chaos 
this November as both major parties get ready to fight that battle again, 
anywhere in the country.
<P>Democrats boast of having 10,000 attorneys ready to deal with any 
election law violations on Nov. 2, while Republicans want to have bipartisan 
teams of observers in every precinct where problems could occur. Various other 
groups, some linked to the parties and some not, also vow to do whatever it 
takes to keep the election clean.
<P>Democrats and Republicans know that George W. Bush's 537-vote victory in 
the state made him president, which is a constant reminder of just how 
important each vote can be.
<P>"We are very prepared, very aggressive,'' Terry McAuliffe, head of the 
Democratic National Committee, said after the party convention in Boston. 
"There are people who felt that the Democrats didn't fight hard enough (in 
2000). ... That's not going to happen.''
<P>There's a growing concern that the 2004 election will be close enough to 
be stolen, and neither side has been shy about pointing fingers.
<P>"You have falsely and unfairly charged the Republican Party with trying 
to intimidate voters,'' Republican Party Chairman Ed Gillespie said in a June 
15 letter to McAuliffe. "The other side of the coin is that just as Democrats 
apparently believe that Republicans are engaged in voter intimidation, many in 
my party believe Democrats engineer voter fraud.''
<P>With the 2004 election likely hanging on a handful of votes in a handful 
of states, each party already is complaining about the other's hardball 
tactics. In July, 13 Democratic members of Congress, including Mike Honda of 
San Jose and Barbara Lee of Oakland, signed a letter asking the United Nations 
to send international observers to states like Florida to monitor the November 
election.
<P>In Michigan, Democrats were outraged when Republican state Rep. John 
Pappageorge was quoted in July as warning that if "we do not suppress the 
Detroit vote, we're going to have a tough time in this election.'' Detroit, 
where the population is 83 percent black, regularly votes Democratic.
<P>In states like South Dakota and Iowa, Republicans have complained that 
Democrats have been playing games with absentee votes, signing up people 
without their knowledge and manipulating the absentees to add to their vote 
totals.
<P>Both parties also worry about the safety of new voting technology. 
<P>Democrats wondered just what it meant when the chief executive of Diebold,
a leading manufacturer of touch-screen voting terminals, said in a GOP fund-
raising letter last year that he was "committed to helping Ohio deliver its 
electoral votes to the president.''
<P>But in last month's Florida primary, Republican Party officials urged 
Miami voters to use absentee ballots, warning that there was no way to verify 
their votes on the touch-screen machines.
<P>There are plenty of other voting concerns. 
<P>Missouri, for example, is allowing military people stationed overseas to 
vote via e-mail. By doing so, however, they would give up their right to a 
secret ballot, since military and local election officials handling the e-mail 
would be able to see how they voted.
<P>In Florida, voting officials dropped plans to purge the registration 
rolls of 47,000 felons when a study by the Miami Herald showed that more than 
2,100 on that list  --  62 percent of them Democrats  --  had had their voting 
rights restored.
<P>South Dakota has a new law requiring voters to provide a photo ID or 
signed affidavit at the polls, following charges of voting irregularities in 
the 2002 Senate race.
<P>In that contest, GOP Rep. John Thune lost by 524 votes to incumbent Sen. 
Tim Johnson after a surprisingly heavy Democratic turnout by Native American 
voters. While Thune, who is running against Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle in 
November, never called for a recount, columnist and CNN commentator Robert 
Novak echoed many South Dakota Republicans when he charged earlier this year 
that "the election was stolen by stuffing ballot boxes on Indian reservations."
<P>While concerns about election day hanky panky drift around the fringe of 
every campaign, those worries are multiplied in the tight race between Bush 
and Democratic Sen. John Kerry. 
<P>It wasn't just Florida that was a toss-up in 2000. In New Mexico, 
Democrat Al Gore won the state by only 365 votes. The winner's margin was 
fewer than 7,200 votes in Iowa, New Hampshire, Oregon and Wisconsin. 
<P>At San Francisco's Yerba Buena Gardens last weekend, nearly 1,000 people 
spent a warm afternoon listening to horror stories about people being kept out 
of voting booths. They signed up to act as poll watchers in battleground 
states such as Florida, Arizona and New Mexico.
<P>"In the Aug. 31 primary in Florida, we saw poll workers asking people for 
ID when the law says they don't need to show it,'' said Becky Bond of Working 
Assets, one of the groups sponsoring the Election Protection program. "There 
was a police vehicle parked near the entrance to the polling place in one 
Latino community.''
<P>San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom joined the crowd at the afternoon event. 
A couple of weeks ago, Newsom met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights 
activist and former Democratic presidential candidate, and heard about the 
problems minority voters still face in some states.
<P>"I'm concerned about what's going on, not in the state of California but 
around the country,'' Newsom said. "People don't realize the disparities that 
exist in the different states.''
<P>Although Election Protection is billed as a nonpartisan group, there 
weren't many Bush supporters at an event sponsored by left-leaning 
organizations like People for the American Way, Mother Jones magazine and 
Working Assets.
<P>Volunteers wearing black T-shirts saying "You Have the Right to Vote" 
will be using their own money to travel to states where voting rights 
violations have occurred, said Bond. They'll spend the days before the 
election working to get out the vote, and then monitor polling places on Nov. 
2. 
<P>While intimidation and illegal election tactics are a concern, voter 
education is at least as important, she said. Working Assets has joined with 
other groups to register 1 million new voters for November, and many of them 
aren't familiar with voting procedures or their rights at the polls.
<P>"We want to go where we're needed most on election day and let voters 
know what they can do,'' Bond said.</p>
