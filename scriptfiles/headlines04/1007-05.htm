<p>CHERBOURG, France - A heavily guarded convoy of  vehicles believed to be transporting U.S. weapons-grade  plutonium left a plant in northern France on Thursday for a  recycling factory 660 miles southeast.<p>

French state-owned nuclear energy firm Areva, whose Cogema  unit will recycle the plutonium into nuclear fuel, declined to  confirm the content of the convoy that witnesses saw leave the  La Hague plant in the early hours of the morning.<p> 
			
			Environmental activists are worried about the safety of the  shipment which arrived in the port of Cherbourg Wednesday after  a more than two-week journey from Charleston in the United  States. They fear it is vulnerable to terrorist attack.<p> 
			
			"This is a high-risk strategy being played by the nuclear  industry with the lives of millions of people," said Shaun  Burnie of Greenpeace International.<p> 
			
			A Reuters photographer said that a convoy of several dozen  trucks, cars and buses left the La Hague plant at around 4:30  a.m.<p> 
			
			Police were guarding all bridges on the convoy's route to  the Cadarache plant in southeastern France, where the plutonium  will be recycled into nuclear fuel.<p> 
			
			This will then be shipped back to the United States for use  in an electricity-generating reactor.<p> 
			
			It is part of the U.S. Department of Energy's program to  turn plutonium from "excess" nuclear warheads into mixed-oxide  (MOX) plutonium-uranium enriched fuel.  Greenpeace says the shipment is of 308 pounds of plutonium. A  spokesman for the U.S. Security Administration said the amount  being transported is 125 kg.<p> 
			
			The delivery is part of a post-Cold War agreement between  the United States and Russia to get rid of plutonium from  excess nuclear warheads.<p> 
			
			French state-owned nuclear energy firm Areva, whose Cogema  unit will recycle the plutonium into nuclear fuel, says the  shipment is safe.<p> 
			
			"The plutonium ... is shipped in casks that comply with the  regulation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Its transport is the object of the strongest safety and  security measures," Areva said in a statement.<p> 
			
			But activists, who expect the cargo to reach Cadarache  during the night or Friday, say the transport is irresponsible  and they have called for a rally close to the southeastern  factory later Thursday.<p> 
			
			"Independent expert analysis presented by Greenpeace to the  French government earlier this year exposed the potential scale  and severity of an accident or terrorist attack on plutonium  transports," Greenpeace's Burnie said.<p> 
			
			Wednesday, protesters watched as the boat docked but did  not interfere when the plutonium was loaded into a truck to be  transported to the La Hague peninsula. A French court ruling  has barred protesters from going within 100 meters of the  shipment.<p> 
			
			Activists Tuesday bolted a heavy truck to the road leading  to La Hague and chained themselves to the vehicle to try to  stop the delivery. Police used chain cutters to cut free the  protesters and later removed the truck.<p> 
			
			Under Tuesday's court ruling, any protester who goes within  100 meters of the shipment faces a 75,000 euro ($92,230) fine.
