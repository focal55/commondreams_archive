<p>WASHINGTON  - Ten-thousand Americans die each year  from asbestos-related diseases and the number appears to be  increasing in a growing public health crisis, according to a  report by an environmental research group released on Thursday.
<P>
The analysis by the Washington-based <a href="http://www.ewg.org/" target="_new">Environmental Working  Group</a> also projects that more than 100,000 people in the United  States will die of four asbestos-related diseases --  mesothelioma, asbestosis, lung cancer and gastrointestinal  cancer -- over the next ten years.
<P>
The nonprofit research organization said it based its  analysis on 25 years worth of U.S. government data on asbestos  mortality and examined the toll from just two causes of  asbestos deaths -- mesothelioma and asbestosis.
<P>
The report said that while most of the deaths were among  workers who were exposed to the fire-proofing mineral decades  ago, more than 1 million people are currently exposed to  asbestos on the job and millions more are exposed to asbestos  in the environment.
<P>
Asbestos was widely used for fireproofing and insulation  until the 1970s. Scientists have concluded that inhaled  asbestos fibers are linked to cancer and other diseases.
<P>
"We're at the beginning of a tidal wave of asbestos  diseases and mortality that needs to be brought to the  attention of the public, federal policymakers and health  officials," the report's author, Richard Wiles, said in an  interview.
<P>
Among recommendations to address what it says is a public  health problem of epidemic proportions, the EWG report calls  for an immediate ban on asbestos.
<P>
Dr. Richard Lemen, an occupational and environmental health  consultant and former assistant U.S. Surgeon General, said that  beyond a ban, public health agencies need to work to dispel the  misconception that asbestos is no longer a threat.
<P>
"Asbestos is still with us. We have reduced exposure and  that's a step in the right direction," Lemen said in a  telephone interview. "What we haven't done is we haven't had an  educational campaign and public health campaign to educate  people that it still exists and that there needs to be  precautions taken and people are going to continue to get  sick."
<P>
The EWG report also recommends federal asbestos health  screening and a "fair measure of assistance" for victims of  asbestos exposure.
<P>
The EWG's Wiles criticized as "grossly insufficient"  legislation under consideration in the U.S. Senate that aims to  end asbestos lawsuits.
<P>
"This is not an issue of bankruptcy (for asbestos firms).  This is a public health issue and they need to address it on  those terms," Wiles said.
