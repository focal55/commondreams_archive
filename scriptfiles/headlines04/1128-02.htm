<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Among some conservative Christians, there is a belief that President Bush received a "moral mandate" to win the recent presidential election — and they are calling on him act on their agenda now.

<P>"I believe Our Lord elected our president and I believe he put him in office and it is my prayer that he will sustain him in office," said one woman at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.



<P>Another was asked if she believed that God intervened in the election. "Absolutely," she said.

<P>"Values" voters delivered for the president, and the president must now deliver for them — especially in the courts, said Gary Cass, head of a grassroots political organization affiliated with Coral Ridge, called the Center for Reclaiming America.

<P>"It's about the next 40 years and how the courts are going to affect the world in which my children and grandchildren are going to be raised in," he said.

<P>Cass wants a U.S. Supreme Court that will outlaw abortion and gay marriage. "Do you want to take your children to a National League baseball game for instance and have homosexuals showing affection to one another? I don't want my kids to see that," he said.

<P>Risking God's Wrath

<P>By one measure, conservative Christians comprised 12 percent of the electorate this year — the same as four years ago. But they see themselves as a crucial piece of the president's political base.

<P>They believe that if their agenda is not implemented quickly — if their concerns are not addressed in a timely fashion — God will be angry.

<P>One leading evangelist recently warned, "God's patience runs out."

<P>Dr. James Kennedy delivers sermons at Coral Ridge which are broadcast to three million homes. He said he knows of no timetable for God's wrath, but wants results fast.

<P>He dismissed the concerns of people who worried about the impact of Christian conservatives on the U.S. government.

<P>Repent," he said with a laugh. "Repent. That's what I'd say."
<P>People who are concerned about the influence of Christianity "have never really surrendered their life to God and submitted themselves to his commandments — and if they did that they wouldn't have so much concern about some court saying again that it's wrong," he said.

<P>Asked about the millions of Americans who are not Christian, or have a different interpretation of Christianity, Kennedy said with another laugh: "I couldn't care less. It's true."



<P>"I think that the idea that the worst sin that somebody can commit is to offend somebody is ridiculous," he said.

<P>Evangelicals say Kennedy may seem intolerant, but there's no greater love than upholding the will of God.
