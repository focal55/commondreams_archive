<p>WASHINGTON  - Secretary of State Colin Powell has resigned and the White House is expected to make the announcement on Monday, U.S. officials said.

<p>"The Secretary announced to his staff this morning that he had submitted his resignation on Friday. He said he was staying on until a successor is confirmed and on board," a State Department official, who asked not to be named, said.

<p>An administration official also said Powell had said he would stay on "until such a time as a replacement is named."

<p>Powell, becomes the latest high-level member of President Bush's cabinet to announce plans to leave following the election.

<p>Powell was often seen representing more moderate views on foreign policy in the Bush administration.
