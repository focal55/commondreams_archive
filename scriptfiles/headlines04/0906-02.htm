CANONSBURG, Pa.  - Democratic presidential nominee  John Kerry on Monday called the invasion of Iraq "the wrong war  in the wrong place at the wrong time" and said his goal was to  withdraw U.S. troops in a first White House term.
<p> 
			
			Under pressure from some Democrats to change the subject  from national security -- regarded by many as President Bush's  strength -- Kerry tried to focus on the economy and other  domestic issues at a neighborhood meeting in Canonsburg, but  members of the audience raised Iraq.<p> 
			
			In Racine, West Virginia, Kerry assailed Bush's record,  repeatedly telling a Labor Day rally the "W" in Bush's name  stood for "wrong -- wrong choices, wrong judgment, wrong  priorities, wrong direction for our country" on everything from  jobs to Iraq.<p> 
			
			Kerry was trying to reinvigorate his campaign with a Labor  Day offensive in three battleground states -- Pennsylvania,  West Virginia and Ohio -- after weekend polls showed him  trailing Bush by double digits.<p> 
			
			The Massachusetts senator, who has said he would have voted  to give Bush the authority to use force if necessary against  Saddam Hussein even if he had known at the time that the Iraqi  leader had no weapons of mass destruction, has struggled to  draw clear contrasts with the president.<p> 
			
			"I would not have done just one thing differently than the  president on Iraq, I would have done everything differently  than the president on Iraq," Kerry said.<p> 
			
			He denied that he was "Monday morning quarterbacking." The  Bush campaign said Kerry had "demonstrated nothing but  indecision and vacillation" on Iraq."<p> 
			
			"I said this from the beginning of the debate to the walk  up to the war," Kerry told supporters. "I said, Mr. President  don't rush to war, take the time to build a legitimate  coalition and have a plan to win the peace."<p> 
			
			He said Bush had failed on all three counts. He called the  president's talk about a coalition fighting alongside about  125,000 U.S. troops "the phoniest thing I've ever heard."<p> 
			
			"You've about 500 troops here, 500 troops there and it's  American troops that are 90 percent of the combat casualties  and it's American taxpayers that are paying 90 percent of the  cost of the war," he said. "It's the wrong war, in the wrong  place at the wrong time."<p> 
			
			GETTING OUT OF IRAQ<p> 
			
			Bush, headed for a Labor Day swing into the battleground  state of Missouri, accused his rival of changing his position  on Iraq after bringing in new advisers to boost his campaign.<p> 
			
			"After voting for the war but against funding it, after  saying he would have voted for the war even knowing everything  we know today, my opponent woke up this morning with new  campaign advisers and yet another new position. Suddenly he's  against it again," Bush said in remarks prepared for delivery  at a campaign rally in Poplar Bluff, Missouri.<p> 
			
			With many Democrats outside Kerry's team urging him to take  steps to revitalize his White House bid, Kerry moved John  Sasso, a longtime adviser, from the Democratic National  Committee to a top job inside his campaign.<p> 
			
			Sasso will travel with the candidate through the Nov. 2  election. Several ex-aides to President Bill Clinton also were  added recently, including former White House press secretary  Joe Lockhart and Joel Johnson, a former senior White House  aide.<p> 
			
			A Kerry campaign spokesman said it was simply an expansion  of staff for the final two-month race.<p> 
			
			Kerry, like Bush, promised that the United States would  stay the course until Iraq was secure, saying: "We have to do  what we need to do to get out and do it right."<p> 
			
			He pledged to internationalize the forces in Iraq and do a  better job of fighting the war on terror.<p> 
			
			He also said Washington should make it clear to the world  that the United States had no "long-term designs to maintain  bases and troops in Iraq."<p> 
			
			"We want those troops home and my goal would be to try to  get them home in my first term and I believe that can be done,"  he said.<p> 
			
			If Kerry were to beat Bush in the Nov. 2 presidential  election, his first four-year term would end in January 2009.
