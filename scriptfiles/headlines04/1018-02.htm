      <p>WASHINGTON - The former top U.S. commander in Iraq complained last winter 
        to the Pentagon that a poor supply situation was threatening the Army's 
        ability to fight, The Washington Post reported on its Web site on Sunday. 
      <p>
 Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez wrote in a letter to top Army
officials that the lack of key spare parts for tanks,
helicopters and other systems was such a severe problem that "I
cannot continue to support sustained combat operations with
rates this low," the newspaper reported.
 <p>
 Senior Army officials told the newspaper that most of
Sanchez's concerns had been addressed but that they continue to
closely monitor the problems he identified.
 <p>
 Gary Motsek, deputy director of operations for the Army
Materiel Command, was quoted as saying that the situation is
"substantially better" now.
 <p>
 According to the newspaper, Sanchez said in a letter sent
Dec. 4 that Army units in Iraq were waiting an average of 40
days for critical spare parts, which he noted was almost three
times the Army's average.
 <p>
 He also protested that U.S. soldiers still needed
protective inserts to upgrade body armor and that delivery
twice had been postponed in the month before his writing, the
newspaper reported.
 <p>

 The Washington Post said it was given a copy of the letter
by a person familiar with the situation who was dismayed that
front-line troops had not been adequately supplied.
 <p>
 It said the person disagreed with the Bush administration's
handling of Iraq but quoted the source as saying this had not
played a part in the decision to go public.
      <p> The leaking of Sanchez's letter less than three weeks ahead of the U.S. 
        election could provide fuel for the campaign of Democratic presidential 
        contender John Kerry , who has accused President Bush of sending troops 
        into Iraq without adequate equipment. 
      <p>
 Bush has responded to the accusation by saying he had
provided his generals with everything they had asked for.
 <p>
 Sanchez was the senior U.S. military commander in Iraq from
June 2003 until the summer of 2004.
 <p>
 Last week 18 U.S. soldiers refused to go on a convoy
mission in Iraq and preliminary investigations showed they had
raised concerns about safety and the condition of their
vehicles.
