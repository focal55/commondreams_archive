<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Lawmakers used to wrangling over troop levels and weapons systems find themselves in a dispute over whether military personnel abroad should be given more of a liberal antidote to conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh.<p><P><!--/beginimage/-->

Liberals are upset that the Pentagon's American Forces Radio and Television Service is airing the first hour of Limbaugh's show, five days a week, on one of the 13 radio channels it offers.</p>
<p>"Liberals, moderates and independents contribute to funding for American Forces Radio through payment of their taxes, just like conservatives do," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who slipped a provision this month into a $447 billion defense bill to counter Limbaugh's presence on the Pentagon's airwaves.</p>
<p>Harkin's sense-of-the Senate resolution asks the secretary of defense to ensure that the former Armed Forces Radio presents in its programing "all sides of important public questions."</p>
<p>He complained that American Forces Radio offers no commentary "that would even begin to balance the extreme right-wing views that Rush Limbaugh routinely expresses on his program."</p>
<p>Conservatives are determined to get Harkin's measure removed from the bill when lawmakers return in July and start working on merging House and Senate versions of the legislation into one package.</p>
<p>"This amendment is absurd, and we respectfully ask you to oversee its removal," Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, said in a letter, released Monday, to California Rep. Duncan Hunter, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p>Johnson said American Services Radio has plenty of programing to counter Limbaugh, including the talk show of Jim Hightower, a liberal populist and former Texas agriculture commissioner. Hightower's 90-second spots are aired on two Armed Forces Radio channels, six times a day on one, twice a day on the other.</p>
<p>Larry Sichter, an American Forces spokesman, said the service's radio balance "is in the totality of the programing."</p>
<p>He said American Forces Radio tries to give military personnel a taste of what they would be hearing on the radio if they were back home by picking programs popular in the United States.</p>
