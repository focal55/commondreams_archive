<p>HOUSTON  - Former Enron Corp. Chairman
and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay surrendered to federal
authorities on Thursday to face criminal charges related to his
leadership of the disgraced energy powerhouse.

<p>
 Lay, who has steadfastly denied all wrongdoing, appeared
calm and relaxed as he entered FBI  offices in Houston. In a
statement on Wednesday after he was indicted, Lay said he had
done nothing wrong and that the indictment was not justified.

"You guys are up early," the 62-year-old Lay said as he
strode past a pack of about 50 reporters and news cameras
gathered in front of the FBI offices on Thursday. "Nice of you
all to show up this morning."
 <p>
 Asked if he planned to comment on the charges, he replied,
"I don't think this morning we'll make a statement."
 <p>
 His attorney, Mike Ramsey, said Lay would speak to
reporters later in the day.
<p>
 After about 20 minutes inside the FBI offices, where he was
fingerprinted and processed, Lay emerged in handcuffs and was
taken to a federal court house. He was scheduled to appear
before a federal magistrate judge at 11:30 a.m. local time.
<p>
 Houston-based Enron was the nation's seventh-largest
publicly owned company by revenue before it spiraled into a
then-record bankruptcy in the final months of 2001.
<p>
 Disclosures that the company hid billions of dollars in
debt and burnished its financial statements through the use of
complicated, off-the-books transactions ultimately prompted its
swift failure.
<p>
 Lay, a leading U.S. industrialist and close friend of
President Bush  -- who called him "Kenny Boy" -- now faces
felony charges stemming from the debacle.
<p>
 As has been the pattern with most of the 21 other ex-Enron
employees charged with crimes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission  is also expected to file civil charges against Lay.
 <p>
 Lay, as head of Houston Natural Gas, had executed a 1985
merger that formed the national pipelines giant that became
Enron. He was Enron's chief executive for most of the company's
history, ceding those duties to his hand-picked successor, Jeff
Skilling, in February 2001 until Skilling abruptly quit in
August 2001. Lay stepped back in as CEO until he was forced out
in disgrace in January 2002.
 <p>
 As Enron steamed toward collapse, Lay's appeals for help to
top Bush administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
Donald Evans, were met with silence.
 <p>
 The charges come two-and-a-half years after the Justice
Department's Enron Task Force began an investigation that has
slowly climbed the corporate ladder.
<p>
 Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who
simultaneously managed the off-books partnerships that struck
questionable deals with Enron, pleaded guilty in January in
exchange for a 10-year prison term and agreed to cooperate with
prosecutors.
<p>
 Fastow helped prosecutors bring charges against Skilling,
who, under Lay, was the architect of Enron's expansion into the
trading of everything from natural gas and electricity to
Internet network capacity.
<p>
 Skilling and Enron's former chief accountant, Rick Causey,
were charged together and have both pleaded not guilty to more
than three dozen counts of insider trading, fraud and lying on
Enron financial statements. Observers speculate Lay may face
similar charges.
