<p>BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader was rejected Friday in his bid to try to attend next week's Democratic National Convention.</b></p>
<p>&quot;Given that Nader is running on the Pat Buchanan Reform Party ticket and is openly accepting both financial and organizational help from Republicans and their allies, the answer is no,&quot; Democratic National Committee spokesman Jano Cabrera said.</p>
<p>Buchanan, a conservative commentator, was the Reform Party's presidential candidate in 2000. The party has endorsed Nader this year.</p>
<p>Nader, who was informed of the Democrats' decision by CNN, said, &quot;Is that what happened? Well, that's unfortunate.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he wanted to attend the convention &quot;to see the Democrats and how they toe the line to all those corporate hospitality suites, wine and dine them for political favors. You can read about it, but you don't really see it. You can't feel it until you're there. It's pretty disgusting.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if the consumer advocate would endorse presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry, Nader said, &quot;Of course not. I'm running for president.&quot;</p>
<p>This is Nader's fourth bid for the presidency.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe said Nader should consider backing Kerry because otherwise his legacy could be that he gave &quot;this country eight years of George Bush.&quot;</p>
<p>Democrats have often blamed Nader's Green Party candidacy for costing Al Gore the presidency in 2000, and many have said they fear a repeat this year if Nader stays in the race.</p>
<p>Nader disagrees. The Supreme Court, he has said, cost Gore the election, and he blames the former vice president for running a lackluster campaign.</p>
<p>Nader, 70, contends that both major parties are captive to corporate interests.</p>
<p>He has said he's running for the health, safety and economic well-being of the American people.</p><p align="center">&copy;  2004 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.</p>
