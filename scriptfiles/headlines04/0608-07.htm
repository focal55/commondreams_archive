<p>During his 15 years with The Boeing Co., Stephen Gentry never pictured himself wearing the union label.
<p>Then the computer programmer from Auburn, Wash., was laid off last summer after training his replacement, a high-tech worker in India.
<p>Now Gentry, who hasn&#039;t worked since, is among those convinced that America&#039;s white-collar workers have to band together to keep their futures from being exported to places where skilled labor comes cheap.
<p>&#034;I don&#039;t see any other options,&#034; said Gentry, 52, who&#039;s joined a Seattle-based union trying to organize tech workers around the country. &#034;There&#039;s no loyalty anymore. I feel my job was taken by corporate greed.&#034;

For some unions, the growing concerns about offshoring are an opportunity to recruit more workers like Gentry.
<p>&#034;I get a call last week from Intel, I get a call from Microsoft, I get calls from places we never used to get calls from,&#034; said Andy Banks, organizing director for the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers in Silver Spring, Md. &#034;People are realizing that labor unions are the best-kept secret in America. You have no employment rights at work unless you have a collective bargaining agreement.&#034;
<p>The issue&#039;s potency, particularly during a jobless economic recovery, was proven last month when the Communications Workers of America negotiated a new contract with SBC Communications Inc. after a four-day strike. As part of the deal, the San Antonio-based phone company agreed to work with the union to bring an estimated 3,000 company jobs in India and the Philippines to the United States.
<p>During the strike by CWA&#039;s 102,000 SBC workers, thousands of picketers around the country hoisted anti-offshoring signs saying &#034;SBC Unpatriotic&#034; and &#034;Keep Jobs in America.&#034;
<p>&#034;There is something to be said for shaming a company if you say &#039;This company will outsource good jobs from our community,&#039; &#034; said Christian Weller, a researcher at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank. &#034;In the current environment, it&#039;s a land mine for the company. There&#039;s a real receptive audience for this.&#034;
<p>That connection was important for CWA, given that for decades labor unions have been losing bargaining clout and public prestige.
<p>Fewer than 10 percent of the nation&#039;s private-sector workers now are unionized, down from a peak of 37 percent in 1960, according to federal statistics.
<p>&#034;This is a kind of lever to convince the public that labor is under pressure more than people realize it is, that it could be you tomorrow,&#034; said Alex Colvin, a labor professor at Penn State University.
<p>But another labor organizer said the foreign outsourcing issue can cut both ways.
<p>&#034;They&#039;re afraid that their job is not secure and therefore they want a union to protect them,&#034; Kevin Kistler of New York-based Office and Professional Employees International, said of workers. &#034;But they&#039;re also afraid to stick their head up and try to help form the union because their job is so tenuous.&#034;
<p>The number of U.S. high-tech and service jobs that have been moved overseas so far is relatively small, but a report last month said the pace is quickening.
<p>Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research estimates about 830,000 such positions will be relocated to India, Russia and other low-wage nations by the end of 2005, and that 3.4 million jobs representing &#036;136 billion in U.S. wages will be lost by 2015.
<p>Labor organizer Banks said the CWA&#039;s success with SBC is an important lesson for other unions.
<p>&#034;If we have enough examples where people are winning the outsourcing issue, why wouldn&#039;t people turn to unions?&#034; he said. &#034;It can be the one issue that can revitalize the labor movement.&#034;
<p>Banks said offshoring work was a key issue that helped his union recently organize 250 engineers and architects employed by the city of San Jose, Calif. He said a drive to organize engineers will start soon in Seattle.
<p>Marcus Courtney, who in 1997 co-founded the Washington Alliance of Technical Workers in Seattle, says the unionizing effort started slowly, but has gained momentum. WashTech&#039;s dues-paying membership has more than doubled to 450 in the past year, he says, while its newsletter subscriber list grew eightfold to 17,000.
<p>&#034;And we are talking to almost a thousand workers a month about organizing,&#034; said Courtney, whose union has offshoots in most of the nation&#039;s high-tech centers. &#034;Not only is (offshoring) resonating with the public, but they&#039;re seeing unions are addressing it and they&#039;re out front on it.&#034;
<p>Uday Karmarkar, a UCLA management professor, said corporate efforts to cut costs by automating more tasks and encouraging self-service via the Internet threaten at least as many white-collar jobs as offshoring.
<p>&#034;There&#039;s a much better us-versus-them story when it&#039;s offshoring,&#034; said Karmarkar, who wrote an article on the subject for the current edition of the Harvard Business Review. &#034;It&#039;s &#039;Somebody&#039;s taking our jobs,&#039; rather than &#039;We&#039;re automating the jobs.&#039; &#034;
<p>Gentry, the laid-off programmer, said he overcame a deep aversion to unions to become an active part of Courtney&#039;s group.
<p>&#034;I thought these guys are trying to do what&#039;s right,&#034; he said. &#034;I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll do much good, but I feel like I&#039;m doing something.&#034;
