<p>The alleged mastermind behind the 1980 killing of Archbishop Oscar Romero in El Salvador was due to be tried in his absence in California yesterday on charges of extrajudicial killing and crimes against humanity. 
<p>An anonymous relative of the archbishop has brought the charges in the hope of winning substantial damages against the man, a former Salvadorean air force captain.

Alvaro Rafael Saviria, who until last year was a used-car salesman in Modesto, California, is charged with planning and facilitating the murder of the archbishop as he celebrated mass in San Salvador on March 24 1980.  
<p>But Mr Saviria, who has lived in the US since at least 1987, is unlikely to be in court. He disappeared after a com plaint was filed against him in September last year.  
<p>Archbishop Romero was a charismatic and influential figure in the turbulent politics of El Salvador at the end of the 1970s. As an outspoken defender of the rights of the poor and a critic of the rightwing death squads, he was the target of death threats.  
<p>The UN has estimated that between the late 1970s and 1992, rightwing death squads killed 75,000 civilians in El Salvador. The day before his assassination, Archbishop Romero addressed his sermon to the soldiers involved in the killings.  
<p>The next day, the lawsuit alleges, Mr Saviria met with the reputed leader of the death squads, Roberto D'Aubuisson. Mr Saviria ordered his driver to take an unknown assassin to the church. The shot that killed the archbishop was allegedly fired from the car, parked 80 to 100 feet away.  
<p>Mr Saviria then allegedly reported the successful murder to D'Aubuisson and paid the gunman in cash. D'Aubuisson died in 1992.  
<p>"This is the first court hearing that's going to examine the personal responsibility of those who planned the assassination," said Sandra Coliver, director of the Centre for Justice and Accountablity, which brought the case.  
<p>Mr Saviria, who is in his 60s, is thought to have initially entered the US on a visitor's visa and stayed in the country when the visa expired. In 1987, he was detained in Miami when Salvadorean prosecutors sought his extradition in connection with the murder of the archbishop. But the extradition request was withdrawn and he was released.  
<p>In the early 1990s he is   thought to have moved from Florida to California, settling in Modesto. He set up a business, the Modesto Auto Mart, but left more than a year ago, leaving a trail of debts and lawsuits.  
<p>Under a 1993 Salvadorean amnesty he cannot be tried for his part in the killing in his home country.  
<p>This week's trial will hear testimony from many who were close to the archbishop and to the political situation in El Salvador at the time of his murder, including a former US ambassador, Robert White.  
<p>Ms Coliver said prosecutors hoped information would emerge in the trial that would lead them closer to the killer. "We are using this hearing as a step," she said."We believe there are other people who live here or regularly travel through the US with equal degrees of responsibility." </p>
