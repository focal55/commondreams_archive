<p>CHERBOURG, France  - Protesters bolted a  heavy truck to the road leading to a French nuclear reprocessing  plant on Tuesday and chained themselves to the vehicle to try to  stop a controversial delivery of U.S. weapons-grade plutonium.

Two ships, the Pacific Teal and the Pacific Pintail, transporting 140 kg of weapons-grade plutonium, arrive from the United States in Cherbourg, October 5, 2004. The nuclear waste will be conditioned here before being transported from this Northwestern French port some 1,200 kms by road to a plutonium fuel fabrication facility in Cadarache, Southern France.

Police used chain cutters to cut free the protesters, who  wore bright orange overalls, and dragged them away. The yellow  truck, which had &quot;Stop Plutonium&quot; written across it, remained.
<p></p>
Environmental group Greenpeace said police detained four of  its protesters. The group wants to stop the delivery of 140 kg  (308 lb) of plutonium which it expects to arrive by ship in the  French port of Cherbourg on Tuesday night.
<p></p>
The plutonium will then be taken about 18 km (12 miles) to  the reprocessing plant the La Hague peninsula, before being  driven nearly 1,000 km (660 miles) to a factory in southeastern  France for recycling.
<p></p>
Greenpeace says the transport is vulnerable to a terrorist  attack. French state-owned nuclear energy firm Areva, which is  being paid to reprocess the plutonium, says it is safe.
<p></p>
&quot;So easily a rocket-propelled grenade could go through those  trucks and expose plutonium around this area. That's not safe  transport,&quot; Greenpeace activist Thomas Breuer told reporters.
<p></p>
&quot;This plutonium shipment is part of an industry plan to  expand the trade in bomb material and must be stopped,&quot; said Tom  Clements of Greenpeace International.
<p></p>
Laurence Pernot, a spokesman for Areva's Cogema unit which  will recycle the plutonium, said the aim was to make the  plutonium safe by reprocessing it.
<p></p>
&quot;We do not quite understand how an organisation that  traditionally fights against the proliferation of nuclear  weapons can today wage a protest against an operation aimed at  curtailing that same proliferation phenomenon,&quot; she said.&quot;
<p></p>
Russian-made missiles were among an arms cache seized by  French police in the southwestern French Basque area on Sunday.
<p></p>
The plutonium shipment is part of a post-Cold War agreement  between the United States and Russia to get rid of plutonium  from excess nuclear warheads.
<p></p>
Cogema will recycle the plutonium into nuclear fuel at its  Cadarache and Marcoule plants in southeastern France and ship it  back to the United States which plans to use it in an  electricity-generating reactor.
<p></p>
This is part of the U.S. Department of Energy's  controversial programme to turn plutonium from the &quot;excess&quot;  nuclear warheads into mixed-oxide (MOX) plutonium-uranium  enriched fuel.
