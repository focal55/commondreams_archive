<p>WASHINGTON - U.S. businesses added 96,000 jobs to
payrolls in September, the government reported on Friday, a
weaker-than-expected total that was expected to sharpen a
presidential debate later in the day over the economy's
direction.

The Labor Department  report, showing the unemployment rate
in September held steady at 5.4 percent, will provide fodder
for the second debate between President Bush  and Democratic
Presidential contender Sen. John Kerry. It was the final jobs
report before the Nov. 2 presidential election with polls
indicating that jobs are of paramount concern to voters.
<p>The September job-creation total came in below Wall Street
economists' forecasts for 148,000 new jobs. The department also
revised down its estimate of August new jobs to 128,000 from
144,000 it reported a month ago.
<p>Most jobs in September came in the services sector, while
manufacturers shed 18,000 jobs last month after increased
hiring in the two prior months.
<p>Though four hurricanes swept through the Southeast during
August and September, which Labor said likely held down
employment growth, it concluded the impact was minimal.

<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Kathleen
Utgoff, said "we do not believe the net result of...(the
hurricanes) materially changes the national employment
situation, but we cannot precisely quantify the weather
effects."
<p>Analysts described the jobs number as weak.
<p>"It is a disappointing number, it suggests the economy is
still not growing particularly quickly," said economist David
Sloan of 4Cast Ltd. in New York. The U.S. Federal Reserve  has
raised short-term interest rates three times this year -- from
46-year lows in June -- to 1.75 percent and analysts said the
jobs report left room to keep raising them but not by much.
<p>"For the Fed, I think our view has been for a while that
the next move will be the last one and that the fed funds rate
stays at 2 percent until the end of 2005," predicted Jason Daw,
a foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
<p>The dollar dropped sharply against the euro after the
number was issued, apparently in the belief it raised questions
about the durability of U.S. economic growth, while bond prices
increased.
<p>Labor also said that, according to preliminary estimates,
the economy added about 236,000 more jobs than previously
thought in the year ended March 2004, and it will incorporate
the change into benchmark revisions issued in February.

<p>After including the projected change, it appears that about
585,000 jobs have been lost since President Bush took office in
January 2001.
