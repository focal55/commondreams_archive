"I don't know if we'll survive the next four years ... I don't
think the Americans have, on the whole, the faintest idea - and I
have to say also I don't think most Australians do either. But it's
not just the threat from nuclear war. It's the threat of what's
happening to the environment, the global warming which is occurring
rapidly now, to ozone depletion, to species extinction, to
deforestation - it's the whole thing."</p>
<p>Speaking from her son Will's Boston home, the Australian
pediatrician, who runs the Nuclear Policy Research Institute in
Washington, has just spent a frantic two-and-a-half months
criss-crossing America to deliver her anti-nuclear and anti-Bush
message. She discovered the country was more divided than at any
time since she first stepped onto American soil in 1966.</p>
<div id="adSpotIsland" class="islandad"></div><p>Early on election day she was convinced Democratic challenger
John Kerry would win but reality soon set in.</p>
<p>"This is what I've been afraid of and I actually can't believe
it's happening," she said. "The voter turnout was so high, which
should have supported Kerry.</p>
<p>"I don't think I've ever felt so personally, politically
devastated in my life and that includes when [former president
Ronald] Reagan won a second term of office - which was pretty
devastating for me as I was so heavily involved in the anti-nuclear
movement in those days.</p>
<p>"But this is worse, these people are much worse than the Reagan
people."</p>
<p>Dr Caldicott rose to fame in the American peace movement during
the '70s and '80s, her vehement antinuclear stance earning her many
enemies, some of whom saw her as an apologist for the Soviet Union.
She has long warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons, America's
"first strike" policy and missile defense.</p>
<p>In her 2002 book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565847407/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The New Nuclear Danger</a></i>, she detailed
links between the Government and weapons makers and Mr Bush's will
to militarize space.</p>

<p>Mr Bush's win meant "endless war and I think it could mean
nuclear war", she said.</p>
<p>"In January 1995 we got to within 10 seconds of nuclear war when
[former Russian president Boris] Yeltsin and the Russians made a
mistake and thought they were under attack. The Americans still
have a first-strike policy to win a nuclear war against Russia. The
weapons are still in place both in America and Russia. Virtually
nobody knows that in this country and that a mistake or a terrorist
takeover of the command system - on either side - or errors being
made could lead to the end of life on earth."</p>
<p>In a website interview two years ago, Dr Caldicott was asked why
Mr Bush remained so popular. She replied she didn't believe it -
that the polls were inaccurate [although that was before the
invasion of Iraq].</p>
<p>Now she has to face the reality that more than half of Americans
want Mr Bush back, despite [or because of] his policies. She puts
it down to brilliance on the part of his campaign team, in
particular Karl Rove, and the ignorance of much of the
population.</p>
<p>"They [the Bush administration] have been able to con the
American people with their extremely brilliant propaganda and
brainwashing, with the help of the media ... they consistently lie.
On the whole the American people don't really understand the
dynamics of the right at all. They don't know that Bush et al want
to go into Iran next and that they want to dominate the world
militarily and that they want to put weapons in space.</p>
<p>"I don't think they [the American public] understand. It is a
mandate for Bush to do absolutely anything he wants. I know people
don't like me using this word but they're fascists."</p>
<p>Not firing all her ammunition at Mr Bush, she saved some for
Australian Prime Minister John Howard. She said Australia was now
the "51st state of the US".</p>
<p>"I've always been so proud of my country, now I'm not just
ashamed by what's happening and embarrassed ... but I really fear
for the future of Australia and the previous wonderful quality of
life that we've always had."</p>
