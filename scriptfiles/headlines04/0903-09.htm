<p>WEST ALLIS, Wis. -- President Bush on Friday wished Bill Clinton "best wishes for a swift and speedy recovery." 

<p>"He's is in our thoughts and prayers," Bush said at a campaign rally. 

<p>Bush's audience of thousands in West Allis, Wis., booed. Bush did nothing to stop them. 

<p>Bush offered his wishes while campaigning one day after accepting the presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in New York. Clinton was hospitalized in New York after complaining of mild chest pain and shortness of breath. 

<p>Bush recently praised Clinton when the former president went to the White House for the unveiling of his official portrait. He lauded Clinton for his knowledge, compassion and "the forward-looking spirit that Americans like in a president."
