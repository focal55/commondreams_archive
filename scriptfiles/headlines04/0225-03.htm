<p>A day after Education Secretary  Rod Paige compared the nation's largest teachers union to a "terrorist organization" because of its criticism of <alt-code idsrc="nyt-per-pol" value="Bush, George W"/>President Bush's centerpiece education law, the union brushed aside his apologies and called for his dismissal. </p>

<!--/endimage/-->"Our members are the N.E.A.,  and on behalf of them, I ask President Bush to express his regret to the nation's educators and demand that Secretary Paige step down," said the union's president, Reg Weaver.</p>
<P>
And in the House, Representative Betty McCollum, Democrat of Minnesota,  called on Dr. Paige to resign. She characterized  his remarks as "neo-McCarthyism at its worst."</p>
<P>
The  reactions  made public  an  often bitter  struggle between the Bush administration and the  National Education Association, which has 2.7 million members and  frequently supports the Democrats at election time. The administration and the union have been at odds practically since January 2002, when the president signed the law, known as No Child Left Behind. It expands the use of tests to raise student achievement. </p>
<P>
The union sees the law as a barely concealed effort to weaken public education and build support for vouchers. </p>
<P>
In July, Mr. Weaver told delegates at the N.E.A.'s annual meeting that the union intended to sue the Education Department for failing to  finance  the law fully. Dr. Paige responded   that supporters of the law were assembled in a "coalition of the winning" but that "the N.E.A. wants to assemble a coalition of the whining."</p>
<P>
That was one of many rhetorical attacks that Dr. Paige has directed   not only at the  union but also at the law's critics,  like  school superintendents  and state legislators. In recent months he has called such critics  "nihilists" and compared them to  French diplomats at the United Nations who opposed resolutions on Iraq as well as to  racists who opposed  desegregation.</p>
<P>
In a White House meeting with governors on Monday, Dr. Paige "said he considered the N.E.A. to be a terrorist organization," his spokeswoman, Susan Aspey, said. He quickly apologized, but those remarks as well as mounting irritation with the law  among many educators appeared to have created alliances between  groups that are often at odds. </p>
<P>
The American Federation of Teachers, a union that has 1.3 million members and is a rival, closed ranks with the N.E.A. yesterday.</p>
<P>
"Secretary Paige's statement is indicative of the way this administration and this secretary paint with a broad brush and attack anybody that disagrees with them," said Alex Wohl,  a federation spokesman. "There has to be room for disagreement, but this administration tends to simply attack the messenger instead of discussing the message."</p>
<P>
Dr. Paige met yesterday with Democratic lawmakers, who spent 15 minutes criticizing his  remarks. The secretary apologized profusely, people at the meeting said.</p>
<P>
"If I had a rewind button, I'd use it," one participant quoted Dr. Paige as telling them.</p>
<P>
Dr. Paige said his comment was "insensitive, thoughtless and unfortunate,"  another participant said.</p>
<P>
In a statement issued through a spokesman today, Dr. Paige noted that black and Hispanic students were  doing  poorly in many schools. "That is the status quo," he said. "That is why I am so passionate about making these historic reforms and drawing attention to the issue."</p>
<P>
On a day when criticism rained from many sides, Dr. Paige received support from the  union leader who perhaps knows him best: Gayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers. They worked together when Dr. Paige was the  superintendent of Houston schools in the 1990's. Ms. Fallon said his remarks had been  misinterpreted.</p>
<P>
"Rod has a real sarcastic sense of humor," she said. "I'd walk into the room, and he'd say, `Well here's my favorite labor terrorist.' But he was joking. He said far worse to me at other times. So I think he popped off with a sarcastic remark that has been blown out of proportion."</p>
<P>
As secretary, Dr. Paige has frequently directed what his critics call intemperate rhetoric at those who oppose even parts of the law, which requires that  state and local  testing systems be adjusted to meet federal regulations. In October 2002, Dr. Paige called state education officials who were setting  standards that he considered insufficiently demanding "enemies of equal justice and equal opportunity."</p>
<P>
In early January, in discussing  the  Brown v. Board of Education desegregation case, Dr. Paige compared  critics of the new education law  to "those who fought Brown,"  suggesting  the critics  were racists.</p>
<P>
And on Jan. 28, he compared those who oppose educational choice, the movement that includes everything from vouchers to charter schools, to "the French at the United Nations, promising to veto any resolution on Iraq, regardless of what it says."</p>
