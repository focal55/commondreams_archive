BAGHDAD - Members of Iraq's interim Governing Council reacted with dismay to a draft UN resolution submitted by the United States and Britain that sets no date for troops to leave Iraq and gives them wide powers to fight "terrorism. 

 <p>
 
Speaking on behalf of the council, the current president of the US-installed group, Ghazi al-Yawar, told reporters that "while it was very positive, in many regards it fell short of our expectations."
 <p>
 The draft Security Council resolution, which was presented Monday, pledges Iraqi sovereignty on June 30 but leaves unresolved key issues about the handover of power.
<p>
 Diplomats at the UN headquarters in New York admitted that many blanks remained to be filled, and even the United States acknowledged some pieces of the puzzle were still missing.
<p>
 Yawar, a Sunni Muslim, said the council's two main concerns were that the interim government must have the power to ask foreign troops to leave Iraq and that it excercise full control over funds to reconstruct the war-torn country.
<p>
 Council spokesman Hamid al-Kifaey said the interim leadership would oppose any text that restricts its sovereignty.
<p>
 "We don't wish the UN to impose anything on an Iraqi sovereign government which will restrict its sovereignty. That is something we do not like. Unless the troops are UN troops," he told AFP.
<p>
 In London, Iraqi interim defence minister Ali Allawi said he expected foreign troops to remain in the country for "months rather than years".
<p>
 "The multinational force, in as much as its presence is needed to maintain security, will need ... to be replaced by indigenous forces, by Iraqi forces".
<p>
 Many Iraqis object to the presence of foreign troops, but see them as vital to prevent the country's rampant insecurity from degenerating into chaos.
<p>
 Later, maverick Shiite council member Ahmed Chalabi, who cut his ties with the US-led coalition Thursday after a US-backed Iraqi police raid on his property, said any UN role in shaping a sovereign Iraq would be "dangerous".
<p>
 "The envoy of the UN secretary general is organising a national conference to choose a consultative council. This is a dangerous idea that provokes instability," Chalabi told reporters at a Baghdad news conference.
<p>
 He said replacing "the coalition's occupation in Iraq with a UN mandate will not give Iraqis a stake in their country."
<p>
 Speaking to AFP, Kurdish council member Mahmud Othman criticised Britain and the United States for failing to consult the Governing Council before submitting the draft resolution.
<p>
 "The Security Council is discussing what concerns Iraq and it's not fair. They should have invited Iraqis to be there at the discussions. We are upset about this," he said, branding the draft "disappointing".
<p>
 He said the status of foreign troops should be discussed between a sovereign Iraqi government and the Americans, adding that such forces "should not be immune to any accountability," alluding to the US prison abuse scandal.
<p>
 "I think Iraqis should have a say in the punishment and accountability," he said.
<p>
 The Governing Council would draw up a formal response to the resolution after finishing talks on the matter Wednesday, he added.
<p>
Coalition spokesman Dan Senor said Tuesday US forces would remain in Iraq indefinitely until a secure and peaceful democracy had been built.
<p>
"Coalition forces will be on the ground here until we achieve our goal which is to hand over to the people of Iraq a sovereign and democratic Iraq which is stable ... and at peace with the world," coalition spokesman Dan Senor said.
<p>
"We recognise that there is still a significant terror threat in Iraq and we also recognise that Iraqi security forces are not in a position to defend against that terror threat on their own right now, so it may take some time to achieve the totality of the goal."
