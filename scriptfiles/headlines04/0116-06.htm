<p>ATLANTA - In a sign of the difficulty President  Bush faces as he tries to win black support for his reelection,  several hundred protesters loudly booed him on Thursday as he  laid a wreath at the grave of civil rights leader Martin Luther  King.<p> 
			
							"Bush go home" and "peace not war" the predominantly black  crowd of protesters shouted from behind a barrier of buses, as  Bush paid tribute to King on the 75th anniversary of his birth.<p>

  <!--/endimage/-->Bush wants to improve his standing among black voters this  reelection year, after winning less than 10 percent of the  African-American vote in 2000.<p> 
			
							The president was accompanied by King's widow Coretta Scott  King, and sister, Christine King Farris. He placed the wreath,  bowed his head for a few moments, and departed without speaking  or facing the protesters as the boos from the crowd increased.<p> 
			
							The protesters carried signs with slogans like "Money for  jobs and housing, not war" and "It's not a photo-op George."<p> 
			
							A White House spokesman defended Bush's visit to the grave  of the assassinated civil rights icon.<p> 
			
							"This is about paying tribute to someone who had a  tremendously positive influence in shaping the world that we  live in today ... it's a solemn moment, a nice way to honor Dr.  King," spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.<p> 
			
							Bush was in Atlanta as part of a two-state swing during  which he also raised $2.3 million in campaign funds, trumpeted  a reelection endorsement from Georgia Democratic Sen. Zell  Miller, and promoted government aid for religious charities.<p> 
			
							King's birthday is commemorated by a national holiday on  Monday, recognizing his non-violent leadership of the black  civil rights struggle in the 1950s and 1960s.<p> 
			
							"Today, all Americans benefit from Dr. King's work and his  legacy of courage, dignity, and moral clarity," Bush said in a  written statement proclaiming the annual holiday.<p> 
			
							Bush faces a stiff challenge in wooing black voters.<p> 
			
							"Bush's policies contradict everything Dr. King stood for,"  said Ann Mauney, a member of the Georgia Peace and Justice  Coalition.<p> 
			
							U.S. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and  chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, criticized the  grave visit as "yet another symbolic gesture that lacks any  real substance."<p> 
			
							"Every policy decision of the Bush Administration including  the war in Iraq, healthcare, jobs, the economy, judicial  nominations, housing, the environment, as well as secondary and  higher education, has done nothing to strengthen Dr. King's  dream," Cummings said.<p> 
			
							Earlier on Thursday, Bush hailed King's legacy during a  visit to the predominantly black Union Bethel African Methodist  Episcopal church in New Orleans. "I'm really not worthy to  stand here, when I think about the fact that ... this is the  very place where Martin Luther King stood, as well, some 42  years ago."<p> 
			
							He also promoted his program of government aid for  religious charities, which is popular among some black clergy.  He announced new rules that help "faith-based" charities  compete for $3.7 billion in Justice Department funding.<p> 
			
							Bush raised $1 million at a New Orleans campaign  fundraiser, and $1.3 million in Atlanta.<p>
