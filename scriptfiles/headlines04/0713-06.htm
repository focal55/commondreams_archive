While two thirds of the 100-member Senate would be needed  to pass the measure, Republican backers scrambled to get even a  simple majority.<p> 
			
			They conceded they did not have the 60 votes needed to  survive a procedural vote scheduled for Wednesday, meaning the  measure will likely be dead for the year.<p> 
			
			Republicans, accused by Democrats of seeking the proposed  amendment to rally their socially conservative base, vowed to  try again.<p> 
			
			"This issue is not going away," said Senate Majority Leader  Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican.<p> 
			
			"I'm hoping we get some 45 (votes)," said Sen. Rick  Santorum of Pennsylvania, another member of the Republican  leadership. "If we get close to 50 that would be great."<p> 
			
			Steve Fisher of Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian  civil rights group, said, "If we hold them to under 50 votes it  would send an extraordinary message that playing politics with  discrimination will fail."<p> 
			
			Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, charged the  Republican leadership with bringing up the proposal for "pure  politics."<p> 
			
			"They're hoping to use the issue to drive a wedge between  one group of citizens and the rest of the country, solely for  partisan advantage," he said.<p> 
			
			Republicans say gay marriage devalues traditional marriage,  which they say is a pillar of civilization, and should be  outlawed for the sake of children.<p> 
			
			Polls show most Americans oppose same-sex marriage but are  split on whether a constitutional ban is needed. Surveys also  find voters believe other issues are more important -- such as  health care, education and national security.<p> 
			
			Republicans forced consideration of the proposed amendment  two weeks before John Kerry, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts,  will receive his party's presidential nomination at the  Democratic national convention in Boston.<p> 
			
			Massachusetts in May became the first U.S. state to allow  same-sex marriage.<p> 
			
			Kerry and his running mate, Sen. John Edwards of North  Carolina, oppose same sex-marriage but argue amending the  Constitution is not the answer. They say it should be left up  to the states to define marriage.<p> 
			
			Despite claims to the contrary by proponents, some critics  also argue that the measure could undermine existing state and  local domestic partnership laws, which provide couples some  financial and legal protections.<p> 
			
			KERRY OPPOSES AMENDMENT<p> 
			
			At a fund-raiser in Boston on Monday, Kerry alluded to the  gay marriage debate as a symbol of what he characterized as a  divisive Republican president.<p> 
			
			"Values aren't talking about peoples' rights and opening  the door of opportunity, and then you turn around and for  political purposes in the middle of a campaign, you bring an  amendment to the Constitution of the United States just to  divide America," Kerry said.<p> 
			
			For a proposed constitutional amendment to become law, it  must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate and House of  Representatives, then ratified by 38 of the 50 states.<p> 
			
			The House is to consider a proposed amendment to ban  same-sex marriage in September, but it is also expected to fall  far short of the needed votes.<p> 
			
			Bush in February called on the U.S. Congress to approve  such an amendment after Massachusetts' highest court ruled gay  couples had a right to wed and San Francisco began issuing  marriage licenses to same-sex couples.<p> 
			
			These actions helped spawn lawsuits across the nation,  including ones calling on other states to recognize same-sex  marriage.
