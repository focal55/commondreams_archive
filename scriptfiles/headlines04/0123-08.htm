<p>SAN FRANCISCO  - U.S. forestry officials announced
on Thursday that they would significantly expand the amount of
logging allowed in California's Sierra Nevada mountains in what
they described as an effort to curb wildfires.
<p>
 Environmental groups and a California state official
attacked the plan as showing disregard for the environment.
<p>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service said it
would permit logging of 700,000 acres over the next 20 years.
 <p>
 "I personally witnessed the human suffering and
catastrophic damage caused by those fires," Forest Service
Regional Forester Jack Blackwell said.
 <p>
 "I am personally convinced that future droughts in the
Sierra Nevada, coupled with periods of wind and high
temperatures, could lead to the same devastation there," he
said in a statement. "It is my professional responsibility to
take decisive action."
 <p>
 State Attorney General Bill Lockyer, a Democrat, condemned
the decision. "Once again, the Bush White House has
demonstrated its continued disregard for the environment and
willingness to sacrifice natural resources Californians
cherish," he said.
 <p>
 "Under the guise of addressing fire risk, the revised
framework will substantially increase commercial logging,
endanger wildlife habitats and weaken water quality protections
and grazing limitations."
 <p>
 The Sierra Nevada region spans 400 miles along the eastern
edge of California and is home to grizzly bear, mountain sheep
and sequoia, pine, and aspen trees.
 <p>
 In December, President Bush  signed into law a plan he said
would reduce the risk of wildfires in federal forests.
Environmental groups called it a giveaway to the timber
industry.
 <p>
 Californians were reminded of the dangers of forest fires
when blazes in the southern part of the state late last year
killed nearly two dozen people and destroyed 3,400 homes.
 <p>
 Forest service spokesman Dave Reider said the plans
increase the amount of wood that could be harvested four-fold
compared to a 2001 plan. He said loggers would be allowed to
cut 330 million board feet in the Sierra Nevada per year, up
from 70 to 80 million board feet in the earlier plan.
 <p>
 Builders use about 15,000 board feet to build a
three-bedroom home, he said.
 <p>
 "These changes are bad news for those of us who live here,"
said John Brissenden, who owns a resort lodge in Hope Valley.
"Cutting trees miles away from our homes won't protect us from
wildfire. People want to bring their kids to hike, camp and
fish in a peaceful place, not a logging project."
