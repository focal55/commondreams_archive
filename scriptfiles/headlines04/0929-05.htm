<p>NEW YORK - A key part of the Patriot Act, a  central plank of the Bush Administration's war on terror, was  ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge on Wednesday, in the  latest blow to U.S. security policies.<p> 
			
			U.S. District Judge Victor Marreo ruled in favor of the  American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the power the  FBI has to demand confidential financial records from companies  that it can obtain without court approval as part of terrorism  investigations.<p> 
			
			The legislation bars companies and other recipients of  these subpoenas from ever revealing that they received the FBI  demand for records. Marreo held that this permanent ban was a  violation of free speech rights.<p> 
			
			In his ruling, Marreo prohibited the Department of Justice  and the FBI from issuing special administrative subpoenas,  known as national security letters. But he delayed enforcement  of his judgment pending an expected appeal by the government.    The Department of Justice said it was reviewing the ruling.<p> 
			
			The ruling was the latest blow to the Bush administration's  anti-terrorism policies.<p> 
			
			In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that terror suspects  being held in U.S. facilities like Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, can  use the American judicial system to challenge their  confinement. That ruling was a defeat for the president's  assertion of sweeping powers to hold "enemy combatants"  indefinitely after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.<p> 
			
			The FBI first received power to get customer records in  1986 legislation, but its power to obtain confidential data was  greatly expanded by the Patriot Act -- a controversial law the  Bush administration pushed through Congress after the Sept. 11,  2001 attacks to help it battle terrorism.<p> 
			
			The ACLU argued that the anti-terrorism laws give the FBI  unconstitutional power to demand sensitive information without  adequate safeguards.<p> 
			
			The judge agreed, saying the provision "effectively bars or  substantially deters any judicial challenge."<p> 
			
			"Such a challenge is necessary to vindicate important  rights guaranteed by the Constitution," Marreo said.<p> 
			
			Under the provision, the FBI does not have to show a judge  a compelling need for the records nor does it have to specify  any process that would allow a recipient to fight the demand  for confidential information.<p> 
			
			Prior to December, the letters could only be sent to  certain financial institutions.<p> 
			
			However, legislation signed by President Bush in December  expanded the definition of companies from which information can  be obtained and allowed FBI agents to send out the letters  without first obtaining a judge's approval.<p> 
			
			The legislation allows the FBI to seek information from  businesses such as insurance firms, pawnbrokers, precious metal  dealers, the Postal Service, casinos, and travel agents.<p>
