<p>BRASILIA, Brazil - 

Burning of the Amazon
rainforest has made Brazil one of the world's top 10 polluters,
raising pressure on the government to curb destruction of the
jungles, scientists said on Monday.
<p>
 The government should publish within months a long-delayed
inventory of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions, which is widely
expected to challenge the view that the Amazon serves as the
"lungs of the world" by converting carbon dioxide into oxygen.
<p>
 Instead, it will show that a large majority of Brazil's
greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming,
come from smoke linked to deforestation of the Amazon, and not
fossil fuels which are the main culprit in most countries.
Paulo Moutinho, a researcher at the nongovernmental Institute
for Amazon Research, said the inventory should show that Brazil
produces around 300 million tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent a
year, 200 million of which comes from logging and burning of
the world's largest tropical forest.
<p>
 That puts Brazil above bigger economies like Italy and
Canada and among the globe's top 10 leading polluters.
<p>
 "The report will be thorough, but it will certainly put
Brazil in a situation where it will have to look more closely
at its emissions," said Moutinho. "It will be official
recognition of the large dimension of burning in the Amazon."
<p>
 Destruction of the Amazon jungle, which is larger than the
continental United States and home to up to 30 percent of the
globe's animal and plant species, reached its second-highest
level last year.
<p>
 An area of 5.9 million acres, bigger than the U.S. state of
New Jersey, was destroyed as loggers and farmers hacked and
burned the forest in 2003.
<p>
 KYOTO PROTOCOL

<p>
 Environmentalists lament the failure to stop the
destruction and many fear that expansion of roads and farming
in the region will only make things worse.
<p>
Carlos Nobre, head of weather forecasting and climate
change at Brazil's National Institute of Space Research, said
that under the Kyoto Protocol  to curb greenhouse gas emissions
Brazil is not obliged to cut emissions. Brazil produces
relatively little pollution from fossil fuels for its size
because energy comes mainly from clean, hydroelectric power.
 <p>
 "The only way Brazil has of contributing to a reduction in
global pollution is to cut deforestation," said Nobre. "It
would be a way for Brazil to participate in the spirit of the
(Kyoto) treaty even if it has no obligation to cut pollution."
 <p>
 Brazil has signed the Kyoto Protocol.
 <p>
 The government's general-coordinator of climate change,
Jose Domingos Miguez, said he hopes the report is ready in the
next two months, but that drawing attention to deforestation
was the wrong focus.
 <p>
 "Making deforestation the issue would turn the focus away
from the real problem, which is fossil fuel burning," he said.
"You can't have the focus on 200 million tons and take the
focus away from the United States, which is the big villain."
 <p>
 Brazil's position is that rich, developed countries need to
make the greatest sacrifice to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
 <p>
 Miguez said Brazil is doing its best to reduce Amazon
deforestation but it is difficult to change a "normal process
of land occupation."
 <p>
 He said Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions only represent
about three percent of the global total, about the same as the
size of the economy. The United States, the world's biggest
polluter and not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, produces an
estimated 25 percent of the global total.
