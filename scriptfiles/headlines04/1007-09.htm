<p>CARACAS, Venezuela - When Mamie Chow traveled to Venezuela for a one-week visit this summer, it wasn't to bask in the country's Caribbean beaches or tour its quaint Andean villages. 
<p>She instead stayed in Caracas' poor west side and spent the week visiting social programs and speaking with local leaders. A community organizer who lives in Oakland, Calif., Chow says she was drawn to Venezuela to see the "Bolivarian Revolution," President Hugo Ch&#225;vez's self-styled social reform movement.
<p>After watching a 75-year-old woman read her first words thanks to a Ch&#225;vez-sponsored literacy program, Chow says she knew she had chosen the right destination. 
<p>"Venezuela is the place to see a peaceful social revolution happening in real life," says Chow, 30. "You can't question what's happening here, it's so uplifting." 
<p>Under the leadership of the left-wing Ch&#225;vez, Venezuela has become a magnet for North American liberals and anti-globalization activists interested in learning about Latin American social movements. Ch&#225;vez's reform program promises to use the country's oil revenue to reduce spiraling rates of poverty, making him a hero for anti-globalization activists and prompting a burgeoning interest in Venezuela.
<p>With Ch&#225;vez promising "a new phase of the revolution" after beating out a recall referendum in August, Venezuela will likely continue to be a draw for U.S. activists much as Cuba was in the 1960s and 1970s or Nicaragua and El Salvador in the 1980s. 
<p>Elected in 1998 and again in 2000 on an anti-poverty, anti-corruption campaign, Ch&#225;vez has promised to reduce poverty through a myriad of social programs ranging from literacy courses to land reform. The firebrand populist paints the global struggle of the poor as a David and Goliath battle between good and evil, making him an instant crowd pleaser in American left-wing circles. And many think that, unlike other poor countries on the continent, Venezuela has a shot at making socialist reforms a reality because of its prosperous oil industry, now booming under record high prices. 
<p>"Venezuela has become a major source of interest for social visionaries in the United States," says Larry Birns, director of the left-leaning Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington. "The Latin American left was dormant during the 1990s, but it is now in revival, and nowhere is this more evident than in Venezuela"
<p>Though Ch&#225;vez has become a symbol for the left on the continent, his rule has bitterly divided Venezuelans into those who support his reform project and those who think he is taking the country toward Cuba-style communism. Critics say he has taken over state institutions, fired dissident government workers and used public funds to finance his own political projects.
<p>Tension over Ch&#225;vez's rule led to a brief opposition-led coup d'&#233;tat in April 2002 that was dismantled in two days with the help of thousands of Ch&#225;vez supporters. He quickly accused the U.S. government of plotting the coup, increasing his popularity among Bush critics and prompting the creation of Solidarity Networks that promote his social reforms.
<p>Ch&#225;vez also survived a two-month oil strike in December 2002 meant to force him from office, and last August he beat a recall referendum with 59 percent of the vote, ensuring that he will be in office until at least the end of 2006. Though the referendum was expected to ease political tension, the country's social polarization has remained largely unchanged, especially since opposition leaders insist Ch&#225;vez won the recall vote by fraud. 
<p>"President Ch&#225;vez is trying to provide poor people with health care, education and decently paid jobs," says Brenda Stokely, a union leader in New York City who spoke at a pro-Ch&#225;vez rally in Caracas in July. "Anyone opposed to that either has their head under a rock or has no respect for human beings that live in poverty." 
<p>Opposition sympathizers, however, rail against this ideological tourism as voyeurism on the part of middle-class foreigners with little understanding of what is actually happening in Venezuela.
<p>"These people are like 19th century anthropologists who travel the world looking for primitive cultures," says Amalio Belmonte, a sociologist and critic of Ch&#225;vez. "Then they return to their comfortable lives in the first world and repeat Ch&#225;vez's revolutionary discourse, but with no interest in finding out the other side of the story." 
<p>Belmonte says these tourists walk away with simplified visions of the opposition as nothing other than wealthy, light-skinned elites, ignoring that almost 4 million voters, including a considerable number of poor people, supported Ch&#225;vez's recall Aug. 15. 
<p>The Ch&#225;vez government has arranged visits by American celebrities, including movie actor Danny Glover, who visited Venezuela with a delegation of the TransAfrica Forum that celebrated Ch&#225;vez on his support for Afro-Venezuelans. Representatives of Venezuela's Foreign Ministry say that filmmaker and anti-Bush activist Michael Moore is slated to visit Ch&#225;vez this year.
<p>Venezuela has also become a popular destination for groups such as Global Exchange, which organizes tours around the world designed to show damaging effects of U.S. foreign policy.
