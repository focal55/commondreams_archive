<B>War came </B>to Washington with a vengeance last week. First there was the compelling evidence from former counter-terrorism tsar Richard Clarke that the Bush administration had fouled up in the war against al-Qaeda by failing to act against an enemy intent on attacking the US homeland. 
<p>Then, on the front of The New York Times and The Washington Post came the grisly images out of Fallujah showing the bodies of four US officials &ndash; hacked to pieces after being dragged from their vehicle by a braying crowd.
<p>Suddenly, President Bush and his team were not the reassuring guardians they purported to be in the aftermath of September 11; suddenly the war in Iraq was not a distant echo but a bloody reality. Clarke&rsquo;s evidence and the stark pictures of decapitated US personnel combined to present the White House with its trickiest problem to date in its self-declared war against terrorism. 
<p>It is not yet a &ldquo;Mogadishu Moment&rdquo; &ndash; a reference to the killing of 18 US Rangers in Somalia in 1993 which scuppered former President Clinton&rsquo;s ambitions on the world stage &ndash; but it has caused a hefty glitch in the administration&rsquo;s management of the conflict. Coming on top of two extraordinary reversals of policy, first to allow national security adviser Condoleezza Rice to testify under oath in front of the 9/11 Commission and then to allow access to the Clinton administration papers, there is a growing feeling that the wheels are in danger of coming off Bush&rsquo;s war wagon. 
<p>Inspection of the president&rsquo;s public diary during the last few months reveals an alarming ostrich syndrome. Despite the growing numbers of US casualties in Iraq, he has still to appear at any public honouring of the homeward bound body bags. There have been no flag-draped coffins, no honour guards and no commander-in-chief saluting the fallen. 
<p>Body bags are out of fashion but uniforms are in &ndash; as Bush showed when he appeared with turkey on tray at a Thanksgiving Dinner at Baghdad airport. The symbolism is of a tough, no-nonsense leader taking his people into a war against terror. But last week&rsquo;s events showed that not all is well behind the facade. While the broken bodies in Fallujah will be forgotten once brigadier-general Mark Kimmitt carries out his threat to round up the perpetrators and extact revenge, the fallout from Clarke&rsquo;s testimony will cause greatest damage.
<p>From the beginning of this key re-election year Bush has come out of his corner with the message that the country is at war, that he is the only leader capable of fighting it and that he has been cracking down on terrorism from his first day in office. According to the Bush camp, terrorism has always been the main priority; al-Qaeda would always be destroyed and the country made safe. There would be no conditional responses, just firm and unyielding leadership. 
<p>Now there is another version of the president&rsquo;s stewardship, and it comes from an official who carries clout. Not everyone in Washington warms to Clarke but nobody denies his experience. A career civil servant, he has served three presidents in the secretive world of national security and during that time had to pick up political skills to survive. Thought arrogant and quick to anger &ndash; he was burned last year when he was refused a key position in the department of homeland security &ndash; Clarke was accused of being too nakedly ambitious for his own good. Even the fact he had just published a controversial book stood against him. Enemies accused him of using his appearance before the commission to boost its sales. 
<p> 
<p>
<p> 
<p>But there is more to Clarke than that . His service to the successive presidents speaks for itself and, throughout last week, colleagues in the intelligence community were quick to defend him. CIA director George Tenet thinks highly of him and has backed up his revelation that dealing with terrorism was not a priority of the Bush administration during its first days in office. 
<p>Even Secretary of State Colin Powell refused to be drawn into the attacks by Vice-President Dick Cheney, who led the charge to belittle Clarke as being &ldquo;out of the loop&rdquo;. Interviewed in the aftermath of Clarke&rsquo;s testimony, and as the White House embarked on a damage limitation exercise, Powell confined himself to the observation that &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a smart guy, he served his nation very well, he&rsquo;s an expert in these matters&rdquo;. Then, in another volte-face, Powell added fuel to the debate when he conceded on Friday that some of his testimony to the UN Security Council weeks before the start of the war in Iraq was based on &ldquo;flawed sources&rdquo; and appeared not to be &ldquo;solid&rdquo;. 
<p>By producing a version of events very different from that put out by the White House, namely that they had terrorism under control and were up to speed on the need to counter it, Clarke has undermined the President&rsquo;s credibility. Before Clarke gave evidence, received opinion was that the war on terror would be the main topic in the presidential campaign. That being so, Bush would win because he was the only candidate who could prove he was tough and experienced enough to lead the country in crisis. In that sense, John Kerry&rsquo;s ambiguous attitude to Iraq came as a Godsend: here was a man who did not know his own mind and changed it whenever it suited him. 
<p>Clarke changed all that by exposing the Bush team as ditherers who ignored the signs al-Qaeda was about to strike, perhaps with passenger aircraft, and that the threat was imminent. Instead of repairing the damage done by the Clinton administration as it failed to deal with al-Qaeda, Bush&rsquo;s advisers had other things on their minds. Three months into the new administration, deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz was not impressed by the warnings presented at a meeting of first deputies and preferred to promote the view that Iraq was the greater threat. And even on the day after September 11, Rumsfeld insisted the US response should be extended beyond al-Qaeda to &ldquo;getting Iraq&rdquo;. 
<p>Clarke&rsquo;s response is instructive: &ldquo;I thought something was missing here. Having been attacked by al-Qaeda, for us now to go bombing Iraq in response would be like our invading Mexico after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour.&rdquo; In fact, the immediate US response was the successful attack on Afghanistan and the destruction of the Taliban, which struck a first blow against the al-Qaeda network. Clarke approved of that move but was not in favour of the attack on Iraq, arguing that it had nothing to do with the war against terror and only complicated US policy. Worse, not only was evidence of weapons of mass destruction flimsy, but operations in Iraq forced military commanders to take their eye off the ball. 
<p> 
<p>
<p> 
<p>As Clarke pointed out, it was a costly mistake which had repercussions elsewhere: &ldquo;The US special forces who were trained to speak Arabic, the language of al-Qaeda, were pulled out of Afghanistan and sent to Iraq. Intelligence platforms were also redirected.&rdquo; As a result, operations against the terrorists were diluted and Osama bin Laden and his cohorts remained at large. In the longer term that might not matter &ndash; Bush has always argued that the US is in the war for the long-haul &ndash; but Clarke&rsquo;s evidence reveals alarming evidence of a lack of crisis management when it was needed. Not only did Bush and his team ignore the scale of the threat from al-Qaeda, but in attacking Iraq they let themselves be diverted by a target that had nothing to do with terrorism. 
<p>Last week, as has happened in Iraq just about every week since May 1, 2003, when the war deemed to be over, US service personnel have been paying for that policy with their lives &ndash; at least 600 of them. So far the peo ple of the US have been prepared to accept the sacrifice for the country&rsquo;s greater good. They have responded to their commander-in-chief&rsquo;s call to arms and they have given him high marks in the opinion polls. So far they have been prepared to accept on trust his version of events.
<p>Now there is a new version, one that reveals the keepers of the watch might have been asleep when they should have been alert. And when they finally woke, they went after the wrong target. That, too, was brought home graphically to the nation when they picked up their morning newspapers and saw the charred and broken bodies strung up far from home. Previously invisible, the war was in full view, and, like Clarke&rsquo;s testimony, was not a pretty sight.
