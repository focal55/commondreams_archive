<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Marine Corps lawyer  assigned to defend an Australian terror suspect being held at  the Guantanamo naval base in Cuba Wednesday criticized the  military tribunal process and said it will not allow a fair  trial.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->Maj. Michael Mori, who in November was assigned to be the  military attorney for David Hicks -- an Australian held at the  U.S. military prison in Cuba -- said the system set up by the  Pentagon for trials of non-U.S. citizens captured during what  U.S. officials call the war on terror was unfair.<p> 
			
							"The military commissions will not provide a full and fair  trial," Mori told a news conference. "The commission process  has been created and controlled by those with a vested interest  only in convictions."<p> 
			
							"Fairness is extremely important in all cases, particularly  those that have commanded such international attention and will  have international impact," he said.<p> 
			
							Mori has met three times with Hicks, who has been held for  two years in Guantanamo Bay along with hundreds of other  prisoners detained during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.<p> 
			
							None of the roughly 660 prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay  has yet been charged with any crimes although Pentagon  officials have suggested that military trials for some could  begin soon.<p> 
			
							Most held at the base were arrested during the U.S. war  that toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan. Washington accused the  Taliban of harboring al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who is  blamed for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.<p> 
			
							President Bush authorized the military commission trials  two months after the Sept. 11 attacks.<p> 
			
							"STRIKING INJUSTICE"<p> 
			
							The tribunals have sparked criticism in the United States  and abroad from rights groups and legal activists who say the  procedures are designed to produce convictions.<p> 
			
							Mori agreed, saying, "Using the commission process just  creates an unfair system that threatens to convict the innocent  and provides the guilty a justifiable complaint as to their  convictions."<p> 
			
							Under the rules, the Pentagon can monitor communications  between prisoners and their lawyers, and there is no  independent judicial review process. Appeals go only to a  special military review panel named by the Pentagon, to the  secretary of defense or the president.<p> 
			
							Mori and four other military defense lawyers filed a brief  with the Supreme Court last week challenging the  constitutionality of the tribunals. In a friend-of-the-court  brief filed to the U.S. high court in connection with a suit  challenging some prisoners' detention, they argued that foreign  terrorism suspects being tried in the tribunals should be given  the right to appeal to civilian courts.<p> 
			
							Australia, which opposes the death penalty, already has won  assurances from the United States that Hicks and another  Australian detainee, Mamdouh Habib, could not be sentenced to  death. Both men would also be allowed to return home to serve  any prison sentences if convicted.<p> 
			
							Mori said the most "striking injustice" of the system was  that commission members, who take the place of an independent  judge, do not have the authority to decide issues that could  end up in the dismissal of a charge.<p> 
			
							Mori said although he and other military lawyers assigned  to defend prisoners at Guantanamo Bay had complained about the  tribunal system, their concerns had not been addressed.<p> 
			
							Mori, who said he called the news conference to draw  attention to problems in the tribunal system, said the existing  military justice system was a better alternative.<p> 
			
							"There is no valid reason to create a new justice system  only for non-U.S. citizens," he said.
