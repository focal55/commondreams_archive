<p>&nbsp;WASHINGTON -- For a dozen years, U.N. sanctions prevented Saddam Hussein from developing weapons of mass destruction and prompted him to give up those he had, the chief U.S. weapons inspector found.

<p>But they also hurt ordinary Iraqis and were weakened by corruption -- adding new complexities to the debate over whether President Bush rushed to war rather than giving sanctions and United Nations inspectors more time to work.

<p>When Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said at a hearing this week that "it seemed the sanctions were working," the chief U.S. weapons inspector, Charles Duelfer, demurred.

<p>"It depends on what you mean ... by `working,'" said Duelfer.

<p>Duelfer told senators sanctions not only took a heavy toll on ordinary Iraqis, but were weakened by corruption and could not have been sustained against Saddam for long. As soon as they were removed, Duelfer contended, Saddam would have been likely to resume his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.

<p>Democratic candidate John Kerry has said Bush improperly rushed to war when he should have allowed sanctions and inspections to continue to weaken Saddam. 
<p>Democrats say that argument has been bolstered by Duelfer's findings that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction, contradicting Bush's main argument for war. Bush has said he believes it was right to invade Iraq because Saddam wanted to produce weapons and could have passed them on to terrorists once he got them.

<p>But in this year's presidential campaign, the issue goes beyond the fight over Iraq. Whoever wins will have to deal with the nuclear programs of U.S. adversaries Iran and North Korea, and decide whether to use international sanctions in those cases, too.

<p>The Iraqi experience shows sanctions "are a very limited tool," said Rachel Bronson, director of Middle East studies for the Council on Foreign Relations.

<p>"They can probably slow down a country's program, but I don't think that the world can stomach the multilateral robust sanctions that are required to really shut down a program," she said.

<p>The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq as part of the agreement to end the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and Duelfer said they worked in two ways: They prevented Saddam from importing material to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. They also caused him to give up the weapons in hopes of ending the sanctions.

<p>But the sanctions also took a toll on ordinary Iraqis. To ease that, the United Nations approved a program allowing Iraq to sell oil to pay for food. But Saddam exploited that program to generate $1.7 billion in illegal revenue, Duelfer's report said.

<p>Saddam used that money to buy prohibited weapons and also to try to erode support for the sanctions, by currying favor with influential individuals and countries.

<p>His regime also made deals with six countries -- and private firms in a dozen more countries -- to buy weapons equipment prohibited by the sanctions. The sales included parts for long-range missiles and night-vision equipment, the Duelfer report found, although the sales were not enough to enable Saddam to rebuild his military or to produce weapons of mass destruction.

<p>Duelfer said sanctions weakened to the point that in 2000-2001, "Prohibited goods and weapons were being shipped into Iraq with virtually no problem." Iraq, he said, "was confidently designing missiles around components that could only be obtained outside of sanctions."

<p>But that weakening of the sanctions changed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. As the United States began stepping up pressure, Iraq became more isolated diplomatically and its revenues fell, the report found.

<p>Duelfer doubted the pressure on Saddam could have continued, saying it was "not sustainable" and "extremely expensive not just for the international community but for the Iraqis themselves."

<p>Echoed Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.: The sanctions "bought time but at the end of the day it was going to have a very sad ending."

<p>But Reed said the administration had presented a "false dichotomy" that the only two options were either do nothing or attack Saddam Hussein. Instead, the United States could have worked with other nations to maintain sanctions and rigorous weapons inspections, he said.

<p>He agreed there were humanitarian concerns about sanctions, but said that had to be compared with the turmoil the Iraqi people now face because of the U.S. military campaign.
