<!--/endimage/-->Cortright and Jacob are the first couple to jointly receive the recognition.</p>
<p>"Our organization picked them because we thought it was really important to recognize that they've been working their whole lives for peace," said Yael Petretti, PEP executive director. "It was not a tough decision to make this year. It was pretty unanimous."</p>
<p>Cortright and Jacob met on the PEP Mississippi Peace Cruise in 1986 and were married three years later, when they jointly pursued peace activism."I was totally surprised when I heard about receiving the award," Cortright said. "I especially liked the fact that it was being offered to us jointly. My ability to be an effective peacemaker depends on my partnership with Karen</p>
<p>"This award recognizes his lifelong work and passion and mine as well," she said.</p>
<p>Cortright is a visiting fellow at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at Notre Dame and is president of the Fourth Freedom Forum headquartered in Goshen.</p>
<p>He has been active in anti-war movements and affiliated with several organizations such as the Win Without War campaign to stop the war in Iraq and the Washington, D.C.-based National Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy, a nationwide anti-nuclear weapons activist organization.</p>
<p>Cortright has written and been involved in the production of several books and has worked to expose what he believes are the shortcomings of the U.S. missile defense programs. Jacob has been an activist since 1979. As a young adult, she was secretary to Howard Frazier, PEP's former executive director, and participated in three citizen diplomacy tours to the Soviet Union as co-leader.</p>
<p>She is president of PEP and chapter president of Women's Action for New Directions (WAND) of Northern Indiana, serving on its national board of directors.</p>
<p>Jacob is a registered nurse and volunteers in medical programs for the poor. She is also a painter.</p>
<p>"I'm quite honored and very surprised (to win)," Jacob said. "My goal is to be as effective as I can be to making this world less violent."</p>
<p>The couple will be recognized today in Connecticut, where PEP's headquarters are, with a reception and a ceremony during which they will be presented with a picture of a cornucopia by artist Martha Link Walsh.</p>
<p>The cornucopia symbolizes male and females working together.</p>
<p>Like Gandhi, the couple say they will continue to dedicate their lives toward peacemaking.</p>
<p>"This is very strongly a part of our identity," Cortright said. "This is where we share and draw strengths from each other. ... (the) Iraq war is so obviously wrong and unjust that we couldn't be true to ourselves if we didn't speak out against it."</p>
