LANSING, Mich. -- In a presidential election year dominated by war 
              and economics, environmental groups are determined to transform 
              such topics as clean water, forest preservation and global warming 
              into voting issues, especially in key electoral states like Michigan.<p>
              The problem, according to Carl Pope, national executive director 
              of the 700,000-member Sierra Club, will be how to be heard over 
              the &quot;shouting&quot; of multimillion-dollar television ad campaigns 
              sponsored by both major parties.<p>
              &quot;We cannot break through on paid television,&quot; Pope said 
              in a recent visit to Michigan. Instead, Sierra Club and other groups 
              will use education programs and personal contacts to raise the profile 
              of an issue where, they contend, the public is already on their 
              side.<p>
              &quot;... Our job is to point out to people that, A, we all know 
              what we want; and, B, we're not getting it,&quot; Pope said. &quot;We 
              don't have to have sewage on our beaches. We don't have to have 
              mercury in our fisheries.&quot;<p>
              National polls indicate that environmental issues tend to favor 
              Democrats.<p>
              Pope and others say pro-industry policies promoted by the Bush administration 
              have ended decades of progress toward cleaner water and air.<p>
              But a spokeswoman for President George Bush's re-election campaign 
              said the president isn't conceding the issue.<p>
              &quot;The environment will be an important part of this campaign 
              because President Bush has an impressive record on these issues,&quot; 
              said Jennifer Millerwise, a deputy director of the Bush-Cheney campaign 
              in Michigan. &quot;If you look at air quality, climate change, national 
              parks, national forests and a host of other issues, the president 
              has led and we've seen results.&quot;<p>
              Environmental advocates dispute those accomplishments. The president's 
              call for more support for national parks, for example, has gone 
              largely unfunded, according to the nonpartisan National Parks and 
              Conservation Association. And several groups say the administration's 
              market-based plan for reducing mercury emissions does too little 
              to protect public health.<p>
              Mercury is a potent toxin that can cause brain damage and birth 
              defects. It is released in small amounts through the burning of 
              coal, and ultimately tends to accumulate in fish.<p>
              Lana Pollack, head of the Michigan Environmental Council, said such 
              issues as mercury emissions could make a difference in several close 
              states, particularly if Republican environmentalists cross over 
              to vote for the Democratic candidate.<p>
              &quot;I think it's going to be an issue,&quot; she said. &quot;It 
              won't be as high as jobs and it won't be as high as the mismanagement 
              of foreign policy, but it will count.&quot;<p>
              Pollack noted that federal rules regarding tax-exempt donations 
              prohibit many nonprofit organizations from active political campaigning. 
              Instead, those tax-exempt organizations will continue the educational 
              programs they sponsor year round.<p>
              Noah Hall of the National Wildlife Federation said surveys indicate 
              that environmental protection laws are generally favored by both 
              Republican and Democratic voters.<p>
              A recent Michigan poll conducted for the wildlife group showed voters 
              rated the environment as an important issue, but did not put it 
              at the top of the list.<p>
              &quot;The economy and jobs was at the top. Education was second,&quot; 
              he said. &quot;The environment, clean water and the Great Lakes 
              beat out concerns over everything from gay marriage to welfare reform.&quot;<p>
              Hall, of the National Wildlife Federation, said environmental protection 
              bipartisan support among its 4 million members is about evenly divided 
              along party lines. But he said the national membership is showing 
              frustration over Bush administration policies, especially on such 
              issues as wetland protection, oil and gas drilling, and mercury 
              emissions, which directly affect anglers and hunters.<p>
              &quot;A large part of our constituency is hunters and anglers who 
              did support Bush in 2000,&quot; Hall said.<p>
              &quot;He came into office with overwhelming support of the nation's 
              sportsmen. He's done all he can to lose that support. His own advisers 
              and pollsters are telling him that.&quot;<p>
              Hall gave the administration credit for moderating a proposed wetland 
              policy last year, after a group of outdoor sportsmen met with the 
              president.<p>
              &quot;He recognized how important the sportsman vote is to his campaign 
              for re-election and he took action,&quot; Hall said. &quot;Whether 
           it's too little or too late remains to be seen.&quot;
