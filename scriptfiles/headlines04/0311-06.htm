Washington is paying the Iraqi National Congress exile group headed by Ahmad Chalabi about $340,000 (&#163;190,000) a month for intelligence about insurgents and other matters, US officials said yesterday. 
<P>Mr Chalabi, a former exile and now a member of the Iraqi governing council, pushed for years for the US to topple Saddam Hussein.  
<P>Before the war, his group directed numerous Iraqi defectors to the US to provide intelligence from inside Iraq that   critics now say was largely spun to alarm Washington into taking action against Baghdad.  
<P>Internal reports revealed that much of the information from the INC was either fabricated or useless.  
<P>But now, even with American forces on the ground in Iraq after toppling Saddam last April, the US government is still paying Mr Chalabi's exile group for information.  
<P>"We're still getting good information from them," one US official said. "There are a lot of insurgents that are doing bad things, and the INC has a lot of contacts and making better ones every day."  
<P>Mr Chalabi's group had provided information that had helped prevent attacks by insurgents, the official said.  
<P>"If we stop an attack and it saves one soldier's life or 100   soldiers' lives or 100 Iraqi lives, is that worth the price you pay?" the US official said. "Yes, they have been very helpful."  
<P>At a Senate armed services committee hearing this week, Senator Hillary Clinton, a New York Democrat, asked CIA director George Tenet about the continued payments. Mr Tenet replied: "We're not paying them."  
<P>She then asked Vice-Admiral Lowell Jacoby, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He replied: "Senator, you have me in a situation where this would be best dealt with in closed session. I could give you detail."  
<P>Mr Chalabi, asked about the payments in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes on Sunday, said: "It's a very small program in terms of cost."  
<P>Congress authorized the   funds for the "Intelligence Collection Program", which was transferred to the Defense Intelligence Agency from the state department about two years ago and mainly pays for intelligence gathering by the INC, officials said.  
<P>The CIA has been more wary of Mr Chalabi and his group than the Pentagon has.  
<P>The Senate intelligence committee, as part of its review of pre-war intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is looking at how intelligence agencies used INC information.   
<P>No banned weapons have been found in Iraq and it has become a key political issue heading into the presidential election in November, with Democrats claiming the White House exaggerated the threat to gather support for war.  
<P>US officials said last month that a major in the Iraqi intelligence service - who was a source for a pre-war US intelligence claim that Iraq had mobile biological weapons labs - had been labeled a fabricator. He was introduced to the Defense Intelligence Agency by the INC. Reuters
