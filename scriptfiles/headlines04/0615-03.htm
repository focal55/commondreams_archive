Janis Karpinski, the one-star general responsible for the  military police who ran prisons in Iraq when pictures were  taken showing prisoners being abused, said she and her soldiers  were being made scapegoats for abuse ordered by others.<p> 
			
			In the interview with Britain's BBC radio, Karpinski said  Geoffrey Miller, a two-star general sent to Iraq from the U.S.  prison camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, had ordered new  procedures in cell blocs where Iraqis were interrogated.<p> 
			
			"He said, at Guantanamo Bay we've learned that the  prisoners have to earn every single thing they have," Karpinski  said.<p> 
			
			"He said they are like dogs, and if you allow them to  believe at any point they are more than a dog then you've lost  control of them."<p> 
			
			The United States has charged low-ranking military police  officers commanded by Karpinski with abuse after several of  them appeared in photographs abusing detainees.<p> 
			
			The photographs and other reports of abuse have led to  hearings in Congress and fueled international outrage.<p> 
			
			But Karpinski, who has been suspended from her command for  failings at Abu Ghraib but not charged with any crime, said  military police would not have taken Iraqis out of their cells  to pose them for photographs without being told to do so.<p> 
			
			"I was absolutely sickened by those images. And I couldn't  even fathom a guess as to what happened to these people to make  them go so far away from what they had been trained to do.<p> 
			
			"But I will say I know my military police personnel ...  well enough to know they believed they were following  instructions from a person authorized to give them  instructions," she said.<p> 
			
			"We don't know yet who the individuals were that convinced  them that what they were doing was to enhance the effort  overall to find Saddam."<p> 
			
			Karpinski said Miller told her he planned to "Gitmo-ize"  the treatment of detainees, using a colloquial term for  Guantanamo.<p> 
			
			"He said every time we remove them from a cell (at  Guantanamo) there's two MPs (military police) that accompany  them. They have ankle chains on, they have wrist chains on and  they have a belly chain on," she said.<p> 
			
			"That was the first time I said to General Miller: Sir,  your conditions at Guantanamo Bay are different from our  conditions here in Baghdad and throughout Iraq. You have 800  MPs to guard 640 detainees. We have 1,300 MPs to guard almost  14,000 detainees."<p> 
			
			Asked if she was "out of the loop" she said: "I was in my  own loop. I was not in the loop that General Miller was  creating.<p> 
			
			"The intelligence operation was directed. It was under a  separate command and there was no reason for me to go out to  look at Abu Ghraib at cell bloc 1a or 1b or visit the  interrogation facilities."
