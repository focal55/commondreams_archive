<p>The leaders of the grassroots, Internet-based political phenomenon 
MoveOn.org were surprised when their national contest to create an anti-
President Bush TV ad attracted hundreds of thousands of participants.
<P>Now, the question is whether the winning ad, which will air next week in 
a $15 million campaign in key electoral battlegrounds, will surprise the 
political establishment by having an impact beyond what it already has 
achieved.

<!--/endimage/-->The winner of the "Bush in 30 Seconds" contest, one of the most visually 
arresting of the entries, is called "Child's Pay," by Charlie Fisher of Denver.
<P>The ad shows young children working on assembly lines, checking groceries 
and working as janitors. The ad concludes: "Guess who's going to pay off 
President Bush's $1 trillion deficit."
<P>It was chosen from among 14 finalists, each attacking the policies of the 
Bush administration in ads ranging from hard-hitting to humorous, and 
announced Monday night at a celebrity-studded gala in New York City.
<P>The ads, which can be seen at the Web site <A href="http://www.Bushin30seconds.org">www.Bushin30seconds.org</A>, are 
uniformly angry about Bush policies and allege that the administration has 
been less than truthful with the American people.
<P>"A lot of people are gravely concerned about the direction President Bush 
is taking our country," said MoveOn.org Executive Director Peter Schurman. "A 
lot of people have found creative, witty, poignant and powerful ways to 
express that concern."
<P>The contest was begun in December and was intended to tap a creativity 
outside the customary and exclusive circle of Washington media consultants who 
produce most of the national political advertising.
<P>"We thought we'd get a few hundred ads," Schurman said.
<P>Instead, 1,500 ads were submitted from all over the nation. When MoveOn 
members were asked to rate the ads online, more than 175,000 individuals 
participated, offering more than 2 million ratings.
<P>The result was the 14 finalists, which were submitted for final review to 
a panel of judges, including movie star Jack Black, Democratic political 
strategists Donna Brazile and James Carville, comedian Margaret Cho, author-
comedian Al Franken, recording artists Moby, Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Eddie 
Vedder of Pearl Jam and author-filmmaker Michael Moore.
<P>The winning ad "Child's Pay" is scheduled to air throughout next week, 
timed to appear before and after President Bush's State of the Union address 
next Tuesday. 
<P>MoveOn will spend $15 million to buy time on TV stations in "battleground 
states," where the voting could have swung either way in the 2000 presidential 
election, Schurman said. The ads will not air in California.
<P>MoveOn's plans represent a substantial media buy, said political science 
Professor Jack Pitney of the Claremont Colleges, but that doesn't translate 
into impact.
<P>"The flame burns hot but narrow," he said. "The MoveOn material in 
general and the ads in particular are designed to make angry people even 
angrier, but they don't necessarily broaden the anti-Bush coalition," he said.
<P>And, Pitney said, "it could complicate things."
<P>Indeed, it already has. Two the contest submissions, posted on the Web 
site along with all the others, equated Bush's statements with the rhetoric of 
Adolf Hitler.
<P>The ads were denounced by Republicans and others, and they were pulled 
from the Web site as MoveOn co-founder Wes Boyd acknowledged they were in 
"poor taste" and expressed regret they had "slipped through" the screening 
process and had been posted on the Web site.

<!--/endimage/-->Even without inflammatory Nazi imagery, Republicans found plenty 
objectionable in the remaining ads.
<P>"They should rename their contest '30 Seconds of Fear and Loathing,' '' 
said Christine Iverson, press secretary for the Republican National Committee. 
"There is not a single positive message in any of those ads. They're promoting 
protest, pessimism, negativity and personal attacks on the president of the 
United States." 
<P>But if the point of the contest was to develop sophisticated, anti-Bush 
TV ads built from the ground up, the 14 finalist ads have a style and polish 
that could compete with anything currently airing on television.
<P>And they hew closely to the basic liberal claims that Bush policies have 
produced job losses, skyrocketing federal deficits and tax cuts for the 
wealthy. The ads also accuse the president of deceiving the American people 
about the reasons leading to the war in Iraq as well as weakening 
environmental regulations and civil rights.
<P>Most of the ads are serious in tone, but there is the occasional touch of 
humor, such as "Hood Robbin'," by Nathania Vishnevsky of Foster City. Her ad 
depicts a man dressed in a Robin Hood costume and wearing a Bush mask taking 
toys from children, ripping down drapes to reveal a naked man and picking the 
pocket and stealing the cane of an elderly man. All the loot is turned over to 
a man at the entrance to a corporate headquarters.
<P>The contest is a project of the MoveOn.org Voter Fund, an offshoot of 
MoveOn.org, an Internet political action group created by Boyd and Joan Blades 
of Berkeley, who made millions from their own computer product  --  the famous 
flying toaster screen saver.
<P>Five years ago, frustrated by the national political dialogue they 
circulated an online petition calling for a swift end to the impeachment 
proceedings against President Bill Clinton, asserting that the country wanted 
to "move on."
<P>Since then, MoveOn.org merged with another similar organization, has 
grown to more than 1.7 million members and has become a force that can produce 
hundreds of thousands of online petition signatures advocating other policy 
positions.
<P>MoveOn.org is nonpartisan and under the laws governing its formation 
cannot advocate on behalf or against any candidate. It can, however, "educate" 
voters about issues and candidates, and in that regard it is clearly opposed 
to the president.
<P>Similarly, MoveOn.org Voter Fund can't involve itself in specifically 
opposing or supporting a candidate.
<P>MoveOn has formed its own political action committee, MoveOn.org PAC, and 
it will weigh in directly on political campaigns, Schurman said.
<P>But MoveOn.org Voter Fund and the ads, Schurman said, have a different 
goal.
<P>"The point is to influence voters  --  not to reach them through the 
elite media  --  and to educate them about the failures of President Bush's 
policies," he said.</p>
