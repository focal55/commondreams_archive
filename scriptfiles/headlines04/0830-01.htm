<p>NEW YORK - Demonstrators haven't come to Manhattan solely to denounce President Bush and his policies. At least two protest events are scheduled for the headquarters of big media companies later this week. 

<p>Organizers of the "<a href="http://www.marchonthemedia.org/" target="_new">March on the Media</a>" hope to draw attention to what they said is uncritical coverage of corporate scandals, terrorism prevention and the war against Iraq. 

<p>"Corporate media have failed to provide the public with critical, probing coverage of this administration," said Peter Hart, a media analyst at Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting, one of the march's sponsors. "The public needs a watchdog, not a lapdog." 

<p>The protest is scheduled for Wednesday evening and will target the offices of CBS, Time Inc./CNN and the Fox News Channel, all of which are within blocks of each other in midtown Manhattan. 

<p>Fox's studios on Sixth Avenue also are expected to be the site of a "<a href="http://www.codepinkalert.org/National_Actions_RNC.shtml">Shut-up-athon</a>" tomorrow. 

<p>Viewers of Fox talk-show host Bill O'Reilly, one of the country's leading conservative journalists, might recognize the phrase. 

<p>The demonstration is organized by the women's peace-activists group called Code Pink.
