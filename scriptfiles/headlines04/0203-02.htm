<p>LONDON - Tony Blair bowed to growing pressure  Tuesday, calling an inquiry into the quality of British  intelligence on banned Iraqi weapons but a key opposition party  refused to take part.

<!--/endimage/-->The Liberal Democrats said the investigation should examine  the political decisions taken to wage war, rather than focus  exclusively on problems with information from spies.<p> 
			
							Blair refused, sparking criticism that the probe would be  too narrowly defined to be meaningful.<p> 
			
							"I think it is right...that we have a look at the  intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or  not," Blair told a parliamentary committee. "We do not in my  view need an inquiry into the political decision to go to war."<p> 
			
							Until now, Blair has firmly resisted calls for an inquiry.<p> 
			
							But clamor has grown as nearly 10 months after Saddam  Hussein was toppled, no biological or chemical weapons -- the  reasons Blair gave for war -- have been found in Iraq.<p> 
			
							Prior to the war, he said Iraq posed a "serious and  current" threat and that it had continued to produce banned  weapons.<p> 
			
							Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told parliament the inquiry,  headed by former chief civil servant Lord Butler, would report  by the summer, well before next year's expected election.<p> 
			
							It will hear from witnesses in private and investigate the  accuracy of intelligence on Iraq's banned weapons and examine  any discrepancies between it and what has been discovered since  the end of the conflict.<p> 
			
							The official government line that evidence of banned  weapons could yet be found has proved increasingly difficult to  sustain since chief U.S. weapons hunter David Kay quit his  post, saying he believed Iraq had no stockpiles of illicit  weapons.<p> 
			
							"The government recognizes there are...entirely legitimate  concerns about the reliability of the original intelligence  which have been heightened by Dr Kay's evidence," Straw said.<p> 
			
							President Bush's decision Monday to set up an independent  commission on U.S. intelligence turned up the heat on Britain  to do the same although Blair denied being wrongfooted by  Washington's move.<p> 
			
							Conservative foreign affairs spokesman Michael Ancram said  Blair had performed a "spectacular U-turn."<p> 
			
							INQUIRY TERMS UNDER FIRE<p> 
			
							The failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has  dealt a major blow to Blair's credibility with the UK public.<p> 
			
							The new inquiry will frustrate his attempts to draw a line  under the most torrid period of his nearly seven years in  power.<p> 
			
							Critics say the government is preparing to heap blame on  Britain's intelligence services.<p> 
			
							"An inquiry which excludes politicians from scrutiny is  unlikely to command public confidence," Liberal Democrat  foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said.<p> 
			
							Blair, he added, should be willing to submit to scrutiny of  his "competence and judgment." The LibDems' refusal to take  part will embarrass a government seeking a cross-party probe.<p> 
			
							Last week, the prime minister was exonerated by judge Lord  Hutton's report on the suicide of a weapons expert, who was  outed as the source of a report that Blair exaggerated the  threat posed by Iraq to justify war.<p> 
			
							Blair said Hutton had cleared the government of acting  improperly in the run-up to war, so the new inquiry should not  return to that question.
