HAVANA&nbsp; - Cuban President Fidel Castro led  hundreds of thousands of Cubans in a massive march in Havana on  Friday to protest new steps taken by the United States to  squeeze Cuba's economy and topple its communist government.

Workers and students wearing red shirts and soldiers and  military cadets in uniform marched waving Cuban flags along  Havana's waterfront past the American diplomatic mission,  shouting slogans against President Bush.<p> 
			
			"Bush, you fascist, there is no aggression that Cuba cannot  resist," they chanted during the more than three-hour march.<p> 
			
			Authorities said one million people took part in the march  organized by the government to repudiate what they see as U.S.  meddling.<p> 
			
			Castro denounced as "ruthless and cruel" measures adopted  last week by the White House to step up support for Cuban  dissidents and limit dollar remittances to Cubans and visits  from their relatives in the United States.<p> 
			
			The 77-year-old Cuban leader, wearing his trademark  military fatigues and cap, looked frail and walked one mile  with difficulty, at times leaning on a fellow marcher.<p> 
			
			The U.S. measures aimed at speeding up democratic change on  the Caribbean island were the latest in four decades of  sanctions designed to oust Castro, in power since a 1959  revolution.<p> 
			
			"You have no right whatsoever, except for that of brute  force, to intervene in Cuba's affairs ... and proclaim the  transition from one system to another and take measures to make  this happen," Castro said in a speech that started the march.<p> 
			
			Castro said Bush had no moral authority to speak of  democracy and human rights in Cuba when his election to the  White House was a "fraud" and U.S. troops were killing  civilians in Iraq.<p> 
			
			"The unbelievable torture applied to prisoners in Iraq has  rendered the world speechless," Castro said.<p> 
			
			"GENOCIDE AND FASCISM"<p> 
			
			Marchers carried placards with photos of naked Iraqi  prisoners taken by American soldiers, with a slogan saying:  "This will never happen in Cuba."<p> 
			
			Another showed Bush in a Nazi uniform sporting a Hitler  mustache. A slogan said: "Down with genocide and fascism."<p> 
			
			Castro's younger brother and designated political  successor, Raul Castro, marched in uniform at the head of Cuban  army generals and officers.<p> 
			
			The government declared a holiday and brought Cubans into  Havana in buses and trucks overnight from the countryside.  Students were gathered at Havana University on Thursday night  in preparation for the march.<p> 
			
			In a move criticized as pandering to Cuban voters in  Florida, Bush decided to limit visits by Cuban Americans to  relatives in Cuba to one every three years and restrict their  cash remittances to immediate family members.<p> 
			
			He also prohibited sending money to government officials  and members of the ruling Communist Party, to deprive what he  called a "tyranny" of financial resources.<p> 
			
			Experts believe the new U.S. sanctions will barely dent the  flow of an estimated $800 million a year to Cuba, a vital  injection of cash for Cuba's battered socialist economy.<p> 
			
			Cuban authorities, however, suspended sales of all but food  and toiletries in dollar shops on Monday, warning of price  increases and tough times ahead, as they seized on the issue to  bash Bush's policies and rally support.<p> 
			
			Castro defended Cuban socialism which had achieved literacy  and educational levels of an industrialized nation and an  infant mortality rate lower than the United States.<p> 
			
			"You are attacking Cuba for petty, political reasons,  trying to obtain electoral support from a shrinking group of  renegades," he said in reference to Cuban American exiles in  Miami.<p> 
			
			"The United States should not interfere in our countries,"  said Veronica Jordan, a Venezuelan studying medicine in Cuba.  "Bush is poking his nose in places where he is not wanted."
