<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The White House said Saturday that President Bush plans to meet with only a limited number of representatives from the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, despite a statement issued Friday that suggested he would meet with the whole panel.</p>
<p>The new details surprised some commission officials and members -- who believed they had secured a promise from Bush for a private meeting with all 10 members -- and could add to the tensions that have strained relations between the two sides. 

<p>"While details of the private sessions are still to be determined, the White House does not expect the president to meet with the entire commission," an administration official said yesterday. 

<p>The official added that the White House had not decided whether a meeting would include only the panel's chairman, former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean (R), and vice chairman, former representative Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), or other members, as well. 

<p>Commission member Richard Ben-Veniste, a Democrat and former Watergate prosecutor, said it "would be important for all the members of the commission to have an opportunity to participate in an interview such as this. . . ." 

<p>"There is a significant difference in being present, seeing a witness in person and having an opportunity to ask follow-up questions, and simply reading a transcript or memo," he said. 

<p>Kean and Hamilton on Friday sent letters to Bush, Vice President Cheney and their predecessors, Bill Clinton and Al Gore, requesting private meetings with the commission and also welcoming the possibility of public appearances. The commission wants to question them about intelligence relating to al Qaeda before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and whether signs of an impending attack may have been missed. 

<p>In a statement later Friday, Bush press secretary Scott McClellan said that "9/11 Commission Chair Kean and Vice Chair Hamilton today requested a private meeting with the president to discuss information relevant to the commission's work. The president has agreed to the request. . . ." McClellan added that Bush would not testify publicly. 

<p>Commission spokesman Al Felzenberg said yesterday that the panel's letter was sent on behalf of the full panel and McClellan's subsequent statement had been taken as agreement to those terms. "The chair and vice chair clearly wrote on behalf of the commission to request a meeting with the whole commission," Felzenberg said. 

<p>Cheney, Clinton and Gore have also agreed to offer private testimony to the panel, commission officials said. The parties have not decided on details, however, including whether any of the four men will be asked to testify under oath. 

<p>The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, which includes five Republicans and five Democrats, has had a stormy relationship with the White House since its formation, which the administration initially opposed. The panel has twice issued subpoenas for government materials and has threatened twice more to subpoena the White House itself. 

<p>One major point of friction has been the administration's insistence on sharply limiting the panel's access to selected presidential intelligence briefings, which were shown only to Kean, Hamilton and two other representatives. A 17-page summary of the briefings, edited by the White House, was given to the full commission last week.
