<p>BRUSSELS  - The United States, considered an
environmental laggard by its critics, is unlikely to sign any
new pacts on climate change at a key environmental meeting this
month, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday.
<p>
 Signatories to the Kyoto Protocol  on climate change will
meet between Dec. 6-17 in Buenos Aires, where many
environmentalists hope new far-reaching targets will be made.
<p>
 Russia's recent life-giving ratification of the Protocol,
an international pact that aims to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases by 2012, has energized conference participants
like the European Union, seen as a world leader in the fight
against global warming.
<p>
 But the United States, which backed out of the Kyoto
agreement, feels it is too early to assign post 2012 targets,
senior U.S. climate negotiator Harlan Watson told reporters.
<p>

 He said the United States had many bilateral and
multilateral partnerships on climate change and spent billions
of dollars on related research but did not expect to make new
pacts at the meeting in Argentina.
<p>
 "We do not anticipate signing any new agreements," he said.
<p>
 Russia's ratification of Kyoto this year means the protocol
will enter into force in early 2005.
<p>
 Watson said the EU's goal of keeping global average
temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels was a "political judgment," not a
scientific one.
<p>
 Separately, Watson said the United States continued to
support a proposed site in Japan for the world's first
thermonuclear reactor.
<p>
 The EU is pushing for the site to be built in France and
has indicated it would press ahead without Japan if Tokyo does
not yield.
<p>
 Six partners including the EU, Japan, United States, China,
Russia and South Korea  are sponsoring the project.
<p>
 When asked whether the United States would support the
French site if Japan backed out of the contest, Watson simply
repeated the U.S. supported the project as a whole.</p>
