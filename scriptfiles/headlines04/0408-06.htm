WASHINGTON&nbsp; - Political objections to wider access  for a "morning-after pill" may result in restrictions that  intimidate women from using the emergency contraceptive,  according to an editorial published on Thursday in the New  England Journal of Medicine.
<p> 
			
			The Food and Drug Administration in February announced it  was postponing a decision on Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s  request to sell the contraceptive, called Plan B, over the  counter. A ruling now is expected by May 21.
<p> 
			
			Plan B can prevent pregnancy when taken within 72 hours of  sexual intercourse. Opponents of a switch, including several  Republican lawmakers, argue easy access to the product may  increase sexual promiscuity, particularly among teen-agers.
<p> 
			
			An FDA advisory panel of outside experts voted 23-4 last  December to recommend making Plan B available without a  prescription.
<p> 
			
			The agency's delay in making a final ruling "suggests that  the FDA's decision-making process is being influenced by  political considerations," said the editorial, written by the  journal's editor, Jeffrey Drazen, and two members of the FDA  advisory panel.
<p> 
			
			"The current delay ... may be followed by approval with  restrictions on its over-the-counter sale that are designed to  intimidate women who require access to this medication," the  editorial said.
<p> 
			
			Limits that have been suggested include a minimum age  requirement for purchasers, or putting the medicine "behind the  counter" and making women ask a pharmacist for it.
<p> 
			
			"A treatment for any other condition, from hangnail to  headache to heart disease, with a similar record of safety and  efficacy would be approved quickly," the editorial said.
<p> 
			
			An FDA spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  FDA officials in the past have insisted the decision will be  based on science and not politics.
<p> 
			
			"There are ongoing discussions on many topics" with the FDA  regarding Plan B, Barr spokeswoman Carol Cox said. She declined  to provide specifics.
<p> 
			
			Plan B prevent pregnancy using higher doses of progestin,  one of the hormones used in birth control bills.
<p> 
			
Shares of Barr fell 79 cents, or 1.63 percent, to close at  $47.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.
