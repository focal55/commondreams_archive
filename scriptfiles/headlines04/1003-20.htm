<P>WASHINGTON - Bush administration officials, in
the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, gave a one-sided view of
the case for believing Saddam Hussein  had a nuclear arms
program that ignored the doubts of their own experts, the New
York Times said on Saturday.

<p>The newspaper made the charge in an article about thousands
of high-strength aluminum tubes ordered by Iraq that leading
administration officials said were intended for use in uranium
centrifuges.
<p>"As the only physical evidence the United States could
brandish of (Saddam's) revived nuclear ambitions, they gave
credibility to the apocalyptic imagery invoked by President
Bush  and his advisers," said the article on the newspaper's Web
site.
<p>It referred to remarks by national security adviser
Condoleezza Rice  in September 2002 in which she said the tubes,
a shipment of which were intercepted in Jordan in June 2001,
were "only really suited for nuclear weapons programs."
<p>The paper said that before she made the remarks, "she was
aware that the government's foremost nuclear experts had
concluded that the tubes were most likely not for nuclear
weapons at all."
<p>It said the Energy Department experts believed the tubes
were probably intended for small artillery rockets, as Iraq
itself maintained.
<p>"Senior administration officials repeatedly failed to fully
disclose the contrary views of America's leading nuclear
scientists," the Times said, citing Rice, Vice President Dick
Cheney  and Secretary of State Colin Powell by name.
<p>"They sometimes overstated even the most dire intelligence
assessments of the tubes, yet minimized or rejected the strong
doubts of their own experts. They worried privately that the
nuclear case was weak, but expressed sober certitude in public.
<p>"The result was a largely one-sided presentation to the
public that did not convey the depth of evidence and argument
against the administration's most tangible proof of a revived
nuclear weapons program in Iraq," the paper said.
<p>A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment.
<p>But the campaign of Democratic presidential contender John
Kerry  jumped on the report, issuing an ad that said: "Here's
something new about George Bush newspapers report he
withheld key intelligence information from the American public
so he could overstate the threat Iraq posed. Bush rushed to
war. We're paying the price. It's time for a fresh start."
<p>The times story said the theory that the tubes were
intended for a centrifuge was largely promoted by one analyst
at the CIA , a relatively junior staffer who had a background in
mechanical engineering and operating U.S. centrifuges.
<p>President Bush has cited Iraq's purported cache of weapons
of mass destruction as the reason for deposing Saddam. No
weapons have been found.
