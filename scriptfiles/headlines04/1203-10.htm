<p>LONDON - British parliamentarian George Galloway,
one of the most outspoken critics of war in Iraq, won a libel
battle with the Daily Telegraph newspaper Thursday over its
allegations that he was "in the pay" of Saddam Hussein.

<p>
 High Court judge David Eady said the allegations were
"seriously defamatory" and awarded the Scottish MP &#36;291,000.
<p>
 He refused to give the newspaper permission to appeal in
the case.
<p>

 Galloway, a flamboyant figure known as "Gorgeous George"
for his colorful love life, was expelled from Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Labor Party last year after branding Blair and
President Bush "wolves" for their invasion of Iraq.
<p>
 It was the second time he had won damages over Iraq
allegations against him. In March, he accepted an undisclosed
sum from the U.S.-based Christian Science Monitor over a story
which alleged he took &#36;10 million to support Saddam.
<p>
 Speaking after the case, Galloway launched a tirade against
Blair and said the Telegraph had been given a "judicial
caning."
<p>
 "The Daily Telegraph has been held to account, and what an
account it has been. But when is Tony Blair going to be held to
account?" he said to cheers from his supporters.
<p>
 "Tony Blair dragged this country into a disastrous war ...
all for a pack of lies," he added.
<p>

 The case centered on newspaper articles in April 2003 that
were based on documents discovered in Iraq by Telegraph
reporter David Blair.
<p>
 Galloway said the articles "claimed that I had made very
substantial secret profits from Saddam Hussein and his regime."
<p>
 During the hearing, he denied that he was "a greedy crook"
who took cash from the regime of the former Iraqi leader to
fund a luxury lifestyle.
<p>
 The court watched a video in which Galloway told Saddam
"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your
indefatigability."
<p>
 Galloway said that with hindsight his choice of words was
unfortunate and that he had meant to praise the strength of the
Iraqi people.
<p>
 The 50-year-old Glasgow MP told the judge, who was sitting
without a jury, that he never took "Saddam's shilling" to live
the good life with a home in London, a villa in Portugal and
"at least a box of Havana cigars."
<p>
 The Telegraph said it had not claimed that the allegations
contained in the documents it published were true, merely that
they raised matters that needed investigating in the public
interest.
<p>

 Judge Eady dismissed the newspaper's claims that it was
obliged to put them into the public domain.
<p>
 "In all the circumstances, it cannot be said that the
defendants were under a social or moral duty to make the
allegations about Mr. Galloway at that time and without any
attempt at verification," he said.</p>
