Appearing for the first time in public since his arrival in
Central African Republic a week ago, Aristide insisted he was
abducted from his homeland, which the United States has denied.
<p>
 "The fact is there was a political abduction," Aristide
told reporters in the Central African capital Bangui, flanked
by his wife and Central African Republic's foreign minister.
<p>
 "This unfortunately has paved the way for occupation and
... we launch an appeal for peaceful resistance (in Haiti),"
said Aristide, looking composed in a dark blue suit. "I'm
choosing my words carefully: for a peaceful resistance."
<p>
Facing a bloody rebellion and international pressure,
Aristide left his impoverished Caribbean nation on February 29.
U.S. Marines are leading an international peace mission in
Haiti approved by the United Nations  to restore order after
days of looting and shooting following his flight into exile.
 <p>
 Aristide's comments came the day after suspected supporters
of the exiled leader sprayed gunfire into a crowd of thousands
of jubilant revelers celebrating his downfall, killing at least
six and wounding 18.
 <p>
 Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest, became a champion
of Haiti's impoverished masses when he helped overthrow the
brutal Duvalier family dictatorship in 1986. He said his ouster
was unconstitutional.
<p>
 "I am the elected president and I remain the elected
president," said Aristide, sitting on a red armchair. "I am
pleading for the restoration of democracy."
<p>
 Central African authorities have expressed annoyance that
Aristide has repeatedly accused the United States of kidnapping
him. The news conference appeared to be an effort to quash
reports that he was being held a virtual prisoner by his hosts.
<p>
 Aristide said he had never been a prisoner in Central
African Republic but claimed he had been held captive in
Haiti's capital on the February 28 and 29, prior to being
jetted to the former French colony.
<p>
 He brushed off questions about his ultimate destination
saying the important thing was to keep calling for the
restoration of democratic rule in the poor Caribbean nation.
<p>
 South Africa, which has backed Aristide in the past, said
last week it would consider any official request for asylum.
