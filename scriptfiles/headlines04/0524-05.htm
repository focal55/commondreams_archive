WASHINGTON  - The U.S. military should clean up  depleted uranium ammunition scattered across Iraq to prevent  future health problems such as cancer and birth defects, a  leading anti-nuclear activist said on Friday.
<p> 
			
			The Pentagon said it had not found any evidence the  material, which is so dense it can pierce steel tanks, causes  long-term health consequences. An ongoing study of 1991 Gulf  War veterans has shown no ill effects.<p> 
			
			But Dr. Helen Caldicott, a pediatrician and president of  the <a href="http://www.nuclearpolicy.org/" target="_new">Nuclear Policy Research Institute</a>, linked depleted uranium  to higher rates of cancer and birth defects in Iraq following  the Gulf War.
			<p> 
			
			Depleted uranium ammunition is being used by U.S. troops in  Iraq and could seriously harm civilians living there in the  decades to come, said Caldicott, founding president of  Physicians for Social Responsibility, an anti-nuclear group  that shared the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.<p> 
			
			"We should be taking responsibility for what is happening  over there," she told reporters at the National Press Club.<p> 
			
			The Pentagon should test buildings in Iraq for depleted  uranium, destroy ones with high levels and bury the material  underground, Caldicott said.<p> 
			
			The U.S. government also should compensate people with  cancer related to the material, she said.<p> 
			
			Depleted uranium is a byproduct of nuclear fuel production.  It strengthens ammunition and gives weapons twice the range of  ones using other heavy metals. Tanks made with depleted uranium  have proven impenetrable by enemy weapons, the Pentagon said.<p> 
			
			There has been controversy about it since its use during  the Gulf War and the Balkans conflict, including some claims  that European soldiers may have developed leukemia after being  exposed to the material in Kosovo in 1999.<p> 
			
			"We don't see anything from the science" indicating  long-term health problems to people exposed to depleted uranium  in the environment, said Dr. Michael Kilpatrick, the Defense  Department's deputy director for deployment health support.<p> 
			
			An ongoing study of 70 Gulf War veterans who were hit by  weapons using depleted uranium in "friendly fire" incidents has  found no major health problems for the soldiers or their 35  children, Kilpatrick said.<p> 
			
			Kilpatrick said research on potential long-term impacts is  continuing.<p> 
			
			"We are looking at it scientifically. We are keeping an  open mind to it," he said in an interview.
