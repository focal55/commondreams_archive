<p>WASHINGTON  - A Democratic senator accused CIA Director George Tenet on Monday of making false statements when
he said during public hearings that his agency gave the United
Nations  information about all the top suspected weapons of mass
destruction sites in Iraq  before the war.
<p>
 "All such sites were not shared, and Mr. Tenet's repeated
statements were false," Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan said in a
speech on the Senate floor.
<p>
 The CIA last month declassified the number of top suspected
WMD sites categorized as high and medium priority, and
acknowledged that 21 of those 105 sites were not shared with
the United Nations before the war, Levin said.
<p>
 A U.S. intelligence official countered that nine of those
21 sites had been "frequently" visited by U.N. inspectors
between 1991 and 1999 and they knew as much about them as the
CIA. Three of the sites were added to the CIA's list after Iraq
declared them to the United Nations, and three sites were
duplicate entries, the official told Reuters.
<p>
 The CIA did not know the precise locations of several other
sites and efforts were being made to develop more data on them,
the official said on condition of anonymity.
<p>
 Levin said if the public had known that not all WMD site
information had been shared with U.N. weapons inspectors it
might have reinforced sentiment that U.N. inspections should be
completed before going to war.
<p>
 "I can only speculate as to Director Tenet's motive," said
Levin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
Committee  and a member of the intelligence committee.
<p>
 "In other words, honest answers by Director Tenet might
have undermined the false sense of urgency for proceeding to
war and could have contributed to delay, neither of which fit
the administration's policy goals," Levin said.
<p>
 Prewar intelligence on Iraq has become a key issue in this
year's presidential election campaign, with Democrats
suggesting the Republican White House exaggerated the threat to
build its case for war.
<p>
 "We provided the best information that we had and the
notion that we held back information that would have been
useful is simply wrong," the U.S. intelligence official said.
<p>
 "The U.S. certainly did not hold back timely actionable
intelligence information from the (U.N.) inspectors," he said.
<p>
”It is an insult to the nearly three million Africans who died of AIDS during the time it took the administration to come up with it.”
