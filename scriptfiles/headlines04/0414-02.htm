<p>WASHINGTON -- In a broadside fired at the conduct 
              of the war in Iraq, a senior Army strategist has accused the Bush 
              administration of seeking to win &quot;quickly and on the cheap&quot; 
              while ignoring the more critical strategic aim of creating a stable, 
democratic nation.<p>
              While the United States easily won the initial battles that toppled 
              Saddam Hussein a year ago, the administration &quot;either misunderstood 
              or, worse, wished away&quot; the difficulties of transforming that 
              victory into the larger political goal, Army Lt. Col. Antulio J. 
              Echevarria of the U.S. Army War College writes in a new paper.<p>
              President Bush and other senior officials have consistently cited 
              this larger context for intervening in Iraq: establishing democracy 
              there as a foothold to transform the Middle East and win the global 
              war on terrorism.<p>

Yet the Pentagon's civilian leadership, centered in the office of 
              Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, focused &quot;on achieving rapid 
              military victories&quot; with a force &quot;equipped only to win 
              battles, not wars,&quot; Echevarria, director of national security 
              studies at the War College's Strategic Studies Institute, writes 
              in the paper published in March.<p>
              The military force that invaded Iraq a year ago &quot;proved insufficient 
              to provide the stabilization necessary for political and economic 
              reconstruction to begin,&quot; he writes. As a result, &quot;the 
              successful accomplishment of the administration's goal of building 
              a democratic government in Iraq, for example, is still in question, 
              with an insurgency growing rapidly.&quot;<p>
              The White House National Security Council and the Pentagon declined 
              to comment.<p>
              The paper, <a href="http://www.carlisle.army.mil/ssi/pubs/2004/wayofwar/wayofwar.htm" target="_new">posted on the Strategic Studies Institute's Web site</a>, 
              carries the standard warning that the views are Echevarria's own 
              and &quot;do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position 
              of the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense, or the 
              U.S. Government.&quot;
              <p>
              While the paper specifically criticizes the Bush administration, 
              Echevarria said in an interview that he wrote about the administration's 
              approach in a broader context. &quot;As a historian, I am looking 
              at a longer trend than just the immediate situation,&quot; he said. 
              Both the problem and potential solutions &quot;go beyond the Bush 
              administration.&quot;<p>
              Col. John R. Martin, deputy director of the Strategic Studies Institute, 
              stressed that the study &quot;covers multiple administrations.&quot; 
              By definition, he added, strategic analysis focuses on problems 
              -- not on successes.<p>
              But the critique reflects frustration among some active-duty and 
              retired officers about how Rumsfeld and his top advisers seized 
              control of planning for and execution of the invasion and occupation. 
              Indeed, Echevarria said the reaction to his paper from within the 
              Army &quot;has been pretty positive.&quot;<p>
              Many officers still are rankled by the treatment of former Army 
              Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, who last spring was sharply criticized 
              in public by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz for suggesting 
              the occupation would require significantly more troops than the 
              initial war. At Rumsfeld's direction, the number was whittled back, 
              with Rumsfeld and other senior officials arguing that &quot;shock 
              and awe&quot; would collapse any opposition and the Iraqi people, 
              as Vice President Dick Cheney said in a March 16, 2003 interview 
              on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; would greet U.S. troops &quot;as 
              liberators.&quot;<p>
              Military officers, by tradition and temperament, are reluctant to 
              criticize the civilian leadership, especially in wartime.<p>
              &quot;I know of the frustration of dealing with the ideologues in 
              the Pentagon,&quot; said retired Army Maj. Gen. William L. Nash, 
              a West Pointer who commanded an armored brigade in Desert Storm 
              and led U.S. troops into Bosnia in 1996. &quot;But these guys are 
              very loyal and they are not going to grumble.&quot;<p>
              Nash and others argue that the U.S. campaign in Iraq has gotten 
              off track by focusing on short-term military problems.<p>
              For example, U.S. Marines won tactical battles in Fallujah last 
              week, systematically sweeping city blocks of insurgents. But the 
              battles inevitably cost civilian lives and, judging by editorials 
              in the Arab press, eroded American legitimacy. At one point the 
              Web site of the popular Arab satellite television station, Al-Jazeera, 
              featured what it said were photographs of children killed by American 
              weapons.<p>
              Gen. John Abizaid, overall U.S. military commander in the region, 
              seemed to recognize the costs of negative press when he complained 
              Monday that Arab media were portraying the Marines' actions &quot;as 
              purposefully targeting civilians.&quot;<p>
              &quot;They have not been truthful in their reporting,&quot; Abizaid 
              said in a press briefing. &quot;American forces are doing their 
              very best to protect civilians.&quot;<p>
              Echevarria, a West Point graduate with M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in 
              history from Princeton University, served as operations officer 
              of a cavalry squadron, among other assignments, and has written 
              widely on strategy.<p>
              Historically, the American military has tended to &quot;shy away&quot; 
              from the difficult process of turning military battlefield triumphs 
              into strategic successes, he writes in his paper.<p>
              His words reflect the work of the late Army combat officer and strategist 
              Harry Summers Jr., who bitterly observed to a North Vietnamese officer 
              after the Vietnam War that &quot;you never defeated us on the battlefield.&quot; 
              That is so, the North Vietnamese replied, &quot;but it is also irrelevant.&quot;<p>
              As they struggled to understand the lessons of Vietnam, Summers 
              and others came to recognize that the concentration on individual 
              battles neglected the building and defending of a progressive democratic 
              government in South Vietnam.<p>
              In both Afghanistan and Iraq, Echevarria writes, the American effort 
              has mistakenly &quot;placed more emphasis on destroying enemy forces 
              than securing population centers and critical infrastructure and 
              maintaining order.&quot;<p>
              During planning for Iraq, he writes, &quot;senior military officials 
              argued that, while a small coalition force moving rapidly and supported 
              by adequate firepower might well defeat the Iraqi army, a larger 
              force would still be necessary for the ensuing stability operations.&quot; 
              Yet Rumsfeld and other senior administration officials &quot;dismissed 
              such arguments as old-think or perceived them as foot-dragging by 
              a military perhaps grown too accustomed to resisting civilian authority.&quot;<p>
              Fixing this long-term problem, Echevarria suggests, requires rebalancing 
              the roles of military professionals and civilians in strategic decision-making. 
              Moreover, he writes, the United States must develop a better capacity 
              for nation-building and stability alongside its warfighting skills.<p>
              Echevarria does not spell out what needs to be done in Iraq now.<p>
              Nash termed that &quot;a hard question,&quot; adding, &quot;it's 
              real easy to sit here in Washington and give counsel.&quot;<p>
              &quot;But once you understand that the political objectives are 
              supreme, you understand that you have to broaden the political coalition 
              internationally, regionally and locally&quot; to support nation-building 
              in Iraq, he said.<p>
              &quot;That's hard to do, and even harder if you have to swallow 
              your pride,&quot; Nash said.
