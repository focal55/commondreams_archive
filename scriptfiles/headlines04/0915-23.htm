<P>FLORIDA - Florida and Jeb Bush, the president's brother, were once more at the centre of a legal row over the presidential election yesterday, after Governor Bush's administration intervened to ensure Ralph Nader was on the state ballot. 
<P>Florida Democrats, fearing Mr Nader will take votes away from them, accused the state government of flouting a court order last Wednesday that removed the third party candidate and veteran consumer activist from the ballot, on the grounds that the group sponsoring him, the Reform party, was not a nationally recognised party.  <P>Mr Nader's lawyers challenged the verdict but his name remained off the state ballot pending the appeal. However, Governor Bush's secretary of state, Glenda Hood, has stepped in and submitted her own appeal which automatically suspended the court order, putting Mr Nader back in the running just in time for absentee ballots to be posted to 50,000 US soldiers and other overseas voters by a Saturday deadline.   <P>"This is blatant political manoeuvring by Jeb Bush to give his brother a leg-up on election day," the Florida Democratic party's chairman, Scott Maddox, said. "And it's just plain wrong."  <P>Once Mr Nader's name was on absentee ballots, the state government would use the fact to strengthen the case to include it on all ballots across Florida on election day, Mr Maddox claimed.  <P>Democrats also pointed out that Mr Nader's campaign had hired a Republican lawyer, Kenneth Sukhia, who worked for Mr Bush in the dramatic 2000 election recount, as proof that the Bush White House was conniving in Nader's efforts to get on to the ballot.<P>Democratic outrage was fuelled when Ms Hood's office blamed Hurricane Ivan, which is bearing down on the Gulf of Mexico coast, for its unusual intervention on behalf of a third party candidate.  <P>A hearing on the case had been scheduled for tomorrow, but the state elections director Dawn Roberts claimed that Ivan might make that hearing impossible, and potentially   deny Mr Nader's right to be on the ballot.  <P>"There remains a substantial question as to when such a hearing on the permanent injunction will be held, considering the track of Hurricane Ivan," Ms Roberts argued in a memorandum to county election supervisors who had just ordered new ballots printed without Mr Nader's name.  <P>Hundreds of thousands of Americans were being evacuated yesterday from a swath of the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle in the west of the state, in anticipation of the hurricane as it moved north-west out of the Caribbean.  <P>Ms Hood denied that the state government was taking sides, but simply intervening to ensure that nobody's democratic rights were infringed.  <P>"We are acting as an honest broker," the Florida secretary of state said  <P>Governor Bush's administration was the focus of complaints in 2000, when thousands of black Floridians were removed from electoral lists because they were wrongly classified as former felons without voting rights.   <P>Ms Hood's predecessor, Katherine Harris, was also attacked by Democrats at the time for summarily rejecting their appeals against the first vote count, and certifying the initial results which gave the state, and the presidency, to George Bush.  <P>After five weeks of legal wrangling, the US supreme court weighed in and awarded the election, by a one-vote majority to Mr Bush.  <P>This year, the state is being carefully scrutinised for its conduct of the election, and was recently forced to abandon the use of another felons list that was found to be faulty. Democrats and civil rights activists have pointed towards the use this year of computer voting as a possible new source of errors and fraud.  <P>Mr Nader won 97,000 votes in Florida four years ago as the Green party candidate, when Mr Bush was declared to have clinched the election by a margin of only 537 over Al Gore. However, some polls this year have suggested he would draw no more votes away from John Kerry than from President Bush.
