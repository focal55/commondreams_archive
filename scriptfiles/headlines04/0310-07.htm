<p>HAVANA  - 

The Cuban Academy of Sciences accused
the Bush administration on Tuesday of hindering scientific
research by making it difficult for Cuban scientists to publish
their papers in U.S. journals.

  <p>
 In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Cuban academy said:
"Only the free flow of ideas and knowledge between scientists
and academics of the whole world can advance science for the
benefit of all humanity."
 
<p>
 The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control
said last September that U.S. editing of or collaboration on
manuscripts from countries subject to major U.S. sanctions were
prohibited. The actual publication of a "camera-ready" paper
without changes would be permitted, it said.
 <p>
 On Tuesday, a Treasury official said while the government
wanted to promote free speech, laws prohibiting trade with
countries deemed hostile were in place to protect the security
of the American people and help promote democracy abroad.
 <p>
 The Cuban academy also protested renewed restrictions on
travel by Cuban and American researchers.
 <p>
 The Bush administration, which has toughened enforcement of
a four-decade-old trade embargo on Cuba's Communist government,
has denied visas to Cuban scientists and eliminated licenses
for cultural exchange visits to Cuba by Americans.
 <p>
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces the
ban on travel to Cuba, recently denied licenses to a group of
70 American doctors and researchers who planned to attend an
international conference in Cuba on coma and death this week.
 <p>
 The U.S. agency "determined that the applicants had not
provided sufficient information to qualify for the licenses,"
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
 
<p>
 The Cuban Academy of Sciences said the restrictions were
aimed at winning the votes of Cuban exiles in Florida, a
crucial state in President Bush's November re-election bid.
 <p>
 "Once again, the Bush government has stepped up its
anti-Cuban policy in an effort to please right-wing
Cuban-Americans in South Florida in an election year," the
academy said.
 
<p>
 Since 1962, Washington has maintained a trade embargo on
Cuba aimed at ousting Cuban leader Fidel Castro. But food sales
are allowed following an easing of sanctions in 2000.
