<p>VANCOUVER -- More than 15,000 demonstrators crowded together on a small Vancouver beach Saturday to listen to left-wing activist Dr. Noam Chomsky speak out against the presence of American troops in Iraq.

The demonstration was one of several across Canada and around the world to commemorate the first anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and call for the removal of troops from the Middle East country.

<p>"The important thing for us is that it's a struggle that we can determine the outcome, it's outrageous to leave it to the people of Iraq to fight this battle," Chomsky said.

<p>The American author noted last year's global demonstrations to oppose the war represented the first time in history that millions of people spoke out before a war started. He said he believed the military presence in Iraq could end if activists continue to stage demonstrations.

<p>In other Canadians cities, including Edmonton, crowds of several hundred to a thousand people gathered.

<p>Eileen Young, 60, attended the protest in Montreal with her son Ryan, 32.

<p>What we are seeing is American imperialism under the guise of (fighting) terrorism," she said. "Things are just getting worse for ordinary people."

<p>In Toronto, more than 1,000 people turned out for a rally; in Ottawa, about 300. Protests were also held in Regina, Winnipeg and Calgary.

<p>In the United States, protests were held in 250 cities by United for Peace and Justice.

<p>"It is time to bring our children home and declare this war was unnecessary," Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a New York City activist told a rally in Manhattan.

<p>Mayor Michael Bloomberg estimated the crowd at about 30,000 but organizers said later that number had grown to more than 100,000.

<p>Thousands marched through central London -- some waving placards calling Bush the World's No. 1 Terrorist -- and organizers said up to 300,000 people turned out in Rome.

<p>Hundreds of people gathered in Middle Eastern capitals to denounce the war, including Turkey and Egypt.

<p>Some 150,000 people demonstrated in Barcelona, Spain, officials reported. The new Socialist government repeated its intention Saturday to withdraw Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq, unless the United Nations takes charge.

<p>Rallies also took place in Belgium, Norway, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Denmark, Jordan, Bahrain, India, Australia, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, New Zealand and South Africa.

<p>As many as 30,000 people turned out in Tokyo to protest Japan's involvement in the war, organizers there said. The country has sent 1,000 personnel to Iraq, its largest foreign deployment since the Second World War.
