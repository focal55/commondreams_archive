<p>WASHINGTON   - The International Committee of the  Red Cross (ICRC) has accused the U.S. military of using tactics  "tantamount to torture" on prisoners at the U.S. Navy base in  Guantanamo Bay, The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/politics/30gitmo.htm">reported</a> on Tuesday.

An ICRC inspection team that spent most of June at  Guantanamo Bay reported the use of psychological and sometimes  physical coercion on the prisoners, the newspaper said.<p> 
			
			It said it had recently obtained a memorandum that quoted  the report in detail and listed its major findings.<p> 
			
			In Geneva, the ICRC said it would neither confirm nor deny  the New York Times report -- in which allegations of treatment  tantamount to torture go further than what the neutral  intermediary has publicly stated before about inmates held at  Guantanamo.<p> 
			
			But, in a statement, the Geneva-based ICRC said it remained  concerned that "significant problems regarding conditions and  treatment at Guantanamo Bay have not yet been adequately  addressed," and it was pursuing talks with U.S. authorities.<p> 
			
			More than 500 people are being held at the U.S. base in  Cuba, detained during the 2001 U.S. war to oust al Qaeda and  the ruling Taliban from Afghanistan and in other operations in  the U.S. war against terror. The ICRC began visits in early  2002.<p> 
			
			The Times said the U.S. government and military officials  received the ICRC report in July and rejected its findings.<p> 
			
			Asked by the Times about the report, a Pentagon spokesman  said in a statement: "The United States operates a safe, humane  and professional detention operation at Guantanamo that is  providing valuable information in the war on terrorism."<p> 
			
			The Times said the Red Cross investigators had found a  system devised to break the will of prisoners through  "humiliating acts, solitary confinement, temperature extremes,  use of forced positions."<p> 
			
			"The construction of such a system, whose stated purpose is  the production of intelligence, cannot be considered other than  an intentional system of cruel, unusual and degrading treatment  and a form of torture," the Times quoted the report as saying.<p> 
			
			Beatrice Megevand-Roggo, the committee's delegate-general  for Europe and the Americas, told the newspaper the ICRC could  not comment on the report submitted to the U.S. government.<p> 
			
			The ICRC has agreed to keep its findings confidential.<p> 
			
			Human rights groups and lawyers have criticized the United  States for holding prisoners at the base indefinitely and most  without charges or legal representation.<p> 
			
			The U.S. government has taken the position that the  detainees are "enemy combatants" and not entitled to the  protections normally given to prisoners of war.<p> 
			
			It has begun a process of holding individual trials, called  tribunals, for each prisoner to determine their status.
