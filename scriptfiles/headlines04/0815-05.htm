<p>CARACAS, Venezuela   - Venezuelans turned out early and in large numbers on Sunday to vote in a historic referendum that will either remove left-wing President Hugo Chavez from office or give him a new mandate to govern for the next two years.

<p>Even before polls opened just after 6 a.m. (1000 GMT), long lines of hundreds of voters formed outside ballot centers, which were guarded by troops. Some brought chairs to sit on, sipped coffee from thermos flasks or read newspapers.

<p>"Everyone is voting for freedom, for the future of our kids and to end all the hatred," said physiotherapist Mercedes Arrieche as she waited to vote in a wealthy east Caracas neighborhood.

<p>At some centers where polling was delayed by technical or administrative glitches, electors chanted "We want to vote!"

<p>Venezuelans are hoping the referendum in the world's No. 5 oil exporter will help resolve a long-running and often violent political conflict over the rule of Chavez, a firebrand nationalist first elected in 1998.

<p>But there are fears a disputed outcome, especially if Chavez loses, could trigger protests and violence. Early results could be announced before midnight on Sunday.

<p>Venezuelan voters were being asked to answer "Yes" or "No" on touch-screen voting machines to the question of whether the president should be recalled from office or continue his current term, which still has more than two years to run.

<p>Among the early-risers was Chavez. "This is a happy day for our participative democracy, our constitution and our people," he told state television from the presidential palace.

<p>Earlier, his supporters in Caracas had roused voters with firecrackers and bugle music.

<p>Both Chavez and his opponents have predicted they will win the referendum. The vote and its aftermath will be watched across the world because of Venezuela's importance as a major oil producer and leading energy supplier to the United States.

<p>STAKES ARE HIGH

<p>Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and several former Latin American presidents were leading a team of international observers at the Venezuelan referendum.

<p>At stake is the survival of Chavez's self-styled revolution, a populist government that has spent millions of dollars of Venezuela's oil wealth on subsidized health, education and other social programs for the poor.

<p>For his opponents, the referendum is the last opportunity before December 2006 elections to vote out a leader they see as a bullying dictator squandering Venezuela's oil resources to promote a dangerous, self-serving revolutionary project.

<p>The recall referendum is the first of its kind in Venezuela's political history.

<p>To recall Chavez, the opposition must equal or beat the 3.76 million votes he received when he was reelected in 2000. But if the "No" vote is bigger, he stays in office.

<p>If Chavez loses, a presidential election will be held within 30 days. The Supreme Court must rule on whether he could stand in that poll.

<p>Chavez has said he will accept whatever result is announced by electoral authorities.

<p>But the former paratrooper, who led a failed coup six years before winning 1998 elections, has fanned fears of a violent backlash if he loses by saying his supporters in the military and the oil industry will not accept a government formed by his enemies.

<p>Combined with events in Iraq, worries about the Venezuelan referendum triggering violence and possibly disrupting the country's oil supplies helped world oil prices reach record highs above $46 a barrel on Friday.
