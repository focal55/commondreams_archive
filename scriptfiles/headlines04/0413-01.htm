<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp; - The Justice Department under  Attorney General John Ashcroft failed in 2001 to treat  counterterrorism as a top priority, the commission  investigating the Sept. 11 attacks said in a report issued on  Tuesday.<p> 
			
			The commission staff statement focused on a Justice  Department document that set out priorities for 2001 issued May  10 of that year. The top priorities were reducing gun violence  and combating drug trafficking. It made no mention of  counterterrorism.<p>

      Former Director of the FBI Louis J. Freeh is sworn in to testimony before the 9-11 commission on Capitol Hill in Washington April 13, 2004. Freeh, along with Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Attorney General Janet Reno, and former acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard will testify at the hearing after revelations last week that the FBI was conducting 70 separate investigations related to al Qaeda before Sept. 11.

<!--/endimage/-->The report said when Dale Watson, the head of the  counterterrorism division, saw the report, he "almost fell out  of his chair."<p> 
			
			"The FBI's new counterterrorism strategy was not a focus of  the Justice Department in 2001," the staff report said.<p> 
			
			Then-acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard said he appealed to  Ashcroft for more money for counterterrorism but on Sept 10,  2001, one day before the attacks on New York and Washington  that killed nearly 3,000 people, Ashcroft rejected the appeal.<p> 
			
			The commission was to hear testimony later from Ashcroft,  and his Democratic predecessor, Janet Reno. The panel first  heard from former FBI Director Louis Freeh at public hearings  that were to continue on Wednesday.<p> 
			
			The report also focused on FBI failures to detect the  hijacked airliner plot, amid new revelations contained in a  presidential briefing that the bureau had some 70 separate  investigations related to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network  underway a month before the attacks.<p> 
			
			The newly declassified Aug. 6, 2001, briefing said the FBI  had detected suspicious activity "consistent with preparations  for hijackings or other types of attacks."<p> 
			
			The report found that despite increasing concern about  terrorist threats, the FBI was hampered by a culture resistant  to change, inadequate resources and legal barriers.<p> 
			
			"From the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, FBI and  Department of Justice leadership in Washington and New York  became increasingly concerned about the terrorist threat from  Islamic extremists to U.S. interests both at home and abroad,"  said the report, presented at the commission hearing.<p> 
			
			Significant FBI resources were devoted to investigations of  major terrorist attacks that resulted in several prosecutions,  but FBI attempts to strengthen its ability to prevent such  attacks failed to make changes across the bureau, it said.<p> 
			
			FBI HOBBLED<p> 
			
			"On September 11, 2001, the FBI was limited in several  areas critical to an effective, preventive counterterrorism  strategy," it said, citing limited intelligence collection and  analysis capabilities, limited information sharing,  insufficient training, an overly complex legal regime and  inadequate resources.<p> 
			
			The FBI worked hard on terrorist financing investigations,  and before Sept. 11 agents understood there was a network of  extremist organizations operating within the United States  supporting a global Islamic jihad movement, the report said.<p> 
			
			But they did not know the degree to which those extremist  groups were associated with al Qaeda, the report said.<p> 
			
			While many of the groups appeared to have some connection  to bin Laden, FBI agents had little hope they would be able to  make a criminal case or disrupt the operation because of rules  making distinctions between gathering intelligence and building  criminal cases.<p> 
			
			In the years before the attacks, counterterrorism  investigations that generally resulted in fewer prosecutions  "were viewed as backwaters" because FBI agents were rewarded  based on arrests, indictments, and prosecutions, the report  said.<p> 
			
			Agents developed information for their own cases and the  poor state of the FBI's information systems meant agents  "usually did not know what investigations agents in their own  office, let alone in other field offices, were working on."<p> 
			
			"As a result, it was almost impossible to develop an  understanding of the threat from a particular international  terrorist group," the report said.<p> 
			
			Although the FBI's counterterrorism budget tripled during  the mid-1990s, its counterterrorism spending stayed fairly  constant between fiscal years 1998 and 2001, it added.<p> 
			
			On Sept. 11, 2001, only about 1,300 agents, or 6 percent of  the FBI's total personnel, worked on counterterrorism.
			<p> 
			
			"Former FBI officials told us that prior to 9/11, there was  not sufficient national commitment or political will to  dedicate the necessary resources to counterterrorism," the  report said.
