NEW PALTZ, N.Y. - The battle over gay marriage in  the United States spread on Friday to a small New York town  whose mayor began marrying same-sex couples in the first such  ceremonies in the state.
<p> 
			
			The weddings in the village of New Paltz, about 80 miles  north of Manhattan, came on the day California's attorney  general planned to ask that state's Supreme Court to rule on  the legality of over 3,300 gay weddings in the past two weeks  in San Francisco.
<p> 
			
			New Paltz Mayor Jason West -- the state's first elected  Green Party mayor -- married couples in a festive atmosphere  outside Village Hall in what the 26-year-old official has  described as "legal marriage ceremonies." West officiated at 19  gay weddings on Friday.
<p> 
			
			Some 200 people cheered and held up placards saying:  "Congratulations" and "Bush Get Out of My Bedroom," while a  much smaller group of protesters held signs saying: "Gay  Marriage is Morally Wrong" and "Pray for Them."
<p> 
			
			Among those who tied the knot in the tiny college town were  Billiam van Rostenberg, 39, from Long Island, and Major Jeffrey  McGowan, 38.
<p> 
			
			"My whole life I felt discriminated against. I feel a great  sense of relief. I am very happy," van Rostenberg said after  his nuptials to his partner of six years. "We live in a country  where good things can still happen."
<p> 
			
			West ended each ceremony saying, "By the powers vested in  me by the state of New York, I now declare you legally wed,"  altering the normal "husband and wife" ending to that phrase.
<p> 
			
			Gov. George Pataki told reporters in New York that state  law defines marriage as "between a man and a woman.
<p> 
			
			"If people want to change the law, that's (a matter) for  the legislature," Pataki said.
<p> 
			
			New York's Department of Health said in a statement it  asked State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to seek an  injunction against the New Paltz mayor and to declare the  weddings "null and void." A spokesman for Spitzer's office said  the request was denied because no "immediate and irreparable  injury or harm has been caused."
<p> 
			
			ELECTION-YEAR ISSUE
<p> 
			
			Gay marriage has become a contentious election-year issue.
<p> 
			
			Weddings in San Francisco grabbed media attention after  that city's mayor defied state law to allow gay nuptials. On  Thursday, comedian Rosie O'Donnell married her domestic partner  in San Francisco, long a center of gay rights.
<p> 
			
			A New Mexico county also granted same-sex marriage licenses  recently.
<p> 
			
			Massachusetts' top court has ordered lawmakers to allow gay  marriages by mid-May, saying anything less than fully fledged  marriage would make gays second-class citizens.
<p> 
			
			President Bush said this week he would support a  constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between  a man and a woman.
<p> 
			
			Some of those in New Paltz said they rushed from as far  away as New Jersey and Long Island after hearing of the planned  weddings hours earlier. More couples showed up than West said  he would be able to marry on Friday, forcing him to turn some  away.
<p> 
			
			The marriages went ahead even though the town's clerk had  refused to issue the couples with state marriage licenses.
<p> 
			
			Gays in Long Island said they would push for gay marriage  next week, organizing an effort to march into dozens of town  clerk offices until they find one who will marry them.
<p> 
			
			If none agreed, Long Island Coalition for Same-Sex Marriage  Executive Director David Kilmnick said the group will file a  lawsuit on the grounds the New York state Constitution bans  discrimination.
<p> 
			
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told WABC radio he had no  plans to offer gay marriage in America's most-populous city.
