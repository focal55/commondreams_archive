<!--/endimage/-->In the Gaza Strip, two Palestinian gunmen killed an Israeli  soldier at an industrial zone on the border that is a rare  example of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation amid conflict.  Israeli security personnel then shot the gunmen dead.
<P>
Witnesses in the West Bank village of Biddo said Israeli  forces opened fire in a confrontation with stone-throwers,  killing two Palestinians.
<P>
The crowd was protesting over the start of construction of  a section of the barrier at Biddo two days ago, and the  demonstrations later spread to two nearby villages.
<P>
An Israeli police spokesman said he had no reports of live  fire during the incident and that three policemen were injured.  The army, whose units also regularly patrol the area and join  forces with police operations, did not immediately comment.
<P>
A Reuters cameraman said police had fired in the air and  used tear gas and stun grenades against a crowd of hundreds.  The police spokesman said at least three Palestinians were  arrested.
<P>
The two men killed in Biddo were the first to die in  sporadic demonstrations in the past few months against the West  Bank barrier, a project Israel says keeps suicide bombers out  of its cities and which Palestinians call a land grab.
<P>
At the behest of the U.N. General Assembly, the  International Court of Justice held three days of hearings in  The Hague this week into the legality of the barrier, which  snakes into Israeli-occupied land Palestinians want for a  state.
<P>
GAZA CLAIM
<P>
Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, armed groups in Palestinian  President Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, claimed responsibility  for what they called a "martyrdom operation" at the Erez border  crossing in the Gaza Strip.
<P>
The early morning attack, which an Israeli security source  said wounded at least two other Israelis, coincided with the  first meetings in three years of Fatah's Revolutionary Council,  a key decision-making body, in the West Bank city of Ramallah.</p>
