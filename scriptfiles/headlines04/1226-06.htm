<p>KIEV, Ukraine  - 

Exit polls in the re-run of
Ukraine's presidential election Sunday said liberal challenger
Viktor Yushchenko had beaten Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich
by a wide margin.
<p>
 Yushchenko, who called crowds of supporters into the
streets to denounce cheating in the last poll, scored 56.5
percent to 41.3 percent for Yanukovich, according to a poll by
the Kiev International Institute for Sociology and the Razumkov
Center.
 
<p>
 A second poll, by the Center for Social Monitoring, gave
him an even wider lead -- putting his share of the vote at 58.1
percent and Yanukovich's at 38.4 percent.
 
<p>
 Yanukovich had initially been declared the winner in last
month's run-off vote, but his victory was overturned by the
Supreme Court which agreed with opposition charges that the
election was rigged in his favor.
 
<p>
 The figures in the first exit poll represented 80 percent
of a sample of 30,000 voters who were polled across the former
Soviet republic. The second exit poll surveyed 13,000 voters.
