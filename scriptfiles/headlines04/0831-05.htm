<p>NEW YORK   -- Protesters arrested for demonstrating against the Republican National Convention had been manhandled by police and were kept in a dingy holding facility for as long as 30 hours without adequate legal representation, according to attorneys with the National Lawyers Guild. 
<p>Members of the guild held a press conference Monday alleging that police had prevented arrestees from consulting with lawyers and that some were held beyond the legal limit of 24 hours before being brought before a judge or issued a summons. 
<p>Yetta Kurland, a guild member, said reports of mistreatment of protesters included a complaint that an eight-week pregnant woman had not been given food or drink and a complaint that a woman with a broken foot was among five detained women daisy chained together. 
<p>Protesters and lawyers volunteering as legal observers to oversee protesters' rights said officers had treated them roughly, and complained about conditions at Pier 57, a former parking garage where arrestees are processed. 
<p>"I was heavily thrown to the ground - although I did have my legal observer hat on - by a police officer," observer Simone Levine said at the press conference. 
<p>Some protesters said there were only two portable toilets at the pier and that holding pens were circled with razor wire. 
<p>Since protests began Thursday, 548 people have been arrested, mostly on misdemeanor charges. 
<p>City Councilman Charles Barron said he was outraged that lawyers were being prevented from meeting with arrested protesters. 
<p>He also complained about police use of nets to trap and then arrest protesters. 
<p>"We're not animals," he said. 
<p>In a statement, NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said officers had been "restrained and professional throughout. The single largest factor in delaying the release of arrested demonstrators is their refusal to identify themselves." 
<p>Contrary to some protesters' accounts, Browne said those arrested had been allowed to make telephone calls. </p>
