<p>President Bush signed into  law yesterday an African trade agreement long championed by Seattle's lawmaker, U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott.
<p>
But McDermott was not invited to the White House signing ceremony, a disappointing cap to years of effort.
<p>
"It's too bad that kind of thing has to happen," said McDermott's spokesman, Mike DeCesare, who added that his boss was "disappointed."
<p>
The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) maintains lower tariffs on garments manufactured in 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
<p>
 McDermott is known in some diplomatic circle as the "father of AGOA" for his long support of the measure.
<p>
But McDermott  also has been a vociferious Bush critic, and he's featured  in the anti-Bush movie "Fahrenheit 9/11."
<p>
A congressional committee included McDermott on a list of invitees submitted to the White House ceremony. But when McDermott's office checked with the White House yesterday, McDermott was not among the invitees.
<p>
A Bush spokesman  said: "The White House was pleased to invite the leaders of the Ways and Means Committee to the signing." He would not elaborate.
