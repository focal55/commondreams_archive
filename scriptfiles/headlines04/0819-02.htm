<p>NAJAF, Iraq  - Iraq's government warned Shi'ite  cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on Thursday he would face a military  strike within hours unless he ended an uprising, disarmed his  militia and quit a shrine in the city of Najaf.
<p> 
			
In Baghdad, U.S. troops overran the firebrand cleric's  stronghold in the sprawling Shi'ite slum of Sadr City with  tanks and armored vehicles, meeting little resistance.<p>

A spokesman for Sadr said he wanted the government to send  a negotiator to work out details for ending the two-week crisis  in Najaf, which has dented the authority of interim Prime  Minister Iyad Allawi, killed hundreds and rattled world oil  markets.<p> 
			
			"Sayyed Moqtada (al-Sadr) requests a negotiator to agree on  arrangements to implement the demands," spokesman Sheikh Ahmed  al-Sheibani told Reuters.<p> 
			
			Iraqi Minister of State Kasim Daoud told a news conference  in Najaf the government had exhausted all peaceful means to  persuade Sadr to back down and was determined to impose a  military solution unless he abandoned violence, handed in  weapons and left the Imam Ali Mosque.<p> 
			
			He said the scion of a respected Shi'ite clerical dynasty  was facing his "final hours" before an attack.<p> 
			
			Daoud vowed to liberate the shrine, but declined to say  whether the government would storm the country's holiest  Shi'ite site, where Sadr and his militia are holed up.<p> 
			
			Any assault could provoke outrage among Iraq's majority  Shi'ite community, especially if U.S. forces are involved.<p> 
			
			Earlier in Najaf, explosions and sniper fire echoed around  the southern city's holy sites.<p> 
			
			Sadr said on Wednesday his militia forces would disarm and  leave the mosque if a truce was agreed with 2,000 U.S. marines  encircling the city, who have pounded his militia for two weeks  with warplanes, helicopter gunships and tanks.<p> 
			
			Sadr made his apparent concession after the government  threatened to storm the shrine to teach the Mehdi militia "a  lesson they will never forget."<p> 
			
			WILL BE BACK DOWN?<p> 
			
			He has since refused to budge, arousing skepticism among  U.S. officials that he will back down.<p> 
			
			"I don't think we can trust al-Sadr. I think we have to see  action, not just words," National Security Adviser Condoleezza  Rice told Fox News on hearing of the deal.<p> 
			
			Most Najaf residents were skeptical fighting would end  soon.<p> 
			
			"What peace? I don't believe it. Look at this hell," said  Talib Moussa, a 35-year-old laborer.<p> 
			
			U.S. armored vehicles were deployed along the main roads in  Baghdad's Sadr City, a slum of two million people where fierce  fighting has broken out in the past two weeks.<p> 
			
			The area has long been a no-go area for the U.S. military  and foreigners in Iraq. Even former dictator Saddam Hussein, a  Sunni Muslim, used to treat the suburb with caution.<p> 
			
			"Sadr City residents, your government has banned all  militias in Iraq. Come forward and surrender your weapons,"  said a message in Arabic read from loudspeakers mounted on  Humvees.<p> 
			
			U.S. forces said they had killed 50 militiamen on Wednesday  in their push into Sadr City.<p> 
			
			On Thursday Shi'ite gunmen appeared to have stopped  fighting and melted away, witnesses said.<p> 
			
			Sadr, who had earlier vowed to fight to the death in Najaf,  has proved a wily strategist in past confrontations.<p> 
			
			Despite the plump, bearded cleric's youth -- he is about 30  -- the latest rebellion has transformed him into the most  recognizable face of resistance to the U.S. presence in Iraq.<p> 
			
			One U.S. marine was killed in action in Najaf on Wednesday,  the U.S. military said. More than 700 U.S. troops have died in  action since the start of last year's U.S.-led invasion.<p> 
			
			Al Jazeera television reported that Iraqi militants who  said they captured a U.S. journalist last week had threatened  to kill him within 48 hours unless U.S. forces left Najaf.<p> 
			
			It showed footage of a man with a mustache kneeling in  front of five masked men holding rifles. The channel identified  the man as Micah Garen and the group as the Martyrs Brigades.
