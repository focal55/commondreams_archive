"We have to revitalize grass roots democracy and it is not  time to stop now," Dean told a gathering of fervent supporters  in Seattle, where he attracted 10,000 people to a rally last  summer. That event made him realize at the time that "the fate  of the country might be in my hands."<p> 
			
			The former Vermont governor led the Democratic presidential  field through much of the fall and winter, but once the primary  and caucus voting started, he suffered a series of defeats to  Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.<p> 
			
			But that was behind Dean at the rally as he urged the crowd  to do everything possible to help Kerry beat President Bush in  November.<p> 
			
			"The truth is there is only one person to beat George W.  Bush and that is John Kerry, and I intend to do everything I  can to send George W. Bush back to Texas and put John Kerry in  the White House," Dean said.<p> 
			
			Dean said he would focus his energy on supporting his new  grass-roots group "<a href="http://www.democracyforamerica.com" target="_new">Democracy for America</a>," borrowing his "Dean  for America" campaign slogan.
			<p> 
			
			"My campaign for the White House may have ended, but the  need to take our country back for ordinary Americans is greater  than ever before," he said.<p> 
			
			Dean said he would continue to solicit contributions at his  new group's Web site <a href="http://www.democracyforamerica.com" target="_new">www.democracyforamerica.com</a> while  encouraging more people to vote.
<p> 
			
Dean promised that Democracy for America would encourage progressive candidates to "run for office at every level,"  raise funds for Democratic congressional candidates, build a  stronger base of support and "harness the power of the Internet  to enlarge and support our grass-roots organization."<p> 
			
			His most fervent supporters, gathered at a downtown hotel,  interrupted his speech repeatedly with cheers and ovations as  he unveiled the steps that his new organization would take.
