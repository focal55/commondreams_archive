<p>OSLO - Global warming  is heating the Arctic
almost twice as fast as the rest of the planet in a thaw that
threatens millions of livelihoods and could wipe out polar
bears by 2100, an eight-nation report said on Monday.

<p>
 The biggest survey to date of the Arctic climate, by 250
scientists, said the accelerating melt could be a foretaste of
wider disruptions from a build-up of human emissions of
heat-trapping gases in the earth's atmosphere.
<p>

 The "Arctic climate is now warming rapidly and much larger
changes are projected," according to the Arctic Climate Impact
Assessment (ACIA), funded by the United States, Canada, Russia,
Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Finland.
<p>
 Arctic temperatures are rising at almost twice the global
average and could leap 4-7 Celsius (7-13 Fahrenheit) by 2100,
roughly twice the global average projected by U.N. reports.
Siberia and Alaska have already warmed by 2-3 C since the
1950s.
<p>
 Possible benefits like more productive fisheries, easier
access to oil and gas deposits or trans-Arctic shipping routes
would be outweighed by threats to indigenous peoples and the
habitats of animals and plants.
<p>
 Sea ice around the North Pole, for instance, could almost
disappear in summer by the end of the century. The extent of
the ice has already shrunk by 15 percent to 20 percent in the
past 30 years.
<p>
 "Polar bears are unlikely to survive as a species if there
is an almost complete loss of summer sea-ice cover," the report
said. On land, creatures like lemmings, caribou, reindeer and
snowy owls are being squeezed north into a narrower range.
<p>
 FOSSIL FUELS BLAMED
<p>
 The report mainly blames the melt on gases from fossil
fuels burned in cars, factories and power plants. The Arctic
warms faster than the global average because dark ground and
water, once exposed, traps more heat than reflective snow and
ice.
<p>

 Klaus Toepfer, head of the U.N. Environment Program, said
the Arctic changes were an early warning. "What happens there
is of concern for everyone because Arctic warming and its
consequences have worldwide implications," he said.
<p>
 And the melting of glaciers is expected to raise world sea
levels by about 10 cm (4 inches) by the end of the century.
<p>
 Many of the 4 million people in the Arctic are already
suffering. Buildings from Russia to Canada have collapsed
because of subsidence linked to thawing permafrost that also
destabilizes oil pipelines, roads and airports.
<p>
 Indigenous hunters are falling through thinning ice and say
that prey from seals to whales is harder to find. Rising levels
of ultra-violet radiation may cause cancers.
<p>
 Changes under way in the Arctic "present serious challenges
to human health and food security, and possibly even (to) the
survival of some cultures," the report says.
<p>
 Farming could benefit in some areas, while more productive
forests are moving north on to former tundra. "There are not
just negative consequences, there will be new opportunities
too," said Paal Prestrud, vice-chair of ACIA.
<p>
 Scientists will meet in Iceland this week to discuss the
report. Foreign ministers from Arctic nations are due to meet
in Iceland on Nov. 24 but diplomats say they are deeply split
with Washington least willing to make drastic action.
<p>

 President Bush pulled the United States, the world's top
polluter, out of the 126-nation Kyoto protocol in 2001, arguing
its curbs on greenhouse gas emissions were too costly and
unfairly excluded developing nations.
<p>
 "Kyoto is only a first step," said Norwegian Environment
Minister Knut Hareide, a strong backer of Kyoto. "The clear
message from this report is that Kyoto is not enough. We must
reduce emissions much more in coming decades."</p>
