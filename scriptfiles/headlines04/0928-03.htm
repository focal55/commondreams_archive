<p>WASHINGTON  - Three years of the Bush administration's ''war 
on terrorism'' appears to have reduced the appetite of the U.S. public and 
its leaders for unilateral military engagements, according to <a href="http://www.ccfr.org/globalviews2004/index.htm" target="_new">a major 
survey released Tuesday</a> by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations (CCFR).

Indeed, the survey, the latest in a quadrennial series going back to 1974, 
found that key national-security principles enunciated by President George 
W Bush since the Sep. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and the Pentagon are 
opposed by strong majorities of both the public and the elite.
<p>

While supporting the idea that Washington should take an active role in 
world affairs, more than three of every four members of the public reject 
the notion that the United States ''has the responsibility to play the role 
of world policeman'' and four of every five say Washington is currently 
playing that role ''more than it should be''.
<p>
In addition, overwhelming majorities of both the public and the elite said 
that the most important lesson of 9/11 is that the nation needs to ''work 
more closely with other countries to fight terrorism'' as opposed to ''act 
more on its own''.
<p>
Similar majorities of both the public and leaders rejected Bush's notion of 
pre-emptive war. Only 17 percent of the public and 10 percent of leaders 
said that war was justifiable if the ''other country is acquiring weapons 
of mass destruction (WMD) that could be used against them at some point in 
the future''.
<p>
Fifty-three percent of the public and 61 percent of leaders said that war 
would be justified only if there is ''strong evidence'' the country is in 
''imminent danger'' of attack. For about 25 percent of both the public and 
the leaders, war would be justified only if the other country attacks first.
<p>
The CCFR survey, which because of its rich detail and consistency over the 
past 30 years is generally taken more seriously than others that are 
conducted more sporadically, queried nearly 1,200 randomly selected members 
of the public during the second week of July.
<p>
A second survey of 450 ''leaders with foreign policy power, specialization, 
and expertise'' -- including U.S. lawmakers or their senior staff, 
university faculty, journalists, senior administration officials, religious 
leaders, business and labor executives, and heads of major foreign policy 
organizations or interest groups -- posed the same questions to determine 
where there may be gaps between the views of the elite and the public at 
large.
<p>
The last CCFR survey was taken in 2002, and normally the next one would not 
be held until 2006. But the council decided to commission one for 2004, in 
part due to ''the significant role foreign policy issues are playing in 
American political life and the 2004 presidential election'', according to 
Marshall Bouton, CCFR's president.
<p>
The council also collaborated with similar efforts by partner organizations 
in Mexico and South Korea, the conclusions of which will be released in the 
coming days.
<p>
While terrorism and other security threats still loom large in the public's 
mind, according to this year's survey, ''there is a lowered sense of threat 
overall compared to 2002'', when foreign policy concerns, particularly 
terrorism, topped the list of foreign-policy issues that most concerned the 
public.

<p>
''Protecting American jobs'' was the most frequently cited goal of foreign 
policy in the 2004 poll (78 percent called it a ''very important'' goal), 
followed by preventing the spread of nuclear weapons (73 percent), and 
combating international terrorism (71 percent).
<p>
For the elite respondents, on the other hand, nuclear non-proliferation and 
terrorism topped the list, while protecting U.S. jobs ranked eighth out of 
14 options.
<p>
As for ''critical threats'', three out of four public respondents chose 
international terrorism, but that was down 10 points from two years ago. 
Two of three chose WMD, but that was also down by about 17 points from 
2002, and virtually all other threats cited in the survey declined 
substantially.
<p>
Thus, ''Islamic fundamentalism'', which was considered a ''critical 
threat'' by 61 percent of the public in 2002, was cited by only 38 percent 
this year, while the ''development of China as a world power'', cited by 51 
percent in 2002, claimed only 33 percent in 2004.
<p>
While, for the public, foreign policy issues virtually across the board 
were seen as less important than in 2002, that was not true for the 
foreign-policy elite, which rated ''combating world hunger'', securing 
energy supplies, improving the global environment, and, most striking, 
improving the standard of living of less developed nations, significantly 
higher than two years ago.
<p>
In addition, 40 percent of the elite now consider ''strengthening the 
United Nations'' as a ''very important goal'' of U.S. foreign policy, up 12 
percent from 2002. Conversely, the percentage of leaders who cited 
''maintaining superior power worldwide'' as a very important goal, fell 
from 52 percent in 2002 to only 37 percent in 2004, the first time it has 
received less than majority support since the question was first asked in 
1994.
<p>
A more chastened approach to foreign policy also showed up in declining 
support on the part of both the public and the elite for maintaining 
military bases abroad, particularly in hot spots like the Middle East and 
states linked to terrorist activities.
<p>
More than two-thirds of both the public and the leaders agreed the United 
States should withdraw from Iraq if a clear majority of Iraqi people want 
it to do so. As to whether Washington should remove its military presence 
from the Middle East if a majority of people there desire it, 59 percent of 
the public said yes, but only 35 percent of the elite agreed.
<p>

A majority of the public said Washington should not press Arab states to 
become more democratic; two-thirds said they opposed a Marshall-type Plan 
of economic aid and development for the region.
<p>
Large majorities of the public and the elite favor regaining traditional 
constraints on the use of force by individual states, including the United 
States, and oppose new ideas for making them looser, as often proposed by 
the Bush administration. At the same time, they favor giving wide-ranging 
powers to states acting collectively through the United Nations.
<p>
Thus, majorities of both the public and leaders oppose states taking 
unilateral action to prevent other states from acquiring WMD, but support 
such action if the UN Security Council approves. In the specific case of 
North Korea, for example, two-thirds of respondents said it should be 
necessary for Washington to get the council's approval before taking 
military action.
<p>
A majority of the public opposes the United States or any other nation 
having veto power on the Security Council.
<p>
The survey also found strong support for U.S. participation in a wide range 
of international treaties and agreements, some of which have been rejected 
or renounced by the Bush administration.
<p>
Thus 87 percent of the public and 85 percent of the elite said they would 
favor the terms of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; 80 percent 
of both groups said they favored the landmine ban; 76 percent of the 
public and 70 percent of the elite said they support U.S. participation in 
the International Criminal Court; and 71 percent of both groups said they 
back U.S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol to reduce global warming.
<p>
Two-thirds of the public and three-quarters of the elite agreed that, in 
dealing with international problems, Washington should be more willing to 
make decisions within the UN, even if this means that its views will not 
prevail.
<p>
Asked what specific steps should be taken for strengthening the world body, 
three-quarters of the public and two-thirds of leaders said the UN should 
have a standing peacekeeping force.
<p>
A majority of 57 percent of the public and a plurality of 48 percent of the 
elite said the United States should make a general commitment to abide by 
World Court decisions rather than decide on a case-by-case basis.
