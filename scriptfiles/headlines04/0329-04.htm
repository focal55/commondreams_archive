<p>The United States wants to transfer power in Iraq to a hand-picked prime minister, abandoning plans for an expansion of the current 25-member governing council,   coalition officials in Baghdad say.
<p>    With less than 100 days before the US occupation authorities are to  transfer sovereignty on June 30, fears of wrangling among Iraqi politicians has forced Washington to make its third switch of strategy in six months.</p>
<p>    The search is now on for an Iraqi to serve as chief executive. He will almost certainly be from the Shia Muslim majority, and probably a secular technocrat. It is not clear if Iraqi agreement on this issue has been sought.</p>
<p>Initial plans for enlarging the existing 25-member governing council, which has the task of appointing the cabinet, have been downgraded in favor of letting the present members get on with their job. Although the council may still be increased, the process need not be tied to the June 30 deadline.</p>
<p>Plans to create a three-man presidency - with a representative of the Shia, the Sunni and the Kurds - are still under way, but its powers would be mainly symbolic.  The interim government will serve until direct elections for a national assembly are held at the end of the year.</p>
<p>    A decision about how to pick an Iraqi government to take over when the Americans cede power  have been in turmoil for several months. An initial US proposal to hold unelected caucuses of regional "notables" to choose a council which would then nominate a cabinet, collapsed in disarray after Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the leading Shia cleric, called for direct elections.</p>
<p>   The latest plan is to choose a government after a vague process of "extensive deliberation and consultations with cross-sections of the Iraqi people".</p>
<p>Ayatollah Sistani said last week that he would not meet  any United Nations officials if the world body endorsed the transitional law.  One of his aides said on  Saturday that the cleric might issue a religious edict against any Iraqis who join the interim government.</p>
