<p>EXETER, England - Millions of people across the
globe are set to die early due to extreme weather events such
as floods and heat waves caused by climate change, a British
scientist said Tuesday.

 
<p>
 Professor Mike Pilling cited the heatwave in Europe last
year that killed thousands of people from a combination of heat
exhaustion and an increase in atmospheric pollution.
<p>"We will experience an increase in extreme weather events,"
he told reporters at the annual meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science. "There are
predictions of a 10-fold increase in heat waves.
<p>"The increasing frequency of these will inevitably result
in a sharp increase in the premature deaths of people," he
added.
<p>Pilling, professor of Physical Chemistry at Leeds
University in northern England, said atmospheric pollution was
like a plague stretching across the planet -- although far
worse in the industrialized northern hemisphere than the
southern -- as pollutants drifted from Asia to the United
States to Europe and back to Asia.
<p>But the sources of pollution were not just static. The boom
in air travel for example was contributing.
<p>"The biggest issue is climate change. We have got to
control it," he said.
<p>The problem was not just factories, planes, power stations
and cars pumping out dirt and noxious chemicals, but also the
burning of wood and fossil fuels -- whether for heat and light
or in forest and subterranean fires.
<p>Many industrialized nations have signed up to targets to
cut greenhouse gas emissions sharply by 2010.
<p>But Pilling said that Britain -- and London in particular
with its high concentrations of people and traffic -- for one
was going to miss two key targets covering emissions of
nitrogen dioxide and soot particles.
<p>"People will continue to be exposed to levels of pollution
that can cause ill health," he said.
<p>Ozone -- a shield from harmful space radiation in the
stratosphere but a poison to people in the lower troposphere --
was also on the increase partly due to global pollution but
also to local output.
<p>He said governments needed to tackle all causes of
pollution together, not one at a time.
<p>"We must continue to look to improvements in technology to
cut these harmful emissions," Pilling said. "But we also have
to change the way we live."
