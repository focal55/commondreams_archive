<p>Drawing from a long list of "alternative" medical therapies as 
diverse as the Atkins diet, acupuncture, homeopathy and prayer, federal health 
researchers reported Thursday that nearly two out of three Americans were 
using unconventional approaches to mend their bodies or maintain their health.
<P>When prayer is dropped from the list, the federally funded survey found 
that 36 percent of Americans over the age of 18 used so-called complementary 
and alternative medicine.
<P>"What we see is that a sizable percentage of the public puts their 
personal health into their own hands,'' said Edward Sondik, director of the 
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for 
Health Statistics, which carried out the survey.
<P>A snapshot of American health care choices in 2002, the survey concluded 
that 8 percent of the nation's adults visited chiropractors; 5 percent 
practiced yoga for health; 1.1 percent had acupuncture; and 1.7 percent 
employed homeopathy.
<P>The wildly popular Atkins diet, one of several listed as therapies in the 
survey, was tried by only 1.7 percent of those surveyed  --  but the study was 
conducted in 2002, just as the national craze for high-protein, low-
carbohydrate foods was igniting. 
<P>The survey of 31,000 Americans was conducted at a cost of $3 million over 
a two-year period and is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind, said 
study author Richard Nahin of the National Center for Complementary and 
Alternative Medicine, an arm of the National Institutes of Health.
<P>Skeptics of alternative medicine nevertheless questioned the scientific 
value of the survey. "I can't imagine why someone would invest so much money 
for something that has no significance whatsoever,'' said Dr. Stephen Barrett, 
a retired Pennsylvania psychiatrist who runs the Web site Quackwatch (<A HREF="http://www.quackwatch.com">www.quackwatch.com</A>). 
<P>A frequent critic of the NIH alternative medicine program, Barrett said 
it made no sense to include activities such as prayer under the rubric of 
alternative medicine. "Praying for one's own health is not an alternative 
medicine,'' he said. "Everyone who prays, prays for their own health."
<P>Therapies such as massage, which are labeled as alternative medicine, are 
often used by mainstream medical practices, Barrett noted. Hypnosis and 
"progressive relaxation," also on the survey list, are techniques used by 
conventional psychotherapists.
<P>Unlike earlier surveys that relied on telephone interviews, the federal 
study required that researchers visit the homes of respondents, who were asked 
during a 10-minute segment of a larger health survey about their experiences 
with a list of 27 different alternative therapies.
<P>The findings are consistent with those of smaller surveys of America's 
health care preferences, such as the work of Harvard Medical School researcher 
Dr. David Eisenberg, who has reported the prevalence of complementary and 
alternative medicine in the United States has risen to 42 percent, from 33 
percent in 1990.
<P>The federal survey broadened the previous academic work by including 
prayer in the alternative medicine mix. It found 43 percent of Americans had 
prayed for their own health during 2002; 24 percent reported that other people 
had prayed for them; and nearly 10 percent had been in a group that prayed for 
health.
<P>The NIH study was released at a time when the federal government's 
premier medical research center is under pressure from religious conservatives 
offended by some of its studies of human sexuality. Nahin said that there had 
been no pressure from the Bush administration to add prayer to the list of 
survey questions.
<P>"The survey instrument was developed prior to when President Bush took 
office,'' he said.
<P>Dr. William Stewart, medical director for the Institute for Health and 
Healing at California Pacific Medical Center, said there was a growing body of 
scientific work suggesting that prayer does have a beneficial healing effect. 
"Most people who have a cancer diagnosis now engage in some sort of social 
support activity,'' he said. "If we look at prayer as a support network, it 
could contribute to the well-being and healing of an individual.''
<P>Stewart said he was concerned that surveys such as this one tended to 
lump all kinds of alternative medicine practices into one group, without much 
rationale for doing so. However, he said the larger picture painted by the 
study showed that "30 percent or more Americans say the spiritual aspects of 
treatment are important."
<P>"That,'' Stewart concluded, "is a very important and salient 
consideration for us physicians.''
