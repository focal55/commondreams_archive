<P>WASHINGTON  - The Bush administration has
overstated U.S.-funded job figures in Iraq  due to what the
government said was an accounting error, but critics say may be
a bid to paint a rosier picture on the ground.


<p>Increased employment in Iraq is seen as a measure of
progress as the country moves toward January elections.
 

<p>State Department figures released on Sept. 22 show the U.S.
government overstated by more than 30,000 the number of Iraqis
working on projects funded by the U.S. Agency for International
Development, one of Washington's biggest employers in Iraq.
 

<p>The Iraq Weekly Status report said 45,844 Iraqis were
employed in projects funded by USAID, according to Sept. 15
data, compared with 88,436 recorded in the previous week's
report, amounting to a 48.2 percent decrease. The 88,436 figure
was later adjusted to 55,463 jobs.
 

<p>"(This) decrease in (USAID) employment numbers reflects
correction of a previous accounting error," said a small-type
footnote at the bottom of the unclassified Sept. 22 document.
 

<p>Asked to explain the error, USAID spokesman Jose Fuentes
said he was looking into it.
 

<p><b>
 FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE
</b> 

<p>Democrats accuse the Bush administration of offering an
overly optimistic view of Iraq, with the party's presidential
candidate Sen. John Kerry accusing President Bush  of living in
a "fantasy world of spin."
 

<p>Reconstruction expert Rick Barton of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank,
said overstating such numbers was in line with the
administration's tendency to stress the positive and downplay
negative news.
 

<p>"The overstating probably fits with the tendency of meeting
the master's desire for happy news," Barton said.
 

<p>But Barton said the real story was not whether figures had
been inflated but why so few new jobs had been created in a
country where unemployment may be as high as 50 percent and is
seen as contributing to the insurgency.
 

<p>A little over &#36;1.2 billion has been spent out of the &#36;18.4
billion Congress rushed through last year to rebuild Iraq.
 

<p>The total number of Iraqis estimated to be working on
U.S.-funded projects was 74,770 in the latest State Department
weekly report released on Thursday, a decrease of 2.5 percent
over the previous week's total of 76,699. More than half of
these jobs are for USAID projects.
 

<p>One U.S. government official, who asked not be named, said
there had been some confusion over how to calculate the number
of jobs given to Iraqis and whether work that lasted for a day
or even a few hours should be included.
 

<p>"Basically, most people think we should count employment
that would generate income for a family and something which is
sustainable, rather than just a short-term job," the official
said.
 

<p>A spokeswoman for the Iraq Project and Contracting Office,
which handles U.S.-funded contracts, said there was an "ebb and
flow" in the number of jobs for Iraqis, depending on security
and the number of projects in any given week.
 

<p>The State Department hopes that by the end of 2005, U.S.
funding will create an additional 800,000 jobs in Iraq.
