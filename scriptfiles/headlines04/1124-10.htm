<p>ANNAPOLIS, Md. - An organization that put more than 400 poll watchers in Maryland precincts on election day reported Tuesday that its volunteers found scattered problems with the state's electronic voting machines.

	 

<p>Among the problems were machines that crashed, incorrect ballots and touch-screens that failed to work properly.

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.truevotemd.org/" target="_new">TrueVoteMD</a> had poll watchers in only about 6 percent of precincts, the 201 machine-related problems they reported "really represent a small part of what probably happened that day," said Linda Schade, a founder of the group.

<p>TrueVoteMD presented its report and a series of recommendations for improving the administration of elections to the State Board of Elections.

<p>Linda Lamone, state elections administrator, said the election was a success, but that there are problems with any voting system because "you've got people involved in running the election."

<p>The most frequent problem cited by TrueVoteMD was machines that crashed, and Jillian Aldebron, a TrueVote member, questioned whether votes that were cast before the machines crashed were counted. Lamone said the votes were stored on the memory card and were counted.

<p>Providing a voter-verifiable paper trail was at the top of a list of recommendations TrueVote delivered to the election board.
