<p>Last week, Daniel Ellsberg returned to the scene of what the U.S. 
          government once called a crime, to deliver an address at Santa Monica 
          College, just a mile from his former employer, the RAND Corporation.
<p>
          David Burak, the history instructor who brought Ellsberg to the 
          campus, introduced the lecturer, writer and activist as “a shape 
          shifter. He went from a man once highly commended by [Secretary of 
          State Henry] Kissinger to being called the most dangerous man in 
          America.”
<p>
          Ellsberg started with RAND in 1959 as a strategic analyst and 
          consultant to the Department of Defense and the White House. His 
          specialty was nuclear weapons, nuclear war plans, and crisis 
          decision-making. From 1964-67, he worked for the departments of 
          defense and state.
<p>
          “August 1, 1964 was my first day as a full-time employee at the 
          Pentagon,” he recalls. “A courier ran in with a cable from the 
          commander of a flotilla in the South China Sea, saying they were under 
          torpedo attack.”
<p>
          Throughout the morning, cables came in “every 10 minutes,” claiming as 
          many as 21 torpedoes had been fired. President Lyndon Johnson and 
          Defense Secretary Robert McNamara “were picking retaliation targets.”
<p>
          “At 1:30, a cable arrived saying ‘stop. All torpedo accounts except 
          the first are suspect.’ The sonar man was ‘mistaken.’ There weren’t 21 
          torpedoes. Actually, there were none.”
<p>
          But McNamara kept preparing to retaliate anyway. He knew what the rest 
          of the world didn’t: just the night before, the U.S. had covertly 
          attacked North Vietnam.
<p>
          On August 9th, Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, authorizing 
          the president to “take all necessary steps, including the use of armed 
          force” to counter “a deliberate and systematic campaign of 
          aggression.” 
<p>
          Ellsberg is still tormented by what he feels was his own failure to 
          act. “What should I have done with the information I had on August 4th 
          or 5th? Should I have gone to the press? That’s what I should have 
          done, what I wished I’d done. Instead, I went on learning my job. It’s 
          the worst thing I’ve ever done.”
<p>
          (During a pause in his speech, Ellsberg’s microphone spewed feedback, 
          prompting him to remark, “Silence has consequences.”)
<p>
          Returning to RAND in 1967, Ellsberg worked on a top-secret study 
          called “U.S. Decision-making in Vietnam, 1945-68.” In 1969, he 
          photocopied the 7,000-page document and gave it to the Senate Foreign 
          Relations Committee. Two years passed, and in 1971, Ellsberg turned 
          over to the press what would become known as the Pentagon Papers.
<p>
          “I did it,” he explains, “because I met young people who were doing 
          what they could. I asked myself, what can I do to end the war if I’m 
          willing to give up my career and go to jail?”
<p>
          The government charged Ellsberg with 12 felony counts that could have 
          meant 115 years in prison. “I was the only person since Nathan Hale to 
          be prosecuted for leaking information to the press.” 
<p>
          “Daniel Ellsberg put his life on the line just as much as we did,” 
          says Daniel Cano, SMC English professor and a former paratrooper with 
          the 101st Airborne Division. “He revealed the truth about the Vietnam 
          War that the Nixon administration didn’t want the public to know.”
<p>
          Ellsberg pointed out similarities in the Vietnam and Iraq wars, 
          calling the Tonkin Gulf Resolution “the model for the Iraq 
          Resolution.”
<p>
          “The Tonkin Gulf Resolution was based on lies. ‘It was an unprovoked 
          attack. We have unequivocal evidence. These are not beliefs, they are 
          facts.’ [Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld said ‘we know they have 
          missiles and we know where they are.’ He’s either psychotic or he’s 
          lying.”
<p>
          And for CIA chief George Tenet “to [present] a national intelligence 
          estimate that he knew was distorted was an inexcusable crime and 
          dereliction of duty. He used his ability and institution to lie the 
          public into a war.” (Tenet announced his resignation just hours before 
          Ellsberg’s appearance.)
<p>
          “War is very complicated,” observed Cano. “I’m glad we have men like 
          Daniel Ellsberg to sort it out for us.”
<p>
          “This war is going to be very hard to end,” Ellsberg cautions. “A 
          colleague who is still at RAND thinks it will go on for 20 years. We 
          got out of Vietnam in 10 years. There wasn’t any oil in Vietnam.”
<p>
          <b>Ellsberg On The Issues
          </b>
<p>
          Terrorism: “The U.S. took Special Forces out of Afghanistan where they 
          were pursuing Al Qaeda. Iraq has no connection to terrorism, but the 
          invasion is sure to create recruits for Bin Laden.”
<p>
          Ahmed Chalabi: “He may have been the greatest secret agent in Iran’s 
          history of spying.”
<p>
          Richard Clarke: “Clark recognized [the Bush administration’s] 
          determination to acquire Iraq as a territory for oil, although it 
          would certainly increase terrorism. I’m glad he didn’t wait until 
          after [President Bush and Vice President Cheney] were re-elected to 
          tell us.”
<p>
          Prisoner photos: “The photos created no sensation in Iraq. The people 
          there already knew what was going on.” If not for Joseph Darby, the 
          young soldier who exposed the abuse at Abu Ghraib, “The investigation 
          would still be classified top secret.”
<p>
          Prisoner abuse: “If you think that your brothers, sisters, your 
          fathers and sons could have not have ‘softened up’ prisoners at Abu 
          Ghraib, you are mistaken. The order to set aside the Geneva Convention 
          came from the top and was approved by the president. It’s a 
          long-standing policy that was used in Nicaragua and elsewhere, by our 
          proxies.”
<p>
          Congress: “People put too much pressure on the president and not 
          enough on congress. Almost nobody brought to the press’s attention how 
          badly they were doing. Thousands have died because of patriarchal, 
          militaristic attitudes that we are trained to think is part of being a 
          man,” including Democrats who “are afraid of being called cowards, 
          unmanly, or weak on terror.”
<p>
          The “outing” of CIA agent Valerie Plame: “Plame was tracking the 
          proliferation of nuclear materials around the world. [Vice President 
          Dick] Cheney was probably involved in the leak. We could lose a 
          president over this.” (This last comment was met with a spirited round 
          of applause.)
<p>
          New Patriot Act: “It will make Patriot Act I look like the Bill of 
          Rights.” Ellsberg also predicts a more authoritarian Secrets Act will 
          crop up “after the next terror attack, to go after reporter sources.”
<p>
          Military draft: “We have involuntary service now, through the extended 
          tours, and troops are understandably enraged. We shouldn’t be putting 
          more troops into Iraq. It gives the Defense Department too many men 
          and women to play with.”
<p>
          Draft backlash: “A draft will create an anti-war movement. We’ll have 
          to do better than we did last time.”
<p>
          The Bush administration: “Bush and his entire cabinet are indictable 
          at The Hague. I’d like to see Congress say ‘these crimes must be 
          investigated.’ They deserve impeachment. I’d do anything nonviolent 
          and truthful to get this gang out of power. It will take a lot of 
          people taking risks and showing courage.”
