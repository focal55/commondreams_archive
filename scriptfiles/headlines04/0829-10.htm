<p>NEW YORK  - Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators  toting colorful banners and shouting "no more Bush" took to  Manhattan's streets on Sunday, the day before the Republican  convention opens, to decry the Iraq war and President Bush's  policies.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->Organizers estimated 400,000 people turned out for the  march, which led to more than 100 arrests and yielded at least  one skirmish between self-styled anarchists and police. More  than 400 people have been arrested in protests since Thursday.<p> 
			
			Chanting "Hey Ho, Bush Has Got to Go," the largely peaceful  crowd marched past the Madison Square Garden convention site as  Republicans and visitors arrived in the city for a four-day  event where Bush will be nominated for another four-year term.<p> 
			
			Police declined to estimate the size of the crowd but it  stretched out more than a mile down one of the city's main  thoroughfares. Thousands of police -- many clad in riot gear,  some on bicycles and others on horseback -- turned out to  control the crowd, who carried signs saying "Osama Loves Bush,"  "Bush Lies Who Dies?" and "Hate is not a Family Value."<p> 
			
			A small group of masked anarchists set fire to a float just  one block from the convention site and hurled bottles at police  in riot gear who rushed them and made 11 arrests, police said.<p> 
			
			March organizer Leslie Cagan told Reuters that despite some  minor clashes, "The march has gone very, very well."<p> 
			
			"People have come to protest the Bush administration on  very many issues, but today we were united in speaking out  against the Bush agenda," she said.<p> 
			
			CARNIVAL ATMOSPHERE<p> 
			
			The march had a carnival atmosphere, with people carrying  large banners, shouting "no more Bush" and beating drums as  police helicopters overhead kept watch. The heat and humidity  pushed the temperature to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius).<p> 
			
			Many held banners opposing the war in Iraq. The Bush  administration said it invaded Iraq to rid Saddam Hussein of  weapons of mass destruction that threatened America's security,  but no stockpiles of weapons have been found.<p> 
			
			"He (Bush) is ruining the country that I knew as a child  growing up," said Joan Azulay, a retiree from Austin, Texas,  who complained of the president's policies on health care, the  environment, taxes and foreign affairs.<p> 
			
			One group carried 1,000 coffins as a tribute to American  soldiers dead in Iraq and to highlight what they see as the  true cost of the war there.<p> 
			
			The circular route took marchers through central Manhattan  and hundreds of activists defied a ban on rallying in Central  Park, the city's largest open space. Protesters were denied a  permit to gather in Central Park following the march on the  grounds city officials feared damage to the grass. Organizers  instead urged people to make their way to the park for a  "people's picnic."<p>

<!--/endimage/-->Hundreds of people lay on the grass in the park and formed  a massive human peace sign.<p> 
			
			"I just burning with anger about what our country is  doing," said Cornelius Boss, an ex-Marine from Columbus, Ohio,  about Bush's foreign policy.<p> 
			
			Organizers and a series of prominent speakers, including  civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, film maker Michael Moore  and some New York elected officials, boosted the protesters  with speeches before the start of the event.<p> 
			
			Security around the arena has been called the tightest in  the history of U.S. political events, with thousands of police  officers and Secret Service agents on guard.<p> 
			
			Streets were closed and concrete barriers put in place to  deter truck bombs amid warnings from Washington that al Qaeda  -- the group responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- or  others might attack America before the November election.<p> 
			
			Sunday's march took place as an estimated 50,000 visitors  were arriving in New York for the four-day convention to  nominate Bush for a second White House term. He will face  Democratic candidate Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts in the  election.<p>
