BAGHDAD  - Roadside bombs killed seven US soldiers in Iraq, one just newly arrived, and wounded several other people over the weekend as attackers use sneakier methods to conceal their weapons, officials said. 
<p> 
A bomb exploded late Saturday killing three troops from the 1st Armored Division as they patrolled an area in southeast Baghdad, a senior military official said.
 
<p>
 "One of our reconnaissance patrols stuck an improvised explosive device (IED), the blast caused the vehicle to roll into a canal," the military official told reporters.

A fourth soldier who was wounded died at a combat hospital Sunday, the Pentagon  said.
 
<p>
 Hours later, west of the city, a newly arrived US National Guard soldier was killed when the convoy he was traveling in was hit by a separate bomb attack at about 6:30 am (0300 GMT) Sunday.
 
<p>
 "It was sadly yet another roadside bomb," the senior official said.
 
<p>
 The soldier, who was due to work with the 1st Infantry Division, died of his wounds while being taken to hospital, the official added.
 
<p>
 It has been a bad weekend for the US army's 1st Infantry Division, which is replacing the 4th Infantry Division as part of the biggest troop rotation since World War II.
 
<p>
 On Saturday morning, two US soldiers were killed and three wounded in an attack on an army convoy in the center of the northern city of Tikrit -- the hometown of ousted president Saddam Hussein.
 
<p>
 Homemade and roadside bombs have become the biggest killers of US military personnel in Iraq.
 
<p>
 
But it is not just the army that is affected.
 
<p>
 
Two Iraqi civilians were wounded when a bomb exploded Sunday along a road between Khales, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Baquba and the northern city of Kirkuk, which is often used by military vehicles, an emergency services official said.
 
<p>
 "The bomb exploded on the road between Khales and Kirkuk a few moments after a US convoy passed by," said the rescue official, Karim Jassem.
 
<p>
 The two victims, one who had been driving a car and the other who had been walking, were taken to a hospital in Baquba, 40 kilometers (26 miles) north of Baghdad, Jassem told AFP.
 
<p>
 The senior military official said a total of seven IEDs were detonated Saturday night, while six were found and cleared before they exploded.
 
<p>
 He explained that roadside bombs are often hidden in the carcass of a dead animal to avoid raising the suspicion of people driving past and that most of the devices are detonated from a distance.
 
<p>
 One typical bomb disguise is a dog carcass with wires protruding from it.
 
<p>
 "It is sad but that is one of the techniques that are used here. Think like a robber is what we always say," the same official said Saturday.
<p>
Added to an official Pentagon tally, the latest deaths raise to 275 the number of US soldiers killed in action since US President George W. Bush declared major hostilities over on May 1.
<p>

Since March 10, nine US soldiers have been killed in IED attacks, a US military official confirmed.
<p>

Another US soldier was in critical but stable condition on Sunday after being stabbed several times by an unknown attacker in the US-led coalition's headquarters in Baghdad just after midnight, a US military official said.
<p>
It was unclear whether the attacker was a fellow soldier or someone else and an investigation was under way.
<p>
And the body of an Iraqi policeman from Fallujah, west of Baghdad, who disappeared two days ago, was discovered riddled with bullet holes, a police officer said.
