<p>MONTERREY, Mexico  - Latin American leaders told  President Bush on Tuesday that "perverse" economic policies  imposed by Washington had failed their countries, mired in debt  and poverty.
<p> 
			
							Bush tried at an Americas-wide summit to win back the  support of regional leaders after neglecting them over the last  two years to focus on Iraq and security.<p> 
			
							He instead heard stinging criticism that rampant free  market policies had done nothing to ease poverty and had forced  countries like Argentina into deep crisis.<p> 
			
							Brazil's leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said  the "Washington consensus" recipe of unfettered capitalism in  Latin America in the last decade had not delivered growth and  kept millions of people hungry in shanty towns and far-flung  villages.<p> 
			
							"After the 1980s -- the so-called lost decade -- the 90s  was a decade of despair," he said, calling for new policies to  tackle poverty directly.<p>

<!--/endimage/-->"It was a perverse model that wrongly separated the  economic from the social, put stability against growth and  separated responsibility and justice," Lula said. "Economic  stability turned its back on social justice."<p> 
			
							A string of other leaders also said the region needed to  change policies to give capitalism a more human face.<p> 
			
							Bush is urging leaders at the 34-nation Summit of the  Americas in the Mexican city of Monterrey to embrace market  reforms and greater democracy and to make quick progress on a  contentious Americas-wide free trade deal.<p> 
			
							"Over the long-term, trade is the most certain path to  lasting prosperity," he said, and called on his fellow leaders  to "show the world that free societies and free markets can  deliver real benefits to our citizens."<p> 
			
							But several major Latin American countries have moved to  the political left in the last few years and U.S.-backed  policies are no longer an easy sell in the region.<p> 
			
							Brazil and Argentina, which back free trade, are fiercely  critical of U.S. trade policy, saying Washington's own massive  agricultural subsidies effectively block access to the  lucrative U.S. market for more efficient producers.<p> 
			
							The Iraq war was widely unpopular in Latin America and more  and more leaders are skeptical of the free-market economic  reforms that were in vogue in the 1990s.<p> 
			
							"The great destabilizer in the region is poverty and  neo-liberalism," Venezuela's firebrand President Hugo Chavez  said in a speech here. "Let's recognize we are on a very bad  path," he told the summit leaders.<p> 
			
							UNJUST CONTINENT<p> 
			
							Even Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, a moderate leftist  who leads one of the most open and successful economies in  Latin America, pointed to weaknesses in the free-market  economic model and the massive divide between rich and poor  across the region.<p> 
			
							"This isn't the poorest continent, but it might be one of  the most unjust," he said.<p> 
			
							Latin American nations defeated a U.S. proposal that the  most corrupt governments in the Americas be barred from  regional meetings. They said it was too vague about who would  judge the record of others and some feared Washington would use  it to isolate its rivals.<p> 
			
							Bush attacked Cuban President Fidel Castro in a speech late  on Monday, calling on his fellow leaders to back calls for  democracy on the island.<p> 
			
							"Dictatorship has no place in the Americas. We must all  work for a rapid, peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba," he  said.<p> 
			
							In recent years, leftist leaders have been elected in  Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. All three have established  friendly ties with Castro, who has held power for 45 years  despite U.S. efforts to oust and isolate him.<p> 
			
							Castro is the only leader excluded from these summits but,  apart from Bush, there was little criticism of him here.<p> 
			
							Facing mounting problems in Latin America, Bush was anxious  to play up his much improved relationship with Mexican  President Vicente Fox.<p> 
			
							The two men fell out last year when Mexico opposed the Iraq  war but they were all smiles after meeting in private on Monday  and aides said the past problems were now behind them.<p> 
			
							Bush last week proposed a reform of immigration policy that  could benefit millions of mainly Mexican illegal workers.  Mexico in turn pleased Washington by tightening security at its  airports for U.S.-bound commercial flights.
