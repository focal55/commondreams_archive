<p>The head of the United States army has said that the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have provided a "tremendous focus" for the military. 

<p>General Peter Schoomaker said in an interview with AP news agency that the wars had allowed the army to instil its soldiers with a "warrior ethos".

<!--/endimage/-->But the general, who became chief of staff in August, denied warmongering saying the army must be ready to fight. 

<p>He also said he doubted recruiting more troops was a solution to army stress. 

<p>"You aren't stronger because you have more people," he said, adding that expanding the army was similar to pouring water on sand. 

<p>Many senior military figures have expressed concern about "overstretch", a problem which has become particularly acute in post-war situations like Iraq which require more troops than combat. 
<p>But General Schoomaker says the answer could be to expand combat strength by freeing troops from other assignments. 

<p><b>'Silver lining' </b>
<p>General Schoomaker said the attacks on America in September 2001 and subsequent events had given the US army a rare opportunity to change. 

<p>"There is a huge silver lining in this cloud," he said. 

<p>"War is a tremendous focus... Now we have this focusing opportunity, and we have the fact that [terrorists] have actually attacked our homeland, which gives it some oomph." 

<p>He said it was no use having an army that did nothing but train. 

<p>"There's got to be a certain appetite for what the hell we exist for," he said. 

<p>"I'm not warmongering, the fact is we're going to be called and really asked to do this stuff."
