<p>LAS VEGAS - Singer Linda Ronstadt not only got booed, she got the boot after lauding filmmaker Michael Moore and his new movie, Fahrenheit 9/11 during a performance at the Aladdin hotel-casino.

<p>Before singing "Desperado" for an encore Saturday night, the 58-year-old rocker called Moore a "great American patriot" and "someone who is spreading the truth." She also encouraged everybody to see the documentary about President Bush.

<p>Ronstadt's comments drew loud boos and some of the 4,500 people in attendance stormed out of the theater. People also tore down concert posters and tossed cocktails into the air.

<p>"It was a very ugly scene," Aladdin President Bill Timmins told The Associated Press. "She praised him and all of a sudden all bedlam broke loose."

<p>Timmins, who is British and was watching the show, decided Ronstadt had to go - for good. Timmins said he didn't allow Ronstadt back in her luxury suite and she was escorted off the property.

<p>Ronstadt's antics "spoiled a wonderful evening for our guests and we had to do something about it," Timmins said.

<p>Timmins said it was the first time he sent a performer packing.

<p>"As long as I'm here, she's not going to play," Timmins said.

<p>Ronstadt had been booked to play the Aladdin for only one show.

<p>Calls to Ronstadt's manager were not immediately returned.

<p>In an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal before the show, Ronstadt said "I keep hoping that if I'm annoying enough to them, they won't hire me back."

<p>Looks like she got her wish.
