<P>MIAMI - Little Havana, the Cuban corner of Miami, is the last place in Florida where George Bush would expect to find himself in trouble. In the offices of the Cuban American National Foundation, a bleak poster of Fidel Castro's political prisoners welcomes visitors. </p>
<p>But when the veteran anti-Castro rebel Pepe Hernandez, who once risked his life at Cuba's Bay of Pigs in a CIA-backed coup attempt, starts adding up the votes of Cuban Americans in Florida, his conclusion is unexpected. </p>
<p>&quot;If [the Democratic Party candidate] John Kerry can just get 30 per cent of the Cuban vote, then he would most likely win Florida,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>&quot;The community has been changing substantially, especially over the last 10 years. Los Historicos [older people who arrived when Dr Castro defeated the rebellion] ... they are living in history, out of the passions, experiences and tragedies of 20 and 30 and 40 years ago.&quot; </p>
<p>Los Historicos still form a substantial element of Miami's Cuban population and they turn out to vote in large numbers. &quot;They are older and very much Republican,&quot; Mr Hernandez says.</p>
<p>But the new immigrants, many of whom left Cuba for economic reasons, along with the children of the exiles, are changing the voting patterns of the population of nearly 1 million, which includes more than 450,000 registered voters. &quot;Cuba is still an issue, but it is less important to them,&quot; Mr Hernandez believes. &quot;Their sympathies are more with the Democrats than the Republicans.&quot;</p>
<p>Just this month, Mr Hernandez and his foundation lost their executive director, 39-year-old Joe Garcia, when he went to work for the New Democrat Network.</p>
<p>In the 1984 election, the Republican Ronald Reagan won the Cuban vote by 94 per cent. But in 1996, the Democrat Bill Clinton, appealing to the newer immigrants and their economic interests, managed to claw away 39 per cent.</p>
<p>In 2000 the emotionally charged case of Elian Gonzales, the Cuban boy who made it to Florida after almost drowning and who was caught between his relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba, stalled that trend. Mr Clinton had insisted the boy return to Cuba with his father.</p>
<p>The controversy sank the hopes of Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, with the Cubans, and Mr Bush wrapped up 82 per cent of their vote. Mr Gore lost Florida by 537 votes. If he had increased his Cuban vote by only 1 per cent he would have won.</p>
<p>Mr Bush and his chief political strategist, Karl Rove, are acutely aware of these numbers. While Florida has more than 6 million registered voters, few of them are swinging votes. Keeping the Cuban base is crucial for Mr Bush.</p>
<p>So, says Mr Hernandez, Mr Rove came up with an idea to energise Los Historicos. Recently, the White House brought down new measures against Cuba. The most controversial allowed Cubans to visit their families back home only once every three years instead of once a year, thus cutting the flow of US dollars.</p>
<p>But the move has been deeply unpopular with newer Cuban Americans and led to ugly splits, even among Los Historicos. &quot;In my opinion they made a mistake,&quot; Mr Hernandez says. &quot;Because, largely, the Cuban people continue to place the family in front of everything else. That is going to have some effect on the way Cubans vote in November.&quot;</p>
<p>The Democratic challenger is heavily dependent on winning the first debate against Mr Bush at the University of Miami this week to boost his troubled campaign. But down in Little Havana, Mr Hernandez sees as much trouble ahead for Mr Bush as his rival in this battleground state.</p>
