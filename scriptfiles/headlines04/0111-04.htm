<p> DOVER, Del. - Nearly a month after Saddam
Hussein's capture, American war dead from Iraq continue to
arrive with somber regularity at the wind-swept Air Force base
in Delaware that is home to the world's largest mortuary.
<p>
 The remains of the fallen, wrapped in body bags and encased
in ice-laden metal transfer cases, descend from the sky aboard
gray military planes or white civilian Boeing 747s. They are
met at the airstrip by an honor guard, chaplain and small
motorcade of blue vans.
 <p>
 The chaplain prays while the honor guard drapes a flag over
each coffin and escorts it to the vans, which ferry the dead on
a two-mile trek to the 70,000-square-foot Dover Air Force Base
Port Mortuary.
 <p>
 There, at the U.S. military's only stateside mortuary, the
remains are identified, autopsied, embalmed, clothed in dress
uniforms, placed in coffins and shipped to grieving relatives
in the company of military escorts.
 <p>
 The bodies of nine soldiers who died aboard an Army Black
Hawk helicopter that crashed near Falluja on Thursday were
expected to arrive this weekend.
 
<p>
 "That will put us over 500 for Iraq," said Karen Giles, an
Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel who heads a permanent
eight-member staff supplemented by FBI fingerprint experts,
pathologists and other specialists.
 <p>
 "We'll probably have 50 or 60 people working here over the
weekend," Giles said.
 <p>
 500 DEAD
 
<p>
 According to Pentagon statistics released on Friday, 494
military personnel have died in Iraq. The mortuary also handles
U.S. civilian dead, including contractors.
 <p>
 Mortuary services began at Dover in 1955. But their current
home, a facility built with &#36;30 million allocated after the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, opened in October with an enhanced
capacity to house hundreds of bodies.
 <p>
 The mortuary has been empty only twice since U.S. forces
invaded Iraq in March. "The last time was in October," Giles
told Reuters during a tour of the facility.
 <p>
 Saddam Hussein's capture on Dec. 13 raised hopes that
attacks on U.S. forces would ebb as American authorities
pursued new intelligence leads and stepped up counterinsurgency
tactics.
 <p>
 But the pace of casualties has not changed despite apparent
U.S. success at reducing daily attacks, policy experts say.
 <p>
 Thirty Americans have died in hostile action during the 27
days between Saddam's capture and Friday, according to a
Pentagon official. In comparison, 41 died in hostilities the
month before Saddam's capture, from Nov. 13 through Dec. 13.
 <p>
 "Since the mid-summer time period, we've seen a fairly
steady pace of around 30 to 40 Americans killed per month, and
I don't anticipate that number changing quickly," said Michael
O'Hanlon, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think
tank.
 <p>
 MORE THAN FIRST THREE YEARS OF VIETNAM
 <p>
 In November, U.S. casualties in Iraq surpassed the number
of Americans killed in the first three years of the Vietnam
War, according to a Reuters analysis of Pentagon statistics.
<p>
 For a time, growing casualties threatened President Bush's
public approval ratings as he prepared for re-election amid
fears that Iraq could turn into a quagmire for American forces.
<p>
But Bush's ratings surged after Saddam's capture and have
stayed aloft.
<p>
Heritage Foundation senior policy analyst James Carafano
said casualties appear to have become less of an issue for the
public and the media since Saddam's capture.
<p>
"The American people will accept casualties as long as they
see progress toward the setting up of a legitimate government
in Iraq," Carafano said.
<p>
"Look at the headlines. Casualties were on page one every
day. Now they're drifting back to page four or page five."
<p>
Back at Dover Air Force Base, the media are not allowed to
see silver caskets arrive on the tarmac because of a Pentagon
blackout first implemented in 1991 under Bush's father, former
President George Bush. It was reissued in March.
<p>
Pentagon officials say the policy is meant to protect the
wishes and privacy of the soldiers' families.
<p>
But policy experts say military officials are also driven
by fear that news images of American casualties -- at Dover or
in Iraq -- will erode public support for U.S. policy.
<p>
"The general assumption is that if people see the casualty
visually, they will not any longer support the war," said
retired Air Force Col. Sam Gardiner, a vocal critic of the Bush
administration.
<p>
"The fear of images is a left-over Vietnam thing. However,
the notion of controlling them is a modern thing."
