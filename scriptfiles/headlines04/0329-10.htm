<P>When famous whistle-blower Daniel Ellsberg boarded a plane to 
Cincinnati earlier this week, he took along a little light reading: a stack of 
articles about former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke, who has stirred 
controversy with allegations in his book and testimony before a special panel 
that the Bush White House was somewhat indifferent to al Qaeda before Sept. 11 
and obsessed with Iraq afterward.
<P>Ellsberg, who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers documenting government 
misrepresentations about the Vietnam War, sees Clarke as part of a trend: well-
placed individuals in the government who have gone public with books or 
interviews outlining their concerns and criticisms about their country's 
government  --  while that government is still in power.
<P>Ellsberg is not alone in that observation  --  observers from across the 
political spectrum, whether they support Clarke's actions or not, agree that a 
new willingness exists to tell all far sooner, and far more publicly, than in 
the past. 
<P>Ellsberg cites officials such as Scott Ritter, the former lead inspector 
for the U.N. Special Commission on Concealment and Investigations team, and 
Katharine Gun, a British government linguist who leaked an e-mail purportedly 
from U.S. intelligence services asking for help spying on U.N. ambassadors. 
<P>Opinions differ on whether the willingness to tell all is a good thing, 
but to Ellsberg, who has been sharply critical of the war in Iraq and even 
written articles encouraging current government employees to leak what he 
calls "Iraq's Pentagon Papers," the phenomenon is a source of optimism.
<P>"I think these people are heroes. They're really acting appropriately in 
a very dangerous situation," he said. "It's as if we are learning about the 
Tonkin Gulf a month or two later instead of years later."
<P>Although Ellsberg, now 72 and living in Kensington, considers Clarke 
somewhat of a kindred spirit, he doesn't quite see him as a whistle-blower. 
Clarke was no longer an employee of the administration when he spoke out and 
did not provide documentation to back up his accusations  --  accusations the 
administration has rejected. 
<P>Ellsberg said the only real whistle-blower of recent times is Gun, who 
briefly faced charges under the British Official Secrets Act and supported her 
claims with documents.
<P>"I find her really admirable," Ellsberg said, but he considers the rest 
remarkable, too, for being willing to go public in a way and with a speed that 
simply didn't occur 40 years ago.
<P>"Why are they acting differently from people in my generation?" he said. 
"We knew (Vietnam) was just as deceptive and the policy was just as bad, but 
we certainly weren't tempted to leak."
<P>At least, not until Ellsberg did it. But since then, a number of 
observers said, going public early and often has become more and more 
acceptable, even among ranking government officials.
<P>It certainly wasn't acceptable in the 1950s, said Stephen Hess, who was a 
speechwriter for President Dwight Eisenhower and is now with the Brookings 
Institution in Washington, D.C.
<P>"It was a rule of thumb that no one spoke until the president did. When 
the president wrote his memoir, told his story, that was when the others did," 
Hess said. The exceptions, he said, were books that were rarely very critical  
--  and even then, they were considered scandalous.
<P>"We on the staff thought that was just in such poor form ... it just 
wasn't done," he said.
<P>The ideal at the time, Hess said, was the White House staff described by 
pre-World War II political scientist Louis Brownlow, who recommended that 
President Franklin Roosevelt's staff should "remain in the background, issue 
no orders, make no decisions, emit no public statements ... They should be 
possessed of high competence, great physical vigor, and a passion for 
anonymity."
<P>That changed markedly with the release of the Pentagon Papers. Another 
step came, Hess said, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, who 
was criticized in public by some former staffers and was himself critical of 
his predecessors and later his successors  --  another taboo. After that, the 
genie was out of the bottle.
<P>"Over time, it became an avalanche. By the time you reached Clinton, you 
had people that secretly had book contracts," he said. "You had people sitting 
around the table keeping notes."
<P>Both former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris and former senior 
adviser George Stephanopoulos had books published while Clinton was still in 
office.
<P>But Clarke's book, because of his position, may be taking the trend to a 
new level, said Peter Berkowitz, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution 
and an associate professor of law at George Mason University Law School.
<P>"I do think what Clarke has done is really unprecedented in our history: 
somebody who served as a national security adviser to the president stepping 
down and, while that president is still in office, blasting him," he said. 
"That just hasn't been done before."
<P>It is also surprising, Berkowitz said, that comments by Clarke, O'Neill, 
and Hans Blix, the former U.N. chief weapons inspector in Iraq, have such an 
impact on public policy and public discourse  --  even though, in his opinion, 
they fit into the category of disgruntled ex-employee as comfortably as 
whistle-blower.
<P>"That's actually one reason, it seems to me, to take this criticism with 
a grain of salt," Berkowitz said.
<P>But regardless of the motivation, telling all is probably going to be 
increasingly popular, said UC Berkeley political science Professor Bruce Cain, 
for commercial reasons if not ideals. 
<P>It is increasingly difficult, because of conflict-of-interest laws, for 
former government officials to move easily back and forth between the 
government and the private sector, and the growth of cable and the publishing 
industry ensures that they can seek lucrative post-government employment in 
the media, Cain said. 
<P>And because books sell better when the author's name is fresh in people's 
minds, he said, it is likely such books will continue to be published as soon 
as possible  --  and sooner all the time.
<P>"It's part of this whole speeding up of the cycle of everything. Now, 
even our memories have to come faster," he said. 
<P>Michael Kohn, general counsel for the private National Whistleblower 
Center, agreed with Cain's prediction of faster and faster revelations, but 
with a different premise.
<P>"You're seeing an evolution of our society. Ellsberg is essentially the 
first modern whistle- blower. As a result, the news media observed how 
important obtaining this type of information was and how it was the ultimate 
lifeline to a free society," he said. "As this message began to take root, the 
will of people to expose information at an earlier point of time has just gone 

with it."
<P>The main brake on the phenomenon, Kohn said, are federal laws that he 
feels inadequately protect people who try to speak up while still employed, 
causing more to delay revelation until they quit or are fired. 
<P>With more protective laws, he said, "you would have heard from (Clarke) 
before Sept. 11."
<P>Hess and Berkowitz said the consequences of this new willingness to tell 
all include the loss of a kind of loyalty in government service that had been 
a tradition, and the possibility that future administrations may appoint more 
party loyalists and be less willing to keep on longtime civil servants from 
prior administrations.
<P>"There is a very good reason why there is executive privilege and why a 
president should feel they have a right to receive confidential information 
from their aides and that their aides owe" loyalty to them, Hess said. 
<P>But to Ellsberg, the fact that a number of Bush's own people have been 
willing to break that presumption of loyalty is a strong condemnation of the 
president and his neo-conservative allies, something Clarke himself has hinted 
at in public statements.
<P>Asked on "60 Minutes" whether he owed loyalty to the president, Clarke 
responded, "Up to a point. When the president starts doing things that risk 
American lives, then loyalty to him has to be put aside."

documents.

the Middle East who has criticized the handling of postwar Iraq.

office.
