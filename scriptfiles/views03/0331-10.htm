<p>"People say to me, 'You are not the Vietnamese. You have no jungles 

and swamps,' " Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is quoted as telling a 

University of Warwick researcher six months ago. "I reply, 'Let our cities be 

our swamps and our buildings our jungles.'‚''

<P>How did the sands of the Iraqi desert turn so suddenly into a quagmire? How 

did an Iraqi military that we pictured in fixed positions on Kuwaiti border or 

arrayed along "highways of death" (as in 1991) awaiting incineration by Apache 

helicopters and F-16s suddenly morph into an incipient guerrilla force?

<P>As the nascent Chinese Communist movement fought for their lives against 

Chiang Kai-shek in 1928, Mao Zedong wrote "The Struggle in the Qinggang 

Mountains." By doing so, he bequeathed to the modern world the mother-of-all 

handbooks on how weaker military forces can paralyze, if not defeat, far 

superior ones. Mao's answer to conventional pitched battles was a "mobile" and 

"protracted" form of warfare that won through harassment. And, although far 

weaker and less well-equipped, the Red Army did ultimately outlast both the 

invading Japanese army and the Nationalist government.

<P>The ingredients of this new kind of "asymmetrical warfare" were: 

decentralization, surprise, agility and deception. Above all, counseled Mao, 

weaker forces should avoid major engagements and settle instead with a victory 

of attrition by means of repeated, small-scale raids.

<P>Mao was inspired by the classical Chinese strategist Sun Zi, whose ancient 

classic, "The Art of War," first codified the basic tenets of guerrilla war 

more than two millennia ago.

<P>Counseling against direct confrontation, Mao reminded his followers that a 

weaker army should "strike only when positively certain that the enemy's 

situation, the terrain, and popular support are all in our favor and not in 

his."

<P>Mao's triumph in China helped proliferate an almost mythic legacy of 

"people's war," one that Americans confronted in an agonizing way in Indochina 

as we fought against a convert Maoist strategy, General Vo Nguyen Giap, who 

led the Vietnam People's Army (NVA) and the National Liberation Front (NLF).

<P>Such a strategy is precisely what Iraqi supporters of Saddam Hussein have 

begun to use. But what may prove to be even more disruptive of coalition plans 

are Iraqi intentions to engage in urban guerrilla warfare -- even suicide 

bombing -- as U.S. and U.K. troops finally enter their cities and start trying 

"to build a peace." An indiscriminate urban counterinsurgency effort could 

prove as compromising to America's image as the campaigns to "win the hearts 

and minds of the people" in rural Vietnam did decades ago. As Sun Zi warned: 

"The worst policy is to besiege cities."

<P>Body counts, B-52 strikes, wounded GIs in medi-vac choppers, downed 

helicopter gunships surrounded by AK-47 toting peasants, "Five O'clock Follies-

like" Centcom briefings, anti-war demonstrations, troop escalations, and a 

repetition of official expressions that the war is still "on track," all have 

a haunting ring.

<P>If over the last few days, U.S. military planners have come to view 

"irregular forces" like the Fedayeen Saddam and the Special Republican Guard 

commandos as "a major annoyance" -- the "equivalent of the black pajama Viet 

Cong," as one senior U.S. intelligence official put it -- we can only wonder 

what kind of an annoyance such insurgents will be to the process of "nation 

building."

<P>Few countries have ever welcomed foreign air strikes or invasion and 

history is replete with occasions when nationalism trumped a people's loathing 

of dictatorship. No greater example exists than Hitler's invasion of Russia. 

Despite Stalin's tyrannical rule, Russians fought heroically to repel the 

German advance.

<P>We know that Saddam Hussein is student of Stalin, but it now looks as if he 

and Tariq Aziz have been reading a little Mao on the side. And it is a 

stunning lapse that as it planned to topple him by military means, the Bush 

administration did not understand that Saddam would inevitably turn to 

guerrilla warfare fired by nationalism to save his Arab dignity, if not his 

country and himself. As the Washington Post has reported, intelligence-agency 

warnings of a possible guerrilla war in Iraq fell on deaf ears in the White 

House.

<P>Did Bush strategists view Aziz as such a propagandist that his words should 

be utterly discounted? It is difficult to believe, especially since short of 

instant occupation or abject surrender - options that few thought the Iraqi 

government would accept -- Saddam Hussein had no other realistic options other 

than to borrow a leaf from Chairman Mao and engage in urban guerrilla warfare.
