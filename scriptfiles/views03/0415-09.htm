<p>Nurses are digging graves in front of the Al Mansour

Hospital.  Baghdad University is a smoking ruin. 

Other disasters loom, as the Red Cross warns that

Baghdad's medical system is in complete collapse, and

the millions of Iraqis dependent on the old

Oil-for-Food program wait for rations that are no

longer being delivered .  "Water first, and then

freedom," said one Iraqi man on a BBC report this

morning.



<p>Two musicians, Majid Al-Ghazali and Hisham Sharaf,

came to our Hotel four days ago, hoping to call

relatives outside Iraq on a satellite phone.  Hisham's

home was badly damaged during the war.  "One month

ago, I was the director of the Baghdad Symphony

Orchestra," Hisham said with an ironic smile. "Now,

what am I?"  



<p>We joked that he could direct the telephone exchange

as he tinkered with our satellite phone's solar

powered battery.  I told Majid we had some sheet music

and a guitar for him.  "What are notes?" he said,  "We

don't even remember."

</table></font>Majid had a particularly rough experience.  During the

first week of bombing, a neighbor called the secret

police and turned him in for visiting with foreigners.

 He was jailed the next day.  After the "fall" of

Baghdad, the same neighbor claimed he was actually

part of the secret police.  Majid is terrified now. 

"I think they want my house," he said.  "No place is

safe."  He put his head in his hands.



<p>I met Hisham at the Baghdad School of Folk Music and

Ballet, in January 2002.  Hisham and Majid, both

graduates of the school, taught there in the daytime

and then rehearsed with the orchestra at night. 

Knowing how busy Hisham was, I felt presumptuous about suggesting a project for him and his students.  I told him how meaningful the song "O Finlandia" has been to many people in the US.  At least 150 families who lost loved ones on 9/11 had used this peace anthem as part of memorial services.  Sibelius composed the melody in the late 19th century. Following World War I, lyrics were created emphasizing the common aspirations and dreams shared by all humanity.  



<p>Hisham chuckled and couldn't resist pointing out the

irony that someone from the US wanted to teach his

students a peace song. "O.K.," said he, "Sing it for

me.  We can do this."  Within two days, an entire

class was singing an Arabic transliteration of the

song.    



<p>Saying goodbye to Majid and Hisham, that morning, I

felt a wave of sadness, wondering if the hopeful,

idealistic verses might embitter them now.   



<p>The next morning they returned, shaken and distraught.

 They had approached US soldiers the previous evening

asking for help to protect their school.  The soldiers

said it was not their job and ordered Hisham and Majid

to go away.  They went to the entrance of the school

hoping they could somehow protect it alone.  Five

armed men arrived.  Majid, Hisham and Hisham's brother

pled with them not to attack the school.  The looters

argued, "We are simple people. Poor people.  Soon

there will be no food, no money, and we have no jobs. 

You are rich people."  



<p>"Please," Majid said, "we will give you the

instruments, give you the furniture, but don't destroy

the music, the records, the history."  "No," the armed

men said. "Baghdad is finished."  They ransacked the

school, broke many instruments, burnt the music and

the records. 



<p>Why do desperate people commit deplorable acts of

mindless destruction?  I don't know.  But some truths

help offer perspective.  Every day, we who enjoy

superfluous, inordinate wealth and comforts, while

others live in abject poverty, are ransacking the

precious and irreplaceable resources of our planet. We

hurtle toward burning up all the available fossil

fuels that were created over 4 billion years of the

planet's history.  Our obscene obsession with creating

weapons has cost trillions of dollars that should have

been spent to meet human needs. 



<p>Through decades of warfare and sanctions, powerful

elites in Iraq, the US and the UK ignored millions of

Iraq's impoverished people.  Hundreds of thousands of

children bore excruciating punishment and then died. 

Very few people cared.



<p>"Here," Hisham said, "listen to this. This is all we

have left."  He handed me headphones borrowed from a

Norwegian television correspondent.  The orchestra was

playing "O Finlandia."  Listening to the children

craft their music, I softly sang the words:  "This is

my song, O God of all the nations.  A song of peace

for lands afar and mine.  This is my home, the country

where my heart is. Here are my dreams, my hopes, my

holy shrine. But other hearts in other lands are

beating, with hopes and dreams as deep and true as

mine." Then I stopped.  Hisham had begun to cry.
