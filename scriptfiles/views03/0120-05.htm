<p>If Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., were alive



today, he might well be leading acts of civil disobedience against the war in



Afghanistan and Iraq. And he would probably be charged with domestic terrorism,



under the new anti-terrorism act. Anyone who has any links to his organization,



or contributed money to it, could be charged too.</p>



<p>According to Section 803 of the act, it takes



three things to make you a domestic terrorist. You have to break a law (federal



or state). Your lawbreaking has to involve "acts dangerous to human life." And



it must "appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce" a civilian population



and / or the government.</p>



<p>Suppose Dr. King and a bunch of others sat down



in a highway in front of a truck carrying cluster bombs on their way to Iraq.



This one should be an easy shot for a prosecutor who wants to charge him with



terrorism. He definitely broke the law. "Acts dangerous to human life"? You



betcha, the prosecutor tells the jury.</p>



<p>The crowd could easily get out of hand, spill



into the oncoming lane, and cause a car to swerve dangerously. The truck



carrying the bombs might get tipped over. An ambulance with a mortally ill



person might not be able to get through. If one protestor forgot about the



little penknife in her pocket, the prosecutor's case would be made: armed with



deadly weapons.</p>



<p>And surely the protest appears to be an effort



to intimidate or coerce the government.</p>



<p>For the defense, I can hardly hope to find



words as eloquent as Dr. King's would have been. But I can guess the gist of it.



Yes, we broke the law, King would admit. And we are prepared to take the



punishment prescribed for blocking a public thoroughfare. But terrorism? No way.



We are a disciplined, well-trained group of protestors. We took great care to



make sure nothing that we did would harm anyone. If an ambulance came by, we'd



move immediately. Otherwise, the only danger was from the police, who might not



be as careful as we were. And that woman had no idea the little knife was in her



pocket; no intent there.</p>



<p>But even if you find us dangerous to human



life, you still have to prove that we were trying to intimidate or coerce the



government. I follow the teachings of the great Gandhi, says King. The essence



of nonviolence is that we never intend to intimidate or coerce anyone. We only



show people their choices. The driver of the bomb truck did not have to stop,



just because we were sitting in the road. We were prepared to suffer injury or



even to die, though never to kill, in the service of peace.</p>



<p>The driver simply had to make a choice: Will I



continue on in a path that is bound to bring injury to others, or will I turn



around? We intended only to dramatize the choice that the driver, and the



government that hired him, and the taxpayers who pay him, are making at every



moment: either go on killing or turn around which is the literal meaning of the



word "repentance."</p>



<p>You, Mr. Prosecutor, say that it appears that



we intended to coerce. Coercion is in the eye of the beholder. Do you think the



truck driver must give in to overwhelming force? Then you believe that physical



power always prevails, that the stronger force always wins the day. That is



precisely why you and people like you go off to war.</p>



<p>We refuse to make war because, we do not share



your belief that physical power always prevails. We do not practice violence



because we put our faith in a different kind of power -- not physical power over



others, but the power of the moral conscience. We know that everyone, at every



moment, is free to choose good or evil. No one can make that choice for anyone



else. No one can control anyone's choices, any more than we could control the



truck driver's choice. All we can do is follow our own conscience and then let



others follow theirs.</p>



<p>Hogwash, says the prosecutor. You sat in the



road to force the driver to stop, to prevent needed weapons from reaching our



troops, who are fighting to defend our freedom on foreign shores. That certainly



appears to have been your intention. And it is intimidation and coercion.</p>



<p>Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, having heard



the evidence, what say you? Is the defendant, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,



guilty or not guilty of the crime of domestic terrorism?</p>
