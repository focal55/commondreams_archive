<p> As if the Iraq war mysteriously imparted new value to the proposed 
national missile defense system, Congress is poised to approve the Bush 
administration's multibillion-dollar budget request for the program -- without 
any real opposition or debate.
<P>Democrats, who have raised moderate objections to the missile program in 
the past, are running scared. They appear ready to fight President Bush over 
some domestic priorities, such as education and health care, but there's no 
sign that they will scrutinize any defense request -- even the most expensive 
ones such as missile defense.
<P>But if the Democrats focus only on domestic issues, they will miss an 
opportunity to promote a much more important and appealing agenda with 
Americans. In fact, Democrats can now use missile defense to their advantage, 
scoring political points on an issue that Republicans once thought was safely 
in their control.
<P>For a couple years prior to Sept. 11, in an approach masterminded by then-
President Clinton, Democrats supported deployment of a "limited" national 
missile defense system. They did this for political -- not military -- reasons:
<P>Democrats hoped to take another issue away from the Republicans. We support 
missile defense, too, they wanted to tell voters -- just like the Republicans.
<P>This strategy failed, because Republicans then proposed a bigger system, 
leaving Democrats where they started: on the defensive.
<P>After Sept. 11 -- which was irrefutable evidence of the limited benefit of 
a missile defense system -- Democrats threw in the towel completely and voiced 
little or no opposition to the missile defense program.
<P>It's time for the Democrats to stop chasing the Republicans and go on the 
offensive. They should take a unified position against deployment of missile 
defense, arguing that it might be a good idea someday, but not now. They 
should oppose the Manhattan Project-scale missile defense program that the 
Pentagon has undertaken.
<P>Judging from debates of yore, Republicans would accuse Democrats of being 
weak on defense. Rather than respond with a weak alternative or no alternative,
<P>Democrats should then move into attack mode, arguing that it makes no sense 
to rush to deploy an expensive defense system, particularly in light of our 
nation's newly evident national security needs such as airport security, 
education or health care at home -- and, yes, more foreign aid and other forms 
of assistance abroad.
<P>The Democrats could cite national missile defense as a source of funding 
for our country's new national security requirements. Yes, they could argue, 
missile defense sounds like a good idea, especially with nations including 
North Korea acquiring nuclear weapons, and America should maintain a modest 
research effort.
<P>But what about renovating and rebuilding our nation's crumbling schools -- 
to shore up our long-term economic security? For a fraction of the cost of 
missile defense, we could repair all of America's public schools. And what 
about international poverty, which we know breeds terrorism? The president 
proposes to spend an embarrassingly low $10 billion on humanitarian foreign 
aid next year, while the Pentagon would get $399 billion. And how about a 
Manhattan Project-style program to achieve energy independence, reducing our 
reliance on oil?
<P>Today, Americans know that "national security" depends on much more than a 
fat Pentagon budget. Democrats should connect with this new awareness, 
sympathizing with citizens who like the concept of missile defense, but 
arguing that it's simply not a national security priority. And they could 
emphasize to voters that our nation is in no position to waste money when so 
many of our vital needs at home and abroad need funds.
