<p>A <A HREF="http://www.military.com/NewsContent?file=FL_war_082003" target="_new">lawsuit</a> on behalf of over 100,000 Gulf War veterans
has the Bush administration on edge and businesses running for cover.

<p>The class action suit names 11 companies and 33 banks
alleged to have helped Iraq with its chemical weapons
program in the 1980's, despite knowledge Saddam Hussein
was actively using WMD against both Iranians and his
own people.

<p>At the time, Reagan's Middle East envoy was one Donald Rumsfeld, hard at work opening doors for Hussein's regime to purchase millions in aircraft, hardware and other potential weaponry.

<p>But after the invasion of Kuwait bumped Hussein from
Pentagon friend to the "Most Wanted" list, coalition
forces got stuck with the nasty task of dealing with
the same chemical weapons that businesses had profited
by helping Iraq amass. 

<p>Unfortunately, most Gulf War troops didn't realize that
in destroying Hussein's WMD, they would also be
endangering their own lives. 

<p>In the 1991 air war against Iraq, coalition forces
bombed weapons production facilities and ammunition

dumps, subjecting themselves to widespread and
unexpected fallout; in one disastrous case, over
100,000 service members were exposed to sarin nerve gas
when the US military improperly blew up chemical
weapons sites in Khamisiyah.

<p>Today, it is estimated that up to half of the 697,000
<A HREF="http://www.gulfwarvets.com/news13.htm" target="_new">Gulf War veterans are sick,</A>
many suffering from a variety of symptoms collectively
known as Gulf War Illness. The US Department of Defense
(DOD) has been repeatedly criticized for mishandling
the veterans' health complaints, often citing lack of
diagnosis as justification for withholding treatment
and compensation.

<p>However, <A HREF=" http://www.gulfwarvetlawsuit.com/page7.html" target="_new">recent medical research </A>has established causal
links 
between exposure to chemical warfare agents, Gulf War
Illness and birth defects among veterans' children. 

<p>It's those links attorneys Gary Pitts and Kenneth
McCallion will address. Maintaining "companies and
banks have not yet had any negative consequences for
helping Saddam Hussein build his chemical weapons of
mass destruction," Pitts and McCallion claim the
lawsuit is not only "to seek just compensation for the
poisoned veterans and their birth-defected children, it
is to deter companies from engaging in this kind of
behavior in the future."

<p>And in light of today's conflict in Iraq, the lawsuit's implications are both broad-reaching and ominous. At least 100 Gulf War II troops have already contracted a <A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,1282,-2993917,00.html" target="_new">"mystery" pneumonia-like illness </A >the US Department of Defense
can't properly diagnose, and the families of soldiers
based in Iraq are demanding answers. 

Michael Neusche describes how his 20-year-old son Josh,
a former track star from Missouri, wrote home from
active duty in Iraq on June 26 saying would be doing a secretive "hauling" mission. By July 1 Josh had fallen into a coma; the military promptly reclassified Josh as <A HREF="http://www.gulfwarvets.com/news13.htm" target="_new">"medically retired," </A>
thus stripping him and his family of entitlements, and
on July 12th Josh died from what the Pentagon called
"other causes." 

<p>In a similar case, Zeferino E. Colungo, a 20-year-old
from Texas, died after battling an unexplained
pneumonia-like illness. In a <A HREF="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030813-041249-8246r">recent letter </A
> to Secretary
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the Colungo family says,
"We deserve to know 
why a healthy young man who was
supposedly screened and determined fit for deployment
would suddenly die. It is our right to receive honest
answers."

<p>It's clear the DOD has some explaining to do; GW II
troops must not be forced to receive the same medical run-around suffered by their predecessors.

<p>The lawsuit on behalf of Gulf War veterans, however,
ups the ante considerably - this time not only the DOD
is under fire. By targeting companies and banks for compensation, veterans are sending the weapons industry a clear warning: it's getting dangerous to profit by helping dubious governments produce WMD.
