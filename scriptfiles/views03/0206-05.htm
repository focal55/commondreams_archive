<p>During his audio-visual presentation to the United Nations Security Council yesterday, the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell, said that Iraq had followed a policy of "denial and deception" in evading its clear obligation, set out in successive UN resolutions, to destroy its weapons of mass destruction and to co-operate in that task with UN weapons inspectors.</p>
<p>Not only did General Powell assert this claim; he went to considerable and impressive lengths to show the world that Saddam Hussein was in possession of various chemical and biological weapons, that he has the means to produce more of those weapons, that he is intent on acquiring fissile material to produce nuclear weapons and, crucially, that he has been busily hiding those weapons from the UN's inspectors. It was a bravura performance.</p>
<p>The picture that emerged from the Colin Powell Show, featuring the testimony of defectors, fuzzy satellite images and intercepted telephone conversations between Saddam's henchmen is, as General Powell said, a "deeply troubling" one. But then the world has known for some time that Saddam is a tyrant and a menace. What was new in General Powell's presentation was the suggestion that Saddam has been able to forge some links with al-Qa'ida terrorists. On that, though, General Powell overstated his case by linking a small al-Qa'ida presence in Iraq to terrorist activity across Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Chechnya and Russia. His remarks were also at odds with a British defense intelligence document that was leaked yesterday and suggested that such a relationship has foundered.</p>
<p>The problem, as with the two dossiers on Saddam published by Downing Street, is that it is a (relatively) easy task to prove that Saddam is defying the UN, that he has gassed his own people, that he tortures his opponents, that he has invaded his neighbors and that he might be co-operating with al-Qa'ida. It is much more difficult to make the case that the best way to neutralize that threat is to launch a war on Iraq.</p>
<p>General Powell desperately needed to do that yesterday. As Secretary of State, he knows better than most members of the Bush administration how vital it is to build an international coalition. He is acutely aware, as is Tony Blair, that majority opinion in Europe and the Arab world will always be skeptical. The French Foreign Minister's response, urging the Security Council to "very significantly reinforce the capacity for monitoring and collecting information in Iraq", does not suggest that France is yet ready to help in the framing of a second UN resolution endorsing the use of force.</p>
<p>In closing, General Powell asked the international community to understand that, in the light of all that we know about Saddam and all the intelligence that the Secretary of State shared with the UN, the United Sates government could not "run the risk" of allowing Saddam to remain in power. In turn, General Powell and the Bush administration must understand that much of the rest of the world is not ready to countenance the even more terrible risks involved in a war. Such an act of aggression by the US threatens to destabilize the whole region, would be a huge encouragement to fundamentalists from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan and would virtually guarantee an upsurge in global terrorism. The policy of containment and sanctions, pursued for 12 years, has been frustrating and messy; but it has constrained Saddam. General Powell did not tell us why we must abandon it. </p>
