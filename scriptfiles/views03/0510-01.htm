<p>This is a column of tidbits -- to be sure, important tidbits.  I 
think they are part of a mosaic of our times.  But I'll let you decide 
your favorite theme that runs through them.  Here goes.
    <p>1.  Congress refuses to raise the federal minimum wage to the level 
of purchasing power that existed in 1968.  At $5.15, it is over 33% less 
now in the goods and services it can buy than what workers received 35 
years ago.  Yet Congress increases its own salaries just about every 
year -- presently indexing it to inflation at over $75 per hour plus 
great benefits and perks.
    <p>2.  After deceiving investors of tens of billions of dollars, ten 
Wall St. Firms were slapped on the wrist by the SEC and the New York 
Attorney General.  The "settlement" amounted to a total of $1.4 billion 
(much of it deductible) which is the equivalent of two drops in the 
bucket.  
    <p>There were no signs of any prosecution of the big boys.  No signs of 
investors getting much money back, though the bidding arbitration 
clauses make any real litigation unlikely.  No interest in facilitating 
the banding together of millions of investors through compulsory notices 
in mailings from these firms to their customers that invite investors to 
join together and become a powerful group for a change.  The best 
Senators could do at a recent hearing on this fraud was to wonder 
whether "Wall Street gets it."  Hope rather than tough sanctions is what 
springs eternal on Capitol Hill.
    
<p>3.  D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams issues two statements in four years 
on his grand vision for the D.C. Library system, declares doing 
something about the District's 37% functional illiteracy rate, and then 
cuts the tiny budget of the starved Library system with its 26 branches 
even further.  At the same time, he announces a $338 million tax package 
for a desired new major league baseball stadium.
    <p>4.  The Wall Street Journal reports that some insurers and critics 
believe that the giant insurance company -- AIG -- is overstating the 
severity of the medical malpractice litigation crisis as a way of 
justifying large rate increases inflicted on physicians and hospitals.  
No kidding!  This is what the insurance companies have been doing every 
time the stock market and interest rates go down on their investments.
    <p>Since the physicians never want to be sued and since organized 
medicine, like the American Medical Association and its state 
counterparts, refuses to crackdown on the small percentage of bad 
doctors who account for the lion's share of the liability payouts, they 
become willing tools of their insurers.
    <p>Abandoning their patients in gross violation of medical ethics, all 
too many physicians march on the state houses demanding variations of 
immunity from the less than one in ten litigating victims of 
incompetence or negligence that is taking 80,000 American lives a year, 
according to the Harvard School of Public Health studies.  "Patients 
Face Cancellations, Delays, Prescription Hassles," headlines the Journal.
    <p>Lost in these mindless manipulations is insensitivity to the 
enormous loss of life and preventable injuries from medical and hospital 
mayhem.
    <p>As for those costly insurance policies for physicians, take all 
their premiums and divide the dollars by the number of practicing 
physicians, the average premium would be under $10,000 a year for each 
doctor -- about a third of what physicians pay for a seasoned 
receptionist.  Instead, insurers break out physicians into over 20 
classifications to reduce the insurable pool -- as for OBGYNS -- and 
skyrocket the premium.
    
<p>5.  President Bush wants to bring democracy to Iraq but stubbornly 
refuses to support Congressional voting representation for the people of 
the District of Columbia whose sons and daughters are in Iraq.  Residents 
of the District pay full federal income taxes but have no Senators or 
Representative.
    
<p>6.  The biotechnology industry's grip on the Food and Drug 
Administration continues to deprive American consumers of their strong 
desire to have biotech food labeled as such in the supermarkets.  While 
the fish farms growing salmon oppose any disclosure and labeling of the 
dyes they are using to color the salmon pink from their real color which 
is gray.  Unlike ocean salmon whose pink color comes from their 
consumption of crustaceans, expanding farm-grown antibiotic-doused 
salmon have no such luck.
    <p>So what do you make from these snapshots of our economy and 
politics?  What do they add up to?  What is your mosaic of interpretation?
