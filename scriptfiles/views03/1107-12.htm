<p>Okay, that's it. I've had it. I have finally gotten old and tired enough to 
not worry so much about what everyone else in the whole damn world is going to 
think of me, so I can just begin to say exactly what I think without apologizing 
and without fretting over whether or not you are going to still like me once I 
say whatever it is that I have to say. <p>First, George W. Bush is an odd combination 
of ridiculous and dangerous. He's sort of an evil idiot savant. He also is the 
perfect poster boy for hypocrisy. Just this morning I heard Georgie say on the 
television that the best way to protect our homeland is to hunt our enemies down 
one by one and stop them, which I suppose means to kill them. The idiot part comes 
in when I realize that he really believes what he is saying. This guy really believes 
that he is here to wipe out evil. The savant part --- the genius --- is found 
in how he gets so many otherwise intelligent people to cheer him on. Now, to the 
hypocrisy part. President Georgie is a born again Christian, as are the vast majority 
of his adoring followers. Do they think that Jesus was just kidding around, or 
maybe having an off day, when he gave the sermon on the mount ---- and when he 
said turn the other cheek, and when he said put away your sword? Do these people 
actually believe that if Jesus himself were here on earth, he would be suggesting 
that we hunt our enemies down one by one? Really - think about it: <p>And Jesus 
said to the disciples, "Whenever you feel threatened, hunt thine enemies down 
one by one and destroy them." <p>And Peter was confused, asking, "Lord, pardon 
me, but aren't you contradicting much of what you have been teaching us?" <p>Jesus 
looked upon Peter with a smirk and said, "You are either with me or against me. 
What will it be?" <p>Peter was silent, realizing that the teachings of the Christ 
were flying right over his head. <p>The preceding passage is from the Lost Gospel 
of Rummy, recently unearthed in Iraq by someone working for Halliburton on behalf 
of the Bush administration. Lucky find, huh? <p>It's not just Georgie and his 
daddy's friends that get on my nerves. Even more baffling to me are their loyal 
fans --- fan being short for fanatic you know. These people don't seem to have 
one independent thought within a thousand mile radius of any of their brains. 
They are as impressionable as silly putty. The fact that they have been lied to, 
just like the rest of us, doesn't phase them. And I'm not just talking about the 
Richie Rich's who benefit from our nation's blossoming plutocracy; I'm talking 
about middle class folks who are being royally screwed by the objects of their 
affection. (Well, I guess that works on one level.) <p>I'm losing patience with 
this insanity. Consider the uproar in the Episcopal Church over the newly installed 
Bishop Gene Robinson. These people actually believe that God is a judgmental homophobic 
prick. How hard is it to look at this discrimination against gays and figure out 
that in another 10 to 15 years, the anti-gay position will look pretty much like 
the racially bigoted position prevalent before the civil rights movement. Learning 
from the past is definitely not a strong suit here. <p>Consider another passage 
from another lost gospel somewhere: <p>And the homophobes chanted, "If the Bishop's 
gay, we won't stay, if the Bishop's gay, we won't stay!" <p>And Jesus said, "Okay. 
Don't let the screen door hit you on the way out." <p>Truly, that would be a courageous 
and innovative response to those threatening to break away from the church because 
the Bishop is gay. It's like someone handing you the end of a rope for a tug-of-war 
and you just drop the rope --- and you drop the rope every time someone puts it 
in your hand. My wife asked a good question during the evening news: "Why do they 
want to put up resistance to anyone leaving the church?" When we don't invest 
energy in power struggle (inside our heads or out) we have so much more energy 
to spend on the things that really matter. <p>Sure, I know I am contradicting 
myself: waxing philosophic about the strongest resistance being no resistance 
at all immediately after ranting about our evil idiot savant president. But remember, 
I am tired and aging and no longer concerned with what you think of me. I am, 
by definition, temporarily insane. I don't have to make sense. Hell, Rush Limbaugh 
or Bill O'Reilly or Ann Coulter never worry about making sense, why should I? 
<p>So this article marks the beginning of a new era for me. I am crowding 50 and 
have apparently experienced some kind of a tolerance breakdown. If my tolerance 
doesn't mend itself, you will be hearing more from me on my new favorite subject, 
"What I have to say," without apology, without disclaimer, and apparently without 
much diplomacy. <p>People who don't use their blinkers piss me off too.
