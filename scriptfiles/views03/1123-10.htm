<p>November 23, 2003

<p>Honorable Nancy Pelosi<br>
Democratic Leader<br>
U.S. House of Representatives

<p>Dear Congresswoman Pelosi,

<p>I received your letter requesting my donation to help
the Democratic Party gain control of the House of Representatives in the 2004 elections.  I would like to personally tell you why I will not do so.

<p>Sadly, carts loaded with rockets and hand-made rocket
launchers pulled by donkeys rolled up before a number
of sites in Baghdad.  When launched, these relatively
low-tech weapons severely damaged the Iraqi Oil
Ministry building and the Palestine Hotel.  The hotel
has been the well known home to many foreign
journalists since the threat of an invasion of Iraq at
the beginning of 2003.  More donkey carts laden with
rockets were found luckily before they could be
launched at other sites including the Turkish and
Italian embassies and a law school.

<p>My colleague in Baghdad contacted me to report this
story for the evening news.  Out loud and half
jokingly he wondered if the donkey, looking rather
dumfounded at all the commotion, would be called in
for questioning as a possible terrorist cell.  I
explained to him that the donkey is the symbol of the
political opposition party in the United States.
Immediately, he understood the imagery and recognized
the metaphor for the current political situation here
in the United States.

<p>In your letter you say, "The only way to deal with
problems is to first acknowledge them -- candidly and truthfully."  A few Democrats, like you, may indeed be seeking to regain control of the House, the Senate, and possibly the White House.  But on the whole the party is fragmented and hell bent on being unsuccessful.

<p>For example, a campaign to energize young, college age
voters about the party was labeled "Donkeys Rock!" and headlined, at least in Florida, by Hadassah Lieberman.

<p>One big problem the Democrats had in the 2000
Presidential election was the voter eligibility list
in the state of Florida.  This list, known to be
inaccurate at such a rate that a handful of the 67
Supervisors of Elections here in Florida refused to
use it, was still being used during the 2002
governor's race.  When specifically asked during a
nationally televised interview what the party was
doing about this situation, Democratic National
Committee chair Terry McAuliffe said that he only
focuses on winning the White House.  Thousands of
people, mostly poor, mostly people of color, mostly
Democrats were unable to cast a ballot yet again.

<p>During that 2002 governor's race, all polls showed
that Jeb Bush was (and still is) one of the most
popular governors in Florida's history - a state that
had not re-elected a Republican governor since
Reconstruction.  An exceptionally competent state
official, State Senator Daryl Jones ran for the
Democratic nomination.  Yet Democratic Party officials immediately shifted attention from the distinguished African-American leader with more than a decade of legislative experience and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to encourage Bill McBride, a Tampa attorney with no political experience or state name recognition to run for governor.  Democrats said McBride, a white man, was the Democrats only chance to beat Bush.  Rather than face the truth that Jeb Bush was unbeatable in 2002, and admirably work toward advancing the name recognition of someone who could retake Tallahassee in 2006, the party again disenfranchised the base.

<p>My own U.S. Representative, Jim Davis votes so often
with President Bush, I'm not really sure why he
considers himself a Democrat.  He gave the President
fast track authority after promising labor unions he
would not.  He voted, as did many Democrats, to
relieve himself of his Constitutional obligation to
determine when we as a nation go to war.

<p>At the November 2002 election, I cast my ballot then
changed party affiliation.  Until that point, I was a
Democrat for more than 20 years.  But, Davis is not
alone.

<p>Tom Daschle, the Democratic "leader" in the Senate,
supports the very energy bill you criticize in your
letter.  Isn't Senator Daschle aware of the truth that
the majority of federal agriculture subsidies go to agribusinesses that have decimated the family farmer?

<p>And, there are many, many more examples.

<p>What good is having more Democrats in the House, if
your colleagues will do what is necessary to refill
re-election accounts but refuse to fight the hard and
just battles around the nation and abroad?  I suggest
this lends more to the perception that Democrats are
soft on defense.

<p>To win elections the Democrats must have more than
"Anyone But Bush" on the ballot.

<p>In 2004, you will be at least one election late and
one Democrat short.

<p>Cordially,

<p>Randi M. Zimmerman
