<p>SCHWARZENEGGER. A candidate for our times. A family man who glorifies misogyny. In after-school programs, he wants a chalkboard for every child. On movie screens, he erases everyone in sight. Yesterday's penniless immigrant. Today's penny pincher on services to illegal immigrants. He promises unity for California. He pummels people with urinals in his films.



<p>Schwarzenegger. He wants your vote at the recall. Do you have Total Recall about him?



<p>Democratic strategists all over California are trying to figure out how to knock a few inches off the chest of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the action actor who is casting for the lead role of "Kindergarten Governor: Reagan's Revenge."



<p>Assuming the Democrats can survive their own Collateral Damage, which is increasingly doubtful for the Oct. 7 recall vote of Governor Gray Davis, it ought to be as easy as saying, "hasta la vista, baby."



<p>All you have to do is use Schwarzenegger's films and his hype of his films against himself. A man who has dedicated so much celluloid to pulverizing people leaves a whole lot of questions in his wake. Have his doctors checked him out for anger management? Never has a politician promised such a bright future with a film resume so grim, nightmarish, and deluded.



<p>Schwarzenegger is running as a Republican, but he stunned conservatives by contributing $1 million of his own money to the victorious state ballot initiative that calls for the California legislature to fund after-school programs.



<p>Two weeks ago, Schwarzenegger said, "It is very important that our children have the first access to our state treasury and get the money so they can have great schools and great education."



<p>That sounds moderate enough. Schwarzenegger has even done a couple of child-friendly movies. Schwarzenegger is also for abortion rights. He says homosexuality is "legitimate." He has said, "You're going to lose until you become a party of inclusion, that you love the foreigner that comes in with no money as much as a gay person, as a lesbian person, as anyone else -- someone that is uneducated, someone who's from the inner city."



<p>The problem is that for most of his cinematic career, Schwarzenegger has hardly been a role model for kids. Hundreds of people have died in gratuitous cinematic violence. Where most athletes face bans for use of steroids, he used them to build his body.



<p>He makes a big deal out of being "received by Californians with open arms in 1968 when I came here as an immigrant, when I had no money." He said "Californians reached out and helped me to be where I am today." When it was his turn to reach out and help the next generation of immigrants, Schwarzenegger supported Proposition 187, the 1994 measure that blocked undocumented immigrants from receiving social services -- even though everyone knows our cheap prices for California produce come from their cheap labor. A cochairman of Schwarzenegger's campaign is Pete Wilson, the former California governor who fought for Prop. 187. Wilson also stumped in 1996 for Prop. 209, which eliminated state-sponsored affirmative action in California.



<p>The immigrant Schwarzenegger contributed mightily to the laundry list of stereotypes in his movies. In the film "True Lies," Arabs were depicted as crazed animals with fanaticism bulging out of their eyeballs.



<p>Schwarzenegger says, "We want to make sure the mothers have affordable day care." In his movies, Schwarzenegger took care of women all right. In "Total Recall," he ends a death-duel with his wife by shooting her between the eyes and saying, "Consider that a divorce." In "True Lies," he makes his wife do a humiliating strip tease.



<p>In his current movie, "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Schwarzenegger bashes a female terminator in the head with a urinal. "How many times do you get away with this -- to take a woman, grab her upside down and bury her face in a toilet bowl?" Schwarzenegger said last month. "The thing is, you can do it because in the end, I didn't do it to a woman -- she's a machine! We could get away with it without being crucified by who knows what group."



<p>What's up with Schwarzenegger and urinals anyway? In "True Lies," he bashes another villain's head into a urinal. It's pretty hard to help children when your own work is so infantile. He wants the governor's office, but he so often seems to need a governess. He has said when he sees a blond with large breasts, "You say to yourself, `Hey, she must be stupid or must have nothing else to offer, which maybe is the case many times.



<p>"But then again there is the one that is as smart as her breasts look, great as her face looks, beautiful as her whole body looks -- gorgeous, you know, so people are shocked."



<p>Now the voters get to decide if this man with a steroid chest has anything to offer.



<p>Schwarzenegger. Recall or Total Recall? Terminator or Terminated? Truth or True Lies? Opening Oct. 7. At voting booths everywhere in California.
