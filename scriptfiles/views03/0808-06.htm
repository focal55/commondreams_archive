<p>What is it we're bringing to Iraq? Oh yeah, democracy. One body at a time.

<p>Now that two of Saddam Hussein's evil offspring are deader than doornails (whoop! whoop!), majority rule, free and fair elections, constitutional government, maybe even butterfly ballots and $2,000-a-plate fund-raisers - the works - are pretty much right around the corner. Or not.

<p>Before we try to topple another dictator and liberate another country, perhaps next time with the help of new-generation, low-yield, precision-guided nuclear weapons, let's thrust a limb into the gears of our trillion-dollar war machine long enough to ponder its basic assumption: that is, that it gets results.

<p>We've been at war with Iraq for 12 years now - bluntly, brutally, stupidly. We have a certain amount to show, to be sure, for those dozen debate-free years of draconian sanctions bookended by lopsided military victories: two dead Hussein boys, some toppled statues, and American-British control of the world's second-largest oil reserve (just like the old days).

<p>What we don't have is a just peace, the love of the people, or anything that resembles basic social stability there (obligating massive, indefinite U.S. troop presence and a $4-billion-a-month investment at a time when every state in our own country is going bankrupt); or, on the home front, freedom from the fear of terrorism.

<p>As we chatter about democracy and debate what to do next, I suggest that we start by asking for forgiveness and owning up, like a recovering alcoholic, to the ghastly mess we've made of things.

<p>I refer not to the mess of the last four months but the stunningly unnoticed, underreported mess of the previous decade-plus: the dismantling of a once-prosperous, secular nation with a huge middle class, a 90 percent literacy rate and perhaps the most liberated, educated female population in the Muslim world.

<p>United Nations and other observers sounded the alarm for years. The trade embargo we imposed on Saddam Hussein's Iraq after Gulf War I - the "monstrous social experiment," as writer David Sharrock of London's the Guardian put it - brought incalculable misery to the people and solidified the power of the guy we were trying to get rid of.

<p>It killed a lot of children - half a million, a million. They died of curable diseases because the country no longer had sufficient medical supplies, proper sanitation or a functioning economy that kept its population adequately fed and housed.

<p>What we did in fact accomplish was to obliterate Iraq's middle class (both through destruction of its economic base and mass emigration), halve its literacy rate, create a flourishing black market in the basic necessities of life and reduce the mass of Iraqis to abject dependence on the largesse of Saddam Hussein for their daily bread.

<p>We also drove the country into the religious Dark Ages. While democracy takes root in prosperity, religious fundamentalism flourishes in poverty. Iraq's emancipated women gradually lost their rights, the hijab (Muslim head scarf) reappeared as required wear, "honor killings" of women for alleged sexual misconduct increased and prostitution became widespread.

<p>Yet Saddam was so entrenched in power after a dozen years of sanctions, so able to preen as a threat to us, that we had to apply massive military shock and awe to his hollow regime before we could lasso his statue off its pedestal.

<p>Plenty of repressive regimes and dictators as bad as or worse than Saddam have been removed from power in recent years - in the Philippines, South Africa, Indonesia, Eastern Europe and elsewhere - through often nonviolent "people power." Gandhi called it satyagraha: self-sacrifice and principled refusal to cooperate with injustice.

<p>This kind of struggle requires an empowered populace determined to gain their own freedom. Not only did we avoid encouraging any such movement in Iraq these last 12 years, we actively, vigorously sabotaged it (above and beyond our betrayal of the Kurds).


<p>Now we blather about democracy and give them road kill.
