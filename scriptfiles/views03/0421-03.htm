<p>"THE MOURNING becomes unbearable," writes Piotr Michalowski, a professor of Near East Studies at the University of Michigan, to other scholars. 

<p>"I sit at my desk looking at a photo of a woman's head made of marble, whose empty eyes have stared back at me for my whole adult life. This amazing face had survived for more than 5,000 years. Now, together with approximately 170,000 other objects -- statues, stele, figurines, vases, cups, diadems, clay tablets inscribed with everyday accounts as well as with hymns, myths and epic poems -- it has been brutally ripped from its shelf and has very likely disappeared forever." 

<p>We have yet to grasp what the world has lost. It was not just Iraq's cultural heritage that has vanished. We who live in the Bay Area, on the western edge of the Western world, should never forget that Mesopotamia was the cradle of our own civilization as well. 

<p>In a petition to the United Nations, a group of international scholars describes the extent of our loss: "Mesopotamia," they write, "is the land where human beings first built cities, organized complex states, formulated elaborate religious beliefs, invented writing, developed sophisticated visual and literary expression, and articulated measures for maintaining law and justice." 

<p>As reporters walked through Iraq's plundered national museum, they saw priceless treasures -- antiquities and artifacts -- smashed on the floor, broken in tens of thousands of pieces. Robert Fisk, of the London newspaper the Independent, wrote, "Our feet crunched on the wreckage of 5,000 marble plinths and stone statuary and pots that had endured every siege of Baghdad, only to be destroyed when America came to 'liberate' the city." 

<p>Some of the museum's staff members wept when they saw the devastation. Nabhal Amin, the deputy director of the museum, said, "They have looted or destroyed items of antiquity dating back thousands of years. They were worth billions of dollars." 

<p>But it is not the loss of dollars that has prompted so many tears. It is the loss of priceless artifacts of Western civilization itself. 

<p>Nor did the damage end with the sacking of the museum. Looters -- a combination of professionals and local mobs -- also ransacked, gutted and burned Iraq's national library and archives, which housed precious books, historical manuscripts and newspapers. They also stole the rare-books collection at the University of Mosul. Gone, too, is the Islamic Library of the Koran, a collection housed at the Ministry of Religious Endowment, which protected ancient Korans, some handwritten and a thousand years old. 

<p>And so the record of history, back to some of the first written words, the earliest sculptures, the first glorious jewelry, has been wiped out. 

<p>The response by American officials to this cultural catastrophe can only be described as coldly indifferent. "We didn't allow it to happen," said Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. "It just happened." 

<p>True. But we did nothing to prevent such wanton destruction -- a violation of The Hague Convention of 1954, which requires armed forces to protect cultural artifacts and works of art in times of war. At a Pentagon briefing, Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, "It's as much as anything else a matter of priorities." 

<p>Precisely. We made sure U.S. troops guarded and sealed off the Ministry of Interior, which houses Iraq's vast intelligence archives and the Ministry of Oil, which contains the nation's files on its oil fields and massive reserves. 

<p>You may wonder why I focus on these cultural losses, when soldiers and civilians have also perished in this war. I mourn for them as well. But as a historian, I know that both people and the historical record they leave behind are irreplaceable. 

<p>That is why, when threatened by an earthquake or fire, we grab our loved ones and the family photographs. Anything else can be rebuilt by Bechtel.
