<p><I>The question is this: are we to </I><I>be controlled by accidents, by </I><I>tyrants, or by ourselves in ef</I><I>fective cultural design?</I> 

<P><I>&#151; Burrhus Frederic Skinner, </I><I>Cumulative Record</I> 

<P> 

<P>We are entering an era of increasing national discipline and it is happening because the government is paying closer attention to us. That is good news for those who dislike the lack of order that accompanies an undisciplined society. The first beneficiaries of the new order are federal judges. 

<P>Federal judges can be more independent than other mortals. That is apparent not only to lawyers and litigants but also to members of Congress, many of whom are more than mere mortals and, thus, possessed of better sense than federal judges. 

<P>One of the areas in which Congress has better sense than federal judges is in deciding what punishments fit what crimes. In the old days, which existed until about 20 years ago, the determination of the sorts of punishments that fit the crimes was left up to the judges who heard cases. That changed in 1984, when Congress created a Federal Sentencing Commission to set ranges in sentencing. The commission came up with recommended sentences for different kinds of crimes. As one federal judge commented to me shortly after the guidelines were announced, it significantly reduced his ability to take advantage, when sentencing, of things he had learned about the defendant in the course of a trial that would, in the old days, have enabled him to tailor a punishment to fit the crime. Instead, he was forced to impose a punishment decided on by a congressionally created commission. Nonetheless, as originally structured, the commission guidelines, while delineating sentencing ranges, allowed judges to depart downward for unusual factors. 

<P>Members of Congress, only a few of whom have had personal experience with the criminal justice system (and those, gratefully, are no longer members of Congress) were outraged that federal judges in some jurisdictions continued to impose sentences lower than those recommended by the commission. According to a report in The New York Times, in 2001 in 18 per cent of the sentences imposed, federal judges showed leniency to defendants who were not cooperating witnesses. Congress believed its guidelines should be slavishly followed in most, if not all, cases. 

<P>So, as part of the Amber Alert bill that sets up a national alert system for child abductions, Congress instructed the commission to create rules that further reduce the opportunity for trial-court judges to set sentences lower than those imposed by the guideline, effectively creating mandatory minimums for certain prescribed offenses. 

<P>The new legislation tells appeals courts not to show deference to trial courts whose sentences are below the minimums when reviewing the imposed sentences, thus permitting appellate courts to impose sentences they believe appropriate irrespective of what the trial judge may have thought. It instructs the sentencing commission to rewrite portions of the guidelines to reduce the circumstances under which a court may depart downward from a guideline-mandated sentence and it requires that all downward departures, and the names of the judges who issued them, be reported to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The task of monitoring judges is given to the Justice Department. Although it is unclear what the Justice Department or Congress can do if dissatisfied with a judge's conduct, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft will probably figure out how to deal with a recalcitrant judge. 

<P>Judges are not the only thing the Justice Department will begin monitoring. 

<P>On April 24 it was reported that on March 27 the Justice Department issued a directive to employees to inform its Office of Legislative Affairs "ahead of time and as soon as possible &#151; of all potential briefings on Capitol Hill and significant, substantive conversations with staff and members on Capitol Hill. We will assist in determining the appropriateness of proceeding with potential briefings" the directive said. Jamie E. Brown said the directive was issued "in response to a request by the Attorney General. Not only does the directive demand advance notification. It says that employees will almost always be accompanied to briefings by "liaison officials." (Liaison officials are similar to the "minders" who accompanied U.N. inspection teams when they visited with Iraqi scientists before the war.) The directive requests employees to "please let us know when you receive a phone call from or plan to place a call to House and Senate staff and members." 

<P>Like monitoring federal judges, which the Justice Department would quickly advise is not intended to intimidate the judiciary, this directive is not intended to limit what staff members say to members of Congress or their staff, even though some members of Congress may see it differently. 

<P>Sen. Charles Grassley called the order "an attempt to muzzle whistle-blowers." He says the order had a chilling effect and had "dampened people that would normally be comfortable about talking." Barbara Comstock, director of the Office of Public Affairs at the Justice Department, said the directive was intended to coordinate efforts to keep Congress informed. As she explained: "It's a way of folks knowing what's going on in our department." That's as benign an explanation as we're apt to get. 

<P>Any similarity between the activities of the Ashcroft Justice Department and justice is purely coincidental.
