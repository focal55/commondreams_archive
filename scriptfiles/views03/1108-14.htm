<p>Everything seemed to be going so well for Howard Dean, the frontrunner in America's 
contest for the Democratic presidential nomination. Then he made a throwaway remark 
that changed everything: he wanted, he said, "to be the candidate for guys with 
Confederate flags in their pickup trucks". Dean's error was to evoke the divisive 
Confederate symbol, hated by black Americans as standing for slavery and still 
upheld by many Southern conservatives as representing their "heritage". Because 
he was the frontrunner, other Democratic candidates seized on the opportunity 
to create a controversy, implying that Dean is racist. <p>The immediate effect 
was to slow his momentum. <p>But, as with many so-called gaffes, his comment alluded 
to a fundamental political truth: the Democratic and Republican parties have traded 
places after decades of struggle over civil rights. The solid South of the old 
Confederacy, which once voted uniformly for the Democrats, is now the bastion 
of the Republicans. <p>From the beginning of the Democratic party, through the 
civil war and the New Deal, the South was the foundation stone of the party's 
national strength. With the coming of the civil-rights revolution, Democratic 
presidents Kennedy and Johnson deployed the federal government to support social 
equality. In reaction, Republicans - from Goldwater to Nixon to Reagan - developed 
a Southern strategy to win over white voters in the region who felt betrayed. 
That strategy involved using widely understood code going back to the civil war 
- phrases like "states' rights", used to justify slavery - in an updating of the 
well-worn strategy of invoking race to keep poor white and black Americans divided 
on issues of common interest. Thus the party of Lincoln became the party of Reagan. 
<p>Dean, the former Vermont governor, raised in New York City, is the most distinctly 
old-line Yankee to emerge to prominence within the Democratic party in living 
memory. Despite his New England pedigree, George Bush is a man of the Republican 
South. If selected, Dean will challenge the first conservative Southern president 
in modern US history. The possible confrontation reflects the deeper polarisations 
of race, class and society that are driving the country apart. <p>In March, Dean 
described the thinking behind his controversial remark more fully: "I think the 
Republicans, ever since 1968, with Richard Nixon's Southern strategy, have divided 
us on race issues. Look, when I go to the South, I talk about race deliberately... 
If we're going to have elections about race, we might as well talk about it openly. 
I want white males, particularly in the South, to come back to the Democratic 
party. And the case that FDR made was, look, when was the last time you all got 
a raise? When was the last time your kids got decent health insurance? What kind 
of schools do your kids go to if you can't afford a private academy?" <p>His problem 
is that, this time, he left off the filigree of Nixon and Roosevelt. And so, for 
days after his gaffe, Dean engaged in the etiquette of fulsome apologies. He began 
by condemning the Confederate flag as "a painful symbol", then asked for forgiveness 
from "any people in the South who thought they were being stereotyped". A day 
later he called his language "clumsy", and added: "I deeply regret the pain that 
I may have caused." An overdue discussion of the Republicans' Southern strategy 
was replaced by bowing and scraping. <p>Dean's Confederate flag problem coincided 
with another, seemingly unrelated, difficulty - over a mini-series, The Reagans, 
commissioned by the television network CBS. The intersection was less odd than 
it appears; Reagan and the Confederate flag, after all, have long been for the 
Southern Republican party the equivalent of apple pie and motherhood. <p>The Reagans 
mini-series is the latest in a long line of cheesy TV productions mangling the 
lives of the presidents, though no one has chosen to politicise these tabloid 
productions until now. This time, a Republican mole filched a copy of the script, 
and the Republican party chairman, Ed Gillespie, assumed the pose of historian. 
The script put words into the mouth of Reagan - like these about Aids sufferers: 
"They that live in sin shall die in sin" (what he actually said was: "Maybe the 
Lord brought down this plague", because "illicit sex is against the Ten Commandments"). 
Gillespie called on CBS to pull the series or flash a warning on screen every 
10 minutes that it was make-believe. CBS promptly crumpled, pulling the show from 
the network schedule. Leslie Moonves, the CBS president, abased himself with abject 
apologies. <p>The Reagans, judging from leaked excerpts of the script, features 
a distracted Ronnie and harridan Nancy, a melding of 1950s situation comedy and 
Mommy Dearest. Policy and politics are not its centrepieces. Certain crucial events 
in the rise of Reagan are noticeably missing. The actual words on race and civil 
rights, essential to his political success, are absent, though the Republicans 
haven't complained. <p>Some true-life scenes: Reagan opposed the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (calling it "humiliating to 
the South"), and ran for governor of California in 1966 promising to wipe the 
Fair Housing Act off the books. "If an individual wants to discriminate against 
Negroes or others in selling or renting his house," he said, "he has a right to 
do so." After the Republican convention in 1980, Reagan travelled to the county 
fair in Neshoba, Mississippi, where, in 1964, three Freedom Riders had been slain 
by the Ku Klux Klan. Before an all-white crowd of tens of thousands, Reagan declared: 
"I believe in states' rights". <p>As president, Reagan aligned his justice department 
on the side of segregation, supporting the fundamentalist Bob Jones University 
in its case seeking federal funds for institutions that discriminate on the basis 
of race. In 1983, when the supreme court decided against Bob Jones, Reagan, under 
fire from his right in the aftermath, gutted the Civil Rights Commission. <p>Reagan 
consolidated the Southern strategy that Nixon formulated in response to the civil 
rights movement. It is this Republican party that has created the radically conservative 
Southern presidency of Bush. When Bush's candidacy was threatened in the Republican 
primaries of 2000, he rescued himself by appearing at Bob Jones University and 
wrapping himself in support of the preservation of the Confederate emblem on the 
South Carolina state flag. <p>Dean's remarks were awkward, but his challenge to 
the Republican party's basic character and the need for a strategy for defeating 
it will inevitably be revisited by whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, if 
that nominee cares about winning. <p>On the day before Dean's last apology, Haley 
Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and the third-biggest 
lobbyist in Washington, was elected governor of Mississippi. He had campaigned 
at an event sponsored by the Council of Concerned Conservatives, an overtly racist 
group and successor organisation to the White Citizens' Council, which led opposition 
to civil rights in the 1960s. In his lapel, Barbour wore a pin of the Mississippi 
state flag, a matter of controversy because of its incorporation of the Confederate 
flag. On election night, even before he was announced as the winner, Barbour received 
a congratulatory telephone call from Bush. Look away, Dixieland. <p>As the great 
novelist William Faulkner, of Mississippi, wrote: "The past is not dead. In fact, 
it's not even past." <p><I>· Sidney Blumenthal is a former assistant and senior
