<p>Eleven years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it was pulling 
silicone breast implants from the market, leaving them available only to breast 
cancer survivors who needed them for reconstruction or to women enrolled in limited 
clinical studies. <p>The reason for the action, announced then-FDA Commissioner 
David Kessler, was that, under the law, "these types of products have to be shown 
by their manufacturer to be safe and effective before they may be distributed 
and used. Some people argue that the devices have to be proven unsafe before the 
FDA can act to protect patients against their use. This is not so. The burden 
of proof is an affirmative one and it rests with the manufacturer. In this instance, 
the manufacturers have not shown these devices to be safe." <p>Although silicone 
breast implants had been on the market for three decades, Kessler said, "the list 
of unanswered questions is long." <p>"We do not know how long these devices will 
last," he said. <p>"We know that some of these implants will rupture, but we don't 
know how many of them will rupture," he pointed out. <p>And, he said, "We don't 
know whether there is any link between the implants and immune-related disorders 
and other systemic diseases." <p>"Until these basic questions are satisfactorily 
answered, we cannot approve these devices." <p>Fast forward to the present. <p>Dow 
Corning, the leading manufacturer of silicone implants more than a decade ago, 
is in bankruptcy. <p>Inamed, a California-based company, is now seeking marketing 
authorization from the FDA for silicone breast implants. <p>More than a decade 
has passed since the FDA restricted sales of silicone implants, but Inamed only 
submitted to FDA three years worth of data from a study projected to continue 
for 10 years. The company sells silicone implants in Europe and more than 60 countries 
worldwide, but it hasn't collected any safety information from women in those 
countries that is of high enough quality to submit to FDA. <p>As a result, we 
still don't know the answers to many of the questions Kessler identified, and 
most of what we do know is frightening. <p>What we do know is that painful breast 
hardening which can lead to deformity, dead tissue, loss of nipple sensation, 
infections and rashes are common complications from silicone implants. <p>We know 
that rupture rates leading silicone to spread throughout the body are extremely 
high over the long term -- occurring in more than half or two thirds of women 
after 10 years, according to two studies. <p>We don't know whether there is any 
link between the implants and immune-related disorders and other systemic diseases, 
though there is worrying evidence that they do. <p>We started to ask Inamed spokesperson 
Peter Nicholson about these matters, but he'd only say that the data Inamed submitted 
to the FDA was available on the web, and the company would not be commenting further. 
<p>Inamed's data are indeed striking. <p>Even though the company reported on only 
three year's test results, the numbers show significant short-term problems. After 
just three years, one in five augmentation patients and almost half of reconstruction 
patients required additional surgeries. <p>Inamed's data did not show particularly 
high rupture rates during the three-year period of study -- in no small part because 
it only provided MRIs to about a third of the women in the study, and silicone 
rupture can only be detected through MRIs. <p>Inamed's data were replete with 
other flaws. For example, the company misleadingly claimed a low incidence of 
lactation problems, by comparing the incidence of problems to the overall population 
of women receiving augmentation, not just those who tried to breastfeed. <p>These 
and other problems were pointed out by advocacy groups at an FDA advisory committee 
hearing convened last month to issue a recommendation on whether Inamed's marketing 
application should be approved. <p>The advisory committee also heard heart-wrenching 
testimony from more than two dozen women with silicone implants. They described 
the extreme pain and life-changing problems they have suffered as a result of 
silicone implants in terms that could fail to move only those with hardened hearts. 
And several highlighted an important economic component -- health insurance plans 
generally do not cover surgeries to remove implants for augmentation patients, 
placing a huge financial burden on sick women. <p>Nonetheless, the advisory panel, 
a quarter of whom are plastic surgeons, and at least one of whom was swayed by 
empty promises from Inamed to do ongoing follow-up research, voted 9-6 to recommend 
the FDA approve Inamed's request. <p>The failure for a larger majority to support 
the application leaves it awkward for FDA to recommend approval. <p>Inamed's chances 
of approval worsened last week, when Dr. Thomas Whalen, the non-voting chair of 
the advisory panel, in a highly unusual move, sent a letter to FDA commissioner 
Mark McClellan. Whalen called the panel decision "misguided," emphasizing the 
lack of data on long-term safety. He felt "morally compelled" to urge the FDA 
to deny approval, he told reporters. <p>Now the decision rests with FDA Commissioner 
Mark McClellan. <p>The law hasn't changed since the time the FDA ordered silicone 
implants off the market. The agency faces the same choice it faced in 1992, with 
little new information - and much of the recent information indicating the implants' 
hazards. <p>If the FDA upholds its obligation under the law to approve products 
only that afford "a reasonable assurance of safety," it has no choice but to deny 
approval. <p>You can help influence the decision. Send a message to FDA Commissioner 
McClellan urging him not to approve Inamed's application. You can do this from
