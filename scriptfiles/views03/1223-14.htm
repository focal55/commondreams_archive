<p>Few Americans now remember that George W. Bush's father was elected president 
in 1988 in one of the most racist campaigns ever staged in the United States. 
Now W. seems poised to follow in those tainted footsteps. 
<p>
But the "issue" this time won't be race, it'll be gay marriage.   
<p>
Early in the 1988 campaign, then-Vice President George H.W. Bush trailed 
then-Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis by as much as 15 points in the 
mainstream polls. Bush was sunk in a scandal-ridden Reagan Administration whose 
trademark was Iran Contra, the bizarre scam in which the Reaganites had illegally 
sold arms to Iranian fanatics and slipped the profits to right-wing contra 
rebels trying to overthrow the duly elected Sandinista government of Nicaragua. 
Reagan also sold chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to Iraqi 
dictator, Saddam Hussein.  Reagan's envoy to Saddam was now-Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld. 
<p>
Reagan was always more popular with the media than with the general public. 
Constantly proclaiming support for a balanced budget amendment, Reagan left the 
largest deficits in US history (until the coming of George W. Bush). 
<p>
Bush One's run against Dukakis was hampered by his aloof, upper-crust lack of 
charisma. Running mate Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana was noted mainly for his 
deer-in-headlights demeanor.  In a crucial televised debate, Quayle was utterly 
demolished by Dukakis's running mate, Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen.
<p>
But the Bush-Quayle team had a trump card---racism. Lee Atwater, the Karl 
Rove of the day, was a hard-driving, below-the-belt dirty trickster.  Atwater 
seized on Willie Horton, a black prisoner who'd been paroled from the 
Massachusetts penal system and then committed another crime.   
<p>
Atwater filled the air waves with brutally racist black-and-white ads meant 
to make Horton and Dukakis seem blood-related. The poisonous stench helped send 
the Democrats into a tail spin.  Atwater later developed a brain tumor, and 
repented what he had done. 
<p>
Karl Rove may soon step into Atwater's shoes.  Recent decisions by the 
Supreme Courts of the US and Massachusetts against anti-sodomy laws have thrown the 
Christian Coalition and its national network of right-wing churches into a 
self-righteous tizzy. 
<p>
For Rove, gay marriage is the new Willie Horton, a wedge issue perfectly 
suited to fire up the corporate-funded right-wing church network while diverting 
public attention from an ailing economy and a failing war effort.   
<p>
Ironically, Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter is a lesbian whose personal 
right he has defended.  As documented in David Brock's BLINDED BY THE RIGHT, 
the GOP has been continually lit up by closeted gays sickened by its vicious 
homophobia. 
<p>
Rove, in turn, has not hesitated to attack Brock and anyone else opposing the 
Republican juggernaut.  Bush has already let it be known he's inclined to 
support a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, and the Foxist media is 
starting to treat it as a major issue.   
<p>
As governor of Vermont, Howard Dean approved gay civil unions, somewhat 
different from gay marriage.  But the Bush/Rove GOP is unlikely to make such fine 
distinctions, any more than Bush One belabored the legal intricacies of the 
Willie Horton parole.  Nor will they refrain from smearing other Democrats, 
whatever their actual stance, with the nastiest possible slant on gay rights.   
<p>
What Papa Bush and Lee Atwater did to promote racism in American presidential 
campaigns, George W. and Karl Rove are poised to do for homophobia.
