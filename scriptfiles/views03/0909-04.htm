<p>"The members of (September 11th Families for) Peaceful Tomorrows have truly honored the memories of their loved ones by exploring ways to promote peace, rather than advance war," says U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee. 

<p>And the California Democrat, who cast the sole vote against handing President Bush a blank check to turn the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks into an excuse for military adventurism abroad, is precisely right. 

<p>This week will feature many memorials to those who died two years ago in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Some will be moving and responsible, some will be of a more troubling character. Bush opened what ought to be a period of remembrance and reflection with a Sunday night attempt to take grief over the losses of Sept. 11 and fear of terrorism, and link them with his disastrous invasion of Iraq. 

<p>Were the television networks the least bit interested in offering Americans fresh perspectives regarding the Sept. 11 attacks and how best to respond to them, they would have followed the president's address with a reply from a member of September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows. 

<p>Formed by family members of Sept. 11 victims who did not want their grief - and the nation's sorrow - turned into an excuse for war, the group declares, "Our mission is to seek effective, nonviolent solutions to terrorism, and to acknowledge our common experience with all people similarly affected by violence throughout the world. By conscientiously exploring peaceful options in our search for justice, we hope to spare additional families the suffering we have experienced - as well as to break the cycle of violence and retaliation engendered by war. In doing so, we work to create a safer world for the present and future generations." 

<p>The dozens of families who have forged this remarkable group come from different parts of the United States, different religions, different ethnic backgrounds and different political traditions. They are realists who support the multilateral use of sensible and appropriate means to bring those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks to justice in accordance with the principles of international law. 

<p>But they are united in a basic belief that is well expressed by David Potorti, whose brother, Jim, worked on the 96th floor of the World Trade Center and died in the collapse of that building two years ago. 

<p>"This is our tragedy. This is not George Bush's tragedy," says Potorti, who lives in North Carolina. What is frustrating to Potorti is his sense that too little attention is paid to the human tragedies of Sept. 11, and too much to the latest targets of Bush's perpetual - if not particularly successful - war. 

<p>"We don't talk about the victims anymore," Potorti says. "We just think about Saddam and Osama." 

<p>Potorti has given voice to the families of the victims in an important new book, "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=commondreams-20&path=tg/detail/-/0971920648/qid%3D1062696131/sr%3D8-1" target="_new">September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows: Turning Our Grief Into Action for Peace</a></i>" (RDV Books/Akashic Books). And he is speaking out frequently, as are other members of the group. 

<p>At an August rally calling on the Bush administration to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq, Potorti noted that "our group has written to the president on four occasions, asking him to meet with us, and to stop using our family members, killed on September 11, as a reason for taking actions that will cause the deaths of other innocent family members." 

<p>Bush has chosen to ignore the voices of these families. As the second anniversary of the Sept. 11 tragedy approaches, the American people should be better than their president. We should listen, and learn from those who have turned their grief into activism that seeks to ensure that the cycle of violence - and sorrow - will stop.
