<p>"How did Dennis Kucinich and Al Sharpton and Carol Moseley Braun get 
 into this thing?" ABC's Ted Koppel complained before the Democratic 
 candidates' debate that he moderated this week. "Nobody seems to know. 
 Some candidates who are perceived as serious are gasping for air, and 
 what little oxygen there is on the stage will be taken up by one-third 
 of the people who do not have a snowball's chance in hell of
 	winning the nomination."

<p>This frustration came out at the debate, as Koppel quizzed all three 
 non-"serious" candidates: "You don't have any money, at least not 
 much. Rev. Sharpton has almost none. You don't have very much, 
 Ambassador Braun. The question is, will there come a point when polls, 
 money and then ultimately the actual votes that will take place...will 
 there come a point when we can expect one or more of the three of you 
 to drop out? Or are you in this as sort of a vanity candidacy?"

<p>Kucinich responded with a dig at the industry that Koppel works for: 
 "I want the American people to see where the media takes politics in 
 this country. To start with endorsements, to start talking about 
 endorsements. Now we're talking about polls. And then we're talking 
 about money. Well, you know, when you do that, you don't have to talk 
 about what's important to the American people."

<p>Was it a coincidence that the day after this exchange, ABC News 
 pulled the only journalist it had following the Kucinich campaign, 
 along with the two producers covering the two other potential "vanity" 
 candidates?  Whether retaliatory or not, ABC's action signaled its 
 agreement with Koppel's assessment: Kucinich, Sharpton and Moseley 
 Braun don't have a snowball's chance of being nominated, and it's time 
 for them to get off the stage.

<p>	But why don't these candidates have any chance of winning?  Is it 
 because their records and campaign promises have been scrutinized by 
 the American public and found wanting?  It's hard to say that the 
 viewers of Nightline, the show hosted by Koppel, have had much of a 
 chance to scrutinize those three: None of them had been mentioned on 
 the show all year until it aired a portion of this week's debate.

<p>	Perhaps ABC would say that Nightline, a discussion show that 
 generally covers only one topic a night, is not where it provides 
 regular coverage of presidential candidates.  What about World News 
 Tonight, ABC's nightly news program--would a regular viewer of that 
 show have learned enough about the supposedly oxygen-stealing 
 candidates to make an informed judgment that they aren't worth hearing 
 from?

 <p>	Altogether, Kucinich, Sharpton and Moseley Braun have been mentioned 
 a combined total of 10 times on World News Tonight so far this year. 
 If you watched every day, you'd know that Kucinich wants to withdraw 
 U.S. troops from Iraq, is critical of a power company connected to 
 last summer's blackouts, and met with someone trying to bring 
 attention to the plight of black farmers.  You'd have heard Sharpton 
 described as a good speaker, and heard him being critical of George W. 
 Bush's military accomplishments, of Howard Dean's references to the 
 Confederate flag and of Democratic in-fighting.  Of Moseley Braun, 
 you'd learn that she's running for president, and sees herself as a 
 clear alternative to Bush.

 <p>	That's it--you would not have gleaned any more facts about these 
 candidates from watching ABC's main news program for the entire year. 
 Could it be that ABC believes that on the basis of this information 
 alone, voters ought to be able to make up their minds about what kind 
 of presidents these hopefuls would make?  That seems doubtful--who 
 would think that a decision so weighty should be based on knowledge so 
 sketchy?

<p> 	Or does ABC think that people should be going elsewhere to get their 
 news about the election campaign--that the network doesn't need to 
 bother providing information about these  candidates, because 
 responsible voters will be finding out what they need to know to cast 
 an informed ballot from other outlets?  That, too, is unlikely to be 
 the position of a network that used to boast of being America's No. 1 
 news source.

<p> 	So the folks at ABC News can't believe that they've given you enough 
 information to make up your own mind, and they must not think that you 
 should go someplace else to get that information. Yet they think that 
 it's time to stop covering the candidates who are not "perceived to be 
 serious," and leave the stage to others.

<p>	Only one conclusion is possible:  It's not for you to decide who's a 
 serious candidate for president and who's not.  That's ABC's job.
