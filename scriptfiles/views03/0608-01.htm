<p><i>"The Almighty God ... expects each person to be treated with dignity .... It's the call of all religions, that each person must be free and treated with respect."<P></P></i><b>&#8212; George W. Bush, speaking to Arab leaders last week in Egypt<P></P></b><i>"We will ensure that all Iraqis have... their rights protected."<P></P></i><b>&#8212; Bush last month, promising democracy for Iraq</b><P></P>Lofty American ideals are preached abroad but breached at home. But first, a joke that gets at this hypocrisy.<P></P>Some American Muslims, buoyed by their increasing numbers due to immigration and a high conversion rate, used to daydream that America would one day become a Muslim nation. And lo and behold, it did overnight, after Sept. 11: <P></P>Civilians were picked up in the middle of the night without warrants; locked up in secret cells without charge; denied legal counsel, bail or access to family and friends; kept under bright lights 24 hours a day; and subjected to severe verbal, psychological and physical abuse, such as being slammed against a wall out of the range of surveillance cameras, and held so tightly in handcuffs, leg irons and chains as to leave deep scars.<P></P>These are standard practices of repressive regimes. And they became the norm in Bush's America for thousands of Arab and South Asian Muslims picked up on suspicion of terrorist activity. Yet virtually all were found to have no connection to terrorism, let alone 9/11.<P></P>At a forum on Capitol Hill last Wednesday attended by several members of Congress, Senator Ted Kennedy compared the treatment of the detainees to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II "when the government ran roughshod over basic rights, in the name of national security."<P></P>The administration refuses to disclose the number of people it incarcerated. Attorney-General John Ashcroft stopped giving out the total after it reached about 1,200, back in November, 2001.<P></P> "We have reason to believe the number is about 3,000, if not more," said Dalia Hashad of the American Civil Liberties Union, on the phone from New York. "Men are still disappearing."<P></P>We do have an account of 762 of them, thanks to a blistering report by the U.S. Justice Department's own internal watchdog. <P></P>The men were singled out by the FBI and jailed an average of 80 days, some up to eight months. Some had been picked up on unsubstantiated tips or paranoid whims.<P></P>A salesman with a wife and five children, all lawful permanent residents, was arrested because he had a map on which he had circled some cities. <P></P>The FBI cleared him, but immigration officials charged him with failure to file a change of address, as now is required of non-citizens.<P></P>Three men were grabbed at a New York traffic stop because they had building plans for a school they were working on. Their boss verified the fact. <P></P>Yet they were not released.<P></P>A man was nabbed after someone said he made "anti-American statements." His words were deemed not to be subversive, yet he wasn't released.<P></P>Besides being taunted and bullied, the detainees were denied their weekly phone call by guards counting busy signals and voice mail as completed calls. They were lied to, as were families and lawyers enquiring about them. But no guard has yet to face disciplinary action.<P></P>The detainees were from 20 nations, but mostly Pakistan, even though all 9/11 hijackers were Arabs. A total of 505 have been deported, including many with American wives and American-born children.<P></P>None was charged with terrorism. All were prosecuted on immigration violations, such as overstaying their visas or dodging deportations. Of the 410 Pakistanis deported, only four were felons.<P></P>The issue is not that their illegalities should have been overlooked, but that they were subjected to selective prosecution. After all, there are 320,000 people in America facing final deportation orders, and there are an estimated 5.9 million illegals.<P></P>Due process has gone out the window in several other anti-terrorism initiatives as well.<P></P>There is the ongoing violation of the Geneva Convention at Guantanamo Bay, where 650 terrorism suspects are still being held without charge or access to legal counsel. <P></P>They are foreigners and most were caught during a legitimate war. But others targeted are American residents singled out because of their religion.<P></P>There's the program of "voluntary interviews" of Muslim males, which are not all that voluntary. <P></P>There is the tracking, fingerprinting and questioning of people from 26 nations with significant Muslim populations.<P></P> There is the mandatory detention of asylum seekers from selected origins. <P></P>There is the selective enforcement of the new provision that non-citizens and non-holders of green cards must report their change of address.<P></P>Have these measures netted any terrorists? Virtually none. But they do garner populist headlines by vindictively scapegoating the most vulnerable members of society. <P></P>The measures the Bush administration is pursuing violate the most fundamental norms and values of a democratic society. They harm American credibility abroad. More important, they harm America.
