<p> My sister Rhonda and I thought we had at last found evidence of the purportedly nasty anti-Americanism here that would validate the anti-French animosity many Americans expressed when France opposed our nation's march to war against Iraq.

<p> It was at a concession stand on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles, the monument to the French royal ego located just outside the capital. A British couple in front of us who spoke no French were having trouble explaining what they wanted. The vendor rolled his eyes and sighed heavily in a display of disgust.

<p> Ah-ha, we thought: He's showing rancor toward them because the British and American governments are allies against Iraq. Here, for sure, was an example of nefariously evil Frenchdom meriting patriotic American scorn.

<p> Three days earlier, Rhonda and I waited 20 minutes for a waiter in a claustrophobic Latin Quarter restaurant. Throughout the meal, the service was unacceptably slow, and our food was delivered almost at room temperature.

<p> Ah-ha, we thought: He's snubbing us because we're Americans. But that theory later broke down when the hapless waiter apologized and explained in broken English that he was responsible for 23 tables and simply couldn't keep up.

<p> Alas, reality also exonerated the Versailles vendor. As we sat eating our ice cream, the line at the concession stand disappeared and the young man finally had a breather. Rhonda -- who, like me, doesn't speak a word of French beyond what can be found on the first pages of a travelers' phrase book -- asked him why the famed Versailles fountains weren't operating that day. He explained, in quite passable English, that there was no set schedule -- sometimes they're turned on, sometimes not.

<p> And then he asked us about America and said he'd love to visit sometime.

<p> Parisians can be rude, unhelpful, sometimes insolent -- if they notice you at all. If you don't speak their language, they will sometimes let you thrash about helplessly even if they speak yours. They're proud of their city in a way that implicitly denies the significance of everyone and everywhere else.

<p> But Rhonda and I concluded that this is also true of people in New York, where we grew up. What many outsiders interpret as rudeness is mostly just focused New Yorkers going about their business. What is often interpreted as swagger is just a rejection of false modesty concerning an undisputably great city.

<p> I'm biased. I love Paris. But I was on alert: Had our involvement in Iraq changed the French? Were they as scornful of us as so many Americans had become of them?

<p> I can find no evidence of it. Europeans in general, and the French in particular, maintain a realistic but dispassionate engagement with world affairs; they pay close attention to events but don't internalize the actions taken by governments as we Americans tend to do. Rhonda and I aren't the Bush family.

<p> The question I've most often heard during three weeks in Europe is a quite reasonable one: Why do the American people continue to support President Bush despite evidence that the case he presented for war was so flawed?

<p> From here in France, the anti-French petulance that swept America six months ago seems pathetically misplaced. After all, we're now the ones mired in the mess they warned us about.

<p> My distinct impression is that the French people opposed the war in Iraq not because they hate Americans or because they love Saddam Hussein. They opposed the war because there was no justification for supporting it.

<p> And for that, I salute them.
