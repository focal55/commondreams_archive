<p>The U.S. attack on Iraqi has brought the collapse of Saddam Hussein's 

brutal regime, which is cause for celebration. For the first time in at 

least 35 years, the conditions could exist for Iraqis to chart their own

destiny.



<p>Now the United States has a crucial part to play in making Iraqi 

self-determination a reality: It must get out.



<p>President Bush has told the Iraqi people: "We will help you build a 

peaceful and representative government that protects the rights of all 

citizens. And then our military forces will leave."



<p>Bush has the sequence wrong; a truly representative government in Iraq is 

possible only if U.S. military forces leave first. The reason is simple:



<p>Liberating the Iraqi people was part of the Bush PR campaign to justify a 

war, but it was not the motive force behind U.S. policy. Neither were 

stated concerns about weapons of mass destruction or alleged terrorist ties.



<p>Bush's fundamental goal in Middle East policy is no different from other

administrations since World War II: To strengthen U.S. control over the 

flow of the region's oil resources and the resulting profits. In a world

that runs on oil, the nation that controls the flow of oil has considerable 

strategic power, not only over the terms of its own consumption but over

other nations. U.S. policymakers want leverage over the economies of our

biggest competitors -- Western Europe, Japan and China -- which are more

dependent on Middle Eastern oil.



<p>From this logic has flowed U.S. support for reactionary regimes (Saudi 

Arabia), dictatorships (Iran under the Shah, Iraq in the 1980s) and 

regional military surrogates (Israel) -- always aimed at maintaining 

control. A "democratic" government in Iraq will be allowed if, and only if, 

such a government lines up with U.S. interests. The United States will 

allow the trappings of a democratic process as long as the process produces 

the right result.



<p>This approach to democracy has been a consistent feature of U.S. foreign

policy. While many acknowledge that in the past the United States has 

supported dictators and derailed real democracy abroad, the conventional

wisdom is that things have changed since the end of the Cold War. Two 

recent examples suggest that though tactics may change, the goal remains

the same.



<p>In Afghanistan, U.S. support for "democracy" included strong-arm tactics at 

the loya jirga to eliminate a role for former king Zahir Shah and force his 

withdrawal as a candidate. After the fall of the Taliban, there was 

considerable support for his return to the country to play a unifying role, 

but Bush officials preferred their handpicked candidate, Hamid Karzai.



<p>In Venezuela, U.S. officials were quick to proclaim support for last year's 

abortive coup attempt that temporarily displaced the elected president, 

Hugo Chavez. Even more embarrassing was the revelation that U.S. officials 

had met with Venezuelan military officers and opposition activists, 

including the nominal leader of the coup. Because Chavez defied the United 

States, the democratic process by which he had been elected was irrelevant.

<p>What will democracy mean in Iraq? When Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 

was asked Sunday whether the United States would accept in Iraqi elections 

a victory by candidates opposed to U.S. policy, he waffled. The lack of a 

history of political freedom in Iraq meant that sometimes "people end up

not understanding what really are the facts," he said. How long does it 

take to reverse that? "It takes some time."



<p>Will Iraqis be allowed to choose their own government only when their 

understanding of the facts matches Rumsfeld's? Will U.S. occupation 

continue until Rumsfeld is satisfied with the pace and direction of Iraqi 

learning?



<p>An ongoing U.S. occupation will not be embraced by most Iraqis, with the

exception of figures such as Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress 

exile group -- a "reliable" leader (defined as willingness to accept U.S. 

orders) preferred by many in this administration.



<p>Gen. Tommy Franks has said U.S. forces will stay in Iraq "until there is a 

free government." Like his commander in chief, Franks misses the point: 

Real freedom stand a fighting chance only if the U.S. military withdraws

and a U.N. peacekeeping force takes over the work of stabilizing the 

country. American military power can remove a dictator but -- given U.S.

actions in Iraq and the Middle East -- it cannot create meaningful democracy.
