<p>Where are the weapons? Where are the weapons that our soldiers died for? Where is Saddam who we wanted to bring to justice for his torturous regime? Where is the liberation of Iraq? Where is the peace that we went to war for?


<p>I remember a short time ago when Secretary of State, Colin Powell spoke before the United Nations and presented a shopping cart full of evidence of Iraq's potential to deliver a massive attack with biological weapons. A ring of missiles around Baghdad were poised to strike. Drone aircraft were silently ready to deliver deadly payloads. Nuclear weapons were near completion. At any moment Saddam will deliver anthrax to terrorist for attacks on the U.S. His presentation was high tech and to many convincing. The administration played on Colin Powell's credibility and set the stage for acceptance of war for peace.

<p>It was at that time when I saw my friends and neighbors do an "about face" and threw in their support to President Bush and for going to war with Iraq. One day they were shouting down Bush the next day it was "Let's roll.". It was that pivotal moment in time when dissent from the right and center collapsed leaving the "blathering, Clinton loving, un-American, bleeding heart liberals" like myself left to carry signs and write letters in opposition to the invasion.

<p>Does any one care that the American public was force fed a steady diet of false information about the existence of weapons of mass destruction? The result of which has caused the fine young men and women of our armed forces to die for a "threat" that did not really exist.

<p>We hear now from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that "the weapons may have been destroyed before the war". We hear now from another neoconservative hawk, Paul Wolfowitz in an interview in the July issue of Vanity Fair, that "for bureaucratic reasons" using the threat of weapons of mass destruction "was one of the reasons that everyone could agree on". So one can infer that Colin Powell was sent to the UN with false documentation. Documentation manufactured to provide a "reason that everyone could agree on" as Mr. Wolfowitz puts it. 

<p>Now we should not be surprised at the indifference the Bush administration shows to the fact that no weapons of mass destruction have been found. Some likely knew all along that there would be none found. It was more important for these ideologues that what was started was finished. The end justifying the means. If it takes lies then so be it. If it takes collateral damage so be it. What is important to these men is that their ideas of what constitutes the United States role in the world must be implemented at all costs.

<p>What role should the peace movement have now? It should be to raise the question "Where are the weapons now!?". A great injustice has been to the American people and to the people of the world because of a handful of  powerful men. We need to loudly ask "Where are the weapons?" with the passion that preceded the Iraq invasion.
