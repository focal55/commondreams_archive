<p>Ziad Tariq Aziz showed me the only evidence that his father, the veteran Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, was still alive: a hastily written note from him, sent courtesy of the Red Cross in Baghdad. Bearing the Red Cross imprimatur and Aziz's Red Cross number - IQZ00001101- the note itself is only two sentences long, ending "I am well and thinking of you, Tariq". Across the envelope, the Red Cross has stamped the words "safe and well". 
Tariq Aziz turned himself over to the American military shortly after the fall of the capital. He hadn't rated that highly on Donald Rumsfeld's pack of cards. The only high-level Christian in Saddam's regime, Aziz may have been one of its public faces, yet it was clear that he was an increasingly isolated figure in the Ba'athist hierarchy. But, unlike the renowned Iraqi information minister, Mohammed Saeed al Sahhaf - who was interrogated and then quickly released - Aziz is now apparently being held without trial in a broiling, dusty compound at what was once Saddam international airport. Along with many fellow Iraqi political leaders and others swept up in the American dragnet, there seem to be no plans either to put him on trial or to release him. 

<p>His wife Zureida and his two sons are staying in a hotel in Amman, Jordan. A few blocks away there is a lively trade in documents purporting to come from various former ministries in Baghdad. "My cousin went into one ministry and found some government stamps just lying there," a Jordanian tells me in the hotel lobby; forging documents which implicate people in the crimes of Saddam's regime "is an easy way to make some money", he says. 

<p>In this postwar reality of claim, counter-claim and corruption, "justice" is arbitrary - and made more so by the chaos in Iraq itself. The country smolders into guerrilla warfare, and Baghdad remains a looted, threatening place where the new "provisional coalition authority" can't even get the lights to work. And yet "coalition" leaders show little sign of acknowledging the occupation's spectacular failures or the scale of opposition to it in Iraq and around the world. In a interview yesterday the head of the US administration in Iraq, Paul Bremer, asserted that: "We dominate the scene and we will ... impose our will on this country." 

<p>In such a climate, the Aziz family's campaign on behalf of their father is by necessity low-key. His sons are anxious not to upset the Jordanian authorities and extremely loath to court publicity. Their question is a simple one - "Why is Tariq Aziz being held without trial?" 

<p>Their defense of their father - that he had only been "following orders" as a senior official in the former Iraqi regime - would scarcely meet the standard set by the Nuremberg trials, nor that of the new international criminal court. But under American policy it seems unlikely that it will even get a hearing. The US has refused to sign up to the international court. In stead, it would seem, it intends to hold people in detention indefinitely, just as it is doing in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, at Bagram in Afghanistan and, it is persistently claimed, on the British-owned island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Such an affront to "justice" lacks even the most basic transparency - no one even knows how many Iraqi PoWs and other detainees are being held, just as no one knows whether any Iraqis have been sent to Guantanamo Bay. Despite repeated representations to US diplomats, Ziad Aziz told me that all enquiries had led only to that hastily scrawled note. 

<p>Last week, Jack Straw wrote in the Financial Times deploring the house arrest of the Burmese opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. He was right to do so. Nor can any direct comparison be made between a democratic opposition leader and a former minister of a dictatorship, who will have known of the large-scale human rights abuses committed under Saddam's rule. But the fact remains that Mr Aziz and many others face indefinite imprisonment without trial, in the wake of a war that, according to the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, broke the UN charter and was, in the opinion of most international lawyers, illegal. That, too, cannot be tolerated in democratic states which claim to uphold the rule of law. 

<p>The London-based barrister Abdul Haq al-Ani certainly believes so. I met him as he prepared to journey into the lawless badlands of the western Iraqi desert. Mr Ani has a touching faith in British justice. Not only was he planning to contact the Red Cross and the occupation authorities in order to give Tariq Aziz legal advice in accordance with the Geneva convention and the Human Rights Act, but he was also determined to gather evidence for criminal proceedings against US and British officials for their actions in Iraq. Mr Ani told me that if he were refused access to Aziz he would return to Britain and issue a writ for habeas corpus on the defense minister, Geoff Hoon. 

<p>This would be an interesting irony. Britain is the joint occupying power in Iraq; it is also a signatory to the international court and has instituted a human rights act. The British government has been proactive in hunting down those accused of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and even - albeit briefly - the former Chilean dictator, General Pinochet. So how will Hoon justify British behavior in Iraq? 

<p>Last year I went to Baghdad and interviewed Tariq Aziz in the now bombed-out foreign ministry. I told him that Tony Blair was not saber-rattling; that he would use force if Iraq failed to allow UN weapons inspectors back in. "We have no weapons of mass destruction", Aziz insisted. "Tell Mr Blair that he can send anyone to Iraq to see for themselves." In common with many others, I was, then, more inclined to believe Blair rather than Aziz. 

<p>And so the one-time face of the Saddam regime now languishes in a Baghdad airport compound, a victim of victors' revenge. Few Iraqis could expect much in the way of justice under the old regime, but since one of the pretexts for the war was a promise to bring justice to the benighted people of that country, Bush and Blair may soon be fingered for telling yet another lie. 

<p>Perhaps the Aziz family should not worry too much. Their father has been around long enough to have dealt with many of those, such as Donald Rumsfeld, who were only too happy to sell Iraq weapons of mass destruction when it suited them. And their father knows where the proverbial bodies are buried. It should be up to independent courts to decide whether he and other Iraqi officials know about real bodies - not US military tribunals or occupation courts, but either the international court itself or courts constituted by a democratic Iraq, free of foreign occupation. And meanwhile it is also for the courts to decide whether he is being held illegally - and whether Blair ordered an illegal war, a war that is far from over.
