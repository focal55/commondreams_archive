<p>Allegations are swirling that Karl Rove, senior political adviser to 
President George W. Bush, may have committed a felony by blowing the 
cover of a CIA operative. CIA Director George Tenet has called on the 
Justice Department to investigate but the White House said Monday that 
"President George W. Bush has no plans to ask his staff members whether 
they played a role." And what makes this story even more remarkable is 
how seriously the Bush family has viewed outing intelligence operatives 
in the past.

<p>The man at the center of this firestorm is Joseph Wilson, the retired 
U.S. diplomat who debunked the White House's key evidence that Saddam 
Hussein was rebuilding his nuclear program.

<p>Two weeks ago Democracy Now! aired Wilson's comments before a suburban 
Seattle audience that he believes Bush's closest aide, Karl Rove, told 
reporters that Wilson's wife was a CIA agent.

<p>At the forum Wilson declared, "At the end of the day, it's of keen 
interest to me to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog-marched 
out of White House in handcuffs." Wilson added, "And trust me when I use 

that name, I measure my words."

<p>Wilson told Democracy Now!, "I have reason to believe that it was the 
political office that at a minimum confirmed it and the political office 
was Karl Rove.It was a reporter who told me it was Karl Rove and that's 
as far as I want to go right now."

<p>The whole scandal began in July a week after Wilson went public in an 
op-ed piece in the New York Times saying he was the diplomat sent by the 
Bush Administration to Niger to investigate whether Saddam Hussein tried 
to buy uranium from the African country. His findings: the accusations 
were baseless.

<p>Wilson was not alone. The US ambassador to Niger, Barbro 
Owens-Kirkpatrick, knew of the allegations of uranium sales to Iraq and 
had already debunked them in her reports back to Washington. Wilson's 
conclusions also coincided with those of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of 
the US Armed Forces four-star Marine Corps General, Carlton Fulford, who 
had also researched the matter on the ground in Niger. Wilson felt he 
had authoritatively debunked the Niger rumor and "the matter was settled."

<p>But the lie refused to die. In January 2003, Bush made his famous 16 
word line in his State of the Union address: "The British government has 
learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of 
uranium from Africa."

<p>In July, soon after Wilson blew the whistle in The New York Times, the 
White House was forced to admit that the accusation should not have been 
included in the State of the Union.

<p>A few days later, conservative columnist Robert Novak wrote a column in 
which he cited "two senior administration officials" and stated that 
Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA operative dealing with weapons 
of mass destruction.

<p>In an extensive interview on Democracy Now!, Wilson said that the outing 
of his wife as an alleged CIA operative and other attempts to discredit 
him "are clearly intended to intimidate others from coming forward."

<p>But it's not just intimidation; it's a felony. Until now, a crime the 
Bush family has taken very seriously. According to Ray McGovern, a 
retired CIA analyst who worked under Bush Sr. at both the CIA and the 
White House, "The Intelligence Identities Protection Act was made 
draconian, it was made very, very specific, automatic penalties that 
would accrue to both officials and non-officials-anyone who knowingly 
disclosed the identity of a CIA agent or officer." The penalty: fines of 
up to $50,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years.

<p>Many believe the law was passed in direct response to former CIA agent 
Philip Agee's blowing the whistle on CIA dirty tricks in his book Inside 
the Company. George H.W. Bush, who was vice-president when the law was 
passed, said some of the criticism of the Agency ruined secret U.S. 
clandestine operations in foreign countries.

<p>So seriously did the Bushes take the crime of exposing CIA operatives 
that Barbara Bush, in her memoirs, accused Agee of blowing the cover of 
the CIA Station Chief in Greece, Richard Welch, who was assassinated 
outside his Athens residence in 1975. Agee sued the former first lady 
and Mrs. Bush withdrew the statement from additional printings of her 
book. Still, at a celebration marking the fiftieth anniversary of the 
CIA, the elder Bush again singled out Agee in his remarks, calling him 
"a traitor to our country."

<p>David MacMichael worked as a CIA analyst at the time the law was passed. 
He told Democracy Now!: "If former President Bush could define Philip 
Agee as a traitor for exposing the identities of serving intelligence 
officers, if his son's political advisor has done the same.it is a very 
serious felony under the current Act."

<p>(If in fact it was Karl Rove who leaked or authorized the leak to Novak, 
it won't be the first time the two have worked in tandem. According to 
Esquire, in 1992, Rove was fired from the Bush Sr. presidential campaign 
for leaking a negative story. The difference is, whoever authorized this 
leak, committed a felony.)

<p>Rather than investigating who in the administration committed this 

alleged felony, the White House spent months dodging reporters' 
questions. "I'm telling you flatly, that is not the way this White House 
operates.No one was certainly given any authority to do anything of that 
nature," declared White House spokesperson Scott McClellan, careful 
legalistic language. Neither Bush nor Ashcroft has publicly called for 
an investigation.

<p>And Vice President Dick Cheney's only public comments on Joe Wilson have 
been when questioned on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sept. 14, "I don't 
know Joe Wilson. I've never met Joe Wilson" and "I have no idea who 
hired him."

<p>Cheney's comments strain credulity.

<p>While technically he may have never met Wilson, the investigation into 
Niger was done at the request of the vice president's office. Surely, 
Mr. Cheney learned of this, if not before the request was made, then 
after, when, as the Washington Post revealed, Cheney traveled repeatedly 
to the CIA during 2002.

<p>"This is not unusual. This is unprecedented," retired CIA analyst Ray 
McGovern told Democracy Now! "The Vice President of the United States 
never during [my] 27 years came out to the CIA headquarters for a 
working visit.. this is like inviting money-changers into the temple."

<p>While Cheney may not know Wilson, there is little doubt he knows of him. 
When Cheney was helping run the Persian Gulf War, as secretary of 
defense, Wilson was one of the key players. As the acting US ambassador 
on the ground in Baghdad in the weeks leading up to the war, the White 
House consulted Wilson daily. In those weeks, he was the only open line 
of communication between Washington and Saddam Hussein. Cheney was the 
Secretary of Defense at the time and a key player in the day-to-day 
operations and intelligence gathering. Furthermore, Wilson was formally 
commended by the Bush administration for his bravery and heroism in the 
weeks leading up to the war. In that time, Wilson helped evacuate 
thousands of foreigners from Kuwait, negotiated the release of more than 
120 American hostages and sheltered nearly 800 Americans in the embassy 
compound.

<p>"Your courageous leadership during this period of great danger for 
American interests and American citizens has my admiration and respect. 
I salute, too, your skillful conduct of our tense dealings with the 
government of Iraq," President Bush wrote Wilson in a letter. "The 
courage and tenacity you have exhibited throughout this ordeal prove 
that you are the right person for the job."

<p>Wilson says that he heard from people who were at meetings chaired by 
Bush in the lead up to the Gulf War, "When people would come up with an 
idea, George Bush would often lean forward and ask them, 'What does Joe 
Wilson say about that? What does Joe Wilson think about that?' So at the 
highest level of our government there was keen interest in knowing what 
the field was saying and Dick Cheney was probably at those meetings."

<p>What's Cheney hiding? What's the White House hiding?

<p>There is a scandal brewing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that if treated 
properly by the Department of Justice and elected officials could prove 
to be one of the clearest cases of documentable criminal conduct and 
blatant lies by an administration since Watergate and the Iran-Contra 
scandal.
