<p>Old habits are hard to break.  European-Americans started doing it 400 years
ago.  Invade the territory of a darker-skinned people, although they have never 
attacked you.  Bring overwhelming military technology, leaving them little 
chance to defend themselves. When they dare to fight back, using whatever means 
they can, cry "Foul! Unfair! Savages! Terrorists!"  Blame the victim.
<p>A sadly typical example turns up in the Washington Post (April 6).  Two law 
professors write:  "British and American forces [in Iraq] find themselves under 
attack by fighters masquerading as civilians.  Some now wonder whether codes
designed to spare civilians from the ravages of war are dangerously outmoded, 
forcing coalition forces to fight with one hand tied behind their backs, while 
Iraqi forces flout the rules of warfare."

<p>Should we pity the poor forces of the "coalition" (such a civilized word), 
victims of unfair Iraqi tactics, forced to fight "with one hand tied behind 
their backs"?  I'm trying to figure out how to laugh, cry, and scream at the
same time.  Perhaps this phrase means the same thing today that it meant in 
Vietnam:  "Hey, at least we ain't nukin' 'em." 
 
<p>But I should not rush to judgment. After all, these professor are experts in
international law.  They explain that civilized nations have developed rules of 
war, to tell everyone what is fair and what is not.  I'm just having a bit of 
trouble understanding these rules.  After many hours of watching network TV 
news, here is what I have learned:  

<p>If we spend 12 years destroying a nation's anti-aircraft defenses, then drop
tons and tons of bombs on a defenseless people, that is fair.

<p>If some of them take off their uniforms and fight in civilian clothes, that is 
unfair.  

<p>If we use sanctions for 12 years to deny a nation any new military technology, 
while we  build several generations of new computer-based weapons to use 
against them, that is fair.  

<p>If they turn a school into a military base, that is unfair.  

<p>If we order our uniformed soldiers into a battle where they might be killed,
that is fair.  We call those soldiers heroes.  

<p>If they have people who wear civilian clothes and volunteer for missions where 
they will surely be killed, that is unfair.  We call those suicide bombers 
cowardly, villainous, and insane.  

<p>If they place guns next to private homes, putting civilians at risk, that is
unfair.  

<p>If we invade their country, knowing that this may very will trigger terror 
attacks in the U.S., putting thousands of U.S. civilians at risk, that is 
fair.   

<p>So now I get it.  The basic principle that determines the rules of war is 
crystal clear.  If we do it, it is fair and within rules of war.  If the Iraqis 
do it, it is unfair and violates the rules of war.  By definition.  

<p>The British figured out this principle back in 1776, when their neatly arrayed, 
technologically superior redcoats were bedeviled by colonists, who used tactics 
they had learned from the Indians.  

<p>Los Angeles Times columnist Robert Scheer reminds us (April 1):  "How easy to 
forget that our own war for independence was largely fought by 'irregulars' 
condemned as terrorists by the British because they would snipe from behind 
scattered trees rather than fight from the tight parade formations that were
the civilized form of warfare in those days. Ours is a long history of covert 
actions, political assassinations, special ops, anti-democratic coups and dirty 
tricks that are, even today, being used in Iraq. And we claim that the ends of 
U.S. policy are so noble that even clearly illegal means, such as a preemptive 
invasion, are justified."  

<p>The ends justify the means.  And our ends are so noble.  We are so civilized, 
so far superior to the life of savagery our enemy lives.  That is why, if we do 
it, it is fair. If they do it, it is unfair.  By definition, blame falls on the 
victim.  

<p>Liberal commentators have come up with a more subtle way to blame the victim
while proclaiming our noble motives.  They tell us that the real problem for
Iraqis is not U.S. bombs falling on them, but their own reluctance to embrace 
the freedom we offer them so generously.  

<p>"Liberation Brings Iraqis Freedom to Choose, Fail," says a headline in the 
Denver Post (April 6).  The article explains that "before the war, Iraq's 
totalitarian system took care of practically everything."  Now the invading 
armies are forcing them to learn to think for themselves, as if they don't know 
how and will not know until we teach them.  

<p>"You guys are responsible for your own actions," a U.S. officer tells 
Iraqis. "That's what freedom is about."  The reporter adds:  "The locals looked 
at him, seemingly aghast.  Helping instill self-rule will be a complicated 
challenge for western government and nongovernment aid and reconstruction 
groups."  

<p>They may fail to meet the challenge.  The article notes that westerners are 
heading in to rebuild Iraq "without Arabic-speaking staffers," which may make 
it tough for the Iraqis' free choices to get heard and translated into action.  
The article also mentions in passing the Iraqis' growing rage as the death toll 
mounts.  But hey, as the headline points out, the glory of our system is that 
everyone is free to fail.

<p>Los Angeles Times columnist John Balzar (April 6) also asks: "Will the Seeds of 
Freedom Take Root in the Mideast's Soil?"  He just wants the Arabs to 
understand us Americans.  We are romantics, sentimental and often naive, he 
tells them.  "Our president is such a man, and he has dared to proclaim that
war will liberate an oppressed people in Iraq."  Since we are a democracy, we 
have the right to dissent, and many of us "see misguided imperialist motives by 
our leaders, and a forfeiture of morality."  

<p>So is our president a sentimental romantic or an immoral imperialist? Balzar's 
rather bizarre argument is that the Arabs themselves, not Bush and his 
advisors, will determine the answer.  He tells Arabs that they must decide 
whether to "take a chance on Bush's promise of opportunity or decide on 
confrontation, or seek some other path.  Whichever view prevails depends on 
you."  The Arabs, not the White House or the Pentagon, will determine U.S. 
policy and "the order of this coming new world."  If we turn out to be 
imperialists, it is the Arabs' own fault!    

<p>Yet Balzar immediately tells the Arabs that in fact the choice has already been 
made for them.  We are obviously liberators and not conquerors, he implies, 
precisely because we are giving them the freedom to determine the future: "You 
are empowered.  Self-determination? This is no longer something for the future. 
We call it voting with your feet. Drink it in. This is what democracy tastes
like."  The sooner they welcome their conquerors, the sooner they will be just 
like us.  They will even have the right to dissent - though not, apparently, to 
dissent from being just like us.   

<p>Four centuries ago, the first English invaders came to these shores with the
same vision of innocent righteousness.   They were sure they were here to do
God's will.  So how could they not be righteous and innocent?  They were 
inviting the Indians to receive the Lord's salvation.  If the Indians declined -  if they chose deceitful terror over enlightened civilization and had to be 
exterminated - whose fault was that?  Surely their own. 
 
<p>Blaming the victim is a very old game here in America.  Sadly, much of our 
public swallows it whole.  And there is no end of it in sight.  The only 
question is which victims we will be blaming next.
