<p>The occupation of Iraq has turned into the reckless blunder that the White 
House's critics warned about prior to the U.S. attack in March. <p>The military 
victory over the Iraqi army was never in doubt. What mattered was the aftermath, 
and the management of a fractious and violent country after its army was defeated 
and its government dismantled and jailed. <p>Now we're stuck in what national 
security specialists call an "asymmetric war," unable to defeat the enemy but 
unable to leave. Diligent reporters and researchers have only just revealed how 
unprepared the U.S. government was for managing Iraq, and how deluded Pentagon 
and White House officials were about how events might unfold there. Now we know 
that our leaders simply ignored their intelligence experts. <p>Iraq was meant 
to be a test case of the concept known among academics and professionals as the 
Revolution in Military Affairs, or RMA, also known in political circles as defense 
transformation. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is a true believer in defense 
transformation. <p>The chief benefits of the RMA, according to its proponents, 
are "more bang for the buck," seamless interservice integration, "smarter" weapons 
that allow pinpoint-targeting accuracy, and smaller, faster and more deadly combat 
units. <p>This is why the U.S. military went into Iraq with fewer forces than 
commanders recommended, and why the pace of the war was so fast that routine military 
safeguards were neglected. Rumsfeld and his close advisers were determined to 
demonstrate to the military that the ideas at the core of the RMA were feasible 
in real combat. <p>But this also explains why the military was so unprepared for 
the "real" war, the bloody conflict we're in now. Combat troops trained to fight 
using the most deadly high-tech weapons are not ready for urban policework or 
peacekeeping among civilians, let alone guerrilla warfare. Earlier this year, 
the Pentagon announced that it was closing the U.S. Army's Peacekeeping Institute, 
a decision that was reversed in September because of the situation in Iraq. <p>Military 
officers have long known from experience that the path to promotion is not through 
peacekeeping, but through enthusiasm for the ideas of the high-tech RMA. Thus 
the U.S. military is caught in a terrible dilemma. Most of our soldiers are ignorant 
about Iraq and its politics, and only a few are able to speak the language of 
the people they are there to protect. Our troops have the wrong tools and the 
wrong training for their current mission. They have no visible strategy for success. 
It's not even clear that more troops with the same training would turn things 
around. <p>White House obfuscation about the trap we're caught in only makes things 
worse. The administration insists we're fighting the last remnants of diehard 
Saddam Hussein loyalists and a few foreign jihadists. <p>But Middle Eastern expert 
Ahmed Hashim, a colonel in the U.S. Army, has identified numerous Iraqi resistance 
factions, mostly disconnected from each other and diverse in their skills and 
their goals. "With so many motives and goals, there cannot be a single strategy 
to stabilize this situation, and a military solution alone will never work," wrote 
Hashim. <p>What's happening is a nightmare come true: multiple sources of guerrilla 
resisters who are attacking our troops and other targets, and getting better at 
it because they're learning our weaknesses and responses. Our staggering arsenal 
of high-tech weapons will be of little use in such circumstances. Our soldiers 
are brave and dedicated, but they're sitting ducks. Yet the president insists 
we won't leave. No one is likely to volunteer to help us. <p>This is producing 
a depressing déj vu. Jeanne Kirkpatrick, the former Reagan administration official 
and neoconservative hawk, said in 1979 that Vietnam should have "taught us the 
dangers of trying to be the world's midwife to democracy when the birth is scheduled 
to take place under conditions of guerrilla war." <p>Evidently, we didn't learn. 
And now we're stuck in quicksand once again. <p><I>Chapman is director of The
