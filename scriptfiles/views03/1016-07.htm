<p>ON Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States announced that it will decide whether the phrase "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance violates the constitutional separation of church and state. The attention that has already been paid to this question, and that will undoubtedly be devoted to it when the Supreme Court hears oral argument later this year and then issues a ruling sometime next year, is out of all proportion to the legal complexity of the case. Politically and emotionally, the issue triggers strong reactions. As a legal matter, however, the requirement that schoolchildren recite the words "under God" at the beginning of each school day clearly violates the First Amendment. 

<p>The first clause of the First Amendment provides that Congress can make no law respecting an establishment of religion. This so-called Establishment Clause, which also applies to states, has been interpreted to mean that the government must be neutral where religion is concerned. The neutrality requirement means two things: first, that the government may not prefer one religion (or group of religions) to another, and second, that the government may not prefer religion in general to nonreligion. In other words, the government cannot favor Christians over Muslims (or vice versa), nor can it favor monotheists to polytheists, nor can it favor religious citizens generally over nonreligious citizens. 

<p>As the country has become increasingly heterogeneous, the significance of the neutrality requirement has become increasingly important. Whereas, at the time the nation was created, more than 90 percent of the population was Christian, today's population is dramatically more diverse. There are literally hundreds of recognized churches in the United States today. Americans practice traditional faiths born in the Near East, but also faiths rooted in the far East, in African tribal religions, and in Latin American voodoo. Others pick and choose from various traditions, and still others practice no religion at all. The Establishment Clause commands that in the face of this profound religious diversity, the state itself must remain steadfastly neutral. 

<p>With Justice Antonin Scalia having already recused himself from consideration of the case (presumably because he has given public speeches defending the legality of the phrase "under God"), Justice Sandra Day O'Connor may well provide the critical vote. O'Connor has been perhaps the leading architect of contemporary Establishment Clause doctrine. In the case of Lynch v. Donnelly, which involved a challenge to the government's display of a creche, O'Connor explained that the neutrality requirement means more than the simple proposition that the government cannot favor religious citizens. It also means that the government may not do things that cause members of the nondominant faith to perceive that they are political outsiders. 

<p>It is this very neutrality principle that was responsible for the Supreme Court's decision three years ago in the Santa Fe case. The Court held that the Santa Fe School District near Houston could not begin football games with school-sponsored prayer. The reason is that such prayers would cause nonreligious students (or students whose religion differed from that of the majority) to perceive that they were outsiders. 

<p>The Santa Fe case provoked a predictable hue and cry. Many people insisted that the Declaration of Independence refers to God and that the framers of the Constitution were themselves religious. Those observations are correct, but beside the point, for the nation has lived up to its promise of being a nation that welcomes all immigrants, based not on their religious beliefs, but instead on their commitment to democratic political values. When the Pledge of Allegiance refers to "one nation," that is the nation that it means. 

<p>Indeed, the phrase "under God" was not a part of the original Pledge of Allegiance; rather it was added in 1954, in the midst of the so-called Red Scare, to distinguish between the godless communists, and the God-fearing Americans. Since the end of that hysterical era, we have learned, of course, that not all communists are actually godless, and, perhaps more importantly, that not all good Americans are indeed God-fearing. 


<p>By insisting that schoolchildren recite the "under God" language, the government endorses the message that belief in God is a requirement of being an American, or at least a good American. That message is false, and it is a message that the Constitution prohibits the government from conveying.
