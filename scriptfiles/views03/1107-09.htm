<p>Bring Halliburton home. Cancel the contracts. Ditch the deals. Rip up the rules. 
Those are just a few of the suggestions for slogans that could help unify the 
growing movement against the occupation of Iraq. So far, activist debates have 
focused on whether the demand should be for a complete withdrawal of troops, or 
for the United States to cede power to the United Nations. 
<p>But the "troops 
out" debate overlooks an important fact. If every last soldier pulled out of the 
Gulf tomorrow and a sovereign government came to power, Iraq would still be occupied: 
by laws written in the interest of another country; by foreign corporations controlling 
its essential services; by 70% unemployment sparked by public sector layoffs. 
<p>Any movement serious about Iraqi self-determination must call not only for 
an end to Iraq's military occupation, but to its economic colonization as well. 
That means reversing the shock therapy reforms that US occupation chief Paul Bremer 
has fraudulently passed off as "reconstruction", and canceling all privatization 
contracts that are flowing from these reforms. 
<p>How can such an ambitious goal 
be achieved? Easy: by showing that Bremer's reforms were illegal to begin with. 
They clearly violate the international convention governing the behavior of occupying 
forces, the Hague regulations of 1907 (the companion to the 1949 Geneva conventions, 
both ratified by the United States), as well as the US army's own code of war. 
<p>The Hague regulations state that an occupying power must respect "unless absolutely 
prevented, the laws in force in the country". The coalition provisional authority 
has shredded that simple rule with gleeful defiance. Iraq's constitution outlaws 
the privatization of key state assets, and it bars foreigners from owning Iraqi 
firms. No plausible argument can be made that the CPA was "absolutely prevented" 
from respecting those laws, and yet two months ago, the CPA overturned them unilaterally. 
<p>On September 19, Bremer enacted the now infamous Order 39. It announced that 
200 Iraqi state companies would be privatized; decreed that foreign firms can 
retain 100% ownership of Iraqi banks, mines and factories; and allowed these firms 
to move 100% of their profits out of Iraq. The Economist declared the new rules 
a "capitalist dream". 
<p>Order 39 violated the Hague regulations in other ways 
as well. The convention states that occupying powers "shall be regarded only as 
administrator and usufructuary of public buildings, real estate, forests and agricultural 
estates belonging to the hostile state, and situated in the occupied country. 
It must safeguard the capital of these properties, and administer them in accordance 
with the rules of usufruct." 
<p>Bouvier's Law Dictionary defines "usufruct" (possibly 
the ugliest word in the English language) as an arrangement that grants one party 
the right to use and derive benefit from another's property "without altering 
the substance of the thing". Put more simply, if you are a housesitter, you can 
eat the food in the fridge, but you can't sell the house and turn it into condos. 
And yet that is just what Bremer is doing: what could more substantially alter 
"the substance" of a public asset than to turn it into a private one? 
<p>In case 
the CPA was still unclear on this detail, the US army's Law of Land Warfare states 
that "the occupant does not have the right of sale or unqualified use of [non-military] 
property". This is pretty straightforward: bombing something does not give you 
the right to sell it. There is every indication that the CPA is well aware of 
the lawlessness of its privatization scheme. In a leaked memo written on March 
26, the British attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, warned Tony Blair that "the 
imposition of major structural economic reforms would not be authorized by international 
law". 
<p>So far, most of the controversy surrounding Iraq's reconstruction has 
focused on the waste and corruption in the awarding of contracts. This badly misses 
the scope of the violation: even if the sell-off of Iraq were conducted with full 
transparency and open bidding, it would still be illegal for the simple reason 
that Iraq is not America's to sell. 
<p>The security council's recognition of the 
United States' and Britain's occupation authority provides no legal cover. The 
UN resolution passed in May specifically required the occupying powers to "comply 
fully with their obligations under international law including in particular the 
Geneva conventions of 1949 and the Hague regulations of 1907". 
<p>According to 
a growing number of international legal experts, that means that if the next Iraqi 
government decides it doesn't want to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Bechtel 
and Halliburton, it will have powerful legal grounds to renationalize assets that 
were privatized under CPA edicts. 
<p>Juliet Blanch, global head of energy and 
international arbitration for the huge international law firm Norton Rose, says 
that because Bremer's reforms directly contradict Iraq's constitution, they are 
"in breach of international law and are likely not enforceable". Blanch argues 
that the CPA "has no authority or ability to sign those [privatization] contracts", 
and that a sovereign Iraqi government would have "quite a serious argument for 
renationalization without paying compensation". Firms facing this type of expropriation 
would, according to Blanch, have "no legal remedy". 
<p>The only way out for the 
administration is to make sure that Iraq's next government is anything but sovereign. 
It must be pliant enough to ratify the CPA's illegal laws, which will then be 
celebrated as the happy marriage of free markets and free people. Once that happens, 
it will be too late: the contracts will be locked in, the deals done and the occupation 
of Iraq permanent. 
<p>Which is why anti-war forces must use this fast-closing 
window to demand that the next Iraqi government be free from the shackles of these 
reforms. It's too late to stop the war, but it's not too late to deny Iraq's invaders 
the myriad economic prizes they went to war to collect in the first place. 
<p>It's 
not too late to cancel the contracts and ditch the deals.
