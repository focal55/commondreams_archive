<p>I've always been suspicious of flag wavers since the time about 30 years ago a fellow Wisconsin Army National Guard member was fired because he had to take two weeks off at a busy time of the year to attend annual training with his unit. 

<p>The citizen soldier worked for one of those national franchises that display their "patriotism" by flying a huge American flag in front of their business. Apparently flying a big flag was enough of a commitment to America's military; giving an employee a couple of weeks off to train was going too far. Heaven forbid it might actually cost a couple of bucks. 

<p>The feds, of course, quickly reminded the owners that it's illegal to fire people for their commitment to the nation's military and the Guardsman was given his job back. He quickly found work with another company, though - one that didn't fly a huge flag, but stood by its military people. 

<p>I remember the irony of it all because it was back during the Vietnam War days when this newspaper was one of the leading critics of that war, constantly editorializing that we needed to pull out and let the Vietnamese determine their own destiny. Many of the "professional" patriots during those days harangued us with letters and phone calls, questioning our loyalty to America and insisting that our editorials "proved" we were "traitors" to the United States. 

<p>Meanwhile, those traitors at The Capital Times Co. not only gave those of us in the Guard or Reserves the time off, they paid our full salaries besides. I didn't even have an obligation, having served my two years of active duty and two years in reserves long before, but I got the time off and my pay nevertheless. 

<p>I tell this not to pat The Capital Times Co. on the back, but to point out that there's a lot more to patriotism than meets the eye. 

<p>For example, I got a charge out of that support-our-troops demonstration in Monona the other day where several of the participants insisted that those who demonstrate against the war are unpatriotic. The truth is there may actually be a heckuva lot more patriotic folks demonstrating against the war than in some of the pro-war demonstrations. 

<p>Demonstrating for a cause, after all, is quite American. And that goes for both the anti- and pro-war demonstrations. The founders of this nation expected the citizens to make their views known in many different ways. 

<p>My personal belief is that this war, like the one in Vietnam all those years ago, is a serious mistake and regardless of its outcome will do us more harm in the end than good. The world had a jump on containing Saddam and we could have isolated him and caused his eventual downfall by other means than all-out war. 

<p>Meanwhile, we've unleashed a rat's nest of anti-American sentiment and put at peril innocent U.S. citizens around the world for years and years to come. And, as bad, we're spending billions of dollars that could have gone instead to help solve the many problems we have here at home - cash-starved schools, old folks who can't afford to pay for their drugs, families and children without health insurance, the long-term health of Social Security, to name a few. 

<p>Does that mean that I don't support our troops? Of course not. Now that they've been sent to battle, placed in harm's way, and are bravely doing the job they've been asked to do, they need every bit of help this nation can give them to end this thing as quickly as possible. 

<p>It will never change my mind, though, that their commander-in-chief and his entourage have made a bad mistake.
