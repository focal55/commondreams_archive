<p>Sunday’s Washington Post carries an editorial that epitomizes the rhetorical trap facing the Democrats on foreign policy in 2004:
<p>
<blockquote><i>“Polls show that the presidential pack is tacking toward the views of early primary voters, a majority of whom opposed the war in Iraq. The question is whether the eventual Democratic platform will be one that a majority of the country can support.”</i></blockquote>
<p>In framing the question first as being about polls and second as being about opposition to the war in Iraq, the Post is doing Democrats a major disservice. The question patriotic progressives should be asking is whether or not they support the set of national interests that have led every president since Roosevelt, both Democrat and Republican, to intervene in the energy-rich sands of the greater Middle East. As long as Democrats accept without question the economic engine that needs cheap fossil fuels but benefits only the top 20% of Americans, the US will constantly face the issue of protecting our interests in that region.

<p>In contrast, the Post highlights a recently released national security statement by the centrist Progressive Policy Institute entitled, “Progressive Internationalism: A Democratic National Security Strategy” that illustrates just how far the Party has to go. The paper is little more than an extended Democracy Corps “message” memo with half the document dedicated to criticizing Bush and rhetorically associating their strategy with such Democratic titans as Roosevelt, Truman, and Wilson, while assuring the swing voter that Democrats are more than willing to use force. After the spin, what remains is not a strategy but simply a list of five issues—democracy building, counter-terrorism, homeland defense, military transformation, multilateralism, and global trade—that play well in the polls and that benefit the right DLC special interests. 
<p>Unfortunately, playing to the polls and courting special interests will not make America safe or prosperous and rings as hollow as Al Gore’s claim to have invented the Internet. At this point in the American Experiment, self-respecting Americans can smell tactical messaging—and when they do, they tend run in the opposite direction. Such an implicit insult to the American voter risks deepening already record levels of voter alienation and the cynical statement that getting elected is more important than security and prosperity will drive voters to the right. 
<p>Certainly, the stakes are high. The Bush Administration is reaping the bitter harvest of an ideology detached from reality and they are vulnerable simply because their policies are failing, not because the Democrats have something better on offer. Simply by not being Republicans are the Democrats poised to take the White House. But neo-con failure comes in two categories: incompetent policy-level management and the irrational promotion of a dysfunctional grand strategy. To the extent that Democrats seek to profit from the failed policy-level efforts of the Bush Administration and do not address the deeper underlying dysfunction between our economic engine and our strategic posture—Americans will reject Democratic leadership. Maybe not in 2004, but as our unsustainable economic engine puts more and more demands on our national security architecture, and crises become more numerous and more severe, Democrats will see first a Republican super-majority in 2006 and then the loss of the White House in 2008. That is, if such a short-sighted strategy does not trigger both nightmare scenarios in 2004.
<p>I would define Bush Lite as the unquestioning acceptance of the current set of national interests, the inability to see beyond short-term symptomatic threats, and the attempt to make the argument, “my marginal economic stimulus and war on terrorism is better than Bush’s.” In other words, it is the inability to recognize and admit that American grand strategy, a dinosaur hatched in the 1940’s, is now so out of date that further tweaking is impossible. A new correlation of means to ends is necessary and Americans can sense it.
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, the major drivers of our national security policy have been the requirements of our economic engine. That engine is comprised of suburban consumption, income taxes & economic subsidies, and cheap fossil fuels. All three elements are now obsolete—indeed, all three are pathologically dysfunctional. Suburban sprawl is destroying our communities, families, and natural environment. Sprawl is so incapable of meeting our future needs that all of Southern California is now engaged in a long-term planning process to transform today’s sprawl using new urbanist “smart growth” planning to accommodate the estimated six million more residents coming to the region in the next twenty years—300,000 each year. Income taxes and industrial subsidies are mocking our free market economic principles by penalizing labor and making it cheaper for corporations to seek protection and relief in Congress than to compete honestly in the market. Innovation and adaptation are stifled, and corruption becomes rife. In terms of energy, between the war in Iraq and the Northeast blackout, it is clear that our dependence on fossil fuels is a deadly addiction. After only 7 months of operations, the cost of the Iraq war is now equivalent to a $1.98/gallon gasoline tax.
<p>But the real extent of the unsustainability is even greater. By penalizing American labor and subsidizing fossil fuels and raw materials, our system is maintaining a massive barrier to global economic expansion, expansion America desperately needs. Energy and material intensity per unit of US gross domestic product is out of reach for five billion people in the developing world. Even if we become effective at eliminating the worst of global poverty—and half the world population lives on less than $2/day—our global energy market is incapable of meeting additional rising demand so long as our economies are run on fossil fuels. If the Chinese achieved our lifestyle they would be consuming 118% of global energy production. With mounting instability in energy producing regions, growth in production capacity cannot even meet existing long-term demand, jacking up prices. With higher prices comes non-economic competition for access to supply, seen by increased US military presence in energy producing regions, further destabilizing the market. Even if producing countries are able to invest the $1 trillion in upstream production infrastructure necessary over the next 10 years, climate change due to fossil fuel emissions will drastically destabilize the global economy, changing ocean currents, agricultural production regions, and triggering massive population displacement.
<p>But even more difficult to overcome is the $44 trillion fiscal imbalance facing the US government. As entitlement liabilities become sovereign debt over the next 15 years, Federal borrowing will sponge up global capital, spiking interest rates and suffocating economic growth at home and abroad.
<p>These converging scenarios are not like President Bush’s cooked intelligence on Iraq. Rather, they are sober, realistic, long-term implications of our current socio-economic development path. Before we get hit by the full force of these global calamities, regional crises, attacks, and market failures will emerge, magnify, and accelerate. If our Democratic Party does not get its head out of the sand and first triage the symptoms and then transform the underlying dysfunctional system—all the while securing the fully informed consent of Americans and our global partners—the American experiment of democracy and free-market capitalism could end. 
<p>But there is no need. An alternative grand strategy can be assembled and implemented, powered by innovation and renewal: adopting sustainable land use policies, shifting to waste taxes and subsidy-free markets, and establishing a renewable energy system. The resulting 20-30 year, self-reinforcing, market-driven economic boom would generate full-employment, rapidly reduce energy and material intensity while increasing prosperity, and fundamentally re-orient the set of American national interests abroad. America could then re-unite our most cherished principles with our foreign policy. Only this will decisively “drain the swamp” of the poverty and humiliation that fuel the rage and fear of extremism, the threat Bush places at the center of his foreign policy agenda.

<p>It is all up to us Democrats. If we can accept that the time has come for integrated, intelligent change, the answers that will lead to lasting prosperity and security are readily available. If this happens, there is a legitimate comparison to FDR—2004 can be like 1932. The world-changing stock market crash of 1929 happened under Republican President Hoover, but it was not until FDR was elected that America was able to re-invent itself. While his Keynesian policies would be out of date in today’s circumstances, Roosevelt’s willingness to conceive of and steward America towards a new economic engine and a new global order are exactly the tasks confronting America today. Today’s Democratic Party must look beyond the temptations of Bush Lite, steward the nation towards a new grand strategy, and in doing so, restore our endangered American Experiment.
