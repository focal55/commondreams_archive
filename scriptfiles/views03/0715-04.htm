<p>There cannot be anyone who now genuinely believes that Iraq posed a threat to Britain or America when UK and US troops invaded the country. Yet that is what we were told at the time: Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program was so dangerous that military force was the only way to stop it. 
<p>The charge now being laid at Tony Blair's door is not that he knowingly lied to the Commons and the public - an exaggeration he can easily deny. It is that he dragged Britain into a war under what, it is now clear, was a pretence. That he still sticks to the claim in his foreword to the September dossier that the threat from Iraq "is serious and current" tells you as much about his judgment and prejudices as his sincerity. 

<p>Spurred on by George Bush, his mind appeared to have been made up. Diplomatic shenanigans at the UN were a sideshow, useful but not really necessary, certainly not as far as the attorney-general's view of international law was concerned. 

<p>Blair might have told himself that it was inconceivable for Britain not to go to war. But there still had to be a pretext. Thus the government for months applied pressure on the intelligence agencies to come up with a dossier on Iraq's banned weapons . 

<p>As Sir John Stanley, former Conservative minister and member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has said, never before has Britain gone to war "specifically on the strength of intelligence assessments". The intelligence and security services were horrified by the prospect but appear to have persuaded themselves they had no choice. 

<p>Intelligence, as former chairmen of Whitehall's joint intelligence committee (JIC) have pointed out, is not evidence. Raw intelligence is often no more than assertions made by informants. These are turned into "assessments" by officials working for the JIC. They are based on judgments, subjective at the best of times, even more so when you have No 10 breathing down your neck. 

<p>There is no audit trail for this kind of thing and it is hard to see how even the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, which meets in private (and whose forthcoming report on the saga both the government and the intelligence community set great store by) will be able to discover how much pressure the government put on the JIC to sex up the dossier, and how much the spooks did it themselves. 

<p>The wording is vaguer in some parts than ministers would have liked, but much stronger in others, notably over Blair's claim in the foreword that the dossier "discloses" that Saddam's military planning allowed some WMD "to be ready" within 45 minutes of an order to use them. 

<p>Contrast this with the Ministry of Defense document, Operations in Iraq, First Reflections, published last week. It says: "Very little was known about how [Iraqi forces] planned to oppose the coalition or whether they had the will to fight." The MoD adds that it was judged the regime might "possibly" use WMD "if it could make the capabilities available for operational use". 

<p>MI6, we now know, included the phrase "there is intelligence that Iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from Africa". When the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency discovered the claim was based on forged documents, Jack Straw insisted that MI6 had "separate" sources to back up the claim. Yet he was honest enough to tell the Commons in early June that, "until we investigate properly," ministers will not be in a position to say whether that intelligence was "correct". 

<p>What seems quite clear - and it is difficult to find anyone to gainsay it - is that intelligence assessments were hardened up to bolster the case for war. 

<p>Lewis Moonie, the former Defense minister who lost his job in the recent reshuffle, gave the game away yesterday: "People seem to equate spin with lying. It is not. What we are talking about here is trying to put the best gloss on your case to ensure people accept it." 

<p>Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense secretary, further undermined the government's case last week when he told a Senate committee that America and Britain did not invade "because we had discovered dramatic new evidence of Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass murder". The US acted because it saw "existing evidence in a new light, through the prism of our experience on September 11". 

<p>Ministers cannot now back away saying what they actually meant by WMD were bits of old machinery or "programs" found in documents. The whole point of the dossier was to convince MPs to vote for war to counter an urgent threat and for the public to support them. We have a right to know from an independent inquiry whether we went to war on false pretences. The onus is now on the government and their agents to show we did not.
