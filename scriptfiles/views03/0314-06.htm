<p>Every human being has the right to clean water. In the United States, 
water has long been considered a vital resource and thus managed in the public 
interest by local governments accountable to their constituents.
<P>The mission of a public water system is simple: Deliver safe, clean and 
affordable water to you and your family. Public works projects funded and 
built our existing water infrastructure, which has served us well during the 
last century. But our water infrastructure is beginning to show signs of age. 
Pollution, decaying pipes, depleted aquifers and other problems pose real 
threats to the U.S. water supply and communities across the nation are looking 
for ways to bring water systems up to safe and modern standards.
<P>Privatizing water systems, however, is not the answer. Private companies, 
seeking to extract profits from municipal water systems, dangle lofty promises 
in order to gain control of local water systems. Corporations want people to 
believe that only they can efficiently manage water systems.
<P>They seek monopoly contracts to run water systems for generations, or to 
expand the outright corporate ownership of water supplies and infrastructure.
<P>Yet, from Atlanta to the United Kingdom to Huber Heights, Ohio, private 
water providers have charged higher rates, deteriorated water quality and 
failed to make assured investments. In fact, privatization failed so miserably 
in Atlanta that the city ousted United Water, only four years into a 20-year 
contract. Four years of broken promises and managerial debacles was more than 
enough.
<P>Residents in many California communities are increasingly concerned with 
local water systems falling into the hands of a distant corporation. In 
Stockton, where city officials recently voted to privatize the public water 
system, citizens are responding by going door-to-door to collect signatures in 
an effort to nullify the City Council's decision.
<P>I strongly believe that public control and public administration of the 
public's water supply is the only way to guarantee the universal human right 
of access to clean water. A grassroots movement of people is working to 
protect water from privatization by offering many alternative solutions to 
solve the global water crisis. Direct citizen participation should be 
encouraged when basic services such as water are being discussed. I hope that 
at the World Water Forum, which begins Sunday in Kyoto, Japan, this 
international movement of people will be heard.
