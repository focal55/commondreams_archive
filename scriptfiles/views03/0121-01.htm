<p>It would require an extremely complex calculation to forge an argument that Gary Hart can overcome the reporters, campaign fund-raisers and managers that vet potential presidential candidates, win the Democratic nomination that was denied him in 1984 and 1988, and go on to defeat George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election.

<p>But Hart should certainly be encouraged to mount a campaign for the Democratic nomination next year - if only because the contest needs some adult supervision.

<p>Appearing on ABC&#039;s &#034;This Week&#034; with George Stephanopoulos the other day, the former senator from Colorado cut like a hot knife through the buttery debates of the moment.

<p>Hart was staggeringly strong on the subject of terrorism threats and how U.S. attack on Iraq will increase them. To wit:

<p>Hart dismissed the Bush administration&#039;s approach to homeland security as the comic endeavor that it is - and he did so with the authority that comes from having co-chaired the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century, which produced a 1999 report that predicted a terrorist attack along the lines of the 9-11 hits on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

<p>Hart made the case that a U.S. attack on Iraq would dramatically increase the likelihood of new terrorist assaults on Americans at home and abroad. The former member of the Senate armed services and intelligence committees echoed the warning he has delivered for months that the United States &#034;is not prepared for the inevitable retaliatory attacks on this country that will occur when we invade Iraq.&#034;

<p>Hart, a highly regarded member of the Council on Foreign Relations, flatly rejected Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld&#039;s suggestion that terrorist groups already have plenty of inspiration to attack the United States and will not be further motivated by a war with Iraq. While most political players are cautious about contradicting Rumsfeld&#039;s seat-of-the-pants prognosticating, Hart said the defense secretary was simply &#034;wrong.&#034;

<p>Hart&#039;s appearance on &#034;This Week&#034; was a masterful performance by a senior statesman. He dismissed the absurd parameters of the current debate and pushed the dialogue further - and deeper - than it has ever gotten in Congress.

<p>Compared with the Democrats who are currently seeking the party&#039;s nomination, there was no competition. Hart was so obviously better informed, more confident and more capable of expressing opposition to the Bush White House that it was not just embarrassing, but downright revolting to think of a Dick Gephardt or a Joe Lieberman being taken more seriously as a potential nominee.

<p>This is not to suggest that Hart would be the best Democratic nominee in 2004. He&#039;s got plenty of flaws as an individual and as a leader on issues of consequence to the nation. And there are other potential candidates for the nomination - House Progressive Caucus Chairman Dennis Kucinich and Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, among them - who would bring insight, depth and a flair for opposition to the contest.

<p>Additionally, at least one of the announced candidates, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, is starting to make an impression with his blunt critique of the Bush administration&#039;s plans for tax cuts and war with Iraq.

<p>But the prospect of a Hart candidacy remains appealing. When the former senator tours Iowa in coming days, he will draw crowds of people who want to hear what he has to say. That&#039;s because, at this point at least, he is saying more of consequence than anyone else who is pondering a presidential bid - including the current occupant of the Oval Office.<p align="center">Copyright 2003 The Capital Times</p>
