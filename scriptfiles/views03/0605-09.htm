<p>We already knew that President Bush's latest tax cuts were half-and-half unfair and a fraud. Now, as the details come out, they turn out to have been outright cruel as well, pointedly stiffing poor families. 

<p>The cuts were a fraud because, billed as coming in under the $350 billion ceiling that Republican moderates in the Senate had insisted on, the 10-year package probably will cost the Treasury more like $800 billion, costlier even than the cut Bush first proposed. 

<p>The lower figure was achieved only by enacting a series of sunset dates for the tax cuts, but nobody in Washington expects the cuts to expire. 

<p>Certainly they won't be allowed to if Bush and the Republican Congress are re-elected. The president has made it plain that he's not through with tax-cutting yet, and tax cuts have become the virtual raison d'etre of the GOP. 

<p>And the cuts were unfair because, just like Bush's first two years ago, by far and away the larger part of the benefits go to upper-income households. 

<p>Computer modeling reported by Citizens for Tax Justice finds that two-thirds of the benefits will go to the best-off 10 percent of households. The bottom 60 percent will get just 8.6 percent of the benefits. 

<p>The Richie Richs in the top 1 percent of incomes will be $103,899 to the good over the next four years — as a group, pocketing 39 percent of the swag. And their share goes up to 52 percent when the capital-gains and dividend cuts kick in fully. 

<p>But it gets worse. 

<p>Combing the fine print, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that working families roughly in the $10,000 to $26,000 a year income range had been aced out of the $400 increase in the tax exemption for children. The Senate version had arranged benefits for that category, but they were dropped in conference with the House. 

<p>That strands some 9.2 million families — including about a fourth of all children under age 17. 

<p>And now the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center finds that cuts also skip 5 million taxpayers in the lowest income bracket who have no children and some 2.5 million single parents with children over 16 in the two lowest brackets. Some pay as much a $5,200 a year in income taxes. 

<p>These low-earning, working households were thrown overboard specifically to save Bush's pet tax cut — the cut in the dividend taxes that mainly nick the well off. 

<p>The tax cuts were pitched as being needed to prod the becalmed economy and thus generate jobs, but that's nonsense. If you want to goose the economy, you get money to the people who need it most and will spend it right away, not to the well heeled who tend just to squirrel it away. If tax cuts equaled jobs, we'd have a worker shortage by now, but since Bush's even larger 2001 cuts, we've lost 1.5 million jobs. 

<p>The real point of these cuts is not economic but social. They are meant to create federal budget deficits so horrendous that they seem to make the right-wing case for unloading social programs, privatizing Social Security and converting Medicare to a voucher system for private insurance. 

<p>When the right talked hopefully about "defunding government," the idea played poorly with voters. But that's just what Bush is doing under another label. This is political bait-and-switch and, so far, we're buying.
