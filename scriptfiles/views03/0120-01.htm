<p> When Martin Luther King, Jr. died nearly 35 years ago, the American church mourned deeply as the voice of one of its most articulate children fell silent, as the vision of one of its true prophets went dark. But much of that same church &#151; especially, but not solely, its white members &#151; also breathed a collective sigh of relief. Prophetic voices seldom sit easily with those in the pews (or the pulpits) on Sunday morning. And King was no exception. His dream was &#151; and remains &#151; fringed with prophetic fury.</p>

<p>We have certainly done some of the needed work on race. Not nearly all of it, but enough to ease our consciences so that we celebrate "the dream" with an ironic nostalgia. It's a nostalgia that invites us &#151; especially those of us who are white or middle to upper class &#151; to remember how far "we've" come, but doesn't dare assail us for how slowly we've dragged our feet, how far we have yet to go, or how many lives continue to be damaged and destroyed along the way.</p>

<p>We remember the dream but forget the fury. We have domesticated the dream, making it manageable but less visionary, a worthy goal for our future, but no longer an impatient claim on our present.</p>

<p>While King is most remembered for his dream of racial equality, the scope of his mature vision perceived that the "triple evils" of racism, poverty and militarism were interwoven with deadly efficiency. By the mid-'60s he declared that "the whole structure of American life must be changed" and called for a "radical redistribution of economic and political power." This is no Rainbow Coalition; it describes a massive revolution in values, priorities, commitments and actions.</p>

<p>King was unrelenting in his prophetic critique of the church's readiness to offer people a spiritual narcotic that made the status quo acceptable rather than embodying a vision that made revolutionary action inevitable. Had he not been assassinated on April 4, the title of his sermon, slated for April 6 was "Why America May Go to Hell."</p>

<p>There's the fury. King's prophetic dream did indeed envision a society united across boundaries &#151; a beloved community. But his no less prophetic fury saw and named with stark clarity the forces that impeded and actively resisted the dream.</p>

<p>And while those forces included &#151; and still include &#151; racism, they also include other forces: our addiction to militaristic "solutions" for human problems, the fueling of global hegemony, the growing gap between haves and have-nots within American society and within the global community, and the presumption that the planet is ours to plunder. King's dream is not about anything less than race, but especially in its maturity, it was fringed with a fury that was always about more than race.</p>

<p>In a world every bit as beset by evil as the one King left 35 years ago, we can ill afford to remember only the domesticated dream. Today, however softly and surreptitiously, the flames of war are being fanned across lines of religion and race. Today, no doubt, President Bush will voice platitudes aiming to praise King's dream. But, poised as he is to lead us into another war, it is worth trying to unleash a bit of King's fury.</p>

<p>In his famous "I have a Dream" speech in 1963, King declared, "It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. &#133; There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted full citizenship rights."</p>

<p>Would that our president today could hear King say the same, but concluding, "until those living in the Third World are granted full citizenship rights in the global community &#151; and global economy."</p>

<p>The option for King would not be between waging war on terrorism or becoming victims of terrorism. The option is between "nonviolent co-existence or violent co-annihilation."</p>

<p>If we fail to address the deep and unconscionable gap between rich and poor, the war on terrorism simply puts us in the driver's seat (for the time being) on the road to violent co-annihilation.</p>

<p>If he were alive, King would say that. God help us if we cannot hear it in his absence.</p>
