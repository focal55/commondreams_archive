<p><i>"The present moment is the only moment available to
us, and it is the door to all moments." </i>- Thich Nhat
Hanh
<p>I am in Baghdad with the Iraq Peace Team, and we will
stay here throughout any war. We will share the risks
of the millions who live here, and do our best to be a
voice for them to the world. Our risks are uncertain.
Thousands here will surely die. But most Iraqis will
survive, and so too, I hope, will I. 
<p>A banner the government put up a few blocks from where
we stay reads simply, "Baghdad: Where the World Comes
for Peace." 
<p>It's meant as propaganda, I'm sure, flattering Saddam
Hussein. But without knowing it, it states a simple
truth: that the world must be present for peace. We
must be present in Baghdad as in America - in Kashmir
or Chechnya, the Great Lakes, Palestine and Colombia -
where there is war, and rumors of war, we must be
present to build peace. 
<p>We are present.
<p>My country may arrest me as a traitor, or kill me
during saturation bombing, or shoot me during an
invasion. The Iraqis may arrest me as a spy, or cause
or use my death for propaganda. Civil unrest and mob
violence may claim me. I may be maimed. I may be
killed. 
<p>I am nervous. I am scared. I am hopeful. I am joyous,
and I joyously delight in the wonder that is my life.
<p>I love being alive. I love the splendor of our world,
the beauty of our bodies, and the miracle of our
minds. I bless the world for making me, and I bless
the world for taking me. I feed myself on the
fellowship we inspirit, in standing one with another
in this, this present moment, each moment unfolding to
its own best time.
<p>Different things move different members of our team,
but all of us are here out of deep concern for the
suffering of our brothers and sisters in Iraq. 20
years of almost constant war, and 12 years of brutal
sanctions, have killed hundreds of thousands of
innocents in Iraq. 
<p>We are here, today, because most of the world refused
to be present, then. What more right do I as an
American have to leave then all the people I've come
to love in Iraq? An accident of birth that gives me a
free pass throughout the world? 
<p>All of us are here out of a deep commitment to
nonviolence. Peace is not an abstract value that we
should just quietly express a hope for. It takes work.
It takes courage. It takes joy. 
<p>Peace takes risks. 
<p>War is catastrophe. It is terrorism on a truly,
massive scale. It is the physical, political and
spiritual devastation of entire peoples. War is the
imposition of such massive, deadly violence so as to
force the political solutions of one nation upon
another. War is the antithesis of democracy and
freedom. War is the most bloody, undemocratic, and
violently repressive of all human institutions.
<p>War is catastrophe. Why choose catastrophe?
<p>Even the threat of war is devastating. On March 11th,
when we visited a maternity hospital run by the
Dominican sisters here in Baghdad, we found that
eight, new mothers that day had demanded to have their
babies by Caesarean section - they didn't want to give
birth during the war. Six others spontaneously aborted
the same day. Is this spirit of liberation?
<p>Don't ask me where I find the courage to be present in
Iraq on the eve of war. 5 million people call Baghdad
home. 24 million human beings live in Iraq. Instead,
ask the politicians - on every side - where they find
the nerve to put so many human beings at such terrible
risk. 
<p>We're here for these people, as we're here for the
American people. The violence George Bush starts in
Iraq will not stop in Iraq. The senseless brutality of
this war signals future crimes of still greater
inhumanity. If we risk nothing to prevent this, it
will happen. If we would have peace, we must work as
hard, and risk as much, as the warmakers do for
destruction.

<p>Pacifism isn't passive. It's a radical challenge to
all aspects of worldly power. Nonviolence can prevent catastrophe. Nonviolence multiplies opportunities a thousand-fold, until seemingly insignificant events converge to tumble the tyranny of fears that violence plants within our hearts. Where violence denies freedom, destroys community, restricts choices - we must be present: cultivating our love, our active love, for our entire family of humanity. 

<p>We are daily visiting with families here in Iraq. We
are daily visiting hospitals here in Iraq, and doing
arts and crafts with the children. We are visiting
elementary schools, and high schools. We are fostering community. We are furthering connections. We are creating space for peace.

<p>We are not "human shields." We are not here simply in opposition to war. We are a dynamic, living presence - our own, small affirmation of the joy of being alive. Slowly stumbling, joyous and triumphant, full of all the doubts and failings all people hold in common - our presence here is a thundering, gentle call, to Americans as to Iraqis, of the affirmation of life.

<p>We must not concede war to the killers. War is not
liberation. It is not peace. War is devastation and
death. 

<p>Thuraya, a brilliant, young girl whom I've come to
love, recently wrote in her diary: 

<p>"We don't know what is going to happen. We might die,
and maybe we are living our last days in life. I hope
that everyone who reads my diary remember me and know
that there was an Iraqi girl who had many dreams in
her life..."

<p>Dream with us of a world where we do not let violence
rule our lives. Work with us for a world where
violence does not rule our lives. Peace is not an
abstract concept. We are a concrete, tangible reality.
We the peoples of our common world, through the
relationships we build with each other, and the risks
we take for one another - we are peace.  

<p>Our team here doesn't know what is going to happen any
more than does Thuraya. We too may die. But in her
name, in this moment, at the intersection of all our
lives, we send you this simple message: We are peace,
and we are present.
