<p>The time has come to recognize that the policy that sent Paul Bremer to govern Iraq -- aided by U.S. and British troops scattered around the country -- has failed. It will continue to fail, at ever-greater cost. 



<p>Its hugely ambitious aims are to rebuild the Iraqi economy and set the country on a path toward free-market prosperity, while at the same time constructing a democracy pluralist enough to accommodate Iraq's diversity and serve as a model for other Arab nations. 



<p>The first aim requires troops and contractors to rebuild schools, hospitals, electrical, water and transport infrastructure -- even museums -- as well as all manner of oil and gas installations in hundreds of places all over Iraq. 



<p>The second requires a great deal of time. Constitutional consultations have yet to begin, and it will not be easy to draft a federal constitution that satisfies Arabs, Kurds, Turkomans and lesser ethnicities, as well as Shiites, Sunnis, Jazidis and the major Christian religions. To hold elections would also require a census and population registry. But to reach that point, the draft constitution must, of course, be approved by referendum, and it is by no means certain -- or indeed even likely -- that the Iraqi Shiite majority would vote for a constitution that allows any deviation from Islamic law to accommodate religious minorities. 



<p>Even if that hurdle can somehow be overcome, the entire process would need years, not months -- as was originally anticipated, not least by Mr. Bremer himself.



<p>It now turns out, however, that both the economic and the political aims of the occupation are not merely extremely demanding, as everyone knew from the start, but simply impossible to achieve.



<p>That's not because a waning number of Saddam Hussein's gunmen, and a growing number of Islamist volunteers from Saudi Arabia, Syria and elsewhere have started a guerilla war. If they alone were the problem, U.S. and British forces, far superior in numbers and skills, could cope well enough. 



<p>What guarantees failure is not even the sad fact that incidents of sabotage and theft -- everything from copper high-tension lines to shiploads of scarce motor fuel -- are visibly gaining ground on the reconstruction effort, so that Iraq is regressing in everything from electrical supply to the number of real paid jobs in its economy. Mr. Bremer's remedy -- to have U.S. taxpayers send aid faster than Iraqi gangs can steal it -- may be rejected by Congress in an election year, but at least, in theory, it could be a solution. 



<p>Nor does it matter how much some prominent Iraqis excluded from the Governing Council are campaigning against it and the entire constitutional path, yet curiously enough are still being allowed to travel back and forth to raise funds in the gulf, and address "anti-imperialist" rallies in Western Europe. For that, too, there are remedies, including enlarging the Governing Council or locking up the worst troublemakers.



<p>But there are no possible remedies for the fundamental cause of failure: Most Iraqis simply do not believe that the occupation is benevolent, and they therefore refuse to collaborate to make it a success. They do not report guerillas, saboteurs, thieves and traffickers unless they are personal enemies. They do nothing to protect the water pipes and electrical supply on which they themselves depend, let alone oil facilities and such. They are not helping the troops who are repairing schools and hospitals for the Iraqis' own families, and certainly do not warn soldiers if they spot imminent attacks. 



<p>Even government officials do as little work as possible, while constantly demanding facilities that their U.S. supervisors are doing without. Under these circumstances, it is sheer fantasy to expect Iraqis to collaborate in a far more sustained fashion, to establish the structures of a pluralist democracy under American guidance.



<p>Nor is there anything perverse about these refusals, given the Iraqi world view.



<p>Saddam Hussein's one moment of genuine popularity came immediately after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, when Iraqi troops on leave returned to their families with their loot, everything from bits of clothing to solid-gold doorknobs, and even the full-size American cars favoured by Kuwaitis.



<p>If the invasion of Iraq had been followed by the organized looting of Iraqi museums and bank vaults, and the prompt sale of oil fields to U.S. and British companies, Iraqis would of course have protested bitterly and tried to resist, but at least they would have understood.



<p>As it is, they are being asked to believe that U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair -- Christian imperialists both, as the Iraqis see it -- unaccountably want Iraqi Muslims to be prosperous and free. This they consider a childish deception, an insult to their intelligence. The Iraqi editorialists now writing in the newly liberated press do not agree on the real purpose of the occupation -- is it to undermine Islam? Is it to destroy the Arab nation? Is it to hand over Iraq to the Jews? Or is it just to overproduce Iraqi oil fields to wreck both OPEC and Iraq's future? 



<p>As for the freedom and equality bit, is it meant to encourage daughters to dishonour their families by talking with boys not their brothers? Or is there a wider aim to demoralize the Muslim community with alcohol, pornography and drugs? 



<p>Iraqis at large no doubt believe in a mixture of motives, none good. Mentalities change, of course, and after two or three decades of relentless benevolence, Iraqis might overcome their incredulity -- but that would require more blood and treasure than the entire Middle East is worth.



<p>Fortunately, there is an alternative. Now that the Iraq Governing Council is up and running, our officials can be recalled from Baghdad, and reduced U.S. and British garrisons can be moved to remote desert bases, with everyday security left to the police, and to the Kurdish and Shiite militias supplied with more radios and vehicles -- after all, they have plenty of weapons. That way, any Baathist resurrection or foreign intrusion could still be prevented, reconstruction will immediately become an Iraqi responsibility funded with Iraqi revenues, and Iraqis alone will design their government.



<p>There is nothing shameful about high ambitions and an excess of benevolence, but to persist now would undermine the world's faith in the rationality of American statecraft. As for the credibility of U.S. resolve in the Middle East, there is nothing to worry about: The march of the Marines with their landing craft all the way to Tikrit took care of that for a few generations to come.
