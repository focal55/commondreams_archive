<p>This is the War, planned in the house, that George bought.

<p>These are the beliefs, that created the land, <br>



that fought the War, planned in the house, that George bought.

<p>This is the soldier, that did his duty, <br>



to protect the beliefs, that created the land, <br>



that fought the War, planned in the house, that George bought.

<p>This is the family, that mourns the soldier, that did his duty, <br>



to protect the beliefs, that created the land, <br>



that fought the War, planned in the house, that George bought.

<p>This is the Country, we’re told is evil, that born a man, that fired a shot, <br>



that made the family, that mourns the soldier, that did his duty, <br>



to protect the beliefs, that created the land, <br>



that fought the War, planned in the house, that George bought.

<p>These are the contracts, to rebuild the cities, paid with the profits, <br>



that came from oil, that’s pumped from ground, <br>



that’s in the Country, we’re told is evil, that born a man, that fired a shot, <br>



that made the family, that mourns the soldier, that did his duty, <br>



to protect the beliefs, that created the land, <br>



that fought the War, planned in the house, that George bought.

<p>These are the campaign contributions, made to the leaders, <br>



that failed the Nation, by selling our trust, to the allied firms, <br>



that got the contracts, to rebuild the cities, paid with the profits, <br>



that came from oil, that’s pumped from the ground, <br>



that’s in the Country, we’re told is evil, that born a man, that fired a shot, <br>



that made the family, that mourns the soldier, that did his duty, <br>



to protect the beliefs, that created the land, <br>



that fought the War, planned in the house, that George bought.
