<p> Today, we find ourselves regularly barraged with headlines that
                     make us ask, "What is happening in our nation and world, and
                     can we do anything to stop the madness?" This month, we were
                     told more than 43 million Americans, a fourth of these children, are
                     without health insurance, an increase of more than 3 million in the
                     last year. Millions more are underinsured.

<p>  By contrast, we are spending more than $1 billion per day on
                     defense, funding Cold War relic weapons systems and weapons
                     of mass destruction, including new nuclear weapons. Where is our
                     credibility when we do this at the same time we state a desire to
                     rid the world of these weapons? Is this what national security
                     looks like?

<p>  We also are advised that, once again, the
                                     United States leads the world in sales of

                                     conventional weapons to developing nations,
                                     an increase of 10 percent from 2001; we
                                     provide nearly half of all new arms transfer
                                     agreements and deliveries. This fact alone
                                     ignores that part of civilization is crying out in
                                     desperation to meet the critical basic human
                                     needs of clean water, health care, education
                                     and housing. Many of these armed nations
                                     have not embraced internationally accepted
                                     human rights policies, reinforcing the
                                     falsehood that the enemy of my enemy is my
                                     friend. Which will be tomorrow's Afghanistan
                                     and Iraq guaranteeing the future loss of
                                     American and international lives?

<p> Our addiction to more weapons and their
                                     continued development and sales gives a
                                     false sense of security, ultimately, benefiting
                                     only those involved in these sales, including
                                     those in our present administration, giving
                                     rise to a state of perpetual war. This
                                     continuing disastrous spiral is not sustainable
                                     and imperils our future.

<p>  Our survivability demands a shift in our
                                     thinking. But how? Is there hope? Can we
                                     move beyond the fear instilled in us daily by
                                     the above policies, the color-coded alerts and
                                     infringements of liberties by the Patriot acts?

<p>  We have two choices: to continue the
                                     present course, financially and morally
                                     bankrupting our nation and future
                                     generations, or moving in a new direction.
                                     Fortunately, there is a vision and a movement
                                     to address these issues. It has been outlined
                                     in an incredible document: <a href="http://www.earthcharter.org/" target="_new">the Earth Charter</a>.

<p>  The Earth Charter is a statement of global
                                     interdependence and shared responsibility
                                     for the well-being of the human family and
                                     the planet. It provides a blueprint for
                                     achieving a sustainable future and a practical
                                     way to create a safe, secure and peaceful
                     tomorrow.

<p> The drafting of the Earth Charter followed the 1992 Rio Earth
                     Summit. It is the most collaborative document in history resulting
                     from a global, grass-roots drafting process that involved more
                     than 100,000 people in 78 countries over the course of 12 years.
                     It was launched at the Hague Peace Palace in June 2000. The
                     sources for the Earth Charter include contemporary science,
                     international law, the world's religions and philosophical
                     traditions, the global ethics movement, numerous
                     nongovernmental declarations and people's treaties issued over
                     the past three decades, and best practices for building
                     sustainable communities.

<p>  The mission of the Earth Charter is to establish a sound, ethical
                     foundation for the global community and to help build a
                     sustainable world based on respect for nature, universal human
                     rights, and a culture of peace.

<p>  Ultimately, we must decide. The time is now.

<p> Quoting from the Earth Charter, "Let ours be a time remembered
                     for the awakening of a new reverence for life, the firm resolve to
                     achieve sustainability, the quickening of the struggle for justice
                     and peace, and the joyful celebration of life."

<p> Saturday marks the third annual Earth Charter Community
                     Summit. This summit will link, via webcast, 30 cities in the United
                     States with each other and four countries, India, Scotland,
                     Belgium and West Africa. The intent of these summits is to
                     educate and to celebrate the principles of the Earth Charter, and
                     to explore ways to implement them into the local communities.

<p>  Ventura will be one of only two cities in Southern California to
                     host the Earth Charter Summit.
