<p>Don't you just love a President who takes responsibility?


<p>There was George Bush at his press conference, answering a tough question about his triumphant arrival on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln and the "Mission Accomplished" sign there. Bush said that sign was not the brilliant idea of one of his ingenious advance men. No, not at all, Bush said. The soldiers aboard ship thought that one up.


<p>It was a classic, Clintonian, reflex of a liar.


<p>"After the news conference, the White House Press Secretary, Scott McClellan, said that the banner had in fact been made by the White House advance team," The New York Times reported. But then McClellan added what seems to me to be an obvious fib saying the banner was made "at the request of those on the ship."


<p>I'm willing to bet any amount of money that the soldiers didn't dream up the slogan.


<p>This may seem like a small point, but it gets to Bush's chronic lying and his dodging of responsibility.


<p>At his press conference, Bush kept at it, saying the U.S. military was "striking the enemy with force and precision" -- an ill-timed claim, especially because on Monday U.S. soldiers killed six Iraqi civilians in a reckless response to a roadside bomb. And Human Rights Watch reports that U.S. soldiers have killed at least 94 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad alone.


<p>That does not sound like precision to me.


<p>Bush also furthered the lie that the only people opposing the United States were "Baathists and foreign terrorists."


<p>But a captain with the 82nd Airborne told British journalist Robert Fisk that his forces were facing "local freedom fighters," as well. Fisk reports that many "ordinary Iraqis" have taken up arms against the occupation.


<p>If that's the case, then Bush's Iraq mission is likely to get more impossible with each imprecise strike by U.S. troops
