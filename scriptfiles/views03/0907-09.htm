<p>One of the great media cliches of the past two years is that Sept. 11 
"changed everything." The portentous idea soon became a truism for news 
outlets nationwide. At the end of 2001, the front page of The Chronicle 
asserted in large type: "Attack on the U.S. changed everyone and everything 
everywhere."
<P>But the shock of Sept. 11 could not endure. And the events of that horrific 
day -- while abruptly tilting the political landscape and media discourse -- 
did not transform the lives of most Americans. Despite all the genuine anguish 
and the overwhelming news coverage, daily life gradually went back to an 
approximation of normal.
<P>Yes, some changes are obvious. Worries about terrorism have become routine. 
Out of necessity, stepped-up security measures are in effect at airports. 
Unnecessarily, and ominously, the USA Patriot Act is chipping away at civil 
liberties. Yet the basic concerns of Sept. 10, 2001, remain with us today.
<P>Many of the front-page headlines that greeted newspaper readers on the 
morning of Sept. 11 seem timeless. The New York Times: "Violence in Mideast, 
Despite Plans to Talk." The Washington Post: "GOP Seeks to Ease Fears on 
Economy." A Los Angeles Times heading told of a "scramble to fix economy." 
While one of The Chronicle's headlines focused on a "milestone domestic 
partners bill," in Sacramento, another referred matter-of-factly to the "bad 
economy."
<P>The nation's current economic picture includes the familiar scourges of 
unemployment, job insecurity, eroding pension benefits and a wildly exorbitant 
health-care system that endangers vast numbers of people who are uninsured or 
underinsured. Two years later, the power of money is undiminished -- 
notwithstanding every platitude that bounced around the media echo chamber 
after Sept. 11.
<P>During the last months of 2001, many media powerhouses heralded the arrival 
of humanistic values for the country. Typically, the December issue of O -- 
"The Oprah Magazine" -- was largely devoted to the cover story, "We Are Family.
" In the leadoff essay, Oprah Winfrey served up a heaping portion of sweet 
pablum. "Our vision of family has been expanded," she wrote. "From the ashes 
of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and that field in Pennsylvania arose 
a new spirit of unity. We realize that we are all part of the family of 
America." Later in the glossy, ad-filled magazine, the "We Are Family" 
headline reappeared under Old Glory and over another message from Oprah, who 
declared: "America is a vast and complicated family, but -- as the smoke 
clears and the dust settles -- a family nonetheless."
<P>In politics, we're told, perception is reality. To the extent that pundits 
and the average American believed that Sept. 11 "changed everything," the 
notion gained momentum. But the pretense could be maintained only so long. 
Just as huckstering commercials returned full-force to TV and radio, the usual 
economic priorities kicked in for the nation as a whole.
<P>From the vantage point of the present day, the late-2001 claims about a new 
national altruism invite disbelief if not derision. No amount of media spin 
about "the family of America" can negate the fact that gaps between wealth and 
poverty have never been wider. What kind of affluent family would leave so 
many of its members in desperate need?
<P>As measured by poll numbers, President Bush's fall from popular grace this 
year has brought him back to about where he was just before Sept. 11. That 
decline runs parallel with slumping myths about the transcendent aftermath of 
Sept. 11. Subsequent events have brought sobering realities into focus.
<P>Recent news about Halliburton and Bechtel cashing in on the occupation of 
Iraq is a counterpoint to revelations that the White House strongly pressured 
the Environmental Protection Agency in the days after Sept. 11 to mislead the 
public about dangers of airborne toxic particles from World Trade Center 
debris. The EPA's Office of the Inspector General reported last month that 
"the desire to reopen Wall Street" was a major factor in the Bush 
administration's misleading assurances.
<P>Although the public was told that everything had changed, powerful elites 
gave the highest priority to resuming business as usual. Apparently, people 
living and working in lower Manhattan have been viewed as expendable the past 
two years -- by the same officials who've gone to great lengths to underscore 
their deep caring about the victims of Sept. 11. This wrenching scandal, which 
has caused visceral outrage in the New York area, threatens to pull scabs off 
festering wounds.
<P>After Sept. 11, while many thousands of people grieved the sudden loss of 
their loved ones, a steady downpour of politically driven sentimentality kept 
blurring the U.S. media's window on the world. Politicians in high office, 
from President Bush on down, rushed to identify themselves as representing the 
dead and their relatives. Cataclysmic individual losses were swiftly 
expropriated for mass dissemination.
<P>In a cauldron of media alchemy, the human suffering of Sept. 11 became 
propaganda gold. Sorrow turned into political capital.
<P>The human process of mourning is intimate and often at a loss for words; 
journalists and politicians tend to be neither. Grief borders on the ineffable.
<P>News coverage gravitates toward cliches and facile images.
<P>In tandem with the message that Sept. 11 "changed everything" came an 
emboldened insistence on the U.S. prerogative to attack other countries at 
will. In a bait-and-switch operation that took hold in autumn 2001, emblems of 
Sept. 11 soon underwent double exposure with prevailing political agendas.
<P>Displayed by many as an expression of sorrow and solidarity with the Sept. 
11 victims, the American flag was promptly overlaid on the missiles bound for 
Afghanistan. In TV studios, the Stars and Stripes, like angelic symbols 
dancing on the heads of pins, got stuck on the lapels of many newscasters.
<P>Network correspondents routinely joined in upbeat assessments of the U.S.-
led assault on Afghanistan that took the lives of at least as many blameless 
civilians as Sept. 11 did. Later, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, which 
overthrew a regime in Baghdad with no links to the Sept. 11 hijackings or al 
Qaeda, took more civilian lives than Sept. 11 did. For the United States, 
moral reflection could not hold a candle to the righteous adrenaline of war.
<P>"An unexciting truth may be eclipsed by a thrilling lie," Aldous Huxley 
observed. But media perception is not reality -- and Sept. 11 did not change 
the folly of confusing the two.
