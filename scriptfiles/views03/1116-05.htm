<p>It looks like it's official.  We're going to "cut and
run" from Iraq.

<p>Oh, to be sure, that's not what the standard press
reports say.  They say the president insists, "We will
NOT cut and run from Iraq."  But the media has proven singularly credulous (that's the most charitable way we can put it) regarding the administration's pronouncements on Iraq.

<p>So herewith, a simple, foolproof system for
understanding what is really going on:  believe
exactly the opposite of whatever the administration
says.  That's right.  Whatever they say with regards
to policy, you may be drop-dead certain the exact
opposite is actually the truth.

<p>This system's virtues are two-fold.  First, it is
absurdly simple.  Any fool not aspiring to be a
"professional" journalist can make it work from the
comfort of his own home.   Its second virtue is that
it is unerringly accurate.   It just never fails.
Whatever they say, believe the opposite.

<p>Let's see how it performs in service and then test it
on the "cut and run" declaration.

<p>In August of last year the administration said we had
to invade Iraq because Iraq would not allow U.N.
weapons inspectors inside.  In fact, they allowed
inspectors inside.

<p>They said the inspectors were not being allowed to do
their job.  The inspectors announced that they had not
been denied access to a single site.

<p>The administration told us the Iraqis had been trying
to buy processed uranium from Africa.  Their own man
on the scene, Joseph Wilson, had told them-and later
the public-that this was not true.

<p>They told us that "most experts believe" the aluminum
tubes had no other use than in centrifuges for
enriching uranium.  In fact, their own experts had
told them that the tubes were not suited for such
purposes.

<p>They said the Iraqis possessed "thousands of tons" of
chemical and biological weapons.  As it turns out, of
course, they possessed none.  None.

<p>We were told the Iraqis had an advanced program in
place to develop nuclear weapons.  They simply had
nothing of the kind.  Nothing.

<p>We were told the Iraqis had connections to Al Qaeda.
The CIA's own report a year before the invasion denied
any such connection.  Saddam Hussein and Osama bin
Ladin are blood enemies.

<p>We were bludgeoned with the intimation Iraq was behind
the tragedy of 9/11.  The truth, of course, is that
they had nothing whatsoever to do with it.  The
president was forced to concede this recently, even
against the continuing and embarrassing public
insistence to the contrary by his own Vice President.

<p>We were told Iraq posed an imminent threat to the
security of the region.  But not a single one of
Iraq's neighbors claimed to feel threatened by Iraq.

<p>We were told the invasion was approved by United
Nations resolution but the U.N.'s Secretary General
denied any such imprimatur and insisted the U.S. was
in violation of both the U.N. charter and
international law.

<p>We were told before it started that there was simply
no way to know what the war would cost.  But Lawrence
Lindsey's $200 billion estimate has proven eerily
prescient if not conservative.  Lindsey was hustled
out of Washington faster than anyone since David
Stockman let slip that supply side economics was a
"Trojan Horse" for shifting more national wealth to
the already fabulously wealthy.

<p>The administration told us they had exhausted every
single possibility of avoiding war.  Now we learn that
even in the final days before the war they were
rebuffing urgent offers of settlement from senior
Iraqi officials.

<p>We were told the invasion would make us more safe,
that it would begin dismembering a global terrorist
network.  Now the CIA tells us the invasion has
sparked a holy war against the United States,
revitalizing global recruitment of young Muslims
willing to die in order to bloody the US's nose.  We
are less safe.

<p>We were told there was a "coalition of the willing"
that supported our aims and would provide help in the
project.  Only England, ever ready to return the
insult to its failed imperial rule, has proven willing
while former allies Turkey, India, Pakistan, and now
even Japan have snubbed us.

<p>We were told that France, Germany, Russia and China,
reluctant to miss out on a feeding frenzy, would
sheepishly come aboard once the war was underway.
They are nowhere to be found and we stand naked and increasingly isolated.

<p>We were told that the war would prove a "cakewalk,"
that it would be "over in months, if not weeks."
There's cake involved, it's true, but it's on Bush's
and Cheney's and Rumsfeld's and Wolfowitz' faces.

<p>We were told, "we know where the weapons are."  Iraq
is now the most inspected country in the history of
the planet and not a single shred of weapons of mass destruction has been found.

<p>We were told "we've found the weapons of mass
destruction."  They turned out to be two trucks for
inflating weather balloons.

<p>We were told our mission was to bring "democracy" to
Iraq.  But we also insisted we would never allow the
Iraqis to elect a Shi'ite government.  Shi'ites
represent 60% of Iraq's population.

<p>We were told we would be treated as liberators, that
the Iraqis would be throwing flowers in our paths for
rescuing them from an evil dictator.  We were
welcomed, all right, but with rocket propelled
grenades, AK-47s, anti-tank mines and ambushes.  Most
Iraqis insist they were better off under Saddam
Hussein.

<p>We were told the invasion would be "self-funding,"
that Iraq's vast oil wealth would pay for the
invasion, the occupation, and the rebuilding.  Turns
out it will not begin to come close and that the
American citizens are picking up the tab to the tune
of multiple billions of dollars a week.

<p>We were told the international community would support
us financially.  The stated target of the Madrid
Donor's Conference was $56 billion in pledges.  Only
$33 billion was actually raised with $29 billion of
that put up by the U.S. and its front organizations.


<p>Most recently, we were told things were going
swimmingly and that it was only the negative media
that was distorting the situation.  In fact, there is
chaos on the ground, demoralization among the troops,
complete collapse of essential civic services and
swelling rage massing throughout vast portions of the
Iraqi population.

<p>This is only a short list, hastily thrown together.
Its purpose was to test the simplicity and the
accuracy of the Do-It-Yourself-Bush-Iraq-Policy-Pronouncement-Divination-System.
 Whatever they say, know that the truth is the exact
opposite.

<p>The system's efficacy speaks for itself.  And the only requirements for using it are that your IQ be larger than your belt size and that you not be a "professional" journalist.

<p>Now for the final test.  Here's the situation.  The
CIA's internal report (not the happy story offered for
public consumption) says the situation is close to
spiraling out of control.  The locals smell blood.
Bush's poll numbers are sinking like a hot rock
through fresh snow.  Elections are 12 months away.
Karl Rove still sets policy in the White House.

<p>Bush says the U.S. "will not cut and run from Iraq."

<p>What else could it possibly mean?
