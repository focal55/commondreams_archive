<p>Some anti-war folks may be feeling deflated as they view the chaos and desperation rampant in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. But Kathy Kelly will quickly say this isn't the time to lose heart. 

<p>"It's important to say that the peace movement globally came close to preventing the war against Iraq," stresses Kelly, who is a founder of <a href="http://www.vitw.org/" target="_new">Voices in the Wilderness</a>, a group dedicated to ending economic sanctions and warfare against Iraq. Those who opposed the war were right, she says, and must not stop beating the drum for peace. 

<p>Kelly just came back from three and a half months in Iraq, watching the buildup and execution of the U.S.-British war. She says that as she was leaving Baghdad, the refrain she heard repeatedly from frantic Iraqis coping with the post-bombing anarchy that troops did nothing to quell was: "We were liberated from the notion that the U.S. ever wanted to help us." 

<p>President Bush's go-it-alone war means peace activists must strive to counter the ongoing propaganda that may be a harbinger of further military action against countries Bush deems evil, Kelly says. A clamor also must be raised to ensure the United Nations helps rebuild Iraq. 

<p>The peace movement "took a bruising but can get its act together," Kelly rightfully asserts. She will exhort activists to regroup and move forward at Saturday's Voices for Peace Day rally on Library Mall (<a href="http://www.voicesforpeaceday.org" target="_new">www.voicesforpeaceday.org</a>).
