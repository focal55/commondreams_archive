<p>We ask because mere mortals (regular folks, Middle America, whatever you want to call the vast majority) seem to never be able to get their hands on one. Average Janes and Joes go to jail when they're caught red-handed; they pay fines when they've transgressed; they suffer when they're publicly humiliated.
<p>
Not so the Teflons among us. Their shiny, impenetrable surface makes them invincible. Punishment for crimes and misdemeanors never sticks. Bad press slides right off. Ill will ricochets with alarming ease.
<p>
We've seen a lot of Teflons triumphing of late. Arnold Schwarzenegger was easily elected governor of California even when reports surfaced of his groping hands and admiration for Hitler. Jessica Lynch remained an American hero (and Sigma Chi-ish sweetheart) despite semi-nude pictures that surfaced at the time of her made-for-TV movie. Rush Limbaugh victoriously returned to the airwaves after five weeks in a recovery program for his addiction to prescription painkillers (and even before that, Limbaugh weathered cries of racism over a comment he made as an ESPN commentator). Rosie O'Donnell emerged as a winner in her magazine courtroom drama even after a witness said the comedian cruelly joked about the woman's battle with cancer. Ronald Reagan - the person for whom "Teflon president" was coined - prevailed, even in his infirmity, as CBS dumped its "The Reagans" miniseries because it allegedly showed the former president in an unflattering light.
<p>
What do all these celebrities have in common? That Teflon armour. And it seems that the Teflon phenomenon grows more flagrant and unbelievable each day. Does anyone really think that Kobe Bryant will be convicted of sexual assault? Or that Paris Hilton's incipient television career will greatly suffer because of a sex video circulating on the Internet? Or that Martha Stewart will lose it all over her securities fraud brouhaha?
<p>
No. Why? Because celebrities - whether they're movie stars, politicians, business giants, heiresses or actual royalty - are coated in Teflon.
<p>
"The culture loves its celebrities to crash and burn. But then it loves to bring them back," said Anthony Mora, a marketing and public relations expert. "It's a forgiving culture in that it gives celebrities second, third, fourth and fifth chances."
<p>
Even for Michael Jackson?
<p>
"Sometimes it's just not going to matter," said Mora, an expert on the art of the spin and, not incidentally, author of "Spin To Win." "Our culture is much more obsessed with fame than it is with the issues surrounding it."
<p>
Issues, shmissues. That attitude has made it possible for Winona Ryder to continue acting after being caught shoplifting. For Hugh Grant to remain a wildly popular star after that nasty business with a hooker. For Bill Clinton to retain his high approval ratings throughout the Monica Lewinsky scandal. For George W. Bush to get elected president four days after it was revealed he was convicted of drunken driving in 1976. For Lizzie Grubman to return to the art of public relations even after mowing down 16 people with her SUV. For Prince Charles to invoke the non-answer answer when addressing the question of whether he had sexual relations with a royal valet. Even for a wealthy real-estate heir to get away with what seems like murder: Despite admitting that he dismembered his neighbor's corpse, Robert Durst was acquitted of murder by a Texas jury.
<p>
In most cases, Teflons are aided by the public relations machine and media feeding frenzy that attends all celebrity scandal.
<p>
"PR, marketing and advertising is hand in glove with information now," said Nancy Snow, a professor of communications at Cal State Fullerton and the author of "Information War." "We don't let the facts get in the way of a good narrative."
<p>
Snow said that celebrity scandal has become entertainment and that, for a majority of the American public, entertainment is more important than simple things like facts and justice.
<p>
"If the image is powerful enough, you can't help being pulled in. Even if you're skeptical, you get pulled in by the whole magic," she said. "But it's a two-way street. PR isn't just doing it to us; we're fully complicit in it."
<p>
And that strange complicity - the way the public devours yet gingerly handles celebrity scandal - will only become more pronounced during the unfolding Michael Jackson saga, Snow said. "We can't turn away. We'll keep watching Michael Jackson all day," she said. "We think we're above it, but we're glued to it. We keep going back for more."
<p>
Even when we know we shouldn't.
<p>
Paris Hilton is a perfect example of that. A celebrity for no other reason than that she's a rich girl who likes to expose herself, Hilton has been the subject of intense media glare since her sex video popped up on the Internet. While Hilton may be legitimately upset about the tacky video, one has to wonder if it's just coincidence that the Hilton headlines come right as her new reality show, "The Simple Life," is set to bow on Fox on Tuesday.
<p>
"It won't hurt her," Mora said of Hilton's porn scandal. "She'll come out of it unscathed. If it had been a celebrity with a very different image, like a Nicole Kidman or a Julia Roberts, that would be different. But we're talking about someone who achieved fame strictly as a goal, who goes to parties in outrageous dresses."
<p>
So where does that leave Jackson, who is severely testing the strength of his Teflon?
<p>
"It's about child molestation - that's the case. But everyone's writing about everything but that. It's getting lost in the carnival," Mora said.
<p>
He added that the PR machine - Teflon's magic buffer - is already going into high gear, and that will definitely affect how the public perceives Jackson's latest scandal, if not the outcome of the court case itself.
<p>
"PR alters the perspective of what people think or feel about a particular person or topic," he said. "PR realizes that the court of public opinion is going to hold more weight than the court itself, and it's going to precede it."
<p>
So F. Scott Fitzgerald was right: The rich are different.
<p>
They can, apparently, afford really good Teflon.</p>
