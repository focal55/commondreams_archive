<p><i>Aidan Johnson is a 2002-2003 U.S. State Department Fulbright Scholar pursuing graduate studies in economic journalism and financial history at New York University. The following is an edited excerpt from his end-of-the-year report, addressed to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.</i>

<p>Dear Secretary Powell,



<p>Thank you for the opportunity to write this reflection on my year as a Fulbright Scholar. Out of respect for the State Department scholarship fund's goal of advancing open international dialogue, I will write honestly.



<p>When I came to study in the United States, I had a vague notion that America's primary goal was the spreading of freedom and democracy, within its own borders and around the world. I knew that its methods had some nasty side effects, like pollution and trade deals that disadvantage Third World farmers. All the same, I was generally on board with your vision of America.



<p>That was then.



<p>Today, I'm starting to understand a word popularized by Senator William Fulbright's colleague, Senator Joseph McCarthy: "un-American." Much of what I've seen in America is exactly that, though I believe McCarthy had the word's meaning backwards.



<p>Even with its exclusion of Indians and blacks and women as citizens, the founding of the U.S. was based on a set of ideas that no sane Westerner can oppose: free speech, free elections, free life. Those are the values the American flag represents.



<p>A lot of my friends see the stars and stripes as a symbol of imperialism. 



<p>I can't agree. 



<p>Abolitionists, suffragettes, civil rights activists, Vietnam War protesters, and all the other great heroes of American history mostly all rallied to the flag. To be sure, some were anarchists who saw America as an irredeemable oppressor. The flag wasn't for these few, save for the witless among them who stooped to flag-burning.



<p>One of the most popular slogans at U.S. peace marches this year proclaimed that "Protest is patriotic." It's almost as bad as the slogan, "not in our name," which can be refuted by right wingers faster than a pre-emptive strike. "Okay, not in your name. Mine." 



<p>I hate the "protest is patriotic" slogan because it's defeatist. It stoops to debate with McCarthy's fallacy that protest is unpatriotic. If something is deemed worth debating, it gains a certain limited legitimacy. But McCarthyism has none.



<p>Besides, there's something suspicious about people who have to loudly insist to the world that they have some quality or other, and make that insistence a key part of their message. They usually have something to hide — like doubt.



<p>Opponents of U.S. President George Bush should wrap themselves in the American flag, without hesitation. The left may have a death wish for giving away power, but that doesn't mean all leftists have to give, give, give. (And yes, there is an organized American left, in the endangered progressive wings of two major parties plus the much more important and growing Green and citizens' movements.)



<p>But I wasn't thinking any of these thoughts during my first semester at NYU.



<p>Everything seemed normal then. In fact, New York didn't seem tremendously different from Toronto. Sure, there were more homeless people and fewer (make that no) progressive voices in my classes, but I shrugged, "It's America. That's just how it is."



<p>Then epiphany came like a bolt of lightning from the sky — or more accurately, a fighter plane swooping over Iraq. The moral blindness of my pro-war classmates made me see the imperialism and destructiveness of the U.S. foreign policy agenda really for the first time.



<p>As the war began, I came across a quotation from a past president: "Our interest must march forward, altruists though we are; other nations must see to it that they stand off, and do not seek to stay us." That was Woodrow Wilson, speaking almost a century ago about the U.S. invasion of the Philippines.



<p>But back to Iraq. While e-mails poured onto my screen from Canada in the war's early days, expressing relief that no maple leafs would be blown over Baghdad, my American classmates were busy convincing themselves that war was a sad but necessary chore — clipping gross toenails rather than killing in the name of patriotism.



<p>I asked my business journalism class why a front-page New York Times caption described soldiers finding "boxes of parts that could be used to equip suicide bombers." Couldn't it be, "soldiers find boxes but no weapons of mass destruction?"



<p>"You're missing the point," one of the brighter girls told me icily. She might have added: "You terrorist." But she refrained; I'm a nice Canadian. Good thing no one in the States knows about the FLQ.



<p>A visiting editor from CNBC (the NBC financial news network) said to one of my classes: "Though we often say the war is about freedom and democracy, I don't mind telling you as future market reporters that people in the know admit that it's actually about America's economic interests, including oil." To which a boy in the class remarked, without a trace of irony: "Sometimes journalists just have to be bearers of propaganda, don't they?" The class nodded solemnly.



<p>Certain images stay with you.



<p>I'm pleased to report, however, that I've also seen America's good side, that is, the side that's genuinely patriotic.



<p>At church (Harlem Abyssinian Church of 138th St., New York's oldest and largest black congregation, where I've been worshipping since September), the lives and politics of my friends showed me that authentic patriotism requires tolerance, progressive action, and courage, in the tradition of Martin Luther King.



<p>I've never felt more welcome in America than I did last Wednesday, when the pastor greeted me in front of the congregation at an evening prayer meeting for Iraq as ``Brother Aidan.'' In a church where the lingering impact of slavery is a regular sermon theme, that's a nice compliment for a white boy to receive, even if he is from Canada.



<p>The following Sunday, the minister decried a government decision to close a Harlem employment centre that runs on a shoestring $25,000 budget.



<p>``Remember, beloved,'' he said, ``Twenty-five thousand dollars buys one screw on an aircraft carrier.''



<p>My participation in the Fulbright Program has me constantly asking Ouisa Kitridge's question from the play Six Degrees of Separation: ``How do I prevent my experiences from becoming anecdotes?''



<p>Because I've had a lot of experiences here, Secretary Powell. Good and bad.



<p>I've made amazing friends. I've seen amazing things. And I've learned things I will never forget.



<p>Thank you for the scholarship.





<p>Sincerely,



<p>Aidan Johnson
