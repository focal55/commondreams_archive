<p>AUSTIN, Texas -- One interesting aspect of the Seriously Dumb Tax Cut 

we are watching develop in Washington is that we are simultaneously 

witnessing the effects of Seriously Dumb Tax Cuts at the state level. The 

states are plotzing right and left, caught in hideous binds -- whether 

it is better to release dangerous prisoners or cut back the schools, 

cut back health care for kids or nursing homes for old folks.

	<p>Politically, it's notoriously difficult to oppose tax cuts precisely 

because the trouble doesn't show up until after the next election, but 

this time we have are having our noses rubbed in the results even as 

Bush proposes to do it again at the federal level.

	<p>And what a tax cut it is. According to <a href="http://www.ctj.org/" target="_new">Citizens for Tax Justice</a>, the 

wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, those who make over $356,000 a year, 

will get almost 50 percent of the benefit of eliminating the tax on 

dividends and 45 percent of the money from accelerating the rate cuts. The 

80 percent of the households making less than $73,000 a year would get 

less than 10 percent of the new tax breaks.

	<p>The Bushies have various ways of justifying this monstrosity, none of 

which holds up under scrutiny. The first claim is that the rich pay 

more in taxes in the first place. Well, yeah, they do: They have more 

money. The richest 1 percent have 18 percent of all the pretax income and 

they pay 36 percent of all personal income taxes. But one of the many 

disingenuous tricks with statistics you will see used by the Soak the 

Poor school is to ignore the rest of the tax burden. Most of us actually 

pay more in payroll taxes than we do in income taxes, but FICA taxes cut 

OFF at $87,000 -- you make more than that, you don't have to pay on the 

rest. And of course the sales tax is notoriously regressive -- rich 

families and poor families alike pay the same sales tax on a refrigerator, 

but it's a much bigger chunk of the income of the poor family.

	<p>Despite all the screaming and yelling, the progressive income tax is 

the fairest form of taxation ever invented (unless you want to count the 

wealth tax used by most European countries). When Dwight Eisenhower 

left office, the highest marginal tax rate was 95 percent and no one 

thought Ike was a communist. It's now down to 38.6 percent and due to drop 

to 35 percent. For 70 years, the income tax has made at least part of 

the total tax picture here progressive, rather than regressive. It's not only 

unfair to change that, it's stupid.

	<p>Bush is now arguing that we need a tax cut because the economy is in 

recession.  Originally, he argued for a tax cut because the economy was 

so good. It is true that a balanced budget is not the be-all and 

end-all of good governance -- that's one of those panaceas we occasionally 

fall for -- and running a deficit at the federal level is not the end of 

the world or necessarily even bad policy. Tax cuts can stimulate the 

economy. But note the long, circuitous thinking about giving tax cuts to 

the rich: If the rich have more money, they will invest it -- and that 

investment will allow companies to expand, and then they will hire more 

workers, and that will end the recession. Whereas, if you give tax cuts 

to the middle and working classes, they go out and spend the money 

because the baby needs new shoes. Presto, demand is up, factories back in 

action, end of recession.

	<p>There's no guarantee that rich people will do anything economically 

productive with more money. Their major strategy seems to be stashing it 

in offshore banks so they don't have to pay any taxes. As Leona 

Helmsley so famously remarked, taxes are for "little people." The dirty little 

secret about taxes in this country is that rich people and corporations 

mostly don't pay them now -- they have a whole system of shelters and 

offshore deals. We don't need to raise taxes in this country, we need to 

collect them.

	<p>The centerpiece of the Bush tax cuts is eliminating dividend taxes, 

effective immediately, on the grounds that the dividends are "taxed 

twice" -- by the corporate income tax and then the dividend tax. This one 

has absolutely nothing to do with economic stimulus, it's a pure 

give-away to the rich. 

	<p>One reason dividends should be taxed is because the people who get 

them don't work for the money. In the old days, people who lived off their 

investments were known as "coupon clippers" and generally despised as 

non-working parasites. Granted, it takes some smarts to do well enough 

in the stock market to live high (and somebody, like your granddaddy, 

had to make the money in the first place), but the fact is most investors 

don't spend their lives poring over company prospectuses -- they pay 

someone else to do it. They're making money off other people's labor. Why 

shouldn't they pay taxes on it?

	<p>The final reason it's dumb to cut taxes for the rich is the problem of 

social justice. We're already in trouble because the income gap between 

the rich and the rest of us keeps getting worse and worse. The rich buy 

their way out of our public institutions -- schools, hospitals, parks 

-- and then contribute money to politicians who let the public 

infrastructure go to hell. It doesn't work.<p align="center">&copy; 2003 Creators Syndicate</p>
