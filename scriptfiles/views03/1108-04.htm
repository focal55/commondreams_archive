<p>One of President Bush's first acts was to convene a task force to produce a 
national energy strategy. Led by Vice President Dick Cheney, the group met secretly 
with hundreds of witnesses. It heard from few environmentalists, but many lobbyists 
and executives from industries whose fortunes would be affected by any new policies. 
Despite lawsuits, the White House has refused to divulge the names of those privileged 
to get Mr. Cheney's ear. The results, however, have been plain as day: policies 
that broadly favor industry — including big campaign contributors — at the expense 
of the environment and public health. <p>That unfortunate bias was demonstrated 
anew this week when the Environmental Protection Agency decided to drop investigations 
into more than 140 power plants, refineries and other industrial sites suspected 
of violating the Clean Air Act. The winner is industry; the loser, the public. 
<p>The administration had already weakened the cases' legal foundation: a provision 
in the act that required companies to install up-to-date pollution controls whenever 
they increased harmful emissions by making major upgrades to their plants. The 
utilities had complained that the rule kept them from producing more power and 
discouraged investments in energy efficiency. Though the companies produced no 
convincing evidence, Mr. Cheney's task force swallowed the argument whole, and 
in due course it forced Christie Whitman, then head of the E.P.A., to jettison 
the rule in favor of a more permissive regime allowing companies to increase pollution 
without paying for new controls. <p>The administration insists lamely that a handful 
of cases in litigation will be pursued. It seems clear, however, that the many 
investigations that have not reached litigation will be dropped altogether or 
at best restarted under the new rules — rules so full of loopholes that it is 
highly unlikely that anybody will ever be found to have violated them. <p>The 
administration swore to Congress months ago that this would not happen, that all 
the old investigations would be aggressively pursued under the old rules. So in 
addition to another rollback of environmental law, we have here another depressing 
example of official mendacity. Abandoning these cases is also deeply unfair to 
the companies that have already installed pollution controls in a good-faith effort 
to comply with the law. <p>As is so often the case these days, the burden of defending 
the environment now falls to the states. Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney 
general who has aggressively used the old rules to reduce pollution from power 
plants, has joined other states in suing the E.P.A. for weakening the law. He 
has also asked the E.P.A. to turn its files over to the states so they can pursue 
violators on their own. Finally, some in Congress are calling for an investigation 
into the administration's behavior. And why not? Congress has a right to be unhappy 
with a regulatory and judicial retreat that undermines much of what the Clean 
Air Act stands for. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company
