<p>It is a pleasure and honor to join you this afternoon at the National 

              Press Club. I have enjoyed listening to the broadcasts of this luncheon 

              series for years on Maine Public Radio&#8212;I have been known to 

              schedule my drive time so that I will have a chance to listen to 

              the broadcast uninterrupted. I appreciate being asked to be on this 

              side of the microphone.</p>

            <p>I am speaking today in my capacity of National Director of Win 

              Without War, a coalition of 40 national membership-based organizations 

              including the NAACP, the National Council of Churches, the Sierra 

              Club, the National Organization of Women, Veterans for Common Sense, 

              to name but a few. While these organizations have diverse memberships 

              and missions, we were united late last fall by a sense of great 

              urgency to do everything possible to stop our government from launching 

              a war that we were convinced was unnecessary, illegal and that would 

              leave our nation and our world less secure. Despite the remarkable 

              and unprecedented expression of public opposition in this country 

              and around the world, nothing, it turns out, was going to deter 

              the Bush administration from invading and occupying Iraq. </p>

            <p>A vital citizens movement capable of exposing the dangers of the 

              administration&#8217;s drive toward a world military empire is needed 

              now more than ever. The mission of the Win Without War coalition 

              is to defeat this administration&#8217;s policy of unilateral, preemptive 

              war and its rejection of international cooperation, international 

              law and the institutions that make the international rule of law 

              possible. In short, we need to everything within our power to bury 

              the Bush doctrine in Iraq. A small group within the administration 

              has staged a silent coup and is reshaping America&#8217;s role in 

              the world in radical ways that will severely threaten US and global 

              security. And the sad truth is that Congress has largely abdicated 

              its critical role as a check on executive power and a guardian of 

              the public welfare in matters of war and peace. </p>

            <p>One of the first responsibilities of our coalition&#8212;and, I 

              must say, the media&#8212;must be to provide the American people 

              with the information and analysis necessary to give them a complete 

              and honest picture of what is happening in Iraq and its implications 

              for our country and the world. Despite the much-touted successes 

              of the military invasion, the costs and risks of this war remain 

              enormous, and there is no reason to believe the US is any more secure 

              now than it was before. </p>

            <p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8212;who among us is not relieved at 

              the downfall of a brutal tyrant and the end of his stranglehold 

              on a nation of millions? It goes without saying that the Iraqi people, 

              and the world, are better off without Saddam Hussein. Not surprisingly, 

              many Iraqis are overjoyed at the prospect of an end to decades of 

              oppression, 12 years of sanctions and weeks of heavy bombardment.</p>

            <p>Of course, the outcome of the military invasion of Iraq was never 

              in doubt. As we said repeatedly in the weeks leading to the invasion, 

              it is easy to predict the outcome of a military confrontation between 

              the most powerful military in the history of the world and a weak 

              and impoverished nation with a defense budget less than one percent 

              of our own. </p>

            <p>But it would be a mistake to confuse the current mood in Iraq with 

              enthusiasm for the foreign occupation now being imposed, or to ignore 

              the abundant indications that Iraq is descending into a pit of lawlessness, 

              sectarian fighting, and on-going humanitarian crises. Just as it 

              would be a mistake to conclude that the apparent ease with which 

              the US and Britain blasted its way through Iraq strengthened the 

              case for this unnecessary war or obviated its disastrous implications 

              for US and world security. </p>

            <p>Most worrisome of all is that the hawks in the Bush Administration 

              will now proceed to the next phase of their program, and think that 

              it can turn its guns on Iran, or Syria or N. Korea. The US war against 

              Iraq is in many ways a trial run to establish what this administration 

              calls a &#8220;new norm&#8221; in international relations. This 

              new norm is the doctrine of preventive war that the Administration 

              announced explicitly in its National Security Strategy last fall 

              and which it has expounded on since. It holds that the US has the 

              right to attack any country that it claims to be a potential threat&#8212;not 

              an actual threat, nor an imminent threatbut a potential threat. 

              The new strategy stresses offensive military intervention, preemptive 

              first strikes, and proactive counter proliferation measures against 

              so-called rogue states and other enemies. By rejecting the notion 

              of working within international law, as well as the policies of 

              deterrence and collective security, the Bush Administration is pursuing 

              a vision in which the U.S. is not only the world&#8217;s policeman, 

              but also the world&#8217;s military dictator, answerable only to 

              itself. </p>

            <p>Americans have the right to know the answer to the question&#8212;Does 

              the invasion of Iraq and this &#8220;new norm&#8221; of the Bush 

              national security strategy, make America safer? </p>

            <p>Let&#8217;s start with the lessons that other nations, including 

              those we call the &#8220;axis of evil&#8221;, will take from the 

              trial run of the &#8220;new norm&#8221; in international relations&#8212;the 

              invasion and occupation of Iraq. The administration believes that 

              it will serve as a cautionary tale&#8212;one false move and you 

              will suffer the fate of the Iraqi leadership. Well, the fact is 

              that it is just as likely, if not more likely, that it could have 

              precisely the opposite affect. So called rogue states could very 

              likely conclude that they had better develop nuclear weapons, or 

              other weapons of mass destruction immediately, or they&#8217;ll 

              be vulnerable to a United States preventive war. </p>

            <p>This is what the North Korea&#8217;s foreign ministry had to say 

              last week: &#8220;To allow disarmament through inspections does 

              not help avert a war, but rather sparks it.&#8221; The statement 

              concludes, with unerring logic, that &#8220;only a tremendous military 

              deterrent force&#8221; can prevent attacks on states the US dislikes. 

              Meanwhile, the Iranian nuclear program continues to speed ahead. 

              Does this make America and the world safer?</p>

            <p>And what if the doctrine of pre-emption&#8212;that holds that one 

              nation can attack another if it believes that the other nation poses 

              a potential threat to it&#8217;s security&#8212;is embraced by bitter 

              enemies with their fingers on the trigger of nuclear weapons, like 

              India and Pakistan. What if it is embraced by North Korea? Does 

              this make America and the world safer?</p>

            <p>The fact is that the administration will find that N. Korea with 

              its massive arsenal pointed at Seoul is not such easy prey for US 

              military might. And it will find that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program 

              cannot be stopped by attacking its facilities&#8212;many of which 

              we can&#8217;t even locate&#8212;and that there is no chance that 

              Iranians would welcome US troops as liberators. </p>

            <p>The Bush doctrine rests on two unrealistic and simplistic notions: 

              that the world will welcome US domination because they say to themselves 

              &#8220;they&#8217;re the good guys&#8221; and that the American 

              public will accept the costs and risks of an American military empire 

              and US as world cop. The cost part of this equation is particularly 

              relevant to be asking on the 15th of April.</p>

            <p>Before the invasion of Iraq the administration was reluctant to 

              discuss what the invasion would lead to&#8212;a full-scale occupation 

              for an indeterminate amount of time at an indeterminate cost. Nor 

              was it willing to talk about the fact that, unlike the first Gulf 

              War&#8212;that was sanctioned by the UN Security Council and where 

              90% of its costs were paid by our allies&#8212;the American people 

              will have to shoulder the full burden of the invasion and occupation 

              of Iraq. The administration has now proposed that Congress pay for 

              the $75 billion down payment for this adventure by tacking it onto 

              a federal deficit already heading to the $400 billion dollar mark 

              while cutting vitally important investments here at home.</p>

            <p>Fed on a steady diet of pictures of cheering Iraqi crowds and young 

              American soldiers riding high in tanks and Humvees, Americans savor 

              the taste of victory and feel genuine relief that many nightmare 

              scenarios were avoided. But these pictures show only a part of the 

              story and cannot change the reality that this war was avoidable 

              and leaves the US, and the world, less secure than before. </p>

            <p>President Bush took our nation to war on the basis of two specious 

              arguments: One claim was that this war was necessary to rid Iraq 

              of its weapons of mass destruction. The President and his administration 

              told the American people repeatedly about Iraq&#8217;s vast weapons 

              programs, with thousands of tons of chemical and biological weapons 

              that could kill millions of people. US and British forces now occupy 

              the entire country. They have so far failed to turn up any evidence 

              of any chemical or biological weapons, let alone massive programs. 

              The Iraqi regimes&#8217; failure to use any such weapons, even at 

              the point of its own destruction, argues that either they do not 

              have any usable biological or chemical weapons or they concluded 

              their use would be ineffective. Whatever the reality, it demonstrates 

              that a tough inspection regime given time and resources could have 

              adequately addressed the threat posed by Iraq&#8217;s weapons programs. 

            </p>

            <p>The second claim was that the US was combating terrorism by overthrowing 

              Saddam Hussein and occupying the country. Iraq and 9/11 were repeatedly 

              spoken of in virtually the same breath by the President and his 

              administration. American soldiers reportedly inscribed the names 

              of 9/11 victims on the missiles and bombs they launched against 

              hapless Iraqi conscripts, buildings, homes, and marketplaces. </p>

            <p>I would like to read you a quote from a <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0414-03.htm">mother of Capt. Tristan 

              Aitken</a>, a US soldier who lost his life eleven days ago in Iraq: 

              &#8220;He was doing his job. He had no choice, and I&#8217;m proud 

              of who he was. But it makes me mad that this whole war was sold 

              to the American public and to the soldiers as something it wasn&#8217;t. 

              Our forces have been convinced that Iraqis were responsible for 

              September 11, and that&#8217;s not true.&#8221;</p>

            <p>She&#8217;s right. But, it is important to ask&#8212;Why, according 

              to opinion polls, more than 50% of the American public believes 

              something that is, in fact, untrue&#8212;that Iraq was to blame 

              for the World Trade Center attacks on September 11 2001? No one 

              else in the world believes this. Only Americans. </p>

            <p>Given the administration&#8217;s &#8220;new norm&#8221; of military 

              intervention and preemptive first strikes, this question becomes 

              critical&#8212;the most important decision that a government can 

              make&#8212;the life and death decision of war and peace&#8212;cannot 

              be allowed to be based on a fiction.</p>

            <p>Perhaps some found comfort or satisfaction in the belief that the 

              US was responding to the evil of 9/11. But we should not be deluded 

              into thinking that we have struck a blow against terrorism. The 

              connection between the Iraqi regime and current terrorist activity 

              was tenuous at best. It is well documented that the plan for &#8220;regime 

              change&#8221; in Iraq pre-dated 9/11. The attacks that day provided 

              a political opening to push the Bush administration&#8217;s new 

              strategy. </p>

            <p>The fact of the matter is genuine progress against the international 

              terrorism has been made possible not by the Bush Doctrine, but by 

              international cooperation and coordination. The proof can be found 

              in the successful campaign to track down and capture key al Qaeda 

              operatives. Indeed, European governments, Pakistan and others are 

              responsible for the most significant achievements in apprehending 

              suspected terrorists and disrupting their plans. The fact is that 

              the battle against terrorism cannot be waged effectively without 

              intelligence from our countries, international law enforcement operations, 

              and worldwide coordination to shut down financial support that flows 

              to the terrorists. Alienating the international community and building 

              resentment with a go-it-alone foreign policy threatens what we know 

              works to rein in terrorism and keep Americans and the world, safer. 

            </p>

            <p>While Arabs do not mourn Saddam&#8217;s passing, they do not welcome 

              occupation of a sovereign Islamic state by a western military power. 

              As expected, the war has caused an upsurge in anti-American sentiment 

              in the Middle East&#8212;and around the world. Al Qaeda was created 

              and became empowered by the US presence in Saudi Arabia following 

              the first Gulf War. What new networks will be spawned in reaction 

              to the US presence in Iraq? What can we expect from the tens of 

              thousands of Iraqi children whose parents or siblings were killed 

              by their so-called liberators? Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, a 

              friend of the US, predicted last week that this war will produce 

              &#8220;a hundred [Osama] bin Ladens.&#8221; </p>

            <p>The Administration has brought about regime change as promised. 

              But the world will be watching to judge their performance in fulfilling 

              its far more demanding promises: promises to rebuild the cities 

              we&#8217;ve just destroyed, restore order in the chaos of the vacuum 

              we created, meet the pressing, overwhelming, humanitarian needs, 

              and promote democracy, not just in Iraq, but in the region. It is 

              obvious to us that a lead role for the UN and outside relief agencies 

              in reconstruction is required if this effort is to be seen as legitimate. 

              Just as it is obvious that the President&#8217;s words will ring 

              hollow if the US anoints Iraq&#8217;s next leaders, or continues 

              unabated its support for autocratic regimes throughout the Middle 

              East, or most significantly, does not promptly make genuine and 

              sustained efforts to promote a just peace between Israel and the 

              Palestinians. </p>

            <p>Recent developments are not encouraging. The decision to run Iraq 

              out of the Pentagon, complete with the handing out of no-bid contracts 

              to politically connected firms like Halliburton, undermines US claims 

              that we are nation builders, not occupiers. The fact that many humanitarian 

              organizations will not operate under US military command will delay 

              getting desperately needed humanitarian aid to the suffering people 

              of Iraq. And how will any Iraqi government&#8212;even an interim 

              one&#8212;be able to gain the authority and legitimacy that it will 

              need, if it is brought to power by being anointed exclusively by 

              the United States?</p>

            <p>One the tasks of the anti-war movement is to keep the spotlight 

              on the US&#8217;s obligations as an occupying power. Its track record 

              is not promising. A year and a half after the cheering in Kabul 

              has died down, rival warlords are back ruling most of Afghanistan 

              with widespread torture, Taliban-style repression, and rampant lawlessness. 

            </p>

            <p>Those of us who opposed the war on Iraq have a tough and critical 

              job to do. With a Congress that has abdicated its responsibility 

              to provide checks and balances to the administration, and the UN 

              having been cast aside, Win Without War and the citizens&#8217; 

              movement of this country is more important than ever. And so is 

              the press. Unless the media is able and willing to challenge the 

              administration&#8217;s spin and manipulation of facts, Americans 

              may find themselves at war again. We are talking about future wars 

              that are avoidable, that fuel terrorism, that isolate us from historic 

              allies&#8212;whose cooperation we need to fight terrorism effectively&#8212;that 

              undermine the rule of law, that heap enormous costs of the American 

              people alone, that serve as partial justification for the suspension 

              of civil liberties, and that make all Americans less secure.</p>

            <p>Martin Luther King once said, &#8220;I do not believe our nation 

              can be a moral leader of justice, equality, and democracy if it 

              is trapped in the role of a self-appointed world policeman.&#8221; 

              We are committed to doing everything in our power to help our country 

              avoid that trap. </p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
