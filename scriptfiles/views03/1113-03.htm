<p>LOOK UP at the sky. Imagine space-based weapons orbiting the globe, 
ready to zap or nuke any country declared an imminent threat to the United 
States. 
<P>No, this is not science fiction. It is Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld's vision of global domination. 
<P>Before he headed the Pentagon, Rumsfeld was chairman of the Commission to 
Assess U.S. National Security Space Management Organization. In its final 
report, submitted to Congress on Jan. 11, 2001, it warned, "If the United 
States is to avoid a 'Space Pearl Harbor,' it needs to take seriously the 
possibility of an attack on U.S. space systems." The commission recommended 
the creation of a U.S. Space Corps that would defend our space-based "military 
capability." 
<P>Rumsfeld's report was actually a tamer version of an earlier Department 
of Defense Space Command document  --  "Vision for 2020" --  that, on its Web 
site, showed laser weapons shooting deadly beams from space, zapping targets 
on Earth. Beneath this sci-fi image crawled the words "U.S. Space Command 
dominating the space dimension of military operations to protect U.S. 
interests and investments." 
<P>"Vision for 2020" rightly predicted that the global economy would widen 
the gap between "the haves" and "the have-nots." By deploying space 
surveillance and weaponry, the United States would have the ability "to 
control space," and, from this higher ground, "to dominate" the Earth below. 
<P>By appointing Rumsfeld as his defense secretary, President Bush chose a 
man whom the Washington Post described as "the leading proponent not only of 
national missile defenses, but also of U.S. efforts to take control of outer 
space."
<P>Since then, the Air Force Space Command has issued a progress report, 
"Strategic Master Plan FY04 and Beyond (SMP)," which puts forth the U.S. 
intention to dominate the world by turning space into a crucial battlefield.
<P>In the introduction, Gen. Lance W. Lord proudly writes, "As guardian of 
the High Frontier, Air Force Space Command has the vision and people to ensure 
the United States achieves space superiority today and in the future. A new 
space corps will fight from and in space."
<P>"Space," according to the SMP, "is the ultimate high ground of military 
operations . . . . Our vision calls for prompt global-strike systems with the 
capability to directly apply force from or through space against terrestrial 
targets. Space superiority is essential to our vision of controlling and fully 
exploiting space to provide our military with an asymmetric advantage over our 
adversaries." 
<P>The immediate goal, according to the SMP, is to prevent anyone else from 
launching space-based weaponry. To dominate the globe, the United States must 
dominate outer space. 
<P>Clearly, this space-based vision is useless against terrorist attacks in 
Iraq or Afghanistan. China, however, believes it is the unnamed enemy who 
might be the target of this country's newly articulated policies of pre-
emptive war and global supremacy. 
<P>Last September, China fought hard at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament 
in Geneva for an agreement that would prevent an arms race in outer space. The 
Bush administration, as usual, insisted that an international treaty was 
unnecessary. 
<P>Rumsfeld's dream is dangerous. It not only violates the 1967 Outer Space 
Treaty, which wisely prohibited the militarization of space, but also 
threatens to reignite the arms race, this time in space. It is also hugely 
expensive, costing hundreds of billions of dollars that could be used to care 
for people who live right here on Earth.
<P>Look up at the heavens. Do we really want to leave future generations 
with a legacy of space-based warfare? If not, let's pressure every 
presidential candidate, as well as President Bush, to keep the heavens free of 
weapons of mass destruction.</p>
