<p>Sandra Day O'Connor deserves a lot of praise today.


<p>The first woman ever to sit on the Supreme Court, this centrist justice has throughout her career managed to find a way to uphold important precedents that her more conservative colleagues were all too ready to jettison.


<p>She has previously done so on the issue of abortion, and she now has done so on the issue of affirmative action.


<p>By providing the decisive vote in favor of affirmative action in the Michigan Law School case, she preserved this important tool.


<p>She recognized, as did her four more liberal colleagues, that affirmative action is valid not only to overcome past discrimination but to foster diversity in education.


<p>"Student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions," she wrote.


<p>While she voted to throw out Michigan's undergraduate affirmative action program for being too "mechanical" and not based on an individualized review of applicants, she and the court's majority made it clear that schools could tailor their affirmative action programs in such a way as to pass muster with this court.


<p>Specified percentages based on race are a no-no. Assigning a set number of points for minority applicants, as Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy did, is also verboten. But a university that uses an admissions policy that looks at "each and every applicant" on an individual basis can still give minorities a "plus" to achieve diversity.


<p>That's a perfectly reasonable outcome. Michigan's undergraduate admissions program was crudely drawn, though I believed defensible. But a more individualized selection process is certainly preferable.


<p>So for the time being, affirmative action lives on. This decision should help the country withstand the racial assaults from the right, and it should foster a richer, more tolerant society not only in universities, but in the work world, as well.


<p>Doors remain shut to minorities in this country because of racism. Sandra Day O'Connor has preserved one key to unlocking some of those doors.


<p>Hers was a judicious decision.
