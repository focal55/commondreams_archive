<p>This is the story about the president who cried wolf, and marched to war armed with information that was "darn good."

<p>Not good enough, darn it.

<p>The latest news suggests President Bush manipulated info to justify the invasion of Baghdad. U.S. officials insist they got the 4-1-1 from Britain.

<p>So Bush is blaming the Brits. Bush also is blaming George Tenet, the CIA director who had warned the Bush administration about the British claims. Tenet said new data about Iraq obtaining uranium from Niger was shaky.

<p>That didn't stop the Bush war machine from later putting a reference to uranium in the president's State of the Union speech, setting the stage for battle.

<p>But in an eye-popping reversal last week, Tenet took responsibility for the uranium link mentioned in the president's address. Bush declared the matter over and done with. Time to mosey on. No more pesky questions.

<p>Not so fast, pardner.

<p>Our story is missing a hero -- someone, however flawed or despised, who is willing to yell into this hurricane of presidential spin. 

<p>It needs someone like the man who stood next to me the other day in the Central District, waiting to march in a Seattle community parade.

<p>"It's pretty clear the administration has designated Tenet as the guy to fall on his sword and that's phony baloney because U.S. officials knew," the man huffed. "It's pretty clear there was no basis for this war. There was no tie to al-Qaida. No weapons of mass destruction. We haven't found anything. I think it means we've been brought into this war under false pretenses."

<p>Thank you, Congressman Jim McDermott, for having the courage to say it like it is.

<p>You might recall not long ago, before our brave American soldiers followed orders and stormed into Iraq, the Seattle congressman was lampooned as "Baghdad Jim."

<p>McDermott was pilloried as a political buffoon who suggested the war was more about oil than national security. He was deemed a turncoat for showing up in Iraq and saying Bush was not beyond fibbing to justify his role as a bully.

<p>How dare this two-bit congressman from one of the most left-leaning parts of the People's Republic of Seattle question the leader of the Free World?

<p>But looking back, McDermott was, for once, spot on. He raised questions that needed to be raised -- and is still raising them.

<p>Baghdad Jim has been vindicated.

<p>What is at stake here goes beyond partisan politics. It has everything to do with our national credibility.

<p>In Britain, Tony Blair is taking a justifiable pounding from a public that feels it was dragooned into an unethical, unjustified conflict. 

<p>Here at home the U.S. media, until recently, were whipped into acquiescent submission. To challenge the president or speak against the war was strident and un-American. You are either with us, as Bush once said, or against us. 

<p>That was how the president dispatched the tumbrels of war. 

<p>Only now the whole thing looks more like the stumbles of war. 

<p>We don't have Saddam. We don't have Osama bin Laden. We don't have much -- other than a few of Saddam's henchmen, hundreds of dead Iraqi civilians and more than 260 American and British casualties -- and for what? Phantom weapons of mass destruction? A dictator still on the loose? Thousands and thousands of Iraqis who want us to pack up and leave?

<p>The truth of what the Bush administration knew about Iraq and when it knew it lies in a pool of murky gray. The issue is not as black and white as Democrat-Republican jousting would lead one to believe. And who knows? Those weapons of mass destruction might very well show up in our lifetime.

<p>But the Bush camp isn't talking straight with the public, which is why McDermott is an opportune Bush-whacker. 

<p>The congressman may not be the most effective lawmaker in Congress. He might not be fulfilling his political potential. He often sounds like a broken, scratchy record.

<p>But McDermott is one of few people in power willing to stand up to Bush -- and that counts for much when it comes to war and soldiers risking their skin for their country.

<p>Before he returned to Seattle last week, McDermott stood on the floor of the House and read the names of soldiers recently killed in guerrilla-style attacks in Iraq.

<p>Back in Seattle, McDermott stared me in the eye and said: "These people died thinking they were defending their country. What happened? Why were they sent out there? These are the questions we need to start asking ourselves. Were we misled?"

<p>You may not like this liberal messenger. You could even hate him. But his message is one we ignore at our own peril.
