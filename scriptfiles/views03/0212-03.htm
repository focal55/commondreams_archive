Simply put, if there is a choice between U.N. blue berets and U.S. Marines as the way to disarm Saddam Hussein and his arsenal, then the choice for Canada is clear &#8212; we must opt for a U.N. solution. <P></P>Rather than surreptitiously tying ourselves to war preparation planning with U.S. forces in the Middle East, Canadian policy-makers should be putting their best minds to work on how to secure full compliance with Security Council decisions under U.N. auspices, not through military invasion. <P></P>The starting point is to take seriously the threats emanating from Iraq. Saddam does retain the potential and likely the will to produce weapons of mass destruction and share them with others, affording a serious risk to his region and many others besides.<P></P> After a four-year lull in inspections, the international community is beginning to understand that an alternative approach is desperately needed. <P></P> For the Iraqi nation, an impending attack would be lethal. <P></P>The crisis would not be confined to Iraq's borders. In a visit to the Middle East last week I heard a cacophony of concerns &#8212; threats of severe economic repercussions, disruption in trade, the social and political ramifications of refugee influxes, to environmental degradation that accompanies conflict. <P></P> A report done by the British wing of International Physicians for the Prevention of War anticipates that a military invasion of Iraq would lead to serious instability in the region: <P></P>"Destabilization and possible regime change in countries neighbouring Iraq are also possible, as well as more terrorist attacks. Global economic crisis may be triggered through trade reduction and soaring oil prices, with particularly devastating consequences for developing countries."<P></P>One major casualty could be the U.N. and its role as the arbiter of peace and security decisions, supplanted by the dominance of one or a few powerful states. <P></P>A U.N. presence was just recently restored in Iraq, yet impatience prevails as certain states are refusing to wait for the outcome. Remarks coming out of Washington and London are quite clear: If U.N. member states are not on board, these states will act unilaterally.<P></P> What will this imply for the future of multilateralism, for U.N. legitimacy and the prospects of international stability. Is there an alternative? <P></P> One place to start is the report of the Canadian-sponsored International Commission on Intervention and Sovereignty entitled <i>Responsibility to Protec</i><i>t</i>, a concept that is being actively promoted around the world by Canadian diplomats.<P></P> The report clearly states, "Every diplomatic and non-military avenue for the prevention or peaceful resolution of the humanitarian crisis must have been explored. The responsibility to react &#8212; with military coercion &#8212; can only be justified when the responsibility to prevent has been fully discharged."<P></P>Applying this threshold to the situation in Iraq, it becomes difficult to argue for military intervention by the U.S. and its deputy sheriffs. <P></P> The decisions for the international community are not one of war vs. passivity, or of military action or do nothing. <P></P>It is how to enhance the already well-established U.N. presence in Iraq to secure stability, democracy and disarmament. <P></P>The decision for the international community should be to determine the appropriate level of U.N. intervention in Iraq.<P></P>The Security Council should through a new resolution substantially strengthen the inspection regime, and authorize a U.N.-mandated military force to ensure Iraq disarms. <P></P>This is the gist of the French and German proposals. <P></P>It is also the recommendation of many serious, thoughtful Americans. <P></P>As early as last summer the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace presented proposals for a more effective inspections regime in Iraq.<P></P>It urged the Security Council to authorize the creation of a military arm strong enough to "force immediate entry into any site at any time with complete security for the inspections team."<P></P>This idea should be adapted to the current situation.<P></P> Inspections backed by a U.N.-authorized force would carry legitimacy and international support. It could avoid American "pre-emptive" action. <P></P>It would be more acceptable to Iraq's neighbours than an all-out war. Public opinion in the region would be less aroused by multilateral inspections and U.N.-supervised disarmament than by a unilateral U.S. invasion.<P></P> It would avoid the questions and uncertainty about post-war Iraq. And it would open up an opportunity to take a serious look at a sanctions regime, with a view to ending the hardship on the Iraqi people and creating some positive incentive for compliance.<P></P>Canada must lend its voice and influence to ensuring that this alternative is given a chance to be heard and discussed at the U.N. and not be dismissed by Washington hawks. <P></P>This is the kind of approach much of the rest of the world expects from us.<P></P> If we behave as though war is inevitable or formulate policy as though it has already occurred, we neglect to search for the types of creative diplomatic solutions that are so desperately needed at a time like this.
