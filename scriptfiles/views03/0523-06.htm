<p>Amid concerns about global instability in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, peace studies programs at U.S. colleges and universities are on the rise. There are now 381 institutes of higher education in the United States with Peace Studies programs - a threefold increase since 1995, according to Simona Sharoni, executive director of the Peace & Justice Studies Association (PJSA). 

<p>"Since 9/11 we've seen a dramatic increase in interest in conflict resolution and peace studies courses," she says. "Students who know that war should be a last resort, not a first one, come to us to learn strategies." 

<p>Many of the association's 400 members report classes at double capacity. Though peace studies are more conducive to small class sizes, Sharoni says, "We don't want to turn students away." 

<p>She estimates several thousand students will graduate this May. And, she says, that doesn't include students who have minors in the subject or who have completed some coursework in the field. 

<p>Depending on the program, students study conflict analysis and transformation, mediation, and nonviolent conflict  resolution to prepare for careers in social work, community organizing, teaching, music and performing arts, counseling and peace activism. Hands-on components can include semesters spent abroad working in social justice programs and community support projects. 

<p>Sharoni was among the first to earn a Ph.D. in conflict analysis and resolution from George Mason University in Virginia - the first university to offer a graduate degree in the field. "In the early '90s when I told people what I was getting a degree in, they looked at me as if I was making it up!" 

<p>Now, a decade later, she says, "The field has established itself among practitioners and academics as a credible course of inquiry." 

<p>Peace Studies was first formalized as a course of study in 1948 at Manchester College, a liberal arts college in northern Indiana affiliated with the Church of the Brethren. 

<p>Ken Brown, director of Peace Studies at Manchester, says that the program's founder, Andrew Cordier, "taught the history of political science here and helped draft the founding charter of the United Nations." After leaving Manchester,  Cordier served many years as executive assistant to U.N. secretaries-general and helped arrange U.N. membership for Manchester as a Non-Governmental Organization - the only college with such status. 

<p>"We need to work at nurturing a culture of peace and that's going to take a lot of work," Brown notes. It's accomplished by giving students a background in nonviolence across the curriculum, he says. "They take environmental philosophy, economics, psychology, sociology, history, and religion and war - not just peace studies specifically. We see to it that history, political science and the natural sciences are all taught from the perspective that we're all in this together. Our perspective has to get bigger." 

<p>Aiding the goal of expanding students' perspectives is the Graduation Pledge Alliance. The voluntary Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility, which was initiated at Humboldt State University in California and has been coordinated at Manchester since 1996, states, "I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work." 

<p>Dr. Neil Wollman, a senior Fellow at Manchester's Peace Studies Institute, coordinates the nationwide program of 130 campuses. "Instituting the pledge gets at the heart of a good education and can benefit society as a whole," Wollman says. "Not only does it remind students of the ethical implications of the knowledge and training they received, but it can help lead to a socially-conscious citizenry and a better world."

<p>While the peace studies field got its start in the so-called "peace churches" - Quaker, Mennonite and Church of the Brethren - it has expanded into the secular academic world. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Georgetown and Columbia have all added conflict resolution to core curriculum and research projects. 

<p>The PJSA and the newly launched H-Peace Listserv, a part of the H-Net international network, offer assistance to any university that wants to establish a Peace Studies program. 

<p>"H-Net is a huge academic resource," says Marian Mollin, founding co-editor of H-Peace. "It's an amazing academic resource of Listservs coordinated through Michigan State University." 

<p>Mollin, assistant professor of history at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va., says H-Peace will help both new and existing programs. "If you're putting a course together you can get a syllabus, search logs of discussions and pose questions to colleagues." 

<p>When Sharoni's office fields an inquiry from educators or students looking to establish a program, "We put them in touch with programs in their area that already have established peace programs and help with a feasibility study to show what it can do for enrollment," she says. 

<p>Despite widespread interest, Sharoni says officials are slow to allocate the necessary funds to hire full-time staff. "I think at faith-based institutions it's easier for faculty to defend the program." But, she says, Peace Studies programs have always been connected with political movements and that makes some administrators uneasy. 

<p>"Nothing we do is controversial but it's being presented as such," she says. "So institutions with a conservative board of governors or president are more reluctant to support existing programs or start new ones." 

<p>From her office at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., Sharoni oversees nearly 50 undergraduate and graduate students, including many involved in the International Solidarity Movement, which advocates for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. "Right now we have people ready to go to the West Bank and Gaza, but we had three ISM people shot [recently], including one, (Evergreen student) Rachel Corrie, who was murdered." 

<p>"We just celebrated her 24th birthday here with her family," she says ruefully. "We sang 'Happy Birthday' and had a birthday cake. 

<p>"I sit here as an educator and think of my responsibility as an educator but think as a mother as well and urge them not to go right now. It's extremely important to do our lobbying work here. I'm concerned about creating jobs where they can work for peace and justice right here," Sharoni says. 

<p>"We have a global movement of people educated about alternatives to war who understand that another world is possible," she says. "I want people to know that getting involved in peace and justice is practical, not naive. It's part of structural change."
