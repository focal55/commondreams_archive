<p>WASHINGTON -- Pardon me, but has anyone noticed the similarity between the recent deceptions by a New York Times reporter and the Bush administration's rationales for invading Iraq?

<p>At the top levels of both the Times and the administration, major reviews are under way over their particular embarrassments. The notable exception is that the Times has admitted that somebody was blowing smoke -- big time, as Vice President Dick Cheney might say.

<p>President Bush continues to talk about links (unproved) between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein and saving the world from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which haven't been found.

<p>Meanwhile, the Central Intelligence Agency investigates whether there was much validity in the "facts" presented by U.S. officials as justification for the invasion.

<p>Although it's abundantly clear now that the president's objective always was "regime change," also known as getting rid of Mr. Hussein, he peddled the al-Qaida link and WMD as the better bet to get the U.N. Security Council to go along. He understood it was not about to sanction a blatant overthrow of a sovereign state, as despised as Mr. Hussein was.

<p>You'll recall how Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, with assurances of an imminent threat from Iraq, laid his considerable personal prestige on the line to squeeze a definitive war-making resolution out of the Security Council. In place of hard intelligence, he presented, among other things, computer-simulated mock-ups of mobile chemical and biological weapons factories to make the case.

<p>The council didn't buy it, and neither did most of the rest of the world, but President Bush, with a hard patriotic sell, got the American public on his side and went ahead. With those WMD so elusive, the administration's pitch now is that the invasion confirmed the Iraqi dictator's bestiality, which we already knew, and that that is enough justification.

<p>The corollary apparently is that it really doesn't matter whether such weapons are ever found. But what about the obligation that Mr. Bush had to level with Congress in insisting that the threat from Iraq was so imminent that its constitutional power to declare war should be ceded to the head of the executive branch?

<p>The Senate's 85-year-old dean, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, is dismissed as a ranting relic when he insists that the Constitution he carries in his coat pocket like a pacemaker continue to be observed and that the United States not use its superpower clout to remake the world in its image.

<p>Mr. Byrd's proposition hardly seems academic in light of reports that the administration is now turning its eye on Iran as the next target of its advocacy of "anticipatory self-defense" justifying pre-emptive war, conducted unilaterally, if necessary.

<p>A warning of an imminent threat from Iranian possession of WMD may well have more validity than the one used to win congressional approval of the Iraq invasion. But the Democrats who were so willing to buy that rationale from Mr. Bush then may be harder to convince the next time around.

<p>Another administration sales pitch for the Iraq invasion was that it would be accepted by the Iraqi people as a "liberation," not an occupation. But that hope has now been dispelled, not only by the unruly behavior of many of the "liberated," but also by the new American czar on the ground, L. Paul Bremer III. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, he was quoted as saying: "Occupation is an ugly word, not one Americans feel comfortable with, but it is a fact."

<p>It will be most interesting to see what the CIA comes up with in its investigation into the quality and assessment of the intelligence used by the administration to persuade Congress and, unsuccessfully, the Security Council to sanction the invasion of Iraq.

<p>If it reveals any intentional misrepresentation by the White House, the State Department or the Pentagon, the whole concept of "anticipatory self-defense" and pre-emptive war will be undermined, and should be.
