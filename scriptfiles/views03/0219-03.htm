<p> Boys, boys, you're all right. Sure, it's Daddy, oil, and imperialism, not 
to mention a messianic sense of righteous purpose, a deep-seated contempt for 
the peace movement, and, to be fair, the irrefutable fact that the world would 
be a better place without Saddam Hussein. 
<p> But there's also an overarching mentality feeding the administration's collective 
delusions, and it can be found by looking to corporate America's bottom line. 
The dots leading from Wall Street to the West Wing situation room are the ones 
that need connecting. There's money to be made in post-war Iraq, and the sooner 
we get the pesky war over with, the sooner we (by which I mean George Bush's corporate 
cronies) can start making it. 
<p> The nugget of truth that former Bush economic guru Lawrence Lindsey let slip 
last fall shortly before he was shoved out the oval office door says it all. Momentarily 
forgetting that he was talking to the press and not his buddies in the White House, 
he admitted: "The successful prosecution of the war would be good for the economy." 
<p> To hell with worldwide protests, an unsupportive Security Council, a diplomatically 
dubious Hans Blix, an Osama giddy at the prospect of a united Arab world, and 
a panicked populace grasping at the very slender reed of duct tape and Saran Wrap 
to protect itself from the inevitable terrorist blow-back -- the business of America 
is still business. 
<p> No one in the administration embodies this bottom line mentality more than 
Dick Cheney. The vice president is one of those ideological purists who never 
let little things like logic, morality, or mass murder interfere with the single-minded 
pursuit of profitability. 
<p> His on-again, off-again relationship with the Butcher of Baghdad is a textbook 
example of what modern moralists condemn as "situational ethics," an extremely 
convenient code that allows you to do what you want when you want and still feel 
good about it in the morning. In the Cheney White House (let's call it what it 
is), anything that can be rationalized is right. 
<p> The two were clearly on the outs back during the Gulf War, when Cheney was 
Secretary of Defense, and the first President Bush dubbed Saddam "Hitler revisited." 
<p> Then Cheney moved to the private sector and suddenly things between him and 
Saddam warmed up considerably. With Cheney in the CEO's seat, Halliburton helped 
Iraq reconstruct its war-torn oil industry with $73 million worth of equipment 
and services -- becoming Baghdad's biggest such supplier. Kinda nice how that 
worked out for the vice-president, really: oversee the destruction of an industry 
that you then profit from by rebuilding. 
<p> When, during the 2000 campaign, Cheney was asked about his company's Iraqi 
escapades, he flat out denied them. But the truth remains: When it came to making 
a buck, Cheney apparently had no qualms about doing business with "Hitler revisited." 
<p> And make no mistake, this wasn't a case of hard-nosed realpolitik -- the rationale 
for Rummy's cuddly overtures to Saddam back in '83 despite his almost daily habit 
of gassing Iranians. That, we were told, was all about "the enemy of my enemy 
is my friend." 
<p> No, Cheney's company chose to do business with Saddam after the rape of Kuwait. 
After Scuds had been fired at Tel Aviv and Riyadh. After American soldiers had 
been sent home from Desert Storm in body bags. 
<p> And in 2000, just months before pocketing his $34 million Halliburton retirement 
package and joining the GOP ticket, Cheney was lobbying for an end to U.N. sanctions 
against Saddam. 
<p> Of course, American businessmen are nothing if not flexible. So his former 
cronies at Halliburton are now at the head of the line of companies expected to 
reap the estimated $2 billion it will take to rebuild Iraq's oil infrastructure 
following Saddam's ouster. This burn-and-build approach to business guarantees 
that there will be a market for Halliburton's services as long as it has a friend 
in high places to periodically carpet bomb a country for it. 
<p> In the meantime, Halliburton, among many other Pentagon contracts, has a lucrative 
10-year deal to provide food services to the Army that comes with no lid on potential 
costs. Lenin once scoffed that "a capitalist would sell rope to his own hangman." 
And, while the man got more than a few things wrong, he's been proven right on 
this one time and time again: from Hewlett-Packard and Bechtel helping arm Saddam 
back in the 80s, to the good folks at Boeing, Hughes Electronics, Lockheed Martin, 
and Loral Space whose corporate greed helped China steal rocket and missile secrets 
-- and point a few dozen long-range nukes our way. 
<p> Clearly, our national interest runs a distant second when pitted against the 
rapacious desires of special interests and the politicians they buy with massive 
campaign contributions. Oil and gas companies donated $26.7 million to Bush and 
his fellow Republicans during the 2000 election and another $18 million in 2002. 
So does it really come as any surprise that Cheney's staff held secret meetings 
in October with executives from Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips -- 
and, yes, Halliburton -- to discuss who would get what in a post-Saddam Iraq? 
As they say, to the victors -- and the big buck donors -- go the sp-oil-s. 
<p> Here's my bottom line: at a time of war, at what point does subverting our 
national security in the name of profitability turn from ugly business into high 
treason? </p>
