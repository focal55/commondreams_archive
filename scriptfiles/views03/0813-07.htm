<p>There is an old adage about borrowing: if
you owe the bank $50,000 and can't pay it, you
have a problem; but if you owe the bank $50
million, then the bank has a problem. This may well
describe the situation facing Argentina and the IMF,
as they try to conclude negotiations for a new
agreement this month.

<p>The pressure on both sides will be intense,
and the outcome could have a serious impact on
future economic policy in Latin America and
developing countries generally. Argentina owes
$14.3 billion to the IMF, $8.5 billion to the World
Bank, and $8 billion to the Inter-American
Development Bank -- respectively, about 14, 8, and
20 percent of these institutions' portfolios. If
Argentina defaults to them, it could jeopardize their
AAA credit rating. In other words, the banks have a
problem.

<p>Aside from the risk of a lower credit rating,
which is probably remote for the IMF, these lenders
could lose enormous political power in the case of a
default. The big three generally negotiate as a block,

and with the IMF as leader. This gives them a
creditors' cartel which is very powerful and allows
them to impose a whole set of economic conditions
on borrowing governments -- often harmful and
sometimes disastrous, as in the case of Argentina in
recent years.

<p>These official or "preferred creditors" have a
trump card that private lenders don't have: if a
country defaults to the IMF or World Bank, they
can be cut off from all kinds of credit, even the
export credits necessary to carry on day-to-day
international trade. That is why very few countries
have ever defaulted to these institutions, and those
that have done so have generally been "failed" or
"pariah" states such as Iraq, Congo, or Afghanistan.
And that is why Argentina has been careful so far to
make its payments to the IMF and World Bank,
even while presiding over the largest sovereign debt
default in history.

<p>But if Argentine President Kirchner calls the
IMF's bluff this time, it's not clear that -- as a
political matter -- the Fund would be able to inflict
more punishment than it has already meted out to
Argentina. Unlike Brazil, whose economy is
currently sagging under the weight of an IMF-
sponsored austerity plan, Argentines have already
suffered through the depths of a crushing economic
collapse. The depression pushed more than half the
population below the official poverty line, and a
fifth of the labor force into unemployment.

<p>Most of Argentina (and the world) knows
quite well that the IMF played a major role in
bringing about this disaster, and in making it worse
by advocating high interest rates and government
budget cuts (the opposite of what our own
government has done since our economy slipped
into recession in 2001). So Kirchner should have a
lot of public support for refusing any agreement that
imposes further suffering or threatens to abort the
economy's nascent recovery.

<p>"Argentina has already proven that it can
live without an IMF agreement," said Kirchner, and
he is right. The IMF gave the country nothing but
grief from August 2001 to January 2003, and then
signed an agreement that only allowed Argentina to
maintain its payments to official creditors -- in other
words, no new resources. But the country is running
a large trade surplus and therefore doesn't
necessarily need financial resources from abroad.
The economy grew by 5.4 percent for the year
ending with the first quarter of 2003.

<p>The current agreement expires at the end of
this month, and Argentina owes more than $6
billion to the official creditors by the end of the
year. The Fund could use the threat of default on
these payments to force an unsustainable settlement
on the $76 billion of defaulted debt owed to private
creditors.

<p>This would be especially dangerous. If
Argentina agrees to pay too much of the defaulted
debt, it could be condemned to an indefinite period
of austerity and stagnation -- limping along from
one crisis to the next, while bondholders fret
whether the government can continuously punish its
citizens enough to extract increasing government
budget surpluses.

<p>Meanwhile, the Fund has had the bad taste
to insist on punishing price increases for the
privatized, foreign-owned utility companies, and
foreclosures on homes bought by ordinary citizens
who were bankrupted when the IMF-sponsored
exchange rate regime collapsed. Let's hope that the
Argentine government can hold its ground -- it
certainly has a mandate to do so.
