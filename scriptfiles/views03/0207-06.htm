<p>Going to the Palestinian Territories occupied by Israel for my winter vacation, I never dreamed that I'd be playing bingo. Arriving at a muddy roadblock, I saw 20 Palestinian men crouching in the rain. The Israeli soldiers were taking their time checking every Palestinian ID by telephone. </p>
<p>Occasionally, the soldiers allowed one or two people who approached the roadblock to pass through immediately. Unfortunately, this persuaded more Palestinians to venture up to the roadblock. They had little choice but to try; their three villages were cut off from jobs, hospitals and food in the nearby city of Nablus because the Israelis had built a massive roadblock across their only access road, then surrounded the villages with a deep moat.</p>
<p>In four days of roadblock watch, we found that the vast majority of Palestinians, including men, women and the occasional donkey were stopped and held for two to seven hours. </p>
<p>Younger children or very old or sick people were allowed through with minimal hassle. The soldiers explained, "This is a game of Palestinian Bingo: We gather all the IDs and sometimes we have a 'bingo' and find a terrorist."</p>
<p>Palestinian Bingo was a strategy of detaining an entire population, then sifting through to shake out likely suspects. The soldiers insisted that this racial profiling "is justified by the end result" of occasionally catching someone who might bomb children in Tel Aviv. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bingo that first day was our friend Omar, who had been confident that any security check (like those in the past) would reveal that he was not "wanted." But that afternoon, the Israeli police said he was wanted (true, or a lie to punish us?) and arrested him. Omar's whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<p>We visitors from England, the United States and Japan were joining the International Solidarity Movement to End the Occupation because we believed in nonviolence and justice for both Palestinians and Israelis. </p>
<p>Palestinians welcomed us to the roadblock, saying our presence ensured that no one would be beaten or shot. They said we prevented humiliations such as being made to kneel in rainwater. However, they also said that sometimes their punishment was doubled after we left; we promised not to abandon places we began to help.</p>
<p>We witnessed various power games. One captain admitted he had hit Palestinians and he seemed most rigid about making the detained men squat silently, handcuffing any who attempted to speak. Late one night, only one detainee was left but a captain would not let him go. The captain told us "because of you. You push too much. If not for you, this man would be gone." We had pushed our political discussion too far; this last detainee had paid the price.</p>
<p>Would it help if we stepped back? He nodded and we stepped away. Minutes later, this last detainee was freed. </p>
<p>It was heartening to watch Palestinians approach soldiers as human beings. 'Assem, a high school counselor, spoke to the soldiers: "Tell me, human to human, what is the solution? Our village is cut off; our people are hungry, our animals are starving, we cannot get to our jobs, the hospital. What's the solution? If you tell me, I'll try to do it. Tell me, not as a soldier, but as a human, what should we do?" </p>
<p>Haithem, another Palestinian, said: "I didn't try to sneak across the fields or climb over some mountain. I came to you, to this checkpoint. Please, let me go to my job in Nablus, or let me go home to care for my two girls."</p>
<p>Every day that a Palestinian survives is a day of non-violent resistance to the occupation, an occupation trying to make Palestinians give up. Some soldiers were kind. One allowed Palestinians to complete unloading animal feed across the roadblock while the police checked IDs. Others allowed the detainees to build a fire, gave a canteen of water to a Muslim for prayer, and allowed some women to pass the roadblock without security checks. </p>
<p>Late each afternoon, the IDs that took "so long" to check were returned, whether they'd been taken seven hours or one hour before. Were the soldiers tired of standing in the rain, guarding girls and soggy donkeys, or tired of us and our calls to human rights organization?</p>
<p>The only clear fact was that it didn't take a long time to check IDs; if the soldiers only wanted to check them, the process could take less than 10 minutes per person. Even though one captain claimed he was not doing this to "humiliate," that he was "just following orders," his Palestinian Bingo game was collectively humiliating.</p>
<p>And it was starving the people of three small villages -- a group of courageous people retaining dignity and community while trying to survive.</p>
