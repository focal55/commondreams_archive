<p>On streets of beauty, the warm people inched along or stood 
      and chanted and laughed against a war and for peace and their warmth made 
      the winter temperature irrelevant.<p>They were summer people in 
      winter clothes.<p>They were the largest and happiest crowd seen in 
      this city maybe ever, outside of a war's end in 1945.<p>There were 
      fathers with children on their shoulders. There were mothers holding their 
      young. There were kids walking alongside their parents. There were 
      religious people everywhere.<p>And so many were young. Young 
      students, young married, young in a city that belonged to the dreams and 
      love and laughter of youth.<p>Do you want a life with thrills, years 
      of exhilaration? Come to New York.<p>Where yesterday they said they 
      did not want war.<p>They said it with their presence and with the 
      most signs of my time in my city. The signs were against war, and against 
      George W. Bush, who, for the first time, was being heralded as a man who 
      lost the popular vote in this country by 500,000.<p>Looking down 
      Third Avenue and Second Avenue, as the crowds came up to try to get to the 
      rear of the great crowd on First Avenue, and then peering as far down 
      First Avenue as you could see, the size of throngs caused you to tell 
      yourself, "maybe a million.&#8221; Whatever it was, out on the street it felt 
      like a million, and it was glorious. A news photographer I know came 
      along. "I've been everyplace. I have to say a million.&#8221; Because of the 
      Police Department's reprehensible pens, the crowd was separated so that 
      there was not one clear picture of an enormous group that would cause 
      politicians here to faint.<p>The crowd so frightening was made of 
      people who mostly never had protested before, who were too young for the 
      Vietnam protests and who cannot be classified under any of the old words, 
      "demonstrators&#8221; or "anti-war,&#8221; because they are new and they are 
      real.<p>War may be a great favorite with a Texas Theocracy, with a 
      president who speaks in the first person more than anybody we have had in 
      decades -- "I'm sick and tired of waiting&#8221; -- and who calls on God to 
      bless the country as if no other people made in the image and likeness of 
      God are alive on earth.<p>Only the sour people could permit innocent 
      people to be scared as close to death as you could do it. "Get duct tape!&#8221; 
      her government told Kristin, a friend of mine who lives in Washington. So 
      she went out and got duct tape, which usually is mentioned in stories 
      about bank robbers using it to bound and gag clerks.<p>Kristin taped 
      the windows and door of her children's room. She then said she was ready 
      for a gas attack. She failed to realize that the attack would leave her 
      kids as orphans.<p>The crowd yesterday was herded into a mile of 
      pens, like the Omaha stockyards. This was for security. The reason for 
      security was security.<p>On our streets of beauty yesterday, gladness 
      was in the place of arrogance and meanness. The sole conflict I found, 
      when I arrived at 66th Street and First Avenue, the closest I could get to 
      the stage at 51th Street, a young woman named Leslie Meenan was holding 
      the hand of a girl who said her name was, as I spelled it, Camilla. She 
      was 8.<p>"You're spelling it wrong,&#8221; she said. "Only one 
      &#8216;l.'&#8221;<p>"You don't know how to spell your own name,&#8221; I 
      said.<p>"Yes, I do. You don't.&#8221;<p>"She's right,&#8221; a woman said. 
      Her name was Cara McCarthy and she was from Bushwick, in Brooklyn. She 
      teaches at PS 145.<p>Just ahead was Bob Stratton, who held his 
      daughter, Fia, age 3. He said he was from Park Slope and he was in 
      computer development.<p>And now as you walked along the edge of one 
      of these pens, here was a line of Catholic protests and then a group of 
      schoolteachers and then everything seemed to be Jane Burcaw, in a good, 
      warm and fashionable hat holding a sign that said, "No War.&#8221;<p>"I 
      made it last night,&#8221; she said.<p>"Where do you 
      live?&#8221;<p>"Bethlehem. I work at the Moravian Theological Seminary. I 
      got here at 10:30. I would've been much earlier if I had to.&#8221;<p>The 
      number of police and vehicles was unconscionable in this area, blocks away 
      from the stage. The people were beautiful and the overload of police was 
      irritating and deprived people of their rights.<p>Somewhere far 
      downtown from where I was standing, they had police horses on Second 
      Avenue and people there to protest were behind the endless metal pens and 
      somewhere the cattle turned human and people were arrested.<p>The 
      mayor of this city and the police commissioner had been spreading fear in 
      this city for many days. Their claims were infuriating. "We know there is 
      something coming but we can't tell you.&#8221; If they knew it was coming and 
      the people who were doing it knew it was coming, then what are you keeping 
      a secret for?<p>Bet me that they had the same kind of rumor that 
      Colin Powell tried to sell at the UN, and on Friday he got carried out on 
      a shutter.<p>But this was only passing. What went on yesterday was an 
      enormous crowd that turned cold sidewalks into beautiful 
      gardens.<p>They were the nicest people I've ever been with.
