<p>The Girls' Schools Association and the Confederation of British Industry may seem as different as chalk and cheese, but as the former's conference ends and the latter's begins, it is more obvious than ever that they are linked by the same question. 
<p>How far are we are prepared to allow every nook and cranny of our society to be governed by the values of the market? How far are we prepared to allow the view that every relationship is essentially transactional, only valid and efficient if it suits our self-interest? And how far are we prepared to allow that the values that govern social relationships - trust, empathy, mutual regard, altruism, conscience - are economically inefficient and thus second rate?  
<p>It was Mary Steel, headmistress of St Mary and St Anne, a private school in Staffordshire which charges its boarders &#163;16,899 a year, who set the cat among the pigeons at the GSA conference last week. Depending on the very wealthy to provide her income, she none the less deplored the values-vacuum they had created for their children.  
<p>'Everyone in society now only seems to be concerned with their own achievements and ambitions,' she declared. 'We are in danger of creating a rootless generation.' Parents routinely lied to excuse their children from speech days or sports events if they weren't participating; there was no loyalty to the school as a social institution or pleasure in the achievements of others.  
<p>She spoke of one father dropping off his three daughters to school by helicopter, girls who had never had a story read to them. His relationship with the school and his daughters was essentially transactional; he wanted to buy the school's values but would not support them with his actions. The signal to his children could not be clearer: invest no time in your relationships or value your school - think only of number one.  
<p>Mary Steel is not alone in her concern. Both the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers have recently warned that the culture of self-interest and self-gratification has invaded every family to a greater or lesser degree. They add that pupils have become less controllable and more prone to violence than ever before, with ever less support from parents in attempting to instill loyalty to social norms or promotion of the common good.  
<p>Even solving the calamity of the school run is close to impossible; parents will not act together to support school buses or public transport. Rather, they continue to act individually, sitting in the gridlock they create, a preference for self over the social that their kids cannot fail to ape.  
<p>Yet tomorrow, at the CBI conference, what will be on parade is the loud assertion that Britain cannot afford concern for the common interest or any initiative that might promote it, so laying an insufferable burden on business. Taxation to fund public services will be denounced as illegitimate, because public services do not, allegedly, match private-sector efficiency. Anyway, choice in markets is better than collectively provided services.  
<p>Regulation of the labor market from the European Union or Whitehall - in this, the least regulated lab our market in the industrialized world - will be portrayed as constraining the necessary autonomy of business if it is to compete. The valiant wealth-creating businessman and woman will be characterized as trying to deliver jobs and prosperity in the face of red tape, statist obstruction and irrational preoccupation with worker rights.  
<p>This has always been the business gripe, but what is different today is this is no longer just one party to the national conversation - it defines the national conversation. Thus, when Digby Jones, the director-general of the CBI, rattles the Government's cage, he does so not merely as a business lobbyist but as a spokesman representing unchallengeable economic truths that rank the highest in the moral league table.  
<p>He speaks in a culture that now accepts that individual self-interest takes priority over the social and that a transactional view of the universe is economically and morally superior to the idea that what counts are relationships and society. He further entrenches, although personally he would deplore them, the values Mary Steel so decries.  
<p>Jones would - if he had more leeway, the wider culture were different and the Government were more self-confident - be party to a more sophisticated exchange over the relationship between economy and society. He has, after all, accommodated the CBI to the minimum wage, and criticizes an education system that still fails so many of its pupils. He refuses to defend excessive rewards for executive failure. He insists on keeping relationships with trade unions alive.  
<p>Business has proper concerns; the question is where to draw the line. Jones is right to make these concessions to the social, partnership and fairness. As an apostle of 'socially inclusive wealth creation', he would go further if he were pushed. The pity is that no one does. The truth is that both wealth generation and the health of our wider society require a much more generous definition of the role of the social than the national conversation acknowledges.  
<p>Even the idea of the company - in its original conception, literally a group of companions who shared a common cause and applied for a licence to trade, accepting social obligations along with the right to make profits - was profoundly rooted in society.  
<p>It is only over the last 20 years that this notion has been abandoned, and 'wealth generation' cast as only possible if companies are the creatures of their shareholders ceaselessly trying to maximize short-term profits in unregulated markets, the maxim of the so-called American Business Model.  
<p>This cannot be allowed to pass as a general principle; not only does it not work in describing how companies actually function, it is too destructive. In television, for example, it is legitimizing, as Roger Mosey, head of BBC TV News said last week, an industry that, with the advent of digitalization and a multiplicity of channels, is delivering a 'poisonous cocktail' of smut and populist crap - and ratchets up by another notch the kind of behavior our school leaders deplore.  
<p>In a market society, who is the fool who champions integrity of purpose, vocation and the importance of values other than self-interest? Should we wonder at how overpaid footballers behave, where relationships with club and even country are seen as transactions on the way to the most important thing of all - personal wealth?  
<p>We have lost our collective compass and are paying a heavy price; the worst of it is that we know it. The tragedy of New Labour is that it has been too frightened to offer the lead we crave. But we get the leadership we deserve. Reform starts in our souls.
