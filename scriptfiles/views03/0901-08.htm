<p>As Americans celebrate Labor Day and honor the nation's working people, 
we should all be ashamed that American labor law and American labor law 
enforcement makes a mockery of workers' basic rights to organize, join 
unions and exercise collective bargaining rights. 

<p>Workers in industry and commerce face enormous obstacles to form a union 
and exercise fundamental rights once unionized. One in ten union 
supporters campaigning to form a union is fired illegally, and employers 
are effectively free to fire ("permanently replace") workers on strike. 

<p>Much of the flawed framework of American labor law is traceable to the 
Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Fifty-six years after its passage, it is time 
for Congress to repeal this denial of workers' civil rights. 

<p>Employers and other forces opposed to unions' right to exist passed 
Taft-Hartley in a climate of fear and anti-union zealotry. The result 
remains a heavily imbalanced labor law, which includes Taft-Hartley 
provisions that: 

<p>* Ban secondary boycotts, severely diminishing the organizing and 
bargaining power of labor unions. 

<p>* Define "employee" to exclude supervisors and independent contractors. 
This diminishes the pool of workers eligible to be unionized. The 
exclusion of supervisors from union organizing activity has meant they 
are used as management's "front line" in anti-organizing efforts. 

<p>* Require the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election to 
determine representation; prior to Taft Hartley, the Board at its 
discretion could certify unions through other means, potentially 
including card-checks. 

<p>* Authorize states to adopt misnamed "right-to-work" laws, barring union 
security clauses. Union security clauses mean all workers in a unionized 
shop who receive the economic benefits of union representation pay dues 
to share the cost of maintaining the union (though they do not have to 
be members and cannot be compelled to support political positions they 
oppose). 

<p>* Permit decertification elections -- enabling employers to maintain 
ongoing campaigns against unions' very existence. 

<p>Strong, vibrant and democratic unions are essential to advance workplace 
safety, to ensure decent conditions of work, to restrain corporate 
employers' exploitative instincts and more broadly to ensure a 
functioning and flourishing democracy. Unfortunately, union 
representation and labor power have steadily declined over the last four 
decades -- with unions now representing only approximately 10 percent of 
the private workforce, the lowest percentage in 60 years. 

<p>More and more workers are toiling in jobs near the minimum wage, in 
non-unionized operations like Wal-Mart, K-Mart and McDonald's. These 
service sector jobs are not inherently low-wage. They are low wage 
because they are non-union. 

<p>The decline in union representation is due to many factors -- including 
unbridled corporate globalization -- but high among them is Taft-Hartley 
and our system of inadequate legal protections for workers. Other 
industrialized countries with more substantial legal protections for 
workers -- such as Canada and countries throughout Western Europe -- 
evidence much higher rates of union membership. 

<p>Repeal of Taft-Hartley should be a priority of every American who 
believes in civil rights, and a top priority of all politicians who 
consider themselves friends of labor. 

<p>Yet of all the announced candidates for President from the two major 
parties, only one, Representative Dennis Kucinich, has expressed a 
willingness to repeal any element of the Taft-Hartley Act. 

<p>To truly honor American workers, the Taft-Hartley Act blemish should be 
removed from our laws.
