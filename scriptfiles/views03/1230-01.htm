<p>So it looks like our Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld was rather friendly with Saddam Hussein
(a.k.a. The Monster) back in the 80s, when Mr.
Rumsfeld was working for the Reagan Administration.
This according to newly de-classified documents that
were never intended to see the light of day.

        <p> Of course Mr. Hussein was "Our Monster" back
then. But still it is rather striking that Rummy's mission
when he met with Saddam Hussein's foreign minister
was to reassure The Monster that his actual use of
weapons of mass destruction -- not mere possession,
but using them to kill tens of thousands of people --
would not get in the way of warmer U.S.-Iraqi relations.
It was 1984 and Saddam was using chemical weapons,
according to the Reagan administration's documents,
"almost daily" against Iranians and Kurds.

      <p>   Mr. Rumsfeld had already met with The
Monster himself back in 1983. He was sent back to Iraq
in 1984 to make it clear that Washington's interests in "continuing to improve bilateral relations with Iraq, at a pace of Iraq's choosing, remain undiminished" in spite of these daily atrocities. These were the written instructions that Rumsfeld received as special envoy of the Reagan Administration.

      <p>   Some may still remember that the main reason
given for our armed forces invading Iraq, in defiance of international law and most of the world, was that Saddam supposedly had weapons of mass destruction. These alleged weapons are still missing in action. But even if they did exist, it is hard to believe -- in light of these documents -- that our leaders took us to war for this reason.

      <p>   The new documents were discovered by the
non-profit National Security Archives
(www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/) and reported last week in
the New York Times and Washington Post. They
corroborate previous reports in the Times that the
United States provided Iraq with battle planning
assistance, and other military and intelligence support,
at the time that Iraq was using chemical weapons in its
war with Iran.

      <p>   Of course, Rumsfeld and his superiors had their reasons. But who doesn't? It is rare that any political leader commits atrocities just for the sheer pleasure of it. In this case Washington and The Monster were strategically allied against Iran. Washington's relationship with Saddam -- including hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural credits -- continued right up to the time that he invaded Kuwait in 1990.

      <p>   But all of this is history, which in America is synonymous with forgotten. Which is why the Bush administration will do everything possible to make sure that Hussein is not brought before an international tribunal, where there is a greater chance that he could implicate some of his former friends and allies in Washington.

      <p>   This is not just a matter of suffering
embarrassment for being friends with monsters. Among
the crimes that Saddam could be tried for is killing
people with chemical weapons. In an honest judicial
proceeding, Rumsfeld and his superiors could be named
and indicted as co-conspirators.

    <p>     Since Saddam's capture we have been told that
the purpose of the ongoing war is to bring democracy to
Iraq, in fact to the whole Middle East. Of course, the
majority of Americans still believe that Saddam was
involved in the massacre of September 11, according to
the latest polls. It seems that no justification is too ridiculous or far-fetched to serve as an excuse for this war.

      <p>   On the same page that the Times reported the
story about Rumsfeld's past mission to Iraq, there was a
little box that appears on most days with the title
"Names of the Dead." It began with the same sentence
that appears each time: "The Department of Defense
has identified 463 American armed service members
who have died since the start of the war." Only the
number changes, and beneath are listed the soldiers
who were killed the day before.

      <p>   Can anyone tell us why we have soldiers dying
in Iraq?
