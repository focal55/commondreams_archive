<p>IN ANY DISCUSSION on the probable conflict in Iraq, people in favor of 

such a war frequently mention Neville Chamberlain at Munich. The lesson of 

Chamberlain's infamous meeting with Hitler is obvious: Appeasement does not 

work with madmen or with dictators. Rather than bringing peace, it only 

promotes a longer and more horrible war.

<P>The analogy is not exact, but it is in the nature of analogies to be 

inexact. But the message is clear enough: Silence or cowardice in the face of 

tyranny is unjustified both morally and practically.

<P>So when a nation announces that it now feels free to act with force against 

perceived threats rather than waiting for actual attacks, we should pay 

attention. We should understand that the leader of the nation is now willing 

to bomb cities and deploy armies whenever and wherever he feels threatened. 

When the leader says he would not need "absolute proof" of the perceived 

threats, we should pay attention. We should not pretend that things are still 

the same when they are not still the same. We should not forget the lesson of 

Munich.

<P>When a regime says it no longer rules out first strikes with nuclear 

weapons, we should do whatever we can to urge our allies to work against such 

a regime. The more powerful a nation is, the larger its armies, the greater 

the need for noise rather than silence, for remembering rather than forgetting, for courage rather than cowardice.

<P>THE LEADER WHOSE policies I have been describing is George W. Bush. The 

lesson of Munich is that it is necessary to speak out against tyranny, no 

matter how dangerous that becomes. It is hard for us to think of our own 

government as the villain; in today's fervid atmosphere, such talk is almost 

treasonous.

<P>We have forgotten that democracy is a dangerous business. Built into the 

Constitution is the notion that a free people should thwart its leaders if 

necessary. This is our duty, the price of our freedom. Leaders hate to be 

thwarted; it is in the nature of power to consolidate itself.

<P>It is clear that the Democrats, the so-called opposition party, are 

unwilling to accept the dangers of democracy. It is clear that the Congress of 

the United States, conceived as a brake on the dangers of an imperial 

presidency, will continue to be a rubber stamp for the Bush imperium. It is 

clear that the Supreme Court will be willing to suspend any civil liberty that 

thwarts the plans of the supreme leader of what is often referred to as "the 

greatest nation on earth."

<P>THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION is working hard to make us forget. It is closing 

down sources of information about its own workings; it is denying citizens 

access to data about the government they theoretically control. It is 

purposely muddying the waters and confusing the issues, deacquisitioning 

enemies when they are no longer useful bogeymen.

<P>Terrorism is not a nation; terrorism is a tactic. The United States has 

used it or condoned its use. There is currently a very real Islamic 

fundamentalist terrorist movement. The United States has an equally real 

obligation to use its power to oppose this movement.

<P>The movement is not controlled from Iraq; there is no evidence that the 

elimination of Saddam Hussein would do anything to hinder that movement. The 

Taliban still move freely along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border; their power 

has been diminished but not eliminated. But we are asked to forget about that, 

even as we are asked to forget about the still-mysterious anthrax attacks that 

occurred less than two years ago.

<P>It is necessary for us to remember; it is necessary for us to speak out. It 

is time to pay attention to the man behind the curtain. There is no greater 

patriotism.
