<p>When Defense Policy Board chairman Richard Perle revealed that he was 

getting $725,000 to help Global Crossing navigate the national security 

issues surrounding the sale of its assets, the press jumped all over 

Perle, and rightly so. There was indeed something fishy about the 

chairman of a board that advises the Pentagon making that kind of money 

to help a company that was having problems with national security 

issues. Perle is also on the board of Onset Technology, the leading 

provider of message conversion technology and a major supplier to 

Bechtel - one of the leading candidates for rebuilding the Iraqi 

infrastructure.



<p>As the Center for Public Integrity has documented, this kind of thing is

quite prevalent on the Defense Policy Board, where at least nine of the 

30 members have ties to companies that have won more than $76 billion in

defense contracts in 2001 and 2002. As more and more wartime contracts 

are announced, more and more conflicts of interest are coming to light. 

After all, the Bush administration is riddled with ties to the weapons, 

engineering, construction, and oil companies that have the most to 

profit from a war in Iraq. Perle's story is certainly not unusual.



<p>However, of all the administration members with potential conflicts of 

interest, none seems more troubling than Vice President Dick Cheney. 

Cheney is former CEO of Halliburton, an oil-services company that also 

provides construction and military support services - a triple-header of

wartime spoils.



<p>A few weeks ago, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers awarded a no-bid 

contract to extinguish oil well fires in Iraq to Kellogg Brown and Root 

(KBR), a subsidiary of Halliburton. The contract was granted under a 

January Bush administration waiver that, according to the Washington 

Post, allowed "government agencies to handpick companies for Iraqi 

reconstruction projects."



<p>The contract, which was not announced until more than two weeks after it

was awarded, was open-ended, with no time limits and no dollar limits. 

It was also a "cost-plus" contract, meaning that the company is 

guaranteed to recover costs and then make a guaranteed profit on top of 

that. Its value is estimated at tens of millions of dollars.



<p>This is not the first buck that Cheney's former company has made off 

military conflict and likely won't be the last. KBR currently has 

thousands of military support personnel on the ground in Kuwait and 

Turkey as part of a multi-year contract worth close to a billion 

dollars. The engineering subsidiary was also one of a select few firms 

invited to bid on an initial $900 million USAID contract for rebuilding 

post-war Iraq. Though it didn't get that job, Halliburton says it is 

still in the running for subcontracts and there will likely be plenty 

more opportunities. After all, the American Academy of Sciences 

estimates the rebuilding Iraq will cost between $30 and $105 billion 

dollars. At a recent investor conference call, Halliburton reported a 

30% increase in year-over-year revenues, to $1.6 billion, for KBR.



<p>Cheney, who served as CEO from 1995 to 2000, continues to receive as 

much as $1 million a year in deferred compensation as Halliburton 

executives enjoy a seat at the table during Administration discussions 

over how to handle post-war oil production in Iraq.



<p>The Cheney-Halliburton story is the classic military-industrial 

revolving door tale. As Secretary of Defense under Bush I, Cheney paid 

Brown and Root services (now Kellogg Brown and Root) $3.9 million to 

report on how private companies could help the U.S. Army as Cheney cut 

hundreds of thousands of Army jobs. Then Brown and Root won a five-year 

contract to provide logistics for the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers all 

over the globe. In 1995, Cheney became CEO and Halliburton jumped from 

73rd to 18th on the Pentagon's list of top contractors, benefiting from 

at least $3.8 billion in federal contracts and taxpayer-insured loans, 

according to the Center for Public Integrity.



<p>But the Halliburton story is more than just a simple revolving door 

tale. Even without the Cheney conflicts of interest, serious doubts 

remain about whether a company with a record like Halliburton's should 

even be eligible to receive government contracts in the first place. 

This, after all, is a company that has been accused of cost overruns, 

tax avoidance, and cooking the books and has a history of doing business

in countries like Iraq, Iran and Libya.



<p>Cost overruns: In September 2000, the General Accounting Office (GAO) 

found that the U.S. Army had not taken appropriate steps to limit the 

$2.2 billion costs Kellogg Brown and Root charged for logistical and 

engineering support in the Balkans. According to the report, Army 

officials "frequently have simply accepted the level of services the 

contractor provided without questioning whether they could be provided 

more efficiently or less frequently at lower cost."



<p>Questionable Accounting: The SEC recently formalized an investigation 

into whether Halliburton artificially inflated revenue by $234 million 

over four years. Halliburton switched to a more aggressive accounting 

method in 1998 under Cheney.



<p>Access to Evil -- business dealings in Iraq, Iran, and Libya: News 

reports suggest that Pentagon is currently using the Iran-Libya 

Sanctions Act (ILSA) to draw up a blacklist of non-US companies that 

have done business in Iran. Yet, Halliburton has conducted Business in 

Iran through subsidiaries. When Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, he 

inquired about an ILSA waiver to pursue oil field developments in Iran. 

In 1997, Halliburton subsidiary Halliburton Energy Services paid $15,000

to settle Department of Commerce allegations that the company had broken

anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act for an 

Iran-related transaction. Halliburton recently agreed to evaluate its 

operations in Iran, after the Securities and Exchange Commission 

rebuffed the company's request to dismiss a New York City police and 

fire pension funds shareholder proposal for the company to examine its 

role in Iran.



<p>Also forgotten is that story about how Cheney's Halliburton did business

with Saddam. According to the Washington Post, "Halliburton held stakes 

in two firms that signed contracts to sell more than $73 million in oil 

production equipment and spare parts to Iraq while Cheney was chairman 

and chief executive officer."



<p>Halliburton has also done business in Azerbaijan, Burma, Indonesia, 

Libya and Nigeria. As Dick Cheney once said, "The good Lord didn't see 

fit to put oil and gas only where there are democratic regimes friendly 

to the United States."



<p>Tax Havens: Under Cheney's tenure, the number of Halliburton 

subsidiaries in offshore tax havens increased from 9 to 44. Meanwhile, 

Halliburton went from paying $302 million in company taxes in 1998 to 

getting an $85 million tax refund in 1999.



<p>All told, the IRS loses about $70 billion a year in offshore tax 

sheltering by corporations and wealthy individuals - almost enough to 

cover the $75 billion Bush has asked for to cover the first six months 

of war.



<p align="center">***</p>



<p>The Halliburton story is part of a larger dynamic that should not be 

forgotten in a debate over contractor responsibility. While the 

Halliburton contracts reek of blatant cronyism, almost all the major 

firms that provide this kind of work are tied to the administration.



<p>Somebody has to do the job. However, the level of secrecy surrounding 

the contracts that have been given out so far is troubling, and 

symptomatic of a bigger problem - the very legitimacy of a 

reconstruction process controlled by the U.S. military and their 

corporate contractors. Although the United States has the obligation to 

pay for the costs of reconstructing Iraq, only the United Nations is the

proper body to provide governance and help rebuild a new government, 

civil society and physical infrastructure if the current regime is 

overthrown, not the White House, the Pentagon and their corporate cronies.





<p>Note: In honor of Big Business Day 2003, Citizen Works will present Dick

Cheney the "Daddy Warbucks" Award for eminence in corporate war 

profiteering on Friday, April 4.
