<p>U.S. forces are closing in on Baghdad to bring freedom to the Iraqi 

people. On the home front, federal authorities are expanding their 

surveillance of U.S. citizens.

<P>The White House decries treatment of U.S. soldiers captured in Iraq. Yet 

Afghan fighters held by the United States are deliberately denied protection 

under the Geneva Convention.

<P>"It's a complete double standard," said Beth Givens, director of the 

Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a San Diego nonprofit organization. "How can we 

preach democracy in Iraq while the government is doing all these other things 

at home?"

<P>This is what civil liberties advocates are asking as the war in Iraq 

intersects with America's war on terror.

<P>"The policies are deeply contradictory," said Pamela Karlan, a professor at 

Stanford Law School who specializes in constitutional law.

<P>No one disputes that law enforcement authorities need to be fully equipped 

to defend the flock from predators. The question critics are asking is how 

many freedoms and legal protections should be sacrificed in the name of 

national security.

<P>"We're living in a whole new world," acknowledged Randall Scarlett, a San 

Francisco attorney who focuses on civil rights cases. "But the degradation of 

citizens' rights cannot in any way be considered a healthy and decent thing to 

do to our democracy."

<P>The latest apparent drop in that bucket is news that the U.S. Justice 

Department has significantly increased use of emergency powers enabling it to 

tap phones and seize personal records without a court's prior approval.

<P>Attorney General John Ashcroft has personally signed more than 170 

"emergency foreign intelligence warrants" allowing wiretaps and searches of 

people deemed threats to national security.

<P>His use of this little-known measure is in fact three times greater than 

that of all other U.S. attorneys general combined over the past 23 years.

<P>"In the post-9/11 world, it shouldn't be a surprise that more emergency 

warrants are being issued," said Mark Corallo, a Justice Department spokesman 

in Washington. "The reason you're doing it is because you're going after spies 

and terrorists."

<P>That would be suspected spies and terrorists?

<P>"Right."

<P>Corallo also stressed that all the anti-terrorism moves have been upheld in 

court, including in the U.S. Supreme Court, which on Monday rejected -- albeit 

on procedural grounds -- a challenge to the government's broader surveillance 

powers.

<P>"This is all within the law," he said. "We're on solid legal ground and 

solid constitutional ground."

<P>But Stanford's Karlan countered that the same was said when courts upheld 

the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and loyalty oaths 

during the McCarthy era.

<P>"The Justice Department may be succeeding in the short run," she said. "It 

will be a different question when we look back 10 years from now and ask 

whether the courts got it right."

<P>Civil liberties advocates have been crying foul ever since passage of the 

Patriot Act in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and 

Pentagon. It expanded the government's ability to conduct surveillance and 

searches.

<P>Meanwhile, they can't help but take note of President Bush's insistence 

that captured U.S. soldiers in Iraq be treated in accordance with the Geneva 

Convention, which requires that prisoners of war "must at all times be 

protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation."

<P>However, the more than 600 prisoners captured by U.S. forces in 

Afghanistan and held at a military facility in Cuba have been denied POW 

status and are instead termed "unlawful combatants." They do not, in turn, 

fall under the safeguards of the Geneva Convention.

<P>"It's a stark example of doublespeak," said Ann Beeson, an attorney for the 

American Civil Liberties Union in New York.

<P>"Protecting civil liberties in this country should serve as an example to 

the rest of the world," she said. "The promise of democracy in Iraq rings 

hollow if we're gutting our own core liberties at home."

<P>What about national security?

<P>"No one's saying you shouldn't vigorously go after terrorists," Beeson 

replied. "But in a democracy, you comply with the Bill of Rights before you do 

it."</p>
