<p>The war in Iraq, like all wars, has left us women behind. </P>
<P>	With the single - and disappointing - exception of Condoleezza Rice, the leaders of this war are men. Bush, Rumsfeld, Brenner, Franks, Wolfowitz, Powell: Men, men, men, every last one of them. </P>
<P>	That's why many women are fuming. </P>
<P>	Men declared this war. Men planned, or failed to plan, this war. Men misled the public to wage this war. </P>
<P>	These men squandered the good will toward America that existed after the Sept. 11 attacks. Now they insist they need at least $87 billion more to protect our soldiers and rebuild Iraq - without shame or apology for misleading the American public and the world. </P>
<P>	Women understand the power of an apology. If George Bush were truly committed to peace, he would apologize for deceiving us about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and then ask the United Nations to forgive his arrogance in ignoring their concerns, charging ahead like a cowboy and goading the terrorists to "bring it on." Then true healing could begin. </P>
<P>	To the warmongers who think that is a hopelessly naive and misguided strategy, I simply ask: And your way has worked how? </P>
<P>	To all you men who insist there are plenty of men, too, who want peace, I say: You're right. We thank you, and our children thank you. </P>
<P>	Recent polls say the majority of women in this country oppose this war. Last weekend, I spoke to more than 500 women at a gathering on Cleveland's West Side. The empathy in their nodding faces was palpable as I described the mother who took her young daughter to a peace rally last March, not because she thought she could stop the war but because she wanted her daughter to know she tried. </P>
<P>	Most women oppose war, but, of course, we would. Women and children are the majority of victims in any armed conflict, making up 80 percent of the refugees and citizens displaced by war. Women are disproportionately affected by the loss of personal security, food, shelter and medical care. And it is mostly women who tend to the children of war when they are orphaned, afraid and malnourished, sick and in pain. </P>
<P>	And yet, women's voices are virtually ignored in wartime. We're the softer sex, the relationship experts. We know nothing about waging war, the theory goes. We need to leave this to the menfolk. </P>
<P>	Well, we did, didn't we? And look at the mess we're in. </P>
<P>	This is no time for women to decide that what we say doesn't matter. It's up to us to make sure it does. And remember, there is strength in our numbers. </P>
<P>	Joan Blades, co-founder of the progressive Web site MoveOn.org, says nearly a million American women have logged on to voice their objections to this war. </P>
<P>	"That's one of the strongest ways for women to be heard," she said, "by using the Internet to get involved." Blades sent me this recent e-mail from a mother grateful for the Web site: </P>
<P>	"Daily, I am shocked and distraught by what I see happening in our country," she wrote. "I feel like I should be doing something to stop it." </P>
<P>	But work and family concerns have to come first, she said. "I drop into bed at the end of the day beyond exhausted, and beyond frustrated that there has not been enough time to handle the basics well, much less to change the world. Sometimes . . . I wonder if that isn't part of the plan - to keep people in such a state of stress and exhaustion that they have no energy to fight." </P>
<P>	This is the perfect time to remind our elected officials that history knows an angry woman is a voting woman. Remind them - by phone, e-mail or letter - that you plan to hold them accountable in direct proportion to their willingness to make the president accountable. </P>
<P>	We don't dare doubt the power of our own voice. We will continue to be ignored only with our permission. And keep in mind the wise words of Mahatma Gandhi, who knew a thing or two about persistence in the face of resistance: </P>
<P>	<i>First they ignore you. </i><br>
<i>Then they laugh at you. </i><br>
<i>Then they fight you. </i><br>
<i>Then you win. </i></P>
