<p>Despite the resounding victory against the Iraqi regime, we remain a nation divided. The aftermath of the controversial 2000 election perhaps is the best indicator that we were already there even before Sept. 11. The attacks did bring the nation together, but the president's subsequent reactive war policies created a rupture to that unprecedented unity.

<p>Prior to the beginning of the Iraqi campaign, the majority of the nation did not support the war. The media conglomerates, largely acting as a propaganda machine for the government, created the false impression that most of the citizenry supported unilateral war. Couple that with the president's controversial economic policies that unabashedly favor big business and the super rich, and more division is created.

<p>Now the country is divided about whether the United States -- as the most prosperous and powerful nation on Earth -- has the right to impose its will upon the world just because it proclaims itself as the most moral, free and fair nation. Many who believe this also believe it has been divinely preordained (manifest destiny). As such, it is the United States alone that has earned the right to lead the world, not the world's community of nations.

<p>For some, it is a continuation of the division between white/non-white, Republican/Democrat, conservative/liberal, rich/poor, Christian/non-Christian, patriot/traitor and native/alien. President Bush seems to view this division as an epic struggle between good and evil. However it is characterized, there is little doubt that we are in the midst of an unprecedented uncivil war, pitting neighbor against neighbor.

<p>The war itself can be defined as a struggle for the conscience of the nation. The fact that the United States is the world's most dominant power means that this battle actually takes on a global significance. Whichever side wins not only defines the values of the nation, but also inordinately influences the world.

<p>Unquestionably, President Bush -- along with his administration, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz and John Ashcroft -- clearly speaks for one side of the divide. The other side appears to be leaderless -- or part of a leaderless rebellion.

<p>What the president is clear about is that war is part of the nation's future. The colossal struggle he has embarked upon evokes a vision of constant worldwide war. Most telling about his psyche is that after Sept. 11, he stated that he had now found his purpose as president. As such, he is not the president of 2000, but rather one who believes he's been divinely chosen to lead this nation in a biblical struggle against the forces of evil. The end result of this struggle is U.S. world domination and military superiority -- bad if led by a dictator, but good if led by a benevolent leader.

<p>The way the president has shaped this battle, you're either with him or against him. (Most of the world's spiritual and moral leaders were against him in the second Iraqi war.) He has parlayed his dictum not just to the war on terrorism, but to everything from his tax cuts to deregulating business to the environment.

<p>One may differ with the president's vision, but he can't be accused of being unclear or inconsistent. As a result, his adherents -- perhaps half the nation -- believe the war is minimally good if not necessary, and that sacrificing our rights and freedoms is a fair trade-off.

<p>This is separate from whether his administration was truthful in making a case for war against Iraq and whether patriotism and fear have been exploited to achieve his aims.

<p>Those on the opposite side of the divide reject war as a solution to modern problems, believing that we are all part of one interconnected humanity. Those who hold this view don't see the United States as superior to other peoples and nations. Instead they see all peoples, nations and cultures as equal. They also hold the view that the motor of history must be peace, justice and equality, not simply security.

<p>Those who carry this message deliver it just as clearly. But they are hampered by two things. First, virtually no one from the mainstream of the Democratic Party embraces this message, and second, those with this view have been, in effect, censored.

<p>Because those who promote peace normally constitute the conscience of any nation, one can conclude that the president and his administration -- who promote permanent and pre-emptive war -- now represent the anti-conscience of the nation. The only question is whether the conscience of the nation needs an embodiment. Perhaps not, but it is necessary to be able to contend for the presidency.
