<p>'Big Oil" is controlled by foreign companies. The United States and its oil companies lost control of the price and production of world oil when our production peaked in the early 1970s and U.S. overseas production interests were nationalized. War and terrorism in the Middle East will add to the price of gasoline. 

<p>The U.S. oil industry virtually invented the modern oil business at the beginning of the 20th century. Oil, natural gas and other fuels, along with our abundant agricultural land, water, forests, mineral resources and our governmental system, enabled us to become the world's industrial power at the lowest possible costs. 

<p>That time of independence has passed. We are now importing almost 60 percent of the crude oil we need for transportation fuel, which is five times the average consumption of the rest of the world. This cannot be maintained. 

<p>About 85 percent of the world's oil and more than 70 percent of the known reserves of natural gas are in the world's Eastern Hemisphere. Prices are controlled by production limitations and the economic requirements of the nations where the reserves are found. 

<p>Furthermore, these nations are being connected by pipelines between producing and marketing centers in Europe, Asia and Africa. The geographic location of major deposits of oil and natural gas runs northward from the Middle East to northwestern Siberia. This area is surrounded by more than 5 billion people with a growing population that has serious economic deficiencies and religious and political differences. 

<p>Growth of demand and the decline in crude-oil production of the largest and older Middle Eastern producing fields will create additional pressure on world energy supplies in the next 20 years. This will further strain the political systems in the developing world. 

<p>We are beginning to see the consequences of the war in Iraq on the competing interests in the Middle East. This situation will increase our own economic insecurity and must be truthfully addressed by our political representatives. They have the responsibility to convince the people of this country that they have no birthright to cheap energy. 

<p>There have been eight or nine wars in the Middle East since the end of World War II. Our country has been directly or indirectly involved in all of them and the amount of money that this has cost us probably already exceeds the Marshall Plan aid that was spent on rebuilding Europe and Japan after World War II. There is every prospect that this will continue unless our politicians consider the consequences of their inaction. The credibility of our government is being eroded by our efforts to maintain a wasteful and immoral use of our and other countries' natural resources.
