<p>This year the day of reckoning for national income taxes fell during Holy Week,
as Christians celebrated the Passion of Jesus, who taught that we should love
one another -- even our enemies --  be merciful, and help the poor and the least
among us.
 
<p>This is also a year when a self-proclaimed Christian heads the wealthiest and
most powerful nation on earth.  So how is this Christian is spending your income
tax dollars? 

<p>Your income taxes go into an account called &quot;Federal Funds&quot; from which &quot;outlays&quot;
are made.  These are expenditures which are either &quot;mandatory&quot; because of
previous legislation or &quot;discretionary&quot; -- selected each year.  This year there
will be about $780 billion in discretionary spending from Federal Funds of
$1,731. 

<p>There is a bigger pie,  the &quot;Unified Budget&quot;, of about $2.27 trillion.  It
includes Federal Funds plus funds like Social Security, Medicare and highway
funds, which are collected and spent separately from tax funds .  The Unified
Budget is often used to scare us about deficits or reassure us how little we
spend on controversial items, so today we'll stick with just Federal Funds.

<p>Nearly half of the outlays from Federal Funds (your tax dollars) goes for
military spending.  It is hard to be precise, because arbitrary decisions have
to be made about what goes in which category.  Should we count veteran's medical
services as health care or military expenses?   Is NASA defense or commerce?  Is
Homeland Security justice or defense?  Should housing be economic development or
family support?  Do clean water and clean air belong under environment or
health?  

<p>Another 35% of your tax dollar goes to &quot;human resources&quot; like education, health,
food,  housing, social programs.  About 15% goes to running the government --
including the interest on the national debt. 

<p>This sounds too simple, and it is.  First, even that huge percentage for
military spending doesn't include spending for the war on Iraq or the war on
terrorism.  Second, income tax revenues are down, mostly because of huge tax
cuts to the wealthy.  But regardless of cause, the effect has been severe
reductions in the amount of money (your tax dollars) returned to the states to
fund domestic programs.  

<p>Now let's come back to the ground in NE Ohio.  Last year the good people of 
Portage County pitched in to build a new Miller Community House to serve their
homeless neighbors.  Generous contributions were made by local businesses and
government, by churches, clubs and private citizens.  Volunteers from Habitat
for Humanity and other groups did much of the work.  Altogether the value of the
new building is about $500,000, because of community contributions, it's
completely paid for.

<p>But it costs $145,000 a year to operate.  In the past, almost a third of that
($45,800) has come  from the Ohio Housing Trust Fund.  This year, because of the
state budget crisis, funds for all housing and homeless programs have been
dropped from the general budget.  

<p>The state administration has proposed new dedicated funding for the Housing
Trust Fund by doubling the fee (average about $15) charged for recording
documents like real-estate transfers.   That doesn't seem a terribly burdensome
increase, especially as a one-time fee when a house worth tens of thousands of
dollars changes owners.  No doubt a large majority of Ohioans would vote for
such an increase.

<p>But Ohioans don't get to vote on it -- only legislators, who are under pressure
to vote against it (H.B. 95) from mortgage and title companies and county
recorders.  

<p>And there is no Plan B.  If H.B. 95 fails, Miller Community House will lose a
third of its operating funding and will have to close or severely reduce its
services.  

<p>Of course the good people of Portage County could scramble up another $45,000
this year.  But should we have to?   Let's make some connections between your
federal income tax dollar and Miller Community House: 

<p>--Every tax dollar spent on deadly weapons and war is a dollar you will have to
replace in order to have the humane programs you want as a good neighbor in your
community.  For about the cost of three cluster bombs (the ones that were so
effective in killing and wounding Iraqi children) we could assure that Miller
Community House stays open this year.  

<p>-Every dollar a millionaire doesn't pay in taxes shrinks the pie that feeds us
all.  With the gargantuan appetite of the military, there isn't much pie left
for the many challenges we face as a nation -- hungry and homeless people,
education, health care, jobs, the environment. 

<p>So what can you do?  

<p>As a resident of Portage County you can help your local officials apportion what
funds there are wisely.  As an Ohio citizen you can make sure your legislators
pass H.B. 95  to insure funding for shelters like Miller Community House. 

<p>As a U.S. citizen you can demand that your Congress stop cutting taxes for the
wealthy and start addressing human and domestic problems.  You can support
Senator Voinovich in his principled stand against massive tax cuts for the rich.
 

<p>This Easter you might even compare the Passion of Jesus to the &quot;compassion&quot; of
Bush.  Or at least question the &quot;Christian&quot; priorities and policies of an
administration that rewards the rich, starts a war, and leaves behind the
starving, the sick, the poor, the uneducated, and the dispossessed of the world,
our nation, our state and our community.
