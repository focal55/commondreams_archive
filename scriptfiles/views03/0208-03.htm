<p><I>From ghoulies and ghosties and long leggety beasties<br>
And things that go bump in the night,<br>
Good Lord, deliver us!<br>
</I>&#151; Scottish prayer
<P>It was one of those memorable speeches &#151; the sort that causes listeners to swoon with evangelical fervor. He talked all about the need for one human to love another. 
<P>Addressing a crowd of 3,000 at the Adam's Mark Hotel in Denver, John Ashcroft, attorney general of the United States, talked not about law but about love. He said, among other things, that "When a need is expressed, you don't have to be the proverbial rocket scientist, a theoretical mathematician. You don't have to be a Ph.D. You just have to be a person whose spirit responds to the need and says, 'I will.'" 

<P>Commenting on the need for individuals to love one another he said: "While government programs provide for entitlements, when one citizen reaches for another, or one organization, or a group of citizens, does so based on an overwhelming conviction within them that we are one, it says something more than 'You are entitled.' It says 'I love you' and 'I love you' is something that needs to be said more frequently in our culture." 

<P>It's nice that Mr. Ashcroft wants people to say that they love each other. It's really quite easy. It is, after all, only three words. That does not necessarily imply compassion, yet another quality some (though not Mr. Ashcroft) associate with love. He has once again shown the world that you can love people while working to make sure ones you love less are killed. 

<P>John Ashcroft is preaching love from the saddle of the death penalty horse that he is riding for all it's worth. He's riding that horse when lots of other horsemen have dismounted because they have concluded that in its present incarnation too many mistakes have been made. Illinois is the best example. 

<P>Before leaving office, Illinois Gov. George Ryan released a few men on death row whose innocence had been established. He commuted the sentences of all the others to life in prison. He did it because he had been convinced that there was too great a chance that among the men on death row there might be others, in addition to those he released, who might be innocent. His was not the only voice questioning imposition of the death penalty. 

<P>On Jan. 31 it was reported that Maryland's attorney general had called for the abolition of the death penalty. Addressing a news conference, Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said: "Capital punishment comes only at the intolerable risk of killing an innocent person. This is unworthy of us." 

<P>It may be an intolerable risk for Mr. Curran, but for Mr. Ashcroft it is nothing less than an opportunity. Its availability and hoped-for use is what caused him to inject the federal government into the John Muhammad and Lee Malvo cases. They are the man and boy accused of being the snipers who terrorized the Washington, D.C., area for most of October. 
<P>Mr. Ashcroft personally intervened and arranged for the federal government to file extortion charges against the two men, thus depriving Maryland, where the shootings started and ended, of the right to try them. He wanted the men tried in Virginia, a state where there is the greatest likelihood of the death penalty being imposed. Making sure that the death penalty was available so Messrs. Malvo and Muhammad can be executed has not been Mr. Ashcroft's only excursion into the death chamber. His most recent foray occurred in the case of Jairo Zapata. 
<P>Mr. Zapata shares a quality with many of the folks in prison. He is an unsavory sort &#151; the sort it would be hard for a mother to love, even if she had heard Mr. Ashcroft's speech in Denver. Mr. Zapata was allegedly involved in a deadly Colombian drug ring and was implicated in two murders. The United States attorney's office in New York negotiated a plea deal with Mr. Zapata under which Mr. Zapata would testify against former colleagues in exchange for a promise that the death penalty would not be invoked. His lawyers obtained a written and signed agreement that confirmed the deal. Upon learning of the deal, Mr. Ashcroft smelled blood. In Mr. Zapata he saw yet another opportunity to invoke the death penalty. On Jan. 31, the same day the Maryland attorney general announced his opposition to the death penalty, Mr. Ashcroft ordered the United States attorneys to seek the death penalty for Mr. Zapata. 
<P>This is the latest in a series of cases in which Mr. Ashcroft has insisted on execution instead of a life sentence as a punishment. It is said to be, however, the first case under Mr. Ashcroft's rule in which the life sentence was promised in exchange for cooperating with the prosecution. 
<P>The result of the new policy means, according to some commentators, that it will become more difficult to obtain convictions. Jim Walden, a former senior federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, said "It will likely result in fewer murders being solved because fewer defendants will choose to cooperate." 
<P>Justice Department spokespersons, on the other hand, said oxymoronically that the department's involvement at the attorney-general level would "guarantee the fair implementation of the death penalty." As Mr. Ashcroft said in Denver, "When a need is expressed, you don't have to be the proverbial rocket scientist, a theoretical mathematician. You just have to be a person whose spirit responds to the need and says, 'I will.'" His need in this case is to kill another human being. He is faithful to his charge. He has said "I will."
