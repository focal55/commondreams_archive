<p>You can't argue as many rape cases before a jury as I did during my time as 
a New York City prosecutor and not understand that our society harbors some deep-seated 
rape myths — cultural misconceptions about sexual violence that interfere with 
our adequately addressing the prevalence of sexual assault. In recent years, most 
of these rape myths had gone underground, seemingly because it would have been 
unpopular to express them. But now, distressingly, the Kobe Bryant case has granted 
them all permission to resurface. <p>Something about this case seems to have given 
a more hateful voice to prejudice. The death threats against the prosecutor (which 
have required additional security measures) and the complainant (for which two 
individuals already face charges) are only the most extreme signs of a public 
enraged that anyone would accuse a basketball superstar "role model" of a sex 
crime. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, we insist on believing that only 
"certain kinds" of readily identifiable men commit rape. That is perhaps the most 
dangerous of our myths. <p>There are a few standard defenses to a rape charge: 
The rape never happened; it happened, but someone else committed the crime; or 
it wasn't rape, but consensual sex. Sometimes, such explicit defenses are poorly 
supported by fact or logic. They are presented to jurors only to give them an 
excuse to acquit. Far more powerful is the unstated defense that depends upon 
jurors' buying into rape myths — myths such as the one that insists, for example, 
that "real" victims resist to within an inch of their lives. Nothing in the legal 
definition of sexual assault in any jurisdiction corroborates such beliefs, but 
they persist with a force that sometimes exceeds the force of the law itself. 
<p>It's impossible, of course, to know the truth about the Kobe Bryant case at 
this stage. But almost from the start, Bryant's defenders jumped on the rape-myth 
bandwagon. One of the first "facts" presented in support of his innocence was 
that he is married — and what's more, his wife is beautiful. Originally, his wife's 
attractiveness was offered as proof that Bryant would not be interested in sex 
with another woman. This morphed into a rape myth once Bryant admitted to what 
he referred to as "adultery." The rape myth is that men with ample opportunity 
for sex do not "need" to rape. But there is no evidence that men rape because 
they have been deprived of consensual — including paid-for — sex. Rape is not 
merely forcible sexual intercourse. It is a complex drive, with varying motivations. 
To use the "only a hungry man will steal food" paradigm is both ignorant and pernicious. 
<p>But the biggest rape myth of all is that jurors in sexual-assault cases are 
blank slates. In fact, the danger in every sexual-assault prosecution is that 
the result has been determined before the jury is seated. That's the real stake 
in the pretrial publicity surrounding the Bryant prosecution. <p>Colorado law 
permits prosecutors to satisfy their minimal legal burden at a preliminary hearing 
by offering hearsay evidence. No conscientious prosecutor voluntarily exposes 
his or her witnesses to unnecessary pretrial cross-examination. Yet when Eagle 
County Judge Frederick Gannett, in his opinion binding the matter over for trial, 
made some gratuitous comments complaining about the inherent weakness of such 
hearsay evidence, the media dutifully reported that the case against Bryant itself 
was weak. The truth is, we simply don't know the strength of the case, and neither 
could a judge who heard primarily hearsay. The judge conceded as much in his opinion: 
"The court understands that the people have no obligation to present all, or even 
the best of, its evidence at a preliminary hearing, however the court can rule 
only on what was presented and admitted into evidence." <p>Yet public opinion 
about the complainant shifted dramatically as soon as the defense claimed that 
she had had consensual sex in the days preceding her encounter with Bryant. The 
defense's transparently specious justification for raising this "fact" at a preliminary 
hearing was the possibility that the gynecological signs of forcible intercourse 
may have been caused by someone other than Bryant. The unstated argument raised 

by this claim (and the one directly targeted at the media) is that this victim 
is "unworthy." Because still another rape myth is that "a slut cannot be raped." 
<p>There is no criminological data to support a correlation between the prior 
sexual activity of a victim and the likelihood of sexual assault. Prostitutes 
are no more likely to be raped than virgins. Yet even though Bryant has conceded 
an act of intercourse, there is inordinate interest in what biological sera may 
have been found in his accuser's underwear. In truth, her sexual activity or inactivity 
outside this incident is no more relevant to the issue of consent than his. <p>For 
defense purposes, the most effective rape myths are those that give the jury permission 
to be indifferent toward (or even resentful of) the complaining witness. FBI crime 
statistics suggest that false complaints are no more frequent in sexual assault 
than in any other crime, and this was borne out by my experience when I ran a 
special victims bureau. But rape myths warn jurors that there is a lurking population 
of disturbed or calculating women eager to "cry rape." <p>Old issues about the 
conventional roles of women crop up in rape trials in the form of disapproval 
of a victim, and are expressed as "doubt." In my experience, jurors have trouble 
deciding that it's "really rape" if a woman is out alone, especially at night 
or in a bad neighborhood (even if it's her own neighborhood). Jurors are concerned 
with how a victim was dressed even when "consent" is not the defense. Jurors judge 
a rape victim who consumed alcohol on the night she was raped (whether or not 
the rapist was present when she had a drink), or who seems to generally enjoy 
sex (whether or not she is married), or who is unmarried but sexually active. 
The punishment for such conduct by a woman is a refusal to believe her accusations. 
<p>One of the decisions I most regret in my career as a prosecutor was agreeing 
to a teen-age rape victim's request to testify before she delivered her baby. 
When the jury learned that the defendant was not the father, and that the baby 
was the result of consensual sex after the rape, they decided that the night screams 
in the schoolyard that had prompted the 911 call could have been sounds of "pleasure." 
In fact, although many rape victims subsequently fear sex, many others seek out 
situations in which they can exercise consent as a way of regaining a sense of 
control. <p>Not all rape myths are anti-victim. This country has a shameful history 
of rape myths surrounding black men interacting with white women. We have finally 
begun to recognize that such myths are virulent when they target the accused. 
But when we're given permission to disapprove of a complainant's lifestyle, it 
triggers the exercise of all sorts of other prejudice toward her. The most unashamed 
racism I've ever heard expressed has been directed toward sex crimes victims. 
In Queens County, I learned that if I heard about an inexplicable acquittal in 
a sex crimes case, the first thing to ask was whether the victim was a Latina. 
As one well-educated woman of a different color put it when I raised this issue 
in a community forum on rape awareness: "Well, but ... we all know they're promiscuous." 
<p>Many jurors also tend to doubt rape victims who are too emotional, or not emotional 
enough; angry, or sullen, or inarticulate; too young, or too old; too ugly, or 
too pretty; or the wrong gender, or any class other than middle class. <p>Researchers 
have developed rape-myth acceptance scales that good sex crimes prosecutors borrow 
for jury selection purposes. All these scales consider it critical to measure 
the intensity of the subjects' beliefs. Measured against these scales, the degree 
of reaction against the prosecution of Kobe Bryant is alarming. There is so much 
anger that anyone would dare accuse him of rape that an Internet Web site, openly 
proclaiming the complainant's name, offers to provide her home address to any 
interested parties. Jeff Reichman, one of the two men who created the site, told 
the Rocky Mountain News he did it because "There are not really any superstars 
to look up to anymore." Bryant's status as a role model, has much of the public 
rallying to a cause we know almost nothing about. <p>We already know, from the 
painful betrayals of our children, that the clean-cut guy who coaches the Little 
League basketball team may turn out to be a child molester. One rapist I prosecuted 
pleaded guilty to more than 80 counts of sexual assault. Before his arrest, he 
had been elected the local "Man of the Year." Yet people believe, passionately, 
that it is indisputable proof of Bryant's innocence that he plays basketball so 
well on the court and that he seems so "nice" off it. <p>The only publicly known 
facts about what occurred on June 30 in the Lodge & Spa at Cordillera in Eagle 
County, Colo., come from statements made by the defendant. We do not know what 
he originally told authorities, because that preliminary hearing testimony was 
sealed as being too prejudicial to him. Bryant gave two subsequent statements 
to the media. The first was on July 12, to Los Angeles Times sportswriter Bill 
Plaschke: "When everything comes clean, it will all be fine, you'll see. ... But 
you guys know me, I shouldn't have to say anything. You know I would never do 
something like that." Six days later, after the lab results came back, he gave 
a press conference and acknowledged sexual intercourse, but denied force. <p>It 
is fundamental to our criminal justice system that at this point Bryant be presumed 
innocent. It is apparently not fundamental, though, that a person who reports 
sexual victimization to the authorities be entitled to that same presumption.
