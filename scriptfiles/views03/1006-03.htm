<p>Last month the children at Olympic View Elementary School got a lesson about leadership. Mary K. McNeill, a respected and beloved music teacher, did not return on the first day of school. She was asked to choose between the principles that guided her commitment to teaching and the policy that Seattle Public Schools has about controversial issues. She stuck with her commitment to her students.

 
 
<p>Some parents had complained about a verse in a song that the teacher and her children wrote together. The objectionable verse reads: "We don't want war anymore -- we are the children of the world." Somehow this line was construed to mean these children were being influenced to protest the war in Iraq. According to school district policy, this controversial notion needed to be presented in a more balanced way.

<p>The teacher did not agree that this verse, suggested by a 7-year-old in one of her classes, implied disagreement with our government's promotion of war in Iraq. The sentiment opposed war, period. The child who first voiced these words easily could have been the child in a military family, even though he was not. But wouldn't even such a child be against any war that put his loved one in harm's way? Would we consider such a child unpatriotic?

<p>The words of the song, though, are not really the main issue. The more important issue has to do with how these controversial words were mishandled. And for me, the question I would ask is "Who is the leader in this situation?"

<p>A leader is a person who has the capacity to balance her own critical self-awareness against the need for objectivity. A leader is a person who understands her role in serving the common good. A leader shares power and has the ability to empower others. By her example, a leader inspires other people to follow.

<p>In this instance, the teacher was aware that there would be multiple feelings about peace and war. She did not impose her adult perspective on the students. She wanted to hear and validate their perspectives. She asked the children to suggest verses for the song. By doing so, she empowered them. What we hear in their voices is the hope, however innocent, for a world without war. Adults may disagree as to whether such a hope is realistic but they cannot deny the child a right to express his or her dream.

<p>Now their teacher is no longer with them. Her absence implies that sharing one's opinion is risky, especially when someone has power over you. Such power can silence a child forever. Do we want our schools to be in the business of diminishing children's worth and dignity by discouraging their free expression? Is the purpose of education to brand adult minds upon the young or rouse their own minds to moral awakening?

<p>When adults first objected to these childish words, they should have been given an opportunity to engage in a conversation with those people content with them. Only a leader would have had the insight to handle the situation in this way. A very constructive and fruitful encounter might have taken place. The children then would have had the experience of adults working out their differences.

<p>The one who emerges as a leader here is the music teacher. She saw her role as protecting the integrity of the children over her own job security. She would not capitulate to fear and dysfunction. Because she did not want to give the children a mixed message by singing their song one way now and another way tomorrow, she led by not misleading them. It takes courage to live your life in this way.

<p>We live in fearful times. The specter of terrorism has frightened all of us. We have become polarized in our reactions to this fear. But mishandling our conflicts is not helpful. We have a choice to allow these fears to erode our collaborative efforts in tackling the urgent issues of our day or to challenge these fears by finding a way that will honor whatever remnant of integrity persists in people.

<p>This is a lesson we can all learn. It is heartbreaking that to think that this is the last lesson this teacher will share with those children.
