<p>Sitting on her bed, talking about life plans, relationships, and politics, 
it almost feels like when we were in college. Except that the bed is cold 
concrete and we don't have much choice about the tempo of our visit ­ we 
must cram our conversations into the official visiting hours during my short 
time in Peru. As on my other trips to the prison, I am so glad to be there, 
catching up on the years between visits. But there is also a lingering 
weight that cannot be ignored.
<p>Lori has been in prison for eight years of a twenty-year sentence. She is 
accused of aiding the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), a small 
rebel group in Peru. The Organization of American States' Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights has declared that Peru has violated her rights on 
a number of fronts. For example, she has been charged under laws that are 
out of compliance with international human rights standards according to 
<p>Amnesty International and the OAS.
Despite the clear international and legal arguments on her side, Lori is uncertain as to what the future holds. 
She thinks that the political situation within Peru has more of a bearing on her future than the 
outcome of her legal case, which will be heard by the OAS Inter-American 
Court on Human Rights next year.
<p>Although the period of violence that has claimed tens of thousands of 
Peruvian lives has come to an end, there has been no resolution of the 
underlying conflicts. The conditions that drove thousands of citizens to 
take up arms have not improved. The majority of the population lives on less 
than $2 a day. The government officials still use the country's money to 
benefit themselves and sell off common resources to outside investors.
<p>During the war, and especially during the regime of President Fujimori 
(1990-2000), citizens' right to dissent was violently squashed. Journalists 
who criticized the government were kidnapped and tortured; lawyers who 
defended political prisoners were arrested; and jails filled up with people 
convicted of terrorism under laws so vague that almost anything could be 
defined as a terrorist act. The recent Truth and Reconciliation report 
estimates that 69,000 people were killed between 1980 and 2000: 
approximately 30% by the government, 17% by government-aligned 
paramilitaries, 51% by the Shining Path (a Maoist rebel group), and under 2% 
by the MRTA. 
<p>Some things are improving in Peru. One taxi driver we met observed that the 
current president, Alejandro Toledo, has reduced the political repression. 
Newspapers more freely criticize the government and people can again express 
their views without imminent fear of death or arrest. Even so, in reaction 
to recent strikes, Toledo declared a state of emergency, instituting 
military rule for 30 days. And the economic situation has not improved at 
all; some say it has gotten worse.
<p>President Toledo has agreed to abide by the findings of the OAS Court on 
Lori's case, due out late 2004. But whether he will in fact do so remains to 
be seen. Toledo has so little support in Peru that there is a movement afoot 
within the government to oust him before his term is up. Even if he survives 
this attempt, he is not a strong leader and may be unable or unwilling to 
take clear action on any front. The Committee to Free Lori Berenson is 
gathering the support of organizations worldwide to push for Lori's release 
when the OAS ruling is released. (For more information on this campaign, see 
  <a href="http://www.freelori.org" target="_new">www.freelori.org</a>.)
<p>Meanwhile, Lori continues to live her life as best she can. She recently got 
married to Anibal Apari, whom she met in Yanamayo Prison soon after her 
arrest. He was recently released on parole after serving 12 years of a 
15-year sentence. He plans to visit Lori as often as he can and will be 
returning to law school to finish his studies. So many students were 
arrested over the past fifteen years that the universities have established 
a special process for helping them return to school.
<p>Despite the dreary and confining circumstances Lori is in, she continues to 
be very lively and generous. While I was there she made a cake for other 
prisoners and gave some of the groceries I brought to some of the male 
prisoners. Her ability to make the best of such conditions is always an 
inspiration to me.
<p><i>Kristen Gardner was Lori's college roommate at MIT. She has been working for Lori's 
release and for the rights of all prisoners in Peru. In November she visited 
Lori for the third time since her arrest in 1995.</i></p>
