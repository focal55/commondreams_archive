<p>I wonder how Seymour Melman feels these days.  For over half a 

century, this Columbia University industrial engineering professor (now 

emeritus) has been researching, writing and speaking about the massive 

overspending on the military portion of the federal budget and how this 

waste is de-industrializing America, costing millions of jobs and 

starving the investment in public works -- repairing the crucial 

physical capital of America.

<p>Recently, he prepared a memorandum called "The Pentagon Connection" 

where he recounted the massive redundancy and costliness of various 

weapons systems -- such as the next wave of fighter planes, missiles, 

submarines and aircraft carriers -- and the opportunity cost so adverse 

to the domestic needs of our country.  Remember, the U.S. no longer has 

a major opponent that used to justify huge military budgets.  Both 

Russia and China are converting quickly to the state 

capitalistic-oligarchic model and the Soviet Union is no more.

<p>First, Professor Melman cites the Report Card for America's 

Infrastructure that was issued by the American Society of Civil 

Engineers.  (<a href="http://www.asce.org/reportcard" target="_new">asce.org/reportcard</a>).  One and a third trillion dollars are

estimated for the repair of twelve categories of public works, including

schools, drinking water systems, sewage systems, airports, public 

transit, bridges and roads.

<p>The Engineering society found what any person who observes -- great 

needs coming from great disrepair and decay.  Adding $618 billion for 

repair of U.S. housing and railroads brings the capital improvement 

needs to a $2.0 trillion market, he notes.

<p>Mr. Melman, whose knowledge of U.S. industry is legendary, 

adds:"Every manufacturing industry whose products are required for 

repairing and modernizing America's infrastructure is left out by the 

federal government's military plans."  And expenditures.

<p>The military economy drains the civilian economy and this trend has 

been accelerating into what Melman called a "huge change" in the 

American economy.  He writes: "This deindustrialization has happened so 

quickly that America's capacity to produce anything is seriously 

undermined.  For example, last year the New York City government 

announced its plans to buy a new fleet of subway cars.  Though this 

contract is worth $3-4 billion, not one U.S. firm responded.  Of 100 

products offered in this fall's L.L. Bean catalogue, 92 are imported and

only 8 are made in the U.S.A."

<p>"Closing U.S. factories has not only left millions without work, but

has also diminished the U.S. production capability required for 

repairing our broken infrastructure," Melman says.

    Melman doesn't mention it in his memo, but previous studies have 

demonstrated that a million dollars in civilian investment creates more 

jobs than a million dollars in military weapons systems.

<p>The states and cities are reporting deeper deficits.  This year, the

states will be over $60 billion in the red.  Taxes and tolls are going 

up.  Necessities are being cut -- outlays, Melman points out, for 

schools, libraries, fire and police departments, sanitation department, 

child welfare, health care and services for elderly people.  But there 

are hundreds of billions for Soviet-era type weapons driven by the 

weapons corporations and their campaign cash for key members of Congress

who decide the distortions of your tax dollars.

<p>Recently, Bob Herbert, a columnist for the New York Times, 

interviewed the well-known financier, Felix Rohatyn, who was involved in

the response to the City's fiscal crisis in the 1970s.  The current 

fiscal crisis ofthe states and cities is, to Mr. Rohatyn, very serious.

<p>Mr. Rohatyn told Mr. Herbert that he believes that a $75 

billion-a-year program of federal assistance to state and local 

governments combined with a $75-billion-a-year tax cut for working 

people would provide a substantial boost to the economy, and over time 

would result in the creation of several million jobs.

<p>But, in spite of polls (as well opinions expressed by military 

experts, like retired General Anthony Zinni) showing that a large 

majority of the American people do not believe that President Bush has 

made the case that Iraq threatens the U.S. nor do they want him to 

commit our troops unilaterally, the White House chief is willing to 

spend at least $150 billion and incur casualties pursuing this obsession

while ignoring life-saving needs in our country.
