<p>Is there any way we can stop the America juggernaut from invading the sovereign nation of Iraq in our names?<p> That is a question millions of Americans are asking, with increasing desperation.<p> <!-- END LEAD --> <!-- START REST --> There have been enormous peace marches in various cities, more than 50 city councils, including Chicago, have passed resolutions opposing such a pre-emptive attack; organized religious groups of all major faiths and denominations have come out against a U.S. invasion.<p> This anti-war movement is increasingly assertive. The media have yet to give it coverage commensurate with its numbers, though soon even they will have no choice. But this rising chorus of opposition has failed to offset the Bush administration's pro-war propaganda. That campaign shifted into high gear Wednesday when Secretary of State Colin Powell wowed 'em over at the UN Security Council.<p> The charismatic Powell may have played well in Peoria, but apparently he did little to convince those Security Council members needed to authorize military action through the UN. Powell's performance was short on revelation and long on assertions and audio/visual aids.<p> It was sad to see such a respected figure spend so much of his hard-earned credibility trying to push such a faulty case.<p> Just as the Bush administration is using Powell's charisma to make its definitive case for war, the anti-war opposition is looking for a charismatic argument that could swing the American people away from war in one great swoosh.<p> The general principle against invading a sovereign nation would once have been enough to convince most Americans to oppose this military aggression. Remember, the "deliberate instigation of aggressive wars," was one of the primary charges for which the Nazi regime was found guilty at the Nuremberg trials in 1945-46.<p> Unilateral aggression was universally condemned by an evolving global community of nations, and was generally accepted as a rule of international law.<p> The notion forbidding unilateral use of force was incorporated into the UN charter and it later justified the Gulf War of 1992, after Iraq aggressively invaded Kuwait.<p> But the unilateralists pulling the strings in the Bush administration seem convinced that the time has come for an aggressive war.<p> The fact that we are openly discussing invading another country in a pre-emptive war to force a "regime change," is itself the product of a political landscape that has shifted dramatically to the right. More specifically, it's a testament to the powerful influence of a particular clique of right-wing ideologues.<p> In fact, the anti-war movement may benefit by publicizing just how well this clique has played the American public. Americans may lack a sophisticated understanding of global issues, but we all know when we've been had.<p> In the spring of 1997, a group of prominent Republicans and neo-conservative ideologues (including Vice President Dick Cheney and Florida governor/first brother, Jeb Bush) organized themselves as the Project for the New American Century and began to lobby for, among other things, a regime change in Iraq. In a letter to President Clinton dated Jan. 26, 1998, they called for the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from power.<p> The letter--(still on the group's Web site at <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org" target="_new">www.newamericancentury.org</a>) was signed by Donald Rumsfeld; William Kristol, editor of the right-wing Weekly Standard and Project for the New American Century chairman; Elliott Abrams, the convicted Iran-Contra figure whom Bush appointed to the National Security Council staff; Paul Wolfowitz, now Rumsfeld's deputy, John Bolton, Colin Powell's deputy; Richard Perle, now chairman of the Pentagon's influential Defense Policy Board; Richard Armitage, another Powell deputy, Zalmay Khalilzad, former consultant for the UNOCAL oil company and the Bush administration's envoy to Afghanistan, as well as other prominent ideologues.
<p> This letter was written 3 1/2 years before Sept. 11 and long before there were tales of links between Iraq and Al Qaeda. But the link to "pre-emptive defense" is stronger than ever.<p><i>Salim Muwakkil is a senior editor at In These Times. E-mail: <a href="mailto:salim@aol.com">salim@aol.com</a></i>
