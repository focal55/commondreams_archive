<p>When British rocker Billy Bragg kicked off the Tell Us the Truth Tour in Madison, 
he expressed excitement at the prospect of visiting cities across the United States 
to raise a ruckus about White House lies and the failure of the media to expose 
them. But he did admit to entertaining one regret. <p>"I'm sorry I won't be in 
London for the protests against George Bush," Bragg exclaimed. <p>When Bush arrives 
in London tonight for an official visit to his only major ally in promoting the 
unwise and unnecessary war with Iraq, he may finally be forced to recognize that 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair does not speak for the British people. <p>On 
the eve of Bush's visit, a front page headline in London's Independent newspaper 
quoted the widow of a British soldier killed in Iraq as saying that, because of 
Bush's unproven claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, "my husband died 
in vain." <p>Former Blair Cabinet member Robin Cook said, "It is all too clear 
what Britain has done to advance U.S. foreign policy. It is hard to spot what 
President Bush has done to assist British interests." <p>And a new Gallup Poll 
showed that such sentiments are common in Britain: more than half of those polled 
said they consider the United States under Bush's leadership to be a threat to 
world peace. <p>It should come as no surprise then that mass demonstrations are 
expected. Playwright Harold Pinter, former Cabinet member Tony Benn and prominent 
members of the British Parliament will headline a "Stop Bush" rally tonight, along 
with Vietnam War veteran (and Wisconsin native) Ron Kovic, the author of "Born 
on the Fourth of July," who has flown from California to London to lead the protests. 
And a mass demonstration is planned for Wednesday, when Bush and Blair are to 
meet. <p>The Bush camp is clearly frightened by the prospect that the president 
will encounter the opposition from which he has been shielded in Washington. Bush 
aides and Secret Service officials demanded major lines on London's underground 
transportation network, the Tube, be closed during the trip, and that roads be 
closed in central London. <p>They also demanded that U.S. Air Force fighter planes 
and Black Hawk helicopters be allowed to patrol the skies over London during Bush's 
visit. And they requested "shoot-to-kill" authority that would give Bush's security 
detail immunity in cases where nonviolent protesters were killed. <p>Faced with 
outspoken objections from London Mayor Ken Livingstone, a passionate foe of the 
war, British officials dismissed the demands for extensive Tube and road closures. 
They turned down the demands for U.S. control of the air space over London. And 
British Home Secretary David Blunkett pointedly refused to grant "shoot-to-kill" 
immunity to the presidential security squads. <p>Pressured by the White House, 
Blair and his aides attempted to impose unprecedented controls on the routes of 
protesters in sections of the city where the president will be present. But, while 
Americans have come to accept extreme limits on their freedom of assembly rights, 
the British people reject such constraints on their ability to protest. <p>Thus, 
the attempt to restrict the routes of "Stop Bush" marches drew loud objections 
from the press, religious and labor leaders, and members of Parliament for Blair's 
own Labour Party. So the marches will go forward, pretty much along the planned 
routes. <p>Kovic will be at the front, telling Brits that they are not alone in 
opposing Bush's war. "I and other Vietnam vets can't help but see a mirror image 
of the Vietnam tragedy unfolding in Iraq. I think one of the most patriotic and 
democratic things a citizen can do, right now, is march against war and in favor 
of peace." <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 2003 The Capital Times <p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
