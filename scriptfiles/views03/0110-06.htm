<p>One of my cherished childhood memories is of my petite, polite mother

closing the front door firmly on two hulking FBI agents who wanted to

come in and ask her questions. "I don't have to talk to you," she

informed them in a steely voice, and she didn't. Wow, Mom! I can't swear

to all the details--were the agents really so big, or was I just little?

and did they really wear hats and trench coats, or have I dressed them

to fit the 1950s stereotype?--but I do have a distinct memory of them

casually lifting the lids from our streetside garbage cans as they left

and peering inside, like cooks checking the stockpot. I doubt they

really expected to find secret papers tossed in with the banana peels

and steak bones; they were simply making a point. After my mother died,

I sent away for her FBI file, which revealed, among other more serious

invasions of privacy, that every year the FBI would phone our house on a

pretext to make sure we still lived there. Honestly, hadn't they noticed

that the phone book has addresses too? Your government dollars at work.



</p>

<p>



But why wallow in ancient history? In the wake of September 11, spying

on citizens is back in all its careless glory. Indeed, it appears it

never really went away. For example, my old friend Barbara Levy Cohen

and her husband, Mark Cohen, are among the many represented by an ACLU

lawsuit against the Denver Police Department. The Colorado branch of the

ACLU announced last March that it had learned that the DPD had conducted

surveillance and maintained "criminal intelligence files" since the

1950s (!) on people engaged in constitutionally protected political

activities. Soon after, Mayor Wellington Webb admitted that "the issues

that have been raised by the ACLU as well as others are legitimate" and

that files existed on 3,200 individuals and 208 organizations, from the

Million Mom March to the "criminal extremist" American Friends Service

Committee, the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center and NARAL.

</p>

<p>



As always seems to be the case with police files, the Denver dossiers

are full of egregious misinformation and dark comedy. Barbara, a

serious, mild-mannered secretary who, when not organizing around Native

American and fair-trade issues, likes to read and go to the movies, is

identified as having a "direct relationship" with an "outlaw biker" gang

involved with "narcotics, weapons." (Not true, Barbara says, for the

record.) Mark's file contains a group photograph with an arrow pointing

to him--only it's not him. Margaret Taniwaki, a Japanese-American woman

who spent time as a child in a World War II internment camp in

California, is identified as "Caucasian" (maybe they meant to write

"Asian"?); her ex-husband of twenty years has a file because she drove a

car registered in his name. Sister Antonia Anthony, a 74-year-old nun

who belonged to a pro-Zapatista organization called the Chiapas

Coalition, was cited as supporting the overthrow of the Mexican

government--which would make her more of a firebrand than the Zapatistas

themselves.

</p>

<p>



But there are more serious items, too. Glenn Morris, chair of the

political science department at the University of Colorado, Denver, and

member of the leadership council of the Colorado American Indian

Movement (AIM), had a death threat listed in his files: The police knew

about it but never passed it on. While Cassandra Medrano and Pavlos

Stavropoulos were in Greece, another couple used their car to drive to

an antiglobalization demonstration; that couple's 9-year-old

child--listed as a "reliable" source in the files--gave a police officer

information about her parents that the DPD misassigned to Medrano and

Stavropoulos; using this "information," the DPD started a file on

Medrano and added to its file on Stavropoulos. Do we want to live in a

society where fourth-graders are considered reliable sources, and in

which cops probe children for information about their parents on the

basis of political beliefs and activities that are legal?

</p>

<p>



What causes do "criminal extremists" favor in Denver? Besides

reproductive rights, good works and pacifism, apparently they are keen

on Native American rights: "Of the files I've seen," Barbara tells me,

"three-quarters mention AIM and protests against Columbus Day, which is

a big issue here in Denver." The Direct Action Network, an

antiglobalization/fair trade group, also caught the inquisitorial eye:

So much so that at one point the DPD, aware that its usual infiltrators

had become familiar faces, asked a detective from the vice and drugs

control bureau to attend a DAN meeting undercover. Given such practices,

it's not surprising that another popular cause is protesting abuses of

the citizenry by the Denver Police Department. Barbara's and Mark's

files note that in 1991 they co-signed a letter published in the

<i>Colorado Statesman</i>, a local weekly, criticizing the police for

racism. Why does this classic exercise of the First Amendment belong in

secret dossiers?

</p>

<p>



Not that spying on the nonviolent would ever be right, but it's worth

noting that the Denver debacle was facilitated by the police's lack of

training in the use of the Orion Scientific Systems software program:

Crucial decisions about how to categorize and input information (what

constituted "criminal extremism," for example) were made in an

unprofessional, whimsical way. Other cities in which secret police files

have been uncovered tell a similar story of inept paranoia: Until the

mid-1980s, four years after passage of a state law barring police spying

on nonviolent political activities, Portland police kept tabs on a wide

variety of groups, including the Northwest Oregon Voter Registration

Project, a food co-op, a bicycle repair collective, a group setting up a

rape hotline and a battered women's shelter.

</p>

<p>



These days, local authorities are eager to jettison longstanding

restraints imposed after abuses in the 1970s and go back to their

old-fashioned ways. The New York City Police Department, for example,

announced that it wants to be able to spy on citizens without having to

persuade an official three-member panel that it has just cause--even

though it cited no examples of this process hindering an investigation.

In a fine twist, the NYPD plans to use an updated version of the Orion

software employed to such notable effect by the Denver PD.
