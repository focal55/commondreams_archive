<p>President Bush has been in office for a little over two years. While there
has been an enormous amount of discussion lately about a possible war with
Iraq (which I oppose), not enough is being heard about the issues that affect
the standard of living of average Americans. How have we been doing economically
since President Bush took office? What role should Congress play in improving
the economy for the middle-class and working families of our country? Some
facts:</p>
<p>Unemployment has increased to 5.6 percent, from 3.9 percent, since President
Bush took office. In the last two years, 2,365,000 jobs have been lost in
the private sector. In 2001, real median household income fell 2.2 percent,
the first decline in household earnings in a decade.</p>
<p>The trade deficit continues to rise and is now over $400 billion, including
a $100 billion trade deficit with China. More and more of the products we
buy come from abroad. In the last several years the United States has lost
1.7 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs, just under 10 percent of our
entire manufacturing workforce. Under our current disastrous trade laws,
companies are continuing to throw American workers out on the street as
they race to China, Mexico and other developing countries in search of cheap
labor.</p>
<p>Poverty is increasing. In 2001, 1.3 million more Americans slipped below
the official poverty line, the first increase in poverty since 1993. Homelessness
is also rising, as lower-income people are increasingly unable to find affordable
housing. Requests for emergency shelter increased by an average of 19 percent
in 2002, the largest annual increase since 1990.</p>
<p>The stock market continues to decline. Between Dec. 29, 2000, and the end
of the third quarter of 2002, the total market value of all U.S. equities
dropped by 38 percent — some $6.65 trillion dollars. Almost a third of households
have stock market investments through employer retirement plans. The precipitous
drop in the stock market has meant that many Americans have been forced
to postpone their retirement plans.</p>
<p>The rate of bankruptcies has skyrocketed. In the last two years the United
States has had the highest rate of bankruptcy cases in history, increasing
23 percent since 2000. Companies with hundreds of billions in assets have
filed for Chapter 11.</p>
<p>The health care crisis is getting worse. Last year health insurance premiums
increased by 12.7 percent. The average premium for families is now $7,954
a year. These cost increases, as well as the growth of unemployment, had
much to do with another 1.4 million Americans losing their health insurance
last year. Today, over 14 percent of Americans lack health insurance, and
many more are underinsured.</p>
<p>With 38 percent of those on Medicare having no prescription drug coverage,
the cost of medicine continues to skyrocket. The 50 most frequently used
drugs by seniors increased 7.8 percent — triple the inflation rate. Many
seniors are unable to afford the medicine their doctors prescribe, while
others pay for their prescriptions by cutting back on food and heat.</p>
<p>Pension and health insurance anxiety is growing among older workers and
retirees. A Bush proposal that would make it easier for corporations to
convert the pensions they promised their workers into cash balance plans
means that millions of older employees could face a substantial reduction
in the retirement benefits they had expected. Recently, bankrupt Bethlehem
Steel announced it wouldn’t be paying 95,000 workers their promised health
care and life insurance benefits.</p>
<p>The government deficit and national debt are rapidly increasing. Before
President Bush took office the government had a surplus of $127 billion
and was paying down the national debt. Now, the president’s budget for next
year calls for a deficit of more than $300 billion, and that does not include
the money that would be spent on a war and occupation of Iraq. A large deficit
could lead to massive cutbacks in Medicaid, Medicare, veterans’ needs, education
and other programs needed by millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? The president continues to believe that tax breaks
for the rich are an effective economic stimulus. I strongly disagree. I
believe that the tax breaks given to millionaires and billionaires have
more to do with campaign contributions than with job creation. Two years
ago the president provided almost 40 percent of his tax breaks to the richest
1 percent. This amounted to a $53,123 tax break for people earning more
than $373,000 a year. Now he is proposing more huge tax breaks for the very
same people, while less than 10 percent of the benefits would go to the
bottom 80 percent of wage earners.
</p>
<p>Instead of catering to the needs of the very rich, it’s high time that Congress
and the president developed policies to protect the average American. Among
many other things, we should: raise the minimum wage to a living wage; fundamentally
change our trade policies to increase manufacturing jobs; lower the cost
of prescription drugs; and establish a strong prescription drug benefit
under Medicare. We should also strengthen Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare
and veterans programs; increase funding for education and child care; and
create millions of new jobs by building affordable housing and improving
our infrastructure.
</p>
<p>The wealthy in this country are doing just fine. They don’t need more tax
breaks. It’s the rest of the people, the vast majority of Americans, who
are in economic trouble, and President Bush and Congress should start focusing
on their needs.
