<p>Let me tell you what a dead body from a war can do for a presidential nomination.

<p>It happened with two bodies out of the one war, Vietnam, and both changed American politics.

<p>One caused the worst nightmares of the Democratic Party's old worn regulars to become real yesterday. Bones were found in a grave in Laos that was the site where Howard Dean's younger brother, Charles, was killed by the communist Pathet Lao. Also found in the grave were Charles Dean's personal items.

<p>Now we have another body from the Vietnam War that affects the national politics.

<p>Suddenly, Howard Dean is not weak on the war. He is a war griever.

<p>There now seems no way for him to lose the Democratic nomination. Not only will Dean win the nomination but he will take over the Democratic Party, or whatever there is of it.

<p>I have seen it happen myself once before in my time in my business and it is almost exactly as it is with Howard Dean's campaign now.

<p>In May of 1968, Robert F. Kennedy, candidate, loudly opposing the war in Vietnam, was in a car in Indianapolis talking about the convention that was coming up in Chicago and he said, "Daley is the ball game."

<p>That was Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago, holder of all Illinois delegates, whose influence spread throughout the national party.

<p>"Daley just had a terrible death in his neighborhood," Kennedy said. "A close friend of his family was killed in Vietnam. They had a wake in the neighborhood and it hurt everyone."

<p>The young man was Joseph McKeon, a Marine, who was the son of the funeral parlor owner. McKeon's wake was on the corner of 37th and South Lowe in a neighborhood called Bridgeport. Richard Daley lived up the block, at 3536 Lowe. His son, Michael, was young McKeon's closest friend. Across from the funeral parlor was the church of Nativity of Our Lord, where McKeon was buried.

<p>The young man had attended DeLaSalle High, where Daley went, and then went to Harvard, and the Daleys were the ones loudest in pride of that.

<p>Daley was stunned by the death. He had stubbornly supported the president, Johnson, for the war. Then McKeon's body came home to a wake that nobody could take.

<p>"Hizzonor is going with Kennedy," neighborhood people said to each other at the wake and funeral. The nomination was Kennedy's.

<p>Only weeks later, Robert Kennedy was shot dead after winning the California primary. A Jordanian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot him in the head.

<p>If Robert Kennedy had stayed alive, a dead body from Vietnam would have put him into an election that he could win, against Richard Nixon.

<p>The remains this time apparently belong to Charles Dean, 24, who was captured by communist guerrillas while he was traveling down the Mekong River. The organized fighting was just through the jungles and to Vietnam. The guerrillas were in Laos. The circumstances seem to indicate they were employees of the CIA or other intelligence units. The Pathet Lao called them spies. Charles Dean was with an Australian, Neil Sharman. Sharman's brother said the two were handcuffed and executed, then thrown into a crater. U.S. Army officers report that the remains of one were found on the other and skulls, bones and shoes were found.

<p>The United States government considered Dean a prisoner of war and a Defense Department's Joint Task Force looked for the remains. Last year, Howard Dean went to Laos to visit the area where his brother was believed to have been killed.

<p>A team of Army soldiers and Laotians found the remains in Bolikhamza in the center of Laos. The remains will be flown to Hawaii in the next few weeks for the long, excruciating job of identifying them. Yesterday, Dean said, "This is painful not just for us, but for the families of every POW/MIA in America. Based on my spending time in Southeast Asia last year, I can tell you and all those families that similar efforts are being made for every family and every missing American from these Southeast Asian wars. This is an extraordinary step the government has gone to."

<p>There seems enough now. Today, they consider Dean's brother a military death and that, it says here, takes care of the nomination.

<p>I even heard on Queens Boulevard yesterday that the Queens County Democratic leader, Tom Manton, will endorse Dean.

<p>There is no way that usual politics can withstand a dead body from Vietnam. One of them should have made a President the last time, Now a second body, just the bones, but bones with an angry past, come out of the grave and into the same hideous scene, the young dying for no reason in a foreign place.

<p>This time its skull rises gloomily to perch on Howard Dean's shoulder and watch him win a nomination for president.
