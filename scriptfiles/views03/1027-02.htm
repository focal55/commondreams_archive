<p>My baseball season ended last week, when the Yankees lost the World Series. So
also ended another season of harrassment by other fans. It's not that I'm
wearing a Red Sox cap - I'm a Yankees fan through and through. But I choose
not
to stand during the singing of the national anthem or "God Bless America". For
this, I pay a price.

<p>I am opposed to nationalistic displays of any kind. Patriotism strikes me as
divisive, a kind of misplaced pride based on the geographic fluke of where one
happened to be born.  

<p>But the specific brand of nationalism displayed at Yankee Stadium in recent
years, mixed with so much military fervor, is deeply offensive to me. During
the seventh-inning stretch, Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard
exhorts fans to rise for a "moment of silent prayer" to remember the "men and
women stationed overseas who are defending our freedom [meaningful pause] and
our way of life". 

<p>This disgusts me on so many levels! First, it's not a moment of silence -
it is
a call to prayer. As an atheist, I deeply resent being directed to pray. 
Next, what exactly is this way of life being defended? Our right to invade

countries that haven't threatened the U.S.? Our freedom to drive SUVs?
Halliburton stockholders' right to maximum profit? 

<p>I would not have sent one single American to meet his or her fate in the Iraqi
desert. I see the troops as victims of a political war designed for the profit
of a select few.  

<p>Beyond all this, I don't ask "god" to bless America - I wish good things to
all
peace-loving people throughout the world. The United States doesn't deserve
the
blessings of a supreme being any more than any other place on Earth, though I
wish it would use its mighty wealth and power to bestow more blessings and
less
damage on the rest of the world.

<p>Thus, I feel that to stand during the singing of "God Bless America" is to
show
support for the Bush administration's useless war, for American military might
and for the idea of public prayer.

<p>But that's just me! I'm not asking anyone else at the Stadium to adopt my
view.
I would never try to prevent anyone from standing. I don't make noise and or
raise a sign of protest. I simply sit.

<p>For this, I have endured everything from cold stares to outright attacks.
People have made vicious comments, hurled ethnic slurs (guessing the wrong
ethnicity), anti-gay insults (wrong again!), accused me of being a communist
(three strikes), a baby-killer, a child molester and just about every other
kind of evildoer you can think of. 
The comment I hear most frequently is, "If you hate America so much, why don't
you leave?" This baffles me on two counts. One, that choosing not to stand
during the singing of a patriotic song means I hate America - when in fact I
value America because it does not <ital> require </ital> me to stand and
sing. 

<p>And two, that if you do not love every single thing about this country, if you
have any criticisms at all, that you should not live here. If people believed
that, slavery would be legal, women and African-Americans wouldn't be allowed
to vote, and - yes, baseball fans - Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays and the
Yankees' own Mariano Rivera wouldn't have been allowed to play.  

<p>The vehemence - the violence - of the reaction to my quiet sitting makes me
wonder what exactly those standing believe they are defending. If we disagree
with our elected officials, we should leave the country? (Did they leave when
Clinton was re-elected? Just wondering.) What is this freedom the armed forces
are protecting, if we are not free to sit when told to stand? I want to ask
the
people who harass me, do you love freedom - or just conformity?

<p>I wonder, is the guy who stands with his Yankees cap over his heart during
"God
Bless America" somehow "more American" than I am? What has he done for the
servicepeople in Iraq? I am an activist, working to (in my view) improve my
country, to make it more democratic, more just, more free. I also volunteer my
time to help others. Maybe the guy sitting next to me does, too - but why do I
get the feeling that he spends his days earning money to feed his family and
his evenings watching sports on TV? Yet because he stands and sings a song,
he's done his bit, and I'm a communist, baby-killing dyke.

<p>And doesn't it strike anyone as just a tad ironic that people believe I
shouldn't be <ital> allowed </ital> to sit in this wonderful free country of
ours?

<p>I ask no one else to act like me. I just don't understand why they need me to
act like them.
