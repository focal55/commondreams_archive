<p>From a mythic perspective, the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor shows an obvious desperate search for a hero. In Schwarzenegger, we have a charismatic figure with a connection to the Kennedy family, a self-made man, a machismo winner. 

<p>He is also empty, which makes it easier for us to project our illusions on him. His astonishing lack of experience and substance only make him a better poster boy, a pretty face seducing us with the message of the "winner." 

<p>What is most frightening here is the extent of the blurring between reality and illusion. The polls in California were swollen with first-time voters, many of whom were young Republicans who grew up on MTV and action flicks. In their postmodern reality, the winning strategy is often based on illusion. 

<p>As in the Iraq War, it was illusions of perceived threat that fueled America's lean-and-mean fighting machine. That is, the existence of that lean- and-mean machine was the end in and of itself; the bloody realities were airbrushed out of the picture. 

<p>And so it may be in California. Just as the predictable lack of reality in America's underestimation of Iraqi resistance and lack of world support proved to have disastrous consequences to an ancient civilization and in terms of American lives lost, so too we may see unpretty realities in California when illusion collides with reality. 


<p>What is the best medicine for this problem? Psychologists talk about withdrawing projections and rebuilding one's own inner strength. This helps us to become aware of the siren pull of spin, and perceive the real person behind the mask. It means a healthy skepticism -- would you allow your child to climb into a speeding car with a complete stranger with a pretty face? -- and trusting our own perceptions of reality. 

<p>Finally, it means acting in the face of the inevitable disillusionment -- 

taking back our power, finding our voices and expressing them in mature and disciplined political involvement.
