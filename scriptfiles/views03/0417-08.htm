<p>The United States is a land of immigrants, a land that boasts a rich assortment of cultures, religions, and languages, as well as a mixture of races. 



<p>There are old immigrants, called Americans, who have been here for many generations. They sometimes talk about their distant relatives in foreign lands, or trace their origins to these locations in a very detached way. In contrast, the newer immigrants are often homesick, talk with emotion about their relatives in their homeland, and eagerly seek the company of people from their homeland in order to alleviate some of that feeling of being away from home and all things that are familiar.



<p>There are many reasons why people immigrate to the United States. Some of these are more opportunities for personal growth, running away from an oppressive regime, following sons and daughters who have come here to build a life for themselves, and even because the grass is greener in the United States of America.      



<p>Most immigrants who step on US soil have a great desire for success. A desire that drives them to not only abandon their homeland and all that is near and dear to them, but also to leave their beloved families for their ambitions. They embrace opportunities to achieve their dreams for themselves or for their children.



<p>These immigrants proudly change their citizenships and call themselves Americans. They vote, pay taxes, and contribute to many aspects of society. They become, by all measures, good American citizens, while maintaining their strong ties with their loved ones in their old country. These ties are one of the things that make new citizens different. They make expensive calls overseas to speak to their loved ones and some send their hard-earned money and goods to their less fortunate relatives who have not been able to come to this country. These new citizens really do not take much for granted.  



<p>There is, however, a dual life for many of these citizens. They identify themselves with the country they come from, and they identify themselves as Americans. There are issues and lifestyle options that they are very uncomfortable dealing with since they conflict with their old identities. These conflicts are much worse if the immigrants have children, whose primary focus is not the old identity, but how to fit-in as real Americans.



<p>A far more confusing conflict, which is often not talked about, is loyalty. Any naturalized citizen would stand up and say that their loyalty lies with their new adopted country, but would the same citizen fight a war against his own country on the side of the Unites States? Would the same citizen sit quietly and not utter a word if the US military were to bomb his old country or implement destructive foreign policy measures towards it? 



<p>Is this what we have observed among the Muslim Arabs in the United States after 9/11 and among the Afghans who have quietly sat and watched the US military bomb their country, or among most Arabs who quietly watched the US launch a destructive unprovoked war against Iraq? What is it that is expected of these new citizens at times of such crisis? 

<p>Most new citizens do not say a word because they fear being attacked or labeled unpatriotic.



<p>These are easy questions to ask, but very hard questions to answer. When people take on new citizenships, their old selves are not erased. They are still who they were, but now can travel with different passports. They still have strong ties to their homelands and their loved ones overseas, while they love their new lives in the United States and are, by all measures, good law abiding citizens.



<p>It is all too easy to say that any person who is a US citizen should have one and only one loyalty, and that is to the United States of America. However, it is simply not possible to expect people to throw away their pasts and their ties, and recreate themselves the day they turn into US citizens. As a naturalized citizen myself, I tend to argue every side of the issue, inside my own head, but still cannot come up with a realistic and practical answer. I also know that these new citizens come from all points on the globe and carry with them different ideas and baggage. Therefore, what is acceptable to me is not necessarily acceptable to them.

<p>Some may argue that people not born in the US should not be allowed US citizenship. Even then, many US citizens would have ties overseas, maybe not nearly as strong. Dual loyalty is propagated down from generation to generation.

<p>The fact is that every new citizen should be thinking and answering these questions in ways that would not conflict with their duties as citizens of the United States of America. It is very important though that new citizens understand that their new citizenships are more than just new passports. 

<p>As American citizens, we all need to perform our duties expected of us under a democracy, which include being well-informed and participating members of the political system. We need to all be aware of our rights under the constitution of the United States and exercise those rights to shape our country’s policies both domestically as well as internationally. However, beyond all this, we need to be brave and not fear name callers, those that threaten and bully us, those who misuse their powers to intimidate us, and certainly those who question our loyalty by saying that “if you are not with us, then you are against us.” Bravery is what this nation was built upon, and as new citizens, we need to uphold this tradition. We should never have signed up if we were not up to this task.
