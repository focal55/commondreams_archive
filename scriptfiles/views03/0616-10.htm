<p>Should Americans be above international law? The United Nations Security Council seems to think so.

<p>Over Canada's principled objections, the council, by a 12-0 vote with three abstentions, has just cravenly bent to pressure from Washington, and granted Americans serving on peacekeeping missions immunity from prosecution by the U.N.'s own International Criminal Court. 

<p>This is the second toadying one-year exemption for the United States and other countries that don't accept the ICC. It undermines the court's legitimacy. It is probably unlawful. And it is unwise and unnecessary.

<p>Even peacekeepers commit crimes. A Canadian, Elvin Kyle Brown, was convicted of manslaughter and torture by Canadian military judges in the death of a Somali teenager back in 1993. He got five years. 

<p>The ICC's role is to prosecute worse offenders: Those involved in Rwanda-style genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

<p>Most nations, including Canada, accept the court's jurisdiction. 

<p>The U.S., which threatens to veto U.N. peacekeeping missions unless it has immunity despite the fact that fewer than 600 Americans are on U.N. duty, is the chief holdout.

<p>While it's hard to imagine U.N. peacekeepers involved in widespread criminal horrors, no country should be above the law.

<p>Speaking before the U.N. voted, Canadian ambassador Paul Heinbecker rightly made that point with vigor, saying it is in everyone's interest to have "a system based on law — the fair, predictable, equal application of principles agreed to by all."

<p>The Americans fret about being hauled up on frivolous charges. But they have ample protections.

<p>A U.S. peacekeeper accused of heinous crimes would face the ICC only if Washington refused to prosecute. Moreover, the Security Council has the power to block malicious, politically motivated prosecutions.

<p>But Washington's objections are ideological, not practical. It won't play by the same rules as others. And the U.N., shamefully, has buckled.
