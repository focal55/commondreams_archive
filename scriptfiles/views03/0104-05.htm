<p><i>“The entire path of Western civilization has taken humankind and the planet on a trajectory of initiation, into the state of complete alienation, into an encounter with mortality on a global scale—first with the nuclear crisis, followed by the ecological crisis. . . . It is a collective dark night of the soul, a deep separation from the community of being.”</i><br>

--Richard Tarnas

<p><i>“This is a leaderless revolution—a self-organizing movement where people are consciously taking charge of their lives. It is a clear and promising example of people growing up and taking responsibility for how their lives connect with the Earth and the future. . . . To live out of our deepest sense of purpose—integrating and balancing the inner and outer aspects of our lives—is an enormously challenging and continuously evolving process.”</i><br>

--Duane Elgin

<p>The promise of a new year! But once the celebrations are over and the resolutions are made, we still find ourselves in crisis: war and rumors of war persist, precious resources are put toward development of newfangled weaponry, the devastation of our environment continues unabated and obdurate men threaten world domination.

<p>Yet despite the chaos, confusion and uncertainty there is cause for hope. According to Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson, authors of “<a href="http://www.culturalcreatives.org/" target="_new">The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World</a>,” there are a growing number of folks in our nation and around the world who are refusing to live “divided” lives. Millions of men and women are getting in touch with their true values—personal growth, service to others, caring for the environment and others—then choosing to live these values, taking responsible action rather than merely speaking the words.



<p>I think it’s important for me to be clear about one thing at this point: I am not talking about taking on a set of rules imposed by one’s parents, a religion or some self-appointed authority. I’m talking about peeling back the years of acculturation, quieting our chattering minds and connecting with the essence of who we really are. I’m talking about connecting with our inner self (call it heart, spirit, soul, or something else) and discerning what is essential to leading a fulfilling life.

<p>Once in touch with them, living in accordance with one’s values is a process that may not take place overnight, though when we look around it appears some urgency may be in order. Nonetheless, Ray and Anderson contend that most folks may take years to fully move from identification of their values to living in a way that is congruent with them. But it is a transformation that is underway among many citizens in Asheville, the U.S. and around the world.

<p>Though it’s sometimes easy for us to believe that we are impotent in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, we can make a difference in the world. We will not think our way out of the challenges that confront us. The world will change when each of us openly embraces and lives our values. If we truly believe that no one should go without shelter and food, we are called to work to provide folks with these necessities of life. If we understand that we must live simpler lives in order to sustain our existence and the existence of other species, we are called to pare down our material desires and to find ways to walk more gently on the earth. If we acknowledge that peaceful means are the first choice for resolving conflicts, we are called to take a stand for negotiation and reconciliation.

<p>Though vitally important, your personal impact on the world may be almost imperceptible. But when many others join together, a noticeable shift occurs. When one person throws his or her stone in the pool, the water level does not appear to rise, even though it has. When millions of us throw our stones in the pool, however, the water overflows its banks in a manner that cannot be denied.

<p>If you were living in alignment with the noblest part of who you are, with your deepest values, what would you do today to make a difference?
