<p>``They're sending my daughter to 
Iraq.''
<p>
	
I'm crying as I talk to the policeman 
who stopped me for speeding just a 
few blocks from my daughter's 
apartment. ``I came here to see her 
right before she goes.''
<p>
``Don't get upset, lady,'' he says.
<p>
``I'm already upset,'' I shout at him. 
I'm bawling as I root through my 
glove compartment, hunting for my 
car registration.
<p>
``OK, OK, lady,'' he says. ``You can 
go.'' He doesn't even wait to see my 
registration. 
<p>
I've got to pull myself together, I 
think. I can't cry in front of my 
daughter, who's busy packing for an 
unspecified amount of time in that 
desert paradise, Iraq.
<p>
Her husband has been stationed 
there for three months already, and 
she's relayed all sorts of useful 
information to me, like, ``Be careful 
what kind of food you mail him, 
Mom. It's 100 degrees there. 
Someone sent him a package of 
gummy bears and by the time they 
got there, they were one big 
gummy-ball glob.'' And, ``You 
might have to send us water and 
baby wipes. Just in case we're still 
being rationed to two liters of 
drinking water a day and one 
shower a week.''
<p>
How come I haven't been hearing 
all this on the news, I wonder.
<p>
The days I spent with my daughter 
before she deployed to Iraq and the 
conversations we had are etched in 
my mind.
<p>
Her stuff is all over the apartment -- 
on the floor, tables, couch. I can 
smell their German shepherd, but 
he's no longer here. Two weeks 
ago, she drove him to her 
mother-in-law's.
<p>
I try to stay out of the way while she 
packs, so I sit in the overstuffed 
armchair her husband loves, and 
read all the articles I've printed out 
from CommonDreams.org and 
TruthOut.org and MoveOn.org 
about the low morale of the soldiers 
in Iraq, the nine Democratic 
candidates running for president 
and the lack of weapons of mass 
destruction.
<p>
I don't say a word to her about any 
of this. I'm on strict orders. She told 
me right after my arrival, ``No 
politics, Mom.''
<p>
I get up only when she needs me, 
which is mainly to help her hold her 
duffle bags tight so she can get 
them to shut. She has two giant 
duffel bags and one giant backpack. 
And she's a little 5-foot thing. But 
tough, of course. She's Army.
<p>
She plays with her new goggles, 
taking the shades in and out. 
``Sometimes the Army gets us cool 
stuff,'' she says.
<p>
``What do you want me to send 
you?'' I ask. ``Newsweek? Time?''
<p>
``No. Just People magazine,'' she 
says. ``The Army will give us the 
news. At least what they want us to 
know. Send some books, too. And 
dried peaches, apricots. The organic 
kind. I'd probably really like some 
spring water. Anything you send 
will taste good over there. I have 
enough toiletries for three months. 
After that, I'll need more. Send little 
packages. Not big ones.''
<p>
While she stuffs in some desert tan 
camouflage boots and a desert tan 
camouflage flak vest and a desert 
tan camouflage helmet, I pick up 
the handbook with the Army green 
cover and four simple letters --  
I-R-A-Q -- that's sitting on the 
coffee table next to me.
<p>
In it, there's a brief history of the 
country, a very brief glossary of 
Arabic, and page after page of 
pictures and descriptions of the 
weapons used by Iraqis. Plus some 
photos of poisonous snakes.
<p>
I close the book and go back to 
reading about how the Democratic 
senators are trying to get open 
hearings on the weapons of mass 
destruction and the Bush 
administration's pumped-up 
intelligence before the war.
<p>
``I'm almost packed,'' my daughter 
says. ``Do you want to come on my 
errands? I have to go to the base. 
Do you mind?''
<p>
It's a half-hour drive and we walk 
up and down the PX aisles trying to 
find black socks in her size. No luck. 
Then to the eyeglass store. More 
bad news. The prescription 
sunglasses she ordered aren't ready. 
She's worried about only having her 
contacts in that desert sand.
<p>
``I'll take your prescription back 
with me and mail the glasses to 
you,'' I offer.
<p>
After she's crammed the last 
package of baby wipes in her 
carry-on, it's off to the movies. My 
daughter is an avid movie fan, with 
a collection of more than 500 videos 
and DVDs, and she wants to see 
``The Hulk'' before she goes.
<p>
I usually avoid violent movies, but 
I'm in ``Support Mom'' mode. If 
she can go to Iraq, I can see ``The 
Hulk.''
<p>
I have a little trouble following the 
innuendos of the movie's plot. 
What exactly is the father shooting 
himself up with? And what exactly 
does he think will happen to his 
son? But I have no trouble realizing 
that anger makes this poor guy 
explode into a not-so-jolly, but 
kindly, green giant monster.
<p>
Surprisingly, my daughter likes the 
movie even less than I do.
<p>
``The Army isn't like that,'' she 
growls as we leave the theater. 
``They make us look like idiots. 
Soldiers wouldn't just watch the 
ones in front of them get shot up 
and then keep going and get shot, 
too. We don't follow orders 
mindlessly.''
<p>
I'm a little confused here. I thought 
the point was that they did follow 
orders. But I'm careful to keep my 
mouth shut. I can tell this isn't the 
time for a question.
<p>
When I get ready to go to sleep, she 
asks me if I can do the last of her 
laundry before I leave the next 
morning.
<p>
``And if you're still sleeping when I 
leave, I love you, Mom. Goodbye.''
<p>
``I love you too, sweetie,'' I say.
<p>
Of course, I'm up early in the 
morning. And we say goodbye 
again. I give her a big hug and she 
gives me one back.
<p>
``Be safe,'' I say.
<p>
And I do the laundry. And fold it. 
And make up her bed with it. With 
sheets she won't sleep on for who 
knows how long. And when I'm 
checking around the apartment to 
make sure I haven't forgotten 
anything, a purple button in a dish 
on her coffee table catches my eye.
<p>
It says ``Peace'' in three languages. 
Shalom. Peace. Salaam.
