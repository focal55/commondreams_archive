<p>There's a bike path that runs along the street in front of where I live. You can stand in my kitchen while sipping a cup of coffee and watch the town folk walk or jog by.<p>

The variety makes for interesting people-watching. But I like to watch the old women walk. It reminds me of my grandmother. God rest her soul.

<p>

When I was a kid visiting her in Hyannis, having left the mean streets of Oakland behind for the summer, we sometimes would walk all the way downtown from her house on Yarmouth Road.<p>

More than once, when I got tired of walking, I would get a piggy-back ride. "Rest your legs," she would say. She had the strongest hands I've ever known, men included. My grandmother was tough as nails.<p>

On the way home, we'd be walking along the sidewalk as the cars flew past us going toward the Mid-Cape Highway. Nonnie (that's what I called her) walked closest to the street. It made me feel safe.<p>

But then she would always stop and say: "Sean, when you walk with a woman, don't let her walk on the outside near the street. A gentleman walks on the outside." And then we would switch positions - until my legs needed resting, again.<p>

So ever since the invasion of Iraq began last week, I've been trying to walk more often. It usually helps me clear my mind. But these are crazy times - the fog of war, no doubt. Thoughts race through my mind like those cars that whizzed by Nonnie and me on our walks.<p>

It's been said that the first casualty of war is the truth. And I think about Ambrose Bierce's wickedly funny little book, "The Devil's Dictionary." His definition of peace? "In international affairs, a period of cheating in between two periods of fighting."<p>

I laugh, for sanity's sake. Then another thought. "The belief in the possibility of a short decisive war appears to be one of the most ancient and dangerous of human illusions," observed labor rights activist Robert Lynd.<p>

Yet another pedestrian thought. Winston Churchill. "Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace."<p>

The other day, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Donald Rumsfeld if he thought it was wise to unleash "shock and awe" on a people whose hearts and minds we are tying to win over. Doesn't it just terrify the people we are "liberating," adding to a list of sick souls who resort to the violence of the weak, which we call "terrorism"?<p>

That was the gist of his question. As serious insiders often do, Rumsfeld dismissed the idea out of hand and avoided the question by repeating how it's all Saddam's fault.<p>

Still walking. Another thought. This one from Barbara Deming: "Gandhi once declared that it was his wife who unwittingly taught him the effectiveness of nonviolence. Who better than women should know that battles can be won without resorting to physical strength."<p>

And that reminds me of a story about a grandmother and her grandson. The young boy was on vacation, but he was still given chores to do.<p>

"I've got to go to the store. I asked you to cut the grass yesterday and it's still not done. Please cut the grass before I get back," the grandmother said.<p>

"OK," said the grandson.<p>

Off to the store grandmother went. But instead of cutting the grass, the grandson decided to play wiffle ball with his buddies. Time flies when you're having fun and before the grandson knew it, two hours had passed and not a single blade of grass had been cut.<p>

Grandmother's car pulled into the yard. The grandson felt his heart sink. Suddenly, his grandmother's big strong hands flashed across his mind.<p>

"Tell your friends to go home and meet me in my bedroom," the grandmother said.<p>

Head down, the grandson walked slowly toward the bedroom, where the belt was hanging on grandmother's door.<p>

Grandmother entered the bedroom. "On your knees," she said. The grandson clenched his eyes shut, waiting for belt contact - nothing. He opened one eye to see what was going on.<p>

His grandmother wasn't holding the belt. She was on her knees, too. Her eyes were closed and her hands clasped together in prayer.<p>

And with tears streaming down her face, she cried out to God, "Lord, make a man out of him."<p>

It hurt the grandson more than the belt. He collapsed into his grandmother's arms and the two wept together.<p>

We're in a bad way, right now, ladies. We need you. You are the salvation of this world. It's that, or we men are going to have to start becoming more like women. It's Women's History Month.<p>
