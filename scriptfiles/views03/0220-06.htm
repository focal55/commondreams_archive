JUAN AND YUMI carefully wheeled their baby stroller through the huge 
crowds that squeezed along San Francisco's Market Street to protest a war in 
Iraq. Their 9-month-old baby slept soundly, unfazed by the cacophony of chants 
that filled the air.
<P>Unable to move forward, we soon struck up a conversation. "I can't vote," 
Yumi told me, "because I'm an illegal immigrant from Japan. So this is the way 
I can protest an unjust war." Juan (who asked that I change their names), was 
born in this country of Mexican parents. He is outraged by the Bush 
administration's contempt for the rest of the world. "It's unconscionable not 
to come out and demonstrate against this war. There is no immediate threat to 
our country."
<P>Brenda W., an African American social worker, jumped into the conversation. 
She had never before attended any kind of protest. "If there's a war," she 
said, "it's always poor people and minorities who fight. They're the ones who 
need the social services that are disappearing. So I decided to give up my 
Sunday and be counted."
<P>These are some of the new faces in the global anti-war movement.
<P>Last weekend, an embryonic global civil society began to raise its voice in 
protest. In 600 cities, from New Zealand to Iceland, some 8 million people, on 
six continents (seven, if you count Antarctica), said no to war. In Montreal, 
protesters shivered as the temperature dropped to minus 34 degrees; in Sao 
Paulo, they sweated under a scorching sun.
<P>Interviewed by BBC and CNN reporters, protesters everywhere responded with 
the same message: We are not anti-American; we are against Bush's pre-emptive 
war. Saddam Hussein is a monstrous dictator, but arms inspectors are crawling 
all over his country. We don't believe Bush cares about weapons of mass 
destruction; he threatens to use them in Iraq and refuses to address North 
Korea's nuclear threats.
<P>In European cities, millions of our traditional allies poured into the 
streets and said, with pride and defiance, Yes, we are Old Europe. Our land is 
soaked with blood: we've known war, we've been bombed, and we want to prevent 
the deaths of Iraqi civilians.
<P>As I watched these global protests on television, I couldn't help but 
remember the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11, 2001. I was in Norway when 
the terrorists slammed planes into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers and 
the Pentagon. The grief and sorrow expressed by Europeans were deeply moving. 
In Oslo, families with children covered blocks surrounding the American 
Embassy with heaps of flowers and mounds of toys. On a wire fence, they strung 
notes to survivors, pledging support, expressing their solidarity with the 
American people.
<P>What a difference 17 months make. So much squandered goodwill. Today, tens 
of millions of people view America as an arrogant bully. They distrust Bush's 
unilateralist policies, dislike his cowboy swagger, suspect he seeks to 
control Iraq's oil reserves and reject the leadership of an American 
government that views international treaties and law with disdain.
<P>"In only the space of two short years," Sen. Robert Byrd said on the Senate 
floor on Feb. 12, "this reckless and arrogant administration has initiated 
policies which may reap disastrous consequences for years."
<P>Some of those consequences will undoubtedly transform the political 
landscape. The prime ministers of Great Britain, Australia, Spain and Italy -- 
prominent members of Bush's "coalition of the willing" -- now ponder their 
endangered political futures. In Turkey and Pakistan, elected leaders consider 
the inconvenient fact that more than 90 percent of their citizens oppose this 
war.
<P>Last weekend, in 300 cities across this great nation, people hoisted signs 
that read "Pre-emptive Impeachment" and "Drop Bush, not Bombs." George W. Bush, too, may find his political world has changed.
