<p>The stinging review by the inspector general of his Justice Department's post-9/11 sweep of illegal immigrants is a righteous rebuke. It holds the department to stern account for a wholesale abandonment of customary due process and for excesses that bordered on cruelty. 

<P>The department says it will take the report to heart. Certainly it should, but you have to wonder if that pledge isn't just a case of making nice for the new reports. 

<P>The department's spokeswoman shrugged the findings off with the boastful and misleading comment: "We make no apologies for finding every legal way possible to protect the American public from further terrorist attacks." 

<P>That is thin cover when, at the end of the day, none of the 762 detainees &#151; not one &#151; was charged as a terrorist. 

<P>In the meantime, and for months on end &#151; the average incarceration was three months, though many were held for much longer &#151; prisoners spent weeks without ever hearing the charges against them. 

<P>Contrary to usual practice, no bonds were allowed. The prisoners were allowed only one phone call a week and tough luck to them if they got a busy signal trying to call an attorney. Many didn't have a clue about how to get legal representation anyway. 

<P>Families often couldn't find out where relatives were being held &#151; or even, officially, whether they were being detained, a twilight status eerily reminiscent of the politically "disappeared" of Latin American dictatorships. 

<P>Prisoners were locked down 23 hours a day, often with the lights kept on constantly, and in one federal prison holding 84, Inspector General Glenn Fine reports, they were subjected to "a pattern of physical and verbal abuse." 

<P>Apologists for this misbehavior say that after the terrorist attacks that killed almost 3,000, it was necessary to cut to the chase and legal niceties go hang. Most of us are in fact prepared to cede law enforcement a little slack in the circumstances, but finally there are limits. 

<P>Most detainees, all from Arab and South Asian countries &#151; a third from Pakistan &#151; were charged with immigration violations that typically are treated as minor to trivial; overstayed visas, neglected paperwork and so on. 

<P>And far from hustling to clear them of terrorist involvement, the FBI took months to conduct investigations that, if a sense of decency and humanity had prevailed, could have been done in short weeks, sometimes just in days. 

<P>There is a popular tendency to dismiss such concerns as irrelevant because, hey, these were illegals and they shouldn't have been here in the first place. But we have always granted even illegal aliens limited due-process rights and many&#151; long-time residents and initially lawful &#151; were illegal only by narrow, technical standards. 

<P>In any case, finally, this is not about who they are. It is about who we are.
