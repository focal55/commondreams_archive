<p>Just as alarming as Castro’s recent crackdown on Cuban dissent is the agenda behind Washington’s inflammatory treatment of the incident.  Since the incarceration of the dissidents, the Bush administration has worked overtime to present a warped overview of events leading up to the detentions.

 

<p>Last month, Bush declared, “Dictatorships have no place in the Americas.  May God bless the Cuban people, who are struggling for freedom.”  What he failed to mention is that, for decades, Washington has consistently stifled Cuba’s struggle for freedom and full sovereignty.  For an entire era, U.S.-sponsored, rightist dictators—such as Fulgencio Batista—sanctioned political executions and repression on the island.  The U.S. continues to violate Cuba’s right to exist by maintaining a unilateral embargo that it alone sustains.

 

<p>It is clear that the Bush administration orchestrated a series of provocations to lure Castro to overreact and crack down on island dissidents.  Since the State Department sent James Cason to serve as head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana last September, the U.S. diplomat tirelessly has organized and provided supplies to island dissidents—actions that no self-respecting government could tolerate from a country committed to destroying it.

 

<p>Washington’s goading of Castro’s paranoia with threats against his revolution does not absolve the Cuban president of responsibility for his harsh actions.  However, Castro’s decision to jail 80 suspected dissidents—and consequently to alienate an increasingly supportive European community, as well as forfeit Cuba’s chance of soon joining the EU’s Cotonou Agreement for preferential trade benefits—reflects a genuine fear on Castro’s part that Cason’s strategic liaisons with dissidents could herald another “regime change” operation by Washington.  Given the Bush administration's passion to transform a resented socialist Cuba into a Miami-led capitalist dependency, Castro's internationally condemned wave of arrests was undoubtedly the intended effect of Cason's unprecedented role as tempter.

 

<p>Castro’s imprisonment of the dissidents is condemnable.  However, it is also wrong to distort the context of the “crackdown” in order to rally support for Bush’s aim to oust the Cuban leader from power and to reverse the erosion of support in the U.S. for the increasingly unpopular embargo.  Similarly, a recent AP story quotes Ana Lázara Rodriguez, who spent 19 years following the 1959 revolution in Cuban prisons and now lives in the U.S., as saying, “we have been beaten, confined…those things continue happening in Cuba.”  But AP got it wrong.  How can a memory of a jail experience from the 1960s and ‘70s serve as a reliable verdict on current Cuban prison conditions?  Even the Cuban-American National Foundation, a virulently anti-Castro group, acknowledges that of the recent detainees, “none have complained of mistreatment.”  As the U.S. denounces Castro’s recent imprisonment of dissidents, it must be carefully noted that the international community accuses Cuba of imprisoning dissenters; not of beatings or mass executions.

 

<p>The AP is not the only source for skewed treatment of the Cuba story.  At a screening for government officials in Washington, on May 20, Miami University’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies presented “Presidio—The Trip Back,” a documentary filmed in 1998 by producer Rafael Lima. The documentary merges images of vacant prisons with the sounds of gunfire, while Lima narrates how his father and uncles were imprisoned on death row in the 1960s, having been charged by Castro authorities with the bombing of Santa Clara.  While respecting the horrific experiences that Lima must have endured as a child, one must still keep an eye on the film’s political mission, which was made fully evident at its recent Rayburn House Office Building showing. Considering the way that he merged accounts of imprisonments and executions that occurred throughout 18th century Spanish rule, and during the transition from Batista to the Castro government, along with limited, more recent footage, some in the audience probably left thinking that the dissidents are currently being starved, tortured, and summarily executed.  

 

<p>Sensationalizing Castro’s crackdown to justify more aggressive meddling in Cuban affairs will not help to “free the people of Cuba.”  If Washington truly valued Cuban freedom, it would stop using economic sanctions and political connivance to bully Cuba into submitting to the U.S.'s global reach. Although many Cubans express a craving for greater freedom of expression, most of them also communicate a desire to reform their society from within, free from U.S. intrusion.
