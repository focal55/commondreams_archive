<p>There&#39;s a troubling news bit that keeps spinning in my head like a pinwheel in a gale. It&#39;s left over from that all-but-forgotten foray into Afghanistan last spring when we missed Osama but did a lot else that felt pretty good -- if hearing rock music in the streets of Kandahar makes you feel good. OK, there&#39;s more to it than that, and I am delighted that the Taliban thugs were routed, even if our promised follow-up has been lacking. I understand; we have to move on to Iraq. Well, I don&#39;t, but let&#39;s leave that for now.</P>

<P>It&#39;s the story of the two U.S. F-16 pilots, flying over Afghanistan in April, who mistakenly bombed and killed four Canadian soldiers and injured eight others. An Air Force judge in Louisiana is conducting a hearing to determine if Maj. Harry Schmidt and Maj. William Umbach should be court-martialed on charges of involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault and dereliction of duty. </P>

<P>All of Canada is riveted on the case, rightfully outraged by the first combat-zone deaths of Canadian soldiers in over 50 years, at the hands of their own allies. But should their outrage be directed at the pilots or at the policies of the U.S. Air Force? Because another story has been brought to light in this sad misadventure. </P>

<P>The pilots, both majors in the Illinois Air National Guard and not full-time flyboys, were cruising around in bomb-laden fighter planes while jacked up on amphetamines. Grounds for court-martial? Nope, it seems Dexedrine -- called "go-pills" by the military -- is routinely dispensed, even encouraged, by the Air Force to keep fatigued pilots awake on lengthy missions. "No-go pills," sedatives like Ambien and Restoril, are served up to handle those troublesome combat-related sleep issues.</P>

<P>That day, both Schmidt and Umbach were working a 20-hour shift and took the prescribed Dexedrine. They say they felt that they would be scrubbed from the mission if they declined. The Air Force argues that fatigued pilots need the amphetamines to stay alert, and one can&#39;t dispute that dozing off at the helm of an F-16 ought to be discouraged. But anyone who ever spent a tooth-grinding night in college cramming for an exam while on "Dex" knows that the resulting high-wire jitters are a lousy substitute for clarity and sound judgment. </P>

<P>My issue is not with the pilots, who thought they were being attacked, although their superiors and the Canadians contend that they were reckless and trigger-happy -- that they did not wait for ground communication before unloading the 500-pound bomb that killed their compatriots. The Air Force judge will have to resolve that debate.</P>

<P>What&#39;s bothering me is the hypocritical policy of the Air Force, particularly in light of our government&#39;s war on drugs. Figures from the Office of the National Drug Control Policy indicate that the federal government will spend more than &#36;19.2 billion on the war on drugs this year, and state and local governments will spend at least another &#36;20 billion. According to the FBI, 1,579,566 people were arrested in 2000 for drug law violations, 46 percent of them for cannabis. All other considerations aside, can we afford this with our wobbly economy?</P>

<P>Amphetamines are illegal unless prescribed. Over time they can be addictive and lead to side effects such as anxiety, paranoia and heart problems. Civilian pilots are prohibited from using them, as are train engineers, freighter captains and just about anyone driving anything bigger than a skateboard. Any employers who were found to have a policy of dispensing speed to their overtired drivers would be prosecuted.</P>

<P>Yet the Air Force encourages its pilots to "Just Say Yes" and defends its questionable habit.</P>

<P>The pilots&#39; lawyers also argue that there were communication glitches that night which high-ranking commanders had failed to address despite earlier warnings. ABC News reports that classified documents confirm that ominous but unheeded warnings had been given by officers to the high command: "No one on same page, safety measures not taken or understood, Theater Air control system not functional." </P>

<P>If President Bush goes ahead with this ill-begotten war on Iraq he should at least be able to guarantee the American people, our troops and our allies that our much-touted technical wizardry is up to speed. And that our pilots are up without it. The photos of the four killed Canadians grab your heart. Their eyes are alert, smiling, penetrating -- what you&#39;d expect from young, dutiful soldiers. </P>

<P>Unless Bush changes his war plan soon we&#39;d better prepare ourselves for hundreds and thousands more photos of faces like these -- Canadian or Brit, American or Iraqi. Whether killed by "friendly fire" (now, there&#39;s an oxymoron) or "enemy fire," by tired pilots or alert ones, they&#39;ll all be equally dead. And no judge&#39;s ruling will mitigate the grief.</P>
