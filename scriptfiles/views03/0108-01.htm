<p>Some two decades ago, I served at the American Embassy in Oslo. I 

traveled extensively through Norway and met hundreds of Norwegians. Positive 

feelings toward America reigned.

<P>At that time, the United States' historical regard for the rule of 

international law and for human rights stood in sharp contrast to the policies 

of the Soviet Union.

<P>Five years ago, I returned to Norway as a Fulbright scholar. Most 

Norwegians then still considered America the hope of the world. They felt 

great pride in their role in formulating the Oslo Accords and valued the 

efforts of the United States in furthering the Middle East peace process.

<P>Last month, I traveled again to Norway. How things have changed!

<P>The area around the American Embassy in Oslo resembles a war zone, with the 

streets rolled up to prevent hostile demonstrations. While Norwegians are 

still polite with American visitors, they are no longer welcoming.

<P>Most Norwegians are horrified by elements of American foreign policy. 

According to a recent poll published in Aftenposten, Norway's conservative 

newspaper of record, 75 percent of all Norwegians now hold a negative view of 

the United States. This percentage holds true not only for voters on the left, 

but, surprisingly, equally for political conservatives, traditionally staunch 

supporters of America.

<P>There are many reasons for this dramatic shift.

<P>The Oslo Accords, the pride of Norwegian foreign policy, are in shambles. 

In Norwegian eyes, the Bush administration, in concert with Israel's Likud 

party, tacitly participated in their demise.

<P>"The USA," Aftenposten explains, "exploits international agreements when 

they support American policy, but arrogantly dismisses those that it dislikes."

<P>The looming attack on Iraq is almost universally opposed. When, after 

arduous diplomacy, the United Nations returned inspectors to Iraq, Norwegians 

hoped that war might be averted. But Washington's subsequent scorn of the 

inspection process, its dismissal of every conciliatory gesture from Baghdad, 

and its incessant bombing of Iraqi air-defense sites, is seen as aggressive 

warmongering.

<P>Then the Bush administration, citing fears of nuclear proliferation, 

refused to let Norway, and other temporary members of the U.N. Security 

Council, receive Baghdad's complete weapons report. Norway, long an advocate 

of nuclear-free zones and disarmament, was deeply insulted.

<P>Does this small, northern European country matter? In the world of 

realpolitik, probably not.

<P>But the sudden plummet in Norway's regard for America should set off alarm 

bells in Washington. Like the canary in the mine shaft, Norway is small and 

inconsequential. But when the plucky bird ceases to sing, something noxious 

and foul is in the air.
