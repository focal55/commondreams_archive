<p>When television and I were in our naive infancy, my favorite program was Robin Hood.  I was not alone. 
<p>For those of you born yesterday, Robin Hood was not about flour. 
<p>Robin and his Merry Men gamboled through the verdant black and white forests of the small phosphor screen, liberating wealth from the rich and restoring it to the poor, whose back-breaking work created it in the first place, by God! 
<p>Snigger away.  The idea had popular appeal back then. 
<p>Robin’s arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham, would stop at nothing to apprehend the renegades and restore order.  In his knobby chain mail, the Sheriff snarled, pounded the table, and armed his troops with the highest tech crossbows.  He spared no treachery.  Oddly, though, the bad guys could never shoot straight. 
<p>Robin cut a colorful figure in black and white.  He had no need of armor, so nimble was he at dodging arrows...a sort of Tarzan of the northern forest.  He wore something boys of the fifties wouldn’t be caught dead in, except when playing Robin Hood:  sort of an elfy affair with a pointy fringe which you knew was two shades of green suede, not just light and dark gray.  His men used long bows, like Real Men, and hit their targets every time, only they contented themselves with pinning enemies to trees by their clothing with well-placed, comical shots.  Maybe my memory serves me ill, but I associate the Sheriff with grumpy mayhem and Robin with humor and good sportedness...tantamount to pacifism. 
<p>Ah yes, there was Maid Marianne, a heroine with the beauty of Helen of Troy, the purity of the Virgin Mary, and the cunning of Robin himself...only in a second-class female sort of way, of course.  She too often contrived to place herself in danger, forcing Robin to greater risks out of sheer gallantry...or was it love—maybe for the older viewers. 
<p>Friar Tuck and Little John completed the crew.  The Friar sided with justice, though he didn’t live in the woods with the good guys.  He consorted with the rich, or at least the townies, keeping his ear to the ground and more often than not saving Robin with his timely discoveries. 
<p>Little John was large and loyal where the Friar was merely fat, and had a heart just as big.  Little John was earthbound while Robin bounced about, his strength and good timing highly useful when Robin got in deep trouble just before commercial breaks. 
<p>Wow!  What a show! 
<p>These guys were heroes—really—and the Sheriff was bad big time, and they made us into who we became:  weak-minded sixties liberals. 
<p>Of course, liberals are out, and a remake set in Washington today would have to be sanitized to neo-conservative standards. 
<p>Robin Hood and his Merry Men are classic terrorist material.   They don’t laugh when they steal, they’ll cut your throat if given half a chance,  and they’re mostly foreign.  They lurk in dark alleys.  They hate our American way of life, folks.  They hate us because we are free.  They will steal your oil, your cars, your wallet, and your future to serve the weak and poor worldwide, God help us. 
<p>The Sheriff wears a suit with a flag pin and lives on Pennsylvania Avenue.  He smirks a lot while making the rich richer and the poor destitute.  His crossbows are fancier, and he uses them worldwide to bring cash home for his pals.  He’s our hero. 
<p>Friar Tuck and Little John retain their parts.  The Friar was into Liberation Theology once, but has found tele-evangelism.  He coordinates faith-based initiatives in the United States and Christian conversion drives in heathen Islamic countries.  He tips the Sheriff off when the poor plot for justice.  Meanwhile, Little John keeps an eye on the folks at home, listening in on phone conversations, opening mail, jailing suspected Merry Men without trial, and clothing bare-breasted statues. 
<p>Steal from the poor and give to the rich!  Ya gotta love it!
