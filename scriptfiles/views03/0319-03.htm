<p>War is imminent, an act of insanity by a man who was not elected by a 

majority of American voters and who is influenced by a gaggle of ideologues 

who apparently want America to take over the world with the most dazzling 

array of high-tech weapons in history.

<P>Grassroots peace marches and vigils aren't making a difference to the 

Washington warmongers. It's really a different-looking protest crowd, not just 

the great unwashed of the Vietnam War-era, but soccer moms and their children, 

as well as white-haired women comfortable in their Saks Fifth Avenue outfits.

<P>This is a melancholic moment for me. I am thinking about the strange 

juxtaposition of some celebratory moments for Asian Americans, for example, 

and the impending war.

<P>In recent days, there's been a flood of laudatory articles in The Chronicle 

about the opening of the Asian Art Museum. In about a week, PBS will broadcast 

a three-part series applauding Chinese Americans for "making it," despite a 

history of racism and discrimination. For many Asian Americans, these are good 

times, if the kind of mainstream media and cultural attention represented by 

the Asian Art Museum and Bill Moyers' approval are a measure.

<P>I recently got a plea from an upscale Asian American group to join the 

Asian Art Museum (for $125) so that I could be part of the crowd in a special 

preview. I read a newspaper account about a glittery preview evening at the 

museum, where Asian and non-Asian partygoers went all out, wearing all manner 

of "native, ethnic" outfits -- silk this, brocade that.

<P>I chose not to join the Asian Art Museum, thus forgoing an opportunity to 

hobnob with my well-to-do brethren and their well-coiffed and bejeweled 

spouses, to say nothing of the best and brightest of the San Francisco social 

scene bedecked in, presumably, form-fitting cheongsams and silk jackets.

<P>Instead, I have chosen to bear quiet witness in peace marches and vigils. 

In one San Francisco march, I noticed a sprinkling of Asian faces, mostly 

youngish (20s and 30s). I know other Asian Americans have long been active in 

the peace movement, including my sister Nellie Wong, a renowned poet and 

socialist; acclaimed writer Maxine Hong Kingston and civil-rights activist 

Yuri Kochiyama. In a smaller demonstration, however, I saw only three other 

Asian faces in a crowd that was mostly white.

<P>I don't mean to ignite a class war among us yellows and don't want to 

disrespect the visionaries, organizers and supporters of such cultural 

institutions as the Asian Art Museum or PBS. Perhaps the timing is unfortunate 

that mainstream cultural events are focused on Asians and Asian Americans just 

as our mighty nation is about to bomb to smithereens a society that has 

descended from the cradle of civilization. Maybe it's an accident of history 

that that once mighty civilization is now led by a madman of its own, Saddam 

Hussein. That alone, however, does not justify what our own madman is about to 

do.

<P>I challenge my Asian brothers and sisters to reorder their priorities, as 

hard as that may be to do at a time when mainstream America, which has 

profoundly disrespected us, seems to be infatuated with us. Celebrate the 

Asian Art Museum. Feel good that PBS is saying nice things about us. But delve 

deeply into your own conscience to discover what you feel about what our 

nation is about to do to countless thousands of innocent people in Iraq.
