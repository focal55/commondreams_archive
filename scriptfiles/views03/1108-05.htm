<p>It would take some chutzpah for me to accuse President Bush, Congressional 
Democrats and a courageous Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident of bolstering some 
of the world's most odious dictators. <p>But here goes. <p>The Bush administration 
has variously backed, threatened, acquiesced in or hinted at tough new sanctions 
against Cuba, Syria, North Korea and Burma. Democrats helped lead the fight for 
a new ban on imports from Burma. And the gutsy Nobel laureate from Burma, Daw 
Aung San Suu Kyi, backs sanctions that help impoverish her own people. <p>The 
U.S. imposed 85 new unilateral economic sanctions on foreign nations from 1996 
to 2001. But sanctions, which cost U.S. companies up to $19 billion in 1995 alone, 
aren't a policy; they're a feel-good substitute for one. Usually they hurt just 
the people we're trying to help. <p>Fortunately, the Senate last month joined 
the House in voting to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba. There is now some 
hope that the U.S. will dismantle the Cuba sanctions, which have hurt ordinary 
Cubans while helping Fidel Castro, giving him a scapegoat for his economic failures. 
<p>Take Burma (or Myanmar, as its thuggish generals have tried to rename it). 
Republicans and Democrats alike approved tough new sanctions against Burma this 
year, by a vote of 97 to 1 in the Senate. <p>The reality is that Western sanctions 
have already been failing in Burma for the last 14 years, as they have for more 
than 40 years in Cuba, as they did for a dozen years in Iraq. We should have learned 
from Iraq that arms embargoes and U.N. inspections can do some good, while economic 
sanctions kill children. The claim that sanctions killed 500,000 Iraqi children, 
a figure that originated in a Unicef report, was probably exaggerated, but no 
one doubts that U.N. sanctions contributed to child malnutrition and mortality 
in Iraq. <p>The U.S. State Department says in a new report that our July ban on 
Burmese imports has already led to 30,000 to 40,000 layoffs in the garment industry, 
and that ultimately 100,000 Burmese may lose jobs. Most of them are young women 
who have no other way of earning a living, and the State Department says that 
some are being forced, or duped, into prostitution (where many will be killed 
by AIDS). <p>"We do believe that some of those young women have gone into the 
sex trade," said Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, although he 
defended sanctions and said that they would eventually make life better in Burma. 
So in the best-case scenario, we're ousting 100,000 people from their jobs — while 
the generals keep theirs. <p>The Burmese are already living on the margins: one 
child in 10 dies before the age of 5, 44 percent of children are malnourished, 
and 58 percent of pregnant women are so poorly fed that they have anemia. Fewer 
births are attended by a trained nurse now than back in 1982. <p>So our sanctions 
will cause babies to die, young women to succumb to AIDS and families to go hungry. 
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has shown exceptional courage in standing up to Burma's 
generals and the harm they cause. She should also be brave enough to back down 
and call for ending sanctions that hurt her people. <p>If we knew that sanctions 
would lead to a better Burma, I could understand sacrificing helpless young women. 
But when sanctions, especially unilateral ones, are mostly ineffective — one major 
study found that they worked to some degree one-third of the time — why are we 
so eager to adopt measures that impose such suffering on innocent Burmese, or 
Cubans or Syrians? <p>In fairness, I was also skeptical of sanctions against South 
Africa, and in retrospect I was wrong: partly because they were multilateral, 
they were one of many factors that led to peaceful change there. But in the more 
typical cases of Iraq, Haiti, Cuba and North Korea, sanctions have seemed only 
to empower dictators. And when dictatorships crumbled in places like Indonesia, 
Taiwan, South Korea, Brazil, Spain and Portugal, it was because growing wealth 
nurtured a middle class, not because of sanctions. <p>That's why I fervently hope 
that Congress's push for easier travel to Cuba marks a sea change in attitudes 
toward sanctions. They are ill suited to a complex world where a senator can nobly 
stand before the cameras to denounce Burmese tyrants, and the upshot is that a 
child on the other side of the world dies of hunger. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright
