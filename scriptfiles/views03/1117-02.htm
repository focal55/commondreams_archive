<p>The green-gold expanse of savanna; above it, the purple horizon-hiding haze; 
and above that, like a pyramid improbably suspended in the sky, the snows of Kilimanjaro. 

<p>"Great, high and unbelievably white in the sun," as Hemingway wrote, the continent 
of Africa — some would say our planet itself — has hardly anything to show more 
fair. <p>But the show could soon be over. The summit of Kilimanjaro is losing 
its ice so quickly that it could be barren dirt before the next decade is out. 
When the ice goes, it will take with it an irreplaceable 10-millennium record 
of the African climate, a profitable tourist attraction and a source of beauty 
that is a joy to contemplate. <p>At first sight, the loss of Kilimanjaro's ice 
doesn't look like the sort of thing anyone could do much to stop. The mountain's 
year-round ice is mostly to be found in a handful of fields around the volcano's 
central crater. Though snow comes and goes from the mountain's flanks with the 
seasons, these summit ice fields have been shrinking for more than a century; 
from 1912 to 2000 four-fifths of their area vanished. <p>It is not clear that 
global warming is responsible for this precipitous retreat (retreating glaciers 
elsewhere, like those in the Alps, offer much more convincing smoking guns). But 
that does not clear humans of blame. <p>After all, it is reasonably suspicious 
that, after persisting for more than a hundred centuries, the ice began to vanish 
in the very century in which humans started to change the environment both globally 
and, perhaps more important, locally. It may well be that a regional change of 
some sort — deforestation, in all likelihood — has dried out the moist, rising 
winds that used to replenish the ice. <p>The question of what is destroying the 
ice, though, is less pressing than the question of whether anything can be done 
to save it. And the surprising answer to the second question is yes. You see, 
the two main ice fields on top of Kilimanjaro are big flat slabs with cliff-like 
faces. <p>According to scientists studying the mountain, it is melting from these 
cliffs — rather than from the flat tops of the fields — that seems to be the key 
to the problem. <p>Reading about this, Euan Nisbet, a Zimbabwean greenhouse gas 
specialist at The Royal Holloway College, University of London, was struck by 
a fairly simple solution: drape the cliffs in white polypropylene fabric. Sunlight 
bounces off, and the ice below stays cool. The result would look like a giant 
washing line: God's crisp, white sheets aired out three miles up in the sky. <p>Mr. 
Nisbet, whose family tree is thick with foresters, stresses that he doesn't see 
this as a permanent solution — but it would buy some decades, even a century, 
during which ways could be found to develop reforestation plans good for the mountain 
and the people who live beneath it. <p>The task of protecting the ice, while monumental, 
would not be impossible; the relatively small size of the ice fields is, after 
all, the whole point. In principle it would be well within the grasp of the world's 
grandmaster wrapper, Christo. "Running Fence," the Christo masterpiece that snaked 
through 25 miles of Sonoma and Marin Counties in California for a couple of weeks 
in 1976, would be easily long enough to girdle the two main ice fields. <p>Given 
that the cliffs are 60 to 150 feet high, their covering would have to be taller 
than "Running Fence"; but the total amount of fabric required would probably be 
no greater than that used for the bright pink skirts Christo spread out around 
the islands in Miami's Biscayne Bay in 1983. <p>Indeed, Christo and his wife and 
partner, Jeanne-Claude, would make good consultants for the project; the team 
that convinced German parliamentarians to let them wrap the Reichstag might well 
persuade the Tanzanian government to allow the same thing to be done to the country's 
best-known feature. <p>Getting hundreds of thousands of square yards of fabric 
to the mountain top would be fairly easy — pack it up tightly and throw it out 
the back of a transport plane. Hanging it off the ice cliffs would be tricky, 
and require a lot of help. But it is hard to imagine that, if the money for such 
a project were to be found, the volunteers would not come running from around 

the world. And once the hanging is done, the main job would be over. <p>The rest 
of the preservation effort might just consist of a few snow machines to keep the 
top surface fresh and white in the months when no snow falls. The fresher the 
ice the more sunlight it reflects; the less light absorbed, the less the ice will 
melt. <p>The effort to preserve a square mile of ice in the equatorial sky could 
become a powerful local and universal symbol. Cloaking the ice cliffs of Kilimanjaro 
would not just borrow the techniques of an art installation — it would be a work 
of art in itself. Done properly, it would be a preservation of beauty that is 
itself, beautiful. <p>What's more, preserving the ice would be a way of saying 
that we do not have to accept environmental change, even when it looks inevitable. 
The white tarps would float above the clouds a tentative hope: the hope that human 
will and ingenuity just might be able to meet the challenges of a century in which 
more change will be faced, and more protection needed, than at any other time 
in human history — or Kilimanjaro's. <p><I>Oliver Morton is author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/031242261X/commondreams-20" target="_new">Mapping
