<p>Rush Limbaugh is a hero to some and a big fat idiot to others. His standing in the eyes of many may change with his admission last week that he is addicted to painkillers and that he would check into a treatment center for 30 days to "break the hold this highly addictive medication has on me." 



<p>But when it comes to the criminal investigation of him for allegedly buying thousands of prescription painkillers, his politics are irrelevant. As long as no one else was harmed as a consequence of his drug use, Rush Limbaugh should not face incarceration or be punished for what he chose to ingest in his own body. Neither should any other American, regardless of class, age or race. 



<p>Limbaugh is not the first well-known Floridian to land in hot water over prescription-drug abuse. Gov. Jeb Bush's daughter, Noelle, was arrested in 2002 for trying to buy Xanax with a fake prescription. At the time, the Drug Policy Alliance called for privacy for the Bushes, but also pointed out the discrepancy in Florida's treatment of drug abuse among people with less political power and financial means. For the past 10 years, more have been sentenced to Florida state prisons for drug offenses than for any other offense. The cases of Noelle Bush and now Rush Limbaugh remind us that substance-abuse problems do not discriminate. Unfortunately, thanks to Gov. Bush, Florida's drug policies still do. 



<p>Despite this personal encounter with drug abuse in the family and repeated calls for reform, Gov. Bush has cut drug-treatment and drug-court budgets in Florida. He also staunchly opposed a possible ballot initiative that would have diverted nonviolent drug offenders away from prison. Treat others as you would want your own son or daughter treated, we said. It's a good principle in life, and a sound basis for drug policy. Gov. Bush didn't listen. 



<p>It is unclear where Limbaugh stands on drug policy. In 1995 he told his radio talk-show listeners: "There's nothing good about drug use. We know it. It destroys individuals. It destroys families. Drug use destroys societies. Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country.... And so, if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up." Limbaugh went on to deny that African Americans are incarcerated more often than whites as a result of the war on drugs. The answer to any such disparity, he said, was to catch more white drug users, "convict them and send them up the river, too." 



<p>In 1998, Limbaugh had a dramatically different message. "What is missing in the drug fight," he told a listener, "is legalization. If we want to go after drugs with the same fervor and intensity with which we go after cigarettes, let's legalize drugs. Legalize the manufacture of drugs. License the Cali cartel." 



<p>Sarcasm? Perhaps, but I hope not. I hope, in fact, that his experience with the law further opens Limbaugh's eyes to the plight of the hundreds of thousands of nonviolent drug offenders behind bars in this country. I would be happy to welcome him to the growing national movement for drug-policy reform. We need all the help we can get. 



<p>But first and foremost, I hope Limbaugh's life isn't destroyed by unjust, unscientific and uncompassionate drug laws. No one deserves that, friend or foe.
