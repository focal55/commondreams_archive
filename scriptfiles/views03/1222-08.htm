<p>The system of self-government that we inherited from the Founding Fathers is badly in need of repair. If we are worthy heirs of their work, we'll fix it. But so far we show no sign of doing so.

<p>The symptoms of decline are many, but here may be the most stunning: Last year, of the 435 congressional seats across the country, only four challengers managed to defeat an incumbent. That means one of two things: Either we have a happy and contented electorate, perfectly satisfied with its political leadership, or something has gone afoul with the system. Personally, I lean toward the latter conclusion. The drafters of the Constitution did not intend the U.S. House of Representatives, with its two-year terms, to be a static body with little or no competition for membership, but that is clearly what it has become.

<p>The natural advantages of incumbency simply can't account for the disappearance of effective political competition, not just in the U.S. House but in most state legislative races as well. The better explanation lies with technology, more specifically the introduction of computer software programs that give politicians, not voters, the power to determine who gets elected.

<p>Armed with polling information, voting records, maps, party registration and the range of household and personal data now available, consultants can identify Democratic and Republican voters and where they live with alarming precision. It is then child's play to draw grotesque maps that cram Democrats together with Democrats and Republicans with Republicans, setting up districts all but guaranteed to elect politicians of a given party.

<p>In addition to protecting incumbents, that system has had a couple of other notable effects. In districts dominated by a particular party, representatives have no need to seek crossover votes or appeal to the sensible middle. They instead are free to play to either fringe. In fact, the only danger of defeat in such districts comes from within the dominant party, during a primary, a fact that forces conservatives to become more conservative and liberals to become more liberal.

<p>This is not a healthy situation. It produces a political system that discourages cooperation and moderation, promotes extremism, and takes power away from the voter and places it in the hands of political operatives.

<p>So, what are we going to do about it?

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard a case out of Pennsylvania, Vieth v. Jubelirer, that asks the court to prevent extreme cases of district-packing on grounds that it dilutes the power of a person's vote. But as several justices suggested during oral arguments, it is difficult to imagine how the courts could craft a legally defensible solution to the problem.

<p>That's just as well, because this is a problem that the American people ought to fix themselves. The solution is relatively simple and elegant and has been pioneered by the state of Iowa. Congressional and legislative districts there are drawn by a nonpartisan commission forbidden to consider political leanings. The result is an orderly political map that looks less like paint drippings and more like bricks stacked atop each other. More importantly, Iowa has more competitive races than anywhere else in the country, as well as a moderate congressional delegation.

<p>Despite its success, the Iowa model has not been duplicated, largely because politicians are not going to voluntarily return the power that computerized redistricting has allowed them to seize. If the American voter wants to reclaim that power -- if the health of our democracy matters to us -- we'll have to force a change through some sort of national crusade, along the lines of the term-limit movement.

<p>That movement eventually fell short because it offered a flawed solution, artificially limiting the voters' power to elect who they wished. Insisting on sanity in redistricting would do the opposite -- expanding voter choice and encouraging more responsible, responsive leadership. In this era of cheap talk about patriotism, there is nothing more true to the American spirit than taking back power. We simply have to stir ourselves enough to do it.
