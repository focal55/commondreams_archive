<p>Victor Berger, the great radical congressman from Milwaukee, proposed in the early years of the past century that the United States Senate be eliminated. 

<p>Berger's rationale was sound: The Senate was America's version of the English House of Lords, its arcane rules and procedures were antithetical to the rough-and-tumble of American democracy, and its members were not elected based on any reasonable principle of popular representation - since a senator from a state with 300,000 people had a vote that was equal to a senator representing a state with 3 million citizens. 

<p>Berger's proposal, which required support from the Senate to advance, went nowhere. And the likelihood that the United States will lose the upper house of its Congress anytime soon is beyond remote. 

<p>Yet it can be argued that the Senate is an even harder-to-defend chamber today than it was in Berger's day. 

<p>In the first decades of the 20th century, senators like Robert M. La Follette, Hiram Johnson, Gerald Nye, Burton K. Wheeler, George Norris, T.P. Gore, John Blaine and William Borah were larger-than-life figures who commanded the respect not just of Americans but of the world. Indeed, it is recalled that, during the presidency of Herbert Hoover, U.S. diplomats who met with their European counterparts found that their reports of Hoover's latest pronouncements were dismissed as inconsequential. "What does Borah say?" the Europeans would ask, well aware that the Idaho senator was a more definitional figure than the chief executive when it came to international affairs. 


<p>That was as the founders of the country intended it. But that is no longer the case. 

<p>Carrying on a pattern that has extended at least from the days of Lyndon Johnson, George W. Bush has seized so much say over U.S. foreign policy that the Senate is, today, about as relevant as the House of Lords. 

<p>The Senate can give a known fraud a hard time, as Wisconsin's Russ Feingold and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee did when Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee in July. 

<p>But don't look to this Senate to actually say "no" to a president's imperialist initiatives in the way that the Senate frequently did from 1924 until 1933, when Borah, a progressive Republican like La Follette, chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. 

<p>Borah, La Follette and the other lions of the Senate would almost certainly have prevented George W. Bush from manipulating the country into war with Iraq. And they would never have allowed him to get away with avoiding questions about the cost of that misguided endeavor. 

<p>The Bush administration has refused to provide projections regarding the likely cost of maintaining the occupation of Iraq, even after members of the Senate requested the information. Now that private analysts say the price tag is likely to hit $600 billion, the pressure for answers will increase. 

<p>But don't bet that the administration will be forthcoming anytime soon. Aside from West Virginia's Robert Byrd, Feingold and a handful of others, the Senate is suffering from a severe shortage of the intellect and independence that defined it in the chamber's heyday. And there are no members of the president's party who have the courage to challenge the chief executive as a Robert M. La Follette or a William Borah did. 

<p>When Republican Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover started getting militaristic ambitions in Latin America or elsewhere - usually at the behest of Wall Street - Borah, as the chairman of relevant Senate committees, would demand facts and figures. And, more frequently than not, he would tell the chief executives they lacked the authority to go adventuring abroad. 

<p>Borah argued that America should provide leadership in the world "as a great moral force, disentangled." He favored a foreign policy that was anti-militarist, noninterventionist and subject, always, to public debate and public opinion. 

<p>The purpose of the military was to defend the United States from attack, nothing more, said Borah. Rejecting foreign military or economic alliances, Borah said, America could only lead through "a creed of international honor, morality, decency and justice." And, with the aid of Wisconsin senators such as La Follette and John Blaine, he made presidents of his own party pay deference to that creed. 

<p>That it is now beyond imagination that a Republican senator would so challenge Bush may be the best argument for taking up Victor Berger's dusty old proposal. Maybe the Senate has outlived its usefulness.
