<p>Here's the prewar zeitgeist in a nutshell: In a widely
reported January 16 speech, Tony Blair proclaimed that
the impending invasion of Iraq "has nothing to do with
oil, or any of the other conspiracy theories put
forward."
<p>One week later, Sen. Richard Lugar, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, quietly passed
word to Russia and France that their countries will be
frozen out of staggeringly lucrative postwar oil
contracts unless they roll over and endorse the US
attack.
<p>Yes, Tony, there is a conspiracy, in the dictionary
sense of the term: an agreement among people to
perform a criminal or wrongful act. It consists, not
of a tiny cabal, but of the whole of the American
power elite, from politicians to business executives
to journalists. It has everything to do with oil. But
it is not secret.
<p>The conspirators know they can count on the uncritical
support of the mass media. Therefore knowledge of
their cynical motives and thuggish tactics can be made available in journals and other specialized fora, all but invisible to most Americans but accessible to the few with sufficient time and inclination to dig beneath the headlines.
<p>Building on that knowledge, a Mumbai-based independent
think tank has now anatomized the conspiracy behind
the coming war and issued a truly comprehensive
explanation of the current global crisis.
<p>Behind the Invasion of Iraq, the startling new
book-length report authored by the Research Unit for
Political Economy (RUPE), synthesizes the seemingly
disparate threads of the US war drive in what amounts
to a blistering indictment of American foreign policy.
The report (available on the Web at
  <a href="http://www.rupe-india.org" target="_new">www.rupe-india.org</a>) is lavishly documented and
jargon-free; the effect, especially for readers with
limited understanding of global commerce and finance,
is of puzzle pieces clicking decisively into place.

<p>The RUPE report wholly confirms the widely-held view
of the coming war as a massive oil grab, "on a scale
not witnessed since the days of colonialism." Further,
the current debate about arms inspections and alleged
links to al-Qaeda is revealed as pure political
theater, since the decision to invade Iraq was made
months ago.
<p>But seizure of Iraq's multi-trillion-dollar petroleum
reserves is only the immediate goal, the report shows.
RUPE's rigorous analysis of publicly available sources
-- including official documents, think-tank papers,
and press reports -- reveals that the US intends to
use the invasion of Iraq as a launching pad for a
drastic reshaping of the Middle East, to be followed
by an unprecedented expansion of US power worldwide.
The strategic trend of US foreign policy now points unmistakably towards global empire.
<p>To be sure, an imperial project on so ambitious a
scale entails big downside risks for the US, including staggering costs, military hazards, and the disruption of global "stability" (i.e., the dearly-bought loyalty of US allies and client states.) But the American Establishment seems prepared to go for broke, and its enthusiastic consensus behind a naked war of conquest cannot be explained solely by the "cowboy mentality" that some detect in the White House.
<p>What's really at stake -- and this will come as no
surprise to leftists -- is US control of global
markets. The report reveals that the US economy is now
facing a nightmare scenario: A crisis of
overproduction has crippled US GDP, resulting in
monstrous trade and budget deficits, even as a
potentially disastrous deflationary spiral appears to
be under way worldwide.
<p>Meanwhile, superpower rivals Europe, Russia and China
are mounting a vigorous challenge to US economic
preeminence, which is further threatened by the euro's emergence as a credible alternative to the dollar as global reserve currency. (All this is exhaustively detailed in the RUPE report, which draws its most telling evidence from the mainstream financial press.)
<p>In this context, the US sees confiscation of the
world's richest oil-producing regions as a magic
bullet. While securing its own access to petroleum
supplies for the foreseeable future, it can
simultaneously defend dollar hegemony and restructure
Middle East markets for the exclusive benefit of
US-based corporations.
<p>Which brings us to the crux: Direct American control
of oil would render any potential challengers for
world or regional supremacy perpetually dependent on
US forbearance. In RUPE's words, "once it has seized
the oil wells of west Asia the US will determine not
only which firms would bag the deals, not only the
currency in which oil trade would be denominated, not 
only the price of oil on the international market, but
even the destination of the oil." 
<p>RUPE’s argument here is powerful but complex, and this
summary is necessarily an extreme oversimplification.
But the overall thrust is quite clear: The US invasion
of Iraq needs to be understood not as an end in itself
but as the means to an end -- the foundation of a New
American Empire. 
<p>Needless to say, you won’t catch Tony Blair owning up
to the war’s real purpose as he flogs it to a
skeptical public. But the truth, or something pretty
close to it, is now readily available to anyone who
cares to look.  
<p><i>Jacob Levich (<a href="mailto:jlevich@earthlink.net">jlevich@earthlink.net</a>), a writer and
editor based in Queens, N.Y., assisted RUPE in
researching Behind The Invasion of Iraq -- which is a
fancy way of saying he forwarded several hundred
articles to an email address in Mumbai.
