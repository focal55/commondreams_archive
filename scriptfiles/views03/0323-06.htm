<p>The Bush administration might have done better to keep that list of war-supporting nations to itself. Rather than showing hearty cheers around the world for the U.S. war on Iraq, the list is embarrassingly thin gruel. 



<P>(And the claim of 15 more enthusiasts who want to remain anonymous only adds to the embarrassment. "Secret admirers" are the stuff of middle-school twitters.) 



<P>The plain fact of the matter is that the United States has gone into this war &#151; against an open tyrant and notorious international scofflaw, at that &#151; with fewer allies than it ordinarily could muster for an even more dubious cause. If our president is the cowboy many Europeans see him as being, he is a sheriff riding without a posse. 



<P>Only Britain is throwing in with us substantially, and there Prime Minister Tony Blair is doing so at manifest odds with British public opinion. Australia, also contrary to public opinion, and Poland are sending token troops. Spain and Japan are active political supporters. 



<P>That's about it. 



<P>Most of the other 30 are supporters only on an if-you-ask basis. And to be frank about it, most of them don't matter, one way or the other. Who feels much bucked up that we are at war with the concurrence &#151; and that often quiet if not outright sullen &#151; of Eritrea, Latvia, El Salvador, Iceland, Romania and the like? 



<P>What is especially galling about this foreign-policy flop is that President Bush has been right from the get-go in his aims &#151; to hold both Iraq and the United Nations to the disarmament deal they cut 12 years ago. 



<P>Rather than preparing the way for that, the president launched the issue abruptly, demanded its endorsement instead of working earnestly for agreement and arbitrarily set deadlines before much of the world was ready to buy into them. 



<P>And all that after two years of telling the world to buzz off. Chesty and full of itself, the Bush administration trashed international environmental concerns, especially about global warming, backed out of the developing International Criminal Court, undercut international family planning and unilaterally canceled treaties. Unlike previous administrations, it shrugged off the worsening Israeli-Palestinian violence, the major Middle East irritant. 



<P>Crucially, President Bush threw over U.S. policy since World War II to assert a unique right to intervene pre-emptively wherever the United States wishes, however it wants, to stop the emergence of military power that might one day bother it. Not unreasonably, much of the world fears that supporting us now against Iraq would amount to rubber-stamping that license. 



<P>Pew Research Center polls show that in the last year, the number of Germans who think favorably of the United States has fallen from 61 to 25 percent, of Italians from 70 to 34 percent, of the French from 63 percent to 31. Only 39 percent of Britons and 13 percent of the Spanish favor military action, 



<P>The United States enjoyed the world's sympathy and good offices after 9/11 and right through the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. 



<P>A quick war now, with relatively few casualties, proof Saddam Hussein was up to no good and welcoming Iraqis would redeem at least part of that loss. 



<P>We have to hope for that, mainly for humanitarian reasons but also because our president has bet the mortgage money on this one.
