<p>AT FIRST, you'd think it was a parody of the Pentagon, performed by the San Francisco Mime Troupe. 

<p>But you'd be wrong. The crackpot idea of creating an online futures market in which anonymous traders wager whether or not missile strikes, assassinations, coups or terrorist attacks take place was devised by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA. The Pentagon, moreover, defended the trading in futures -- called Policy Analysis Market-- as a way to gain intelligence about potential terrorists' plans; its Web site was prepared to register traders this Friday and begin trading on Oct. 1. 

<p>DARPA, as you may remember, is the same Pentagon unit that brought us the Orwellian Total Information Awareness Program, which, also in the name of fighting terrorism, planned to gather medical, financial and other computer- based information on all Americans. When senators balked, the Pentagon changed the name to the Terrorism Information Awareness Program. Whether the new name actually halted the surveillance of ordinary citizens is subject to debate. 

<p>Now, several senators have once again stopped DARPA. On Tuesday, the Pentagon abandoned its bizarre futures market after outraged senators denounced a program that would have allowed traders (including terrorists) to profit from accurately forecasting acts of terrorism and assassinations, particularly in the Middle East. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota condemned the program as "an incentive actually to commit acts of terrorism" and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., described the plan as "a futures market in death." 


<p>That the Pentagon would even think of using a business tool to predict terrorism boggles the mind. But it also raises important questions. Has our intelligence community performed so poorly that the Pentagon needs to analyze wagers on whether war will break out, missiles will be launched or leaders will be assassinated? 

<p>And is this what the Bush administration means when it says it wants to run the government like a business? Efficiency and accountability are great; but gambling on terrorism trivializes the murder of innocent civilians. 

<p>And just who should be held responsible for this off-the-wall scheme? Did Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approve of the Policy Market Analysis program? Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said he first learned of the program after reading about it in a newspaper. Excuse me, but as Rumsfeld's deputy, shouldn't Wolfowitz know what's going on in DARPA? And if he didn't know, then why not? 

<p>And let's not forget the man who would have headed this online futures market -- the infamous retired Adm. John M. Poindexter, who achieved notoriety as a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal. The senior national security adviser to former President Ronald Reagan, Poindexter was convicted of lying to Congress about selling weapons to Iran in order to provide illegal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Later, his conviction was reversed because he had received immunity for his testimony. 

<p>It seems to me it's time for Poindexter to really retire and leave government service -- right now. Aside from his criminal past, he's also headed two dangerous and undemocratic programs: The Total Information Awareness Program and now, the Policy Analysis Market. 

<p>But it is Rumsfeld who is ultimately responsible for the Pentagon. So perhaps it is time for Congress to take a closer look at some of the projects launched on his watch. During the planning of the war in Iraq, for example, Rumsfeld created his own intelligence unit, called the Office of Special Plans. 

<p>Were he and this inner circle responsible for any of the exaggerated prewar intelligence that documented the existence of WMDs? Was he trying to run the military like a business when he insisted on sending the smallest possible number of troops to Iraq? 

<p>So many questions. Isn't it time for some answers?
