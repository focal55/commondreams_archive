<p>As we approach the anniversary of the JFK assassination, we'll be treated to 
all kinds of warmed-over conspiracy debates. Was Lee Harvey Oswald a lone gunman 
or was he a pasty as he claimed before Jack Ruby killed him? <p>Those who believe 
in conspiracy theories may be paranoid, but there's something healthy about being 
skeptical when the government says, "Trust us." After all, conspiracies happen. 
<p>Whether the JFK assassination was a conspiratorial plot or not isn't very interesting 
to me. I'd much rather see a Warren Commission-type investigation into whether 
there's a much more far-reaching conspiracy. <p>Exhibit A: Robin Hahnel, professor 
of economics at American University and author of "Panic Rules! Everything You 
Need to Know About the Global Economy," offers this assessment: "The (Bush) administration's 
response to the WTO's ruling - that the tariffs imposed on steel imports in March 
2002 are a violation of WTO rules - is further proof that while the U.S. government 
preaches free trade for others, the U.S. has no intention of practicing it ourselves 
when we find it inconvenient. <p>"Now, like Frankenstein's monster, the WTO has 
turned on the master who created it, the U.S. government. While some voices in 
the administration might threaten to leave the WTO, that will only be grandstanding 
for the unilateralist faction of the Republican Party. U.S. corporations benefit 
tremendously from the unfair and undemocratic procedures the WTO has imposed on 
other countries. Slaps on the wrist like this one are the relatively small cost 
of that terrific deal: the WTO prevents developing countries from being able to 
protect their economies, requires them to enforce international copyrights and 
patents that cost them a fortune, and bans them from treating large multinational 
corporations differently than they treat domestic ones. <p>"In short, the WTO 
gives multinational corporations free rein and makes it impossible for Third World 
governments to promote economic development." <p>Hahnel continues: "On the home 
front, the benefits of the steel tariffs accrue disproportionately to the steel 
companies who are busy demanding give-back contracts from their employees. Steel 
workers would be better served by adequately funded retraining and job creation 
programs where laid-off workers draw unemployment benefits until they are placed 
into equally well-paying, unionized jobs in their hometowns." <p>Exhibit B: Alan 
Sager and Deborah Socolar, co-directors of the Health Reform Program at Boston 
University's School of Public Health, recently released a report titled "New Medicare 
Rx Benefit Means Big Profits for Drug Makers." <p>The report finds that "an estimated 
61.1 percent of the Medicare dollars that will be spent to buy more prescriptions 
will remain in the hands of drug makers as added profits. This windfall means 
an estimated $139 billion in increased profits over eight years." <p>Meanwhile, 
Congress has not come up with a way to reduce drug costs or ensure that all Americans 
have access to adequate health care. <p>Exhibit C: Doug Henwood, author of the 
new book, "After the New Economy," reports: "We learned last week that the U.S. 
economy grew at a 7.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter - even though we 
lost 41,000 jobs. Will these divergent trends continue? While pundits are busy 
celebrating the productivity boom, what it means in human terms is that the growth 
numbers have little connection with human welfare. Unlike earlier recessions, 
when laid-off workers were recalled when the cycle turned, this time the job losses 
look permanent and the new hires slow in coming. Employers are content to work 
existing staff harder and outsource the rest." (See www.jobwatch.org.) <p>This 
is far from conclusive evidence of a conspiracy but you can bet that what connects 
these dots is not mere chance or coincidence. After all, who benefits from all 
this? <p>I can tell you who isn't reaping the benefits. According to the U.N. 
Population Fund's 2003 report, half of the world's population is under the age 
of 25 and among those young people an estimated 238 million live in "extreme poverty." 
<p>Oswald may have been a lone gunman, but conspiracies happen. <p><I>Sean Gonsalves
