<p>In my eight years as a volunteer firefighter in rural California, some of the blazes I battled grew too fast to contain, out-racing our hoses at the whim of wind and topography. It was only luck that kept them from attaining the magnitude of the ones that ravaged the state last week.

<p>When you confront a fierce fire, the surge of adrenaline can provoke panic more dangerous than the flames themselves. As firefighters, we train to keep calm in these situations, and accurately assess what we can control with the resources at hand.

<p>Unfortunately, politicians have no such preparation, and time after time, the common good is trampled in the ensuing frenzy.

<p>Recent weeks have brought news of two conflagrations -- the flames that raced across southern California, and the wildfire of resistance to the U.S. occupation of Iraq. In both cases, Congress pushed through ill-conceived measures that offer illusory control over the problem.

<p>Last Thursday, by the heat of the California fires, the US Senate passed a jury-rigged fire-prevention bill. Under the guise of forestalling future tragedies, the Senate voted to spend three-quarters of a billion dollars on fire-proofing the forest.

<p>Half of the money will subsidize the logging of the people's forests at little gain to public safety. Logging would be stepped up on condition that the loggers also thin out some of the less valuable trees. If you guessed money was involved, you're right. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who brokered this plan, has rocketed to the top of the forest industry's contribution list. Timber's gifts to his 2004 campaign now exceed those to any other congressional candidate, according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.

<p>The other half of the money may do some good, by thinning the forest near towns and subdivisions. Through much of the West, generations of Smokey-the-Bear scare tactics and fire suppression allowed fuel to accumulate that now makes the inevitable fires more dangerous than before. Clearing the brush from these forests is an act of good neighborliness. Unfortunately, senators defeated amendments that would have focused the majority of funding on these areas.

<p>In either case, our zeal to thin the forest may outstrip our understanding of the best way to do so. Common wisdom in the last century held that old-growth forests were biological deserts, that clearcuts reduced fire danger, that hardwoods such as alder were useless impediments to the growth of more marketable timber. All of these myths have since been dispelled. We may yet learn that the mid-sized trees being auctioned for logging would help fire-proof the forest.

<p>Not that it would matter to Congress. Last week's vote was catalyzed by fear of a natural phenomenon that we can't control, and by an urge to impose our designs on a landscape whether we comprehend it or not.

<p>In this, the forest vote was far from unique. This week, Congress voted $87 billion toward the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq, a country that is even further beyond our control than the fires whipped by dry eastern breezes.

<p>Just as the forest has its hidden mysteries, Iraq is a land where our soldiers have a hard time telling friend from foe, and where US troops struggle with a chronic shortage of reliable translators.

<p>The forces arrayed against them are as implacable as Santa Ana winds. They include the antipathy any nation would feel toward an occupying army, and the rise of militant Islam with its hostility toward America. Some of the resistance is the product of past US actions in the Middle East, which have allowed the fuel of discontent to accumulate.

<p>Much as the Senate bill will enrich Big Timber, Congress's Iraq appropriation will funnel money to Halliburton, Bechtel, and other firms with their snouts in the eleven-figure trough of reconstruction funding. Among them, the 70 companies with federal contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan gave half a million dollars to the 2000 Bush campaign, according to a study by the Center for Public Integrity. These well-connected firms have turned public ignorance to their financial advantage.

<p>When I learned to fight fire, our instructors insisted that we make an honest assessment of our forces and the challenges we faced. Some fires you could attack directly with water and hand tools, while others spread so fast you fall back and try to confine them from afar. We were taught always to identify an escape route and to be mindful of the possibility that a shift in wind or humidity could turn the fire full upon us.

<p>As a firefighter, I counted on my commanders to deploy me with those cautions in mind, and I am here to write this because they did. Looking at the way our troops are being used in Iraq, I doubt their higher-ups are treating them with as much consideration.
