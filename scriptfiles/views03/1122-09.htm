<p>One person, one vote? In the last presidential election, half a million more Americans picked Gore over Bush. But the one vote that really counted was the deciding Supreme Court Justice's for Bush over Gore.

<p>4 to 6 million is the number of voters whose votes for President were not counted in the 2000 election.

<p>57,700 is the number of Florida voters who were purged from voter rolls for being former felons.

<p>8,000 of these Florida "felons" - nearly 14 times Bush's official margin of victory - were wrongly turned away. These purged voters were disproportionately Democrats of African-American and Hispanic descent.

<p>346 is the number of days until the 2004 election.

<p>Whether it's Kerry riding a Harley or Dean whistling Dixie, the spotlight's been on the latest exploits of the Democratic presidential hopefuls. However, the most important players in the 2004 Election are grassroots organizers and voting rights litigators who are battling Republican re-districting, disenfranchisement laws and public apathy. The question is how will the rules of the voting game change?

<p>While politicos and pundits are rabidly anticipating the primaries, close to five hundred organizers, activists, students and elected officials are quietly converging on Washington DC on November 21 to "Claim Democracy." Topics of the fifty workshops range from how corporate power influences elections to what the implications of the Help America Vote Act are. But one theme remains the same: there will not be a rerun of the 2000 election debacle.

<p>While the presidential rat pack is speculating on how to match Bush's fundraising potential, cash is flowing into voting rights campaigns. The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Rockefeller Foundation are a just a couple of foundations who are rumored to have granted or plan to grant millions of dollars for upcoming voting projects.

<p>NAACP, State PIRGS, and People for the American are only a few of big name nonprofits with voter projects. ACORN, a community organization of low- and moderate-income families, is partnering with Justice Corps and Floridians for All to gather signatures in Florida for a minimum wage ballot initiative, while registering voters at the same time. According to Justice Corps' promo, "The minimum wage initiative will increase voter turnout among low- income workers who have seen few benefits from the Bush tax cuts."

<p>Meanwhile the ACLU is working to re-enfranchise ex-felons who have been denied the right to vote. And after a success in Washington State, the Brennan Center for Justice is challenging state laws in New York and Florida that disenfranchise felons in the first place. Nationally, thirty-five percent of all disenfranchised voters are African American men.

<p>The Brennan Center is also litigating against political redistricting of Pennsylvania which virtually guarantees a majority of Congressional seats to Republicans for the rest of the decade, regardless of whether- they win a majority of votes.

<p>And new organizations are joining the fray at a rousing rate, revealing innovative techniques and growing momentum. Spurred on by the successes of Moveon.Org and Meetup.com, the League of Independent Voters has created a web portal (<a href="http://www.indyvoter.org" target="_new">indyvoter.org</a>) to publish local online/offline progressive voter guides all over the country and create a national network of locally-driven, multi- issue, multi-constituency Progressive Voting Blocs. Their question to the public: "Do you want to swing this election?"

<p>And at Columbia Law School, a new organization, IMPACT, is creating a national network of law students to educate, activate and protect voters. They are teaming up with the Brennan Center to create easy-to-understand voting guides and poll monitoring guides. IMPACT will also channel law students into existing get- out-the-vote campaigns, ex-felon re-enfranchisement projects, and poll watching efforts.

<p>So what does all of this mean for 2004 and the elections to come? Well if these pro-democracy forces are effective, they could change the rules of the voting game, incorporating millions of voters who previously have been discouraged, disenfranchised or driven away. And more immediately, they could mean "Game Over" for President Bush.
