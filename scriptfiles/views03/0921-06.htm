<p>As the winds of the Iraq war blow against the sitting U.S. president, a four-star general flips his service cap into the ring.
<p> This general, we're told, is staunchly against the war. This apparent oxymoron, Gen. Wesley Clark, is no longer a general. It's amazing what clarity a tie and a civilian suit can bring to generals. After World War II, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower lost his taste for battle, got himself elected president, than warned the nation against the "military-industrial complex." Prior to his West Point days, Eisenhower, it turns out, had been terminally influenced by his pacifist mother.
<p> Clark, it appears, came gung ho out of the womb. After West Point, he led a mechanized infantry unit in Vietnam, got a serious Purple Heart injury and struggled successfully away his terminal limp in rehabilitation. Earning his first star at age 43, he went on to command NATO forces' hammering of Kosovo.
<p> Kosovo was not quite a war just as Iraq is not quite at peace. Still, Clark was forced to retire and rethink his commitment to battlefield shock and awe.
<p> With eight draft-evading candidates and one indecisive war hero, the Humvee of the Democratic Party hasn't yet gained traction against the Iraq war that Bush tricked the country into, along with the candidates who serve in Congress. U.S. soldiers continue to die daily in Iraq, yet the complicit Democrats can't capitalize on this growing disaster they authorized. In walks Clark, whose handlers would have us believe that his clean hands are against the Iraq war.
<p> The general is telegenic in a Teutonic sort of way. Lean, trim, with an easy smile, he is also said to be raw-nerved, ambitious and intelligent. To support his last claim, one childhood friend recalls that he never got less than an "A" on his report card. Many a straight-A reputation has fallen down upon examination, but this one stands pending examination.
<p> His West Point record, however, is not in dispute. Of the 579 cadets in his 1966 class, Clark graduated No. 1. Off the battlefield, few generals who led their West Point class have made much of a name for themselves in political life. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who led his 1903 class of 93, comes to mind but only as a World War II hero and a self-absorbed potential presidential disaster. George Patton was 46th of 103 cadets in his 1909 class; William Westmoreland, the American commander in Vietnam, was 112th of 276; and not surprisingly, Alexander Haig graduated near the bottom of his 1947 class, at 214th of 310. The one general to make it to the White House last century was Eisenhower, who, in his 1915 West Point class, ranked 61st out of 164.
<p> As a former Army officer, let me state that academic brilliance is as valid, or invalid, a measurement of intelligence in the military as it is in civilian life. However, Clark's West Point ranking suggests not only an egghead but a bookworm soul committed to the art of war.
<p> This self-same warrior would have us believe - conveniently - that he is opposed to the Iraq War.
<p> Fortunately Wesley Clark has a written record and that record, as with so much of his broadcast interviews, is murky on the Iraq issue. In a series of columns for the Times of London, Clark raised personal concerns about the wisdom of attacking with insufficient forces. Initially, he also advised that the United States should exhaust all means to go in with international support.
<p> Clark lost all cautions, however, after the United States and Britain stormed into Iraq under the deception that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, weapons that the former NATO commander was convinced Hussein owned.
<p> Under the April 10 Times' headline, "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0917-14.htm">What Must Be Done to Complete a Great Victory</a>," Clark enthused, "Liberation is at hand. Liberation - the powerful balm that justifies painful sacrifice ... is in the air. Yet a bit more work and some careful reckoning need to be done before we take our triumph."
<p> Triumph, indeed, is the note Clark sounded throughout the column. At one point, he praised Bush and Blair for their steely resolve in essentially going it alone. His visions in the column suggested ecstasy and celebration, not the doubt and opposition his handlers are now generating. 
<p> "Let's have those parades on the Mall and down Constitution Avenue - but don't demobilize yet," Clark wrote. "There's a lot yet to be done, and not only by the diplomats."
<p> Clark reportedly has never finished second at anything. He is not likely to finish second among the 10 Democrats. He is also not likely to finish first. 
<p> The question on the general's Iraq policy is, How can he possibly get an "A"?
