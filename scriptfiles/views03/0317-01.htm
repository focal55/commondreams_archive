<p>WASHINGTON -- It was a weekend of going through the motions. Lip service was still being given to the idea that the war could be stopped. "It's Not Too Late," read one of the signs displayed on Saturday as tens of thousands of antiwar protesters marched from the Washington Monument to the White House.</p>
<P> Dick Cheney was on television yesterday morning advancing the fiction that "we're still in the final stages of diplomacy." President Bush was meeting in the Azores with his coalition of the hard-of-hearing, the small but stubborn group of men committed to attacking Iraq no matter how wrong or undesirable that might be, or how much outrage it provokes around the world.</p><!-- Middle ad not targeted --><P> We're about to watch the tragedy unfold. The president, who's wanted war with Iraq all along, has been unwilling to listen seriously to anyone with an opposing view. He's turned his back on those worried about the consequences of a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance that has served the world well for better than half a century. He's closed his mind to those who have argued that pre-emptive warfare will ultimately make the world more — not less — unstable.</p><P> Mr. Bush has remained unmoved by the millions of protesters against the war who have demonstrated in the United States and around the world. If any one of those millions has had something worthwhile to say, the president hasn't acknowledged it.</p><P> Risks? In the president's view this is a war of liberation that, in addition to removing Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction, will bring democracy to the people of Iraq and lead to a miraculous flowering of democracy throughout the Mideast.</p><P> Never mind the secret State Department document (disclosed last week in The Los Angeles Times) that holds just the opposite view — that not only are the prospects for democracy in the region poor, but entrenched economic and social problems are likely to undermine even basic stability for years to come.</p><P> President Bush may not see them, but the risks are enormous.</p><P> "This is an invasion and a long-term occupation of an Arab country in the midst of the most volatile region of the world," said former Representative Tom Andrews of Maine, who has led a particularly well-organized and thoughtful protest group called Win Without War.</p><P> The <org idsrc="NYSE" value="NYT">New York Times</org> had a front-page story yesterday about warnings from intelligence officials that a U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq would embolden Islamic terrorist organizations around the world, strengthening their recruitment efforts and increasing the likelihood of another strike in the U.S.</p><P> The president's unwillingness to listen to other voices has extended even to the religious community in the U.S. "With the exception of the Southern Baptist Convention, almost every major church in this country has expressed huge reservations about going to war with Iraq," said the Rev. Clifton Kirkpatrick, the chief ecclesiastical officer of the Presbyterian Church.</p><P> Mr. Kirkpatrick was part of a delegation of religious leaders who met in London in February with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. The group has developed a proposal that it calls a "possible alternative to war." The proposal calls, among other things, for the indictment of Saddam Hussein as a war criminal by an international tribunal; the use of the current military buildup to support and enforce a "greatly intensified" regime of weapons inspections; the development of a U.N. plan for the temporary administration of a post-Saddam Iraq; and the creation of a huge international humanitarian effort to address the continued suffering of the Iraqi people.</p><P> "We don't claim to be public policy experts, but these are at least contributions that need to be explored much more deeply," said Mr. Kirkpatrick.</p><P> By the end of last week that hope was gone. The Rev. Jim Wallis, editor of the evangelical journal Sojourners, headed the delegation that met with Mr. Blair and had been trying to arrange a meeting with Mr. Bush. On Thursday he told me, "I got a call back from the White House saying the president is not scheduling any more meetings."</p><P> The president's mind was made up long ago and all the chatter pro and con was just so much smoke in the wind. Mr. Bush will have his war.</p><P> Last night was a time of sadness around the world as people who think that war should always be a last resort lit candles to express their sorrow, their frustration and, however unrealistically, their last faint flickerings of hope.</p>
