<p>WASHINGTON -- Well, there goes the Jewish women's vote.</p>
<P>
Twin revelations of Arnold Schwarzenegger's groping and goose-stepping are not going to play well with some Californians.     The androgynous Gray spent the weekend hissing at Arnold's excess testosterone, as Arnold tried a rope-a-grope strategy.</p>
<P>
The governor had to be singing "Danke Schön" over tales of the Austrian's 70's foolery:  playing Nazi marching songs; clicking his heels and pretending to be an SS officer; clowning as Hitler with  comb as  mustache; and praising the dictator's ambition and oratorical skills. A Davis aide slyly wondered if Mel Brooks was Arnold's campaign manager.</p>
<P>
When I was in California, Democrats said that as soon as Mr. Schwarzenegger went up in the polls, the Davis camp was prepared to blast him on women and "play it out in all its seamy glory," as one well-connected Hollywood Democrat said.</p>
<P>
When the star's female accusers were recycled in the L.A. Times, Democratic women's groups — already in full cry against Arnold for being boorish despite his un-Bushian moderate stances on women's issues — howled even louder. They rejected his apology and explanation that he was just being "playful" when he grabbed several left breasts out of left field over the decades. </p>
<P>
Even before the latest charges,  Hillary Clinton, by phone, and Ann Richards and the lawyer Gloria Allred, in person, joined Governor Davis at a bristly rally in West Hollywood with 200 female activists, including contingents from NOW and Planned Parenthood, chanting about Arnold's sins.</p>
<P>
At the Davis rally, Senator Clinton chose not to defend the groper who was not her husband. Ms. Richards chose not to defend the groper who was not a Democrat; in 1998, the former Texas governor shrugged off Mr. Clinton's louche behavior: "If we try to retire every man from office who's done what he did, we wouldn't need affirmative action."</p>
<P>
Now Republicans who thundered against Bill — not Arnold, who scorned impeachment as a waste of time and money —  argue that peccadilloes are not relevant to governing. And feminists who backed Bill are ushering Arnold gropees up to the Democratic microphones.</p>
<P>
Cheekbones jutting, Maria Shriver played the Tammy Wynette-Hillary role with nerve and verve, reassuring Republican women in Newport Beach: "You can listen to the people who have never met Arnold, or who met him for five seconds 30 years ago. Or you can listen to me."</p>
<P>
Certainly, the bodybuilder-turned-phenom has had moments of being, to use David Letterman's word, a lunkhead. But I find the selective outrage of feminists just as offensive.</p>
<P>
Feminism died in 1998 when Hillary allowed henchlings and Democrats to demonize Monica as an unbalanced stalker, and when Gloria Steinem defended Mr. Clinton against Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones by saying he had merely made clumsy passes, then accepted rejection, so there was no sexual harassment involved. As to his dallying with an emotionally immature 21-year-old, Ms. Steinem noted, "Welcome sexual behavior is about as relevant to sexual harassment as borrowing a car is to stealing one."</p>
<P>
Surely what's good for the Comeback Kid is good for the Terminator.</p>
<P>
It was no surprise on Friday that Mr. S was backing off his promise to release those "Springtime for Hitler" outtakes from George Butler's 1977 documentary <object.title class="Movie" idsrc="nyt_ttl" value="39659"><alt-code idsrc="nyt_ttl" value="Pumping Iron"/>"Pumping Iron."</object.title> No dummy, he knew years ago his "Nazi stuff" could be trouble. He bought up the incriminating evidence, 100 hours of histrionic  interviews, for a mil, and worked with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, giving it a mil in guilt gilt.</p>
<P>
I asked my friend Leon Wieseltier, who knows a lot about Judaism and politics and women, about Arnold.</p>
<P>
"Schwarzenegger is obviously not anti-Semitic or an admirer of genocide," he said. "Hitler does not appear to have been his moral ideal, but his business model. His old fondness for the Führer is just another expression of the animating principle of his life and movies: the worship and steady acquisition of power. Sacramento is simply the biggest Hummer he can buy."</p>
<P>
Or, if Maria is right, Arnold will be a "smart, innovative, disciplined, determined  . . . can-do" leader, trying to give something back to the state where he arrived penniless. </p>
<P>
Besides, if we ever hear the "Horst Wessel Song" drifting from Governor Schwarzenegger's office in Sacramento, there's always the blitzkrieg option: the recall of the recall.    </i>
