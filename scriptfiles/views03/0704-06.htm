<p>Among the brightly colored bits of plastic at the bottom of a toy box I recently came across a little plastic doll. It was a miniature Barbie that had come free from McDonald's and in tiny writing on the back it said "Made In Vietnam". It left me wondering who'd actually won the Vietnam war. One generation endured the heaviest bombardment in history and succeeded in driving out the world's most powerful army in order that their children could be free to sit in a sweatshop making little Aryan Barbie dolls to be given out free with a Happy Meal. 

<p>Today is Independence Day in the United States, when Americans celebrate freedom from Britain. The final straw had been the enforcement of the Penal Acts, which had been passed so that 200 years later teenage boys would giggle in history lessons. If today's British government had found itself at war with the Americans it would have been very confused. "Er, right, but can we still be on the same side as you anyway?" Re-reading the Declaration of Independence makes you realize what far-sighted men those first American politicians were: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Oh, and the right to put American bases in over a hundred independent countries, organize fascist coups to install pro-American puppet regimes, stifle free trade if it's not in US economic interests and force children everywhere to watch a schmaltzy purple dinosaur called Barney." 



<p>But American imperialism is a lot more complex and subtle than the version its people threw off a couple of centuries ago. For example, they have ruthlessly taken over our cinemas with the calculated and cynical trick known as "making better films than we do". And the British computer industry could never really compete with Microsoft; tragically, that abacus factory has closed now. Sharing a language means our culture is even more open to colonization. My laptop tells me "Your battery is running low" in an electronic Seattle accent. If French and German PCs talk in their own tongue, we should insist on no less. Computers sold in London should be programmed to talk like Cockneys: "Do wot mate, yer bleedin' batteries running Barley Mow, innit?" Dublin computers should say: "I'd say the old battery's running out there, but I shouldn't worry about it." And on the Isle of Wight, well, it's not an issue because they haven't got computers yet. 



<p>The US fashion industry spotted a gap in the market and put a Gap in every high street; Nike have got a big tick against every country in the world; and if you have a coffee machine in your home, then expect Starbucks to open a branch in your kitchen any day now. Indeed, with coffee being the second most important trading commodity after oil, how long until anti-war protesters are chanting: "No Blood For Cappuccinos"? 



<p>American interests are advanced by Nato, the IMF, the WTO, the World Bank and dozens of multinationals whose turnover is greater than the GDP of most countries. Indeed it won't be long before an American company organizes the first leveraged buyout of a sovereign state. "Ladies and gentleman of the board, following a successful takeover bid, this company will now be known as Glaxo-Smith-Kline-Belgium. It gives us a seat on the European Union, a small army and an almost unlimited supply of yummy chocolates." 



<p>There is a certain irony that today the American empire is celebrating an essentially anti-imperialist event. But, outside it, July 4 is becoming the focus for a new campaign - a declaration of independence from America. Today at US bases in Britain, such as USAF Fairford in Gloucestershire or at Menwith Hill in Yorkshire, parties will celebrate the idea that maybe one day we could live in a country that does not automatically assist in the star wars program, does not send British troops in support of US foreign policy and where we are not forced to call Marathon bars "Snickers". 



<p>But being against US government policy should not be lazily extended to general anti-Americanism. If you're a US citizen please do not think I bear you any personal ill will (unless you yourself happen to be reading this, George W - which, let's face it, is unlikely, given the absence of pictures). So Happy Independence Day, America; you did a fantastic job throwing off the hereditary monarchy of George III. But now would it be okay if we declared independence from the hereditary presidency of George II?
