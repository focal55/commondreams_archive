<p>"The Platform is the Party's contract with the people."  This noble 
sentiment has been used by both Republicans and Democrats in 
characterizing their state and national party Platforms over the 
decades.  It can become an embarrassing yardstick for any Party that 
lives a double life.
<p>Consider President Bush and his Texas State Republican Platform of 
2002 which is still in effect.  The authors and endorsers of this 
lengthy document were taking no chances.  It says crisply that each 
"Republican candidate for a public or Party office shall be provided a 
current copy of the Party platform at the time of filing.  The candidate 
shall be asked to read and initial each page of the platform and sign a 
statement affirming he/she has read the entire platform."
<p>Signing on the dotted line is connected with the Party giving the 
candidate financial and other support.
<p>Then follows policy after policy of great specificity in direct 
opposition to what the Bush Administration is doing and not doing.  For 
example, the Texas Republican Party demands that Washington repeal NAFTA 
and GATT and get out of the World Trade Organization and the United 
Nations.  It is adamant against any gathering, accumulation and 
dissemination of personal data and information on law-abiding citizens 
by business and governments.  It wants "all citizens" to be free from 
government surveillance of their electronic communications.
<p>In a slam against Attorney General John Ascroft, the Texas Party 
believes that "the current greatest threat to our individual liberties 
is overreaching government controls established under the guise of 
preventing terrorism."
<p>Remember, this is the Texas state Republican Party.  It is President 
Bush's Party -- the organization that launched his political career to 
the Governorship and beyond.  His friends and political allies run this 
Party.    
<p>So it is remarkable to read that the Platform demands the 
"elimination of presidential authority to issue executive orders, 
presidential decision directives. . . .and a repeal of all previous 
executive orders and administrative mandates."  This policy would 
handcuff both George W. Bush and John Ascroft.    
<p>In opposition to President Bush, his state Party insists that social 
security funds "should not be commingled or spent with general revenues 
or invested in private or public corporate stock."  And it adds, Social 
Security benefits should "be non-taxable," until private pensions 
replace social security.
<p>Talk about abolishing government!  The Texas Republican Party wants 
to terminate the U.S. Department of Education, (there goes Bush's Leave 
No Child Behind hoax), the Internal Revenue Service, along with the 
elimination of the personal income tax, inheritance tax, corporate 
income tax, payroll tax and the minimum wage.  That is not all.  The 
Party wants to close down the Department of Health and Human Services, 
Commerce, Labor, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and for good measure, the "position of 
Surgeon General."
<p>The Platform has one demand that is quite sensible -- namely "The 
Party does not support governmental subsidies, tariffs, bailouts, or 
other forms of corporate welfare [including sports stadiums] that are 
used to protect and preserve businesses or industries that have failed 
to remain relevant, competitive, and efficient over time."
<p>President Bush made his fortune by getting Texas taxpayers  to pay 
for the Texas Rangers's new baseball stadium.  His government now 
expandscorporate welfare on the backs of individual taxpayers, while 
allowing huge tax escapes for large multinational corporations.
<p>If you want to read more, long onto 
      <a href="http://www.texasgop.org/library/RPTPlatform2002.pdf" target="_new">www.texasgop.org/library/RPTPlatform2002.pdf</a>.  But if you've read this 
far, you may be asking how did this astonishing Texas GOP vs. Bush come 
about.  It has to do with the double life of the Republican Party -- the 
main party dominated by corporatists and the adjunct Party relying on 
conservatives and libertarians to produce the margin of votes for 
victory in elections.
    <p>The corporatist Republicans give the platforms and the core 
ideological issues to the conservatives, pat them on the back at 
convention time and then move into office with the welcome mat for Big 
Business lobbyists and their slushfunds.
    <p>This duplicity is illustrated by the large contributions that the 
national Republican Party takes from the gambling industry in return for 
political support.  In contrast, the Texas Party Platform states that 
"gambling has had a devastating impact on many Texas families" and 
opposes "any further legalization, government facilitation, or financial 
guarantees relating to any type of gambling. . . "
    <p>In a letter to President Bush, I called on him to engage in 
truth-in-advertising and let the voters of this country know which 
provisions of his own state Party's Platform he endorses and which ones 
he opposes.  For all its faults, the media does not like forked tongues 
and will sooner or later demand "clarification."
    <p>As for the Democratic Party, why didn't it make hay with this 
Platform, as the Republicans surely would have if the shoe was on the 
other foot.  Why?  Because the Democratic Party IS hay.
