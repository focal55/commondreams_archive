<p>Nothing can slow it down and keep it off its course. The dumbing-down of America continues at a furious pace.

<p>Today, I offer as an example one Dale Petroskey. Petroskey isn't keeping politics out of baseball, as he claims. He's keeping the First Amendment out of it. That, and the art of having a clue.

<p>Petroskey, we have come to learn in the past few days – because no one cared before – is president of the Baseball Hall of Fame. And he has turned something simple and American into a cause célébre.

<p>There was to be a film festival at the Hall later this month to celebrate the 15th anniversary of "Bull Durham," one of the better baseball movies. But Petroskey has canceled it because of the anti-war views of two of its stars, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon.

<p>Petroskey sent Robbins a letter – and I paraphrase – basically stating that Robbins has every right as an American to voice his opinion, but his criticism of President Bush at this sensitive time is inappropriate and could undermine the U.S. position in Iraq and put our troops in jeopardy.

<p>Petroskey apparently doesn't know much about war, either.

<p>Robbins wrote him back, in part stating: "You belong with other cowards and ideologues in the hall of infamy and shame."

<p>Petroskey since has said he never thought he'd break open this can of worms, that he's simply trying to keep politics out of baseball and that the Hall is not the place to voice anti-war views. Robbins and Sarandon never said they were going to protest the war during the ceremony.

<p>In fact, they weren't supposed to speak. They were going to the Hall to honor the fine work of writer/director Ron Shelton. But, seizing the opportunity, Petroskey grabbed the mike to basically explain his own political views.

<p>No matter what you think of Robbins or Sarandon, they are Americans, which means they have every right to voice their opinions on a controversial subject. And it certainly has nothing to do with a film made 15 years ago that celebrated the game Petroskey lives to celebrate.

<p>You can bring the mountain to the molehill – if you don't think.

<p>Somewhere in Iraq right now, there's a looter with an office chair on his back shouting Tim Robbins' name? . . . Somebody should ask Petroskey about that great American racist, Ty Cobb, being in the Hall . . .
