<p>The exclusive club called the U.S. Senate has 100 members. This week 94 of 
them ducked and ran before a pre-arranged voice vote gave President Bush the $87.5 
billion war check he wanted. <p>The six senators who had the guts to stay around 
to voice a vote: <p>• Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. <p>• Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I. <p>• Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D. <p>• Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii <p>• Harry Reid, D-Nev. <p>• Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska <p>Among the six, Byrd shouted a loud "No!" The other five voted "Yes." 
<p>Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., is an admired acquaintance of mine. 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., is a longtime respected friend. But both 
were wrong in agreeing to the cowardly voice vote so senators didn't have to go 
on record on the controversial bill. <p>Republicans who favored it were afraid 
constituents might think the price is too high. Democrats against it feared being 
called unpatriotic. <p>By contrast, the House earlier put its members on record 
when it approved the bill 298 to 121. <p>In the "debate" before the Senate voice 
vote in an almost empty chamber, Stevens, the longest-serving Republican, carried 
the ball for Bush. "We will not walk away from Iraq," Stevens pledged. <p>Byrd, 
the longest-serving Democrat, argued: "This $87 billion ... provides the wherewithal 
for the United States to stay the course in Iraq when what we badly need is a 
course correction. The president owes the American people an exit strategy for 
Iraq, and it is time for him to deliver." <p>Polls show we're split about 50-50 
on Bush's handling of Iraq. But 100% of us should shame those 94 senators who 
were afraid to be counted on one of the most important and controversial bills 
to come before this Congress. <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; Copyright 2003 USA TODAY
