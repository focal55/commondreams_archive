<p>A report prepared for Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., catches the Bush administration red-handed distorting and suppressing politically awkward scientific findings and boosting ideology-driven panaceas that ignore overwhelming contrary research. This is political correctness of an extraordinarily reckless sort. 

<p>The report was prepared by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Government Reform. Forget its partisan origins. This is a picture that should disturb Republicans perhaps most of all. What is the future of a governing party that founds its policies on loopy pseudo-science? 

<p>The classic case: Soviet agriculture was undermined for years by Stalin's sponsorship of goofball biologist T.D. Lysenko, whose wrongheaded theories, especially in genetics, were embraced as serving Marxist orthodoxy. A whole generation of Russian biology was lost to his wild goose chases. 

<p>To promote drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Interior Secretary Gale Norton told Congress that most caribou calve outside the target area when her agency's own scientists reported just the opposite. 


<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture now requires its scientists to get special permission to speak out about "agricultural practices with negative health and environmental consequences." That's specifically so in matters of water contamination, hazardous materials and animal feeding and other operations that harm soil, water or air quality. 

<p>And, sure enough, research about industrial hog farms that might have sparked calls for regulation has been suppressed by the administration. 

<p>The National Cancer Institute was pressured to scrap a finding, supported by extensive research, that abortion does not cause breast cancer. At the behest of anti-abortion groups, a claim that the question is up in the air was substituted. 

<p>Information about serious environmental problems was edited out of a report on Yellowstone Park, and the Corps of Engineers reversed itself under political pressure and killed its proposed protections for wetlands, a change pushed by homebuilders. 

<p>Independent medical and scientific authorities have been removed from key federal advisory groups in favor of industry lobbyists, other interested parties and career contrarians — for instance, the advisory committee of the National Center for Environmental Health and the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. 

<p>The Department of Health and Human Services replaced scientists on a lead-poisoning panel with industry consultants and scrapped recent research. And HHS put a conservative religious activist against the abortion drug RU-486, with little else to recommend him, on a reproductive health panel. 

<p>Notoriously, there's global warming, still denied by the administration despite the overwhelming concurrence of international scientific opinion and even, oops, of a study panel appointed by the administration itself. 

<p>And the administration has forced the Centers for Disease Control to back away from broad-based sex education, which research has found to be effective, in favor of abstinence-only programs that research has not found to be effective. Sex education, under new Bush guidelines, is evaluated not by the resulting sexual practices of participants but by their subsequent sexual beliefs, and condoms are scorned, dismissed for disease prevention and contraception even though the data are compelling that they are useful for both. 

<p>There is more than one way for a president to lie about sex. This one is actually dangerous.
