<p>In early October of 2002 -- when the radio sputtered and whined with 
 accusations by the Bush Administration declaring a direct link between
the 
 terrorist activity of Al Qaeda and the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein;
I 
 was sitting beside my 11-year old daughter in a car. It continued,
with 
 charges that Hussein's Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in
 violation of U.N. resolutions.

<p> "It's a sunny afternoon in Northern California," the weatherman 
 interrupted, "puffy white clouds resting upon a beautiful blue sky."
We sat 
 in the car eating french fries in the parking lot of our local burger
 joint. President George W. Bush had just rebuffed the United Nations'
push 
 to re-introduce weapons inspection teams into an Iraq where even a
 deservedly humiliated Saddam Hussein had expressed willingness to
accept 
 them. Tightening in my gut, on this otherwise fab day, were troubling
 questions about our nation's understanding of this pending conflict.
Its 
 most accessible information sources were the corporately sponsored and

 largely conservative media outlets. Indeed, in my gut, were my own
 troubling questions, not only about our Administration's unilateral 
 military posturing, but also, what effect U.S. decisions today might
have 
 on my children's tomorrow.

<p> Since September 11, 2001, when Kilroy left his mark, I had been, of
 course,
 concerned for the physical safety of my children, and those of the
nation. 
 More urgently though, for the food of their spirit, their sense of
right 
 and wrong, and of their will to be individuals of character and true
 patriotism in a media environment largely exemplified by mistrust, 
 dishonesty, censorship and national policies fostering division,
death, and 
 arbitrary consumerism.

<p> Saint Augustine said that "Hope has two beautiful daughters: anger and 
 courage; anger at the way things are, and courage to change them."
Beside 
 me, my little girl tugged at the blue ribbon in her blond hair, her
eyes 
 forward, gentle but unblinking; her front teeth nipped at a french
fry, one 
 slow bite at a time. As I started the car, I wondered if her future
and my 
 son's would befriend or be vanquished by Saint Augustine's daughters
of 
 hope. And I had to ask myself, "What remaining hope did I have? What
 example was I to them?" I carried my troubling questions to the
President 
 of the United States, in a public letter printed October 18, 2002, in
the 
 Washington Post.

<p> I'm neither a peace activist nor a partisan politico and the letter I 
 printed did not represent the platform of any movement, or speak with 
 determination against any necessity. My letter spoke to questions of
an 
 American man and father, protected and encouraged by our Constitution,
and 
 obliged by my own individual sense of democracy and civic
responsibility. I 
 had been inspired to speak up by my love of my children, which
recalled my 
 admiration for our founding fathers, and the tradition of thousands of

 engaged men and women before me. In my own way, I sought to join all
of 
 them in waving the American flag.

<p> Following the printing of that letter, my public flag, I was hit by a
 tidal
 wave of media misrepresentation, and even accusations of treason. I 
 experienced firsthand the repressive condition of public debate in our

 country, as it prepared for war. I was beginning to feel the price to
be 
 paid by a citizen exercising a position of dissent.

<p> If my hope as an American was not dwindling, it was certainly under
 siege.
 Hope though, like truth, is a stubborn creature.

<p> In early December 2002, I was invited by Norman Solomon of the
 Institute
 for Public Accuracy to join him on his journalistic tour of Baghdad. I
met&nbsp;with Norman and did some due diligence on the IPA. Norman is a
softspoken 
 gentleman, and a relentless author of books, essays, and articles
exposing 
 media truth and fiction. He is a scholar of media truth bending and
 breaking, and his IPA is an American non-profit mobilizer dedicated to
that 
 journalistic mission. There was no question in my gut on this one. I
 accepted Norman's invitation and was going to Iraq.
<p> I acknowledged the concerns of my wife and children for my safety and
 they
 acknowledged my need to replace television images with a real sense of

 place and people (if only the kind one gets visiting anywhere for the
first 
 time). You search for a taste, a smell, a piece of truth, something to

 attach to the questions of conscience that gnaw at many of us.

<p> It was very clear that my trip, like my letter, would be
 misrepresented
 both in the United States and by the Iraqi press. But my view is
unchanged, 
 that as a weapon of propaganda, it would only be the most popular
American 
 media that could do myself and eventually our increasingly deployed
troops 
 any real harm. The United States had all the cards. We have the
greatest 
 military might on the planet. The Iraq I visited was the most
decimated, 
 starved, diseased and polluted place I had ever witnessed. Much of
this, 
 the result of sanctions imposed upon its people by a United States-led

 coalition, and exacerbated by the willful exploitation of them by
their own 
 leadership. Saddam Hussein's three-page hokey mailer of a newspaper,
 promoting my visit as support for his leadership, would be no match
for the 
 positions taken by our own global networks in willful false depiction
of my 
 intentions and statements. I made no comments in Baghdad against our
 government. Not one. I did, however, declare an acceptance of some
personal 
 accountability for my government's actions, those then, and now, paid
for 
 in part by my tax dollars.

<p> In short, we deserve the government we allow, and none more than those

 of
 us who have experienced economic and personal privilege. In Iraq, I
made no 
 expert assertions and came to no absolute conclusions. Prior to,
during, 
 and since visiting Iraq,I have consulted over 100 experts in our
Middle 
 Eastern affairs, military and civilian, with a primary focus on U.N.
 weapons inspection capabilities. These consultations measurably
increased 
 my doubt at the factuality or the wisdom of the Administration's
assertions 
 and proposed remedies. I spoke at length with wary war correspondents
whose 
 repeated attempts to bring deeper understanding to the American public
were 
 consistently thwarted by editorial staffs, networks, and superiors,
both 
 Iraqi and American.

<p> While in Baghdad, I visited a Pediatric hospital, schools, people on
 the
 streets, Iraqi officials, their Christian Deputy Prime Minister Aziz,
and 
 Minister of Health Mubarek. I met with humanitarian aides, U.N.
officials, 
 the local director of UNICEF (a Dutchman), and an 8-year-old Iraqi boy
who 
 had been maimed by a cruise missile in Basra while his older brother
 perished in the Clinton administration bombings of 1998.

<p> I returned to the United States with a view to be digested, something
 I
 would have to be very careful and thoughtful in sharing publicly, and 
 discerning in acceptance of a venue to do so. I waited out the first
series 
 of rabid attacks on my character, profession, intelligence,
experience, 
 agenda, ego, effectiveness, and patriotism. I chose to appear on Larry

 King's show, followed by an interview on The Active Opposition, a
World 
 Link TV political show hosted by my friend, Peter Coyote. This had
been the 
 extent of my public commentary on this issue in the United States,
when on 
 March 20, 2003, our President ordered our military into war with
Iraq.
<p> 
 If military intervention in Iraq has been a grave misjudgment, it has
 been
 one resulting in thousands upon thousands of deaths, and done so
without 
 any credible evidence of imminent threat to the United States. Our
flag has 
 been waving, it seems, in servicing a regime change significantly
 benefiting U.S. corporations. What remains to be seen is an effective
plan 
 for the rebuilding of the civilian infrastructure, or any other
benefit to 
 the people of Iraq or the United States. It is an achievement that
includes 
 the callous and too easily accepted term, "collateral damage." This is
a 
 term where proportionality of loss is taken from the people who have
lost, 
 and given to marketing executives.

<p> On Larry King's show, I appealed to American mothers and fathers to
 sit
 with a scrap of paper and a pencil and scribble the following words,
"Dear 
 Mr. and Mrs. (your name here), We regret to inform you that your
 son/daughter (child's name here) was killed in action in Iraq..." I
asked 
 that those mothers and fathers finish that letter in a way that would
 comfort them if they were to receive it. This war, for all its
military 
 triumph, would provide no satisfactory completion of that letter for
this 
 father. The human death toll of this corporate march includes those
 courageous and heroic Americans who lost their lives. As Americans 
 considering loss of life, we are at liberty to claim unbiased 
 humanitarianism, but few among us are ever so poignantly saddened as
with 
 the loss of a young American soldier fighting for his country in a
lonely, 
 foreign land. And I am no exception. And what of the wounds of body
and 
 spirit in many of those who survived? I ask to join in celebrating
those 
 soldiers, all of them. They are every bit the heroes of World War II,
of 
 Korea, and every bit the heroes of Vietnam (where postwar suicides of
 veterans totaled higher numbers than those killed in battle, and the
term 
 "collateral damage" broadened its scope). Unimaginable is the loss
felt by 
 the families of the dead. Are we willing to consider that the
righteous 
 execution of a soldier's duty, training, unity, and mission, has
always 
 stood or fallen, to the degree the citizens they serve struggle at
home for 
 the rights our soldiers pledge to fight for abroad? It should be noted
that 
 President Bush's 2004 budget proposed a 6.2 billion dollar cut in
Veterans' 
 health and welfare benefits.

<p> In re-evaluating the responsibility of citizenship and U.S. foreign
 policy
 in the post-9/11 age, there have been disparate opinions among
Americans 
 about how supporting our troops would now be defined, how supporting
our 
 principles would now be defined, and how the "rule of law" would now
be 
 upheld. In what way would dissent be most productive within a system
of 
 government that does not exist without questioning by its people? We
 accepted that journalists were "embedded" with reliance on their
subject, 
 the military, to keep them from harm's way. We found that our
Secretary of 
 State presented plagiarized and fictitious evidence of WMD's in Iraq
to the 
 American people and the world. We would rely on this, our government,
 acting alone, to uncover those weapons of mass destruction said to be 
 possessed by the Iraqis and originally said to have justified our
assault. 
 A similar justification came out of military sources in Baghdad, when
an 
 American tank fired on journalists on the sixth floor of the Palestine

 Hotel in response to shots claimed to have been fired on them from
that 
 building's lobby. In a hotel full of international journalists, not
one 
 heard the shots that the military reported to have preceded their
 "response". We would watch as the United Nations was described 
 "unnecessary," rather than useful, if only as an oversight committee,

inspiring some domestic and international faith in a new found
American 
 weapons inspections process that is covert at best. Any responsible
person 
 must ask, in whose hands our flag now waves and what perception the
world 
 may have of it in those hands.

<p> Even as the New York Times presents unchallenging articles (see Judith 
 Miller, April 21, 2003,"Prohibited Weapons") on a weapons inspections 
 process now in place, unnoticed are the legitimate concerns about
potential 
 insertion of WMD evidence. Our television channels show images of
grateful 
 and liberated Iraqis with no acknowledgement that true poverty will
bring 
 the best of us to our knees, where we would honor any individual or
nation 
 who held food. Our knowledge and understanding of Arab culture and
Islamic 
 belief is sketchy at best. While Saddam Hussein was certainly a beast
among 
 men, and while his people, to any degree that we would presume
 comprehension, were under the thumb of brutal oppression in his hands,
we 
 must reflect as we triumph at the image of an American soldier
cradling an 
 Iraqi infant, with no curiosity as to the fate of its parents. And
what of 
 the shocking rise in leukemias and other cancers in Iraq due to
 depleted uranium exposure and of the thousands of unexploded
ordinances, 
 both, gifts of U.S. artillery. Will we remember the hundreds of
thousands 
 of children who suffered slow and agonizing deaths by diarrhea? These
 primarily attributed to the U.S.- led sanctions in Iraq, where bombing
of 
 water treatment plants and an embargo on chlorine continued to ravage
 predominantly young victims. We must reflect on the certainty with
which we 
 were sold a war on the basis of what we now so expertly call WMDs. We
must 
 reflect on the resentment of the world, invited in our positioning
 ourselves as their police. With Syria, Iran, and North Korea on media
hit 
 lists, we must reflect on the availability of funds for violent
crusades in 
 the absence of funding crusades for healing the very real suffering of
our 
 own people and others.

<p> This is our money I speak of, not theirs. Ours. Our democracy. Our
 flag.
 (Lest we forget Enron) but, we see Exxon. We see Bechtel. We see 
 Halliburton. We see Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, Rice,
Perle, 
 Ashcroft, Murdoch, many. We see no WMDs. We see dead young Americans.
We 
 see no WMDs. We see dead Iraqi civilians. We see no WMDs. We see chaos
in 
 the Baghdad streets. But no WMDs. We see the disappearance of a
murderous 
 Iraqi dictator, who relented his struggle and ran without the use of
WMDs.

<p> Now I want to see one more thing. In Iraq, and in the United States, I

 want
 to see who's the boss. I want to see who's the people. I want to see
who 
 are the sheep. And I want to know the lions. I don't know what the
future 
 of the Iraqi people will be. I don't know what the future of our own
people 
 will be. I do know, that while we all watched the headlines, the
drama, the 
 indelible, the horrifying and forever unjustifiable violence that
occurred 
 in the United States on September 11, 2001, that it has diverted our
eyes 
 from the beauty of this country, and its foundation that act was
intended 
 to shake. It seems Osama Bin Laden's agenda is being furthered by our
fear, 
 promoted by the invective language of media and a Congress that
shamefully 
 cowers from criticism, as we hack away at the arms, the legs, and the
soul 
 of our own civil liberties, our constitution, our principles, and our
flag.

<p> There has never been a time when it has been more important for
 citizens to
 stand up, to speak, to agree, to disagree, to resolve, to be
non-violent. 
 To be nonviolent. When we allow prideful killers to define our value
as 
 presumption, then only murder can live in our dreams. We can't be
shamed 
 into hiding, frightened into line. We can't be less than yesterday.
And we 
can't sit still today. Not if we love our children. This is a question
of a 
 peoples' internal reflection preceding their government's external
reaction. 
 In 1939, William Saroyan wrote:
<p> "In the time of your life , live - so that in that good time there
 shall be
 no ugliness or death for yourself or for any life your life touches.
Seek 
 goodness everywhere, and when it is found, bring it out of its
hiding place 
 and let it be free and unashamed. Place in matter and in flesh the
least of 
 the values, for these are the things that hold death and must pass
away. 
 Discover in all things that which shines and is beyond corruption.
 Encourage virtue in whatever heart it may have been driven into
secrecy and 
 sorrow by the shame and terror of the world. Ignore the obvious, for
it is 
 unworthy of the clear eye and the kindly heart. Be the inferior of no
man, 
 nor of any man be the superior. Remember that every man is a variation
of 
 yourself. No man's guilt is not yours, nor is any man's innocence a
thing 
 apart. Despise evil and ungodliness, but not men of ungodliness or
evil. 
 These, understand. Have no shame in being kindly and gentle, but if
the 
 time comes in the time of your life to kill, kill and have no regret.
In 
 the time of your life, live - so that in that wondrous time you shall
not 
 add to the misery and sorrow of the world, but shall smile to the
infinite 
 delight and mystery of it."

<p> Philosophically, Saroyan offers a noble aspiration. But we have to be
 very
 careful, whether listening to the television after a hard day's work,
or 
 while reading a poem at a luxury resort, to be men and women of our
own 
 time. When he wrote about a time "to kill" he wrote in a world without

 nuclear proliferation, massive globalization, television, or the
decimation 
 of a nation's long held traditions. He was a man of his time as we are
of 
 ours. We are struggling now with the question of whether there is any
 longer a time to kill. We are grappling perhaps with memetic
evolution. God 
 help us, at some point we may need to exercise military action to
counter 
 real and specifically targeted threats. But real threats require the
 existence of real opposition in debating strategies where the lives of

 American soldiers and innocent civilians are threatened. With few
 exceptions, notably congresspeople Barbara Lee and Dennis Kucinich and

 Senators Robert Byrd and Ted Kennedy, the Democratic leadership has
been 
 entirely complicit. And it has been an obscene and cowardly betrayal
of 
 their constituencies.

<p> I'm not a Democrat, not a Republican, not a Green, not aligned with
 any
 party. Yet, as a citizen of the United States, I was raised in the
public 
 school system of the 1960's and '70s. Each morning, following the
first 
 bell, we were called upon as young boys and girls to stand, put our
right 
 hand over our hearts, and pledge allegiance to the flag of our
country. As 
 a schoolboy, I participated in this tradition unquestioningly and by
rote. 
 When in fact, neither flag, nor country, nor school for that matter,
is of 
 much interest to most young boys dreaming of bicycle rides, surfing,
or the 
 girl in the front of the class. (Was it the way the flag waved or the
wave 
 of her hair I'd pledged to?... I don't remember.)

<p> Of course, with age, and maturity, come examination of, and rebellion 
 toward, the traditions and compulsory behaviors of our childhood. With
some 
 time however, we gain at least an objective appreciation and respect
for 
 the great symbol of sacrifice and heroism reflected in such an icon as
our 
 flag (albeit historically and presently intermingled with varying
degrees 
 of corruption and exploitation). Ultimately though, as with many
things in 
 this life, these symbols are vulnerable to underappreciation, until we
have 
lost them. I am an American and I fear that I, and our people are on
the 
 verge of losing our flag. If it is lost, it will have been under our
watch, 
 under mine and undermined.
<p> Only five short years ago, September 12th, 1998, I sat upon a wooden
 church
 pew as a military honor guard reached across my lap to place a
precisely 
 folded American flag into the stoic hands of my father's widow. His
beloved 
 wife of forty-one years... my mother. My dad, Leo Penn had died from
lung 
 cancer at the age of 77. (The last time I saw my father was in a
viewing 
 casket on September 11th.) A decorated soldier in World War II and a
 blacklisted artist in the '50s, it was this cloth of Stars and Stripes
and 
 all it had meant to him, and had come to mean to me, that brought
 unexpected and unrestrained emotion. The soldier, in his fine dress 
 uniform, began to speak to my mother "In the name of the President of
the 
 United States and in gratitude for your husband's heroic..." And that
was 
 it, I was gone. I thought, where the hell did this flood of emotion
come from?

<p> But, the answer came quickly. My father loved this country so deeply,
 and
 he had passed that love and patriotism on to his three sons. At that 
 moment, this son, this distracted boy from the public school system,
became 
 all that patriotic could describe in a living civilian, and that flag
 before my mother's now gently tear-streaked face, came to embody every

 freedom, privilege, and pride I'd ever known. It symbolized my father.
His 
 great heart, his kindness, his courage, and yes, even his (I was
 lucky)occasional human lapses.

<p> Yet, now here we are, just those five short years have passed, and
 that
 same flag that took me so long to love, respect, and protect,
threatens to 
 become a haunting banner of murder, greed, and treason against our
 principles, honored history, Constitution, and our own mothers and
fathers. 
 To become a vulgar billboard, advertising our disloyalty to ourselves
and 
 our allies. Our forefathers entrusted that flag and what it should
stand 
 for, whether in times of bliss or terror, to our fathers and mothers.
And 
 they have entrusted it to us. The responsibility"for which it stands"
is 
 ours. That flag is my father and I want him back.

<p> It is May 2, 2003 -- a grey day in Northern California. My now
 12-year-old
 daughter is on the phone in our kitchen organizing a movie-going
troupe of 
 friends for a Friday evening show. "Is CHICAGO still playing?" They
want a 
 second viewing. They want song. And they want dance. My son is outside

 skateboarding (perhaps dreaming of the girl in the front of the
class). 
 President George W. Bush was having his back slapped on the aircraft
 carrier Abraham Lincoln yesterday. He seemed quite pleased with this,
his 
 military service. He likes it better now than he did when he was a
member 
 of the Texas National Guard, when in 1972, he simply failed to show up
for 
 duty for over a year in wartime. I certainly wouldn't want to remind
him 
 that were he AWOL in a time of war, it would amount to treasonous
 desertion. Yet, beside him, in his self-satisfaction, much of our
country, 
 losing jobs, and increasing debt, is portrayed as being quite pleased
with 
 him,too. And why not? This is his debutante ball, isn't it? This young
man 
 of privilege, who never had the curiosity to set foot outside our
country 
 before becoming our President, was dressed in his "top gun" jumper,
flown 
 in, onto the flight deck of the Lincoln. I didn't need a second
viewing of 
 this one. Tom Cruise was fine by me. Like my daughter and her friends,
I'm 
 in the mood for a little song and dance, too. But while we sing and
while 
 we dance, can it be a song of hope? Can we share a drink among friends
and 
 be responsible enough not to drive home, killing the child of another
with 
a recklessly driven car? Can we consider United States' policy
 internationally? Can we consider that the Afghans, Iraqis, Africans,
so 
 many, and yes, even here in America need food, water, medicine, hope
and 
 sweet dreams? That entire cultures are disintegrating and will be gone
in 
 our childrens' lifetime. That the millions of people in need who make
up so 
 much of the world, where we stand as the greatest Democracy in its
history, 
 leave us to dance with them in our hearts and minds, or, to dance upon

 them, their graves and those of their children.
<p> We are being told that the needs of these people and nations are being

 met.
 We are being told that our principles and our nation's rewards are
being 
 preserved and won for our people. We have been told many things. But
if we 
 do not participate in an educated democracy, we participate in its
demise. 
 We all have different means. Be it a letter to a congressman, charity
 support, or a piece in the New York Times. But whatever our means, and

 imagination, we must speak. We must question. We must value ourselves,
our 
 integrity, our families, our hearts, and the country my father and so
many 
 others served. And soon, we must do one more thing... we must vote.

<p> "Dad, can you drive us to the movies?" Duty calls.
