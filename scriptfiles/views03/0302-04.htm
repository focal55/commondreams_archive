<p>Does it matter what the rest of the world - the non-aligned, the poor, the distant and the peripheral - thinks about this war? They won't do the fighting, and probably very little of the subsequent peace-keeping. <P>They are largely irrelevant. Except that it hasn't felt quite like that in Sri Lanka these past few days, gathered with more than 80 editors from 34 Commonwealth countries.  <P>Here, in all but a very few cases, are journalists who don't belong to the big Western chains. From the Solomon Islands to Malawi, from Bangladesh to Barbados, they have responsibilities: to think for themselves and to reflect - or at least acknowledge - the views of the readers they serve. And those views are trenchant, going on vehement.  <P>Nobody has a good word to say about terrorism. But nobody, either, has an even half good word to say about Mr Bush or Mr Blair. I've canvassed most of the participants at the Commonwealth Press Union (CPU) forum. We may bank on winning the war (Colonel Mike Dewar, late of the Institute of Strategic Studies, came and gave Saddam a week of fighting before he got flattened) but there is absolutely no sign of us winning the argument.  <P>Reasons? They vary, of course. The Australian and Canadian editors have their own take on domestic public opinion. The British are torn between uncertainty and support for 'our boys'. But African, Caribbean, Asian and Pacific editors may, with broad accuracy, be rolled into a single basket.  <P>The assumption back in London is that the aftermath of victory will erase all doubts and most sorrows. Once Saddam is gone, dead or captured, his generals and scientists will be offering Western reporters guided tours around his warehouses of mass destruction. Our leaders will be self-proclaimed saviors.
<P>It's a perception that gives Fleet Street cause for pause. The readers of most papers may - in research terms - be hostile to attacking Baghdad, but enough proof of horrors averted will soon swing them around. And what about the print opponents of war then, caught in the headlight glare of outraged hindsight?  <P>But the difficulty in the rest of the world goes precisely the other way. It is America's emphasis on 'pre-emptive self-defense' after 11 September that causes the greatest hostility. Newspaper after newspaper in country after country doesn't doubt that the Pentagon can and probably will win quickly. What they fear, rather, is the result of swift and (on the American or British side)   largely painless victory. For that raises the inevitable follow-up question: who comes next? If we lose track of our politics, succumb to some grotty military takeover, could it even be us?  
<P>The motive, in short, is apprehension, if not quite fear. The difficulty that follows in train, already acknowledged by the more thoughtful editors and war correspondents, is that distrust runs so deep that it's bound to infect responses to Western media reporting, too.  <P>Sir Mark Tully made that point in a speech. He foresaw a 'gross and total lack of confidence' in the West's media. He lamented the lack, over years, of any proper examination of the haunting problem called 'Why do they hate us so?'  <P>Perhaps it's too late already. The media axis of Anglo-American satellite broadcasters is out of time there. But the parallel problem of reporting the war has barely been addressed yet - and carries, in its emerging disciplines, the seeds of its own disillusion.  <P>American reporters - heavily circumscribed - are being assigned to American frontline units. What they'll see and what they'll be able to report remains unsure in a theatre where 'operational imperatives' reign.  <P>British correspondents, still mired in the MoD, may expect some similar opportunities (though much will depend on what our boys are actually asked to do). But will there be room in the tanks for Zambians, Indians, Sri Lankans? Access impossible. It's the Western agencies - Reuters, Associated Press - who'll take the strain. That, in these fraught circumstances, is not ideal. British or American agencies, however unfairly, aren't going to be automatically trusted. And the balance of two sides and two perspectives that any war reporting needs is bound to be vestigial, verging on non-existent.  <P>There'll be no safety guarantees for even Western correspondents taking a chance   on going it alone. On the contrary, they are being specifically warned that using their satellite phones could make them targets for unfriendly missile fire. On the Iraqi side, moreover, the opening days of blitzkrieg will make reporting not merely dangerous, but lethal. Other Iraqi cities, from Basra on, may find their fall essentially unreported.  <P>That imbalance may just be acceptable in Washington or London, but how will it play among my Commonwealth friends? Badly, structurally badly. The image of the superpower carrying all before it will be reinforced, the skepticism doubled.  
<P>To repeat though: does that matter? Do we care about hearts and minds in the world beyond the Pentagon and Capitol Hill? This - unlike the Gulf - is the first big war with no consensus behind it. This one leaves the peripheries out. This one, at present, says simply that we don't care - which is precisely what my Sri Lankan editors have already glumly concluded.
