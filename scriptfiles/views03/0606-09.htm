<p><i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>
<p>NOT.<p><i>Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.</i>
<p>UNLESS you can prove we used coercion.
<p><i>You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning.</i>
<p>IF you are smart enough to ask for one.<p><i>If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you at government expense.</i>
<p>IF we decide to charge you with a criminal act.<p>So ruled the Supreme Court Justices, on May 27, 2003, as they dismissed the foundation of the Miranda Law, in a 6-3 decision, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, in the case of Chavez v. Martinez (No. 01-1444).<p>The reach and scope of the decision is far greater than the fate of Oliverio Martinez. In the supporting opinions of the decision, the Supreme Court challenges what it calls the "prophylactic" effect of the Miranda Law. In their ruling, the Justices determined that Martinez's rights of self- incrimination or due process were not violated because he was not charged with a crime.<p>Prior to this ruling, in order to safeguard the Fifth Amendment, a person in custody, before any interrogation, was to be clearly informed that he / she had the right to remain silent. It is important to note that, you or I, without being charged, can be interrogated and / or arrested.<p>In 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested in Phoenix, Arizona for armed robbery of a bank worker. While in police custody he signed a written confession to the robbery, and to kidnapping and raping a developmentally disabled 18-year-old woman. After the conviction, his lawyers appealed, on the grounds that Miranda did not know he was protected from self-incrimination.<p>The State of Arizona took the case to the Supreme Court. In a 1966 ruling, the Court, in upholding Miranda, sited from 1897 Bram v. United States, and 1924 Wan v. United States, in support of the Fifth Amendment, that, " a confession obtained by compulsion must be excluded whatever may have been the character of the compulsion, and whether the compulsion was applied in a judicial proceeding or otherwise."<p>The "Miranda Rule" was born. Thanks to the media and network TV, most citizens now know the ruling by heart. Subsequently, we have come to expect a level of protection from deceptive police interrogations and / or coercion.<p>Law enforcement agencies have consistently lobbied against Miranda, stating that it tied their hands during arrests and questioning.<p>Pressure from the Federal Government led Congress to pass a law in 1968 in an attempt to skirt the Miranda ruling. This law stated, "Prosecutors in federal cases can use statements gathered without informing suspects of their Miranda rights, as long as the statements were given voluntarily." The decision was highly criticized for weakening defendant's rights, and in June 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Dickerson "the 1966 Supreme Court ruling had precedence over the 1968 federal law because the ruling was based on constitutional rights."<p>At question, is the intent of the Framers of the Constitution. What rights were they trying to protect? One possibility: protection from a government acting however it wished, by simply saying that an individual was a suspected criminal.<p>In November 1997, Oliverio Martinez rode his bicycle into the middle of an ongoing narcotics investigation. He was ordered to dismount; Officer Salina patted him down, then there was a scuffle. Salina yelled, "he's got my gun," (this fact is in dispute). Officer Pena fired several shots. Five bullets struck Martinez, one in the face, which rendered him blind, one in the spine, which paralyzed his legs. He was handcuffed in this state, and questioned by Officer Chavez, both during the ambulance ride and while undergoing emergency treatment. Martinez cried several times, "I'm dying," to which Officer Chavez replied, "OK, yes you are dying, but tell me why you are fighting, were you fighting with the police?"<p>Martinez sued the City of Oxnard and Officer Chavez on the grounds that they violated his constitutional rights (Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and 14th Amendments) by stopping him without probable cause, using excessive force, tampering with evidence, inflicting cruel and unusual punishment, and subjecting him to coercive interrogation.<p>The Bush administration joined with the city of Oxnard. In briefs filed in December 2002, U.S. Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson and Michael Chertoff, stated, "Police can hold people in custody and force them to talk, so long as their incriminating statements are not used to prosecute them."<p>Those statements seem as far from the intention of the Framers as I can possibly imagine. To watch as the Supreme Court tampers with the Constitution is cause for great distress. To discover political pressure influences the Court, is even more disturbing.<p>Who among us can be questioned? When and why? What further rights have we just witnessed slip away?
