<p>Whatever their grounds for doing so, it now seems clear that the Bush administration lied about its rationale for going to war with Iraq. When Secretary of State Colin Powell, President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld individually guaranteed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, they did so - in the words of a recent internal intelligence report - with a "lack of any direct information." Now, even Bush himself is backing away from the claim that Iraq had such weapons.

<p>The question to ask now is: What does it matter? Most people agree that the Iraqis are better off today than under Hussein's Ba'athist party, that whatever the future of Iraq holds, it is more hopeful than its immediate past. And few are shedding tears for the old regime. So perhaps a lack of truthfulness from the U.S. government has little or no downside, as long as the results are so positive.

<p>On the other hand, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bush's closest international ally, has been politically handicapped by the lack of WMD evidence in Iraq; clearly, falsification does matter in politics. Bush administration critics argue that American credibility has been damaged, and that our foreign policy will suffer as a result. What, they worry, will become of an America whose statements are no longer believed?

<p>Neither approach takes into account that Americans have historical experience with specious justifications for warfare. The past century of American history provides two notably similar instances, parallel both for impelling a skeptical American population toward war and for their ultimate misrepresentation.

<p>The first, the 1898 sinking of the battleship USS Maine, triggered the Spanish-American War. Most historians have concluded that the incident in Havana harbor was not caused by the Spanish, but was the result of an internal explosion. Nonetheless, it led not just to war but also to the U.S. occupation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines.

<p>The second, the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, occurred when President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration fabricated a torpedo attack on U.S. warships off North Vietnam in order to justify a massive escalation in the Vietnam War. In the latter case, unlike the Maine, the American government could ascertain that the "enemy" had done no such thing.

<p>These examples do not precisely match the case of Iraq, of course, but both shed light on the claims of both opponents and champions of Bush's war. In each case, U.S. power expanded in the war's wake, even as doubts arose about American integrity. The United States emerged as an imperial power at the beginning of the 20th century, and Vietnam clearly showed the world that the United States stood ready to go to war to protect its interests. Our government's chicanery may even have strengthened its place in the world, as it became less predictable and more dangerous.

<p>Truth, then, has little to do with power. In both of these cases, the falsity of the claim did not lessen U.S. power in the world. At each time, strong domestic pressures also supported the deception. The fires of the Spanish-American war were fed by William Randolph Hearst's chain of newspapers, whose bias and lack of accuracy make today's Fox News look like The Nation. Johnson had the support of a Democratic Party eager to be "tough on communism" and a mass media all too willing to accept whatever the president declared.

<p>Like today, the aftermath of the falsehoods not only reinforced the nation's power abroad, but also that of the presidency. Those on the left should not be surprised that Bush continues to be taken seriously by Arab governments and by most Americans.

<p>But the effects of fabrications are not limited to how others are influenced; if they were, deception would only be morally wrong if uncovered. Philosophers from Socrates to Kant have argued that lying is itself morally damaging, that those who lie are themselves harmed by the act. If true, then the results of duplicity are measured not by influence in the world, but by its effects on the soul.

<p>Again, these two historical examples illuminate this point. Vietnam not only destroyed Johnson's legacy but also profoundly damaged the nation, turning Americans against their institutions and one another. Our seizure of the Spanish empire became a moral failure; the occupation ended up killing more than half a million Filipinos over the years, and we managed our relationship with Cuba so badly that many Cubans eventually welcomed the rule of Fidel Castro.

<p>In both cases, the worst aspect was that those who lied were affected by their own fictions, justifying their deceptions in the name of something bigger. America ostensibly started these wars to free people from oppression, but the falsity of the reasons for the wars resulted in conflicts far less moral than those waged for honest reasons.

<p>Pragmatically, then, it may seem that the cause of freedom can justify falsehoods. And in terms of world influence, it very well might. But those lies themselves corrupt our own society. Just as we teach children of the inherent wrongs of fabrication, we must learn that their effects are not limited to how others perceive them, but include how we understand our society and ourselves. Perhaps someday we will recognize that misleading the world and ourselves serves as a sign that all is not right with our own political climate.
