<p>Recently my university, the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown (UPJ) and its parent, the University of Pittsburgh, have added Homeland Security information to their web-sites.  The differences in substance and style between them are striking, but both reveal their own and the government’s insincere attempts at terrorism preparedness and do little more than promote the new politics of fear.  Thus far the other Pitt campuses, Bradford, Greensburg and Titusville, have opted not to post information about the Code Orange Threat Level on the web.
<p>The University of Pittsburgh’s site “Pitt Police response to elevation of Homeland Security Advisory System to ‘High Security Risk’” is accessible via <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Epolice" target="_new">http://www.pitt.edu/~police</a>  This low profile site announces that the University has “instituted a number of heightened security measures” including communication with the FBI, increased patrols, and a review of “response procedures.”  
<p>UPJ, by contrast, added the color-coded “Homeland Security Advisory System” emblem to the front of its site <a href="http://www.upj.pitt.edu/" target="_new">http://www.upj.pitt.edu/</a> on February 21.  Clicking on the emblem links to another page where the color bar is larger still, and the “High Risk of Terrorist Attack” button is flashing orange.  The page contains no information about UPJ’s preparedness for a “Terrorist Attack,” or advice about how the community should respond to one.  It says simply, “We are committed to communicate levels of threat to our campus community,” and carries links to government web-sites.  Earlier, on February 11, UPJ sent a memorandum to the University Community stating that “a plan is in place in the unlikely event of an incident on campus,” but it provides no hint of what that plan might be, or how the community should respond.
<p>Whereas Pitt has taken some token steps to soothe anxious parents and the university community, UPJ is feeding the politics of fear.  While both institutions do warn their communities, neither appears to be sufficiently preparing for the“threat” they identify.  Have either conducted preparedness drills, or considered their institutional role in a regional response?  Without providing information on how to respond, UPJ’s current flashing alert only encourages a climate of fear.  Such “alerts” without practical preparedness guidelines are socially irresponsible.
<p>During the Cold War, the U.S. government used fear to sell Americans the policy of “Containment of Communism” by telling them they could survive nuclear attack with bomb shelters, ducking and covering, or seeking refuge in fall-out shelters.  Today, the government is using fear again to sell the policy of "Pre-emption of Terrorism" by instructing people to buy duct tape, plastic sheeting and provisions, and to prepare an insulated, terror-proof room.  Intelligent people should know that none of this will protect them from “dirty bombs,” anthrax, smallpox, ricin, or nerve gas.  
<p>The Office of Homeland Security has created this Advisory System, but like Pitt and UPJ, it has done little to prepare the people for terrorists’ use of Weapons of Mass Destruction.  Where are the plans for the evacuation of Washington, D.C.,  New York and Philadelphia? Have we in the mountains and beyond been prepared to house, feed, clothe, and medicate the millions from the Megalopolis next door when they flee west across I-80, I-76, and I-70?  None of this has been planned.  The reality is that the HSAS is a micro-thin veil of security covering the government's true face of fear mongering for the purpose of preparing the American people to support its policy of Pre-emption.
<p>This is fear mongering not security, and no University, no rational, intelligent, or august academic institution should play a part in it.  Similar hysteria in the 1940s and 1950s eventually led to loyalty oaths, FBI investigations, and the purging of university faculty who questioned conformity to government policy.  I wonder, as I write this, if in a few months or years from now, if the government deems anyone who questions homeland security to be aiding and abetting terrorism, if then Pitt or UPJ will name names, and if mine will be first?  Supporting simple fear mongering has led to witch-hunts in the recent past and there is no reason to think it cannot do so again.  If Universities want to flash the orange alert, then they should spend the time and the money that is necessary to really prepare for disaster.  But in the meantime, the Academy should not support the politics of fear.</p>
