<p>Good jobs, clean air and safer communities -- these things, we can all agree, are more important than politics. But it's easy to forget this simple truth during front-page political dramas such as the one that unfolded last week when I was named a San Francisco public utilities commissioner with architect Robin Chiang. 

<p>In the last few days, I've received hundreds of e-mails and faxes and spoken to dozens of San Franciscans. The overwhelming majority of people I've heard from want the city to move on. We have important work to do. 

<p>When the people of San Francisco and its leaders focus on common ground, they accomplish great things. For example, Mayor Willie Brown has shown exemplary leadership in addressing the pollution from the Hunters Point power plant, which especially threatens the health of our children, the sick and seniors. Last December, the Board of Supervisors approved energy plans to balance the need for security, clean air and affordability. As a PUC commissioner, I'm committed to implementing these energy plans and accomplishing the other PUC priorities, from closing down the dirty Hunters Point plant to implementing water-system upgrades to accelerating the adoption of water and energy conservation measures. 

<p>San Francisco is poised to become a global leader in the quickly growing clean-energy economy of the future. This week, in my first official act as a PUC commissioner, I intend to visit the recently installed, 675-kilowatt solar- electric rooftop on Moscone Center -- the first of several planned solar projects initiated as a result of the $100 million solar bond initiative passed by 73 percent of San Francisco voters in 2001. 

<p>Clean energy goes beyond reducing pollution and preventing asthma. Clean energy is also about creating jobs and maintaining our global economic competitiveness. With the help of the federal government, American companies invented solar technologies several decades ago. But as the federal government's commitment has flagged, the American share of the global market has continually shrunk. (The solar panels on the roof of Moscone Center, for instance, were manufactured in Japan by San-yo.) Meanwhile, here in San Francisco, members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members helped install the Moscone Center solar panels and created one of the country's leading solar apprenticeship programs. Now American steelworkers, autoworkers and aerospace workers need to follow the IBEW's example and make the world's finest solar panels, clean cars and wind turbines. 

<p>Over the past year, I've been helping to develop a labor-business- environmental alliance to push for a public-private venture called a "<a href="http://www.apolloalliance.org/" target="_new">New Apollo Project</a>" to invest billions in clean energy and efficiency to create millions of new jobs. Apollo has been endorsed by 17 of America's largest unions and major environmental groups. Later this week, I'll introduce Howard Dean to the New Apollo Project in San Francisco and invite the rest of the presidential candidates, including President Bush, to adopt the plan. Most of all, I'm committed to rolling up my sleeves, moving beyond political fractures and working with the mayor, the supervisors and the PUC to solve the big challenges -- jobs, clean air and safer communities -- in a way that unites us all.
