<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>In these times, when we have to race to keep abreast of the speed 
          at which our freedoms are being snatched from us, and when few can afford 
          the luxury of retreating from the streets for a while in order to return 
          with an exquisite, fully formed political thesis replete with footnotes 
          and references, what profound gift can I offer you tonight?</i></font>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          As we lurch from crisis to crisis, beamed directly into our brains by 
          satellite TV, we have to think on our feet. On the move. We enter histories 
          through the rubble of war. Ruined cities, parched fields, shrinking 
          forests, and dying rivers are our archives. Craters left by daisy cutters, 
          our libraries.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          So what can I offer you tonight? Some uncomfortable thoughts about money, 
          war, empire, racism, and democracy. Some worries that flit around my 
          brain like a family of persistent moths that keep me awake at night.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Some of you will think it bad manners for a person like me, officially 
          entered in the Big Book of Modern Nations as an &quot;Indian citizen,&quot; 
          to come here and criticize the U.S. government. Speaking for myself, 
          I'm no flag-waver, no patriot, and am fully aware that venality, brutality, 
          and hypocrisy are imprinted on the leaden soul of every state. But when 
          a country ceases to be merely a country and becomes an empire, then 
          the scale of operations changes dramatically. So may I clarify that 
          tonight I speak as a subject of the American Empire? I speak as a slave 
          who presumes to criticize her king. </font></i>

          Way back in 1988, on the 3rd of July, the U.S.S. Vincennes, a missile 
          cruiser stationed in the Persian Gulf, accidentally shot down an Iranian 
          airliner and killed 290 civilian passengers. George Bush the First, 
          who was at the time on his presidential campaign, was asked to comment 
          on the incident. He said quite subtly, &quot;I will never apologize 
          for the United States. I don't care what the facts are.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>
          I don't care what the facts are.</i> What a perfect maxim for the New 
          American Empire. Perhaps a slight variation on the theme would be more 
          apposite: <i>The facts can be whatever we want them to be.</i></font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          When the United States invaded Iraq, a New York Times/CBS News survey 
          estimated that 42 percent of the American public believed that Saddam 
          Hussein was directly responsible for the September 11th attacks on the 
          World Trade Center and the Pentagon. And an ABC News poll said that 
          55 percent of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein directly supported 
          Al Qaida. None of this opinion is based on evidence (because there isn't 
          any). All of it is based on insinuation, auto-suggestion, and outright 
          lies circulated by the U.S. corporate media, otherwise known as the 
          &quot;Free Press,&quot; that hollow pillar on which contemporary American 
          democracy rests. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Public support in the U.S. for the war against Iraq was founded on a 
          multi-tiered edifice of falsehood and deceit, coordinated by the U.S. 
          government and faithfully amplified by the corporate media. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Apart from the invented links between Iraq and Al Qaida, we had the 
          manufactured frenzy about Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction. George 
          Bush the Lesser went to the extent of saying it would be &quot;suicidal&quot; 
          for the U.S. not to attack Iraq. We once again witnessed the paranoia 
          that a starved, bombed, besieged country was about to annihilate almighty 
          America. (Iraq was only the latest in a succession of countries - earlier 
          there was Cuba, Nicaragua, Libya, Grenada, and Panama.) But this time 
          it wasn't just your ordinary brand of friendly neighborhood frenzy. 
          It was Frenzy with a Purpose. It ushered in an old doctrine in a new 
          bottle: the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Strike, <i>a.k.a. </i>The United 
          States Can Do Whatever The Hell It Wants, And That's Official.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          The war against Iraq has been fought and won and no Weapons of Mass 
          Destruction have been found. Not even a little one. Perhaps they'll 
          have to be planted before they're discovered. And then, the more troublesome 
          amongst us will need an explanation for why Saddam Hussein didn't use 
          them when his country was being invaded. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Of course, there'll be no answers. True Believers will make do with 
          those fuzzy TV reports about the discovery of a few barrels of banned 
          chemicals in an old shed. There seems to be no consensus yet about whether 
          they're really chemicals, whether they're actually banned and whether 
          the vessels they're contained in can technically be called barrels. 
          (There were unconfirmed rumours that a teaspoonful of potassium permanganate 
          and an old harmonica were found there too.) </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Meanwhile, in passing, an ancient civilization has been casually decimated 
          by a very recent, casually brutal nation. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Then there are those who say, so what if Iraq had no chemical and nuclear 
          weapons? So what if there is no Al Qaida connection? So what if Osama 
          bin Laden hates Saddam Hussein as much as he hates the United States? 
          Bush the Lesser has said Saddam Hussein was a &quot;Homicidal Dictator.&quot; 
          And so, the reasoning goes, Iraq needed a &quot;regime change.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Never mind that forty years ago, the CIA, under President John F. Kennedy, 
          orchestrated a regime change in Baghdad. In 1963, after a successful 
          coup, the Ba'ath party came to power in Iraq. Using lists provided by 
          the CIA, the new Ba'ath regime systematically eliminated hundreds of 
          doctors, teachers, lawyers, and political figures known to be leftists. 
          An entire intellectual community was slaughtered. (The same technique 
          was used to massacre hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia and 
          East Timor.) The young Saddam Hussein was said to have had a hand in 
          supervising the bloodbath. In 1979, after factional infighting within 
          the Ba'ath Party, Saddam Hussein became the President of Iraq. In April 
          1980, while he was massacring Shias, the U.S. National Security Adviser 
          Zbigniew Brzezinksi declared, &quot;We see no fundamental incompatibility 
          of interests between the United States and Iraq.&quot; Washington and 
          London overtly and covertly supported Saddam Hussein. They financed 
          him, equipped him, armed him, and provided him with dual-use materials 
          to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. They supported his worst 
          excesses financially, materially, and morally. They supported the eight-year 
          war against Iran and the 1988 gassing of Kurdish people in Halabja, 
          crimes which 14 years later were re-heated and served up as reasons 
          to justify invading Iraq. After the first Gulf War, the &quot;Allies&quot; 
          fomented an uprising of Shias in Basra and then looked away while Saddam 
          Hussein crushed the revolt and slaughtered thousands in an act of vengeful 
          reprisal. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          The point is, if Saddam Hussein was evil enough to merit the most elaborate, 
          openly declared assassination attempt in history (the opening move of 
          Operation Shock and Awe), then surely those who supported him ought 
          at least to be tried for war crimes? Why aren't the faces of U.S. and 
          U.K. government officials on the infamous pack of cards of wanted men 
          and women?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Because when it comes to Empire, facts don't matter. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Yes, but all that's in the past we're told. Saddam Hussein is a monster 
          who must be stopped <i>now</i>. And only the U.S. can stop him. It's 
          an effective technique, this use of the urgent morality of the present 
          to obscure the diabolical sins of the past and the malevolent plans 
          for the future. Indonesia, Panama, Nicaragua, Iraq, Afghanistan - the 
          list goes on and on. Right now there are brutal regimes being groomed 
          for the future - Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan, the Central 
          Asian Republics. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft recently declared that U.S. freedoms 
          are &quot;not the grant of any government or document, but&#133;.our 
          endowment from God.&quot; (Why bother with the United Nations when God 
          himself is on hand?)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          So here we are, the people of the world, confronted with an Empire armed 
          with a mandate from heaven (<i>and</i>, as added insurance, the most 
          formidable arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in history). Here 
          we are, confronted with an Empire that has conferred upon itself the 
          right to go to war at will, and the right to deliver people from corrupting 
          ideologies, from religious fundamentalists, dictators, sexism, and poverty 
          by the age-old, tried-and-tested practice of extermination. Empire is 
          on the move, and Democracy is its sly new war cry. Democracy, home-delivered 
          to your doorstep by daisy cutters. Death is a small price for people 
          to pay for the privilege of sampling this new product: Instant-Mix Imperial 
          Democracy (bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          But then perhaps chinks, negroes, dinks, gooks, and wogs don't really 
          qualify as real people. Perhaps our deaths don't qualify as real deaths. 
          Our histories don't qualify as history. They never have.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of history, in these 
          past months, while the world watched, the U.S. invasion and occupation 
          of Iraq was broadcast on live TV. Like Osama bin Laden and the Taliban 
          in Afghanistan, the regime of Saddam Hussein simply disappeared. This 
          was followed by what analysts called a &quot;power vacuum.&quot; Cities 
          that had been under siege, without food, water, and electricity for 
          days, cities that had been bombed relentlessly, people who had been 
          starved and systematically impoverished by the UN sanctions regime for 
          more than a decade, were suddenly left with no semblance of urban administration. 
          A seven-thousand-year-old civilization slid into anarchy. On live TV. 
          </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Vandals plundered shops, offices, hotels, and hospitals. American and 
          British soldiers stood by and watched. They said they had no orders 
          to act. In effect, they had orders to kill people, but not to protect 
          them. Their priorities were clear. The safety and security of Iraqi 
          people was not their business. The security of whatever little remained 
          of Iraq's infrastructure was not their business. But the security and 
          safety of Iraq's oil fields were. Of course they were. The oil fields 
          were &quot;secured&quot; almost before the invasion began. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          On CNN and BBC the scenes of the rampage were played and replayed. TV 
          commentators, army and government spokespersons portrayed it as a &quot;liberated 
          people&quot; venting their rage at a despotic regime. U.S. Defense Secretary 
          Donald Rumsfeld said: &quot;It's untidy. Freedom's untidy and free people 
          are free to commit crimes and make mistakes and do bad things.&quot; 
          Did anybody know that Donald Rumsfeld was an anarchist? I wonder - did 
          he hold the same view during the riots in Los Angeles following the 
          beating of Rodney King? Would he care to share his thesis about the 
          Untidiness of Freedom with the two million people being held in U.S. 
          prisons right now? (The world's &quot;freest&quot; country has the highest 
          number of prisoners in the world.) Would he discuss its merits with 
          young African American men, 28 percent of whom will spend some part 
          of their adult lives in jail? Could he explain why he serves under a 
          president who oversaw 152 executions when he was governor of Texas?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Before the war on Iraq began, the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian 
          Assistance (ORHA) sent the Pentagon a list of 16 crucial sites to protect. 
          The National Museum was second on that list. Yet the Museum was not 
          just looted, it was desecrated. It was a repository of an ancient cultural 
          heritage. Iraq as we know it today was part of the river valley of Mesopotamia. 
          The civilization that grew along the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates 
          produced the world's first writing, first calendar, first library, first 
          city, and, yes, the world's first democracy. King Hammurabi of Babylon 
          was the first to codify laws governing the social life of citizens. 
          It was a code in which abandoned women, prostitutes, slaves, and even 
          animals had rights. The Hammurabi code is acknowledged not just as the 
          birth of legality, but the beginning of an understanding of the concept 
          of social justice. The U.S. government could not have chosen a more 
          inappropriate land in which to stage its illegal war and display its 
          grotesque disregard for justice.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          At a Pentagon briefing during the days of looting, Secretary Rumsfeld, 
          Prince of Darkness, turned on his media cohorts who had served him so 
          loyally through the war. &quot;The images you are seeing on television, 
          you are seeing over and over and over, and it's the same picture, of 
          some person walking out of some building with a vase, and you see it 
          twenty times and you say, 'My god, were there that many vases? Is it 
          possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?'&quot; 
          </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Laughter rippled through the press room. Would it be alright for the 
          poor of Harlem to loot the Metropolitan Museum? Would it be greeted 
          with similar mirth?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          The last building on the ORHA list of 16 sites to be protected was the 
          Ministry of Oil. It was the only one that was given protection. Perhaps 
          the occupying army thought that in Muslim countries lists are read upside 
          down?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Television tells us that Iraq has been &quot;liberated&quot; and that 
          Afghanistan is well on its way to becoming a paradise for women-thanks 
          to Bush and Blair, the 21st century's leading feminists. In reality, 
          Iraq's infrastructure has been destroyed. Its people brought to the 
          brink of starvation. Its food stocks depleted. And its cities devastated 
          by a complete administrative breakdown. Iraq is being ushered in the 
          direction of a civil war between Shias and Sunnis. Meanwhile, Afghanistan 
          has lapsed back into the pre-Taliban era of anarchy, and its territory 
          has been carved up into fiefdoms by hostile warlords. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Undaunted by all this, on the 2nd of May Bush the Lesser launched his 
          2004 campaign hoping to be finally elected U.S. President. In what probably 
          constitutes the shortest flight in history, a military jet landed on 
          an aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>, which was so 
          close to shore that, according to the Associated Press, administration 
          officials acknowledged &quot;positioning the massive ship to provide 
          the best TV angle for Bush's speech, with the sea as his background 
          instead of the San Diego coastline.&quot; President Bush, who never 
          served his term in the military, emerged from the cockpit in fancy dress 
          - a U.S. military bomber jacket, combat boots, flying goggles, helmet. 
          Waving to his cheering troops, he officially proclaimed victory over 
          Iraq. He was careful to say that it was &quot;just one victory in a 
          war on terror &#133; [which] still goes on.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          It was important to avoid making a straightforward victory announcement, 
          because under the Geneva Convention a victorious army is bound by the 
          legal obligations of an occupying force, a responsibility that the Bush 
          administration does not want to burden itself with. Also, closer to 
          the 2004 elections, in order to woo wavering voters, another victory 
          in the &quot;War on Terror&quot; might become necessary. Syria is being 
          fattened for the kill.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          It was Herman Goering, that old Nazi, who said, &quot;People can always 
          be brought to the bidding of the leaders.&#133; All you have to do is 
          tell them they're being attacked and denounce the pacifists for a lack 
          of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same 
          way in any country.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          He's right. It's dead easy. That's what the Bush regime banks on. The 
          distinction between election campaigns and war, between democracy and 
          oligarchy, seems to be closing fast. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          The only caveat in these campaign wars is that U.S. lives must not be 
          lost. It shakes voter confidence. But the problem of U.S. soldiers being 
          killed in combat has been licked. More or less.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          At a media briefing before Operation Shock and Awe was unleashed, General 
          Tommy Franks announced, &quot;This campaign will be like no other in 
          history.&quot; Maybe he's right. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          I'm no military historian, but when was the last time a war was fought 
          like this? </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          After using the &quot;good offices&quot; of UN diplomacy (economic sanctions 
          and weapons inspections) to ensure that Iraq was brought to its knees, 
          its people starved, half a million children dead, its infrastructure 
          severely damaged, <i>after making sure that most of its weapons had 
          been destroyed</i>, in an act of cowardice that must surely be unrivalled 
          in history, the &quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot; (better known as 
          the Coalition of the Bullied and Bought) - sent in an invading army!

          Operation Iraqi Freedom? I don't think so. It was more like Operation

          As soon as the war began, the governments of France, Germany, and Russia, 
          which refused to allow a final resolution legitimizing the war to be 
          passed in the UN Security Council, fell over each other to say how much 
          they wanted the United States to win. President Jacques Chirac offered 
          French airspace to the Anglo-American air force. U.S. military bases 
          in Germany were open for business. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer 
          publicly hoped for the &quot;rapid collapse&quot; of the Saddam Hussein 
          regime. Vladimir Putin publicly hoped for the same. These are governments 
          that colluded in the enforced disarming of Iraq before their dastardly 
          rush to take the side of those who attacked it. Apart from hoping to 
          share the spoils, they hoped Empire would honor their pre-war oil contracts 
          with Iraq. Only the very na&iuml;ve could expect old Imperialists to 
          behave otherwise.</font>

          Leaving aside the cheap thrills and the lofty moral speeches made in 
          the UN during the run up to the war, eventually, at the moment of crisis, 
          the unity of Western governments - despite the opposition from the majority 
          of their people - was overwhelming.</font>

          When the Turkish government temporarily bowed to the views of 90 percent 
          of its population, and turned down the U.S. government's offer of billions 
          of dollars of blood money for the use of Turkish soil, it was accused 
          of lacking &quot;democratic principles.&quot; According to a Gallup 
          International poll, in no European country was support for a war carried 
          out &quot;unilaterally by America and its allies&quot; higher than 11 
          percent. But the governments of England, Italy, Spain, Hungary, and 
          other countries of Eastern Europe were praised for disregarding the 
          views of the majority of their people and supporting the illegal invasion. 
          That, presumably, was fully in keeping with democratic principles. What's 
          it called? New Democracy? (Like Britain's New Labour?)</font>

          In stark contrast to the venality displayed by their governments, on

          display of public morality the world has ever seen, more than 10 million 
          people marched against the war on 5 continents. Many of you, I'm sure, 
          were among them. They - we - were disregarded with utter disdain. When 
          asked to react to the anti-war demonstrations, President Bush said, 
          &quot;It's like deciding, well, I'm going to decide policy based upon 
          a focus group. The role of a leader is to decide policy based upon the 
          security, in this case the security of the people.&quot;</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Democracy, the modern world's 
          holy cow, is in crisis. And the crisis is a profound one. Every kind 
          of outrage is being committed in the name of democracy. It has become 
          little more than a hollow word, a pretty shell, emptied of all content 
          or meaning. It can be whatever you want it to be. Democracy is the Free 
          World's whore, willing to dress up, dress down, willing to satisfy a 
          whole range of taste, available to be used and abused at will. 
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Until quite recently, right up to the 1980's, democracy did seem as

          justice. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          But modern democracies have been around for long enough for neo-liberal 
          capitalists to learn how to subvert them. They have mastered the technique 
          of infiltrating the instruments of democracy - the &quot;independent&quot; 
          judiciary, the &quot;free&quot; press, the parliament - and molding 
          them to their purpose. The project of corporate globalization has cracked 
          the code. Free elections, a free press, and an independent judiciary 
          mean little when the free market has reduced them to commodities on 
          sale to the highest bidder.</font>

          To fully comprehend the extent to which Democracy is under siege, it 
          might be an idea to look at what goes on in some of our contemporary 
          democracies. The World's Largest: India, (which I have written about 
          at some length and therefore will not speak about tonight). The World's 
          Most Interesting: South Africa. The world's most powerful: the U.S.A. 
          And, most instructive of all, the plans that are being made to usher 
          in the world's newest: Iraq.</font>

          In South Africa, after 300 years of brutal domination of the black majority 
          by a white minority through colonialism and apartheid, a non-racial, 
          multi-party democracy came to power in 1994. It was a phenomenal achievement. 
          Within two years of coming to power, the African National Congress had 
          genuflected with no caveats to the Market God. Its massive program of 
          structural adjustment, privatization, and liberalization has only increased 
          the hideous disparities between the rich and the poor. More than a million 
          people have lost their jobs. The corporatization of basic services - 
          electricity, water, and housing-has meant that 10 million South Africans, 
          almost a quarter of the population, have been disconnected from water 
          and electricity. 2 million have been evicted from their homes.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Meanwhile, a small white minority that has been historically privileged 
          by centuries of brutal exploitation is more secure than ever before. 
          They continue to control the land, the farms, the factories, and the 
          abundant natural resources of that country. For them the transition 
          from apartheid to neo-liberalism barely disturbed the grass. It's apartheid 
          with a clean conscience. And it goes by the name of Democracy.</font>

          In countries of the first world, too, the machinery of democracy has 
          been effectively subverted. Politicians, media barons, judges, powerful 
          corporate lobbies, and government officials are imbricated in an elaborate 
          underhand configuration that completely undermines the lateral arrangement 
          of checks and balances between the constitution, courts of law, parliament, 
          the administration and, perhaps most important of all, the independent 
          media that form the structural basis of a parliamentary democracy. Increasingly, 
          the imbrication is neither subtle nor elaborate. </font>

          Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, for instance, has a controlling

          about 90 percent of Italy's TV viewership. Recently, during a trial 
          on bribery charges, while insisting he was the only person who could 
          save Italy from the left, he said, &quot;How much longer do I have to

          Channel organized pro-war patriotic &quot;Rallies for America&quot; 
          across the country. It used its radio stations to advertise the events 
          and then sent correspondents to cover them as though they were breaking 
          news. The era of manufacturing consent has given way to the era of manufacturing

          In the three years of George Bush the Lesser's term, the American economy 
          has lost more than two million jobs. Outlandish military expenses, corporate 
          welfare, and tax giveaways to the rich have created a financial crisis 
          for the U.S. educational system. According to a survey by the National 
          Council of State Legislatures, U.S. states cut 49 billion dollars in 
          public services, health, welfare benefits, and education in 2002. They 
          plan to cut another 25.7 billion dollars this year. That makes a total 
          of 75 billion dollars. Bush's initial budget request to Congress to 
          finance the war in Iraq was 80 billion dollars. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          So who's paying for the war? America's poor. Its students, its unemployed, 
          its single mothers, its hospital and home-care patients, its teachers, 
          and health workers.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          And who's actually fighting the war?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Once again, America's poor. The soldiers who are baking in Iraq's desert 
          sun are not the children of the rich. Only one of all the representatives 
          in the House of Representatives and the Senate has a child fighting 
          in Iraq. America's &quot;volunteer&quot; army in fact depends on a poverty 
          draft of poor whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians looking for a way 
          to earn a living and get an education. Federal statistics show that 
          African Americans make up 21 percent of the total armed forces and 29 
          percent of the U.S. army. They count for only 12 percent of the general 
          population. It's ironic, isn't it - the disproportionately high representation 
          of African Americans in the army and prison? Perhaps we should take 
          a positive view, and look at this as affirmative action at its most 
          effective. Nearly 4 million Americans (2 percent of the population) 
          have lost the right to vote because of felony convictions. Of that number, 
          1.4 million are African Americans, which means that 13 percent of all 
          voting-age Black people have been disenfranchised. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          For African Americans there's also affirmative action in death. A study 
          by the economist Amartya Sen shows that African Americans as a group 
          have a lower life expectancy than people born in China, in the Indian 
          State of Kerala (where I come from), Sri Lanka, or Costa Rica. Bangladeshi

          This year, on what would have been Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 74th

          &quot;unfair,&quot; and &quot;unconstitutional.&quot; The successful 
          effort to keep Blacks off the voting rolls in the State of Florida in 
          order that George Bush be elected was of course neither unfair nor unconstitutional.

          of a conflict of interest, he said, &quot;I don't know that Bechtel

          We might as well accept the fact that there is no conventional military 
          force that can successfully challenge the American war machine. Terrorist

          The U.S. government has already displayed in no uncertain terms the 
          range and extent of its capability for paranoid aggression. In human 
          psychology, paranoid aggression is usually an indicator of nervous insecurity. 
          It could be argued that it's no different in the case of the psychology 
          of nations. Empire is paranoid because it has a soft underbelly. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Its &quot;homeland&quot; may be defended by border patrols and nuclear 
          weapons, but its economy is strung out across the globe. Its economic 
          outposts are exposed and vulnerable. Already the Internet is buzzing 
          with elaborate lists of American and British government products and 
          companies that should be boycotted. Apart from the usual targets - Coke, 
          Pepsi, McDonalds - government agencies like USAID, the British DFID, 
          British and American banks, Arthur Andersen, Merrill Lynch, and American 
          Express could find themselves under siege. These lists are being honed 
          and refined by activists across the world. They could become a practical 
          guide that directs the amorphous but growing fury in the world. Suddenly, 
          the &quot;inevitability&quot; of the project of Corporate Globalization 
          is beginning to seem more than a little evitable.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          It would be na&iuml;ve to imagine that we can directly confront Empire. 
          Our strategy must be to isolate Empire's working parts and disable them 
          one by one. No target is too small. No victory too insignificant. We 
          could reverse the idea of the economic sanctions imposed on poor countries 
          by Empire and its Allies. We could impose a regime of Peoples' Sanctions 
          on every corporate house that has been awarded with a contract in postwar 
          Iraq, just as activists in this country and around the world targeted 
          institutions of apartheid. Each one of them should be named, exposed, 
          and boycotted. Forced out of business. That could be our response to 
          the Shock and Awe campaign. It would be a great beginning.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Another urgent challenge is to expose the corporate media for the boardroom 
          bulletin that it really is. We need to create a universe of alternative 
          information. We need to support independent media like Democracy Now!, 
          Alternative Radio, and South End Press.</font>

          The battle to reclaim democracy is going to be a difficult one. Our 
          freedoms were not granted to us by any governments. They were wrested 
          from them by us. And once we surrender them, the battle to retrieve 
          them is called a revolution. It is a battle that must range across continents 
          and countries. It must not acknowledge national boundaries but, if it 
          is to succeed, it has to begin here. In America. The only institution 
          more powerful than the U.S. government is American civil society. The 
          rest of us are subjects of slave nations. We are by no means powerless, 
          but you have the power of proximity. You have access to the Imperial 
          Palace and the Emperor's chambers. Empire's conquests are being carried 
          out in your name, and you have the right to refuse. You could refuse 
          to fight. Refuse to move those missiles from the warehouse to the dock. 
          Refuse to wave that flag. Refuse the victory parade.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          You have a rich tradition of resistance. You need only read Howard Zinn's 
          <i>A People's History of the United States</i> to remind yourself of 
          this.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          Hundreds of thousands of you have survived the relentless propaganda 
          you have been subjected to, and are actively fighting your own government. 
          In the ultra-patriotic climate that prevails in the United States, that's 
          as brave as any Iraqi or Afghan or Palestinian fighting for his or her 
          homeland. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          If you join the battle, not in your hundreds of thousands, but in your 
          millions, you will be greeted joyously by the rest of the world. And 
          you will see how beautiful it is to be gentle instead of brutal, safe 
          instead of scared. Befriended instead of isolated. Loved instead of 
          hated.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          I hate to disagree with your president. Yours is by no means a great 
          nation. But you could be a great people. </font>

          History is giving you the chance. </font>
