<p>MANY OF US will never forget when the people of the world welcomed the 
dawn of the new millennium. As the Earth turned, we watched televised pictures 
of people celebrating and cheering as the sky lit up with fireworks -- from 
Asia to Europe, from Africa to North America. And, for the first time in human 
history, we understood, in a deeply visceral way, that we really do inhabit 
the same planet and that we are, in fact, members of a global society.
<P>That is what's going to happen again on Saturday. In 316 cities in 60 
countries -- Cairo, Bangkok, Beirut, Jakarta, Prague, Budapest, Tokyo, Moscow, 
London, Cape Town, Kigali in Rwanda, Madrid, Warsaw, Kiev, Lisbon, Mexico City,
<P>Sao Paulo, New York, Sydney, Barcelona, to name but a few -- more than a 
million people are expected to march and rally against an American invasion of 
Iraq. Even McMurdo Station in Antarctica will hold a protest against the war. 
Such a global outpouring against the threat of war is unprecedented.
<P>Without the Internet, of course, such a global protest would be 
unimaginable. But the Internet is only the messenger. Clearly, there is strong 
opposition here and abroad to an American invasion of Iraq.
<P>What's truly surprising are the concise slogans posted on the Web sites of 
the coalitions that have helped organize this protest. No America bashing. No 
defense of Saddam Hussein. No solidarity with al Qaeda terrorists. In dozens 
of languages, the message is simple and direct: "No war in Iraq." "Stop the 
war in Iraq."
<P>People around the world now feel a right to express their opposition to war.
<P>They clearly believe Hussein is a ruthless dictator. But they also understand 
that the greatest threat is terrorist attacks from elusive networks that 
cannot be stopped by American bombs or U.N. weapons inspections.
<P>The Bush administration, of course, will try to discredit this global 
uprising against an American war with Iraq. But it won't be so easy. The 
coalitions assembled in these cities include business, labor and religious 
groups; veterans of former wars, environmentalists, human rights activists and 
mothers against war; and thousands of ordinary people who are asking the U.N. 
Security Council to pursue further weapons inspections in Iraq, not war.
<P>The next day will be our turn to march. In deference to the celebration of 
the Chinese New Year, San Francisco will hold its anti-war march on Sunday, 
Feb. 16. Once again, as thousands did last month, people will assemble at 11 a.
m. at Justin Herman Plaza at the Embarcadero. They will then march up Market 
Street for a 2 p.m. closing rally in Civic Center. Once again, ordinary people 
will give up a precious weekend day to make their voice heard -- peacefully.
<P>Expect a tiny band of adolescent anarchists, who would rather spray 
graffiti and smash windows than join others in a peaceful march. We should 
condemn such antics. There is nothing less persuasive than using violence in 
the name of preventing war.
<P>Why, you may ask, should you participate in this demonstration? Because you 
are a citizen of a great nation that is violating its own democratic ideals, 
treating the rest of the world with dismissive contempt and refusing to be 
restrained by international law.
<P>Because you are a citizen of a new global society. Globalization is about 
more than free trade. What we are witnessing is the birth of a grassroots 
global democracy. To emphasize our membership in this new global society, many 
protesters around the world will be carrying the U.N. flag, a fitting symbol 
for a new era.
<P>When people ask, as they eventually will, who stood up for human rights, 
let your name be among those who opposed an unjust and unnecessary war.
