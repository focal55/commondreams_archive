<p>I am finally ready to admit what for months I have kept hidden: I am 

terrified.

<p>I am more scared than I have ever been in my adult life. For weeks now I

have felt a new kind of free-floating terror at what has been unfolding, as 

the Bush administration has made it clear that nothing would derail its mad 

rush to war.

<p>Until now, I have not spoken of it. In organizing meetings or talks to 

community groups or rally speeches, I held back. The task was to build the 

antiwar movement, and I worried that talking too much about my fear might 

undermine that. People need to feel empowered, hopeful, I told myself; we 

should be talking about the potential of the movement.



<p>That hasn't changed. We have to continue to build the movement, which has 

enormous potential over the long-term to turn this society away from war

and profit, toward peace and the needs of people. We cannot abandon our 

commitment to the people of the world, the work of education and organizing 

that we all must do if we are to make good on that commitment.



<p>But I no longer think we can build such a movement by suppressing or 

keeping quiet about this fear we feel. In the past few weeks I have seen

this fear so clearly in the eyes of my friends, heard it in the nervous 

comments of strangers, and been surprised by it in the unease with which

even many supporters of the war talked.



<p>I knew it when this past weekend my father -- a conservative, Republican

small-town businessman and World War II-era veteran -- tried to convince me 

that Bush wouldn't really start a war, that he was bluffing, just being 

cagey. Even my father was scared of the plans of the man he voted for.



<p>I think people all over the world whose capacity to feel has not been 

occluded by power or hate are feeling something like this. It is not a fear 

of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction or even necessarily of this

particular war, as frightening as all those things may be. I believe it is 

a fear of something more difficult to pin down, a fear of the forces that 

will be unleashed when the United States defies the world and launches a

war that -- while couched in talk of protecting people from threats -- is 

so obviously about projecting U.S. power to achieve a kind of world 

domination that was never possible before.



<p>Bush and his advisers proudly announce that they have cast aside any 

commitment to collective security, real diplomacy, and international law. 

Will the United Nations survive? Will there be anything left of an 

international system when Bush and his gang are finished? Will there be any 

hope for the peaceful settlement of disputes? Of course none of these 

concepts has ever been fully implemented, and we all know that the 

international institutions have flaws. But will anyone feel safer in a 

world in which the law comes only from the blade of the American sword, 

permanently drawn?



<p>This fear I feel is not just of power-run-amok but of an empire with the

most destructive military capacity that has ever existed -- an empire with 

thermobaric bombs and cruise missiles, cluster bombs and nuclear "bunker

busters." No matter how hard the government works to try to keep us from

seeing the results of those weapons -- and no matter how much the news 

media cooperate in that project -- we understand how many civilians could 

die under the onslaught of these horrific weapons. They can censor the 

pictures, but not our imaginations.

<p>This fear I feel is not just of the unchecked power of the United States

but of the fact that Bush and his advisers seem to think they understand

their own power and can control it. It is the arrogance of virtually 

unlimited power married to lifelong privilege. It is hubris, and in a 

nuclear world there is no sin that is potentially more deadly.

<p>This is the fear that I feel, that I think so many of us feel. The Bush 

administration wants us to be afraid, but remain quiet about it. Our power 

will come not from denying the fear but in confronting, and overcoming, it. 

So, we must speak of it, not to scare others but to bring us closer 

together. Our only hope against the fear is in each other, in our 

organizing, in our resistance. And if we can confront our fears, we can 

confront this empire.

<p>If you feel this fear and aren't sure that, in the face of it, you can 

remain involved -- or get involved for the first time -- in the antiwar 

movement, all I can say is, "Where else will you go?" If we retreat into

our private spaces, thinking we can hide, we will find out quickly that 

this fear will follow us everywhere.

<p>Our only way out is together, in public, facing not only our fears but the 

fears that others will project onto us, and inviting them to join us. It

will be painful. It will carry with it certain risks. But it is the only

way we can hang onto our own humanity.

<p>I am scared, and I need help. We all do. Let us pledge not to let each 

other down -- for our own sake, and for the sake of the world.
