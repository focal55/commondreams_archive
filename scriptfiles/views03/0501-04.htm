<p>George W. Bush, properly understood, represents the third and most
powerful wave in the right's long-running assault on the governing order
created by twentieth-century liberalism. The first wave was Ronald
Reagan, whose election in 1980 allowed movement conservatives finally to
attain governing power (their flame was first lit by Barry Goldwater
back in 1964). Reagan unfurled many bold ideological banners for
right-wing reform and established the political viability of enacting
regressive tax cuts, but he accomplished very little reordering of
government, much less shrinking of it. The second wave was Newt
Gingrich, whose capture of the House majority in 1994 gave Republicans
control of Congress for the first time in two generations. Despite some
landmark victories like welfare reform, Gingrich flamed out quickly, a
zealous revolutionary ineffective as legislative leader.</p>
<p>

George Bush II may be as shallow as he appears, but his presidency
represents a far more formidable challenge than either Reagan or
Gingrich. His potential does not emanate from an amiable personality (Al
Gore, remember, outpolled him in 2000) or even the sky-high ratings
generated by 9/11 and war. Bush's governing strength is anchored in the
long, hard-driving movement of the right that now owns all three
branches of the federal government. Its unified ranks allow him to
govern aggressively, despite slender GOP majorities in the House and
Senate and the public's general indifference to the right's domestic
program.</p>
<p>

The movement's grand ambition--one can no longer say grandiose--is to
roll back the twentieth century, quite literally. That is, defenestrate
the federal government and reduce its scale and powers to a level well
below what it was before the New Deal's centralization. With that
accomplished, movement conservatives envision a restored society in
which the prevailing values and power relationships resemble the America
that existed around 1900, when William McKinley was President. Governing
authority and resources are dispersed from Washington, returned to local
levels and also to individuals and private institutions, most notably
corporations and religious organizations. The primacy of private
property rights is re-established over the shared public priorities
expressed in government regulation. Above all, private wealth--both
enterprises and individuals with higher incomes--are permanently
insulated from the progressive claims of the graduated income tax.</p>
<p>

These broad objectives may sound reactionary and destructive (in
historical terms they are), but hard-right conservatives see themselves
as liberating reformers, not destroyers, who are rescuing old American
virtues of self-reliance and individual autonomy from the clutches of
collective action and "statist" left-wingers. They do not expect any of
these far-reaching goals to be fulfilled during Bush's tenure, but they
do assume that history is on their side and that the next wave will come
along soon (not an unreasonable expectation, given their great gains
during the past thirty years). Right-wingers--who once seemed frothy and
fratricidal--now understand that three steps forward, two steps back still adds up to
forward progress. It's a long march, they say. Stick together, because
we are winning.</p>
<p>

Many opponents and critics (myself included) have found the right's
historic vision so improbable that we tend to guffaw and misjudge the
political potency of what it has put together. We might ask ourselves:
If these ideas are so self-evidently cockeyed and reactionary, why do
they keep advancing? The right's unifying idea--get the government out
of our lives--has broad popular appeal, at least on a sentimental level,
because it represents an authentic core value in the American experience
("Don't tread on me" was a slogan in the Revolution). But the true
source of its strength is the movement's fluid architecture and
durability over time, not the passing personalities of
Reagan-Gingrich-Bush or even the big money from business. The movement
has a substantial base that believes in its ideological vision--people
alarmed by cultural change or injured in some way by government
intrusions, coupled with economic interests that have very strong
reasons to get government off their backs--and the right has created the
political mechanics that allow these disparate elements to pull
together. Cosmopolitan corporate executives hold their noses and go
along with Christian activists trying to stamp out "decadent" liberal
culture. Fed-up working-class conservatives support business's assaults
on their common enemy, liberal government, even though they may be
personally injured when business objectives triumph.</p>
<p>

The right's power also feeds off the general decay in the political
system--the widely shared and often justifiable resentments felt toward
big government, which no longer seems to address the common concerns of
ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>

I am not predicting that the right will win the governing majority that
could enact the whole program, in a kind of right-wing New Deal--and I
will get to some reasons why I expect their cause to fail eventually.
The farther they advance, however, the less inevitable is their failure.</p>




   <p class="tn5" icap="off">

<b>II. The McKinley Blueprint</b>
</p>
<p>

In the months after last November's elections, the Bush Administration
rattled progressive sensibilities with shock and awe on the home
front--a barrage of audacious policy initiatives: Allow churches to
include sanctuaries of worship in buildings financed by federal housing
grants. Slash hundreds of billions in domestic programs, especially
spending for the poor, even as the Bush tax cuts kick in for the
well-to-do. At the behest of Big Pharma, begin prosecuting those who
help the elderly buy cheaper prescription drugs in Canada. Compel the
District of Columbia to conduct federally financed school voucher
experiments (even though DC residents are overwhelmingly opposed).
Reform Medicaid by handing it over to state governments, which will be
free to make their own rules, much like welfare reform. Do the same for
housing aid, food stamps and other long-established programs. Redefine
"wetlands" and "wilderness" so that millions of protected acres are
opened for development.</p>
<p>

Liberal activists gasped at the variety and dangerous implications (the
public might have been upset too but was preoccupied with war), while
conservatives understood that Bush was laying the foundations, step by
step, toward their grand transformation of American life. These are the
concrete elements of their vision:</p>
<p>

&#167; Eliminate federal taxation of private capital, as the essential
predicate for dismantling the progressive income tax. This will require
a series of reform measures (one of them, repeal of the estate tax,
already accomplished). Bush has proposed several others: elimination of
the tax on stock dividends and establishment of new tax-sheltered
personal savings accounts for the growing "investor class." Congress
appears unwilling to swallow these, at least this year, but their
introduction advances the education-agitation process. Future revenue would be harvested from a single-rate
flat tax on wages or, better still, a stiff sales tax on consumption.
Either way, labor gets taxed, but not capital. The 2003 Economic Report
of the President, prepared by the Council of Economic Advisers, offers a
primer on the advantages of a consumption tax and how it might work.
Narrowing the tax base naturally encourages smaller government.</p>
<p>

&#167; Gradually phase out the pension-fund retirement system as we know
it, starting with Social Security privatization but moving eventually to
breaking up the other large pools of retirement savings, even huge
public-employee funds, and converting them into individualized accounts.
Individuals will be rewarded for taking personal responsibility for
their retirement with proposed "lifetime savings" accounts where capital
is stored, forever tax-exempt. Unlike IRAs, which provide a tax
deduction for contributions, wages are taxed upfront but permanently
tax-sheltered when deposited as "lifetime" capital savings, including
when the money is withdrawn and spent. Thus this new format inevitably
threatens the present system, in which employers get a tax deduction for
financing pension funds for their workers. The new alternative should
eventually lead to repeal of the corporate tax deduction and thus
relieve business enterprise of any incentive to finance pensions for
employees. Everyone takes care of himself.</p>
<p>

&#167; Withdraw the federal government from a direct role in housing,
healthcare, assistance to the poor and many other long-established
social priorities, first by dispersing program management to local and
state governments or private operators, then by steadily paring down the
federal government's financial commitment. If states choose to kill an
aid program rather than pay for it themselves, that confirms that the
program will not be missed. Any slack can be taken up by the private
sector, philanthropy and especially religious institutions that teach
social values grounded in faith.</p>
<p>

&#167; Restore churches, families and private education to a more
influential role in the nation's cultural life by giving them a
significant new base of income--public money. When "school choice"
tuitions are fully available to families, all taxpayers will be
compelled to help pay for private school systems, both secular and
religious, including Catholic parochial schools. As a result, public
schools will likely lose some of their financial support, but their
enrollments are expected to shrink anyway, as some families opt out.
Although the core of Bush's "faith-based initiative" stalled in
Congress, he is advancing it through new administrative rules. The
voucher strategy faces many political hurdles, but the Supreme Court is
out ahead, clearing away the constitutional objections.</p>
<p>

&#167; Strengthen the hand of business enterprise against burdensome
regulatory obligations, especially environmental protection, by
introducing voluntary goals and "market-driven" solutions. These will
locate the decision-making on how much progress is achievable within
corporate managements rather than enforcement agencies (an approach also
championed in this year's Economic Report). Down the road, when a more
aggressive right-wing majority is secured for the Supreme Court,
conservatives expect to throw a permanent collar around the regulatory
state by enshrining a radical new constitutional doctrine. It would
require government to compensate private property owners, including
businesses, for new regulations that impose costs on them or injure
their profitability, a formulation sure to guarantee far fewer
regulations [see Greider, "The Right and US Trade Law," October 15,
2001].</p>
<p>

&#167; Smash organized labor. Though unions have lost considerable
influence, they remain a major obstacle to achieving the right's vision.
Public-employee unions are formidable opponents on issues like
privatization and school vouchers. Even the declining industrial unions
still have the resources to mobilize a meaningful counterforce in
politics. Above all, the labor movement embodies the progressives'
instrument of power: collective action. The mobilizations of citizens in
behalf of broad social demands are inimical to the right's vision of
autonomous individuals, in charge of their own affairs and acting alone.
Unions may be taken down by a thousand small cuts, like stripping
"homeland security" workers of union protection. They will be more
gravely weakened if pension funds, an enduring locus of labor power, are
privatized.</p>
<p>

Looking back over this list, one sees many of the old peevish
conservative resentments--Social Security, the income tax, regulation of
business, labor unions, big government centralized in Washington--that
represent the great battles that conservatives lost during early decades
of the twentieth century. That is why the McKinley era represents a lost
Eden the right has set out to restore. Grover Norquist, president of
Americans for Tax Reform and a pivotal leader in the movement's
inside-outside politics, confirms this observation. "Yes, the McKinley
era, absent the protectionism," he agrees, is the goal. "You're looking
at the history of the country for the first 120 years, up until Teddy
Roosevelt, when the socialists took over. The income tax, the death tax,
regulation, all that." (In foreign policy, at least, the Bush
Administration could fairly be said to have already restored the spirit
of that earlier age. Justifying the annexation of the Philippines,
McKinley famously explained America's purpose in the world: "There was
nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the
Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God's
grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow men for whom
Christ also died.")</p>
<p>

But the right employs a highly selective memory. McKinley Republicans,
aligned with the newly emergent industrial titans, did indeed hold off
the Progressive advocates of a federal income tax and other reforms,
while its high tariffs were the equivalent of a stiff consumption tax.
And its conservative Supreme Court blocked regulatory laws designed to
protect society and workers as unconstitutional intrusions on private
property rights.</p>
<p>

But the truth is that McKinley's conservatism broke down not because of
socialists but because a deeply troubled nation was awash in social and
economic conflicts, inequities generated by industrialization and the
awesome power consolidating in the behemoth industrial corporations
(struggles not resolved until economic crisis spawned the New Deal).
Reacting to popular demands, Teddy Roosevelt enacted landmark
Progressive reforms like the first federal regulations protecting public
health and safety and a ban on corporate campaign contributions. Both
Roosevelt and his successor, Republican William Howard Taft, endorsed
the concept of a progressive income tax and other un-Republican measures
later enacted under Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p>

George W. Bush does not of course ever speak of the glories of the
McKinley era or acknowledge his party's retrograde objectives (Ari
Fleischer would bat down any suggestions to the contrary). Conservatives
learned, especially from Gingrich's implosion, to avoid flamboyant
ideological proclamations. Instead, the broader outlines are only hinted
at in various official texts. But there's nothing really secretive about
their intentions. Right-wing activists and think tanks have been openly
articulating the goals for years. Some of their ideas that once sounded
loopy are now law.</p>




   <p class="tn5" icap="off">

<b>III. The Ecumenical Right</b>
</p>
<p>

The movement "is moving with the speed of a glacier," explains Martin
Anderson, a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution who served as
Reagan's house intellectual, the keeper of the flame, and was among the
early academics counseling George W. Bush. "It moves very slowly, stops
sometimes, even retreats, but then it moves forward again. Sometimes, it
comes up against a tree and seems stuck, then the tree snaps and people
say, 'My gosh, it's a revolution.'" To continue the metaphor, Anderson
thinks this glacier will run up against some big boulders that do not
yield, that the right will eventually be stopped short of grand
objectives like small government or elimination of the income tax. But
they've made impressive progress so far.</p>
<p>

For the first time since the 1920s, Congress, the White House and the
Supreme Court are all singing from same hymnal and generally reinforcing
one another. The Court's right-wing majority acts to shrink federal
authority, block citizen challenges of important institutions and hack
away at the liberal precedents on civil rights, regulatory law and many
other matters (it even decides an election for its side, when
necessary).</p>
<p>

Bush, meanwhile, has what Reagan lacked--a Reaganite majority in
Congress. When the Gipper won in 1980, most Republicans in Congress were
still traditional conservatives, not radical reformers. The majority of
House Republicans tipped over to the Reaganite identity in 1984, a
majority of GOP senators not until 1994. The ranks of the
unconverted--Republicans who refuse to sign Norquist's pledge not to
raise taxes--are now, by his count, down to 5 percent in the House
caucus, 15 percent in the Senate.
</p>
<p>

This ideological solidarity is a central element in Bush's governing
strength. So long as he can manage the flow of issues in accord with the
big blueprint, the right doesn't shoot at him when he makes politically
sensitive deviations (import quotas for steel or the lavish new
farm-subsidy bill). It also helps that, especially in the House, the GOP
leaders impose Stalinist discipline on their troops. Bush also reassures
the far right by making it clear that he is one of them. Reagan used to
stroke the Christian right with strong rhetoric on social issues but
gave them very little else (the man was from Hollywood, after all). Bush
is a true believer, a devout Christian and exceedingly public about it.
Bush's principal innovation--a page taken from Bill Clinton's
playbook--is to confuse the opposition's issues by offering his own
compassion-lite alternatives, co-opting or smothering Democratic
initiatives. Unlike Clinton, Bush does not mollify his political base
with empty gestures. Their program is his program.
</p>
<p>

"Reagan talked a good game on the domestic side but he actually didn't
push for much," says Paul Weyrich, leader of the Free Congress
Foundation and a movement pioneer. "Likewise, the Gingrich era was a lot
of rhetoric. This Administration is far more serious and disciplined....
they have better outreach than any with which I have dealt. These people
have figured out how to communicate regularly with their base, make sure
it understands what they're doing. When they have to go against their
base, they know how to inoculate themselves against what might happen."
</p>
<p>

Norquist's ambition is that building on its current strength, the right
can cut government by half over the next twenty-five years to "get it
down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub" [see Robert
Dreyfuss, "Grover Norquist: 'Field Marshal' of the Bush Tax Plan," May
14, 2001]. The federal government would shrink from 20 percent of GDP to
10 percent, state and local government from 12 to 6 percent. When
vouchers become universally available, he expects public schools to
shrink from 6 to 3 percent of GDP. "And we'll have better schools," he
assures. People like Norquist play the role of constantly pushing the
boundaries of the possible. "I'm lining up support to abolish the
alternative minimum tax," he says. "Has Bush spoken to this? No. I want
to run ahead, put our guys on the record for it. So I will be out in
front of the Bush Administration, not attacking the Bush Administration.
Will he do everything we want? No, but you know what? I don't care."
</p>
<p>

Americans for Tax Reform serves as a kind of "action central" for a
galaxy of conservative interests, with support from corporate names like
Microsoft, Pfizer, AOL Time Warner, R.J. Reynolds and the liquor
industry. "The issue that brings people to politics is what they want
from government," Norquist explains. "All our people want to be left
alone by government. To be in this coalition, you only need to have your
foot in the circle on one issue. You don't need a <i>Weltanschauung</i>,
you don't have to agree with every other issue, so long as the coalition
is right on yours. That's why we don't have the expected war within the
center-right coalition. That's why we can win."
</p>
<p>

One of the right's political accomplishments is bringing together
diverse, once-hostile sectarians. "The Republican Party used to be based
in the Protestant mainline and aggressively kept its distance from other
religions," Norquist observes. "Now we've got observant Catholics, the
people who go to mass every Sunday, evangelical Christians, Mormons,
orthodox Jews, Muslims." How did it happen? "The secular left has
created an ecumenical right," he says. This new tolerance, including on
race, may represent meaningful social change, but of course the right
also still feeds on intolerance too, demonizing those whose values or
lifestyle or place of birth does not conform to their idea of
"American."
</p>
<p>

This tendency, Norquist acknowledges, is a vulnerability. The swelling
ranks of Latino and Asian immigrants could become a transforming force
in American politics, once these millions of new citizens become
confident enough to participate in election politics (just as European
immigrants became a vital force for liberal reform in the early
twentieth century). So Bush labors to change the party's anti-immigrant
profile (and had some success with Mexican-Americans in Texas).
</p>
<p>

Norquist prefers to focus on other demographic trends that he believes
insure the right's eventual triumph: As the children of the New Deal die
off, he asserts, they will be replaced by young "leave me alone"
conservatives. Anderson, the former Reagan adviser, is less certain.
"Most of the people like what government is doing," he observes. "So
long as it isn't overintrusive and so forth, they're happy with it."
</p>




   <p class="tn5" icap="off">

<b>IV. Show Me the Money</b>
</p>
<p>

Ideology may provide the unifying umbrella, but the real glue of this
movement is its iron rule for practical politics: Every measure it
enacts, every half-step it takes toward the grand vision, must deliver
concrete rewards to one constituency or another, often several--and
right now, not in the distant future. Usually the reward is money. There
is nothing unusual or illegitimate about that, but it sounds like raw
hypocrisy considering that the right devotes enormous energy to
denouncing "special-interest politics" on the left (schoolteachers,
labor unions, bureaucrats, Hollywood). The right's interest groups,
issue by issue, bring their muscle to the cause. Bush's "lifetime
savings" accounts constitute a vast new product line for the securities
industry, which is naturally enthused about marketing and managing these
accounts. The terms especially benefit the well-to-do, since a family of
four will be able to shelter up to $45,000 annually (that's more than
most families earn in a year). The White House has enlisted Fortune 500
companies to spread the good news to the investor class in their regular
mailings to shareholders.
</p>
<p>

Bush's "market-friendly" reforms for healthcare would reward two
business sectors that many consumers regard as the problem--drug
companies and HMOs. Big Pharma would get the best of all worlds: a
federal subsidy for prescription drug purchases by the elderly, but
without any limits on the prices. The insurance industry is invited to
set up a privatized version of Medicare that would compete with the
government-run system (assuming there are enough senior citizens willing
to take that risk). 
</p>
<p>

Some rewards are not about money. Bush has already provided a victory
for "pro-lifers" with the ban on late-term abortions. The
antiabortionists are realists now and no longer badger the GOP for a
constitutional amendment, but perhaps a future Supreme Court, top-heavy
with right-wing appointees, will deliver for them. Republicans are
spoiling for a fight over guns in 2004, when the federal ban on assault
rifles is due to expire. Liberals, they hope, will try to renew the law
so the GOP can deliver a visible election-year reward by blocking it.
(Gun-control advocates are thinking of forcing Bush to choose between
the gun lobby and public opinion.)
</p>
<p>

The biggest rewards, of course, are about taxation, and the internal
self-discipline is impressive. When Reagan proposed his huge tax-rate
cuts in 1981, the K Street corporate lobbyists piled on with their own
list of goodies and the White House lost control; Reagan's tax cuts
wound up much larger than he intended. This time around, business
behaved itself when Bush proposed a tax package in 2001 in which its
wish list was left out. "They supported the 2001 tax cuts because they
knew there was going to be another tax cut every year and, if you don't
support this year's, you go to the end of the line next time," Norquist
says. Their patience has already been rewarded. The antitax movement
follows a well-defined script for advancing step by step to the ultimate
goal. Norquist has organized five caucuses to agitate and sign up
Congressional supporters on five separate issues: estate-tax repeal
(already enacted but still vulnerable to reversal); retirement-savings
reforms; elimination of the alternative minimum tax; immediate business
deductions for capital investment expenses (instead of a multiyear
depreciation schedule); and zero taxation of capital gains. "If we do
all of these things, there is no tax on capital and we are very close to
a flat tax," Norquist exclaims.
</p>
<p>

The road ahead is far more difficult than he makes it sound, because
along the way a lot of people will discover that they are to be the
losers. In fact, the McKinley vision requires vast sectors of society to
pay dearly, and from their own pockets. Martin Anderson has worked
through the flat-tax arithmetic many times, and it always comes out a
political loser. "The conservatives all want to revolutionize the tax
system, frankly because they haven't thought it through," Anderson says.
"It means people from zero to $35,000 income pay no tax and anyone over
$150,000 is going to get a tax cut. The people in between get a tax
increase, unless you cut federal spending. That's not going to happen."
</p>
<p>

Likewise, any substantial consumption tax does severe injury to another
broad class of Americans--the elderly. They were already taxed when they
were young and earning and saving their money, but a new consumption tax
would now tax their money again as they spend it. Lawrence Lindsey,
Bush's former economic adviser, has advocated a consumption-based flat
tax that would probably require a rate of 21 percent on consumer
purchases (like a draconian sales tax). He concedes, "It would be
hitting the current generation of elderly twice. So it would be a hard
sell."
</p>
<p>

"School choice" is also essentially a money issue, though this fact has
been obscured by the years of Republican rhetoric demonizing the public
schools and their teachers. Under tuition vouchers, the redistribution
of income will flow from all taxpayers to the minority of American
families who send their children to private schools, religious and
secular. Those children are less than 10 percent of the 52 million
children enrolled in K-12. You wouldn't know it from reading about the
voucher debate, but the market share of private schools actually
declined slightly during the past decade. The Catholic parochial system
stands to gain the most from public financing, because its enrollment
has declined by half since the 1960s (to 2.6 million). Though there was
some growth during the 1990s, it was in the suburbs, not cities. Other
private schools, especially religious schools in the South, grew more
during the past decade (by about 400,000), but public schools expanded
far faster, by 6 million. The point is, the right's constituency for
"school choice" remains a small though fervent minority.
</p>
<p>

Conservatives have cleverly transformed the voucher question into an
issue of racial equality--arguing that they are the best way to liberate
impoverished black children from bad schools in slum surroundings. But
educational quality notwithstanding, it is not self-evident that private
schools, including the Catholic parochial system, are disposed to solve
the problem of minority education, since they are highly segregated
themselves. Catholic schools enroll only 2.5 percent of black students
nationwide and, more telling, only 3.8 percent of Hispanic children,
most of whom are Catholic. In the South hundreds of private schools
originated to escape integration and were supported at first by state
tuition grants (later ruled unconstitutional). "School choice," in
short, might very well finance greater racial separation--the choice of
whites to stick with their own kind--and at public expense.
</p>
<p>

The right's assault on environmental regulation has a similar profile.
Taking the lead are small landowners or Western farmers who make
appealing pleas to be left alone to enjoy their property and take care
of it conscientiously. Riding alongside are developers and major
industrial sectors (and polluters) eager to win the same rights, if not
from Congress then the Supreme Court. But there's one problem: The
overwhelming majority of Americans want stronger environmental standards
and more vigorous enforcement. 
</p>




   <p class="tn5" icap="off">

<b>V. Are They Right About America?</b>
</p>
<p>

"Leave me alone" is an appealing slogan, but the right regularly
violates its own guiding principle. The antiabortion folks intend to use
government power to force their own moral values on the private lives of
others. Free-market right-wingers fall silent when Bush and Congress
intrude to bail out airlines, insurance companies, banks--whatever
sector finds itself in desperate need. The hard-right conservatives are
downright enthusiastic when the Supreme Court and Bush's Justice
Department hack away at our civil liberties. The "school choice"
movement seeks not smaller government but a vast expansion of taxpayer
obligations. Maybe what the right is really seeking is not so much to be
left alone by government but to use government to reorganize society in
its own right-wing image. All in all, the right's agenda promises a
reordering that will drive the country toward greater separation and
segmentation of its many social elements--higher walls and more distance
for those who wish to protect themselves from messy diversity. The trend
of social disintegration, including the slow breakup of the broad middle
class, has been under way for several decades--fissures generated by
growing inequalities of status and well-being. The right proposes to
legitimize and encourage these deep social changes in the name of
greater autonomy. Dismantle the common assets of society, give people
back their tax money and let everyone fend for himself.
</p>
<p>

Is this the country Americans want for their grandchildren or
great-grandchildren? If one puts aside Republican nostalgia for
McKinley's gaslight era, it was actually a dark and troubled time for
many Americans and society as a whole, riven as it was by harsh economic
conflict and social neglect of everyday brutalities.
</p>
<p>

Autonomy can be lonely and chilly, as millions of Americans have learned
in recent years when the company canceled their pensions or the stock
market swallowed their savings or industrial interests destroyed their
surroundings. For most Americans, there is no redress without common
action, collective efforts based on mutual trust and shared
responsibilities. In other words, I do not believe that most Americans
want what the right wants. But I also think many cannot see the choices
clearly or grasp the long-term implications for the country.
</p>
<p>

This is a failure of left-liberal politics. Constructing an effective
response requires a politics that goes right at the ideology, translates
the meaning of Bush's governing agenda, lays out the implications for
society and argues unabashedly for a more positive, inclusive,
forward-looking vision. No need for scaremongering attacks; stick to the
well-known facts. Pose some big questions: Do Americans want to get rid
of the income tax altogether and its longstanding premise that the
affluent should pay higher rates than the humble? For that matter, do
Americans think capital incomes should be excused completely from
taxation while labor incomes are taxed more heavily, perhaps through a
stiff national sales tax? Do people want to give up on the concept of
the "common school"--one of America's distinctive achievements? Should
property rights be given precedence over human rights or society's need
to protect nature? The recent battles over Social Security privatization
are instructive: When the labor-left mounted a serious ideological
rebuttal, well documented in fact and reason, Republicans scurried away
from the issue (though they will doubtless try again).

To make this case convincing, however, the opposition must first have a
coherent vision of its own. The Democratic Party, alas, is accustomed to
playing defense and has become wary of "the vision thing," as Dubya's
father called it. Most elected Democrats, I think, now see their role as
managerial rather than big reform, and fear that even talking about
ideology will stick them with the right's demon label: "liberal." If a
new understanding of progressive purpose does get formed, one that
connects to social reality and describes a more promising future, the
vision will not originate in Washington but among those who see
realities up close and are struggling now to change things on the
ground. We are a very wealthy (and brutally powerful) nation, so why do
people experience so much stress and confinement in their lives, a sense
of loss and failure? The answers, I suggest, will lead to a new
formulation of what progressives want.

The first place to inquire is not the failures of government but the
malformed power relationships of American capitalism--the terms of
employment that reduce many workers to powerless digits, the closely
held decisions of finance capital that shape our society, the waste and
destruction embedded in our system of mass consumption and production.
The goal is, like the right's, to create greater self-fulfillment but as
broadly as possible. Self-reliance and individualism can be made
meaningful for all only by first reviving the power of collective
action.

My own conviction is that a lot of Americans are ready to take up these
questions and many others. Some are actually old questions--issues of
power that were not resolved in the great reform eras of the past. They
await a new generation bold enough to ask if our prosperous society is
really as free and satisfied as it claims to be. When conscientious
people find ideas and remedies that resonate with the real experiences
of Americans, then they will have their vision, and perhaps the true
answer to the right wing.</p>
