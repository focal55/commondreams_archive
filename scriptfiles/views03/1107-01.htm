<p>With a year to Election Day, Ralph Nader is quietly gearing up for his second 
serious bid for the presidency. Though he has been telling reporters that he won't 
make a decision about running until the end of the year, any day now he will announce 
the formation of a presidential exploratory committee, which will allow him to 
start raising money and hiring staff. A final decision to go ahead full throttle 
will probably wait until the winnowing of the Democratic primary field starts 
in February, as Nader genuinely likes progressive Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich 
and has been supporting his underdog presidential bid. 
<p>In a recent interview, 
Nader rejected any suggestion that a 2004 run would be hobbled by the legacy of 
2000, a startlingly stubborn assertion given how many people, including Democratic 
Party leaders, grassroots activists, labor and environmental honchos, and liberal 
pundits, blame him for costing Al Gore the election. He insists that voters he 
meets rarely raise the issue. In response, he tells people to read Jeffrey Toobin's 
Too Close to Call, which demonstrates in precise detail how Gore and his top advisers 
made a series of dumb and defeatist choices during the Florida recount showdown, 
spoiling their chances for a full and accurate vote tally. 
<p>With a combination 
of irritation and amusement, Nader has watched Howard Dean adopt the style, if 
not the substance, of his 2000 campaign, no doubt aware that a Dean nomination 
would seriously hamper his ability to gain traction next spring and summer. While 
he recognizes that many Dean supporters may well have been Naderites in 2000, 
he calls Dean a "middle of the road" Democrat too friendly to corporate demands, 
and dismisses progressive enthusiasm for Dean's candidacy with this metaphor: 
"Everybody is starved. If you have a garden and if it rains, you're not excited, 
but if you're in the desert and it rains, you're delirious. But you know what 
rain in the desert produces? A mirage." Repeating an old refrain, he says it doesn't 
even matter if Dean is for real: "He can't deliver--he can be George McGovern 
on steroids, but when he gets into the corporate prison called the White House, 
he can't deliver." 
<p>Given how Nader talks about the "corporate Democrats" and 
their failure to fight President Bush on everything from tax cuts and the Patriot 
Act to Enron and the Iraq war, the die seems cast for a rerun of his 2000 campaign--except 
for one critical wrinkle. This time, there's real opposition to his running coming 
from within the Green Party, and the prospect of an internal primary battle that 
may hinder or conceivably block Nader from receiving the party's nomination or 
push him into running as an independent. 
<p>"I don't think Ralph Nader should 
run again," says Elizabeth Horton Sheff, one of the party's slowly increasing 
number of African-American elected officials. Sheff, the majority leader of the 
Hartford, Connecticut, city council, adds, "Our message of grassroots inclusion 
did not get through with this candidate. His appeal is not broad enough to reach 
my community." (Indeed, Nader only got 1 percent of the African-American vote 
in 2000, compared with his 3 percent overall. Even in Democratic strongholds like 
Washington, DC, where Nader reached 5 percent, he only got one in one hundred 
black votes.) Arguing that Nader reaches mainly progressive and middle-class whites, 
Sheff insists that the party doesn't even need a presidential candidate, concluding, 
"We should run someone only if they have a proven track record appealing to a 
cross section of America." 
<p>Larry Barnett, a Green who is the former mayor of 
Sonoma, California, and a current member of its city council, calls any presidential 
bid "an ego-centered exercise in futility." He asserts that the party is making 
steady inroads in local electoral politics that can eventually sustain more serious 
campaigns for higher office. "In the meantime, wasting its time in races that 
are unwinnable only detracts from its message, its long-term goals and current 
accomplishments," he says. Art Goodtimes, a county commissioner in San Miguel, 
Colorado, who was elected as a Democrat in 1996, switched to Green in 1998 and 
won re-election with 69 percent of the vote in 2000, strongly agrees: "If we're 
serious about advancing a national candidate, we have to begin to win at the local 
levels in numbers far exceeding the mere 175 or so local officials currently calling 
themselves Green." 
<p>Other concerns are being raised by well-known Green activists 
who want the party to present a united front against Bush's re-election. At the 
party's national committee meeting in Washington this July, John Rensenbrink, 
one of its founders, spoke to me with pained intensity as he, to all effects, 
denounced Nader, whom he had vociferously backed in 2000, for toying with a 2004 
run. 
<p>"People...are very focused on stopping the right-wing cabal that has taken 
over the country. Therefore, the focus has to be on defeating Bush. Beyond that, 
the Green Party needs to project a sense of urgency around saving the country, 
saving the Constitution, saving the planet." Rensenbrink, the co-editor of Green 
Horizon Quarterly (www.green-horizon.org), a new and lively independent Green 
journal, added with a sigh, "There's a concern that we'll be deflected from that 
message because of the baggage Ralph Nader has from 2000. I doubt he can get over 
1 percent of the vote. He'll have to spend a lot of time dealing with the 'spoiler' 
question, unfairly, but that's where it is. I'd add to that that he doesn't want 
to be a Green, he runs with his coterie rather than party organizers, he doesn't 
involve local Green leaders and he doesn't get the racial issue. I fear if Nader 
runs, he'll drag down every other Green in this country. I love him, but this 
is sheer practical politics." 
<p>Harsh words, but they're matched by Robert McChesney, 
co-editor of Monthly Review, member of Nader's Citizen Works' Corporate Reform 
Commission, president of the professors' council of the US Campus Greens since 
2001 and a leading media democracy activist. "I don't think Ralph should run," 
he e-mailed me a few weeks ago. "It would be bad for him personally; I doubt he 
would get half the number of votes he got in 2000. And it would be bad for the 
Greens.... Core elements of progressive constituencies, exactly the groups that 
the Greens need to build upon, will revolt with open contempt--far worse than 
2000--to anything that helps keep Bush in office." McChesney concludes, "Running 
a presidential candidate in 2004 for the Greens is probably a quantum leap off 
a cliff. It is the Greens' Jonestown." 
<p>This dispute has been roiling Green 
Party ranks for some time [see Ronnie Dugger, "Ralph, Don't Run," December 2, 
2002]. In May, Rensenbrink and Tom Sevigny (then one of the party's five national 
co-chairs) circulated a memo proposing that the Greens run a vigorous, "home-grown" 
candidate for President, not Nader. This candidate would run with the intention 
of supporting the Democratic ticket if the race was very close, concentrating 
on "safe" states where Bush or a Democrat would be very likely to win and thus 
a Green effort would pose little risk of helping Bush. (Only seventeen states 
are generally considered to be "in play.") Greens would focus on a handful of 
Congressional races, with Nader running for Senate from Connecticut, his home 
state. 
<p>This proposal prompted a strong counterstatement circulated by Ben Manski, 
a youthful firebrand who was Nader's Midwest field coordinator in 2000 and has 
been a party co-chair since 2001. Manski's manifesto, titled "2004 in Perspective: 
Green & Growing," rapidly gained the endorsement of more than 160 party activists, 
including at least ten elected officials. It starts with a restatement of the 
party's hopes to effect the political transformation of America. Recalling the 
corporate free-trade inclinations of the Clinton/Gore years, bipartisan support 
for intervention and empire, and unaddressed issues like global warming, "Green 
& Growing" asserts that the party is ready to aim for and achieve "realistic" 
goals as a genuine opposition to both major parties. And the manifesto insists 
that the 2004 presidential race "is vital for the Greens": 
<p>It's the race which 
deals directly with national policy, and which defines for the voters the Greens 
as a real party.... A strong Green presidential ticket will provide voters with 
the means to confront the establishment parties for their disastrous economic, 
international, ecological, and social policies. A strong Green ticket will force 
the establishment to address the failures of the electoral system, and to choose 
between the implementation of reforms such as Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), and 
the continued loss of votes to the Greens. A strong Green ticket will bring nonvoters 
into the arena of electoral politics, and thus strengthen the overall movement 
for democracy in the United States. 
<p>Dean Myerson, until October the Greens' 
national political coordinator and thus formally neutral in such arguments, disagrees--and, 
indeed, believes 2004 is the "most dangerous year" in the party's existence. "The 
best strategy to build the party," Myerson tells me, "is to not focus on states 
where we'll do poorly. Why should we hook ourselves to the Democrats' strategy 
and campaign against them? We should campaign in nonbattleground states and safe 
states. In medium-sized cities Nader will be on the front page--he'll actually 
get to talk about his issues and keep the focus there, not on his being a 'spoiler.'" 
Myerson insists that this is the year the party has to demonstrate its political 
maturity. "Many people just say to me, look at how the party grew in 2000; that's 
why we need to run again in '04. And I say, 'Lots of parties run presidential 
candidates and it doesn't help them grow.'" 
<p>Right now, the Green debate over 
2004 breaks into three distinct camps. There are those, a definite minority, who 
don't want the party to run any presidential candidate at all. There is another 
group, also a distinct minority, that backs Nader as the party's best spokesman 
and wants him to run an unconditional national campaign, though their motivations 
run from hard-core oppositionism to wanting to maximize their leverage in the 
event the race is close. The third group wants some version of a "safe states" 
strategy, and holds all shades of opinion as to whether Nader is the best candidate 
for it. 
<p>Ross Mirkarimi, an investigator in the San Francisco district attorney's 
office, who ran Nader's 2000 California operation and has often functioned as 
the state party's media spokesperson, has perhaps the most nuanced view. "We can 
devise a campaign plan that can contribute to the unseating of Bush while building 
the Green Party," he argues, noting that "we may be shopping for popular votes 
while the Democrats are shopping for electoral votes." Choosing his words slowly, 
he insists, "Democrats need to drive carefully as to where Greens may go, and 
the Greens need to do the same thing. A mechanism may be needed, whether it's 
over the table or covert, a sort of red phone to avoid danger and exercise diplomacy" 
[see "The Democrat-Green Death Struggle," opposite]. Is Nader capable of playing 
such a flexible role? "Ralph alone is not capable of acting in this manner," Mirkarimi 
says. "Ralph and a team and the party together are capable of devising such a 
strategy." Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Global Exchange and the Greens' 2000 
candidate for US Senate in California, agrees that it's hard to see Nader calibrating 
his message and strategy in this way on his own. "I worry about the reputation 
of the Greens," she told me. "I think we'd get less votes with Nader this time 
than last time." Benjamin wants the Greens to be players in the presidential election, 
but only if the overarching goal is beating Bush. 
<p>The problem is that the Greens 
have no formal way to compel Nader to do anything he doesn't want to do. The party 
had little influence on his 2000 campaign strategy and hiring practices, a sore 
spot for many veteran Greens. Despite numerous requests, he never gave the national 
party his 2000 campaign donor list, claiming--incorrectly--that federal law prohibited 
such a contribution to the party. He only rented the list to the party three years 
after his run, when it was undoubtedly far less valuable. (In his defense, Nader 
always mentions the more than forty-four fundraisers he has attended on behalf 
of Green Party committees and candidates.) 
<p>But politics abhors a vacuum, and 
among the Greens this debate is generating support for an insurgent named David 
Cobb, the party's general counsel and a hardworking activist who helped found 
the Texas Green Party in 1999. On the issues, there is little to distinguish Cobb 
from Nader--indeed, he dates his own political awakening to a speech Nader gave 
in 1996. But in launching his admittedly longshot attempt to get the party's presidential 
nod, Cobb has made a series of pledges that stand as an implicit rebuke and challenge 
to Nader--promising to share his volunteer lists with local and state party chapters, 
to freely share his donor lists with the party's national committee and to coordinate 
his hiring of staff with party affiliates. He has also stated that he will withdraw 
from the race if either Dennis Kucinich or Al Sharpton is the Democratic nominee, 
that he will run hard to prevent the election of a "corporate conservative" like 
Joe Lieberman and that otherwise he will follow a "strategic-states plan" focusing 
on states that are not "in play." 
<p>Asked in early October about Cobb's candidacy, 
Nader's first response is that he won't have anything to say before he makes his 
own 2004 decision. But after I describe Cobb's positions on Kucinich, Sharpton, 
Lieberman and "strategic states," he scoffs. "It sounds to me like political schizophrenia. 
You either run or you don't. You don't say to people in some states that we're 
going to ignore you." He also argues that the party shouldn't impose any kind 
of strategic constraints on its candidates. "No candidate will want to be bound 
by [having to avoid battleground states] and be told by the party that we don't 
want you to go into, say, Wisconsin. Imagine the major parties having that kind 
of restriction." Told that the Greens will defer any such decision until the party's 
national convention next June in Milwaukee, Nader says, "This shouldn't be delayed 
until June. They're not being fair to their candidates. They should have a meeting 
and come out with a policy." Almost as an afterthought he adds, "Assuming they 
can enforce it on their candidates." Nader has not ruled out leaving the Green 
fold and running as an independent. Nor is it inconceivable that he would file 
against Bush in some Republican primaries, and then try to switch to an independent 
line for the fall. 
<p>"The top priority should be to defeat Bush," Nader insists. 
"Obviously, the Democrats are having trouble showing how they can do that." With 
palpable frustration, he cites the Democrats' failure to make more headway from 
the corporate scandals and their timidity in the face of Republican appeals to 
war fever and patriotism. Growing more animated, he declares, "The real issue 
for Democrats beating up on the Greens is, can the Democrats win without a third-party 
effort to launch the issues that the Democrats are too dense or cautious or too 
indentured to raise themselves, which they'll then pick up?" Arguing that some 
kinds of poison can make a body stronger, he insists, with a touch of his own 
schizophrenia, that a third-party push could cause the Democrats "to say and do 
things that would get them more votes than they would lose to the third-party 
candidate." 
<p>If Nader and the Greens sound like they're contradicting themselves, 
it's because they're trying to bridge two conflicting goals: the long-term need 
for an independent political force and the short-term imperative of defeating 
Bush. In my opinion, 2004 is not 2000 and the "Gush-Bore" similarities I once 
wrote about don't apply now. I love Ralph and respect his legendary accomplishments 
and example, but another Nader run as a Green or independent without an explicit 
and binding agreement to concentrate on safe states would be a terrible mistake. 
Apart from risking the re-election of Bush, it would only hurt Nader. Barring 
an unforeseen shift in the contours of next year's election, he would do far worse 
than the 2.7 million votes he got in 2000. This is not his year. 
<p>As for the 
Greens, as long as the two-party duopoly misrules America, third-party efforts 
will percolate and independent voters will proliferate. But that doesn't mean 
that a particular party like the Greens is fated to have a long life beyond the 
margins. If the party is to grow outside of the progressive venues where it already 
has a foothold, it has to control its strong taste for self-indulgent symbolic 
statements and focus on where its opportunities are greatest, in local races in 
the one-party cities and counties where many of America's most alienated and disenfranchised 
citizens live. Nader and the Greens made their point about Democratic decrepitude 
in 2000; now they should make their own demonstration of good judgment or face 
their own decline.
