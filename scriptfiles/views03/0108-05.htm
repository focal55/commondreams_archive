<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; And with that, I'm more than happy to take your questions.  Helen.



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; At the earlier briefing, Ari, you said that the President

deplored the taking of innocent lives.  Does that apply to all innocent

lives in the world?  And I have a follow-up.

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; I refer specifically to a horrible terrorist attack

on Tel Aviv that killed scores and wounded hundreds.  And the

President, as he said in his statement yesterday, deplores in the

strongest terms the taking of those lives and the wounding of those

people, innocents in Israel.

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; My follow-up is, why does he want to drop bombs on innocent

Iraqis?

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; Helen, the question is how to protect Americans,

and our allies and friends  --

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; They're not attacking you.

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; --  from a country  --

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; Have they laid the glove on you or on the United States, the

Iraqis, in 11 years?

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; I guess you have forgotten about the Americans who

were killed in the first Gulf War as a result of Saddam Hussein's

aggression then.

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; Is this revenge, 11 years of revenge?

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; Helen, I think you know very well that the

President's position is that he wants to avert war, and that the

President has asked the United Nations to go into Iraq to help with the

purpose of averting war.

<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; Would the President attack innocent Iraqi lives?



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; The President wants to make certain that he can

defend our country, defend our interests, defend the region, and make

certain that American lives are not lost.



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; And he thinks they are a threat to us?



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; There is no question that the President thinks that

Iraq is a threat to the United States.



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; The Iraqi people?



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; The Iraqi people are represented by their

government.  If there was regime change, the Iraqi  --



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; So they will be vulnerable?



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; Actually, the President has made it very clear that

he has not dispute with the people of Iraq.  That's why the American

policy remains a policy of regime change.  There is no question the

people of Iraq --



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; That's a decision for them to make, isn't it?  It's their

country.



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Ari Fleischer: </b></font>&nbsp; Helen, if you think that the people of Iraq are in

a position to dictate who their dictator is, I don't think that has

been what history has shown.



<p><font color="#000099"><b>Helen Thomas: </b></font>&nbsp; I think many countries don't have  --  people don't have the

decision  --  including us.</p>
