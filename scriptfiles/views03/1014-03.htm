<p>More than 300,000 Americans, conservatively estimated, are behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses related to personal use.

<p>Rush Limbaugh isn't likely to become one of them.

<p>Even if Limbaugh is found to have broken the law by purchasing thousands of prescription painkillers, he has about as much chance of going to prison as I have of going to the moon.

<p>It's a blatant example of injustice -- not because Limbaugh should go to prison, but because hundreds of thousands of nonviolent drug offenders who did go, shouldn't have.

<p>Yet one wonders if Limbaugh's personal crisis will translate into a new sense of compassion for those who weren't fortunate to be rich, white celebrities who can afford to enroll in private drug treatment clinics accompanied by the prayers and support of millions of fans.

<p>Will Limbaugh's 20 million ''dittoheads'' -- the loyal followers of his syndicated radio show -- begin to see the value of public funding for drug treatment and rehabilitation programs, which studies indicate is a more effective strategy than incarceration for straightening out lives, at a third of the cost?

<p>Will they gain new insight that even good conservatives known for deriding liberals for coddling criminals and discouraging personal responsibility, may find themselves in need of a break and a little understanding themselves?

<p>Not likely. The ethical and moral standards we Americans love to tout are anything but consistent -- in fact, they can be wildly arbitrary, often changing 180 degrees depending on the circumstances and the individuals involved.

<p>Limbaugh's fans won't angrily demand that people like him do the time for doing the crime, no excuses. More likely, they'll point out a million reasons why he should be considered a good man who needs help -- which would be fine, if only they would offer the same sympathy to the unheralded thousands of others who are so easily stereotyped and forgotten.

<p>America's ethical inconsistencies go beyond drug policy.

<p>How about sexual morality? Just five years ago, millions of Americans piously argued that the president was a terrible example to youth and should be impeached for fibbing about his extramarital fling with a consenting adult partner.

<p>Now, Californians have elected as governor a married man who admits to having ''playfully'' groped and pawed women -- which legally qualifies as sexual battery -- for the better part of 30 years.

<p>What changed? For one thing, the Clinton sex scandals of the 1990s occurred during a time of plenty. The economy was booming. Consumers were buying; workers were working. Even average folks were day-trading for profits in the stock market. We could afford to nitpick about morality.

<p>Today, with 3.3 million Americans having lost their jobs since 2001 and state budgets gasping for solvency, we have more pressing matters than Arnold Schwarzenegger's definition of playfulness. We also have displayed shifting morality regarding war.

<p>Many Americans in 1992 and 1994 reacted with outrage at the thought of risking a single American soldier's life in Somalia and Haiti, even if it meant alleviating ongoing human rights atrocities in those countries.

<p>Many of those same Americans had no trouble with sending a quarter million troops to war against people who weren't doing anything to us, based on a vague threat posed by their resident despot. The relentless drip of American blood is considered a reasonable price for a venture that has yet to be objectively justified.

<p>Again, changing circumstances -- in this case, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- dramatically transmogrified our principles. What once was unacceptable is now advocated. America, once the great and wise king of the global jungle for whom restraint was a noble attribute, has become a snarling hyena poised to attack any nation at the first sign of obstinacy -- and a considerable portion of the American people don't seem to mind.

<p>But a principle isn't really a principle if it shifts every time circumstances change, or when it applies to some people but not others.

<p>One wonders if that thought will cross Rush Limbaugh's mind as he recovers from his unfortunate addiction in nurturing surroundings of a clinic rather than a locked concrete cell.
