<p>Now come reports of financial shenanigans involving preferential deals for favored wealthy clients of the $7 trillion mutual fund industry. Not a result of a few bad eggs, but a systematic violation of fiduciary trust. To be sure, not every firm or stockbroker is implicated in the scandal, but enough reputable firms are involved to cast suspicion over the entire industry.

 

<p>Most every sector of our corporate economy is beset if not by overt scandal, then by a corruption-breeding culture of personal greed and cynicism towards government. Why is it that so many people who already have enough, connive and conspire (or if they’re athletes and entertainers throw snit fits) to get even more? 

 

<p>It’s telling that the mutual fund scandal was not uncovered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal regulatory agency charged with regulating the financial markets. As in other cases involving Wall Street crime, it was New York State’s Attorney-General Elliot Spitzer who uncovered the criminal acts. Elsewhere, it’s been courageous “whistleblowers” that have exposed the malfeasance of corporate moguls. 

 

<p>It’s the role of the SEC and other regulatory agencies to protect the public. But they are not doing their job. One cannot trust the federal regulatory agencies in the current political climate.

 

<p>Hatred of government, promoted by right-wing free-market ideologues, has become an accepted part of our political culture. Government, as described by Vermont’s feisty, partisan Republican Dwinnell Political Report (in paraphrasing a speech by right-wing columnist P.J. O'Rourke) “is for the folks who covet that which they do not have and do not want to work for.” Aside from the fact that this insults every working American, it is also factually wrong. As evidenced by the public policy of the two Bush and Reagan administrations, as well by the politics of the “New Democrats” of the Democratic Leadership Council, government exists to protect and enhance the wealth, power, and privilege of the corporate sector. Right-wing Republicans quietly love government when it puts money into their politics, but publicly disdain it when it works for the public good. 

 

<p>Some examples: The Federal Communication Communications (FCC) promotes and enriches corporate media, making it difficult for locally-owned independent radio and TV stations to stay in business. The decisions of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) consistently undermine the legislative substance of campaign finance reform. Agencies of the Labor Department, instead of protecting worker rights, use their power to block union organizing. Agricultural agencies support the needs of corporate farmers and timber corporations, not family farmers and the loggers who work in the forest. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in violation of its mission, essentially serves to protect corporate polluters from environmental regulations. This is especially true with the current Bush administration. Despite melting polar ice caps and mountain glaciers, the administration continues to deny the problem of global warming, censoring assertions by the EPA’s own professional scientists that a crisis is building.

 

<p>Regulatory agencies don’t exist in a political vacuum. They reflect the priorities of elected officials. So the new energy bill, drafted in secret by Republicans rolling in campaign contributions from energy and resource interests (Senator Pete Domenici, chief-sponsor of the bill, received more than $400,000 from favored industries), grants billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to the oil, gas and nuclear industries with a token investment for clean energy research. 

 

<p>Corporate interests rule in every field. The administration gives the senior citizens a much-needed pharmaceutical benefit, but drafts the bill to undermine Medicare. If passed by the Senate, insurance companies would be able to cherry-pick the healthiest seniors, leaving an underfunded government system to finance the care of those elders who need health care the most.

 

<p>The country cannot sustain its current direction. Climate change, dirty air, loss of our industrial base, no jobs program, under funded schools, huge trade and revenue deficits, a widening income gap propelled by unfair compensation and tax policies, and a band-aid approach to white-collar corruption do not bode well for America’s future. 

 

<p>We need a new deal or, more accurately, the old deal, the kind of government that Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced in the 1930s: a mixed economy with public investment where private investment is insufficient; progressive taxation; respect for the individual as a human being and not a corporate entity; vigorous regulatory oversight; an expansion of social security, universal health insurance and other social benefits so no citizen goes uncared for, or is homeless or hungry. A new New Deal would again guarantee working people the right to organize, and would put people to work, building roads, parks, campgrounds, hiking trails, airports, hospitals, schools, and museums; teaching; and, even, creating art. 

 

<p>The New Deal era, however desperate the economic depression, was a patriotic time of people coming together in which personal interest meshed with the public good.  

Though economic right-wingers hated FDR with a toxicity that, more than half a century later, still affects the way they think of federal programs (except the ones that benefit themselves), the New Deal saved capitalism from the destructive dynamics of economic concentration, monopoly, and free market deregulation. 

 

<p>A new New Deal would represent more than new political leadership. It would mean resisting the cynicism that government is evil; it would mean reasserting the public interest as a patriotic project; it would mean participating critically but actively in all levels of government; it would mean taking the government back from the big money campaign contributors who expect and get a high rate of return for their investment in elected officials.  

 

<p>There are many political models. Communism doesn’t work and neither does the other extreme of free market, laissez-faire capitalism. The pragmatic New Deal, with its emphasis on economic fairness and social justice, is a viable American model on which to build a new consensus.
