<p>"Where there is a vision, the people flourish."

<p>This is a slight re-phrasing of a quote from Proverbs 29:18, in order to underscore that the greatest shortcoming among progressive people today, people who cherish democracy and freedom for all people, is the distinct lack of any unifying, uplifting vision.

<p>Why is this important?

<p>The post-9/11 world continues to unfold around us and within us.  The fabric of our very psyches -- individually and collectively -- has been torn and damaged in ways that are unsettling and disorienting in the extreme.  What began as shock, denial, and grief, and an opening into a vision of our common humanity, has now mutated into a relentless state of anger, fear, and a closing down of our hearts and minds.  Our current administration has been effective in keeping us terrified, over-stimulated with the specter of the next terror attack.  And, as many of us know from research studies on responses to uninterrupted stress, we either collapse into despair, dissociate into a psychotic break from reality (in less clinical terminology, we step-up our shopping), or rise to the occasion.

<p>This is addressed to those who are eager and determined to rise to the occasion.

<p>Our most dramatic rising to date has been the worldwide peace demonstrations that linked us in a global vision that, at bottom, regardless of the specific content of slogans and banners, proclaimed the deep truth that war is an archaic and unacceptable action at this time in our evolution.

<p>This sentiment represents -- to use philosopher Ken Wilber's expression
-- a "growing tip of consciousness."

<p>What I believe this means is that these demonstrations were not only about the war on Iraq, but more importantly, they were expressions of a growing understanding (conscious to some, unconscious to most) that we are indeed one global village and that war is anathema to our shared humanity.  Because of this, what I am identifying as a growing tip of consciousness -- our deep knowing that the people of the world have more in common than not --  needs to be tended, cultivated, and incorporated into a vision.  It is this leading edge of consciousness that must be recognized and promoted if real change, real evolution beyond economic woe and war is ever to be realized.

<p>Imagine all of us contemplating an image of Earth as our collective home, meditating -- perhaps daily -- upon the meaning of this profound truth, allowing that meaning to saturate our every cell. Imagine using this vision
-- "does it help or hinder our planet" -- as the touchstone of how we evaluate political action, economic policy, environmental decisions.

<p>This is vital because in the aftermath of the war on Iraq (and the pending war on Iran, and who knows where next), progressives in the U.S. are on the verge of drowning this "tip of consciousness" in the waters of electoral politics, or "regime change" in Washington, D.C.  This is not to say that voting in general, or voting Bush out in particular, is not part of an overall process.  But if this is the limit of our vision
-- voting in the next politician -- are we not in danger of squandering that beautiful impulse towards the conscious realization that we all share this one small planet?

<p>Why is it that the pundits look at the nine or so Democratic contenders for President and describe them as "flailing."  Why did "Time" magazine place FDR on its cover and wonder aloud if there will ever be a Democratic leader like him?  What truth are they on to with these musings?

<p>Some things are certain -- it is not Bush's post-war popularity, not the Republicans' fundraising juggernaut, not his straight-talking, regular-guy persona that is driving the Democrats (and many
progressives) to distraction.  It is the fact they have constructed a vision of the world and a plan to achieve it.  Their vision of empire and apocalypse is compelling for some precisely because it matches the average level of consciousness throughout the world today: a consciousness that is mired in fearful self-interest filtered through national-interest, and their mutual reinforcement. 

<p>If we progressives, because of our own fears (of Bush & Co., terrorists, our own mortality, etc.), continue to operate at this average level of consciousness -- a level that amounts to seeing everything through the twin lenses of tribalism and nationalism -- and focus pragmatically on the next election without the establishment of a unifying vision that is global in its perspective, then we have no chance of fundamentally interrupting the grinding treadmill of perpetual war.

<p>This means creating and holding a global vision, and rallying people by speaking to the best in them, even if it's a slow process and an initially unpopular stance; even if W. gets another term in office.  The current administration's vision, inspired by fear and the basest self-interest, can only be answered by a bold vision that imagines a world that could be and places us on the road to get there.
 
<p>I am reminded of mythologist and teacher, Joseph Campbell, lamenting deeply the loss of a guiding myth in our modern world. Campbell attributed the world's restlessness, aimlessness and devolution to wars and strife to this lack of a centering vision.  What he offered at the time -- which I believe holds even more power today -- was the image of the Earth photographed from space.  

<p>It is a fine image to represent this growing tip of consciousness, for it captures the deep human impulse that brought millions into the streets for peace only a few short months ago.  It is time we take all that energy and raise it to another level.  Nothing less than our home is at stake.
