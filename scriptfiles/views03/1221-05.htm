<p>As the climax of an epic ballad, it's hard to beat the capture of Saddam Hussein. Finally tracked down to a squalid hole, the black-eyed tyrant was confronted by soldiers &#8212; so the story goes &#8212; taunting him with contemptuous greetings from the leader of the free world.<P>
</P>The only thing that might have made the capture even more riveting would have been if it had coincided with George W. Bush's recent visit to Baghdad, thereby giving the U.S. president a chance to personally taunt the ravenous ex-dictator by denying him some holiday turkey. <P>
</P>(In fact, it was U.S. troops who ended up taunted by the apparently succulent golden-brown bird, which turned out to be for decorative purposes only, according to a report in the Washington Post.)<P>
</P>But in addition to being a story of epic proportions, Saddam's capture last weekend is being widely touted as the Big Event That Changes Everything, as the turning point that should finally make everyone throw away any doubts or objections they've ever had about the war. <P>
</P>That would make sense if the doubts or objections had been about Washington's ability to capture Saddam.<P>
</P> It would make sense, for instance, if the contentious debate that raged for weeks at the United Nations last winter had revolved around the question of whether the U.S. could capture the Iraqi dictator, with Washington insisting that it could, while France, Germany and Russia insisted such a capture was impossible.<P>
</P> But that wasn't what the debate was about.<P>
</P> 
None of the countries opposing the war at the U.N. &#8212; nor any of the millions of people who joined street protests around the world &#8212; ever doubted that the U.S. could use its superior military power to crush Saddam's regime and, ultimately, capture him. Rather, the debate centered on Washington's allegation that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction that posed such an imminent danger to the world that an invasion had to be launched immediately.
<P>
</P>Of course the weapons were never found, which raised the potent question of whether the administration had lied to its own people &#8212; and the world &#8212; about its motives for war. <P>
</P>In a well-functioning democracy, that would be considered a serious charge, which would put a lot of heat on the government.<P>
</P> 
But no real heat ever materialized in this case. And now, with Saddam's capture, we're being urged to forget that the U.S. was ever looking for anything other than the disheveled dictator.
<P>
</P>
David Bercuson, director of the Center for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary, argued on CBC-TV's <i>The National</i> last week that Saddam's capture was "going to help do away with the weapons of mass destruction issue." 
<P>
</P>
This makes it sound as if the whole weapons issue was just some trifling matter that disgruntled types keep harping on, rather than being the very Center of the administration's case for war.
<P>
</P> It wasn't the left that turned WMD into a household phrase last winter; it was the White House.<P>
</P>New York Times correspondent Todd S. Purdum last week described Saddam's capture as "the sweetest kind of vindication for a president who has earned worldwide skepticism." Weapons of mass destruction were not even mentioned in the article, they've been airbrushed from history. <P>
</P>Why rain on Bush's parade?<P>
</P>It's not surprising that those in the administration would try to stonewall and avoid admitting that they misled the world about their war motives, but it's a little unsettling to see academics and journalists so keen to let the White House crowd off the hook. <P>
</P>But then, the political discourse on these sorts of subjects has seemed pretty dysfunctional since 9/11. <P>
</P>Instead of tough critiques and attempts to probe to the bottom of things, we're supposed to let ourselves get caught up in stirring epic tales of good triumphing over evil. <P>
</P>So, for instance, there was virtually no coverage last week of a story that seemed at least as important as the capture of Saddam: The chairman of the U.S. commission investigating 9/11 said that the Sept. 11 attacks could have been prevented, and that officials responsible for that failure haven't been fired. <P>
</P>This guy is a Republican, appointed by the White House. This raises the question of whether the current administration is competent to protect the public in the most basic way.<P>
</P>But enough of that. Back to the main story ... did they really find Mars bars and unwrapped underwear packages in that little hut where the tyrant hid? ... and can we look forward to a "spider hole" special on a home-decorating episode about designing for small spaces? </i></p>
