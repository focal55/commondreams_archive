<p>Every new revelation about the insider deal given Halliburton, the oil industry conglomerate run by Dick Cheney until he became vice president, suggests that the Bush administration has positioned the company to reap huge profits in Iraq. 

<p>While the government's contract with Halliburton was initially described as a deal that permitted the company to extinguish oil well fires and otherwise repair wells, a recent letter from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., revealed that the Texas-based firm's contract also permits it to engage in the "operation of facilities and distribution of products." 

<p>For Americans who are not so well versed in the economics of the oil industry as Cheney, it should be noted that a permit to operate some of the world's richest oil fields and to distribute the oil pumped from those fields is better than a license to print money. 

<p>Waxman is trying to get more details about what exactly Halliburton will be permitted to do in Iraq, what profits the company will reap, and how a company once run by the vice president has ended up with a contract worth - according to the Corps of Engineers - as much as $7 billion. 

<p>These are not the only questions that need to be asked with regard to war profiteering. But they are the critical questions. 

<p>If Halliburton, a company that less than two years ago looked to be in severe financial trouble, is allowed to reap windfall profits from a war promoted and managed by its former chief executive officer, then it is difficult to imagine how any controls will ever be placed on profiteering. 

<p>So far, Waxman's courageous effort to expose the Halliburton deal has been a relatively lonely struggle. Though he has received some support from another powerful House Democrat, Michigan's John Dingell, Waxman's crusade has not become a central issue for Democrats and for responsible Republicans. This needs to change. 

<p>The revelations regarding Halliburton suggest that the war profiteers are on the march. It is time for a coalition of the willing - in Congress - to fight back.
