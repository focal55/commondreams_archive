<p>I believe in this beautiful country.  I have studied its roots and 

 gloried in the wisdom of its magnificent Constitution.  I have 

 marveled  at the wisdom of its founders and framers.  Generation 

 after generation  of Americans has understood the lofty ideals that 

 underlie our great  Republic.  I have been inspired by the story of 

 their sacrifice and  their strength. 



 <p>But, today I weep for my country.  I have watched the events of recent

months with a heavy, heavy heart.  No more is the image of America

one  of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper.  The image of America has

changed.  Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is 

 disputed, our intentions are questioned. 



<p>Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand 

 obedience or threaten recrimination.  Instead of isolating Saddam  

 Hussein, we seem to have isolated ourselves.  We proclaim a new 

 doctrine  of preemption which is understood by few and feared by 

 many.  We say  that the United States has the right to turn its 

 firepower on any corner  of the globe which might be suspect in the 

 war on terrorism.  We assert  that right without the sanction of any 

 international body.  As a result,  the world has become a much more 

 dangerous place.



<p>We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance.  We treat UN Security

  Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity by 

 lifting  their heads from the carpet.  Valuable alliances are split.



<p>After war  has ended, the United States will have to rebuild much

 more than the  country of Iraq.  We will have to rebuild America's 

 image around the  globe.



<p>The case this Administration tries to make to justify its fixation

 with  war is tainted by charges of falsified documents and 

 circumstantial  evidence.  We cannot convince the world of the 

 necessity of this war for  one simple reason.  This is a war of 

 choice. 



<p>There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11.

 The  twin towers fell because a world-wide terrorist group, Al Qaeda,

with  cells in over 60 nations, struck at our wealth and our

 influence by  turning our own planes into missiles, one of which 

 would likely have  slammed into the dome of this beautiful Capitol 

 except for the brave  sacrifice of the passengers on board.



 <p>The brutality seen on September 11th and in other terrorist attacks we

have witnessed around the globe are the violent and desperate

 efforts by  extremists to stop the daily encroachment of western 

 values upon their  cultures.  That is what we fight.  It is a force 

 not confined to  borders.  It is a shadowy entity with many faces, 

 many names, and many  addresses.



 <p>But, this Administration has directed all of the anger, fear, and

 grief  which emerged from the ashes of the twin towers and the 

 twisted metal of  the Pentagon towards a tangible villain, one we can

see and hate and  attack.  And villain he is.  But, he is the wrong

 villain.  And this is  the wrong war.  If we attack Saddam Hussein, 

 we will probably drive him  from power.  But, the zeal of our friends

to assist our global war on  terrorism may have already taken flight.



 <p>The general unease surrounding this war is not just due to "orange 

 alert."  There is a pervasive sense of rush and risk and too many 

 questions unanswered.   How long will we be in Iraq?  What will be the

cost?  What is the ultimate mission?  How great is the danger at home?



<p>A pall has fallen over the Senate Chamber.  We avoid our solemn duty

to  debate the one topic on the minds of all Americans, even while

 scores of  thousands of our sons and daughters faithfully do their 

 duty in Iraq. 



 <p>What is happening to this country?  When did we become a nation which

  ignores and berates our friends?  When did we decide to risk 

 undermining  international order by adopting a radical and 

 doctrinaire approach to  using our awesome military might?  How can 

 we abandon diplomatic efforts  when the turmoil in the world cries 

 out for diplomacy?



 <p>Why can this President not seem to see that America's true power lies

  not in its will to intimidate, but in its ability to inspire? 



 <p>War appears inevitable.  But, I continue to hope that the cloud will 

lift.  Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run.  Perhaps reason will

somehow still prevail.  I along with millions of Americans will pray

for  the safety of our troops, for the innocent civilians in Iraq,

 and for  the security of our homeland.  May God continue to bless the

 United  States of America in the troubled days ahead, and may we

 somehow  recapture the vision which for the present eludes us.
