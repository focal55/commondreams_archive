</table></font>Snowflakes and EGGS?
<p>Before the WAR someone knocked on my door.  I had hung my big peace sign flag on the porch the day before and was sure it would be a complaint. Our pretty Boulevard heads right down to the waterfront where the USS.Lincoln is based.
<p>Peeking over the flag was a little lady.  Still thinking I was probably in trouble, I opened the door and she said, " Hi, I am your new neighbor across the street and we wanted to tell you how happy it made us to see your Peace Sign when we got up this morning."
<p>My husband invited her in.  She tells us she and her husband are in their 80s and he is a Veteran of WW2.  I told her the story of the "Coalmouse and the Dove." I also told her our son is a Navy veteran and how proud we are of
him.   We drank coffee and talked. I walked her home.
<p>The next day they had an "Impeach Bush" poster and a "No War in Iraq" poster on their porch and a "Peace Flag" on their flag pole.

</table></font>We became friends and traded political pins, bouquets, and our horror over the war.

<p>The Lincoln is on its way home.
<p>This morning there was a call on my answering machine.  It was my new friend.  She said, "Someone tore up our posters and threw eggs at our house in the night."  So much for freedom.  She said she felt like there was a death in the family.  I went to our porch and sure enough, eggs all over the house.  I am not surprised but she was.
<p>I called her.  She told me her husband had visited a few other houses this morning with "NO WAR in IRAQ" Posters on their houses and they had been "EGGED" too.

<p>My husband and I are flute makers.  We provide songbooks with our instruments.  We have published over a hundred thousand in the last twenty five years.  Each one has this story on the back:
<p> <i><b>The Weight of a Snowflake
</b></i>
<p><i>"Tell me the weight of a snowflake," a coalmouse asked a wild dove. </i>
<p><i>"Nothing more than nothing," the dove answered. </i>
<p><i>"In that case I must tell you a marvelous story," the coalmouse
said.   "I sat on a fir branch close to the trunk when it began to
snow.  Not heavily, not in a raging blizzard.  No, just like in a dream, without any violence at all.  Since I didn't have anything better to do, I counted the snowflakes settling on the twigs and needles of my branch. Their number was exactly 3,471,952.  When the next snowflake dropped onto the branch--nothing more than nothing -- as you say -- the branch broke off."
</i>
<p><i>Having said that, the coalmouse ran away.

</i>
<p><i>The dove, since Noah's time an authority on peace, thought about the story for a while.  Finally, she said to herself, "Perhaps there is only one person's voice lacking for peace to come to the world."&nbsp; </i>- Source unknown
<p>Freedom again, is just another word.  Snowflakes and Eggs what a combination!
