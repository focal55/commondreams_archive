<p>On July 2, President Bush was asked to respond to the handful of attacks then taking place in Iraq each day.</p>
<p>"My answer is, bring them on," Bush said.</p>
<p>That was four months ago. At the time, 26 U.S. military personnel had been killed since the end of major combat. Now, the number will soon surpass 160. The number of attacks has escalated as well, to 30 or 35 a day, and have also grown more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Military officials in Iraq warn that the situation will get even worse over the next 30 to 60 days. A new CIA assessment confirms that fear, warning that an important turning point may have been reached, with more and more Iraqis now drawn into the struggle against us.</p>
<p>Today, there are no more complaints from the White House about all the good news that goes unreported. Managing image isn't the concern anymore; reality has intervened. Instead, we see hastily called top-level meetings and talk of sudden policy and even personnel changes. The cockiness has been stripped away, the bravado exposed as false.</p>
<p>Military officials have grown so frustrated that in Fallujah, we are turning to aerial bombardment in an attempt to cow the civilian population into submission, an act that concedes that winning hearts and minds is no longer possible. The long, hard slog that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned against privately, and belatedly, is upon us.</p>
<p>In the broad reassessment of U.S. policy that now seems under way, the most important step may be to redefine victory. The invasion of Iraq was rationalized in many ways, some more baseless than others, but the most romantic and far-fetched was the notion that we could use force to impose a democracy even upon a foreign culture that would deeply resent our presence. If we continue to define victory as the creation of such a democracy, we define the terms of our own defeat.</p>
<p>Victory will be the creation of an Iraqi-based government powerful enough to rule Iraq without stooping to the cruelty and terror used by Saddam Hussein. We'll be lucky to accomplish that much, but if we do, we ought to be willing to call it good.</p>
<p>The Bush administration will not admit to such a change in its goals, but it seems to be doing so nonetheless. The initial policy of withholding sovereignty from the Iraqis until a constitution is drafted, an election is held and a new democratic government is installed is rather quickly being abandoned. The initial decision to disband the Iraqi army has been rethought as well, with tens of thousands of Iraqis now enlisting and being shoved through training.</p>
<p>From the beginning, foreign-policy experts have talked of a small window of opportunity for the United States to establish security and restore sovereignty before the aggravations of occupation began to turn Iraqis against us. While it's too early to tell whether that window is now closing, the signs are ominous.</p>
<p>Another window, equally important, may be closing as well. Millions of Americans would support this president and this war for years to come, no matter what. Millions of others opposed this war and this president from the beginning. But our ability as a nation to sustain this war effort depends on those many millions who belong in neither camp. While never enthusiastic about the war, those Americans accepted their leaders' assurances that it was necessary for national security and that the risks of occupation were manageable.</p>
<p>Now that the war appears to have been neither necessary nor manageable, doubts are sinking in. Public support is dropping, and members of Congress are clearly nervous. They are trapped between their respect for public opinion and their realization that withdrawing from Iraq anytime in the foreseeable future would be a national security disaster.</p>
<p>Inevitably, some will blame that change of heart on a supposedly fickle American people. The blame is mislaid. In a democracy, leaders should never commit to a potentially lengthy war without ensuring that their citizens are prepared to sustain that commitment. If they do, the blame lies with the leaders, not those they failed to lead.</p>
