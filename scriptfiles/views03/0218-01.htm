<p>DES MOINES - The shorthand description of Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Dennis Kucinich&#039;s platform for his just-launched presidential bid is that he is the anti-war candidate for the 2004 Democratic nomination. And the Ohio representative who last week joined five other congressmen to sue President Bush in a move aimed at blocking a unilateral attack on Iraq is certainly that.
<p>But when Kucinich made his first swing across Iowa - where next January&#039;s caucuses will begin the Democratic Party&#039;s nominating process - some of the loudest applause was for his position on an issue that most other candidates have never even discussed: food labeling.
<p>Since his election to the House in 1996, Kucinich has been the most outspoken advocate in Congress for labeling food products that have been genetically altered or that contain genetically modified organisms. He has yet to prevail on that front, but Kucinich has been a key player in struggles to win federal approval for consumer- and farmer-friendly labeling of food that is grown organically.
<p>Kucinich&#039;s first speeches in Iowa have focused primarily on his opposition to war and on his criticisms of the corporate free trade pacts that have done damage to Midwestern manufacturing and agriculture. But at virtually every stop, he has been asked about his food fights.
<p>When he finished speaking at a party in Iowa City, for instance, an organic farmer ran up to the candidate, grabbed his hand and said, &#034;I just want to thank you for being our champion in Congress.&#034;
<p>Kucinich, who has struggled for years to get food labeling issues taken seriously in Congress, responded by telling the crowd, &#034;I&#039;ve always figured that if we are what we eat, it&#039;s good to know what we&#039;re eating.&#034;
<p>Later that night, when he was asked about Bush administration attempts to undermine newly enacted labeling rules for foods that are grown organically, the Ohio congressman said, &#034;We have to do everything we can to protect organic farming in particular. It&#039;s part of the bigger question of how to protect farmers and consumers in a rapidly changing global economy. Farmers need an advocate - someone who understands the economic dynamics, who understands what the food and farming issues are, and who isn&#039;t beholden to the corporate interests.&#034;
<p>By framing the debate over food labeling as a battle between farmers and consumers on one side and agribusiness conglomerates that oppose labeling and other forms of regulation on the other, Kucinich could push the dialogue about food safety and food quality to a point where it has never before been in presidential politics.
<p>&#034;Government has a moral responsibility to ensure the purity and safety of the food supply,&#034; he argues. &#034;We cannot abdicate this responsibility to global corporations whose goals may be limited to profit orientation.&#034;
<p>It is unlikely that debates about organic labeling or regulations on genetic modification of food will move all the way to the forefront of the 2004 political agenda. But if Kucinich makes them a part of the dialogue in Iowa - a state that takes farming and food seriously - he may yet be proved right when he tells Democrats here:
<p>&#034;Iowa has a chance to change the debate in this presidential election. You have a chance to expand the debate, to make it be about the issues that matter in people&#039;s lives.&#034;
