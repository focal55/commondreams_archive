<p>Choices for this Valentine&#39;s Day are more vexing than ever. Rarely have we needed the warm comfort of a lover&#39;s caress more, yet the phantom angst of a high alert is no aphrodisiac. </P>
<P>Waiting to be infected or irradiated or atomized gives off a sexless jolt for obvious reasons, but also because it&#39;s so passive. Maybe that&#39;s why a more aggressive romp, like going after Saddam, has such appeal to the Bush administration. And maybe why the amorous French hang back, knowing that in war, as in love, a little passivity can be a good thing. </P>
<P>So how should we celebrate love in this season of war? The ads in the newspaper aren&#39;t much help. One touts lingerie in sizzling red velvet right above another for an urban survival kit, which includes two gas masks, a chemical suit and a flashlight. It occurred to me to buy the undies and the kit, add a roll of duct tape and spend a romantic night trying out all three in the name of preparedness.</P>
<P>That seemed a little shallow for these times. I&#39;ve ruled out chocolates, because they&#39;re full of things we don&#39;t need -- a fleeting pleasure on the tongue, perhaps a flash as its renowned love-inducing chemicals surge through the brain, but then only a smudge on the fingers, a bulge on the hip.</P>
<P>Flowers are always favorites, although their tender fragility and earnest emergence from the dark earth into the maelstrom of human stupidity above them make them more disturbing than dazzling this year. Yet there&#39;s something about tulips, red ones for heartbreak, white ones for truth, that makes them contenders in the face of war.</P>
<P>Champagne, full of bubbly mirth and memories of celebrations, clashes with the somber mood, as do clever quips on Hallmark cards. It&#39;s a tough year, even for the hard-core romantic.</P>
<P>So this year I think the call is for poetry, whether sensual or sorrowful. The poetry of truth strikes our very bones. It helps us to love when it is most difficult. It articulates our grief when it has no shape.</P>
<P>And because the impotence of doing nothing is so unsuited to the day, join a peace march or duct tape your windows, depending on your outlook. But listen to poetry while you&#39;re doing it: W.H. Auden, Maya Angelou, Robert Bly, Mary Oliver, Wislawa Szymborska.</P>
<P>If the passive approach is more your mode, give a nod to the poets whom Laura Bush admirably wanted to celebrate on Feb. 12 -- Langston Hughes, Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson -- but canceled when she learned that Sam Hamill and other invited poets planned to read antiwar poems as well. Then read some of the spurned poetry on the Web at <A href="http://poetsagainstthewar.org" target=_new>http://poetsagainstthewar.org</A>.<!--NO online cq--></P>
<P>And at the end of the day, pull up the covers with your sweetie, if you&#39;re lucky enough to have one close by. Read anything that reminds you of the fragility of this earth and the fragrant balm that is love. On this Valentine&#39;s Day, make love, not war.</P>
