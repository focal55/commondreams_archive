<p>It's not what Arnold Schwarzenegger did to the girls a decade back that should raise an eyebrow.&nbsp; According to a series of memoranda our office obtained today, it's his dalliance with the boys in a hotel room just two years ago that's the real scandal.<p>The wannabe governor has yet to deny that on May 17, 2001, at the Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles, he had consensual political intercourse with Enron chieftain Kenneth Lay.&nbsp; Also frolicking with Arnold and Ken was convicted stock swindler Mike Milken.<p>Now, thirty-four pages of internal Enron memoranda have just come through this reporter's fax machine tell all about the tryst between Maria's husband and the corporate con men.&nbsp; It turns out that Schwarzenegger knowingly joined the hush-hush encounter as part of a campaign to sabotage a Davis-Bustamante plan to make Enron and other power pirates then ravaging California pay back the $9 billion in illicit profits they carried off.<p>Here's the story Arnold doesn't want you to hear.&nbsp; The biggest single threat to Ken Lay and the electricity lords is a private lawsuit filed last year under California's unique Civil Code provision 17200, the "Unfair Business Practices Act."&nbsp; This litigation, heading to trial now in Los Angeles, would make the power companies return the $9 billion they filched from California electricity and gas customers.<p>It takes real cojones to bring such a suit.&nbsp; Who's the plaintiff taking on the bad guys?&nbsp; Cruz Bustamante, Lieutenant Governor and reluctant leading candidate against Schwarzenegger.<p>Now follow the action.&nbsp; One month after Cruz brings suit, Enron's Lay calls an emergency secret meeting in L.A. of his political buck-buddies, including Arnold.&nbsp; Their plan, to undercut Davis (according to Enron memos) and "solve" the energy crisis -- that is, make the Bustamante legal threat go away.<p>How can that be done?&nbsp; Follow the trail with me.<p>While Bustamante's kicking Enron butt in court, the Davis Administration is simultaneously demanding that George Bush's energy regulators order the $9 billion refund.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't hold your breath:&nbsp; Bush's Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is headed by a guy proposed by … Ken Lay.<p>But Bush's boys on the commission have a problem.&nbsp; The evidence against the electricity barons is rock solid:&nbsp; fraudulent reporting of sales transactions, megawatt "laundering," fake power delivery scheduling and straight out conspiracy (including meetings in hotel rooms).<p>So the Bush commissioners cook up a terrific scheme:&nbsp; charge the companies with conspiracy but offer them, behind closed doors, deals in which they have to pay only two cents on each dollar they filched.<p>Problem:&nbsp; the slap-on-the-wrist refunds won't sail if the Governor of California won't play along.&nbsp; Solution:&nbsp; Re-call the Governor.<p>New Problem:&nbsp; the guy most likely to replace Davis is not Mr. Musclehead, but Cruz Bustamante,&nbsp; even a bigger threat to the power companies than Davis.&nbsp; Solution:&nbsp; smear Cruz&nbsp; because -- heaven forbid! -- he took donations from Injuns (instead of Ken Lay).<p>The pay-off?&nbsp; Once Arnold is Governor, he blesses the sweetheart settlements with the power companies.&nbsp; When that happens, Bustamante's court cases are probably lost.&nbsp; There aren't many judges who will let a case go to trial to protect a state if that a governor has already allowed the matter to be "settled" by a regulatory agency.<p>So think about this.&nbsp; The state of California is in the hole by $8 billion for the coming year.&nbsp; That's chump change next to the $8 TRILLION in deficits and surplus losses planned and incurred by George Bush.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the $8 billion deficit is the hanging rope California's right wing is using to lynch Governor Davis.<p>Yet only Davis and Bustamante are taking direct against to get back the $9 billion that was vacuumed out of the state by Enron, Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Company and the other Texas bandits who squeezed the state by the bulbs.<p>But if Arnold is selected, it's 'hasta la vista' to the $9 billion.&nbsp; When the electricity emperors whistle, Arnold comes -- to the Peninsula Hotel or the Governor's mansion.&nbsp; The he-man turns pussycat and curls up in their lap.<p>I asked Mr. Muscle's PR people to comment on the new Enron memos -- and his strange silence on Bustamante's suit or Davis' petition.&nbsp; But Arnold was too busy shaving off his Hitlerian mustache to respond.<p><i>The Enron memos were discovered by the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, Los Angeles, <A href="http://www.ConsumerWatchdog.org">www.ConsumerWatchdog.org</A></i></P>
