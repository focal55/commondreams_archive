<p>Dear Friends,



<p>It is impossible to describe.  It is like we are

submerged in a glowing yellow-orange cloud here in the

city.  Our Iraqi friends say they have never seen

anything like it.  It is eerier than any science

fiction film I've ever seen.  Some say it is caused by

a combination of the burning oil and the billowing

smoke from the bombs.  Both near and far the bombs

continue to fall.  



<p>Heavy bombing woke me out of a deep sleep last night. 

Earlier I'd been on the telephone  with a friend who

told me that in her neighborhood a missile had struck

the day before wounding 29 and killing 5.  Among the

dead was a 12 year old.  "Cathy" she said, "please

tell them (the U.S.) to stop talking about

humanitarian aide."  Apparently this keeps coming on

over the television news.  "Please tell them to shut

up!"  How ludicrous to speak of humanitarian aide as

the country is being bombed, people being killed and

wounded and their homes destroyed!   



<p>The Bush administration said a couple of days ago that

the war has been successful because so far there have

been only 500 casualties.  I am anxious to get word to

you about some of these "casualties" as I've been to

the trauma hospitals these last 3 days to see for

myself.  This is not to mention the trauma of fear and

terror of the bombing which has no end.  As I write

you the bombs continue and the windows threaten to

explode.  Should I move somewhere else?  There really

is no safe place.

Nada Adnan, 14 years old and a student at high school for girls, states &quot;I wish that God would take Bush. Why did he do this to us? to me?&quot;. She has an open gash on her right cranium with underlying fracture and a large, deep shrapnel gauged cut into her upper left thigh. She has no narcotic relief and cries out as aides press guaze into her leg wound. <br>

</table></font>Let me tell you about Amar, a 7 year old boy whom I

saw in the hospital this morning.  He has an emergency

chest tube to drain blood as he suffered multiple

shell injuries.  His mother, Hannah, died in the

direct hit to their house this morning. He is from a

farming village on the outskirts of Baghdad.  Then

there is Mueen, 8 years old also the son of a farmer,

but from another area.  He is in the bed alongside

Amar and also has a drainage tube.  But his is from

the abdomen.  The doctor showed us a plastic bag

holding parts of his small intestine which had to be

removed during surgery in order to try and get to all

of the shrapnel.  His father died in that bombing, and

his 6 year old brother Ali was wounded in the head.   

 

<p>Shall I go on?  Ten year old Rusel was wounded in an

explosion outside her door.  We saw the shrapnel in

her chest on the Xray and she too has a chest tube. 

Her right hand is fractured.  I had seen her yesterday

and to my surprise she remembered me.  We played with

the finger puppet of the frog for a moment and I

decided to leave it with her.  I told her that I was

going to tell other children what a brave little girl

she is.  Her father said "Bush said he'd bring

democracy to Iraq.  This is not democracy.  This is

terrorism!"  



<p>Nada Adnan is a 14 year old high school student who

came in with a deep gash and fracture to her right

forehead.  She also has a hunk of shrapnel in her

upper thigh..

Some of our folks were present when she and her family

were brought into the hospital.  Her mother had to be restrained as she was so distraught.  A missile had crashed into her uncle's home where they were staying, causing the walls to collapse. Nada's 8 year old sister had died as a result.  Nada said "Is this good what is happening here?  How many children have been killed?  How many wars they've done to us?  And we have so much pain.All the countries know that Bush has committed a crime."



<p>An elderly woman, Fatima, had fallen in fear during

the bombing and fractured her hip.  She had already

had surgery for the hip, but her ankle too is in a

cast and her knee is wounded.  Mohammed her husband

said  "We are not the enemy or against you.  We love

freedom for everyman, for every human in the world. 

Bush is not human.  He is the enemy against humanity."

 

<p>We meet Ali and his wife in the hospital, the parents

of four young children.  They tell us that they want

the war to stop for the children's sake, for the

mothers.  They say that families are all leaving their

homes to run away from the bombs.  They try and stay

all together at one of their relatives homes.  "If we

die, we want to die together."  Ali works in a food

shop, they explain.  But all of the stores are closed

and there is no work.  No money coming in.  The

children no longer go to school.  All of their

children are fearful and hiding under the covers.  



<p>And Mr. Bush says the war is successful.  Children

maimed for life.  Children orphaned in an instant. 

Their homes destroyed.  Their young men forced to

fight.  A peaceful people visited by unspeakable

terror and violence.   Oh tell me Mr. Bush, what

should I do with my anger, with my rage?  Can you tell

me what to say to the people here when they ask me

what have they done?, when they ask me why is this

happening?  



<p>They know I am from America.  As I meet their

questioning eyes and despairing expressions I have no

words.  Mr. Bush, shall I tell them that the war so

far is a success.  I can only say "I'm sorry" on

behalf of us all.  And, please God stay the hand of my

nation.  



<p>Love,<br>

Cathy
