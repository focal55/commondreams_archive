<p>On March 29, some 35,000 to 45,000 people from across New England came 
together on the Boston Common for a march and rally to speak out for peace 
and justice in Iraq. As an African-American who has been involved in the 
peace movement since I was a teenager in the early 1980's -- and as one of 
the moderators at Saturday's rally -- I was incredibly moved by the breadth 
and vitality of our movement -- even in the midst of this war.

<p>Clearly, however, marching is not enough. If the peace movement wants to 
keep building on the momentum generated by this historic event -- and 
dozens like it across the country and around the globe -- I see three main 
challenges that we will have to face in the weeks and months ahead. How we 
respond to these challenges will determine whether we can turn our growing 
numbers into a sustained effort to stop this war -- and to make our 
government's policies reflect the values our society should be based on.

<p>First, we must put forward a clear and achievable plan for ending the war 
in Iraq and preventing similar future conflicts. We believe in the rule of 
international law over the rule of force -- and that international 
conflicts must be resolved by the international community. The peace 
movement must demand an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of US and 
British troops from Iraq, supervised by UN peacekeeping forces. This should 
be part of a broader UN directed effort, both to provide humanitarian 
relief efforts and return weapons inspectors to finish the job that they 
had begun before the Bush Administration launched this war. All sanctions 
against Iraq -- other than arms-related sanctions -- should be immediately 
lifted and the Iraqi people allowed to rebuild their economy through an 
UN-administered program along the lines of the Oil for Food program.

<p>Second, we need to make sure that our movement looks like our country. 
Although there are unprecedented numbers of people of color, working-class 
people, and youth currently involved in peace activities, we still have a 
long way to go. We must bridge old divides of race and class, of young and 
old, and between the cities and suburbs. We must work to ensure that the 
issues and concerns of all of these constituencies become central to our 
movement -- and that activists move from working, not only against the war 
in Iraq, but to transform a range of US domestic and foreign policies.

<p>Third, we have to create a diverse array of local, city, and regional peace 
and justice groups, networks and institutions rooted in communities and 
accessible to everyone who wants to work for grassroots social change. That 
work has already started in neighborhoods across the Boston area, but there 
is much more that we need to do.

<p>We should recognize that not everyone who agrees with us will come to 
rallies and marches, so we must provide a broad range of opportunities, 
activities, and ways for people to participate. And we have to make sure 
that our movement reflects the values of the type of society we want to 
build -- we have to insist upon democracy, transparency, justice, fairness, 
and effectiveness inside our movement as strongly as we insist on it in our 
country.

<p>Finally, after this war ends, the peace movement needs to begin working on 
its own project of regime change -- not in Iran, or North Korea, but in 
Washington. And our "regime change" won't come through an invasion or 
bombing, but through sustained, grassroots, democratic activism.
