<p>It isn't so much the unforeseen consequences of the invasion that inflame the 
debate over post-war Iraq. No war ever goes according to plan. But it has become 
all too obvious that administration officials brushed aside all pre-war objections 
that didn't conform to a rosy outlook. The result is that U.S. forces are bearing 
a much greater burden than ex pected, and that they will continue to bear it largely 
alone and for a longer period than anyone anticipated. Americans have a right 
to be dismayed over the conduct of the occupation thus far, and skeptical about 
plans for the future. <p>Force-rotation plans <p>U.S. forces led the way in Gulf 
War I and the occupation of Haiti in the '90s, but they enjoyed an international 
mandate and the support of a genuine coalition to get the job done. Now, with 
the call-up of 43,000 National Guard and Reserve soldiers last week and continuing 
reluctance by Turkey, India and other countries to contribute forces to patrol 
Iraq, it is clear that the burden is almost fully on U.S. troops. More clearly 
than ever, this is America's war -- and the latest force-rotation plans offer 
no reassurance of change. <p>There are some 133,000 U.S. troops in Iraq at the 
moment. Yet the Pentagon has announced plans to reduce total troop strength to 
about 105,000 next year, even though Iraq remains a large, unpacified country 
with porous borders in a volatile part of the world. If this announcement is intended 
as reassurance that all is going well, it falls wide of the mark. Following a 
week that saw the deadliest single day of casualties since the early days of the 
war in March -- a week when even the headquarters of the American civilian authority 
came under attack -- that seems enormously optimistic. <p>Maybe, as Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld has said, Iraqi troops will be ready to assume a bigger role in 
pacification, but it's worth keeping in mind that unjustifiable optimism has been 
a hallmark of this entire effort. When Gen. Eric. K. Shinseki, the outgoing Army 
chief of staff, said in February that it might take 200,000 troops to secure postwar 
Iraq, Mr. Rumsfeld and his civilian aides scoffed. Today, it's obvious that, if 
anything, the general was too conservative in his estimate. <p>Size of the armed 
forces <p>The underlying problem is the size of the U.S. military force, as acting 
Army Chief of Staff Gen. John Keane, Gen. Shinseki's successor, told Congress 
in August. In Iraq, he said, ''We're short of infantry, we're short of chemical-biological 
soldiers, we're short of military police.'' In addition to the Iraqi deployments, 
U.S. forces maintain a presence in Afghanistan, South Korea, Bosnia, Kosovo and 
the Sinai. With only 10 active-duty divisions, the 480,000-man U.S. Army has been 
stretched almost to the breaking point by the war and the occupation. The demands 
on the 900,000-member Guard and Reserve units are equally stressful. <p>The occupation 
has turned into a ''long, hard slog,'' Mr. Rumsfeld conceded after the Chinook 
shoot-down. He should be equally candid in providing a realistic assessment of 
future requirements instead of offering premature expectations of troop reductions 
timed to coincide with the political campaign. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 1996-2003
