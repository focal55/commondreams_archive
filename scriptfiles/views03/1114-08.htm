<p>JERUSALEM--This is a historic, holy city, held sacred by Christians, Jews and Muslims. But today there is much unholiness in Jerusalem.

<p>A visitor tries to find out what is wrong and what can be done about it, but there are few clear answers. The Israelis are in charge, but their power gives them little comfort. The Palestinians in the Occupied Territories lead a bleak life--"like nails under Israel's hammer," as one Jewish activist put it. But the Palestinians keep striking back with their suicide bombings. There is no end in sight--for either the Occupation or the bombings.

<p>The principal conclusion drawn from a 10-day trip throughout Israel and Palestine is that the bombings are unlikely to stop until the military occupation stops. It is easy to deplore the terrorism, and it is tempting to believe it can be stopped with military force, but that simply is not happening. Experiencing the effects of the Occupation day after day, one can understand how it has driven some Palestinians literally crazy. "Israel has created a monster," said a Jewish social worker opposed to the Occupation.

<p>According to numerous polls, most Israelis want to end the Occupation. A survey last year by Mina Zemach, Israel's foremost pollster, showed 63 percent of Israelis are in favor of "unilateral withdrawal" from Palestine. Even the chief of staff of the Israeli Army, Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, came out recently against the government's counter-terrorism strategy. In a stinging public criticism of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government, Yaalon told the Haaretz newspaper that the military cannot defeat the Palestinians and "the policy being pursued by the government is undermining security and causing irreversible damage to Israeli society." However, Sharon continues to have strong support from the United States, and particularly from the U.S. Congress.

<p>As horrific as the bombings have been, rarely mentioned by the media is the fact that the Palestinian death toll in three years is triple the Israeli death toll--that's right, triple! A total of 769 Israeli civilians and security forces have been killed by Palestinians since the intifada (uprising) began; 2,274 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces and civilians in the same period, including a great many innocent non-combatants such as curfew violators and bystanders at the scene of assassinations. These statistics have been compiled by B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, a very reputable organization of Israeli lawyers, journalists and members of the Knesset (parliament). (www.btselem.org) Just last Friday (Nov. 7), Israeli troops shot and killed a 10-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud al-Qayed, east of Gaza City. The boy and two friends were trapping birds with a net near the border fence. An Army spokesman said they were in a restricted area and were "suspicious," so soldiers fired at them.

<p>The Occupation takes many forms: Curfews, checkpoints, roadblocks, enormous confiscation of land, demolition of thousands of homes, mass denial of work and travel permits, wholesale arrests and detentions, uprooting of olive trees. 

<p>"There is a red line between legitimate self-defense and collective punishment of innocent people, and it has been crossed," said Arik Ascherman of Rabbis for Human Rights, deploring the destruction of olive trees.

<p>Tensions have increased as Jewish "settlers" have moved into new housing developments in the Palestinian areas with the encouragement of the government and with financial help from the American Jewish community. And in the past year, the government has begun building a wall to separate Israelis and Palestinians; it is officially explained as a way to stop the bombers, but it is being built in such a way as to dispossess many Palestinian farmers of their lands.

<p>Curfews are declared by the Israeli Army at a moment's notice. They are often called after a disturbance between Palestinians and settlers. Palestinians are forbidden to leave their homes during a curfew, which may last only overnight or go on for several days. Young soldiers armed with M-16s patrol the streets. Violators, including children, are subject to arrest and are sometimes shot. The curfews apply only to Palestinians; Israelis are free to walk the streets.

<p>Curfews are but one element of the Occupation. Essentially, the 3.6 million Palestinians live at the mercy of the Israeli government. They must obtain permits to get jobs outside their own communities, and permits are hard to get, but jobs are scarce in Palestinian areas. The result is a 50 percent unemployment rate among Palestinians. (It's 11 percent in Israel.) Palestinians also must get permits to build homes in many areas. Again, the permits are hard to obtain, and if a Palestinian goes ahead and builds without a permit, the government frequently comes in with a bulldozer and demolishes the home. The Committee Against House Demolitions, an Israeli group, says more than 9,000 homes have been destroyed since the Six-Day War in 1967, leaving 50,000 people homeless.

<p>"The government's motivation for demolishing these homes is purely political and it violates all human rights covenants," Jeff Halper, coordinator of the Committee Against House Demolitions, said in an interview. Halper is a Minnesota anthropologist who moved to Israel in 1973. "There is an elaborate system of planning regulations and laws and procedures that give the policy a legal façade," he said. "The goal is to confine the residents of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza to small, crowded, impoverished and disconnected enclaves. This, in effect, forecloses any viable Palestinian entity and ensures Israeli control. In the long run, Israel wants to force Palestinians to leave the country altogether."

<p>Checkpoints are one of the most graphic examples of the Occupation. At a typical checkpoint, hundreds of Palestinians are lined up, on foot or in cars, to have their travel permits (to travel from town to town) checked one by one by soldiers. The wait can take hours. It is not unusual for ambulances to be forced to wait in line. Daniela Yoel of Machson Watch (Checkpoint Watch), a woman's group, told a chilling story: "Seven years ago I was at a checkpoint and a young woman was about to give birth. She had two boys in her womb. We pleaded with the soldiers to let her go through so she could get to a hospital, but they made her wait in line. The first baby was born and he died. We told the soldiers that there was a second baby, but they ignored us, and the second baby was born and he died, too. At about the same time, my daughter had twin boys. Now my little grandsons are seven, and as I watch them grow, I think of those boys . . . ."

<p>Ardie Geldman, who moved to Israel from Chicago in 1982 and lives in the Jewish settlement of Ephrata, said he "fully recognizes the horrific lives of the Palestinians--everything they're suffering," but he bristled at the term "occupied territories." "They are not occupied territories. This is the land of Israel. We were expelled 2,000 years ago and we came back," he said.

<p>There seems to be no solution. But a conversation with several Hebrew University students brought some hope. Although the students are generally pro-Israel, they were willing to look at the situation rationally. One said that if she and an Arab friend of hers--the younger generation--could replace Sharon and Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat, they could bring peace in a month. Another concluded: "Both sides think they have justice supporting their point of view. But what we need to do is put 'justice' aside and talk about compromise."
