<p>Maybe it's the stress of war, or maybe it's bad judgment. In any case, people thousands of miles from the front lines are behaving strangely in the name of patriotism. First came the New York Stock Exchange's ill-advised expulsion of Al Jazeera, the Arab television network, because of its reporting from Iraq. Now comes an equally knuckleheaded decision by Dale Petroskey, president of baseball's Hall of Fame, to cancel a 15th-anniversary celebration of the classic baseball movie "Bull Durham," scheduled to begin April 26 in Cooperstown, N.Y. Mr. Petroskey said he was offended by antiwar criticism by Tim Robbins, who starred in the film along with his real-life partner, Susan Sarandon, also a vigorous critic of the war. Their "very public" criticism, Mr. Petroskey said in a letter to Mr. Robbins, could "undermine" the war effort and ultimately "put our troops in even more danger."

<p>It's hard to know where to begin with this one. First of all, there is the little matter of free speech, one of the fruits of democracy we are supposed to be fighting for. Apparently it is O.K. for ordinary people to speak their minds but not O.K. for actors, who, Mr. Petroskey said, bear "a large obligation to speak and act responsibly." Then there is the politicizing of baseball, which is, after all, a "national pastime" that is supposed to belong to everyone. "I had been unaware that baseball was a Republican sport," Mr. Robbins observed in his return letter, adding that he had "looked forward to going to Cooperstown and getting away from politics."

<p>Mr. Petroskey, a former assistant press secretary in Ronald Reagan's White House, also seems to be suffering from a short memory. His own boss, Mr. Reagan, was not the least bit shy in using his prominence as an actor to advance his ideological agenda. Our guess is that this whole thing is not about anybody's politics but Mr. Petroskey's.
