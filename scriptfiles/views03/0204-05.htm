<p>The Pentagon has put out the word that the United States might
use nuclear weapons in a preventive war against Iraq. That's not a new 
idea. Nuclear threats and talk of preventive nuclear strikes have been 
with us since the early days of the Cold War. Now, as then, threatening
words will probably do more harm than good, even if they are never
translated into action.
<p>       In the 1950s, President Eisenhower committed the U.S. 
government to a first-strike nuclear policy. He told his advisers, 
"Ultimately some President might have to decide that it was his duty to
strike the first blow against the USSR. You try to shoot your enemy
before he shoots you."
<p>        Thanks to information from the Pentagon, we know how little has
changed in nearly half a century. The blueprint for a war with Iraq
includes contingency plans like Eisenhower's for using nuclear weapons.
As CBS News recently reported, the war plan is based on military
strategist Harlan Ullman's theory of "shock and awe" or "muscular 
containment": scare your enemies with such an awesome show of rapid, 
overwhelming force that they give up without a fight.
<p>        Eisenhower also used nuclear threats as psychological weapons. 
When Communist China shelled Taiwan's outposts on the islands of Quemoy
and Matsu in 1955, Eisenhower said openly that the United States might
respond with nuclear weapons, "as you would use a bullet." Privately, 
he left little doubt that he really would use nukes and risk World War 
III. As he once told the British ambassador in Washington, he "would 
rather be atomized than communized."
<p>        Now the Bush administration has combined the two pieces of 
Eisenhower's strategy: prepare for preventive nuclear strikes, but make
the preparations public, in order to wage psychological war against
Iraq. But considering the results Eisenhower reaped from his policies, 
the idea of combining the two gives little comfort.
<p>        Eisenhower's talk of using atomic weapons in China sparked 
outrage that did incalculable damage to U.S. prestige and diplomatic 
interests around the globe. In Europe, growing concern about U.S. 
"warmongering" threatened a rift in the NATO alliance in the 1950s,
just as it does today.
<p>        Trying to recoup from such public-relations setbacks,
Eisenhower promised to negotiate a disarmament deal with the Soviets. 
But the effort collapsed in 1960, after the Soviets shot down a U-2 spy
plane and captured pilot Gary Powers. The Soviet leader, Nikita
Khrushchev, reaped a propaganda coup by playing the role of aggrieved 
victim - a role Saddam Hussein is cultivating with some success now.
<p>        Eisenhower understood the risk he took by allowing a U-2 to fly
over Soviet airspace. But he had no choice, he said. His policy of
preventive attack was useless if he could not see what his enemy was
doing.
<p>        Everyone in the Kremlin knew that the United States could
indeed launch a preventive attack, and there was little the Soviets 
could do in response. This weakened Khrushchev at home. At the Paris 
summit meeting in 1960, he knew he had to put on a dramatic "tough guy"
show to save his political power. So he had no choice but to stalk out
of the summit and make Eisenhower look the fool.
<p>The U-2 fiasco ended the world's hopes for disarmament in that 
era. It left Eisenhower and the United States suspect in the world's 
eyes. Who could believe words of peace from a nation caught spying and 
preparing for war?  Khrushchev had to go on proving his toughness when 
President Kennedy succeeded Eisenhower. Kennedy, fearing that he would 
look young and weak, took the toughest stance he could. That duel of 
public images led straight to the brink of war in the Cuban missile
crisis of 1962.
<p>        No one can say yet what the Bush administration's talk of
preventive war with nuclear weapons will bring. The Eisenhower 
administration learned, painfully, just how unpredictable and 
uncontrollable the world is.
<p>       But it seems a safe bet that the Bush administration's 
"muscular containment" will breed muscular resistance, as Eisenhower's 
tough talk did in the 1950s. Other nations will feel compelled to take 
a harder stance toward the United States. Global tensions will
increase.
<p>        Nuclear bluster will make it hard for the world to take
seriously Washington's claim that it wants world peace. Sympathy for 
the American cause will continue to dwindle. The strains between the 
United States and NATO allies will grow.  Another attack on our soil 
might yield a lot less shock and awe than it did on Sept. 11, 2001.
<p>        Words must be taken seriously. When threats of preventive 
nuclear attack are launched, the words can cause future damage that far
outweighs anything gained by a policy of "shock and awe."
