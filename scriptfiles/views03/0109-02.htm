<p>Who has not clambered onto a bus, headed off to a protest 

demonstration and stood amid sparse company in the rain, thinking, "What's the 

use?" Who has not listened to some plucky orator rasping through a 

bullhorn, "Let our message go forth..." and thought privately, "Forth to 

whom? Who's listening? Who cares?" 

	<P>These days, there's a spirited movement growing across the United 

States opposing a war against Iraq. There have been some big events, like 

the rallies in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, attended by vast 

throngs. But there have also been rallies and vigils by the score in small 

towns. 

	<P>Are they making a difference? 

	<P>Of course they are, just like the demonstrations in Europe, the Middle 

East, Australia and elsewhere. U.S. ambassadors and CIA heads of 

station may deprecate and downplay the world protests in their reports, but 

they cannot dismiss them, any more than can the White House. How can you 

ignore a turnout of 500,000 in Florence? 

	<P>In short, protests count, just as they did in the very earliest days 

of organizing against the war in Vietnam. This organizing was undertaken 

by far-left groups, small Trotskyist and Maoist sects moving far ahead 

of the mainstream. 

	<P>When did these efforts begin? Back in 1963 and even earlier, half a 

decade before the huge throngs began to muster in Washington, D.C. In the 

past few weeks, many veterans of these early marches have been pooling 

their memories. Here's a recollection to me of one of the earliest, 

from Lawrence Reichard, who these days works as an organizer in Stockton, 

Calif., defending rural workers. 

	<P>"In the spring of 1962," Reichard says, "when I was 3 years old, my 

mother dragged me to a demonstration against the U.S. war in Laos in 

Cedar Rapids, Iowa. There were five people at that demo. My mom, my older 

brother, me and two others." Then, "In 1969, I rode in a VW bus from 

Charlotte, N.C., to Washington, D.C., for an anti-war demo that drew 

500,000. According to Daniel Ellsberg, that demo made President Nixon 

reconsider the madman recommendation of his Joints Chiefs of Staff to nuke 

Vietnam within a few miles of the Chinese border." 

	<P>That trip was especially memorable for him, Reichard continues, 

because he made it with the family of Norman Morrison, who immolated himself 

in front of the Pentagon in protest over the war. Reichard recalls that 

he read later that Lyndon B. Johnson's aides cut mention of Morrison's 

death out of his newspapers so he wouldn't see it. 

	<P>"On the rare occasion that I'm asked to speak at a demo, and the 

turnout is low," Reichard concludes, "I speak about the turnout in Cedar 

Rapids and the turnout in D.C. years later, as a way to rally the troops 

and lift spirits. Imperialism and colonialism are not stopped in a day!" 

He points out that "it is also noteworthy that in 1954 or 1955 the 

American Friends Service Committee wrote a letter to the Eisenhower 

administration warning against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Needless to say, 

the anti-war movement of today is way ahead of the movement that brought 

out five demonstrators in Cedar Rapids in the early '60s." 

	<P>Reichard ended thus, "The anti-war movement has much to be proud of. 

To the absolute fury of the right wing, the anti-war movement of 

yesterday and today still, to this day, shackles this country's ability to 

wage unfettered war. Right off the bat, they have to forget about any war 

that might last more than six months or cost more than a few hundred 

U.S. lives. For this, you can thank the peace movement and the 

Vietnamese, who, at tremendous cost, beat us militarily. The entire world owes a 

tremendous debt to the Vietnamese."</i></p>
