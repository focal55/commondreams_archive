<p>On Thursday afternoon from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. I served my first high school 
detention. It only took 46 years for me to reach this milestone. If you are wondering 
how this is possible, you are correct in concluding that I am not a high school 
student. I am a high school social studies teacher, a part time college professor, 
and a full time student advocate. The events which led to my self imposed detention 
began on Tuesday, November 11, Veteran¹s Day. <p>Minutes before the student body 
was to be dismissed from classes in order to assemble in the gymnasium for the 
traditional flag waving, chest pounding, patriotic pep rally a young man approached 
and asked if he had to attend the assemble. The student's request did not come 
as a surprise since on numerous occasions he has expressed his struggle with mandated 
patriotism. I informed the gentlemen that he had the freedom not to attend the 
program and since our school has the policy of providing a room for those who 
elect not to attend lyceums, he should ask the principal where to report. Having 
similar reservations as this young man, I elected not to attend the ceremony and 
therefore remained in the classroom. <p>With the hallway void of bustling students, 
it was easy to detect the sound of footsteps as they turned the corner and proceeded 
down the long corridor. As the sneaker clad feet reached the entrance of the classroom 
silence again filled the hallway. Pulling my eyes from the pages of Scott Hunt's, 
&quot;The Future of Peace&quot; I saw the young man standing in the doorway. Initially, 
I assumed that the principal instructed the student to return to the classroom, 
but his face absent of color told me otherwise. Quickly he spewed forth his conversation 
with the principal and how he did not have the freedom not to attend the Veteran's 
Day program. The administration stated that this was an educational event and 
attendance was mandatory. When he inquired why, he was instructed that he needed 
to learn about those who died for his freedom, plus, if he did not attend he would 
receive detention. The young man now wanted to know, could the administration 
do that? Could they give him detention? <p>During our ensuing conversation I challenged 
the young patriot seated before me to reframe his question. Possibly the issue 
was not could they, of course they could and WILL, but does that make it right? 
Together we pondered what freedom means, what it means to be a citizen, and finally 
a member of the human race. Our conversation was brief and filled with more questions 
than answers. Closure occurred when the young man informed me that he was going 
to spend his time reading some articles I had made available on the topic of white 
privilege. <p>Wednesday when the young man entered the classroom, knowing he would 
never complain about receiving the detention, I inquired if he indeed was being 
punished for not attending the program. He shared that he was and that he had 
been dismissed from the office when he attempted to discuss the issue. I was not 
surprised by the administration's behavior, this was the same administration which 
weeks earlier informed me that I was wasting the administrations time by having 
students identify injustices and develop of plan of action to address the injustice 
based on Thoreau's, &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;. At the end of the class period 
I informed the student that I would also be serving detention with him. <p>It 
needs to be stated clearly, my detention, unlike this student's, was self imposed. 
No one was punishing me for not attending the program. I elected to serve the 
hour of detention and I could do this because I was in a position of power. This 
position of power was part of the reason why I participated in the detention. 
I realized that I could call attention to the irony of this situation, the freedom 
to assemble, in a manner a student could never hope to accomplish. I served the 
detention because I wanted the young man to know that I supported his decision 
to skip the program. I wanted to stand in solidarity with him. I served the detention 
to challenge others to take a stand, to step out and join their brothers and sisters 
who suffer because they are not in positions of power and therefore are oppressed. 
I served the detention because I am convinced that change can come about through 
nonviolent means. <p>At exactly 3:00 p.m. I reported to the designated location 
in order to receive my detention duties. The students reporting to serve detention 
assumed that I was the detention supervisor and refused to accept the explanation 
of why I was present, until the young man stated, &quot;no, he's here with me.&quot; 
With a degree of reluctance the supervising instructor placed me under the guidance 
of the custodian. Again, I was reminded of my position of power as the custodian 
was extremely hesitant to assign any tasks. My first task consisted of collecting 
and emptying the recycling boxes, which was followed by the task of emptying and 
re-bagging the garbage cans. Entering the classrooms of fellow staff members provided 
an opportunity to discuss the events of Tuesday and explain why I needed to serve 
this detention. Some of the teachers responded with a nervous laugh, others confessed 
that they too skipped the program, and some dismissed me as a lunatic as they 
returned to the scholarly work of searching the internet. As we drifted from classroom 
to classroom pushing the oversized garbage bin, I found myself wondering what 
the administration hoped to accomplish by having this young man serve detention. 
Were these sixty minutes of oppression intended to make him appreciate the opportunity, 
the freedom, to assemble? Were the names and memories of dead soldiers suppose 
to fill his thoughts? Was picking gum of the bottom of a garbage can suppose to 
ignite the fire of patriotism in his belly? Or was this to be a simple reminder 
for this young man that you do not have the freedom to question or challenge the 
authority of the administration even though you live in America. The administration 
reported, we have the freedom to assemble, SO, I am ordering you to assemble in 
the name of educational opportunities. <p>At the completion of the hour we reported 
to the supervisor's classroom, recorded the time and initialed all the proper 
squares. As the young man and I passed through the doorway the supervisor asked, 
&quot;will you attend the Veterans Day program in the future?&quot; In union we 
sang, &quot;No.&quot; As I turned and strolled down the hall to the right and 
the young man to the left I thought to myself, they can't force me to assemble 
and they can't stop me from standing in solidarity with another. <p>Because we 
do reside in America, because thousands and thousands of young men and women have 
given their lives, it is time that we practice our freedom and stand with those 
who are oppressed. It is time that we acknowledge our positions of privilege and 
use it for the benefit of others. It is time that we open our mouths to name the 
injustice in our midst. It is time that we dirty our hands in the garbage cans 
of our communities in order to establish a better, cleaner, community for everyone. 
It is time that we serve a detention, or two or three, or...
