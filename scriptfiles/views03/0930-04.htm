<p> "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525947647/commondreams-20" target="_new">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell
Them</a>," the title of Al Franken's book on the
American right, is starting to look less like a
cartoon and more like a description that
could filter into the mainstream. Last week
Senator Edward M. Kennedy surprised his
Senate colleagues by accusing the Bush
team of going to war in Iraq for domestic
political reasons, and deliberately deceiving
the American public.

<p> "There was no imminent threat. This
was made up in Texas, announced in
January to the Republican leadership that
[the war] was going to take place and was
going to be good politically. This whole
thing was a fraud," said Kennedy.

<p>Kennedy's remarks were not the least
bit shocking to the tens of millions of
Americans who have seen through the fraud
from the very beginning. Back in August of
2002, the Democrats were outpolling
Republicans on the economy, the budget,
Social Security, and almost all of the biggest
election issues except "national security and

terrorism." Millions of Americans had lost
much of their retirement savings in a wave
of corporate crime.

<p>Then came the war talk, and soon all
of these issues were out of the headlines. It
worked: the Republicans went on to win
both houses of Congress in November.

<p>The timing was perfect and the
reasons offered for the war turned out to be
fraudulent -- no weapons of mass
destruction, no links between Iraq and
September 11. What more evidence would
anyone need as to why they did it?

<p>Yet Kennedy is the first political
leader with full access to the national media
to state the obvious. Hence the swift and
shrill response from the Republicans, with
House majority leader Tom Delay accusing
Democrats of having "spewed more hateful
rhetoric at President Bush than they ever did
at Saddam Hussein."

<p>The Republicans have reason to be
scared. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll last
week asked voters whether they would
"probably vote for President Bush or
probably vote for the Democratic candidate"
next year: 42 percent chose Bush versus 40
percent for the Democrat. This difference is
statistically insignificant, and was down
from a 52 to 24 percent lead for Bush in
April.

<p> Politicians are schooled in the art of
compromise and cautious speech, especially
in the United States. They often forget that
the unvarnished truth can at times be a
powerful weapon. And this is one of those
times.

<p>There is a part of the electorate,
probably about a third, that already knows
that the Bush team lied about Iraq and
dragged us into this mess for the most
unconscionable of political motives. These
include people who read Paul Krugman in
the New York Times, or use the Internet to
find dozens of other well-informed, even
well-established writers who have made
these arguments persuasively. According to
the New York Times, about 38 percent of the
public have consistently told pollsters they
do not believe that George W. Bush was
legitimately elected president.

<p>Another part, also roughly a third, is
solidly in Bush's corner. These are people
who get their information from Fox News
and actually believe that it is "fair and
balanced." They would support the President
if he invaded Sweden to liberate its people
from the oppression of their welfare state.

<p>It's that other third -- the swing
voters -- that the Bush team is worried
about. According to the most recent polls,
their support for the war is slipping and their
skepticism about President Bush is growing.

<p>Many of these people do not get
much news outside of the major broadcast
media, and therefore have not been exposed
to the strong arguments that Kennedy
brought them last week. If more political
leaders with Kennedy's level of access to the
media were to pick up on these themes, it
could seriously undermine President Bush's
credibility.

<p>Still, the biggest group of swing
voters will probably make their decision on
the basis of the economy. But President
Bush is at least as vulnerable on that front,
as he is poised to become the first president
since Herbert Hoover to preside over a net
loss of jobs during his term.

<p>It's still very early in the game and
the Democrats don't have a candidate yet,
but it seems that this presidential election
will be theirs for the taking. If they have the
courage to take it.
