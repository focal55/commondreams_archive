<p>Conventional wisdom has always been that when the economy soured, Americans would become resentful of immigrants. But here we are in a slowdown, and Americans are hiring more and more of them. 

<p>Researchers at the U.S. Labor Department and the Pew Hispanic Center say that the number of employed foreign-born workers rose by 600,000 from 2000 to 2002. And researchers at the Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies have observed that neither recession nor renewed attention to border security after Sept. 11, 2001, has done much to stem the flow of immigrants. 

<p>Immigrant laborers appeal to many U.S. employers — especially those in agriculture and low-skilled industries — because immigrants will accept wages that many Americans consider insulting. Often, immigrants let employers set the price. When was the last time a plumber let you tell him what you were willing to pay? 

<p>The lure is so great in Pasadena, Calif., that the City Council recently passed an ordinance to stop motorists from picking up day laborers off the street. Violators could get a $271 fine. Contractors who rely on these day laborers told National Public Radio that they would take their chances, claiming that American laborers are just too expensive. 

<p>Then there is the work ethic. Restaurateurs, homebuilders, hotel managers and farmers routinely admit they would rather hire immigrants over the native-born. In fact, they say that sometimes only immigrants show up when jobs are advertised. 

<p>A Texas entrepreneur who has owned several small businesses recently told me about an observation she has made. When natives apply for jobs, she said, the first things they ask about are wages, benefits and vacation. With immigrants, all they ask about is how much work they can get. 

<p>For many employers, the choice is easy. Now, some in Congress want to make it even easier by launching a new guest-worker program. 

<p>That's right. They want to bring back the braceros, the name given to the nearly 5 million Mexican workers imported into the United States from 1942 to 1964. It was only after television journalist Edward R. Murrow revealed the degree to which the braceros were exploited that Congress pulled the government out of the labor procurement business. 

<p>Now, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas wants to get back to business. Eager to match U.S. employers who need workers with foreign laborers who need jobs, Cornyn recently outlined for his Senate colleagues a guest-worker bill he intends to introduce. What Cornyn proposes is a program that issues immigrant workers a "blue card" so they could work in the United States legally for one year — with the option of extending their stay for up to three years. After that, participants must return to their home countries. 

<p>Cornyn says his bill would bring illegal immigrants into the sunlight, preserve homeland security and make it easier to enforce labor and immigration laws. It would also fix what he calls a "broken" immigration system. 

<p>But Cornyn left out the best part. For pro-business politicians in both parties, the main selling point to guest workers is that they represent an affordable dose of corporate welfare intended to free businesses of the obligation to pay decent wages. Although Cornyn envisions that braceros would receive at least the minimum wage and such benefits as worker's compensation, the fact that the workers won't be around long enough to achieve seniority and other benefits means that companies will save a bundle in the long run. 

<p>As for fixing something broken, it is hard to see how a program that might involve perhaps thousands of workers would make a dent on an underground system that law-enforcement officers say brings in over a million immigrants a year. It is also worth noting that the Cornyn plan first draws upon the estimated 8 million to 10 million illegals already living in the United States before beginning to import workers. But why would immigrants who currently pay coyotes as much as $2,000 a head to get here enroll in a program that, after one to three years, sends them home where they must come up with more money to return? And return they will. 

<p>Guest-worker programs should offend our national sensibilities. They designate a class of people and say that they're good enough to pick our crops but not good enough to stick around, buy a home and join the PTA. Besides, the programs never work. You just can't make employers pay the wages and provide the benefits and build the housing necessary to keep workers from being exploited, because doing all that would negate the value of the subsidy. 

<p>If it comes to that, employers might as well do the unthinkable: hire Americans.
