<p> NEVER UNDERESTIMATE the common sense of the American people. According 

to recent polls, early support for an invasion of Iraq is slipping. Most 

Americans agree Saddam Hussein is a monstrous dictator. But with each passing 

month, more people recognize that he is not linked to al Qaeda terrorists. The 

real nuclear threat posed by North Korea has also made some people wonder -- 

in the absence of new evidence -- whether it is Iraq that threatens our 

national security. Finally, some people may realize that it is control over 

Iraq's oil fields that our national leaders covet, not the prospect of 

installing democracy in Iraq.

<P>Never before in human history has an anti-war movement grown so fast and 

spread so quickly. It is even more remarkable because the war has yet to begin.

<P>Publicized throughout cyberspace, the anti-war movement has left behind its 

sectarian roots and entered mainstream culture. To give just a few examples, 

the National Council of Churches, the National Organization for Women, Win 

Without War (Hollywood celebrities), the National Conference of Catholic 

Bishops, John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, and the Sierra Club have all 

voiced their opposition to an invasion of Iraq.

<P>As in the 1960s, Northern California is a pivotal center of the nation's 

anti-war activity. By launching "United For Peace," an ecumenical network of 

coalitions, the San Francisco-based human rights organization Global Exchange 

helped broaden the appeal of the movement. Medea Benjamin, its spirited 

director, also kicked off a national Women's Peace Vigil and rolling fast in 

Lafayette Park, directly across from the White House. Dubbed "Code Pink"(an 

alternative to the government's code orange or red alerts), the peaceful 

protest has already inspired similar vigils and fasts across the country.

<P>As you'd expect, Bay Area students are key players in the movement. On Jan. 

17, as college students gather on the East Coast, San Francisco State 

University will host a "Youth Anti-War Conference" to coordinate college anti-

war activism on the West Coast.

<P>Unlike the Vietnam era, this new movement has also attracted immigrants and 

minorities, some of whose activities are regularly publicized in San 

Francisco's "War Times," a bilingual publication circulated nationwide.

<P>On any given day, you can find ordinary people -- from San Jose to Petaluma 

-- staging weekly vigils at federal buildings, BART stations and public spaces.

<P>Every Sunday, for example, the Lake Merritt Neighbors Organized for Peace 

walk around the lake.

<P>Right now, most Bay Area peace groups are busy preparing for the National 

Marches on Washington and San Francisco that will take place on Jan. 18. The 

marches are expected to draw thousands of people to the nation's capital and 

to our fair city. (More about the national anti-war protests on Thursday.)

<P>Some people, of course, don't wait for marches and, in the inimitable 

tradition of the Bay Area's activism, find their own distinctive way to 

protest the war. In West Marin, for example, 50 women recently disrobed and 

spelled out the word peace with their naked bodies on Love Field in Point 

Reyes. "Beautiful and brave to lay naked in the rain for a just message," 

commented one passer-by.

<P>So far, Bay Area activists have embraced the long and honorable American 

tradition of using peaceful protest and nonviolent civil disobedience to 

express dissent. Nothing could be more important because nothing is less 

persuasive than using violence to protest war.</p>
