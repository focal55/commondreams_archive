<p>If Republicans finally pass their extravagant energy bill this weekend, 
we hope they take a moment to thank the one man who above all others 
will have made it possible: Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.

<p>The cornucopia of special interest energy payoffs slid through the 
House earlier this week but has hit a snag in the Senate. East and West 
Coast liberals complain it lacks conservation measures. A few 
Republicans are appalled by its billions of dollars in new subsidies. 
This unlikely alliance is close to the 41 votes it needs to defeat the 
bill with a filibuster.

<p>Standing in their way is none other than that liberal giant, Mr. 
Daschle, who two days ago endorsed the bill. What has provoked this 
rare burst of bipartisanship? It happens that the South Dakotan is the 
co-author of an enormous new mandate in the bill requiring American 
drivers to more than double the amount of ethanol they buy. Facing a 
tough re-election race next year, the erstwhile prairie populist is 
determined to raise U.S. fuel prices (by $8.5 billion over each of the 
next five years) in order to feed the ethanol lobby. Keep in mind that 
much of this ethanol subsidy goes not to farmers but to giant 
agribusiness companies such as Archer-Daniels-Midland.

<p>As early as July, the Senator was running ads back home promising that 
"Tom Daschle is close to passing new energy legislation that would 
triple ethanol production in South Dakota." And recently the National 
Corn Growers Association and the Renewable Fuels Association (the 
ethanol lobby) made it clear that any Midwest politician who votes against the
bill will get a thorough shucking. Republican energy conference chair Pete
Domenici also twisted the knife this week when he mused publicly that if
this energy bill dies it's impossible to know whether this ethanol
windfall "ever comes back."

<p>We'd love to see the energy bill die, but where are the nation's 
soak-the-rich, anti-big business liberals when you really need them?
