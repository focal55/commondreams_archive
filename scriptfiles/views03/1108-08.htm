<p>Mateo Castillo Gregorio and German Hernandez Reynoso were displaced from their 
homes in Guatemala in the 1980s largely because of a man named Efrain Ríos Montt. 
<p>During his 18 months as dictator of Guatemala after a 1982 coup, Ríos Montt 
ordered the killing and torture of thousands of opposition members. He has been 
charged with genocide and crimes against humanity for overseeing military-backed 
death squads. The death squads operated with impunity during the country's decades-long, 
bloody civil war. <p>Castillo fled to Chiapas, Mexico. Hernandez was displaced 
within Guatemala after his village, Saq Ja, was burned to the ground by the military. 
<p>Now, the two are carrying out the slow work of rebuilding their communities 
and their Mayan identities, both suppressed by years of violence and fear. They 
are members of a group called Centro Maya de Cultura y Desarollo (Mayan Center 
of Culture and Development). Supported financially and logistically by Christian 
Guatemalan Action, the Centro carries out a host of community and social programs 
in Saq Ja and other local communities. These include a women's group, nutritional 
information programs, educational programs and health promotion programs, all 
with a focus on Mayan spirituality and decision-making processes. <p>But as they 
rebuild, the man who played such a large role in the destruction and displacement 
of more than 400 Mayan communities in Guatemala is poised to return to power. 
<p>In order to run in the November 9 elections, Montt and his supporters had to 
pressure Congress and the judiciary. Guatemala's constitution forbids ex-dictators 
from running for office, but Montt argued that this constitutional clause, active 
since 1985, is not retroactive and therefore cannot apply to his time in office. 
By all indications, Montt will be a major contender in the election this Sunday. 
<p>Ríos Montt's campaign is shadowed by a violent past and present. On July 24-25, 
about 5,000 Ríos Montt supporters were bused into Guatemala City, where they rioted 
in the streets, attacked journalists, and closed down government offices. They 
were demanding that the Supreme Court allow Montt to run for president despite 
his record. <p>"This is a delicate situation," understates Castillo. "One of the 
presidential candidates is also one of those who committed atrocities during the 
Civil War. It is creating a situation where we again have violence, kidnappings, 
threats against human rights activists. There have been attacks against women 
in the capital--we're finding the raped and mutilated bodies of women. There are 
threats against people who talk against Ríos Montt. It's a tense situation." <p>Over 
the past year, Ríos Montt has mobilized thousands of peasants and former "guards"--paramilitaries 
who supported his and other reigns of terror in the past--to demonstrate in his 
favor. These former death squad members are also demanding back pay for their 
time served as "security guards" in service of the government. <p>While it might 
seem strange that the very peasants who were the victims of oppression and terror 
under Rios Montt and other military dictatorships over the years would now support 
him, he has been effective in buying them off with small bribes of money, food 
and trinkets. <p>"If Ríos Montt wins, we believe the situation we had in the past 
will return," said Hernandez, 41, who has six kids. "We don't know what we'll 
do." <p>As in most of Latin America, globalization and free trade policies have 
led to an increased divided between rich and poor in Guatemala. Many see Ríos 
Montt capitalizing on this misery to gain support among rural and poor farmers. 
<p>"The millionaires have the power to do anything, and we're just fighting to 
survive," said Hernandez. <p>Castillo noted that Guatemala has directly suffered 
from NAFTA, the controversial North American Free Trade Agreement that was instituted 
in 1994, even though it doesn't technically include Guatemala. "There are very 
visible effects of globalization and neoliberalism," he said. "[Under NAFTA] the 
U.S. has commercially flooded Mexico with cheap products like corn. So since Mexican 
farmers don't have a market there anymore, they flood our country with corn and 
sell it here at cheaper prices [than local corn]. So for many Guatemalans it's 
not even worth it to plant seeds anymore." <p>Castillo, 40, noted that it is ironic 
that now the U.S. government is speaking against Ríos Montt and his cohorts, considering 
that during the Civil War the CIA and other government entities actively supported 
the military and paramilitary death squads in their fight against supposed "communism." 
<p>In fact, on December 4, 1982, President Ronald Reagan met with Ríos Montt and 
described him as a "man of great personal integrity and commitment" who had been 
"getting a bum rap." Just three days later, forensic anthropologists discovered 
that Ríos Montt's military had slaughtered more than 300 people in the village 
of Dos Erres. <p>"Then the U.S. supported him, but now they don't," Castillo said. 
"It's a matter of what's convenient for them. During Guatemala's civil war, the 
U.S. helped perpetuate massacres there. Now the U.S. presence is more in the economic 
realm. These U.S. businesses and transnational businesses are looking for ways 
to exploit our country's natural resources, to make the poor poorer and the rich 
richer. This is globalization and free trade. It has very big effects on the community." 
<p>Along with the Mayan communities, the environment has also been taking a beating 
from the increased industrialization of the country by foreign investors. "If 
we don't respect the natural resources of the planet, we'll be destroyed," Castillo 
said. "Industry in Guatemala destroys the environment. There are mountains of 
trash everywhere, there are pesticides being used here that are banned in the 
U.S. The campesinos use them because they don't know any better." <p>Castillo 
and Hernandez were in Chicago for three weeks in October as part of a program 
with the Chicago-Guatemala Return Project, an organization that is an outgrowth 
of the Sanctuary movement of the 1980s, when U.S. churches gave respite to people 
fleeing oppression and violence in Central America. The goal of the Return Project 
is to rebuild communities including Saq Ja which were destroyed during the war. 
<p>Hernandez and Castillo hope that by spreading their message in Chicago, U.S. 
residents will become more aware of the situation in Guatemala, and more aware 
of their government's role in international economics and in supporting leaders 
like Ríos Montt. <p>"We've been happy to find that there is resistance against 
these policies in the U.S.," said Castillo. "What gives us hope is that we can 
join in resistance together."</p><p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; 1995-2003 Resource Center
