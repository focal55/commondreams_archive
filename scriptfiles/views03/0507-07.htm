<p>The hot topic in military affairs this week is missile defense, a largely invisible weapons system designed to counter a mostly hypothetical threat. But I'd rather talk about cluster munitions, which are utterly real and deadly beyond question.

<p>I'd call them cluster bombs, a simpler and more graphic term. But it seems that in Pentagon warspeak, if something is fired from a cannon as opposed to being dropped from the air, it doesn't qualify as a bomb. And many of the devastating sprays of bomblets used by U.S. forces in Iraq were -- as they used to say about Puffed Wheat -- shot from guns.

<p>Cluster munitions are the spam of modern warfare, scattering devastation over a wide area. There are many types, but all follow the same principle. A shell opens about 200 feet above the ground and sprays 200 to 300 bomblets over an area the size of a football field or two. The bomblets, also known as "submunitions," are about the size of a soft drink can. Each packs enough explosive to pierce armour -- or kill several human beings.

<p>The Pentagon has acknowledged dropping 1,500 bombs on Iraq, of which it says 26 fell on civilian areas. It has not provided figures on artillery-fired cluster munitions.

<p>Cluster weapons are not outlawed by international treaties or conventions. Yet, over the past few decades, they have caused extensive suffering to civilians -- notably in the 1991 Persian Gulf war and in Afghanistan.

<p>Failure rates in the 10-per-cent to 20-per-cent range mean unexploded bomblets lie around waiting to be picked up by children or stepped on by adults. Two watchdog groups, Human Rights Watch and Mines Action Canada, want a moratorium on the use of cluster weapons declared while their consequences are assessed. They are not calling for an outright ban.

<p>In general, military tactics are considered inhumane if they cause harm indiscriminately to civilians as well as combatants. So in a macabre paradox, the more effective these weapons can be made in the military sense, the weaker the argument will be for halting their use. The latest generation -- tested, in effect, on Iraqis -- includes bomblets with sensors to help them find individual targets, and self-deactivation mechanisms. Reports on their performance are eagerly awaited.

<p>For the moment, says Paul Hannon, executive director of Mines Action Canada, "it's much too early to say that improved technology is actually going to reduce the danger."

<p>But enough. Where weapons are concerned, it's easy to get bogged down in tech talk. Let's listen to some of the cluster-bomb stories recorded by foreign reporters in Iraq over the past few days.

<p>From Nasiriyah: Five-year-old Hala Hassan and her two-year-old brother, Ali, are ripped by shrapnel after a bomblet they are playing with in their front yard explodes. Three neighbour boys, aged 7 to 14, died the previous day.

<p>From Baghdad: Rashid Majid, two of his sons and a third man are killed after they pick up unexploded bomblets. Their street was littered with the weapons after a U.S. attack. A U.S. Army captain says artillerymen overshot when firing at Iraqi anti-aircraft guns. "It's just tragic," he observes.

<p>From Najaf: Hospital director Safa al-Amaidi says that cluster-bomb shrapnel killed 35 civilians in a single night, and that the weapons were responsible for most postwar casualties.

<p>From Mosul: Thirteen-year-old Jassen Muhammad's hand is amputated after he picks up a bomblet lying in the mud.

<p>Cluster bombs are not the only leftover munitions killing and maiming Iraqis. Saddam Hussein's regime left the country studded with weapons dumps. Thousands of artillery shells lie unexploded; children are picking them up and playing with them, too. And the United States is not the only country using cluster munitions in modern warfare. Others include British forces in Iraq (who have been more forthcoming with details than the Pentagon) and NATO allies in the Balkans.

<p>But the Americans led the mission to Iraq. They invoked humanitarian goals, and they promised to do everything they could to minimize civilian casualties. We heard ad nauseam from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld about the supposed care taken to achieve pinpoint accuracy. Yet U.S. forces repeatedly used a weapon with an unacceptable failure rate, knowing it was about as precise as confetti in front of a fan.

<p>Under George W. Bush, the United States is pursuing an explicit policy of overwhelming, perpetual military superiority. If there is a moral defense for that, it would seem to rest largely on the promise to use the resulting power wisely and humanely. Forswearing the use of these child-killing weapons would be a good place to start.
