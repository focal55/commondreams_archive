<p>The invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces seems more and more imminent. One senses a certain passivity. Could it be that, 30 years after Vietnam, too many relate to war more in the mode of spectator?</p>

<p>One thing has become abundantly clear: Our country's embarkation on new hostilities with Iraq is essentially a moral question. It is the moral dimension of the issue that weighs most heavily on people's minds.</p>

<p>Will an upcoming war with Iraq be a just war? My own sources of information, my faith tradition, the communications of authoritative spokespersons in my church, my own sense of the impact of Scriptural teaching on our times, my examination of the writings of economists, military leaders, international analysts, Middle Eastern experts - all of these lead me to believe that our invasion of Iraq would not fulfill just-war criteria. In fact, all of these lead me to believe that in the short run an invasion will be unwise, and in the long run a dangerous bequeathing of insecurity to our nation's children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>But there is another crucially important question - not so much a question of content, but one of process. It is a crucial question for every citizen of a democracy. Will the bombs that are dropped on Iraq be dropped in my name?</p>

<p>The phrasing of this question could seem rhetorical. But, in the end, it is the type of question that meets the vision of our nation's founders. Citizen involvement is preferable in every issue, but when the issue is war, citizen involvement is indispensable.</p>

<p>I would like to propose a process. It could be called a process of nonpassivity. It is nothing new, nothing elaborate, but simply this: Let every citizen of the United States consider writing one of three possible letters to the President or to their congresspersons. The first possible letter could be one of support for a war in Iraq. One could condition it on certain circumstances, but in the end, it would be a letter of support. The second letter would be a letter of unknowing. That is, people may feel at a loss; they would not be able to come to a conviction either way. The third possible letter would be one that clearly opts for no war. It would request that, if bombs are dropped, they are not to be dropped "in my name."</p>

<p>This process is a way to break through apathy. It invites everyone to shoulder the moral burden of a citizen. One caution: You should not feel you have to be an expert to state an opinion. We think and feel as the people we are. That is what democracy is; that is what moral responsibility is. That is the moral burden of a citizen of a democracy.</p>
