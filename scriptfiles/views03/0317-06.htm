<p>The emperor has spoken. Let the world take heed.



<p>Mark the date: March 16, 2003. It will go down in history as the day our

new Caesar crossed his personal Rubicon. Bush's twin ultimata, to Iraq and 

to the United Nations, constituted the final and ultimate declaration of

the new New World Order.

<p>The first formal declaration was in his speech to Congress on September 20, 

2001. "Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you 

are with us, or you are with the terrorists." The open implication was that 

the rule of law, already honored mostly in the breach, was to be replaced 

by the rule of force; that force, naturally, to emanate from Washington.

<p>Over the 1.5 years since then, there have been numerous reaffirmations

-- 

the launching of the pre-emption doctrine, the warning to the UN that if it 

didn't do America's bidding it would make itself "irrelevant" -- but it was 

always possible to imagine that even this reckless administration might be 

turned back, might at least at least generate an illusion of a velvet glove 

in which to cloak its iron fist.

<p>No more. Bush's declaration was crafted to lock in the insane and 

potentially suicidal course that the administration has taken ever since

the attacks of 9/11.

<p>What was really shocking and terrifying was not simply the effective 

declaration of war against Iraq; it has been a foregone conclusion for at 

least six months that, in the absence of overwhelming opposition, the war 

would happen. Rather, it was the way the ultimatum was delivered. To give 

Iraq 24 hours to "disarm" (even while Dick Cheney and Colin Powell make the 

rounds of talk TV saying there is no longer a way for Iraq to comply) is

openly farcical. An administration that took a year after 9/11 before it

instituted widespread X-raying of checked bags might be expected to 

understand this. To give the Security Council 24 hours to pass a resolution 

is a naked imperial imposition.

<p>It is an ultimatum designed not to elicit any response, but rather to 

humiliate.

<p>It is also perhaps worth commenting on the stunningly open mendacity of the 

Bush administration, continued with Bush's ultimatum yesterday. To make 

this declaration on the 15th anniversary of the gassing of Halabja, to 

mention it specifically, is a profound insult not just to the Iraqi people 

but to all of us; where is the mention that the United States supported 

Iraq fully at the time, with biological and chemical materials, loan 

guarantees, and diplomatic cover? That it went so far as to issue organized 

disinformation (<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0117-01.htm" target="_new">http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0117-01.htm</a>)

suggesting 

that Iran was the culprit? To mention Rwanda as an example of the "failure" 

of the UN was possibly even worse. Again, where was the mention that the UN 

"failed" because the United States kept UN peacekeepers from being 

reinforced, cut off their supplies, and pushed ceaselessly to have them 

removed? Or the mention that the State Department deliberately covered up 

<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB53/press.html" target="_new">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB53/press.html</a>) its clear 

knowledge that what was happening was genocide?

<p>Indeed, it is again as if these references were added simply to display 

flagrant contempt for the rest of the world, which may know the truth but 

consistently feels unable to express it because of the weight of U.S. coercion.

<p>And perhaps the most important lie was the reference to France. France has 

"shown its cards" and "said they were going to veto anything that held 

Saddam to account" -- this right on the heels of Chirac's effective 

surrender by agreeing to a 30-day deadline for disarmament.

<p>This was is much bigger than a war on Iraq. It is a gauntlet hurled in the 

face of France and the rest of "old Europe." It is a frontal assault on the 

concept of democracy worldwide. It is, if you look at the planning 

documents (<a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org" target="_new">http://www.newamericancentury.org</a>) of the neoconservatives who 

now run our foreign policy, the first stage in a long campaign against China.

<p>Yesterday, Bush drew the battle lines through the entire globe and through 

the middle of each country. In order even to begin to understand how to 

oppose this new imperialism, we must understand this: weapons of mass 

destruction have nothing to do with this war, and even Iraq itself has to 

do with this war only in the sense that it is a strategic prize. This war 

is a small part of an ongoing attempt to reshape the world.

<p>The target of this war is not Iraq. The target is the entire world order, 

and Iraq is simply collateral damage.
