<p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg held a news conference on September 9th 
which was described by the New York Post this way:  "Looking more like a 
pitchman than a politician, the mayor bought an orange-mango juice drink 
from a Snapple machine, opened it and took a sip."
<p>In so doing, the Mayor's common sense snapped, as he committed New 
York City unilaterally to naming Snapple as the official water, juice 
and iced tea provider for the nation's largest metropolis.  The 
elaborate five-year agreement -- not publically available -- transferred 
$166 million from Snapple to the City in return for exclusive selling 
rights of these and other products in the public schools and public 
buildings.  Snapple's logo is to go on ferries and garbage cans.
<p>About forty million dollars of this sum would go to the Schools and 
the rest to the city's general budget.  Snapple won the selection 
contest over seven other beverage sellers which the Mayor refused to name.
<p>The City's chief marketing officer (that's his title) said that the 
Snapple agreement was both "relevant" and "tasteful".  The Mayor flagged 
the future of selling New York City without asking its citizens: "This 

agreement is the first in a limited number of high-quality partnerships 
that we think will greatly enhance our efforts to promote and market New 
York City," he enthused.
<p>Old-timers years ago would have wondered what the Mayor means by 
marketing New York City.  Cities were viewed more benignly when they 
were more livable, more employable at good wages, more replete with 
public institutions like good libraries, good public transit, good 
schools, good hospitals and clinics and good recreational facilities in 
the neighborhoods. New York City is crumbling on these measurements.  
<p>Its officials, including the Mayor, cannot even protect its poor 
children from the chronic, brain and body damaging lead-based paint 
poisoning in ageing tenements.  But he can provide them with Snapple 
drinks of dubious nutritional quality and water in the vending 
machines.  Water???  New York City has regularly tested as delivering 
about the finest water of any city in the country, according to 
Consumers Union.  The schools' water coolers dispense it.
<p>Obviously in this age of over-weening corporate commercialism and 
the placement of their executives in public office, marketing New York 
City means partnerships that promote products.  What's next?    Mayor 
Bloomberg isn't saying.  Let's guess.  Will New York City have its 
official cars, sports equipment, jeans, sneakers, computers, colas, hot 
dogs, pens and cereal?  And what intriguing new areas for corporate 
logos will be made available?  In his fervent quest for budget dollars 
(never mind the massive tax abatements the City has given to 
corporations), Mayor Bloomberg might want to make City Hall and his own 
backside available.  Imagine what price a huge banner for GM or Apple 
Computer in front of City Hall will fetch year after year?
<p>Unlike his uncanny ability to think through the demand for financial 
information that marked the rise of his Bloomberg communications Empire, 
the Mayor has not thought through the slippery slope that the City is 
now on.
<p>Giving a company a monopoly over certain products sold to the City 
means preventing better products from superior competitors coming along 
to demonstrate what free enterprise means.  What will happen if your 
designated monopolist -- say Snapple -- or its parent conglomerate 
Cadbury-Schweppes (a British company) gets into trouble with the law -- 
a criminal conviction, an Enron type scandal, a covered-up product 
defect?  Does thesecret agreement with Snapple have an "out" clause?  
Who pays to remove the stigmatized company logos and signs all over the 
Big Apple?
<p>What happens when the City government is wrestling with a policy 
that affects vending machine products?  Will Snapple appear to have 
special influence in the Mayor's administration?  Will the Mayor avoid 
doing the right thing for consumers because of some provision in the 
Snapple agreement that immunizes the company from some later public policy?
<p>Already, the Snapple deal is making otherwise adult politicians look 
foolish.  Mayor Bloomberg, according to the New York Times, announced 
the agreement "on the athletic field at John F. Kennedy High School in 
the Bronx, with a bright-orange Snapple vending machine and the high 
school's football team standing behind him."  The Mayor said:  "Given 
the global popularity of Snapple products, this will present the city 
with countless new opportunities to make positive impressions on people 
around the world"  So reassuring!
<p>What happens when people and students take issue, as they surely 
will, with Snapple's president's blanket statement that "New York City 
loves Snapple," and start rebelling against this fiat by City Hall, 
start wearing t-Shirts in school saying awful things about Snapple, 
boycotting the products, examining the contents of the drinks and 
showing that commercialism and public government do not mix.  Who will 
Mayor Bloomberg's props be then?
