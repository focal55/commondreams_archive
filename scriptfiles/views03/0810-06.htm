<p>In Thursday's Washington Post, Condoleeza Rice, the President's National 
Security Advisor, writes the following: 
<p>"Our task is to work with those in the Middle East who seek progress 
toward greater democracy, tolerance, prosperity and freedom. As 
President Bush said in February, ‘The world has a clear interest in the 
spread of democratic values, because stable and free nations do not 
breed ideologies of murder. They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a 
better life.'" 
<p>Now, if we only had a nickel for every time Bush, or Rice, or Colin 
Powell, or Paul Wolfowitz or Dick Cheney or Richard Perle or Donald 
Rumsfeld talked about bringing democracy to the Middle East. 
<p>Talk, talk, talk. 
<p>Here's something you can bet on: Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz will not hold a 
press conference this month to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
U.S.-led coup of the democratically elected leader of Iran -- Mohammed Mossadegh. 
<p>Rice and Powell won't hold a press conference to celebrate Operation 
Ajax, the CIA plot that overthrew the Mossadegh. 
<p>That was 50 years ago this month, in August 1953. 
<p>That's when Mossadegh was fed up with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company -- 
now BP -- pumping Iran's oil and shipping the profits back home to the 
United Kingdom. 
<p>And Mossadegh said -- hey, this is our oil, I think we'll keep it. 
<p>And Winston Churchill said -- no you won't. 
<p>Mossadegh nationalized the company -- the way the British were 
nationalizing their own vital industries at the time. 
<p>But what's good for the UK ain't good for Iran. 
<p>If you fly out of Dulles Airport in Virginia, ever wonder what the word 
Dulles means? 
<p>It stands for the Dulles family -- Secretary of State John Foster Dulles 
and his brother, the CIA director, Allen Dulles. 
<p>They were responsible for the overthrow of the democratically elected 
leader of Iran. 

<p>As was President Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Kermit Roosevelt, the 
CIA agent who traveled to Iran to pull off the coup. 
<p>Now why should we be concerned about a coup that happened so far away 
almost 50 years ago this month? 

<p>New York Times reporter Stephen Kinzer puts it this way: 

<p>"It is not far-fetched to draw a line from Operation Ajax through the 
Shah's repressive regime and the Islamic revolution to the fireballs 
that engulfed the World Trade Center in New York." 

<p>Kinzer has written a remarkable new book, All the Shah's Men: An 
American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror (Wiley, 2003). 

<p>In it, he documents step by step, how Roosevelt, the Dulles boys and 
Norman Schwarzkopf Sr., among a host of others, took down a 
democratically elected regime in Iran. 

<p>They had freedom of the press. We shut it down. 

<p>They had democracy. And we crushed it. 

<p>Mossadegh was the beacon of hope for the Middle East. 

<p>If democracy were allowed to take hold in Iran, it probably would have 
spread throughout the Middle East. 

<p>We asked Kinzer – what does the overthrow of Mossadegh say about the 
United States respect for democracy abroad? 

<p>"Imagine today what it must sound like to Iranians to hear American 
leaders tell them -- ‘We want you to have a democracy in Iran, we 
disapprove of your present government, we wish to help you bring 
democracy to your country.' Naturally, they roll their eyes and say -- 
"We had a democracy once, but you crushed it,'" he said. "This shows how 
differently other people perceive us from the way we perceive ourselves. 
We think of ourselves as paladins of democracy. But actually, in Iran, 
we destroyed the last democratic regime the country ever had and set 
them on a road to what has been half a century of dictatorship." 

<p>After ousting Mossadegh, the United States put in place a brutal Shah 
who destroyed dissent and tortured the dissenters. 

<p>And the Shah begat the Islamic revolution. 

<p>During that Islamic revolution in 1979, Iranians held up Mossadegh's 
picture, telling the world  – we want a democratic regime that resists 
foreign influence and respects the will of the Iranian people as 
expressed through democratic institutions. 

<p>"They were never able to achieve that. And this has led many Iranians to 
react very poignantly to my book," Kaizer told us. "One woman sent me an 
e-mail that said – ‘I was in tears when I finished your book because it 
made me think of all we lost and all we could have had.'" 

<p>Of course, the overthrow of Mossadegh was only one of the first U.S. 
coups of democratically elected regime. (To see one in movie form, pick 
up a copy of Raoul Peck's Lumumba, now on DVD.) 

<p>Kinzer's previous books include Bitter Fruit: The Story of the American 
Coup in Guatemala. 

<p>He's thinking of putting together a boxed set of his books on American coups. 

<p>Get copies of Bitter Fruit and All The Shah's Men. 

<p>Read them. 

<p>And the next time a politician talks about spreading democracy around 
the globe, ask them about Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran, Patrice Lumumba in 
the Congo, and Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala.
