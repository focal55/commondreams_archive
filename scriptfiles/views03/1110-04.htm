<p>NO ONE CAN accuse Michael Lerner of thinking small. Twenty-seven years ago, the Harvard and Yale university-trained political scientist left a promising academic career to found Commonweal, a health and environmental research institute in Bolinas. Since then, Commonweal has earned an international reputation and Lerner received the MacArthur Prize in 1983. 
<p>Now, without great fanfare, Lerner has quietly become one of the catalysts of a national movement dedicated to improving our environmental health. In March 2003, he and a group of colleagues founded the Collaborative on Health and the Environment at the San Francisco Medical Society. 
<p>In the last 20 months, CHE has drawn together patients, health professionals, scientists and environmental health and environmental justice advocates who are concerned with how exposure to environmental contaminants affects our health. 
<p>Lerner speaks softly, even modestly. But there is nothing modest about his vision for CHE. "The essential premise of CHE," he told me, "is that all people whose lives have been affected by environmental contaminants share a common experience -- in a sense, a common wound -- and therefore share a common interest in preventing the diseases and disorders that result from these exposures." 
<p>According to Lerner, CHE has initiated "a series of careful discussions about the strengths and limitations of the scientific evidence that links environmental contaminants with a surprisingly large number of diseases and disorders, some of which have epidemic proportions in industrial countries." (The state of that dialogue can be found on the CHE science Web site, www.protectingourhealth.org.) 
<p>The 151 organizations and 533 indivi-duals who have joined the collaborative -- which includes such diverse groups as the California Academy of Family Physicians, the Institute for Children's Environmental Health, the West Oakland Asthma Coalition, the American Lung Associations of California, Massachusetts and Washington, and the Breast Cancer Fund -- subscribe to CHE's commitment to rigorous science, science education and its precautionary approach to public health. 
<p>They also support bio-monitoring to identify the chemical "body burden'' carried by Americans, and health tracking as an important way to evaluate the prevalence of diseases associated with exposure to contaminants. 
<p>But CHE is more than the sum of its parts. It has the potential to change our public policies and practices. Right now, CHE offers a safe space for partners to ask tough questions of conventional wisdom and to propose new directions for scientific research. 
<p>With its emphasis on environmental health, however, CHE also has the potential to cross racial, class and gender boundaries. It addresses, for example, the toxic dangers faced by poor and minority communities, which have created environmental justice organizations across the country. It also focuses on specific diseases that affect men, women and children. 
<p>On Nov. 15, CHE will hold its first national conference to which both the public and health professionals are invited. The purpose of the conference -- co-sponsored by Commonweal, Physicians for Social Responsibility, the San Francisco Medical Society, and the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health at UCSF -- is to provide updates on some of the best science on environmental health. Dr. Phil Lee, who chairs CHE and was formerly an assistant secretary of health, will be among those who speak about medicine and the environment. 
<p>Don't be surprised if one day we all look back and realize that the 21st century movement for environmental health had it roots right here in the Bay Area. The free conference will be held at Cole Hall at UCSF from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.cheforhealth.org" target="_new">www.cheforhealth.org</a>.
