<p>If Al Franken ran for president, I'd vote for him. <p>True, Franken has never 
held public office, although he did write a book speculating on the kind of president 
he would be, "Why Not Me? The Inside Story of the Making and Unmaking of the Franken 
Presidency." He wins my vote on the basis of his latest book, "Lies and the Lying 
Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right." <p>No other Democrat, 
including those seeking the nomination for president, articulates so well what 
is happening to people under the George W. Bush administration with the blessing 
of not only the right-wing fomenters on TV and radio, but of the so-called mainstream 
media, which Franken accuses of benign neglect. <p>He imagines the media saying 
of Bush, "He doesn't know! Leave the man alone, he doesn't know!" <p>Franken is 
a comedian who first came to national attention as a cast member of "Saturday 
Night Live," where he introduced the character Stuart Smalley, whose affirming 
mantra is, "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!" 
<p>But it is in the realm of politics that Franken has made his biggest contribution. 
His book, "Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations" hit the New 
York Times bestseller list at a time when the list was dominated by hard-core 
conservatives like Limbaugh competing for the unofficial title of "World's Biggest 
Clinton Hater." <p>In "Lying Liars," Franken exposes the exaggerations, distortions 
and outright lies of Ann Coulter, author of anti-liberal tracts such as "Slander" 
and "Treason" (Franken titles the Coulter chapter "Nutcase"), of Bill O'Reilly 
(or Bill O'Lie-lly, as Franken calls him) and Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel, 
of Jerry Falwell, and ultimately of Bush himself. <p>You still don't believe Bush 
lies? Read Franken's chapter, "My Personal Search for Weapons of Mass Destruction," 
or the chapter titled, "By Far the Vast Majority of My Tax Cuts to Those at the 
Bottom," or take Franken's "No Child Left Behind Standardized Test" which reveals 
Bush's education policy for the fraud that it is. <p>Sample question: <p>Q. In 
the No Child Left Behind Act, Congress authorized a $5.6 billion increase in Title 
One spending for low-income children. However, President Bush budgeted only $1 
billion for Title One. If Title One Calls for $2,800 per poverty level student, 
how many children are left behind? <p>a. 0 <p>b. 1 <p>c. 7 <p>d. 1,643,857 <p>You 
get the idea. <p>Fox News Channel, reportedly at the urging of an incensed O'Reilly, 
foolishly sued Franken and attempted to stop the publication of his book on the 
grounds that the subtitle, "A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right," infringed 
on Fox's trademarked slogan, "fair and balanced." <p>In court papers submitted 
to a federal judge in Manhattan, Fox News described Franken as "a parasite," who 
appeared shrill, unstable and "increasingly unfunny." <p>Franken had the last 
laugh - literally. U.S. District Judge Denny Chin threw out the suit, telling 
Fox News it had to learn to take a joke. And publicity over the lawsuit nudged 
his book to the top of the best-seller list. <p>Franken's book is one of several 
that have broken the stranglehold conservatives hold on the political book market. 
See "Dude, Where's My Country?" by Michael Moore, "Bushwhacked" by Molly Ivins 
and Lou Dubose, "The Great Unraveling" by Paul Krugman, "The Lies of George W. 
Bush" by David Corn, "Thieves in High Places" by Jim Hightower and the just-published 
paperback "The Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq" by Christopher Scheer, 
Lakshmi Chaudry and Robert Scheer. <p>Like the Howard Beale character in the movie, 
"Network," Franken is mad as hell, and he's not going to take it anymore. He likes 
to quote the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who died in a plane 
crash before the 2002 election, as saying, "It's not enough just to believe in 
something: You have to work, and the future belongs to the people who are passionate 
and do the work." <p>Franken is nothing if not passionate about politics. When 
Rich Lowry, an editor at the National Review, told a group of college Republicans 
that Democrats had "feminized" politics by making it OK for politicians to cry, 
Franken called him up. <p>"I saw you on C-SPAN last night talking about how we 
Democrats had sissified politics," Franken said. "So, I thought I'd challenge 
you to a fight." <p>"A fight?" Lowry said, sputtering. "Where would we fight?" 
<p>"In my parking garage," Franken said. <p>"What would the rules be?" <p>"No 
rules . . . The first to say 'uncle' loses." <p>After taking a day to think about 
it, Lowry decided that fighting Franken in a parking garage - or anywhere else, 
for that matter - "is just something I don't want to do." <p>Now, if only one 
of the Democrats running for president would offer to go 10 rounds with Bush.
