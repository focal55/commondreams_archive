<p>George W. Bush's grandfather helped finance the Nazi Party.  Karl Rove's 
 grandfather allegedly helped run the Nazi Party, and helped build the Birkenau 
 Death Camp.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's Austrian father volunteered for the infamous 
 Nazi SA and became a ranking officer.   
<p>
 Together, they have destabilized California and are on the brink of bringing 
 it a new Reich.  With the Schwarzenegger candidacy they have laid siege to 
 America's largest state, lining it up for the 2004 election. 
<p>
 The Bush family ties to the Nazi party are well known.  In their 1994 Secret 
 War Against the Jews, Mark Aarons and John Loftus use official US documents to 
 establish that George Herbert Walker, George W. Bush's maternal 
 great-grandfather, was one of Hitler's most important early backers.  He funneled money to 
 the rising young fascist through the Union Banking Corporation. 
<p>
 In 1926, Walker arranged to have his new son-in-law, Prescott Bush---father 
 of President George Bush I, grandfather of George Bush II---hired as Vice 
 President at W.A. Harriman and Company. Prescott became a senior partner when 
 Harriman merged with a British-American investment company to become Brown Brothers 
 Harriman.  In 1934 Prescott Bush joined the Board of Directors of Union 
 Banking. 
<p>
 The bank helped Hitler rise to power.  It also helped him wage war.  As late 
 as July 31, 1941---well after the Nazi invasion of Poland---the U.S. 
 government froze $3 million in Union Banking assets linked to Fritz Thyssen.  Thyssen 
 was noted in the American press as a "German industrialist and original backer 
 of Adolph Hitler." 
<p>
 Loftus writes that Thyssen's "American friends in New York City [were] 
 Prescott Bush and Herbert Walker, the father and father-in-law of a future President 
 of the United States." That would be the current president's father, George 
 Herbert Walker Bush, also the former CIA director. 
<p>
 On October 20, 1942, the U.S. government ordered the seizure of Nazi 
 Germany's banking operations in New York City, which were under the direction of 
 Prescott Bush. The government seized control of Union Banking Corporation under the 
 Trading with the Enemy Act. The liquidation yielded a reported $750,000 
 apiece for Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker. The book, The Splendid Blonde 
 Beast: Money, Law and Genocide, goes into exhaustive detail on Bush-Harriman 
 Nazi money laundering. More recently, Michael Kranish covers the same Bush-Nazi 
 relationships in The Rise of the Bush Family Dynasty published in the Boston 
 Globe. Loftus documents that "Prescott Bush knowingly served as a money 
 launderer for the Nazis. Remember that Union Bank's books and accounts were frozen by 
 the U.S. Alien Property Custodian in 1942 and not released back to the Bush 
 family until 1951." 
<p>
 Often ignored are the Bush family's post-World War II dealings with former 
 Nazis.  John Foster Dulles, who had worked with the Bush family in the Harriman 
 Company in laundering money for Nazi Germany, was Dwight Eisenhower's 
 Secretary of State.  His brother Allen became CIA director. 
<p>
 As Martin Lee documents in The Beast Reawakens, American intelligence 
 recruited numerous top Nazis to spy on the Soviets during the Cold War. Many 
 established connections to the Bush family that had helped finance their original rise 
 to power. In 1988 Project Censored, in its top award, noted "how the major 
 mass media ignored, overlooked or undercovered at least ten critical stories 
 reported in America's alternative press that raised serious questions about the 
 Republican candidate, George Bush, dating from his reported role as a CIA 
 'asset' in 1963 to his presidential campaign's connection with a network of 
 anti-Semites with Nazi and fascist affiliations in 1988." Investigative reporter Russ 
 Bellant established ties between the Republican Party and former Axis Nazis 
 and fascists. 
<p>
 In 2000 and 2001 the Columbus Alive published a series of articles 
 documenting further links between Bush, Sr. and the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his own 
 fascist networks in Japan and Korea. 
<p>
 Karl Rove has parallel ties.  The shadowy Rove serves as "Bush's Brain" in 
 the current White House.  He is the political mastermind behind the California 
 coup, and is now in the headlines for outing Valerie Plame, the CIA wife of 
 Ambassador Joseph Wilson.  A consummate strategist, Rove may have outed Plame in 
 retaliation for Wilson's failure to back up the Bush claim that Saddam Hussein 
 was buying nuclear weapons materials in Africa.  According to some published 
 reports, as many as seventy CIA operatives have been put at risk by Rove's 
 retaliatory strike.   
<p>
 According to Wilson, and to Retired U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Al Martin 
 (www.almartinraw.com), Rove's grandfather was Karl Heinz Roverer, the Gauleiter of 
 Oldenburg.  Roverer was Reich-Statthalter---Nazi State Party Chairman---for his 
 region.  He was also a partner and senior engineer in the Roverer Sud-Deutche 
 Ingenieurburo A. G. engineering firm, which built the Birkenau death camp, at 
 which tens of thousands of Jews, Gypsies, dissidents and other were 
 slaughtered en masse. 
<p>
 Rove, who has been based in Utah and associated with the Mormon Church, is 
 widely viewed as the chief engineer of the current Bush administration.  He and 
 Tom DeLay are attempting to force the Texas legislature to redistrict its 
 Congressional delegations, adding seven sure seats to the Republican column.  By 
 controlling the state houses in New York, Florida, Texas and California, the 
 GOP would have a lock on the four largest states in the union, and thus the 
 ability to manipulate vote counts and strip voter registration rolls in the run-up 
 to the 2004 election.   
<p>
 Rove is a prime behind-the-scenes mover in the Schwarzenegger campaign.  On 
 May 1, 1939, a year after the Nazis took control of Schwarzenegger's native 
 Austria, his father Gustav, voluntarily joined Hilter's infamous Strumabteilung 
 (SA), "brown shirt" stormtroopers.  This was just six months after the brown 
 shirts played a key role in the bloody Kristallnacht attacks on Germany's Jewish 
 community. 
<p>
 The Vienna daily Der Standard noted recently that "Gustav, a high-ranking 
 Nazi, brought up the bespectacled, rather frail boy with an iron fist and quite a 
 few slaps in the face." Arnold's father favored a Hitler-style mustache in 
 photos.   
<p>
 On October 3, ABC News broke the story of Schwarzenegger's 1977 interview in 
 which he was asked whom he admired. Schwarzenegger replied, "I admire Hitler, 
 for instance, because he came from being a little man with almost no formal 
 education, up to power. I admire him for being such a good public speaker and 
 for what he did with it." 
<p>
 To cover himself, Schwarzenegger has made substantial donations to the Los 
 Angeles-based Wiesenthal Center, which tracks down ex-Nazis.  Arnold has also 
 renounced Hitler.   
<p>
 But he has not renounced his friendship with fellow Austrian Kurt Waldheim, 
 the one-time head of the United Nations with known Nazi ties.  The book Arnold: 
 An Unauthorized Biography, documents Arnold toasting Waldheim, who had 
 participated in Nazi atrocities during World War II, at his wedding to Maria 
 Shriver. "My friends don't want me to mention Kurt's name, because of all the recent 
 Nazi stuff and the U.N. controversy," Arnold said.  "But I love him and Maria 
 does to, and so thank you, Kurt."   
<p>
 On May 17, 2001, Schwarzenegger also met with Kenneth "Kenny Boy" Lay of 
 Enron at the Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles.  Through the utility deregulation 
 plan signed into law by Pete Wilson, Schwarzenegger's chief advisor, California 
 was destabilized, bankrupting the state government and opening the door for 
 Tuesday's recall election.  Lay has been George W. Bush's chief financial backer, 
 and a close associate of Karl Rove's.   
<p>
 According to Bob Woodward's Bush at War, Bush attended a New York Yankees 
 game soon after the September 11 World Trade Center disaster.  He wore a 
 fireman's jacket.  As he threw out the first pitch, the crowd roared.  Thousands of 
 fans stuck out their arms with thumbs up.  Karl Rove, sitting in the box of 
 Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, likened the roar of the crowd to "a Nazi rally." 
<p>
 He would know.
