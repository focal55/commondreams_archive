<p>One would have thought Washington had learned from the 1961 Bay of

 Pigs fiasco that you can't really trust exiles who assure you that their people

 will greet you enthusiastically as liberators and rise up against the regime. 

 Despite optimistic predictions, there have thus far been no mass defections of

 Iraqi soldiers, there have been no spontaneous uprisings against Saddam Hussein

 and U.S. and British soldiers attempting to enter Iraqi cities have been met not

 by cheers and flowers but by bullets and grenades.

<p>And this has all taken place in predominantly Shiite-populated

 sections of southern Iraq long considered a center of opposition to Saddam's

 dictatorship.

<p>The reality is that no matter how brutal a dictator may be, people

 tend to defend their homeland against foreign invaders.  Russians defended their

 country through staggering losses against an invading German army despite their

 suffering under Stalin.  The Iraqis fought off the Iranian counter-attack during

 the 1980s even though Saddam Hussein's regime was as repressive then as it is

 now. 

<p>Arabs have been resisting invaders from the West for many centuries,

 going back as far as the Crusades.  They have long shown a preference for local

 tyrants against conquests from abroad.

<p>Indeed, there are disturbing reports of large numbers of Arab men

 from throughout the Middle East and North Africa crossing the Syrian border for

 the purpose of fighting invading U.S. forces.  As with the Soviet invasion of

 Afghanistan, the U.S. invasion of Iraq may become a cause celebre in the Islamic

 world.  Volunteers interviewed by the BBC all expressed disdain for Saddam

 Hussein's regime but still saw the war as an act of Western imperialism that had

 to be resisted.

<p>Given that a U.S. military victory will be much more difficult than

 anticipated, so will the post-war U.S. occupation:  It appears that instead of

 presiding over a grateful Iraqi people, U.S. occupation forces will more likely

 have to contend with a resentful and possibly vengeful population.  Any puppet

 government U.S. military authorities might try to set up could not last long on

 their own, thereby requiring a long and difficult occupation.  

<p>The level of opposition to a U.S. invasion - both during and after

 the war and both within and outside of Iraq - will depend in part on the number

 of civilian casualties from the U.S. assault.  Already, civilian deaths are

 mounting and will likely increase dramatically as U.S. forces attempt to seize

 larger urban areas.  Lured into ambushes in crowded residential neighborhoods,

 trapped American soldiers will likely be forced to call in close air support,

 resulting in a tremendous toll in civilian lives.

<p>In anticipation of such a scenario, the Bush Administration is

 already attempting to inoculate itself from criticism by claiming that Saddam

 Hussein is using "human shields," though virtually all the Iraqi civilians

 killed so far have been ordinary people in or near their homes.  Similarly,

 claims that the Iraqis are fighting unfairly by placing most of their fighting

 units in the cities raises the question as to how the Iraqi army would survive

 if they did otherwise:  Operation Desert Storm showed what would happen if they

 simply left their troops vulnerable out in flat open desert.  There are no

 forests or mountains in most of Iraq in which to hide.  As a result, as has been

 done throughout thousands of years of warfare in the Middle East, the cities are

 defended from within.

<p>The Pentagon claims that such civilian casualties are "unavoidable."

  This, however, is patently false.  Civilian casualties are unavoidable only if

 the war is unavoidable.  This war was not unavoidable.  As a result, such

 efforts to relieve the United States from moral responsibility will likely fall

 on deaf ears. 

<p>Unlike twelve years ago, the Islamic world now has access to satellite

 television, which will be broadcasting scenes of American forces killing large

 numbers of Muslim civilians and laying waste to their cities.  This can only

 result in the growth of anti-American extremism throughout the Middle East and

 beyond.

<p>And this war was supposed to make us safer from terrorism?
