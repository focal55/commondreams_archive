<p>As Time Warner begins the process of renegotiating its franchise 

agreement with the city of Portland, much of the coverage in the Press 

Herald has focused on cable television. And for good reason.

<p>City residents have no cable choice but Time Warner, and since 1996 the 

cost of its service has risen three times faster than inflation.

<p>But a far more serious long-term issue for Portland residents and 

Maine's economy is Time Warner's stranglehold on broadband cable 

Internet service.

<p>The Internet as we know it developed within a framework of "open 

access." That is, people could choose their own Internet service 

provider (ISP), view any Web site and transmit any information they desired.

<p>Open access did not happen by chance but rather by regulation. Many 

years ago, the Federal Communications Commission required that, for a 

reasonable fee, local phone companies allow their wires to be used by 

rival ISPs to provide Internet service.

<p>The result was robust competition. More than 7,000 ISPs sprang up 

nationwide. Competitive, low-cost service ushered in rapid growth. Open 

access ensured that the Internet developed as a diverse, free-flowing 

and democratic medium.

<p>Today, most people still access the Internet through a dial-up modem. 

But dial-up is rapidly being supplanted by broadband. Broadband is many 

times faster and allows users to view high-resolution streaming video, 

download graphics-rich Web sites and utilize new real-time interactive 

applications and services.

<p>Broadband service can be provided through a cable network, or through a 

digital subscriber line (DSL) that runs on the local phone network, or 

by satellite.

<p>Rather than extend open access rules to broadband, the Bush 

administration issued regulations last March that allow cable companies 

to lock out rival ISPs. A few months later, the administration proposed 

lifting the open access rules for DSL lines as well.

<p>This means that just two companies - Time Warner and Verizon, which 

offers DSL - could control Portland's broadband service for the 

foreseeable future.

<p>The administration says its policies are necessary to ensure that big 

cable and telephone companies have an incentive to roll out broadband 

service nationwide. But about 80 percent of all households are already 

linked to one or more types of broadband infrastructure. There's no 

indication that heightened competition will slow deployment.

<p>The administration also argues that people will be able to choose among 

different kinds of broadband (DSL, cable or satellite) and this will 

provide sufficient competition. But satellite service has technological 

limitations that render it less than ideal. That leaves at best a duopoly.

<p>Lack of competition means higher prices. Even worse, the lack of 

nondiscriminatory open access rules will allow broadband providers like 

Time Warner to inhibit or block access to certain Web sites.

<p>This is no far-fetched conspiracy theory. Cisco Systems, a leading 

network equipment manufacturer, issued a memo to providers recently 

explaining that Cisco tools can "restrict the incoming . . . broadcasts 

(from competitors) as well as subscriber's outgoing access to the . . . 

site to discourage its use. At the same time, you could promote and 

offer your own or partner's services with full-speed features to 

encourage adoption of your service."

<p>Time Warner could thus transmit its own content and the content of 

affiliated companies at high speeds while slowing or blocking access to 

rival sites.

<p>The economic implications are severe. Imagine if a private corporation 

controlled the highways and allowed affiliated companies to truck their 

goods in the fast lane while rivals were restricted to a snail's pace. 

We would never stand for it - nor should we allow the Internet, another 

key piece of economic infrastructure, to be similarly hijacked.

<p>The First Amendment implications are even more chilling. While phone 

companies are prohibited from interfering with a citizen's right to call

(or access through a dial-up modem) anybody he or she wishes, these same

protections have not been extended to broadband.



<p>With Time Warner in control, how long will we be able to view sites 

criticizing big media companies or advocating open access or lower cable

rates? Unfortunately, federal laws bar Portland from requiring open 

access as part of Time Warner's franchise renewal.



<p>The City Council, however, chould pass a strong resolution calling on 

the federal government to revise its policies and adopt open access. A 

resolution could bring attention to the issue and perhaps spur our 

congressional delegation to action.
