<p>I sat next to seventh grader Amina and ninth grader Samara on the Royal 
Jordanian flight from Baghdad to Amman a week ago.  These two young girls 
are fleeing Iraq with their family, as are millions of other Iraqis, for
neighboring Jordan.  Syria is inundated with Iraqi refugees; the girls' 
father estimated around four million.

<p>"Iraqis right now are like this," describes Samara.  "It's like putting 
mice in a jar and shaking it up and then letting the mice run loose. That 
is Iraq.  That is how the people are."

<p>Disoriented.  Chaotic.  Dazed.  Quaking.

<p>But on the surface you'd never know.  In Baghdad for an international 
student gathering, I had the opportunity to walk around the city to 
restaurants, strolling and taking stock of the fragile situation.  Old men 
sat outside cafes playing chess, drinking Iraqi chai, or sweet tea. Young 
men worked to clean out and repair building facades.  Boys washed cars and 
peddled cigarettes.  Women and children walked to and from the markets, and 
kids went to school.  Life on the surface appears normal.

<p>But the two girls, Amina and Samara, are correct.  Their metaphor 
accurately depicts Iraq at this moment.  People are recalling the first 
Gulf War, thinking of all that was destroyed and the enduring catastrophic 
sanctions which have left their country largely unrepaired.  The people of 
Iraq are considerably less prepared and certainly less healthy than they
were twelve years ago.

<p>Iraq's medical infrastructure provided for preventative medicine for all
members of society.  Children in 1990 had all their inoculations and an 
infrastructure which provided them with clean water and adequate 
nutrition.  Today, due to the sporadic functioning of electrical plants,
refrigerated vaccinations ruin, and crucial medical supplies like x-ray 
film and bloodbags are hard to come by.  A centrifuge waited on hold in 
Amman, banned by the Sanctions Committee 661.

<p>UNICEF and the World Food Programme have been trying to prepare the country 
for a U.S.-led invasion.  These agencies, along with every other United 
Nations agency dealing with children, agriculture, health, welfare, 
education and nutrition, have reported on the devastating effects of the
sanctions, and now they are bracing for a humanitarian crisis resulting 
from a massive attack.  UNICEF worries most about the people having access 
to clean water post-invasion.  In 1991, civilian infrastructure like water 
and sewage treatment facilities were targeted, as were roads and 
bridges.  UNICEF is working around the clock to distribute humanitarian 
goods all over the country so that in the case of damaged transportation
routes, the people will have access to vital sustenance.

<p>They are getting unprecedented cooperation from the Government of Iraq in 
importing and distributing  necessary goods, like high protein biscuits and 
F100, a therapeutic food/medicine which helps to recover body weight and
fluid in cases of severe dehydration and malnutrition.  These two 
particular items had been unimportable for over two years.

<p>While major media networks are reporting that as a tactic of war, Saddam
intends to starve his people, the humanitarian agencies dealing with food 
distribution are reporting the exact opposite.  Already, UNICEF is 
distributing the food rations for June and July, and they were given the
authority six months ago to begin distributing rations in two months' 
supply at the urgence of the Government of Iraq.  In essence, the 
government and the United Nations agencies are working in concert to ensure 
that in the case of war, the people would not be unprepared.

<p>Many U.N. agencies are also working with the local Iraqi staff to complete 
post-conflict assessments.  UNICEF has been training teachers how to 
diagnose students with severe trauma and where to refer them for further
in-depth care.  Schools are also a crucial part of the post-conflict plan 
for supporting the children of Iraq whose age demographics comprise half of 
the country, and UNICEF believes it will be very important to have a 
functioning educational infrastructure so that students can resume some 
normalcy as quickly as possible after a major attack.

<p>But what will that normalcy look like?

<p>How can life be normal for a four-year-old who has experience the "shock
and awe" of 800 bombs falling on his city in just two days?  Even if school 
restarts, even if there is a commitment from the United States to rebuild 
Iraq, how could we ever undo the damage done to the children of Iraq who
have no control over their leader, his policies or the past grievances of 
the Iraqi government.

<p>The internationally supported alternative  weapons inspections  should be 
given ample time to work.  The aforementioned student gathering is another 
means for creating spaces for peace: dialogue.  Young people separated by 
warring governments need the space to know each other as people, not as 
enemy nations.

<p>War is not liberation.  Bombs do not bring peace.
