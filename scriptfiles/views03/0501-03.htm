<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTE: The battle for Baghdad is won, but have we won the war? Have we even gained ground? To answer this question, we have to step back and look at the big picture, both at home and abroad. In this second of a two-part series, I examine the impact and implications of the war at home.

</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's start where we left off <A href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0424-10.htm" target=_new>last week</A>: The majority of Americans, despite generalized support for the war in Iraq and President Bush, have <A href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=370" target=_new>deep concerns</A> about what this war will <A href="http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?itemid=14877&amp;CFID=6821987&amp;CFTOKEN=68498698" target=_new>cost</A>, both literally and figuratively. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The George Bush who avoided active service in Vietnam through college deferment and then <A href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/02/04/03_draft.html" target=_new>Air National Guard</A> service and then <A href="http://www.tompaine.com/feature.cfm/ID/3671" target=_new>blew off</A> even this "safe" duty after <A href="http://www.talion.com/suspension.html" target=_new>refusing</A> to take a drug test, had <A href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/18/press.column/" target=_new>zero foreign policy experience</A>, and voiced <A href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A27756-2003Mar14&amp;notFound=true" target=_new>strong opposition</A> to becoming the "<A href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/videos_corr.jhtml?p=stewart" target=_new>world's policeman</A>" is long gone, replaced by a strident, <A href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/nukes/unilateralism.html" target=_new>unilateralist</A> hawk who acts every bit the <A href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/30/bush.carrier.landing/" target=_new>Commander-in-Chief</A>. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nation-building" went from <A href="http://www.issues2000.org/George_W__Bush_Foreign_Policy.htm" target=_new>epithet</A> to <A href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A6853-2003Feb26?language=printer" target=_new>essential task</A>. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, even as President Bush <A href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/story.jsp?story=402021" target=_new>theatrically announces</A> the end of the conflict, the White House acknowledges that <A href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/consequences/2003/0217cost.htm" target=_new>$600 billion</A> will be needed for this episode of nation-building in addition to the $100 billion already committed in direct war costs. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The amount, coincidentally, is the amount that could <A href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june03/medicare_3-4.html" target=_new>save Medicare</A>. It certainly makes the <A href="http://www.undp.org.in/media/ht/170102.htm" target=_new>$15 billion</A> dollar estimate for that forgotten nation we were just rebuilding, Afghanistan, seem paltry. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what has been happening at home while President Bush rediscovered his <A href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1059-647986,00.html" target=_new>spirit of adventure</A> (technically, it would be vicarious adventure, since the real soldiers in Iraq are actually the ones taking the risk)? Let's have a look at some of the measures of national health, and at the health of our basic freedoms. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Economic Stability</B> 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Did it give you pause last week when there was a three-day run on New York-based <A href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/nyc-bankrun0425,0,6585937.story?coll=ny-nynews-headlines" target=_new>Abacus Bank</A>? How about the fact that the Bush administration has already had to <A href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/business/5709286.htm" target=_new>finagle</A> the <A href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/" target=_new>National Debt</A> ceiling twice in the last two months? That debt now stands at a staggering <A href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpdodt.htm" target=_new>$6,460,581,338,149.98</A> and has been increasing at an average of <A href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/" target=_new>$1.13 billion per day</A> since September 30, 2002. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Clinton left office, with a <A href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/27/clinton.surplus/" target=_new>balanced budget and a surplus</A>, unemployment stood at its lowest rate since the 1960s. In less than three years, the rate has increased 24 percent to <A href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target=_new>5.8 percent</A>. That's the national average. The rate for blacks is 10.2. The rate for Hispanics is 7.5. These statistics don't count the 1.6 million people who are so discouraged they have stopped looking for jobs. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the president's home state of Texas, the unemployment rate rose to <A href="http://www.forbes.com/business/energy/newswire/2003/04/25/rtr952214.html" target=_new>6.7 percent</A>. Unemployment stands near <A href="http://www.tribune-democrat.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=7715685&amp;BRD=2332&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=484742&amp;rfi=6" target=_new>10 percent</A> in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, where America was buoyed last year by the miraculous <A href="http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20020729mineindex9.asp" target=_new>rescue</A> of nine trapped coal miners. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly, these folks are in worse shape than the millions of working Americans who have lost most or all of their retirement savings in the economic downturn and <A href="http://www.thedailyenron.com/documents/20020715132546-72562.asp" target=_new>corporate scandals</A>. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And just what has happened to the corporate reform promised by President Bush in the wake of <A href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/enron/index.asp" target=_new>Enron</A>? To date, <A href="http://www.forbes.com/business/newswire/2003/04/30/rtr957277.html" target=_new>zero corrupt executives</A> have been jailed. Only <A href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/business/1891337" target=_new>seven executives</A> at Enron were even charged with a crime. Bush recently <A href="http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=1356" target=_new>appointed</A> a lobbyist with <A href="http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=1356" target=_new>ties to Enron</A> to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), right about the time his administration was <A href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/rebuilding_iraq/index.asp" target=_new>lining up fat contracts</A>&nbsp;- without competitive bids - for his cronies to do the "rebuilding" in Iraq. </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over at Qwest Communications, <A href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/ceo/articles/0,15114,447131,00.html" target=_new>Fortune magazine</A> says, "Joe Nacchio ran a company once worth $86 billion, and left it on the brink of insolvency, walking away with $260 million." But Nacchio is not alone: Fortune has compiled what it calls a "<A href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/ceo" target=_new>pig list</A>" of CEO "Neros" who fiddled and got rich while Rome burned. While the economy crumbled, and workers gave back pay and benefits, median CEO compensation rose <A href="http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/news/137-04242003-78394.html" target=_new>14 percent</A>. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, 29 states including Enron target <A href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/30/BA206822.DTL" target=_new>California</A>, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have imposed draconian budget cuts. Two-thirds of states have laws mandating balanced budgets, but <A href="http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/ArticleNews/gttech/TGAM/20030430/COSIMP30" target=_new>face deficits</A>. In Missouri, they want to unscrew one of every three light bulbs to save state funds. In Texas, the chief justice proposes a <A href="http://www.trib.com/AP/wire_detail.php?wire_num=107233" target=_new>constitutional amendment</A> to eliminate two state Supreme Court justices to save money. Some Pennsylvanian legislators actually think citizens will <A href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/08/politics/main548369.shtml" target=_new>volunteer to pay more taxes</A>. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <A href="http://www.stockmarkettiming.com/historical-charts.html" target=_new>Dow Jones Industrial average</A> has lost more than 21 percent of its value in the past three years. The <A href="http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=nasdaq&amp;sid=3291&amp;o_symb=nasdaq&amp;freq=2&amp;time=20" target=_new>NASDAQ</A> lost an astonishing 41 percent of its value. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), that arbiter of national economic health, increased only <A href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/gdp103a.htm" target=_new>1.6 percent</A> in the first quarter of 2003. It increased <A href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/gdp103a.htm" target=_new>3.8 percent</A> in 2000, but only <A href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/gdp103a.htm" target=_new>.3 percent</A> in 2001. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Liberty and Freedom for All</B> 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Bush inherited these economic woes, right? And he had to spend money to defend us after September 11. We needed to fight to preserve our fundamental American way of life: Democracy, liberty, justice, freedom. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So how is the Bush administration doing with that task? If you think Iraq really posed a <A href="http://www.bushcountry.org/news/columnists/jonathan-clark/c_091702_jonathan-clark_clear-present-danger.htm" target=_new>clear and present danger</A>, then you probably think we are doing pretty well. 
</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since September 11, 2001, we have faced some very difficult choices about our individual liberties and our justice system. I believe that the choices made by the Bush administration present a much graver threat to the American way of life than Iraq, Iran and North Korea put together. By acting out of fear and suspicion, by not trusting the strength of the American system of government and the strength of the American people, Bush has betrayed us.

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the government's intolerant lead, hate groups and hate crimes are <A href="http://www.tolerance.org/maps/hate/index.html" target=_new>on the rise</A> across the country.
