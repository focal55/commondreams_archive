<p>Last September in Canc&uacute;n, the Bush administration's promises of free trade's benefits ran headlong into the reality of the last ten years under the World Trade Organization and the U.S.-Canada-Mexico arrangement known as NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Governments from Latin America, Africa and Asia decried the loss of millions of farm jobs, and denounced a system that promotes the continued export of agricultural commodities below their cost of production price (dumping) by U.S. and European agribusiness corporations. That's why the WTO talks in Canc&uacute;n collapsed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a close look at the underlying conflicts at the WTO reveals the potential for a new approach that negotiators trying to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas should use as a blueprint. It would create a win-win solution to the chronic low prices that plague farmers in the United States, Brazil and elsewhere.</p>
<p>International trade negotiations used to be about finding solutions that were aimed at benefiting societies as a whole. In 1947, just a few miles from Miami, governments met in Havana to discuss the creation of the International Trade Organization (ITO). The stated goal for the organization was full employment and the end to global monopolies and predatory trade practices. At that time, the nations gathered knew well the ravages of war and the role that brutal trade conflicts played in creating the economic Depression of the 1930s, the breeding ground for fascism.</p>
<p><b>Balancing needs</b></p>
<p>At the talks in Havana, the U.S. Department of Agriculture brought forward a special set of agricultural trade rules that would help balance the needs of producers and consumers with an emphasis on protecting food security over the long term. In essence, U.S. negotiators, with the Great Depression still very much on their minds, developed rules that helped nations balance supply and demand.</p>
<p>The ITO never got off the ground, but these agricultural rules were included in the original General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, precursor to the WTO. The rules allowed nations to use quantitative import controls as long as they were imposing supply controls. This spurred countries to address domestic oversupply, helping to bring global supply and demand into balance. This plan was key to the ''golden era'' for U.S. and global agriculture in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>The WTO Agreement on Agriculture undid this important work, but now the ministers gathering in Miami have an opportunity to make improvements by returning to the work done by the pioneers back in Havana in 1947. They have to tackle global oversupply in ways that can help producers in Florida and Brazil earn a profit by restoring the balance between supply and demand that has been damaged by the ''race to the bottom'' results of free trade.</p>
<p>Negotiators must address monopoly-style business practices that dominate global trade in highly competitive products when global prices fall too far.</p>
<p><b>Tariffs beneficial</b></p>
<p>The solution to low commodity prices in general, be it orange juice or coffee, is not that complicated. Every business knows that when supply and demand are out of balance, there is going to be trouble. In agriculture, when there is not enough supply, some people go hungry. When there is too much supply, prices drop, farmers suffer and many go out of business.</p>
<p>We need modern trade agreements that enable countries to restore the balancing mechanisms for supply and demand. To take that step, the Bush administration needs to unlock the ''free trade'' straitjacket of eliminating tariffs at all costs, and start focusing on agricultural market fundamentals.</p>
