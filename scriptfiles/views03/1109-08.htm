<p>It wasn't censorship. <p>It was cowardice. <p>CBS has turned yellow-fraidy- 
chicken and booted its two-part television docudrama The Reagans to the cable 
network Showtime. A lot fewer people will see it there. That's what the sweaty 
execs at CBS want. <p>They dumped The Reagans because advertisers had run screaming 
from the show. Why did they bail? Pressure from conservative groups. Rightward 
apologists say it was a "grassroots outcry" from The People. <p>That's a laugh 
riot. It was power politics all the way, an organized whine-fest capped when Ed 
Gillespie, the Republican National Committee chairman, called on CBS President 
Leslie Moonves to have historians review the movie for factuality. Bad publicity 
scares ads away, which scares execs silly. And so CBS caved. <p>Which was cowardice. 
<p>Not censorship. <p>When government forbids or prevents the use of free speech, 
that's censorship. When special-interest groups lean on free-market businesses 
to change what they're doing, that's the American way. Like it or not, everything 
here was free-market legal. <p>But what's legal can still be regrettable. The 
best remedy for free speech to which you object is not squelching that speech, 
but countering it with speech that upholds your point of view. The Reagans' defenders 
could have issued a rebuttal to errors they spied in the miniseries - and aired 
their rejoinder during the broadcast. <p>But the real culprit is not conservatives 
for howling. It's CBS for running scared. The logical conclusion from CBS' action 
is that all any group - left, right or middle - needs to do to deep-six a show 
is generate a flood of angry e-mail. That way lies pabulum. <p>Some object that 
The Reagans is not factual. Well, that's like objecting that ballerinas wear see-through 
tights. The programbelongs to an addled genre known as "docudrama": a fiction 
based on somebody's already selective first draft of history. You take a half-understood 
story, trample the facts with total abandon, and produce something that looks 
like a documentary but is really a drama. <p>Want to see docudrama in action? 
Watch television at 9 p.m. tonight. Two docudramas will go empty head to empty 
head, Saving Jessica Lynch on NBC and The Elizabeth Smart Story on, whaddayaknow, 
CBS. <p>Neither show has much to do with a factual recounting. NBC couldn't get 
Lynch to authorize this production. So it's based on a book by Iraqi lawyer Mohammed 
al-Rehaief, a one-man self-hyping machine who claims he made her war rescue possible. 
Plenty of people think his story has more holes than a Baghdad museum. <p>The 
Elizabeth Smart Story evidently manages to tell about a Mormon teenager's abduction 
by a Mormon extremist without mentioning Mormonism much. Oops. <p>The Reagans 
also substitutes sentimentality and dramatic convenience for fact. But that's 
not un-American. It's all too American. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 1996-2003
