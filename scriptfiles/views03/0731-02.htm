<p>The mood at the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday was decidedly 

self-congratulatory. It was one year after the President had signed the 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (S-OX), and lawmakers and regulators had gathered for a 

press conference in the SEC's basement. They were there to celebrate a year 

of progress in cleaning up the conditions that led to a tickertape of 

scandals that started with Enron and went on and on : Adelphia . Tyco . 

Global Crossing . Dynegy . Qwest . WorldCom . HealthSouth . Halliburton 

(that one went down the memory hole, didn't it?) . Freddie Mac.



<p>But if anybody should have been celebrating, it was the corporate lobbyists 

who, despite a tsunami of corporate crime that looted trillions of dollars 

from millions of workers and small investors, have watered down the rules 

implementing the law, continued their legislative assault on investor 

rights, and prevented virtually any other significant reform from being 

given serious consideration. The real story is not how much has been done to 

fix the conditions that led to the scandals - it is how little has been 

done.



<p>Instead of figuring out what's next, members of Congress, with tacit support 

from the SEC, are trying to tack a dangerous little provision onto an 

otherwise decent bill that would boost the SEC's powers to seize the 

ill-gotten gains from corporate criminals. That "poison pill" provision in 

HR 2179 ("The Securities Fraud Deterrence and Investor Restitution Act of 

2003") says that state securities regulators have to bow to the SEC when



dealing with securities violations in their states. If this had been law a 

year ago, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's hands would have been 

tied and there would have been no big Wall Street enforcement action, anemic 

as it was. This obvious assault on investor rights is the clearest sign yet 

that the financial services industry and their allies in Congress are intent 

on rolling back the incipient investor protection movement that seems to be 

gaining momentum. Supporters of this provision postponed a House committee 

vote on the bill before August recess, but promised to reintroduce the 

legislation with some improvements in the fall.



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is also letting reform efforts 

backslide in the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley. In implementing 

conflict-of-interest rules for accountants, for example, the agency decided 

to let auditors still provide tax advice, including advice on tax shelters. 

One of the goals of Sarbanes-Oxley was to make sure such conflicts were 

eliminated, so that auditors wouldn't go soft on the books because they 

wanted to earn other lucrative non-audit business from the same clients. So 

much for that idea. And we still have a situation where the same firm 

advising a company on how to cheat the Treasury through complex tax shelters 

can still be responsible for certifying that a company's books are honest.



<p>Then there was the issue of corporate lawyers, who, under the legislation, 

were supposed to act as whistleblowers when they observed blatant and 

unremedied fraud. When the SEC got around to implementing the rules for 

lawyers, it stopped at requiring them to report up-the-ladder within the



company, rather than going the next step and reporting fraud to the SEC.



<p>Like so many well-intended provisions of law, this "noisy withdrawl" rule 

has so far been quietly snuffed out by corporate lawyers and lobbyists.



<p>Then there is the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the supposed 

crown jewel of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. So far, the group is best known for 

its ability to vote its members half-a-million-dollar a year salaries and 

for having an initial chairman who was on the audit committee of a company 

being sued for financial fraud.



<p>So while lawmakers and regulators break out the cake and balloons on the



first anniversary of the Sarbanes-0xley Act, Citizen Works says not so fast. 

<p>We offer this list of ten reforms that we believe are essential to truly



cracking down on widespread corporate crime:



<p>1.	Give the owners more control over the corporation. Many of the

corporate 

scandals involved corporate governance failures. Corporations should open up 

proxy ballots to minority shareholders and should introduce cumulative 

voting so that shareholders can democratically nominate and elect the 

corporate board of directors. Shareholders should also vote on major 

corporate decisions, like executive pay and mergers and acquisitions of $1 

billion or more.



<p>2.	Rein in excessive executive pay. Despite repeated scandals and

outrages, 

CEO pay remains obscenely high and largely unlinked to performance. As a



start, the SEC should require shareholders to approve annually all executive 

compensation plans.



<p>3.	Expense stock options. Keeping stock options off the balance

sheet allows 

corporation to continue to inflate profits and mislead investors. In order 

to have honest accounting, options must be counted as expenses. Members of 

Congress (e.g. Mike Enzi, the only accountant among the bunch) should drop 

any effort to delay FASB's effort to finish this inevitable reform.



<p>4.	Regulate derivatives trading. Unregulated derivatives trading

has been a 

key factor in most major financial scandals of the past decade. They also 

figured prominently in the recent Freddie Mac fiasco. Rules for derivatives 

trading should be enacted regarding collateral-margin, reporting, and dealer 

licensing in order to maintain regulatory parity and ensure that markets are 

transparent and problems can be detected before they become a crisis.



<p>5.	Crack down on corporate tax havens. Every year, U.S.

corporations cheat 

the Treasury Department out of billions of dollars through off-shore tax



havens. Some companies have even moved their headquarters there while 

keeping their operations in the United States. The government needs to start 

going after these tax cheats and stop giving them government contracts.



<p>6.	Eliminate the gap between what companies tell the IRS and what

they tell 

shareholders. Corporations report very different incomes to the IRS and to 

shareholders. In 1998, the gap was $159 billion, up from $92.5 billion two 

years earlier. From 1996 to 1999, Enron paid no federal income tax, 

reporting tax losses of three billion dollars while reporting to its 

shareholders rosy profits of over two billion dollars. Either corporations 

are cheating the government or lying to shareholders - and either way it



needs to stop.



<p>7.	Establish an annual corporate crime report and database. It is

hard to 

fix the problem of corporate crime without good, well-organized data. To



remedy this, the Department of Justice should establish an online corporate 

crime database and the FBI should produce an annual corporate crime report 

as an analogue to its annual Crime in America report, which focuses 

principally on street crime.



<p>8.	Enact tough contractor responsibility standards. MCI/WorldCom

enjoys 

approximately $1 billion a year in government contracts despite having 

admitted to the largest accounting fraud case in history. The federal 

government should not be rewarding corporate criminals and corporate tax



traitors who move to Bermuda with taxpayer money. Instead, it should enact 

high standards for contractors.



<p>9.	Restore protections for investors. The Private Securities

Litigation 

Reform Act of 1995 created the conditions for the financial scandals by 

making it harder for defrauded investors to sue the aiders and abettors of 

corporate fraud - the bankers, lawyers, and accountants. Until this law is 

repealed, defrauded investors will have little success in seeking 

restitution through the courts.



<p>10.	 Enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Yesterday, the

Senate 

Finance Committee released a report indicating that the SEC and the 

Department of Justice failed to act on an IRS referral of "serious 

allegations" regarding potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices 

Act by Enron. The disturbing question is: how many of these cases are not 

being aggressively pursued. Other potential violators include Tyco, Xerox, 

Halliburton and Accenture.
