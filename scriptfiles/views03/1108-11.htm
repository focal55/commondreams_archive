<p>It gets weirder and weirder. As his helicopters are falling out of the sky 
over Iraq, President Bush tells us things are getting even better. The more we 
succeed, he says, the deadlier the attacks will become. Thank God the Americans 
now have a few - a very few - brave journalists, like Maureen Dowd, to explain 
what is happening. <p>The worse things are, the better they get. Iraq's wartime 
information minister, "Comical Ali", had nothing on this; he claimed the Americans 
weren't in Baghdad when we could see their tanks. Bush claims he's going to introduce 
democracy in the Middle East when his soldiers are facing more than resistance 
in Iraq. They are facing an insurrection. <p>So let's take a look at the latest 
lies. "Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom 
in the Middle East did nothing to make us safe," he told us on Thursday. "Because 
in the long run, stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty." Well 
said, Sir. George Bush Jr sounds almost as convincing as, well, Tony Blair. It's 
all a lie. "We" - the West, Europe, America - never "excused and accommodated" 
lack of freedom. We endorsed lack of freedom. We created it in the Middle East 
and supported it. <p>When Colonel Ghaddafi took over Libya, the Foreign Office 
thought him a much sprightlier figure than King Idriss. We supported the Egyptian 
generals (aka Gamal Abdul Nasser) when they originally kicked out King Farouk. 
We - the Brits - created the Hashemite Kingdom in Jordan. We - the Brits - put 
a Hashemite King on the throne of Iraq. And when the Baath party took over from 
the monarchy in Baghdad, the CIA obligingly handed Saddam's mates the names of 
all senior communist party members so they could be liquidated. <p>The Brits created 
all those worthy sheikhdoms in the Gulf. Kuwait was our doing; Saudi Arabia was 
ultimately a joint Anglo-US project, the United Arab Emirates (formerly the Trucial 
State) etc. But when Iran decided in the 1950s that it preferred Mohammed Mossadeq's 
democratic rule to the Shah's, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt, with Colonel "Monty" Woodhouse 
of MI6, overthrew democracy in Iran. Now President Bush demands the same "democracy" 
in present-day Iran and says we merely "excused and accommodated" the loathsome 
US-supported Shah's regime. <p>Now let's have another linguistic analysis of Mr 
Bush's words. "The failure of Iraqi democracy," he told us two days ago, "would 
embolden terrorists around the world, increase dangers to the American people, 
and extinguish the hopes of millions in the region." Here's another take: the 
failure of the Bush administration to control Israel's settlement-building on 
Arab land would embolden terrorists around the world, increase dangers to the 
American people and extinguish the hopes of millions in the region. Now that would 
be more like it. But no. President Bush thinks Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
is "a man of peace". <p>And then there's that intriguing Bush demand for a revolution 
in undemocratic Iran. Sure, Iran is a theocratic state (a necrocracy, I suspect), 
but the morally impressive President Mohamed Khatami, repeatedly thwarted by the 
dictatorial old divines, was democratically elected - and by a far more convincing 
majority than President George Bush Jr in the last US presidential elections. 
<p>Yes, "democracy can be the future of every nation", Bush tells us. So why did 
his country support Saddam's viciousness and war crimes for so many years? Why 
did Washington give its blessing, at various stages, to Colonel Ghaddafi, Hafez 
Assad of Syria, the Turkish generals, Hassan of Morocco, the Shah, the sleek Ben 
Ali of Tunisia, the creepy generals of Algeria, the plucky little King of Jordan 
and even - breathe in because the UNOCAL boys wanted a gas pipeline through Afghanistan 
- the Taliban? <p>A break here. Fouad Siniora is the finance minister of Lebanon. 
He is a believer in the American way of life, a graduate of the American University 
of Beirut and a former lecturer there, an ex-executive of Citibank. He has a valid 
American visa in his passport. Yet he has been telephoned by the American embassy 
in Beirut to be told he will not be permitted entry to the US. <p>Why? Because 
last year he gave $660 at a Ramadan fast-breaking iftah to a charity that runs 
educational projects and orphanages in Lebanon. The organization is run by Sayed 
Mohamed Fadlallah - once described by the Western press as the "spiritual adviser" 
to Hizbollah. CIA sources long ago revealed that they tried to kill Fadlallah 
- they failed, but their Saudi-prepared car bomb killed 75 civilians - so Siniora, 
an Americanophile to his fingertips, is persona non grata in the US. Fadlallah 
is not Hizbollah's "spiritual adviser" - so he could hardly withdraw his support 
for its victory over the Israeli army in Lebanon three years ago - but the loony-tune 
"security" legislation in the US has deprived Siniora of any further contact with 
a country he admires. <p>Yes, roll on democracy. Bring 'em on. The new "Rummyworld" 
war on terror is in Iraq. Ban the press from filming the return of dead American 
soldiers to the US. Liberty is what it's about, democracy. "Accommodating the 
lack of freedom in the Middle East", indeed. We created this place, drew its borders, 
weaned their grotesque dictators. And we expect the Arabs to trust Mr Bush's promise?
