<p>I am horrified as I read in the newspapers about the Iraqi families who have been bombed in their homes by the United States and who are reeling from the shock. I am immediately thrust back to the moment in 1998 in Nairobi, Kenya, when I was in the basement of the U.S. Embassy with my two small children and we were bombed by al Qaeda cohorts of Osama bin Laden.</p>

    <p> I remember the moment of impact when I was thrown to the floor in darkness, stunned by a phenomenon I had never before witnessed, just as Iraqi mothers and fathers are stunned today. I remember searching desperately for my children on the floor in that dark basement, screaming to find out if they were alive. I remember finding them and holding them, while all around me people who were wounded were calling out. I remember stumbling to find my way out of the embassy, crawling through the rubble and confusion and fire. I remember the fear and the feeling that this is what hell must be like. I remember burying my friends and mourning our loss, as Iraqi families are doing today. I remember that I, like those in Iraq now, just didn't understand.</p>

    <p>How could such an act of inhumanity happen, I wondered in my sorrow and confusion. The Iraqi people, caught in their own homes while minding their own business, must be asking the same question.</p>

    <p> My conclusion after being attacked in Nairobi was that we Americans had every obligation to bridge the gap of misunderstanding and to try to communicate and learn about the anger directed at us. Being the wife of a diplomat, I felt that diplomacy was needed more than ever, to open up dialogue and find resolution to our conflicts with people in Muslim nations. I felt that not only formal diplomacy but also informal diplomacy, the kind that I and other Americans living abroad pursued every day, was of utmost importance if we were ever to begin to find a way toward solutions to our misunderstandings. We had to meet and know each other and begin to talk.</p>

    <p> After the attacks on our nation on Sept. 11, 2001, we could either have learned a lesson -- that we desperately need to work with other nations to find a way to understand each other -- or we could have taken revenge, using the same tactics that were used against us.</p>

    <p>Our president, who himself has never lived in another country, decided that the way to stop all this terror and anger directed at our country is to bomb Iraq. Rather than expanding our diplomatic efforts, we stopped them, in favor of bombing. We resorted to bombs and military attacks in an all-out effort to stop the hatred against our people.</p>

    <p> But I am certain that bombs only exacerbate anger and pain and confusion and terror, and it grieves me to see that we are doing to other innocent people exactly what was done to us in 1998. You are wrong, Mr. President, if you think this will heal the anger against us. You are wrong, Mr. Rumsfeld, if you think you can bomb away terror. You are wrong, Mr. Cheney, if you think this will all be over soon.</p>

    <p>As a member of one family that survived a bomb, I can tell you from the bottom of my heart: Bombing will never be the solution. Do you think the Iraqi families you are bombing today are going to get up and thank you and want to know more about our great country? You are wrong.</p>
