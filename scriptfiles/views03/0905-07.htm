<p>On Aug. 21, U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee convened a public forum in his district on the need for a non-partisan national commission to examine the role of intelligence in the national security decision-making process leading to the Iraq War. It was clear that Inslee's purpose was not a partisan intelligence blame game expedition.

<p>The forum was a search for an understanding of the policy process that led to a premature decision to invade a sovereign country without the support of the international community and in violation of the charter of the United Nations. Inslee was chairman of the panel, which also included former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, retired Adm. William Center and this author.

<p>More than 1,200 citizens turned out at Shoreline Community College on a weekday at noon to give their views on this critical question -- a remarkable turnout. What consensus did this forum appear to reach, and what remains to be learned?

<p>Here is what I heard. There was not sufficient evidence to justify an invasion of a foreign country in violation of international law and in absence of an appropriate action of the international community. 

<p>There was not sufficient evidence of an imminent threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to justify an invasion. The international inspection regime was not given enough time and assistance to do the job assigned to it by the United Nations.

<p>It also appears, although further study may be required, that at least some information on the actual threat was hyped, spun or otherwise skewed to justify a decision already made. The United States did not seek the cooperation mid support of the international community or regard its input with respect. On the famous 16 words in the State of the Union address, the United States acted in bad faith to its oldest and most loyal ally.

<p>To understand what remains to be learned, remember that what we are dealing with here is presidential, i.e. National Security Council, decision-making on vital national security matters. The question is: Given what they actually knew, did they make the right decision? Was the policy based on a sound understanding of what should be our place in the world? Does our arrogant (as seen by the rest of the world) decision to go it alone really augur well for the many years to come?

<p>After telling the United Nations and most major nations to stay out, how do we reverse that terrible failure, especially since we appear to be at last seeking their help because of our budget problem? Should we abandon the experience of the Cold War, the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO and the lessons of Vietnam and just forge ahead virtually unilaterally? These are policy questions that must be answered by the decision makers and with the full understanding of the public.

<p>Inslee is to be commended for calling for a bipartisan group of experts to deal with this, the most pressing crisis in American foreign policy, in years. His study must address how we get out of the cul-de-sac into which our policy has placed us. We must sharply improve the perception that our longtime allies have of this new imperial America and work hard at the collaborative reconstruction efforts and try to gain the respect of the Muslim world.

<p>We must reverse the course of this country toward international machinery for peace, human welfare, human rights and the environment. We must join and support the several international commitments that we have rejected: Law of the Sea, Kyoto, International Criminal Court, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ABM Treaty and the Pacific Salmon Commission. We must use diplomacy and the support of the international community, not the threat of unilateral pre-emptive war to deal with dangerous and threatening regimes.

<p>With the full involvement of the United Nations, we must restore Iraq and Afghanistan to peace, self-government and safety and an opportunity for a better life for their citizens. In an earlier outstanding piece in the Our Place in the World series ("Experience says Iraq will resist U.S. imposed democracy," July 18), James Huntley, who helped build democracy in postwar Germany from 1952 to 1955, sets forth how difficult it will be to do this job.


<p>We must do it and, so far, we are not prepared to do it. And we cannot do it as a colonial occupying power, which is how we are viewed in the world and the region. Above all, we must recraft our place in the world. And we must do it with national security policy leadership of the quality of President Truman, President Eisenhower, Dean Acheson, George C. Marshall, Robert Lovett and George Kennan.
