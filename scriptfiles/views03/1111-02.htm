<p>The baby had gone into a deep sleep in the warm funeral home and she was flat on her back in the mother's arms as the mother brought her out into the chill night. The baby did not move. Warm air, cold air, it made no difference.
<p>The mother was carrying her out from the wake of  Sgt. Joel Perez, dead at 25 when he went down in a Chinook helicopter near Fallujah, Iraq, Nov. 2. The wake was in a funeral home with a neon sign saying, "Funerarias Las Americas."
<p>"I'm the cousin," the woman said.
<p>"His mother called my mother and then my mother told me," she said. "That is how you find out."
<p>She shook her head and said she didn't want to talk anymore and she left.
<p>On the funeral parlor steps were Omar Valentine, 22, and a friend.
<p>"Did you know the guy well?" Omar was asked.
<p>"The wife."
<p>"From school," the friend said.
<p>"We graduated high school together. Essex County Vocational."
<p>"He was coming home to surprise them," the friend said.
<p>That is all they had to say. Nobody else wanted to talk, either. What was there to say?

</table>The other Sunday, in high excitement, Sgt. Perez got on a helicopter that was going to start him home to his wife, Milagros, and 15-month-old daughter in time for the wedding anniversary, which was yesterday, the day they put him into the ground in Newark.
<p>He had not told his wife that he was coming home and the others in the family kept it secret. He got on that helicopter because he had a Bronze Star and Purple Heart from the fighting.
<p>Now, yesterday, he was a name on a list of the dead. If I had not been typing out this list, I wouldn't have known that Perez was the short ride away at Newark.
<p>There is no public display over the death and all these others on the list accompanying this column. Bush and his people sent them out to get killed and now you can't get one of them in Washington to mention these dead.
<p>Your government would prefer that night falls and the dead are buried in darkness. We must keep them remote, names on a list, and concentrate on things like patriotism, exporting democracy and shipping freedom - all those big words that Joyce said make us so unhappy.
<p>On this list of our dead is a name that shakes the insides. It is Staff Sgt. Morgan D. Kennon, age 23. He is from Memphis, Tenn. "Kennon was guarding a bank in Mosul, Iraq, when his position came under rocket-propelled grenade attack."
<p>He was from the 101st Airborne in Fort Campbell, Ky. He never had a job. He went from Central High in Memphis to the Airborne. He picked a spot as rough as he could find. Then they sent him to war, proud and strong, and put him in front of a bank like a retired broken-down cop.
<p>This is called nation building in Iraq. Repairing the infrastructure. Putting freedom into the country. Fighting terrorism.
<p>Stand in front of a bank and get shot like he's guarding an ATM in Brooklyn.
<p>Kennon's mother talks to nobody. She is separated from her husband, who is an over-the-road truck driver. His brother, Isaac, was killed when a burglar broke into his home in 1975. Kennon's oldest son, Marcus Kennon, was murdered and his body thrown onto the street in Birmingham in 2000. His girlfriend Sharron White disappeared in 1986 and hasn't been found.
<p>And the other Friday he arrived home from work at 4 p.m. and he was taking off his shoes when there was a knock on the door. Two Army officers were at his front door. Right away, they told him that his son had died but he had not suffered.
<p>They did not tell him that the best thing in his life was put out in front of a bank with all that bravery. And he was shot as if in a common robbery.
<p>He was guarding God. The money that is the true religion of Bush and Cheney and the others who hide in offices while young men in the Army die.
