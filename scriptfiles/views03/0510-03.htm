<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Hailed as the White House's political genius, Karl Rove was as ebullient and unrevealing as the Great Oz in journeying here this week for no apparent reason. He seemed to be scouting restlessly for some Tin Man or Cowardly Lion among the passel of Democrats on the campaign road that passes through here next winter.

<p>"A complete nerd," Mr. Rove said by way of smiling self-introduction to political science students at St. Anselm College. 

<p>But a canny enough nerd at that. Crowds of political junkies reached to touch the hem of his garment, but Mr. Rove was no James Carville strewing raw-meat quotations of Machiavellian cuteness. He amiably disclosed very little about the president's re-election strategy. Until, that is, a student asked about the war in Iraq.

<p>"First of all, it's the battle of Iraq, not the war," Mr. Rove carefully corrected. He went on to describe a far larger and longer war against terrorism that he sees clearly, perchance fortuitously, stretching well toward Election Day 2004.

<p>If there were any doubt, Mr. Rove served notice to any and all Democratic challengers that feeding the aura of a wartime president, which has been bolstering Mr. Bush's standing in opinion polls by 15 points and more, would remain his campaigners' first priority across the next 18 months. 

<p>He made the Bush strategy clear: It's the terror, not the economy, stupid, even if the nation is suffering rolling deficits and relentless unemployment, and despite Mr. Bush's serial tax cuts for the captains of industry. Democrats may want to talk health care and other economic issues, but they will have to grapple their way through a patriotic blitz of a campaign, if Mr. Rove has his red-white-and-blue way. Democrats can rightly fear an "October surprise" coming color-coded by Tom Ridge next time around.

<p>"The country has not been hit since 9/11," Mr. Rove took care to note, as if tracking a new gross domestic product index as he fielded a question about the civil rights strictures of the Patriot Act.

<p>A few days earlier, the president was rarely mentioned in the opposition's primary debate in South Carolina, where nine Democrats tacitly conceded what a difficult target he is right now. When they cited the Iraq war it was mainly in excoriating one another's positions rather than Mr. Bush's handling of it. They could be seen struggling to work out believable critiques of the president's stewardship of homeland security within the bounds of patriotism and the confines of their long primary trek.

<p>The difficulty of the Democrats' task was exemplified after some party leaders tried to complain about political crassness in the president's cheeky performance in fighter pilot regalia at the carrier-deck victory tableau. Within half a news cycle, analysts turned back on the Democrats to ask whether they were already slipping into pre-emptive sore losing.

<p>"This is not a country built on envy," Mr. Rove advised. He was speaking of "confiscatory" federal taxes on the wealthy but offering a remark that serves well as a larger caution for campaigning Democrats. They can only watch next year when Mr. Bush carries out a grand Rove strategem and presides at a Republican renomination convention in the heart of Democratic New York City. This will be within staging distance of 9/11's ground zero, site of an earlier memorable scene of Mr. Bush atop the rubble, exhorting the nation through a bullhorn.

<p>Mr. Rove and the other Bush lieutenants know they cannot afford to be heavy-handed about the campaign implications of the New York visit. At the same time, Democrats must grudgingly concede that Mr. Bush is entitled as president to be leading a commemoration of the nation's continuing grief within days of his renomination.

<p>Mr. Rove seemed rather pleased at one student's question about whether the convention was designed to "play off the emotions of 9/11." With obvious relish, he alleged that it was the Democrats who had schemed too much in choosing a July convention in order to "booby-trap" the Republicans into a mid-August date, which would have left them competing for attention with the Summer Olympics in Athens. The choice of New York as August fades into September was the checkmate result, Mr. Rove said, not quite gloating but enjoying the opening call to battle.

<p>Mr. Rove is particularly curious about the Democrats' challenge in terms of a different sort of war. His true passion in the approaching fray seems to test fully a pet theory that in the current 50-50 standoff of the parties, even a narrow G.O.P. incumbency offers a whip-hand opportunity to secure a long-lasting party dominance. "That's the situation we face, and we are the governing party," Mr. Rove declared, alerting the students to what the Democrats already know.
