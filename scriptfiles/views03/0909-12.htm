<p>The single most hopeful inkling of the past two years in foreign policy occurred in Sunday night's presidential address, when President George W. Bush spent a couple of minutes of his 15-minute speech to support the notion of Iraq for the Iraqis. 
<p>He didn't put it quite that way, but he did mention the concept of an ``orderly transfer of sovereignty and authority to the Iraqi people." 
<p>He followed that up by referring to his belief in the Iraqi people's ability to ``govern themselves," and he discussed briefly the fact that all over Iraq, the local people are indeed trying to govern themselves. 
<p>Much credit should be given to the fact that, as Bush pointed out, ``90 percent of towns and cities [in Iraq] have local government." 
<p>This might be a good time to remember that those people have been there for 4,000 years, as have many of their towns and cities. Not to sound blindly hopeful, but even after the ravages of the Iran-Iraq war, the first Gulf War, and this invasion, Iraq's population still includes physicians, teachers and civil engineers. 
<p>Television news' emphasis on leading with blood can oversimplify and exaggerate the obstacles facing a whole population, overwhelmingly composed of people who just want to lead their lives. 
<p>The United States and other nations already charitably support a wonderful organization and simple reminder of human goodness called Doctors Without Borders. 
<p>If only we could have a Plumbers Without Borders, too. 
 
<p>This tiny bit of good news was reinforced by an article in Friday's Christian Science Monitor, suggesting that many Iraqis are indeed more than eager to take the reins of their own government. 
<p>To quote the article, ``The Constitutional Monarchy Movement, led by Sherif Ali bin Hussein - a Hashemite family prince who is considered by royalists to be the heir to the Iraqi monarchy deposed in 1958 - is organizing a conference of what he says will be approximately 500 political, professional, tribal and legal leaders from all over Iraq. 
<p>``The conference, which Mr. Hussein says will be held here later this month, will contest Washington's postwar approach in Iraq." 
<p>These people should probably be given all the tactful support we can give them. 
<p>The speech also contained correspondingly dark moments. Ethics aside, the darkest may have been Bush's stating that he will shortly ask Congress for ``resources" for his strategy. 
<p>He will ask for an appropriation of $87 billion for Iraq. Sad to say, $66 billion of that will be for ``military and intelligence operations" there, presumably leaving $21 billion to help the Iraqis rebuild. 
<p>The amount might be enough, at that, if Iraqi companies are hired, rather than Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney's old company. It's hard not to wonder exactly how the other $66 billion will be spent, though. 
<p>Guarding the oil fields in perpetuity? Employing Saddam Hussein's former secret service? 
<p>Funneling money to Vladimir Putin if, as rumored, Russia helped spirit Saddam out of Iraq? 
<p>Given this huge bill, and our needs here in this country, perhaps it's no wonder that Bush licked his lips at least 15 times in the 15 minutes. 
<p>Meanwhile, some of the things Bush did not say were also significant. He did not mention that his biggest campaign donors - and some of his own relatives - are profiting from Iraq. The name Halliburton did not come up (nor Cheney). 
<p>Halliburton's top shareholders were not mentioned, either, including the billionaire Wyly brothers. The Wylys anonymously funded a streak of ``environmental" attack ads against John McCain, knocking McCain out of the 2000 primaries when he was beating Bush. 
<p>Also not mentioned were Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, nor the fact that they sponsor suspect organizations and have ruling regimes, corrupt families, detested by their populations. 
<p>Early in his speech, Bush briefly asserted that Saddam had ``WMDs" (weapons of mass destruction). He did not mention that a U.S.-British report is scheduled to come out within days, saying that Saddam did not have WMDs. 
<p>With the ceaseless reiteration of the words ``terrorism" and ``terrorists," of course, there was no question raised about whether opposing an army of occupation is actually terrorism (traditionally defined as an attack against civilians). 
<p>Perhaps some day an occupant of the White House will remind us that no country has ever wanted to be invaded and occupied. 
<p>Bring the troops home.
