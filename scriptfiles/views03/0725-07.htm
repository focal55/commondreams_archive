<p>Since it started, I've avoided trying to write anything about our nation's war in Iraq, primarily because I find it immensely difficult to make much sense of what has taken place. But the nation's secretary of defense, I'm told, has written a book titled "Rumsfeld's Rules." I've not found occasion (or reason) to read it but, apparently, it contains such gems as "It's easier to get into a situation than to get out of one" or words to that effect. Clearly, it's a piece of advice he didn't share with his commander in chief before they decided to invade Iraq. It also goes a long way in helping me understand what has happened.

<p>It is now more than four months since that ill-fated adventure was launched and almost three since the announcement by President Bush that the military phase of the conquest was at an end. As the cover of the July 14 issue of Time magazine bluntly puts it: "Americans are still struggling to bring order out of chaos." An inside comment is even more candid: "Iraq is a mess" ... 146,000 U.S. soldiers, alongside the 600 civilians working for the Coalition Provisional Authority -- the United States' interim government for the country -- are "still struggling to police Iraq's streets, restore electricity, fix the economy, rebuild schools." All this in a nation that seems, for some strange reason, disinclined to show much gratitude for our having "liberated" it. 

<p>The latest report from the Pentagon indicates the cost of this effort has doubled from its initial estimates -- to $3.9 billion a month. This sum, we are told, is only for military operations. It does not include the costs of reconstruction from the wreckage left by the military campaign. It also does not include the $950 million per month we're having to pay for operations in Afghanistan where, incidentally, conditions -- with the exception of those in that nation's capital -- seem to be about the same as they were before we went in there 18 months ago.

<p>So, while state and local governments across the nation totter on the verge of bankruptcy, vital federal programs from AmeriCorps to the National Weather Service have their budgets slashed and unemployment is at a new high, we're approaching a monthly outlay of close to $5 billion for two wars, neither of which seem to have accomplished their principal objectives.

<p>Now it seems we want to lessen the military burden on our country by persuading our allies to support the rebuilding effort in Iraq. Having gone out of our way to tick off a goodly number of other nations that might have come to our aid, it will be a remarkable achievement if this happens. According to Rumsfeld, 19 nations now have soldiers in Iraq and another 19 have promised to send troops. Rumsfeld states that the allied troops already committed together with those promised totals 30,000; if my math is correct, that averages less than 800 troops per country. That is hardly a display of hearty allied support.

<p>All of this might not be so disturbing were it not for another cost that these wars are incurring. Every day now the morning news brings word of another U.S. soldier's death -- one and sometimes two or more at a time our young men and women in uniform are having to make the ultimate sacrifice while in the prime of their lives for a cause that remains unclear to vast numbers of Americans, not to mention the rest of the world. 

<p>This tragic situation is not likely to change anytime soon -- even the Pentagon acknowledges as much. Yet at some point, we will have to turn Iraq back to its citizens and, given the demographics of the country, inevitably this will mean a nation in which a Shiite majority holds the reins of political power. That reality likely will give us a nation that looks politically, and perhaps religiously, very much like its next-door neighbor -- Iran.

<p>We should get out of Iraq sooner rather than later. Why not admit that we've accomplished little of what was our announced intent -- we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein is more likely alive than dead and "democracy" in Iraq is likely to cause as many headaches for the United States as Saddam ostensibly did. Let's cut our losses, really support our troops and bring them home from the quagmire in Iraq.
