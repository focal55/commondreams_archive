<p>The Bush Administration announced Monday that former New York Times 
reporter Jayson Blair will replace Ari Fleischer as White House Press 
Secretary. 

<p>Known as a cautious and calculating press secretary who constantly 
ducks tough questions, Fleischer announced in May that he would 
resign between the invasions of Iraq and Iran to give the White House 
time to replace him. 

<p>"It's a good time to leave," said Fleischer. "How would you like to 
explain 60,000 major businesses filing for bankruptcy under Bush, a 
nose-diving dollar, three million people out of work, a record budget 
deficit, $95,000 tax cuts for millionaires, and increasing pollution?" 

<p>White House sources report that Jayson Blair, former staff reporter 
for the New York Times, will be offered for the job. Blair, who is 
known for widespread fabrication and plagiarism in his news articles, 
is considered a shoe-in for the job, although some doubt that Blair, 
by forging inaccuracies in only 36 out of 73 new stories, can keep up 
with White House demands. 

<p>"The White House requires telling many whoppers everyday, and this 
young man really knows how to spin the truth," said Victoria 
Darkness, a Pentagon spokeswoman. 

<p>Blair's strengths for the job include an ability to embellished 
madly, claiming to be places he has never visited and an egregious 
stealing of stories from other reporters. Critics find somewhat more 
troubling the fact that his errors and fabrications at the New York 
Times were mostly benign: They didn't start a war, execute an 
innocent person or undermine foreign governments. The Pentagon hopes 
that the New York Times charges that "the audacity of the deceptions 
grew by the week" will help Blair grow quickly into his role as White 
House press secretary. 

<p>"Americans love the colorful, subjective, and bogus details," said 
Darkness. "Blair enjoys the process of making up stories, creating 
better, more interesting and more effective stories to serve the 
interest of the Republican Party, the Pentagon and our wealthy 
benefactors. We look forward to his tenure." 

<p>Veteran reporters were not surprised at Fleischer's resignation, 
pointing out that he wears hip boots to press conferences where he 
explains that Iraq is not a quagmire. During a recent press 
conference, others detected grimaces instead of his usual stern, 
tight-lipped performance. "Fleischer shows superb control to keep 
from bursting out laughing at some of his explanations of Bush's 
policy," said one reporter. 

<p>Observers admitted they will miss Fleischer's "constant fibbing" and 
backtracking, and compare him favorably to former press secretaries 
like Pat Buchanan, who can't find a job, and Ron Ziegler, who helped 
Nixon cover up Watergate. "Watching him explain the famous 
'disappearing' weapons of mass destruction is hilarious," said one 
friend. 

<p>Rumors indicate that Fleischer resigned because he was angry at the 
White House press pool for not accepting his explanation of the Tooth 
Fairy, although Fleischer maintains he is quitting for "personal" 
reasons. Some claim his bride of six months is unhappy with his 
frequent absences and the excuse that he must attend late night White 
House "prayer meetings." His wife fears that he may no longer be able 
to distinguish fact from fiction and may lose his ability to speak 
coherently after spending so much time with the president. Fleischer 
denies the charges. 

<p>"Being press secretary is one big con job," said Fleischer. "It may 
be a charade, but it's easier than working for Exxon/Mobil or Grace 
Industries. All I have to do is tell the same story over and over 
until people believe it." 

<p>Although Fleischer refused to explain where he kissed the president 
after he announced his resignation, President Bush kissed him on the 
head. "Isn't he wonderful," said Bush. "We can tell him anything and 
he goes out and repeats it to the press corps. The guy has no shame." 

<p>Washington will miss Fleischer who had to meet more often with the 
press because President Bush held only eight press conferences, 
preferring to read from carefully scripted speeches due to a "garbled 
reasoning" syndrome brought on by his heavy alcohol consumption when 
he was in his forties. Recently, Fleischer's reasoning resembles that 
of the president's. 

<p>While defending Bush's plan to suspend collective bargaining for 
government employees, Fleischer told the press, "The president will 
have more authority to help protect the homeland if potatoes attacked 
America in the Department of Agriculture."
