<p>Welcome to political jeopardy. I'm your host, Sean "Little Alex Trebec" Gonsalves.
I'll take 'who would Jesus bomb?' for $800, Alex.

<p>OK, the answer is: "Because they can."

<p>Why did U.S. and British neocons trick the American public into supporting the invasion of Iraq?

<p>If you don't believe that's the correct answer, then it might be useful to do a comparative analysis of the Bush administration policy toward Iraq and North Korea.

<p>One of the most important lessons I've learned about international politics is that there's a huge gulf between political "reality" and what's happening "on the ground," as it were.

<p>Apparently, the failure to make this distinction has scared a large segment of the voting public into backing the hard-hearted, soft-headed policies in place now, with the help of a narrowly focused "liberal" news media.

<p>Seung Hye Suh <i>(see <a href="http://www.nodutdol.com" target="_new">www.nodutdol.com</a>)</i>, an organizer with the group Nodutdol for Korean Community Development and assistant professor at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., points out the danger of the North Korean situation.

<p>"The U.S. has included North Korea on a list of possible nuclear first-strike targets (check out the Rumsfeld-led 'Operations Plan 5030').

<p>"North Korea...has committed to dismantling its (nuclear) program if the U.S. guarantees it will not attack. Given the experience of Iraq once it gave up weapons without such a guarantee, who can blame the North Koreans? Most Americans don't know that the Korean War is still not officially over."

<p>Martin Hart-Landsberg, Lewis and Clark College professor and adjunct researcher at the Institute for Social Sciences at Gyeongsang National University in South Korea, reminds us "it was the U.S. government that first introduced the threat of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. It stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea beginning in 1957, and engaged in simulated nuclear attacks against the North in the 1980s. The U.S. itself violated the Framework Agreement, which called for, among other things, progress towards normalization of relations and an end to the economic embargo."

<p>Turning to Iraq, Susan Schuman, whose son Justin is currently serving in Baghdad, offers this: "(My son) said to me, 'The U.S. just doesn't understand. There are 30 to 40 major incidents here a day and the U.S. news does not report that. The news only shows one or two incidents, only talks about one or two deaths or one or two illnesses.' The ground truth...is chaos, lack of planning, lack of basic supplies and equipment, lack of personnel. Our soldiers are demoralized. They are fighting in the illegal and unjustified war.

<p>"Meanwhile, at home Bush is cutting veterans benefits and assistance to military children and families."

<p>Where's the "support-our- troops" war cheerleaders when you need 'em?

<p>What to do? I think it's fairly obvious that we ought to sit down at the negotiating table with North Korea.

<p>Regarding Iraq, Phyllis Bennis, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, offers several propositions:

<p>
<ul>
<li> Oppose any new U.N. resolution aimed at providing more legitimacy for the U.S.-U.K. (illegal) occupation of Iraq.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Bush administration should immediately release a detailed timetable of plans to end the occupation and turn over power to Iraqis.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>As an occupation force, the U.S. and the U.K. are required to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. The U.S. should immediately make public a realistic estimate for the cost of reconstruction in Iraq, and Washington should turn those funds over to the U.N., beginning with a direct grant of at least $75 billion (the initial amount spent on waging the war) for reconstruction work. These funds could be raised from an "excess profits tax" on corporations benefiting from the war and post-war privatization, as well as from Pentagon budget lines initially aimed at carrying out war in Iraq.

</li>
</ul>
<p>The neocons don't have a monopoly on ideas. In fact, those who love America enough to call on it to be its best have a few of their own, too.
