<p>The deadly terror attack last week against an American diplomatic convoy in the northern Gaza Strip may represent a significant new and troubling dimension to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict - the killing of Americans.
<p> As long as the perpetrators and purpose of the bombing remain unknown, though, it will be difficult to gauge its immediate impact on the wider Arab-Israeli situation. Whether this is an isolated incident, an expansion of the local conflict to include explicit American involvement, an offshoot of the situation in Iraq, or a new front in the war between the United States and global terror groups will become clear only in the weeks ahead.
<p> Whoever bombed the American convoy was probably motivated by one of two factors: intense anger at U.S. Middle East policy, which Palestinians see as disproportionately pro-Israeli, and anti-American sentiments that are part and parcel of the attacks against the U.S. forces in Iraq.
<p> Nobody has claimed responsibility for the blast, though the Palestinian Authority has already arrested several suspects from a relatively secretive group called the Popular Resistance Committees. Notably, though, Palestinian Authority forces were met with gunfire when they tried to arrest the suspects in the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza. Several people were taken into custody, but others escaped.
<p> The attack will surely heighten intra-Palestinian tensions in the short run, as the Palestinian Authority headed by Yasser Arafat cracks down on suspected militants in an attempt to rehabilitate itself with the United States and Israel.
<p> Two other consequences are likely. Israel could accelerate its attacks and political pressure against Arafat's mainstream forces as well as the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups who have carried out suicide bombings against Israeli targets. Israel has been doing this in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, where troops have made three large-scale military incursions. Or the United States itself might directly attack the perpetrators of the bombing, if it can identify them with certainty. The problem with this response is that Israel has tried it for years now without success.
<p> A military response would mesh with views of Palestinian bombers as part of the global terror network that the United States is fighting around the world. Palestinians and most of the world, however, see Palestinian terror as a desperate response by a few militants to the 36-year-old Israeli occupation and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Attacks against Israel, this argument goes, will end when the Israelis end their occupation.
<p> A recent poll from the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research again confirmed seemingly contradictory sentiments among the Palestinian public: 75 percent approve of the recent suicide attack against a caf&#233; in Haifa that left 21 dead, but 85 percent support the idea of a mutual cease-fire with Israel. This reflects the widespread feeling among Palestinians that they should resist the Israeli occupation by force if necessary, but also strive for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The public would see a Palestinian Authority crackdown on militants - without a simultaneous end to Israeli attacks, assassinations and land grabs - as unacceptable capitulation to Israeli and U.S. dictates.
<p> This is a mirror image of the widespread Israeli sentiment that refuses to withdraw from occupied lands, stop expanding settlements or halt assassinations of Palestinian militants while some Palestinians continue to carry out suicide bombings and other terror tactics against Israeli civilians. Both sides are prepared to fight, but prefer to negotiate.
<p> The attack in Gaza ultimately emphasizes the need for political solutions to a political problem. Military might used by a sovereign state or terror attacks by renegade groups are part of the problem of the cycle of violence that has long defined the Arab-Israeli conflict, and that now threatens to pull in the United States as an active partner.
