<p>A nation hooked on reality TV needs to click over to the UN Security 
Council for some real drama.

<p>The wrangling over the upcoming vote on war in Iraq has a lot in common 
with shows like "Survivor" and "Marry a Millionaire" - the scheming, the
shedding of old alliances like used tissue, the catty name-calling and 
vows of revenge, even the constant viewer scrutiny.

<p>A U.S. official memo leaked to the London-based Observer <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0302-01.htm">revealed a plan</a> hatched last month to conduct surveillance on the homes and offices of 
ambassadors from countries elected to the Security Council.  American 
spies are listening in to the ambassadors' private conversations, hoping
they'll hear something that might help manipulate votes on a UN 
resolution authorizing war in Iraq.  The prime targets of the bugging 
offensive are ambassadors from six countries that hold elected seats on 
the Council (Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Bulgaria, Guinea, and Pakistan).

<p>Although Mexico, another Security Council member, was not highlighted on
the bugging list, it has suffered a more public humiliation.  The days 
when President Bush bonded over cowboy boots with Mexican President 
Vicente Fox are a distant memory.  In a Survivor-esque twist, Bush 
turned on his friend, unleashing an envoy last week to issue 
thinly-veiled threats in reaction to Fox's outspoken opposition to war. 
  According to the Washington Post, Ambassador Tony Garza said that 
Mexico could expect real trouble over U.S. legislation on issues like 
immigration and trade if it voted against the U.S. resolution 
authorizing war.

<p>If you've wondered if "Bachelor" Bush would choose war over free trade, 
you need to surf no further than Security Council member Chile.  Last 
December, U.S. and Chilean negotiators finally completed a trade deal 
that had been promised to Chile nearly 10 years ago.  Unfortunately for 
the Chilean government, it joined the Security Council that same month. 
  President Bush has not submitted the trade deal for Congressional 
approval, with Chile's support for war likely the price for doing so.

<p>The intensity and sliminess of the U.S. pressure campaign has stoked 
outrage around the globe.  Here at home, the reaction is amusement. 
Witness the sarcastic thrashing of Bush's so-called "Coalition of the 
Willing" - we've got Coalition of the Billing, Coalition of the 
Shilling, COW (cuz we're getting milked), and Rent-a-Coalition. 
Cartoonists have depicted Bush buying coalition members on eBay and 
upping his numbers by renaming his advisers the "Republic of Don" and 
"Cheneystan."

<p>But this get-out-the-vote rampage should be more than an entertaining 
game to Americans.  The Administration's goal is to create the illusion 
that the war effort would represent genuine multilateralism.  This is 
important to Bush, since almost every poll indicates that most Americans
don't want to go to war alone.  Americans should be outraged that they 
are being courted by a "consensus" as phony as Joe Millionaire's millions.

<p>If people do indeed care about the UN, then they should care about the 
integrity of UN actions, especially when so many lives hang in the 
balance.  President Bush has warned that the UN is "on the road to 
irrelevance" if it does not authorize war in Iraq.  But how relevant 
will this body be if decisions are not based on international law, but 
instead result from bribing, bullying, and bugging?  Even if the 
Administration wins passage of a second resolution, their clumsy 
arm-twisting campaign has guaranteed that the result will be seen as a 
joke.

<p>One thing that the networks love about reality shows is that they are 
inexpensive to produce.  Not so for Bush's war - the arm-twisters are 
offering boatloads of taxpayer money to buy support for the war.  The 
Turkish government, for instance, was offered $6 billion in grants in 
exchange for its support of the war and approval of U.S. use of its 
bases.  If Turkey's final answer remains "no," the Administration ought 
to consider using the money to buy support from cash-strapped 
communities here at home, more than 120 of which have passed resolutions
opposing preemptive war.

<p>As of the latest episode, the UN Ambassadors and national leaders of the
Security Council countries were standing up amazingly well to the U.S. 
onslaught.  Their strength lies in the overwhelming opposition to war of
the people, not only in their own countries, but around the world as 
well.  As the drama heads towards the grand finale vote, Americans need 
to make it clear that they want more from their President than the wily 
victors on "Survivor."  They want a commitment to real multilateralism 
and real democracy.  If the United States hopes to be a real global 
leader, there is no other choice.
