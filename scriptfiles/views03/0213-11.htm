<p>Hangers-on always surround the rich and powerful. They laugh at bad jokes, nod at pretentious ideas and follow questionable orders. <P></P>Some sacrifice the sovereignty of their conscience for a livelihood, others for lesser favours &#8212; a seat on a corporate board or an invitation to the next dinner of the charmed circle. A similar subservient existence is being recommended for Canada vis-à-vis the United States, and not by Brian Mulroney alone.<P></P> The king of schmooze is echoing business and right-wing circles in advocating an axis of convenience between Ottawa and Washington.<P></P> The idea seems to float well above the rights and wrongs of the impending war on Iraq. The case is simple: Being a courtier to the White House will earn us brownie points, cashable later for valuable contacts and lucrative contracts.<P></P> British ministers and diplomats offer just such a rationale in private conversations to justify Tony Blair's unquestioning solidarity with George W. Bush: It will be good for Britain.<P></P>There is little room in this exalted thinking for the lowly public. There is nary a mention that an overwhelming majority of Britons and Canadians oppose such an obsequious style of leadership as well as the substance of the issue at hand, an American-driven and American-led invasion of Iraq.<P></P> Sharing the disdain for voter concerns are Stephen Harper and the Canadian Alliance, self-proclaimed champions of grassroots democracy. <P></P>The preachers of free votes in Parliament are mum just when the Liberal caucus is full of doubters on Iraq looking to vote their conscience. <P></P>One shouldn't be surprised. Didn't Harper rush to Fox-TV to offer a grovelling apology to Americans for some alleged misdeed of the elected government of Canada? <P></P>That the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition can't make up his mind whether he works for Americans or Canadians is emblematic of the times. The crisis over Iraq has emboldened those Canadians who labour under the inferiority complex that the best course for Canada is to fold itself into America.<P></P>If there ever was an issue on which Canada should stick to its principles, as well as the public will, the proposed invasion of Iraq is it. <P></P>Jean Chr&#233;tien is well-advised to keep ignoring the calls of American acolytes here. He should keep insisting that Canada would not join the war unless specifically approved by the United Nations.<P></P>Canada's hands are cleanest, unlike Russia's or France's, which have economic interests in Iraq. With no colonial past, no pretensions to hegemony and no sizeable stake in Iraqi oil, our principled position can serve as a model for the world.<P></P>Chr&#233;tien should take heart from the daily riveting drama of "people power" holding the world's most powerful military and economic power to a draw, so far. In fact, the more the Bush administration presses relentlessly for war, the greater the public and governmental resistance everywhere.<P></P>Besides the legal and moral weakness of its case, Washington is paying a heavy price for its arrogant unilateralism and for insulting everyone daring to question it. <P></P>The democratically elected governments of France and Germany are dismissed as "old Europe." The United Nations is told it is facing "irrelevance" and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "a crisis of credibility" and forced into the worst crisis in its 54-year history.<P></P>America has become its own worst enemy.<P></P> It has a strong case for forcing Saddam Hussein to live up to his many obligations under a dozen Security Council resolutions dating back to the end of the 1991 Gulf War. It is also right to have been calling for unity in dealing with him. <P></P>But in its desire to march to its own drumbeat and in its need to drag a reluctant American public into war by exploiting its worst post-Sept. 11 fears, the Bush administration has concentrated less on conducting statecraft and diplomacy than on mounting a propaganda blitz, and a crude one at that.<P></P> Even Colin Powell, called "a strategic asset" by the White House, is losing credibility by the day. The strong components of his Security Council presentation last week &#8212; Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction and its non-co-operation with the United Nations inspectors &#8212; are increasingly lost in the questions being raised about his exaggerated assertions of Iraqi capability and his factually shaky and largely unconvincing allegations linking Iraq to Al Qaeda.<P></P>Powell went further down the same slippery slope this week. Commenting on Osama bin Laden's latest tape, the secretary of state surmised: "Once again, he speaks ... how he is in partnership with Iraq." No, he doesn't. The terrorist urges Iraqis to rise up if America invades. That's not the same thing as "an unholy partnership" with Saddam, as America declared yesterday.<P></P>As we head for a showdown, first among the allies themselves, Canada's stance is clear: We won't waver from our most fundamental principle of peaceful multilateralism.
