<p> MY FRIEND JANE brought her two granddaughters to the anti-war march in 
San Francisco last Saturday because she wanted them to learn about the right 
to dissent in a democracy.
<P>Under a dazzling, blue sky, they joined a huge crowd of more than 150,000 
people who slowly squeezed through Market Street to express their opposition 
to a likely war with Iraq.
<P>Everywhere I looked, people seemed to be on their best behavior. Jammed 
into BART trains, people gave up seats to the disabled, parents with children 
and the elderly. Instead of pushing and shoving, they assisted ailing 
strangers and helped reunite terrified children with their frantic parents. 
Though the march moved at a glacial pace, people exhibited immense patience. 
There was, as one friend put it, a "sweet manifestation of a take-care-of-each-
other mood."
<P>The crowd looked very much like a snapshot of California, with people of 
all ages and of every ethnic and racial group walking and chatting with their 
friends and families. Though I saw many veteran middle-aged activists, what 
most impressed me was the spirited energy that huge numbers of high school and 
college students brought to the march.
<P>To view the crowd was like looking at a kaleidoscope of the greater Bay 
Area. Veterans of the Vietnam War era -- both soldiers and activists -- walked 
next to younger suburban dads whose small children rode on their shoulders. A 
baby brigade of mothers with strollers mingled with puppets and clowns from 
Mendocino County. Masked undocumented workers walked next to environmentalists 
who drove down from Grace Cathedral in their electric vehicles.
<P>Crowds on the sidewalk cheered as members of a coalition of 50 labor unions 
passed by, proudly carrying a street-wide banner, "Labor Against the War." 
Peace activists from Arizona and Alaska received rousing applause for 
traveling so far to oppose the war.
<P>The signs, as always, said it all. "This is my Patriot Act" and "Stop Clear 
Cutting Our Civil Rights" reflected widespread concern about government 
secrecy and violations of civil rights at home. "Corporate terrorists have 
hijacked our government," "Regime change begins at home," and "Don't blame me -
- I voted with the majority" won approving smiles from many protesters. "How 
did our oil get under their sand?" required no comment and drew many laughs 
from the crowd. One dog, who received a lot of coddling from children, padded 
around with a sign, "Throw balls, not bombs."
<P>One man stood silently with a handwritten sign, "I want to be a proud 
American." I asked him what he meant. "I don't want my country to violate its 
democratic principles -- not here, not anywhere."
<P>As thousands of people poured into Civic Center, you could hear Martin 
Sheen, the actor who plays the liberal President Jed Bartlett on the popular 
television series "The West Wing," tell the crowd, "You know what I do for a 
living, but this is what I do to stay alive!" The crowd exploded in cheers and 
applause. "Let my country awake," he thundered. "We want to end the long and 
shameful silence."
<P>It was a bizarre, even surreal moment. The crowd clearly preferred the 
words of this man, who plays the president, to the policies of our actual 
leader. For one split second, it seemed as if the Bay Area existed in a 
parallel universe, with its very own president.
<P>Many carried American flags. But what made the event feel extraordinary -- 
and patriotic -- was that so many ordinary Americans, many for the first time, 
gave up a Saturday to protest their government's threat to wage a war with 
Iraq.
<P>Nothing could be more American. This is the lesson that thousands of people, including Jane's two little granddaughters, learned that day.
