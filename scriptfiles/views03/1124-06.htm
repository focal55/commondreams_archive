<p>President Bush and his business allies claim that the Free Trade Area of the Americas trading and investment agreement they are trying to negotiate would be good for the United States and the rest of the Western Hemisphere. But the people Bush says the FTAA would benefit disagree strongly. 

<p>Negotiators from the United States and representatives of the multinational business interests that would be the real beneficiaries of the proposed free trade zone from Canada to Chile gathered in Miami last week to begin forging a deal. Outside, thousands of labor, environmental, religious and human rights activists from North and South America showed up to say they do not want their countries shackled to a "NAFTA on steroids" trade agreement that would undermine the ability of citizens to organize for better pay and working conditions, implement necessary environmental regulations and sound consumer protections, and ensure that corporations are held to account. 

<p>Unfortunately, the government negotiators had little contact with the people. They were separated from the crowds by thousands of armed police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets to ensure that peaceful demonstrators did not have a chance to be heard. Wisconsin AFL-CIO President David Newby, one of dozens of Wisconsinites who joined the rallies and marches against corporate-dictated free trade in general and the FTAA in particular, described the scene as a "police state." 

<p>The next time President Bush starts touting the virtues of corporate-dictated free trade, the Washington press corps might want to ask: If the FTAA really offers all the benefits you claim, why was an army required to keep the people out of the discussion in Miami?
