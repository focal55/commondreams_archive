<p> QALQILYA, West Bank— If you want to understand the dispute over the barrier that Israel is constructing to keep out Palestinian terrorists — a twisting mix of barbed-wire fencing, electronic sensors, guard towers and concrete walls — this economically depressed Palestinian town of 40,000 is worth a visit. Qalqilya sits next to the Israeli town of Kfar Sava. It was from here two years ago that a suicide bomber slipped into Israel and massacred 21 youngsters outside a seaside Tel Aviv discothèque. Hundreds more Israelis have been killed since then, and many of the murderers came from this part of the West Bank.

<p> Throughout history, walls have been built to keep out enemy armies, with some success. The Israelis have a more modest, yet equally urgent, goal — to stop fanatical, homicidal groups and individuals — and Israeli military officers say they are already finding the barrier useful. They say the constructed part of the fence is keeping terrorists out and point out that no suicide bomber has entered Israel from the Gaza Strip in recent years because Gaza's entire border is fenced off. Why not do the same along the West Bank? Since the only hope for the Middle East conflict is to divide this land into two states, creating a physical barrier that cleanly divides the two mistrustful peoples may seem like a reasonable idea for now.

<p> The problem is that is not what is happening. The fence is not being built on the likely border between two future states but is snaking into the West Bank in ways that make daily life, already burdensome, even harder for Palestinians. Qalqilya is not only blocked off from Israel to its west. It is entirely surrounded by the barrier so it will be isolated it from West Bank Jewish settlements to its east. The result for Qalqilya is that it has become — there is no other word for it — a ghetto, a term with chilling resonance for Jews whose forbears were restricted to such areas across Europe not many generations ago.

<p> This is hardly the only cruel irony of the barrier. Built by the hawkish government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, it was conceived by the doves of the opposition Labor Party. Mr. Sharon long opposed its construction for the very reasons they championed it — he did not want to see it serve as a de facto border between the Jewish state and the emerging Palestinian one because his beloved West Bank settlements would then be isolated and imperiled.

<p> What has happened is that Mr. Sharon has hijacked the barrier plan. Instead of it serving to start the separation needed for a fair, two-state solution, it is being built to incorporate settlements, imposing additional hardship on Palestinians. A reasonable idea aimed at improving the chance of peace has thus been turned into a source of conflict.

<p> The problems created for the Palestinians are many. A large chunk of Qalqilya's arable land — locals claim that it amounts to one-third — has been taken over by the barrier, with devastating economic results. Farmers cannot get to their fields. Relatives from other towns or villages cannot come in and out, except through a single checkpoint. Israeli military officials say that once the various gates and systems are worked out, the difficulties created for Palestinians will ease. Such assurances have been understandably received with skepticism.

<p> When the barrier's construction was begun a little more than a year ago, the Bush administration had no complaints. Building began in the north and largely followed the Green Line, which was Israel's border until 1967. But as the barrier has worked its way south, its path has begun to diverge in numerous ways. Palestinians raised their concerns, and the administration properly took note.

<p> Israel says it will not go ahead with the construction of the most controversial parts of the barrier but will modify its plans and present them to Washington. That is a start. Some are urging the administration to go further and deduct the cost of the barrier's diversions from American loan guarantees. American law bars its aid from being used for West Bank settlement construction or support. This seems like an idea worthy of exploration, but the cost of the diversions is unlikely to be very high, so the effect of such a withholding of funds would not be great.


<p> The solution to the barrier problem lies in finally grasping the nettle of Jewish settlement in the West Bank. The settlements not only take land from a future Palestinian state, but the bypass roads — and now the protective barrier — deepen the problem. The Mideast peace plan, known as the road map, calls for freezing settlement growth and removing recent settlement outposts. Neither is happening. Instead, a barrier is being built that is adding to the problem, rather than helping to create a solution.
