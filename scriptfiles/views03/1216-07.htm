<p>You can't swing a picket sign in the Bay Area without hitting a "Defoliate Bush'' button on someone's "Vote for Peace'' T-shirt. You're more likely to spot cars bearing "No War in Iraq'' bumper stickers than "My child is an honor student at . . .'' To the rest of the country, the Bay Area is an island of radicalism, as fierce and out-of-touch as any Christian Coalition zealot. 

<p>There is some truth to this. But what is also true is that the ferocity that gave birth in the past year to protest marches and anti-war organizations serves a continuing, crucial purpose. It ensures that, despite months of spin and photo ops, there are voices reminding us of Bush's original rationale for the immediate invasion of Iraq, without waiting for international support: 

<p>There was imminent danger from weapons of mass destruction. 

<p>That's why the reaction to Saddam Hussein's capture might be a bit more subdued here than in other places. 

<p>"It's kind of a diversion,'' said Jackie Cabasso, executive director of the Western States Legal Foundation, a nuclear disarmament advocacy group based in the East Bay. "It doesn't change the basic situation on the ground in Iraq. It doesn't make the U.S. right for going in there. This war was sold on a whole set of lies. Capturing Saddam Hussein doesn't change that.'' 

<p>Don't misunderstand. There is enormous relief and satisfaction in seeing television footage of Saddam so helpless and pathetic in his rat hole. His capture means, finally, a measure of justice for all the people he imprisoned, killed and tortured. There is something hopeful, too, in knowing that all his millions of dollars couldn't save him from a life of hot dogs and Mars bars as he dashed from one dilapidated farm house to another. 

<p>No matter what you think about the war, the world is better off with Saddam locked away in prison, reduced to a scared, ragged old man, utterly alone. 

<p>But as Cabasso and other Bay Area peace activists pointed out yesterday, if the American people had been asked last spring if bringing Saddam to justice -- as opposed to, say, the dictators in Burma or North Korea or Congo or any number of other countries -- was worth the billions in expenditures and the lives of their sons and daughters, they would have said no. Without hesitation. 

<p>So while capturing Saddam is good and welcome news, it hardly is the triumphant vindication for invasion that the Bush administration wants to portray. 

<p>"This wasn't what the war was supposed to be about,'' said Medea Benjamin, founding director of Global Exchange, a human rights organization based in San Francisco. She just returned from 10 days in Iraq and then New York, where she spoke with members of the United Nations Security Council. 

<p>"Gloating over Hussein's capture doesn't make the situation over there any prettier. It's a mess. Things are not going well. And the international community is saying, 'The U.S. got itself into this mess, we're not going to send our troops in there to die, too.' '' 

<p>If we can take Bush at his word, then Saddam's capture should mark the beginning of the war's end. We feared nuclear weapons, Bush said, even if Iraq didn't have an actual weapon yet, because Saddam was such a madman. He was so intent on destroying the U.S., we were told, that he eventually would find a way to build something capable of mass destruction. So we had to get in there before it was too late. After the tragedy of Sept. 11, national security adviser Condoleeza Rice said repeatedly, the American people would rather be safe than sorry. That's what justified the preemptive strike. 

<p>So with Saddam gone, the threat of nuclear war has gone with him. No more madman at the controls. This also means a new Iraqi government can take over without the threat of Saddam regaining power. It means we can withdraw our troops and provide only technical support for rebuilding what we destroyed. 

<p>"If this was indeed about liberating the poor people of Iraq,'' Benjamin said "then let the liberation begin.'' 

<p>Sometimes the Bay Area can go too far in its lefty, dogmatic beliefs. We are to liberalism what Hollywood is to film or Gilroy to garlic. But when the stakes are this high, when young men and women are dying every day, there have to be people in the back of the parade waving their hands and yelling, "Wait! Remember why we went to war? Are we doing what we should be doing? How does all of this serve America's purposes and ideals?'' 


<p>Maybe some call that radicalism. I don't want to ruin the Bay Area's reputation, but I think it sounds an awful lot like common sense. Even patriotism.
