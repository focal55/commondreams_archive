<p>It was clear to anyone who followed the
negotiations closely in Miami that the
ministerial meeting of the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA) was at least as much of a
failure as the collapse of the WTO talks in
Cancun in September. The difference was that
this time the U.S. and Brazil papered over their
differences in front of the cameras.

<p>But the ministers skipped town a day
early, knowing that the longer they stayed, the
more likely it was that their façade of diplomatic
pleasantries would crumple.

<p>The political rifts between the U.S.
delegation and Brazil -- with the latter quietly
supported by much of the rest of Latin America
-- were widely reported, in both Cancun and
Miami. But there is a very important economic
basis for the widespread public skepticism of
the FTAA among Latin Americans. This
underlying economic reality has received almost
no attention.

<p>The Latin American region is suffering
through an enormously long, profound
economic slump, which has followed in the
wake of a series of economic reforms that began
in the 1980s. These reforms, known collectively
in Latin America as "neoliberalism," have
included high interest rates, tight fiscal
discipline, large-scale privatizations, and the
replacement of development policies with a
simplistic opening to international trade and
investment flows.

<p>The reforms, also known as "the
Washington Consensus," were supposed to
promote economic growth. But as any
economist can verify, they have failed
spectacularly.

<p>For the two decades from 1980 through
1999, income per person in the region grew by a
paltry 11 percent. In the previous two decades
(1960-1979), it grew by 80 percent.

<p>And we now have data for the first half
of the present decade (2000 through 2004),
using IMF projections for next year. Even with
these optimistic projections for 2004, there has
been almost no growth in income per person:
one percent for the whole five years. The
present decade is looking like another "lost
decade," as the 1980s are sadly known.

<p>There has been no long-term economic
failure of this magnitude in Latin America for
more than a century, even if the years of the
Great Depression are included.

<p>And this says nothing about the
distribution of income, which has probably
worsened over the last quarter century. But
income per person is the most basic measure of
human welfare that economists have. And it is
generally difficult -- if not impossible -- to
improve the living standards of poor people in
developing countries without increasing overall
income (or GDP).

<p>When the economy grows, it is
sometimes possible to direct more of the new
income and wealth to those who need it most.
When it does not grow, the only way to raise the
living standards of the poor is to take from the
non-poor. As a practical matter, this is generally
not feasible.

<p>After nine years of negotiations, the
ministers in Miami could only agree to continue
talks on a scaled-down version of the FTAA.
Left to an uncertain future were some of the
biggest non-trade items: rules on intellectual
property, investment, and government
procurement.

<p>These things do not belong in trade
agreements, as some of the most pro-trade
economists have acknowledged. Patents and
copyrights are, from a purely economic
viewpoint, the most costly forms of
protectionism in the world. And the investment
rules that the United States is seeking would
make it more difficult for developing countries
to use foreign investment for their own
development needs.

<p>But these non-trade items are the most
lucrative and important to U.S. business
interests, and Washington is unlikely to
conclude any agreement without them. So the
future of the FTAA is very much in doubt.

<p>The demise of the FTAA will not by
itself put an end to Latin America's long
economic malaise. To restore the reasonable
growth rates of the past will require new
economic policies. Among the most important
will be lower interest rates -- Brazil, for
example, is mired in recession right now with
short-term rates set at 17.5 percent (as compared
to 1 percent set by the Federal Reserve in the
United States).

<p>But the failed negotiations at Miami and
Cancun are an acknowledgement that
Washington's formula for growth is wrong, and
should not be locked-in further with new
international treaties. At the very least, this
opens the possibility for development and
progress.
