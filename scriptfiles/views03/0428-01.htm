<p>What with Shia and Sunni and Ba'ath and imams and Syria and Abu Mazer and 
WMDs, it's no wonder many are confused in this post-Iraq-war period. Time 
once again to turn to that franchised series of books for easy-to-comprehend 
answers to difficult questions.

<p>Q. What happened? First the U.S. was bogged down in Iraq and it looked like 
deja Vietnam quagmire all over again, and then suddenly, without much of a 
fight, the U.S. sweeps into Baghdad and it's all over but the cheering. 

<p>A. The U.S. military wasn't quite ready, but the Hothead Hardliners in the 
Bush Administration didn't want to wait one more second -- they were 
terrified of getting bogged down in diplomacy and thus being prevented from 
launching their war. So, even though they had no Turkish base from where they 
could insert their infantry into Northern Iraq, they hastily entered from the 
South, which meant a long, hard slog up to Baghdad. They were unprepared for 
the welcoming fire they got in the South, and, at first, didn't have enough 
troops to battle all the forces that were attacking them and that were holed 
up in the cities along the route to Baghdad.

<p>But U.S. superiority in terms of computers, airbombing, artillery and tanks 
finally kicked in, and the troops began a fast track to Baghdad, outracing 
their supply lines. Reportedly, some deals were struck with various Iraqi 
military generals in Baghdad -- offering them everything from money and 
post-war positions and even U.S. citizenship -- and Saddam's Republican Guard 
divisions melted away. Note: It's conceivable they could be reconstituted, if 
things play out their way.

<p>Q. And how are things playing out? True, no WMDs ever were discovered, but 
from what I can see, the U.S. achieved a smashing victory and got what it 
wanted. It's in total military command of the country, and has set about

repairing the electrical grid, the waterworks, etc. It even got the oil 
flowing again. Why would the Saddam forces even think about regrouping and 
taking on the U.S.? 

<p>A. As was the case in Vietnam, and then again in Afghanistan, Pentagon 
strategists never fully appreciated the strength of nationalistic pride, or 
the repetitive historic cycle of wars against invaders. There are huge 
sectors of the Iraqi population grateful to the U.S. for getting rid of their 
brutal dictator for them -- both Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims -- but now they 
want the U.S. military to leave and let them sort out the future of their 
country by themselves.

<p>(Note: The U.S. now needs the former government's officials and technicians 
to help get the country back up and running. Translated, that means some

elements of the old Ba'athist structure will be back in positions of power; 
for those Saddam forces in exile or who melted into the civilian population, 
that will be the key to reconstituting their forces -- that and the genuine 
anti-U.S. feelings among many, stirred up by religious clerics anxious to 
assert their power now that the secular regime has fallen.)

<p>Many Iraqis don't trust the Bush Administration's motives in the slightest. 
They think the U.S. is there to set up stealth colonial-type institutions, 
tie corrupt entrepreneurs into shady deals that will benefit mainly outside 
corporations (and not just regarding oil), establish a secular government 
beholden to the U.S., use Iraqi bases for asserting its military power 
against other Muslim governments in the region, etc. By and large, they are 
spot-on.

<p>Q. But I thought the U.S. went in there to liberate the Iraqi people. Bush 
says we won't stay there one more day than is necessary. You don't believe 
him?

<p>A. He's telling the truth. But the key question is "necessary for whom?" Once 
he's got a friendly interim government installed, once the U.S. corporations 
such as Halliburton and Bechtel set up "reconstruction" shop, once the use of 
the military bases is worked out with the new government, once the oil is 
flowing fully again (with that U.S.-friendly government in charge, and 
outside oil companies handling part of the business), then the bulk of the 
U.S. military will be out of there. 

<p>But there's a possible catch. The Pentagon strategists, you see, never really 
thought through the post-Iraq phase of the war. For one thing, they just

assumed they'd find the dread WMDs, thus legitimizing their invasion; egg on 
the face time. They're also now forced to recognize that they might have won 
the battle -- and broke the spine of Saddam's cruel regime -- but they may 
well lose the war, both inside Iraq and in the Arab region in general.

<p>Q. How can they lose the war? There is no military rival that can stand up to 
them, either inside Iraq or outside.

<p>A. What U.S. officials are learning, to their surprise and horror, is that 
you can have the strongest military in the world and still not be able to 
control the population, especially when that population thinks you're on

their sacred homeland for nefarious purposes.

<p>And the U.S., clueless as usual, continues to permit things that are anathema 
to the population. Such as: permitting missionaries into the country to 
attempt to Christianize the Muslim citizenry; Bush has approved Franklin

Graham (Billy's son) and his missionaries being let loose in Iraq. Graham on 
several occasions has denounced Islam as a "very evil and wicked religion," 
making Muslims just a tad suspicious of the man.

<p>Because the Saddam regime collapsed so quickly -- the U.S. experienced a

"catastrophic success," said Rumsfeld -- and the U.S. had no ready-to-go

post-war plan worked out for Iraq, Islamic clerics stepped into the breech 
and began exercising their influence, with the more fundamentalist among them 
drawing huge crowds for once-banned religious ceremonies and anti-U.S. 
rallies. The U.S.-sponsored exiled opposition leaders, like Ahmad Chalabi and 
others, are regarded as corrupt lackeys of the U.S. and are not likely to 
generate popular support -- and, if the Pentagon Hardliners manage to install 
him into power anyway, you can expect both a civil war and near-total 
opposition to the U.S. forces on the ground.  

<p>The U.S. is now having to face the possibility that, unless they can engineer 
a popular secular interim government soon that will assume control, the 
democratic tiger they are riding into Iraq may yield a radical Islamist 
regime, despite Rumsfeld's warning that the U.S. won't let that happen. 
Nobody is quite sure what the long-range implications of an Islamist regime 
would mean, except that it most probably wouldn't mean anything good for the 
Americans: All their blood and treasure will have been spent for nothing, and 
bye bye, Bush, in the 2004 election. 

<p>So, you see, the Hardliners in the Bush Administration are almost forced into 
staying the course in Iraq, trying to pull the democratic rabbit out of the 
Islamic hat, thus risking geopolitical disaster if it goes wrong. 

<p>Q. You keep talking about "Hardliners" in the Bush Administration. Who are 
they? How much influence do they have, and what are their motives?

<p>A. By and large, we're referring to the Project for the New American Century 
(PNAC) ideologues who, after a decade on the outside looking in, are now the 
prime movers in developing the strategic foreign policy of the United States. 
They include such powerful Administration figures as Vice President Dick

Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul

Wolfowitz, Defense Advisory Board members Richard Perle and James Woolsey (a 
former CIA director), National Security Council's Mideast honcho Elliot 
Abrams, and a host of other highly-placed officials. 

<p>Their goals, as stated in their position papers and speeches, can be 
summarized thusly: Since the U.S. is the only superpower in the world, it 
should assert its power aggressively, in order to ensure that no other state 
or foreign organization (such as the U.N. or the E.U.) can ever rise to 
parity with the United States and challenge its pre-eminence. This aggressive 

posture includes the use of "pre-emptive" war --  i.e., if the U.S. thinks a 
country or force may want, at some future point, to take on America, the U.S. 
goes in guns-ablazing and convinces them otherwise. The PNAC doctrines are 
now official U.S. policy, as laid out in the National Security Strategy 
promulgated last year by the Bush Administration.

<p>Iraq, with a universally despised ruler, was selected as the demonstration 
model. The reasoning is similar to what Truman used in dropping atomic bombs 
on Japan, as a warning to the rest of the world to not even think about 
challenging America. As a result of what the U.S. did to and in Iraq, the 
rest of the Middle East has been informed in stark terms not to get too 
uppity or it could happen to you. Already, Syria has started backing away 
from its challenge to U.S. hegemony in the region. 

<p>The long-term result of achieving dominance in a region -- not necessarily by 
having to put troops on the ground -- is: 1) you now have effective control 
of the natural resources in that area; 2) you are able to reshape governments 
more to your liking, in this case more "democratic" governments in the 
autocratically-ruled Arab Middle East. 

<p>Q. But doesn't the U.S. risk that true democracic elections might bring into 
power fundamentalist Islamic rule antagonistic to U.S goals?

<p>A. Yes, of course. Especially because the U.S. doesn't really understand

Islam, Islamic nationalism, or proud Islamic history of battling "infidels." 
Case in point: Bush early on used the term "crusade" to describe what the 
U.S. was about in the Middle East, and was clueless as to why Muslims 
worldwide reacted in anger and horror. Sending in Christian missionaries to 
Iraq just fuels this fire of resentment.

<p>Rumsfeld says the U.S. won't let Islamists take control. But once you let the 
democracy genie out of the bottle, it's often impossible to deal with the 
implications on the ground. 

<p>The PNAC boys tend to see only how strong the U.S. is militarily, and believe 
that force always is capable of bending the will of citizens and nations. The 
PNACs are weaker in understanding the force of people power, of religious 
fervor, of nationalistic pride -- all of which may well came back to bite 
them where it really hurts.

<p>Q. But wouldn't democracy be good for all the downtrodden Arabs in the Middle 
East, who have been chafing for decades under authoritarian rule?

<p>A. Yes, of course -- unless they elect religious parties that will be just as 
strict and totalitarian as what they replace, maybe even worse. Then the

citizens of those countries will have gained very little, except to have the 
freedom to choose their own repressors, who are not easy to turn out at the 
polls once they get their Big Brother organizations running. Iran is a good 
example. 

<p>Q. So what can the U.S. do to try to prevent this scary state of affairs from 
ever happening?

<p>A. The one thing that will defuse the growing power of the fundamentalist 
Islamic movement is to quickly engineer a just resolution of the 
Israeli/Palestinian situation. If Palestine can obtain its own geographically 
and politically viable state -- and the only way to do that is for the U.S. 
to lean hard on the Israeli government to end the Occupation and withdraw 
from all settlements on Palestinian land -- the pus-filled boil would be

lanced in the Arab body politic. Two independent states would live side by 
side, with security guaranteed, no terrorist attacks by Palestinians inside 
Israel, no incursions by Israel into Palestine. 

<p>That's the one thing that the U.S. immediately could do, and needs to do, to 
change the explosive chemistry of the Middle East. Will it do it? History 
seems to point to a negative answer. The U.S., time after time, seems willing 
to back off and give in to Israel's extremist desires, which translate into 
further humilitation and frustration for the Palestinians. This time, the 
U.S. probably would have to threaten to withdraw all U.S. economic and 
miltiary aid to Israel in order to force it to end the Occupation and totally 
withdraw from all its settlements in Palestinian land -- but the Bush 
Administration has given no indication that it has that kind of foresight or 
courage.

The result, if no just and comprehensive settlement takes place, is that

Palestinian extremists will continue their terror campaign inside Israel, 
Israel will continue visiting its brutality upon the Palestinians, the Arab 
world will unite in its condemnation of the U.S. for not really wanting a 
just peace in the Middle East, and Islamic fundamentalists will assume more 
and more power in the area. We won't even mention the terrorism that would 
make its way to U.S. shores.

<p>Q. I'm gathering then that the U.S. will not make a military move on Syria or 
Iran, at least until after the Israel/Palestine "roadmap" is laid out and 
negotiations there begin. Am I right?

<p>A. Yes. As a result of the way the U.S. entered and destroyed Iraq -- with an 
illegal, immoral war, not caring what anybody else thought of its actions -- 
the unanimity against the U.S. in the Arab world, and the anti-U.S. economic 
boycotts being organized in Europe and elsewhere, are making even the PNAC 
boys have second thoughts about moving right now. First comes defusing the 
situation a bit, then later it'll be time to light the fuse of war-threats 
again. And then there's the upcoming 2004 campaign; none of the HardRighters 
want to do anything that would endanger Bush's chances. 

<p>Q. Do you see any chance that Bush could lose in 2004?

<p>A. Let's just say that it's still the economy, stupid, and Bush&Co. -- who 
took the largest surpluses in history and brought the country into huge 
deficits -- continue to shoot their own feet, pressing for even more enormous 
tax cuts (mostly for the wealthy and giant corporations) that will only do 
further damage to our tattered economy. Plus, so great is the resentment

against Bush among Democrats and many moderates that they may just unite in 
force behind a viable Democrat candidate this time. And, no, don't ask me 
who; we'll get to all that in another Dummies-type article.

<p>In the meantime, put pressure on your local elected officials to have voting 
machines that guarantee ways of checking that the balloting is on the 
up-and-up, and that exit polls are back in operation. If the computer voting 
machines' software has been tampered with and there's no paper trail, or

exit-polling, to measure votes cast against votes counted, all the good 
Democrat campaigning in the world will never gain a victory. You've been

forewarned.
