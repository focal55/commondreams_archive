<p>Have you seen all of that graphic media coverage of the 2000-plus wounded servicemen 
and -women who served in Iraq, laying in military hospitals with missing limbs? 
Me neither. I was made more aware of them last week by… Cher. You heard me right. 
And don’t you dare laugh: With the corporate media so hush-hush on the topic and 
the Bush administration trying to hide images of the dead and wounded, let’s be 
thankful there are still some divas with big mouths left. <p>A transcript made 
its way around the web last week of the glitzy entertainer’s call in to C-Span’s 
morning show Washington Journal. It was a call that would soon incur the wrath 
of the right-wing radio hit mob and a tacky gossip columnist or two. <p>"I would 
like to say I had the occasion the other day to slend the entire day with troops 
that had come back from Iraq and had been wounded, and I also visited troops during 
the Vietnam era," the unidentified caller from Miami Beach told the C-Span moderator 
Peter Slen, discussing her visit to the Walter Reed Army Hospital. <p>"But the 
thing that I was most shocked by as I walked into the hospital, the first person 
I ran into was a boy about 19 or 20 years old who’d lost both of his arms. And 
when I walked into the hospital and visited all these boys all day long, everyone 
had lost either one arm, one limb or two limbs or had lost one limb and there 
were, there were a lot of legs that seemed to be missing." <p>Slen: What were 
you doing at Walter Reed? Are you a volunteer? <p>Caller: No, I was just asked 
to come and slend the day. I was working that day in Washington, DC, and... <p>Slen: 
What kind of work do you do? <p>Caller: Um, I’m an entertainer. <p>Slen: Oh, what 
kind of entertaining? Are you USO? <p>Caller: No, I actually was called by the 
USO but I’m...I’m...I’m just...I’m an entertainer. And I really don’t want to 
go much past that but...um... <p>Slen: Is this Cher? <p>Caller: Yeah. <p>Cher 
then went on to ask a pertinent question regarding the men she visited in the 
hospital: "Why are none of Cheney, Wolfowitz, Bremer, the president, why aren’t 
they taking pictures with all these guys? Because I don’t understand why these 
guys are so hidden… Don’t hide them. Let’s have some news coverage where people 
are sitting and talking to these guys and seeing their spirit." <p>Photos of the 
wounded aren’t the only photos of soldiers we’re not seeing. As was reported by 
only a few media organizations in the past few weeks–buried on page A23 of the 
Washington Post–the Bush administration is not allowing the coffins of dead service 
people to be photographed either, putting up curtains at bases, keeping away the 
media that doesn’t seem all that interested anyway. <p>"Since the end of the Vietnam 
War, presidents have worried that their military actions would lose support once 
the public glimpsed the remains of US soldiers arriving at air bases in flag-draped 
coffins," wrote the Post’s White House reporter Dana Milbank. "To this problem, 
the Bush administration has found a simple solution: It has ended the public dissemination 
of such images by banning news coverage and photography of dead soldiers’ homecomings 
on all military bases." <p>Apparently, just before the fighting in Iraq began, 
the Pentagon sent out a directive: "There will be no arrival ceremonies for, or 
media coverage of, deceased military personnel returning to or departing from 
Ramstein [Germany] airbase or Dover [DE] base, to include interim stops." Since 
then, George W. Bush has posed in military drag himself, but hasn’t been to one 
memorial service or funeral for the more than 350 dead soldiers. <p>While we don’t 
see much coverage of the wounded and dead American soldiers, we’re still seeing 
lots of footage of pre-war Iraqi civilians suffering under Saddam Hussein. Last 
week CNN and Fox went big with a videotape it said American soldiers had uncovered 
last April, a tape it described as "a gruesome videotape found…by U.S. troops 
in Iraq." It depicted the "brutal punishment administered by the Fedayeen Saddam 
to enforce discipline under the regime of Saddam Hussein." <p>The tape, which 
CNN aired repeatedly, showed men being whipped, thrown off of buildings and having 
body parts amputated. A breathless Paula Zahn assured us that what they were showing 
was only the most tepid parts of the tape, which is much more grotesque in its 
totality. <p>Funny how the tape suddenly surfaced on news programs–having been 
seized by soldiers way back in April–just when George W. Bush’s numbers are falling 
and more people are losing faith in the American occupation of Iraq. Zahn insisted 
the tape was "not released by the Pentagon, but was obtained by CNN from independent 
sources." But there was Donald Rumsfeld openly talking about it, attesting to 
how "typical" the treatment on the tape was. <p>"There are a lot of [these kinds 
of tapes] around," Rumsfeld bellowed, "and they portray a regime that was about 
as vicious as any regime could conceivably be." <p>No one’s denying that Hussein 
was brutal, but with Iraqi civilians and American soldiers dying every day, you’d 
think there’d be a bit more sympathy for those killed last week, as opposed to 
last year. Even while discussing the killing of 16 U.S. service people last weekend–an 
event Rumsfeld termed "tragic" but "necessary" in a "war that’s difficult and 
complicated"–the defense secretary couldn’t help but talk about that suddenly 
surfaced tape chronicling past Saddam brutality. <p>At a press briefing, he’d 
said, "You learn something about a group of people and how they lived their lives 
and how they treated their people." <p>Right he is. So what does it say about 
a group of people and how they live their lives and treat their people when they 
send young men and women off to war and then won’t honor the dead among them and 
their families with so much as a photo-op? <p>And what does it say about the American 
media that it took a celebrity on down time during her "Farewell Tour" in Miami 
to call in to a public affairs show and point this out? Not in a million years 
would I have thought I’d ask this: Can we please replace Paula Zahn with Cher?
