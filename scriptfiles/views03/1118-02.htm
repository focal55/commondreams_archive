<p>Within the span of one week Democratic presidential candidates Howard Dean 
and Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) have decided to reject federal matching campaign funds 
during the presidential primaries. With President Bush already deciding to forgo 
the matching campaign funds, does the decisions of Dean and Kerry further undermine 
30 years of political contribution laws? When Dean kicked off his presidential 
bid, he committed to accepting taxpayer money and vowed to criticize any Democrat 
who didn't. Because of the reality of presidential campaigning in the 21st century, 
Dean now realizes that the Democratic nominee will face a severe cash disadvantage 
against Bush, who will abandon the system for the second time and raise upward 
of $200 million. <p>As of September 30, Dean and Kerry were the two leading fundraisers 
on the Democratic side, but their collective $45.5 million paled in comparison 
to President Bush, whose campaign had raised $85.2 million during the same period. 
<p>The Bush fundraising juggernaut leaves Dean and any other candidate who is 
serious about obtaining the Democratic nomination little choice. The president 
has no primary opponent and will be free to take aim at the eventual Democratic 
nominee until the GOP convention in early September. With a tough primary fight 
looming for the Democratic candidates, the matching funds restriction could leave 
the Democratic nominee unable to respond to the Bush attacks from March to until 
August, when the general election matching funds kick in. <p>Following in Dean's 
footsteps, Kerry has since decided that he too will opt out of the matching campaign 
funds during the primaries. Over the weekend, Kerry issued the following: "Today, 
I also issue a challenge to Governor Dean. Senator Russ Feingold has called on 
all Democratic candidates who forgo matching funds to pledge that they will not 
spend more than the limit of $45 million until the nomination is decided. I accept 
that -- and I call on Howard Dean to do the same. To show America that his decision 
was about beating George Bush and the special interests and not just about grabbing 
an advantage in the primaries." <p>The nobility of Kerry's challenge notwithstanding, 
an exegesis of his statement raises doubt about his ability raise $45 million, 
while appearing to maintain a feign commitment to the goals of the McCain-Feingold 
campaign finance reform legislation. <p>Though the Supreme Court is scheduled 
to rule early next year on its constitutionality, the McCain-Feingold legislation 
may already be obsolete. By eliminating soft money contributions, which benefited 
Democrats more than Republicans, and raising the hard money limits to $2000, McCain-Feingold 
effectively made it easier for the president to reach his goal of $200 million. 
Moreover, Republican and Democrats alike have already developed strategies to 
get soft money into the election. <p>Outside of the contributions from his personal 
resources, Kerry may find the bundling of $2,000 checks somewhat more difficult 
to obtain, placing Massachusetts's junior senator in a quandary. Though he boldly 
announced his plans to withdraw from the matching funds, Sen. Kerry is stuck somewhere 
between sounding "Dean Lite," with the fundraising methodology of "Bush Lite." 
<p>Unlike Bush and Kerry, Dean's decision to forgo matching funds, if successful, 
could actually move campaign finance reform beyond the moderate changes called 
for in McCain-Feingold. Dean has woven fundraising into the fabric of his campaign. 
Instead of fundraising being a necessary adjunct that opens the door to possible 
abuse, undo influences and time spent away from connecting with voters, Dean's 
utilization of the Internet has made fundraising a tool that involves the electorate. 
The byproduct could be increased voter turnout. <p>President Bush is packing out 
Westin Hotels across the country with $2,000 per plate luncheons for wealthy contributors 
to reach the $200 million plateau, and Sen. Kerry is hoping to do the same to 
reach $45 million. Dean is asking 2 million people to give him $100 each. At $77, 
Dean by far has the lowest contribution per individual rate among the major candidates. 
How much political influence might that buy in a Dean administration? One could 
expect to be named Ambassador to France for roughly 17 minutes. Byron Williams
