<p>I am 82 years old. My generation has been identified as the "greatest" generation by many, primarily because we have survived through many turbulent years. I do not agree.<p> We are not the greatest generation; we are the worst. We are the me-me-me generation.<p> <!-- END LEAD --> <!-- START REST --> Seniors have the most powerful lobbyists in the world that suck the blood out of our kids' hands while we sit around doing absolutely nothing about political disasters that surround us.<p> Why are the senior citizens standing mute while George W. Bush is promoting wars? Don't we know the consequence of war, the killing, the destruction of cities and infrastructures, and the creation of hate for Americans? If we win the wars, will we be safer?<p> What I am proposing is that the seniors of America use our almost unlimited power to end this drive to make war on any country that displeases us. America was a peace-loving country before Bush was elected. Why should we be the biggest threat to peace on the planet?<p> Have we forgotten the Vietnam War or the Korean War or the Bay of Pigs?<p> Why do we allow Rambo Bush to plunder our environment, ignore treaty obligations and ignore the problems of the inner cities when one bomber less would fund many programs for the poor?
