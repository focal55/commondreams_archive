<p>This week the American people were given a highly publicized free 
lesson in how they can become powerful against dominant corporate 
interests.  It was the swirling dynamics around the Do Not Call registry

established by the Federal Trade Commission which drew over 50,000,000 
people in a matter of weeks who don't like to be bothered by 
telemarketers while they're eating dinner.
<p>The events started on September 23rd when a federal district court 
judge, Lee R. West, ruled that the Federal Trade Commission did not have

the legal authority to set up such a system.  Members of Congress went, 
as they say, ballistic both as Republicans and Democrats.  Back in 
February, 98 percent of the Congress voted to fund such a registry that 
they thought was already authorized in previous legislation.  The 
reaction to Judge West's decision was bipartisan.  The message was that 
this decision will not stand.
<p>In little more than 24 hours, Congress overwhelmingly passed what 
Rep. Billy Tauzin called "This Time We Really Mean it Act."  The vote 
was 412 to 8 in the House and 95 to 0 in the Senate.  President Bush 
said he would sign it immediately.

<p>It is fascinating to watch legislators turn away from their usual 
corporate grips when they hear the growing thunder of the people.  Bill 
Tauzin, a certified cozy corporate carnivore in most instances, 
trumpeted "Fifty Million Americans can't be wrong."  He should have 
added "who spoke out," for he has been ignoring the subdued wishes of 
tens of millions of Americans on many other subjects that have come 
before his Subcommittee and his own vote.
<p>The powerful telemarketing industry whose campaign contributions 
and allies in Congress have made it a force to be reckoned with was also 
overwhelmed by the vote.  It is in a bind.  On the one hand, it doesn't 
want to appear too aggressive in taking away the right of the people to 
register "do not call,"; on the other hand it wants to over-turn the FTC

rule in court.  Hours after the Oklahoma decision was countered by 
Congress, a federal district court in Denver ruled that the Do not Call 
Registry violated the telemarketing companies' (who are not real 
persons, we should remember) constitutional right of free speech.
    Judge Edward Nottingham ruled that the FTC burdened the commercial 
speech of the telemarketing companies by not applying the Do Not Call 
rule to non-profit solicitation such as those of the Red Cross, 
colleges, or public television.  That burden he said was significant 
enough to violate the First Amendments speech right of these corporations.
<p>There are two problems with the Judge's reasoning.  First, the FTC 
has no jurisdiction over many non-profit group activities, so it could 
not adjust to his ruling even if it tried.  More important, the courts 
have distinguished, though less than before, between the constitutional 
protection of commercials speech and what the attorneys call political 
speech -- regular conversations.  In a word, commercial advertisements 
or marketing talk are given less protection from regulation, especially 
when consumers don't want their privacy invaded.
<p>The Supreme Court has already allowed consumers to block so-called 
junk-mail.  People can put a no-solicitation sign in front of their 
house.  Constitutional law specialists think the Direct Marketing 
Association -- one of the plaintiffs -- will not likely over-turn the 
FTC rule on appeal.
<p>Meanwhile, Congress is trying to figure out what to do when a court 
raise a constitutional issue -- usually reserved for the courts -- in 
time for the October 1st deadline for the Do Not Call Registry to go 
into effect.
<p>Feeling the public's heat, the Direct Marketing Association on 
September 26th advised its members to respect the national "do not call"

list despite the two court rulings in its favor.  Someone's getting 
smart.  Corporate free speech does not extend to unwilling buyers who 
have registered their desire to keep the calls from coming to their homes.
<p>All in all, the lesson is that should many Americans devote a tiny 
amount of time to convey their desires or displeasures, the thunder from

that large community is heard in Washington.  Civic morale in America 
should grow and give people a better feeling that when they act, they 
make the difference.
