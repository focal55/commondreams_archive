<p>As I edged forward in the line of cars heading out of the stores' parking lot, I had time to notice the ordinary: American flags on bumpers, on rear windows, even on a rearview mirror. Other flags drooped from small plastic flagpoles stuck out rear windows. A dog in a pickup wore a flag scarf. Bumper stickers declared ''God Bless America,'' ''I'm Proud to Be an American,'' ''United We Stand,'' and a simple ''9/11.''

<P>



   Beside me on the seat was the last purchase of drugs for 2002 and a copy of the year's total drug expenses: $9,400.21 for Minnie Mae, $11,021.79 for me - a total of $20,421. I am 78, Minnie Mae 83, and I wondered how many people of our age can afford more than $20,000 a year for medications.

<P>



   Of course we are among the fortunate. Minnie Mae gets reimbursed for 80 percent of her prescriptions so far. My coverage ran out Aug. 1, the second time that has happened, but we will each have an increase of $5,000 of coverage beginning this year.

<P>



   I joined the faculty of the University of New Hampshire in 1963, not because of an urge to teach but because as a freelance writer I could get medical insurance and a pension. My students taught me the joys and satisfactions of teaching, but if they hadn't, I would have stayed on for the health and retirement benefits.

<P>



   Our benefits are a private blessing, but as I read more patriotic slogans, pass windows plastered with American flags, see patriotic billboards selling cars, observe red, white, and blue bunting advertising a clothing sale or a restaurant opening, I grow angry for the silent many who have no health coverage and do not expect it. They cut their pills in half, skip every other day, or do not even go to the doctor.

<P>



   President Bush has health coverage. So do senators, representatives, Cabinet officers, governors, and mayors. The men and woman at the top of our drug companies and other corporations have medical coverage, although more and more workers and retirees find their coverage shrinking or disappearing.

<P>



   The corporate upper middle class still has medical coverage - so far. We have an economic aristocracy in this country. We are the ones who vote for the millionaires who inhabit our Congress and  state houses; we are the ones who support and influence those in power and  those who, by this administration, are rewarded with tax cuts.

<P>



   Those at the bottom of the economic pyramid have always been cynical about those who own and govern the country, but that cynicism is reaching upward, especially among the elderly. We fear we will lose our prescription coverage if we have it and know we cannot replace it. For all the campaign rhetoric, we know that those in power do not understand or care about our medical costs.

<P>



   I read another patriotic bumper sticker and imagine a true patriotism - not one of symbols and slogans, but of action in which those who have would feel an obligation to care for those who do not have, a democracy of caretaking where everyone counts, a capitalism in which profits are shared with those who provide the work on which our economic aristocracy depends.

<P>



   Perhaps we will see bumper stickers that read ''United We Share,'' ''America Means Caring,'' ''Good Health for All Is the American Way,'' ''Raise My Taxes and Provide for the Needy.''

<P>



   But I doubt it. We who have want more and those who don't? Well, tough luck.</i></P>
