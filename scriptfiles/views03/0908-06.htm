<p>A FEW WEEKS AGO, Arnold Schwarzenegger was clearly the candidate to 
beat on Oct. 7. With his Hollywood charm seducing the camera, he almost 
succeeded in acting like a serious candidate.
<P>Since then, he has demonstrated how unprepared he is to run for governor. 
Last week, for example, the Hollywood hulk proved too timid to join other 
candidates for the first debate in Walnut Creek.
<P>Odd, isn't it, that a former bodybuilder, a super-macho actor who 
vanquishes his enemies in action films, should be too scared to tell voters 
how he would govern the state of California?
<P>Aside from his cowardice, Schwarzenegger is a candidate who has little to 
offer as governor:
<P>-- He has no experience running anything but his own career as a 
bodybuilder and actor. He has neither run for -- nor held -- an elected office.
<P>What he knows about state administration, the Legislature or public policy 
could fit through the eye of a needle.
<P>-- A candidate who didn't vote in two presidential elections and skipped 5 
of 11 statewide races isn't serious about American democracy. Does he only 
vote when it fits into his schedule or if his name appears on the ballot?
<P>-- Until last week, Schwarzenegger's handlers wouldn't let him participate 
in any debate, unless he received the questions in advance. (So that he could 
rehearse his lines?) Apparently that seemed too scripted, so they have now 
relented, saying he didn't want to see the questions beforehand in the one 
debate he has agreed to join on Sept. 24. But what does this earlier decision 
say about their confidence in his ability to speak to the public about 
specific policy recommendations?
<P>-- Schwarzenegger may be able to buy a brain trust, but it doesn't appear 
to have helped him all that much. Unlike other candidates, he has offered no 
overarching plan -- or policy proposals -- for solving the state's daunting 
economic crisis. He has also dodged taking stands on affirmative action or 
Proposition 54, the racial privacy initiative.
<P>In short, Schwarzenegger is a pretty face, a clever man, and an expert on 
stagecraft, but he has no business running for the governor of this state.
<P>Instead of showering attention on his candidacy, concerned voters should 
pour their energy into registering every eligible voter. Last week, a man ran 
through BART cars with registration forms. I saw at least seven people take 
them, including the woman sitting next to me, who said she had moved and 
forgotten to renew her registration.
<P>At the same time, I want to remind Californians why they should vote "no" 
on the recall.
<P>Gov. Gray Davis, for all his faults, was guilty of no malfeasance, no high 
crimes or misdemeanors. True, there was plenty of voter grumbling about the 
budget crisis. But there was no evidence of a populist uprising against the 
governor -- until, that is, ultraconservative Republicans bought and paid for 
a recall, hoping they could hijack an election they lost when Davis beat Bill 
Simon last year.
<P>Like the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the presidential election of 2000, 
the recall is an attempt to repeal another Democratic electoral victory, which 
is a dangerous subversion of representative democracy.
<P>Schwarzenegger, of course, wasn't the candidate the ultraconservatives had 
in mind; he's way too liberal on social issues. But many desperate 
ultraconservatives, including Rush Limbaugh, have abandoned whatever 
principles they had and decided to support any Republican candidate they can 
get.
<P>What a pity, though, that their candidate doesn't have the courage of his 
most famous cinematic character. But Schwarzenegger is the first to remind us, 
especially when he defends the many murders he has committed on the silver 
screen, that there is a big difference between movies and reality.</p>
