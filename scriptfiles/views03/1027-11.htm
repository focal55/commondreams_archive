<p>Every time I limp through airport security these days, which isn't often, I think of my late departed friend, Perry. 

<p>Perry was a junkie. He preferred heroin, but he'd swallow or smoke just about anything he could get his hands on: cocaine, crack, booze, grass, hash, ecstasy, angel dust. You name it, Perry had tried it and would cheerfully try it again. 

<p>I saved Perry's life once, but there's no distinction in that. Just about everybody who knew him had saved him at least once. Perry had a tendency to overdo. 

<p>When Perry died a year ago, he should have made headlines around the world: "Junkie Survives to Age 74." But he got only the little death notice his relatives paid for. 

<p>For a guy like Perry to survive to 74 is like a normal person living to 110. 

<p>As you might expect, Perry had his little brushes with the law. He was a hardworking devil, but he couldn't always earn enough to support his vices of the moment, so he stole and got caught. He was in and out of prison, and spent most of his adult life there. 

<p>I can't remember when it was exactly -- perhaps the time I hired him to paint my apartment and came home to find paint everywhere except on the walls, beer cans strewed all about, and a bent spoon and a lot of burnt matches in the kitchen -- but Perry once gave me a pearl of wisdom I've never forgotten. 


<p>I was putting a padlock on something, and Perry said, with a touch of sarcasm, "That's a nice lock. That'll keep your friends out." 

<p>And that's why I always think of Perry whenever I limp through airport security. 

<p>Airport security is like that padlock, or the two-bit alarm I have in my car. It'll protect me from my friends. 

<p>Our so-called war on terrorism protects us from our friends. It would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. The Bush Doctrine, which long ago became evident, is simpleminded. It is to lock the back door of the barn after the cow strolls out the front, and it is to lock up or kill anyone who might possibly be a terrorist. 

<p>We the people of the mighty United States of America, beacon of hope and freedom, have unleashed a small army of international cops to imprison and murder at will. 

<p>The justification for our own evildoing was summed up recently by an FBI agent referring to the so-called Lackawanna Six. If you haven't followed the case, the "Six" are six Americans of Yemeni ancestry who got sucked into traveling to Afghanistan in mid-2001 (before Sept. 11) and took part in an al-Qaeda training camp. Now they're in prison, convicted of giving aid and comfort to an enemy of the United States. 

<p>President Bush has called these young Americans "a terrorist cell," which is about as realistic as Oral Roberts seeing a 900-foot-tall Jesus. The Lackawanna Six were not necessarily the Buffalo, N.Y., area's best citizens, but not a scintilla of evidence was produced to indicate they meant harm to their native land, the United States. 

<p>The FBI agent in charge of the Buffalo office, Ed Needham, summed up the case like this (quoted in The New York Times): "We were looking to prevent something, and we did. Obviously, nothing happened. So we all did our job." 

<p>That keen logic reminds me of the general in charge of putting Japanese Americans into prison camps during World War II. He said the lack of espionage attributed to Japanese Americans simply proved how cunning they were. 

<p>In any case, our government is running roughshod over the lives of people all over the world. Our mantra seems to be, "If in doubt, arrest -- or kill." 

<p>That policy is bound to show success in the short run, and just as certain to prove disastrous in the long. When you willy-nilly kill or imprison innocents, you automatically create more enemies. 

<p>That's why it was heartening last week to learn that someone in the Bush administration finally -- at long last -- has started to question the methods of our "war on terrorism." 

<p>Donald Rumsfeld, may he live long and happily, in a memo to his closest advisors, asked, "Is our current situation such that 'the harder we work, the behinder we get'?" 

<p>It certainly is, Mr. Rumsfeld. That's what we liberal nuts have been trying to tell you since before your boss started his little dustup with Iraq. 

<p>Although some will argue with the starting date, the terrorists' war against the United States started not on Sept. 11, 2001, but on April 18, 1983, when 50 people were killed in an explosion in the American Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. 

<p>That war was significantly escalated a few months later, on Oct. 19, when 241 U.S. servicemen were killed by a truck bomb in their Beirut barracks. 

<p>Our initial reaction to terrorism against us was pitiful. In 1983, Ronald Reagan was president. He's the man some believe brought the Soviet Union down with a single speech (and by spending America hopelessly into debt), but his reaction to the barracks bombing was pitiful. He said he took (wink, wink) "full responsibility" (wink, wink) for the tragedy, and then he ordered U.S. troops to invade Grenada, population 97,000. 

<p>That bit of dog wagging diverted our attention and helped the president "who made us feel good" save face, but it did nothing to deter terrorists. 

<p>For all practical purposes, neither the first George Bush nor Bill Clinton nor George W. Bush did anything to truly deter terrorists. After Sept. 11, the current Bush went ape, with the result that we've strewed bodies all over the planet and we can't build jails fast enough to keep up with the so-called detainees we're putting into cages. 

<p>As Donald Rumsfeld so rightly suggested, we're making enemies faster than we're destroying them. 

<p>Folks, there is no way we can stop all acts of terrorism. The world's biggest padlock isn't going to make us safe. We think we're doing well because there haven't been any attacks on the American mainland since 2001, but that's got more to do with the incompetence of the terrorists than the effectiveness of our policies. 

<p>We Americans like to think of foreign terrorists as incredibly patient devils who space out their attacks to achieve maximum effect, but it's far more likely they attack what they can, when they can. They're not patient. They're just not that good. 

<p>If that's so, and I believe it is, then we're deterring nothing. And there's no way we can protect every airplane, every ship, every power plant, every train, every semitrailer, every crop duster, every everything. 

<p>If there are people willing to die to get us, they'll get us. 

<p>So I applaud Donald Rumsfeld for questioning our current policies. We need to be making friends, not creating enemies. Because of our size and power, we need to act humble, not arrogant. We need to help those who need help, not harm those who have the misfortune to live in a land on our hit list. 

<p>If we spread enough peace around the world, we might get to live in peace ourselves. If we spread enough violence, you can bet we'll get violence in return.
