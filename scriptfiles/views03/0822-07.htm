<p>August is supposed to be a slow month in Washington, DC but two 
public reports released by two news conferences on August 12th seem to 
indicate it is the press that is slow.
<p>Eight thousand doctors called for national health insurance and 
outlined their detailed single payer plan in an article published by the

Journal of the American Medical Association. The signers included two 
former U.S. Surgeons General, the former editor of the New England 
Journal of Medicine, hundreds of medical school professors and deans and

many practicing physicians throughout the country.
<p>Dr. Marcia Angell of the Harvard Medical School said "In the current

economic climate, we can no longer afford to waste the vast resources we

do on the administrative costs, executive salaries and profiteering of 
the private insurance system."  A factual predicate for her statement 
was given by Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, also of Harvard, who stated that 
"we are already spending enough to provide every American with superb 
medical care - $5,775 per person this year.  That's 42% higher than in 

Switzerland, which has the world's second most expensive health care 
system, and 83% higher than in Canada."
<p>In essence an expanded and improved version of traditional medicare,

the proposal, they assert, would save at least $200 billion annually on 
paperwork and administration.  This sum alone would cover all the 
uninsured and upgrade coverage for those who are under-insured.
<p>These thousands of physicians are "taking a stand on the side of 
patients and repudiating the powerful insurance and drug lobbies that 
block wholesome reform," said Dr. Quentin Young, former head of the 
Departmentof Medicine at Chicago's Cook County Hospital.
<p>The physicians' plan would provide universal, comprehensive coverage

without increasing overall health spending and give patients their free 
choice of doctor and hospital (which today's HMOs prohibit).  Most 
hospitals and clinics would remain privately owned and operated.
<p>What is unique about this proposal by the Physicians for a National 
Health Program is not only its life-saving potential, its increase in 
efficiency and its restraint on greed and poor quality care.  It is also

its detailed explanation on how it is to be paid for, how savings will 
result and how a much more benign reallocation of where the money now 
goes to where it should go if patients' needs are first.  See 
www.pnhp.org for more details or call 312-782-6006.
<p>The other event was about the failure of cable de-regulation and its

skyrocketing cable bills (just another example of the miserable failures

of so many deregulation schemes and their broken promises).
<p>Remember the promises of the cable industry.  In the Fifties and 
Sixties, a small cable industry promised no advertisements and vibrant 
local programming in return for a modest monthly fee.  Then, it was 
composed of many small firms which were indeed locally rooted -- 
community cable, it was called.  Now three giant cable conglomerates 
control 56% of the entire national marketplace.  De-regulation was a 
set-up for a spate of mergers slouching toward wider monopolization.
<p>Guess what happened after the last full stage de-regulation in 1996 
-- voted by many liberal Democrats such as Cong. Ed Markey (D-MA) along 
with the Gingrich crowd?  Consumers were price-gouged more than 50%.  
This was after Congress and Clinton promised that de-regulation would 
bring competition and lower prices, according to Ed Mierzwinski of the 
U.S. Public Interest Research Group -- the prime sponsor of the new 
report.  (seewww.uspirg.org for more details).
<p>But according to Jay Halfon, who wrote the Report, the reach of the 
cable company giants is boundless.  They continue "to deny competitors 
access to critical programming, wireline competition is virtually 
non-existent, and the industry now dominates the broadband Internet 
market, giving it enormous and unregulated influence over America's 
digital future," he writes.  Andrew Jay Schwartzman, long-time president

of the Media Access Project was direct: "The Internet as we know it is 
in jeopardy.  If the cable television model is extended to the Internet,

the open and interactive system which characterizes the dial up Internet

will be lost."
<p>What does the Report propose?  Return regulation to the states and 
local governments and away from the pathetic Federal Communications 
Commission.  Require as a condition of franchise renewal that cable 
operators include billing inserts that invite consumers to join a local 
Cable Action Group that would operate a local Audience Channel, well 
funded and equipped by the cable company -- a modest quid-pro-quo for 
the franchise.
<p>Introduce a la carte programming to expand consumer choices rather 
than being force-fed the programming bundles the cable operators 
demand.  Empower state public utility commissions to regulate all cable 
rates and charges for video services until real competition emerges.
    Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital 
Democracy, summed up the crisis: Cable's threat to democracy and 
diversity on the Internet, our virtual town square, cannot be over-stated."

<p>Two fresh reports by prominent organizations and civic leaders about

important matters on a slow news day and the major media looked the 
other way.  It happens all the time in Washington, DC.
