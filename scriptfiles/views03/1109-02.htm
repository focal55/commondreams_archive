<p>The intelligence process is a bit like virginity," says Ray McGovern, who worked 
as a CIA analyst for 27 years. "Once you prostitute it, it's never the same. Your 
credibility never recovers. <p>"Watching what has happened with Iraq over the 
past several months has been like watching your daughter being raped." <p>Such 
is an indication of the extraordinary depth of feeling within the US intelligence 
community as the Bush administration's basis for the war in Iraq - the weapons 
of mass destruction, the dark hint of links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qa'ida 
- has been shown to have been built on air. <p>Mr McGovern worked near the very 
top of his profession, giving direct advice to Henry Kissinger during the Nixon 
era and preparing the President's daily security brief for Ronald Reagan. Now 
he is co-founder of a group of former CIA employees called Veteran Intelligence 
Professionals for Sanity, or Vips for short. <p>What the Bush White House has 
done, he believes, is far worse than the false premise that dragged the United 
States into the Vietnam War - a reported second attack on a US destroyer in the 
Gulf of Tonkin which later turned out not to have taken place. "The Gulf of Tonkin 
was a spur-of-the-moment thing, and Lyndon Johnson seized on that. That's very 
different from the very calculated, 18-month, orchestrated, incredibly cynical 
campaign of lies that we've seen to justify a war. This is an order of magnitude 
different. It's so blatant." <p>Mr McGovern accuses Mr Bush of an extraordinary 
act of chutzpah - taking advantage of his authority as President of the United 
States to make people believe there must be something to his insistent allegations 
that Iraq possessed potentially devastating weaponry. <p>"Many of us felt there 
had to be something there ... If this had been another country, one would have 
written a convincing analysis that this guy is lying through his teeth, that there 
are no weapons in Iraq. But people thought, the President can't say he knows something 
if he doesn't. That was persuasive, in a way. <p>"Now we know that no other President 
of the United States has ever lied so baldly and so often and so demonstrably 
... The presumption now has to be that he's lying any time that he's saying anything." 
<p>It will, Mr McGovern believes, take a change of president and a change of CIA 
director to even begin to repair the damage done by what he sees as an overt politicisation 
of the intelligence business. But even that may not be enough. <p>"Unless what 
has happened in the past year and a half is recognised as a scandal, in which 
the CIA has been badly abused, then there's no hope," he said. "I pin my hopes 
mostly on the press these days. Turns out, surprise surprise, that even the US 
press doesn't like to be lied to." <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; 2003 Independent Digital
