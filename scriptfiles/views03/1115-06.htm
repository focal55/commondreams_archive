<p>Dear American serviceperson in Iraq,</P>

      <P>I am a retired veteran of the army, and
      my own son is among you, a paratrooper like I was. The changes
      that are happening to every one of you--some more extreme than
      others--are changes I know very well. So I'm going to say some
things to you straight up in the language to which you are accustomed.</P>

      <P>In 1970, I was assigned to the 173rd
      Airborne Brigade, then based in northern Binh Dinh Province in
      what was then the Republic of Vietnam. When I went there, I had
      my head full of shit: shit from the news media, shit from movies,
      shit about what it supposedly mean to be a man, and shit from
      a lot of my know-nothing neighbors who would tell you plenty
      about Vietnam even though they'd never been there, or to war
      at all.</P>
<P>The essence of all this shit was that
      we had to &quot;stay the course in Vietnam,&quot; and that we
      were on some mission to save good Vietnamese from bad Vietnamese,
      and to keep the bad Vietnamese from hitting beachheads outside
      of Oakland. We stayed the course until 58,000 Americans were
      dead and lots more maimed for life, and 3,000,000 Southeast
      Asians were dead. Ex-military people and even many on active
duty played a big part in finally bringing that crime to a halt.</P>
<P>When I started hearing about weapons
      of mass destruction that threatened the United States from Iraq,
      a shattered country that had endured almost a decade of trench
      war followed by an invasion and twelve years of sanctions, my
      first question was how in the hell can anyone believe that this
      suffering country presents a threat to the United States? But
      then I remembered how many people had believed Vietnam threatened
the United States. Including me.</P>

      <P>When that bullshit story about weapons
      came apart like a two-dollar shirt, the politicians who cooked
      up this war told everyone, including you, that you would be greeted
      like great liberators. They told us that we were in Vietnam to
make sure everyone there could vote.</P>

      <P>What they didn't tell me was that before
      I got there in 1970, the American armed forces had been burning
      villages, killing livestock, poisoning farmlands and forests,
      killing civilians for sport, bombing whole villages, and commiting
      rapes and massacres, and the people who were grieving and raging
      over that weren't in a position to figure out the difference
      between me--just in country--and the people who had done those
things to them.</P>

      <P>What they didn't tell you is that over
      a million and a half Iraqis died between 1991 and 2003 from malnutrition,
      medical neglect, and bad sanitation. Over half a million of those
      who died were the weakest: the children, especially very young
children.</P>

      <P>My son who is over there now has a baby.
      We visit with our grandson every chance we get. He is eleven
      months old now. Lots of you have children, so you know how easy
      it is to really love them, and love them so hard you just know
      your entire world would collapse if anything happened to them.
      Iraqis feel that way about their babies, too. And they are not
      going to forget that the United States government was largely
responsible for the deaths of half a million kids.</P>

      <P>So the lie that you would be welcomed
      as liberators was just that. A lie. A lie for people in the United
      States to get them to open their purse for this obscenity, and
a lie for you to pump you up for a fight.</P>

      <P>And when you put this into perspective,
      you know that if you were an Iraqi, you probably wouldn't be
      crazy about American soldiers taking over your towns and cities
      either. This is the tough reality I faced in Vietnam. I knew
      while I was there that if I were Vietnamese, I would have been
one of the Vietcong.</P>

      <P>But there we were, ordered into someone
      else's country, playing the role of occupier when we didn't know
      the people, their language, or their culture, with our head full
      of bullshit our so-called leaders had told us during training
      and in preparation for deployment, and even when we got there.
      There we were, facing people we were ordered to dominate, but
      any one of whom might be pumping mortars at us or firing AKs
      at us later that night. The question we stated to ask is who
      put us in this position?</P>

      <P>In our process of fighting to stay alive,
      and in their process of trying to expel an invader that violated
      their dignity, destroyed their property, and killed their innocents,
      we were faced off against each other by people who made these
      decisions in $5,000 suits, who laughed and slapped each other
      on the back in Washington DC with their fat fucking asses stuffed
      full of cordon blue and caviar.</P>

      <P>They chumped us. Anyone can be chumped.</P>

      <P>That's you now. Just fewer trees and
      less water.</P>

      <P>We haven't figured out how to stop the
      pasty-faced, oil-hungry backslappers in DC yet, and it looks
      like you all might be stuck there for a little longer. So I want

      to tell you the rest of the story.</P>

      <P>I changed over there in Vietnam and they
      were not nice changes either. I started getting pulled into something--something
      that craved other peole's pain. Just to make sure I wasn't regarded
      as a &quot;fucking missionary&quot; or a possible rat, I learned
      how to fit myself into that group that was untouchable, people
      too crazy to fuck with, people who desired the rush of omnipotence
      that comes with setting someone's house on fire just
      for the pure hell of it, or who could kill anyone, man, woman,
      or child, with hardly a second thought. People who had the power
      of life and death--because they could.</P>

      <P>The anger helps. It's easy to hate everyone
      you can't trust because of your circumstances, and to rage about
      what you've seen, what has happened to you, and what you have
      done and can't take back.</P>

      <P>It was all an act for me, a cover-up
      for deeper fears I couldn't name, and the reason I know that
      is that we had to dehumanize our victims before we did the things
      we did. We knew deep down that what we were doing was wrong.
      So they became dinks or gooks, just like Iraqis are now being
      transformed into ragheads or hajjis. People had to be reduced
      to &quot;niggers&quot; here before they could be lynched. No
      difference. We convinced ourselves we had to kill them to survive,
      even when that wasn't true, but something inside us told us that
      so long as they were human beings, with the same intrinsic value
      we had as human beings, we were not allowed to burn their homes
      and barns, kill their animals, and sometimes even kill them.
      So we used these words, these new names, to reduce them, to strip
      them of their essential humanity, and then we could do things
      like adjust artillery fire onto the cries of a baby.</P>

      <P>Until that baby was silenced, though,
      and here's the important thing to understand, that baby never
      surrendered her humanity. I did. We did. That's the thing you
      might not get until it's too late. When you take away the humantiy
      of another, you kill your own humanity. You attack your own soul
      because it is standing in the way.</P>

      <P>So we finish our tour, and go back to
      our families, who can see that even though we function, we are
      empty and incapable of truly connecting to people any more, and
      maybe we can go for months or even years before we fill that
      void where we surrendered our humanity, with chemical anesthetics--drugs,
      alcohol, until we realize that the void can never be filled and
      we shoot ourselves, or head off into the street where we can
      disappear with the flotsam of society, or we hurt others, esepcially
      those who try to love us, and end up as another incarceration
      statistic or a mental patient.</P>

      <P>You can ever escape that you became a
      racist because you made the excuse that you needed that to survive,
      that you took things away from people that you can never give
      back, or that you killed a piece of yourself that you may never
      get back.</P>

      <P>Some of us do. We get lucky and someone
      gives a damn enough to emotionally resuscitate us and bring us
      back to life. Many do not.</P>

      <P>I live with the rage every day of my
      life, even when no one else sees it. You might hear it in my
      words. I hate being chumped.</P>

      <P>So here is my message to you. You will
      do what you have to do to survive, however you define survival,
      while we do what we have to do to stop this thing. But don't
      surrender your humanity. Not to fit in. Not to prove yourself.
      Not for an adrenaline rush. Not to lash out when you are angry
      and frustrated. Not for some ticket-punching fucking military
      careerist to make his bones on. Especially not for the Bush-Cheney
      Gas &amp; Oil Consortium.</P>

      <P>The big bosses are trying to gain control
      of the world's energy supplies to twist the arms of future economic
      competitors. That's what's going on, and you need to understand
      it, then do what you need to do to hold on to your humanity.
      The system does that; tells you you are some kind of hero action
      figures, but uses you as gunmen. They chump you.</P>

      <P>Your so-called civilian leadership sees
      you as an expendable commodity. They don't care about your nightmares,
      about the DU that you are breathing, about the lonliness, the
      doubts, the pain, or about how you humanity is stripped away
      a piece at a time. They will cut your benefits, deny your illnesses,
      and hide your wounded and dead from the public. They already
      are.</P>

      <P>They don't care. So you have to. And
      to preserve your own humanity, you must recognize the humanity
      of the people whose nation you now occupy and know that both
      you and they are victims of the filthy rich bastards who are
      calling the shots.</P>

      <P>They are your enemies--The Suits--and
      they are the enemies of peace, and the enemies of your families,
      especially if they are Black families, or immigrant families,
      or poor families. They are thieves and bullies who take and never
      give, and they say they will &quot;never run&quot; in Iraq, but
      you and I know that they will never have to run, because they
      fucking aren't there. You are</P>

      <P>They'll skin and grin while they are
      getting what they want from you, and throw you away like a used
      condom when they are done. Ask the vets who are having their
      benefits slashed out from under them now. Bushfeld and their
      cronies are parasites, and they are the sole beneficiaries of
      the chaos you are learning to live in. They get the money. You
      get the prosthetic devices, the nightmares, and the mysterious
      illnesses.</P>

      <P>So if your rage needs a target, there
      they are, responsible for your being there, and responsible for
      keeping you there. I can't tell you to disobey. That would probably
      run me afoul of the law. That will be a decision you will have
      to take when and if the circumstances and your own conscience
      dictate. But it perfeclty legal for you to refuse illegal orders,
      and orders to abuse or attack civilians are illegal. Ordering
      you to keep silent about these crimes is also illegal.</P>

      <P>I can tell you, without fear of legal
      consequence, that you are never under any obligation to hate
      Iraqis, you are never under any obligation to give yourself over
      to racism and nihilism and the thirst to kill for the sake of
      killing, and you are never under any obligation to let them drive
      out the last vestiges of your capacity to see and tell the truth
      to yourself and to the world. You do not owe them your souls.</P>

      <P>Come home safe, and come home sane. The
      people who love you and who have loved you all your lives are
      waiting here, and we want you to come back and be able to look
      us in the face. Don't leave your souls in the dust there like
      another corpse.</P>

      <P>Hold on to your humanity.</P>
