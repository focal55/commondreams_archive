<p>WITH ALL the Bush administration has on its plate -- the aftermath in Iraq, Israeli-Palestinian discord, homeland security, economic woes -- one might think it has no time to pick on doctors who prescribe medical marijuana. 



<p>Yet the administration continues to escalate its war on medical marijuana -- 



and Proposition 215 in particular -- by intimidating physicians who are doing what they think is best for their patients. 



<p>The White House has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow federal authorities to punish California doctors who merely recommend marijuana. 



<p>President Bush wants the authority to revoke doctors' licenses to prescribe drugs if they tell patients that pot might be helpful. A ruling in the White House's favor would overturn the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco that said penalizing doctors for just consulting with patients violates free-speech guarantees. 



<p>But Bush's motive may be to uproot Proposition 215. Ever since voters approved the law in 1996, raids by federal drug agents have disrupted the state's medical marijuana operations. 



<p>Marijuana does appear to offer a benefit for some medical conditions. Of course, the clinical proof of such benefits remains elusive, especially since the federal government has resisted funding definitive clinical studies. 



<p>"What we're asserting here is the basic, fundamental right of local government . . . to control the health and safety of its citizens," is how Santa Clara University law professor Gerald Uelmen put it. 



<p>The Supreme Court should dismiss the appeal, and Bush should attend to far more pressing matters.
