<p>Earlier this summer, I was in Stanwood, Wash., hanging out with a loosely affiliated group called the "<a href="http://www.futurenet.org/index.htm" target="_new">Positive Futures Network</a>."
<p>I met Raffi, who since 1976, has been praised by parents and kids the world over for his children's songs and performances. But even if you've never heard of him, but like reading autobiographies, you'll enjoy reading, "Raffi: The Life of a Children's Troubadour (1999, Homeland Press)."

<p>His music is a true expression of his sunny personality, which centers around cherishing the dignity of children. It wasn't long before Raffi and I got to talking about kids - my own two daughters in particular.

<p>What the world needs now, he said, is a "child-honoring society," which shouldn't be confused with a "child-obsessed society."

<p>In the conclusion of his book he writes: "I sometimes wonder what the world will offer my young friends when they are my age." Then he makes an important observation. "The unprecedented concentrations of corporate capital constitute a global power, a concern that should not be left to economists alone."


<p>Why? Because "today's business activity affects every family's health - for better or worse - as never before." For example, increasing amounts of toxic chemicals and diminishing biodiversity, which cause more damage than terrorism.

<p>So I ask myself, can I identify one of these "global power" centers as it relates to kids? Reflecting on Raffi led me to research Madison Avenue - the symbolic Mecca of the advertising industry, where the American "dream" is packaged for sale. I found that, in eyes of ad execs, children are viewed as a trifecta of profitability - as buyers, as influences of their parents spending and as future adult consumers.

<p>And because of that, ad execs aggressively clamor for the attention of children. With access to $15 billion to spend on toys, clothes, candy and snacks, studies estimate that children influence another $160 billion in parental purchases.

<p>You should check out some of the literature on this stuff. AdRelevance, for example, in a report called "The ABC's of Advertising to Kids Online," says this: "What do you call a consumer who wants to buy everything you have, doesn't care what it costs and is less than five feet tall? A marketer's dream? Nope. You call them kids...Why create ads for kids? They possess a currency more powerful than cash: influence."

<p>Though the federal government regulates advertising, AdRelevance gleefully reports: "An investigation of 78 family focused companies...showed advertising growth in the wake of the FTC guidelines."

<p>Then, there's this highly acclaimed book called "Creating Ever-Cool: A Marketer's Guide to a Kid's Heart," by Gene Del Vecchio. One section - "The Child Psyche" - examines "the timeless and underlying needs of childhood."

<p>One reviewer says of the book's big idea: "I found the concept that there could be a Kid Psyche Gap in the market place to be especially intriguing....Psyche Gaps are 'that part of the child's psyche that is not currently being satisfied by a competitor'."

<p>Ad man Buzz Potamkin describes the challenge of kid advertising: "Everyone tells you it's easy, and then you try it....And then you begin to understand just how hard it is to take candy from a baby."

<p>As if the hundreds of thousands of ads that kids are bombarded with each year isn't enough, they've got things like Channel One, which is a 12-min-ute "news" program aired in hundreds of thousands of classrooms across the country with commercials popped in. Cash-strapped schools will do almost anything to get money, including offering up a captive, impressionable audience for Madison Avenue.

<p>So while the right-wing radio show hosts and conservative "scholars" like William Bennett lament teachers who are allegedly more concerned with students' self-esteem than with the three R's, I'd be more worried about ad execs who see your kids as "psyche gap" sufferers in need of ads to heal them and keep them as "a consumer who wants to buy everything you have, and doesn't care what it costs."
