<p>IMAGINE YOU live in Richmond. You hear a loud explosion, rush to the window and see a huge plume of black smoke rising in the sky. A siren starts wailing, warning surrounding communities of an oil refinery explosion. Should you stay inside or evacuate? 

<p>If everything goes right, an automated phone call tells you whether you should leave home or stay. If the phone doesn't ring, you turn on the radio or television and public health officials explain that the air does not pose a health hazard. You sigh with relief, and follow instructions to stay indoors with the windows shut. 

<p>Now imagine that two years have passed and you discover that these same officials actually lied. They knew the air was contaminated but didn't even inform those with asthma and respiratory diseases to take special precautions. 

<p>Imagine your sense of betrayal. That's what millions of people in lower New York are feeling right now. 

<p>In the days after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the White House instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to tell New Yorkers that the air was safe, even though they did not have sufficient and reliable data from air and water samples. 


<p>Many New Yorkers, of course, never believed the EPA in the first place. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and public health at New York University, who saw the explosions from the roof of her Washington Square apartment, told me that "This comes as no surprise to anyone who lived through the aftermath of 9/11. We could hardly breathe and the smell was appalling. I have photographs of people walking around here with scarves covering their faces to keep out the smoke and smells." 

<p>According to a report issued by the office of the EPA inspector general, the agency changed the original draft, issued reassuring statements, deleted cautionary warnings and suppressed information about the danger of indoor pollution. Instead of telling the truth, EPA officials failed to tell people suffering from asthma and respiratory diseases that they were especially vulnerable to the dust and contaminants in the air that settled on the ground, carpets and furniture. They also neglected to inform the public that asbestos had reached a level that was harmful to ordinary people. 

<p>This is not how the EPA or public health officials should act in a crisis. We depend on their credibility. They are supposed to take samples of air and water, assess the level of danger to the public's health, tell us what they know, acknowledge what they don't yet know and give us their best professional advice on how to avoid risks to our health. 

<p>So why did the EPA lie? The generous interpretation is that the Bush administration wanted to reassure a traumatized public. Perhaps federal officials wanted to limit the level of public panic and act as if they were in control. Maybe they wanted to keep Wall Street running as smoothly as possible. 

<p>Or, as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has suggested, perhaps they wanted to downplay the health risks so that they could limit the amount of federal aid given to New Yorkers. 

<p>Whatever the reason, deception is hardly novel in the Bush administration. These are leaders who have misled the public about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the costs of the war and the postwar stability of that country. 

<p>As a result, this administration has developed a growing credibility gap. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has rightly warned that "If the public loses faith that things are safe when the government says so, we'll have done more damage than a pointed statement the week after 9/11 would have." 

<p>He's right. Credibility is crucial to maintaining the legitimacy of a government. If we can't trust the federal government with our health, perhaps we should consider regime change.
