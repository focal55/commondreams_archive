<p>Our governor-elect and the Legislature are about to embark on another cycle 
of budget discussions. In normal budget times, it is a moral obligation for lawmakers 
to spend taxpayers' funds wisely. During the worst budget crisis in California's 
history, it is imperative. Every dollar spent should be used strategically, effectively 
and toward meeting our obligation to protect our most vulnerable citizens and 
to educate the next generation. <p>That is what makes recent revelations about 
Wal-Mart, one of the world's wealthiest corporations and the largest private employer 
in America, so disturbing. Wal-Mart is one of many large corporations that skimp 
on health care for their employees. Inadequate health insurance coverage, high 
deductibles and cost-sharing that is out of reach for low-wage workers add to 
the corporate bottom-line. Wal-Mart also reportedly carefully controls the number 
of workers who achieve full-time status and higher benefit levels. <p>In the marketplace, 
where one of these giants is competing against a small business that is responsible 
to its workers and to the community, the giant will win every time. <p>Who picks 
up the tab for this lack of responsibility? We all do. Wal-Mart provides its workers 
with access to a Web-based service that allows a county social services worker 
to immediately verify income and employment. Such access can help to qualify workers 
quickly for Medi-Cal benefits, food stamps and other taxpayer-funded aid. <p>While 
the use of this fast-tracked system may help deliver government services to those 
who qualify for them; it can also raises a number of concerns: In an environment 
of low wages and meager benefits, it can be seen as encouraging big business to 
make taxpayer-funded services a part of their business plan. <p>The use of this 
system obscures information consumers need to make informed decisions. When consumers 
buy back-to-school clothes at Wal-Mart they should know whether they are encouraging 
a business practice that relies on siphoning taxpayer dollars out of education 
and other state needs. <p>Lawmakers must also consider whether it is appropriate 
for large, wealthy corporations to become welfare-dependent and should close any 
loopholes that lead to inappropriate use of scarce human service resources. Nothing 
should encourage corporations to "game the system'' or to claim unfair advantages. 
<p>It is helpful here to contrast our expectations of individuals with those we 
have for major corporations. When an individual uses Medi-Cal benefits, they may 
become subject to California's Medi-Cal Estate Recovery Program. Under this program, 
the state places liens against the assets of elderly, low- income Californians 
to recoup the costs for Medi-Cal coverage. Advocates have cited the example of 
the state of placing a lien on an aging mobile home. <p>If we expect the lowest-income 
Californians to reimburse the state when they receive benefits, then it makes 
sense to hold large, wealthy corporations similarly accountable. Despite turbulent 
economic conditions this year, Wal- Mart reported record profits and sales. Wal-Mart's 
earnings were more than $2. 5 billion, on total sales of $71 billion in the first 
quarter and more than $2.3 billion on total sales of $62 billion in the second 
quarter. <p>Our budget difficulties force to think about what kind of accountability 
we expect from each other -- and to begin to define good corporate citizenship 
in terms of what it is, rather than simply what it is not -- as honest partnerships, 
not just the absence of wrong-doing. Those we serve should expect nothing less.
