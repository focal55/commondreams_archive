<p>It’s the Islamic world that celebrates the just-initiated holy month of Ramadan 
— but it’s George W. Bush who better start praying. Maybe we all should. <p>The 
conservative spin machine and its White House engineers can whine and sputter 
all they want about the supposed lack of good news from Iraq to be found in the 
media, but the simple fact is that there just isn’t any to be reported. <p>Consider 
the toll of the past two weeks: 15 Americans killed in one missile attack, an 
average of 25 attacks a day against U.S. troops, a tightly coordinated string 
of car bombings, the shelling of the Al Rashid Hotel housing none other than Paul 
Wolfowitz, an assault that basically chased the Red Cross out of Iraq, escalated 
targeting of the newly trained police force and a rumor campaign that forced the 
shutdown of Baghdad’s public schools. The casualty toll reached more than four 
dozen dead and 200 wounded. <p>Bush responds that the wholesale spilling of blood 
should be read as none other than a sign of our “success,” that the murder campaign 
in Iraq is but a sign of desperation. Sure. We’ve heard this kind of reasoning 
before. War Is Peace, Hate Is Love, Slavery Is Freedom. And that old standard: 
Arbeit Macht Frei. <p>This official sense of denial is the scariest part of the 
whole Iraqi debacle. At least Richard Nixon came into office recognizing that 
somehow or other, the U.S. had to figure a way out of Vietnam. As wars go, Iraq’s 
still pretty small potatoes. But the unreality and rank politicization of the 
Bush policy, its drift and deception, and its mounting human and economic cost 
spell only continuing disaster. <p>Not that Congress, or the Democrats for that 
matter, plan to get in Bush’s way. The staggering $87 billion supplemental plan 
(read partial cost) passed along by the White House for the splendid little adventure 
was formally approved this past week without so much as a debate, let alone any 
sort of meaningful protest. Even some centrist Democrats, like syndicated columnist 
Matt Miller, were outraged at the obsequious rollover by their own party. <p>Here 
was a golden opportunity for some brave Democrat to revitalize the entire national 
debate, Miller wrote last week, by staging a filibuster. Not to deny the payment 
but to hold it hostage to a reversal of the Bush tax cuts. <p>Such a move would 
have owed nothing to revenge but all to social justice. What kind of fairyland 
is this nation living in when — with record deficits — we continue to rebate taxes 
to the superwealthy while running up a tab of tens of billions in Iraq? Now we 
know what Bush meant by “leave no child behind.” As a result of this shameful 
refusal to properly fund his own war making, the president (and Congress) — by 
my calculations — has dropped about a $1,500-per-head bill on each and every teenager 
in America. This is an infinitely more important economic statistic than the much-ballyhooed 
7 percent growth figure reported for this past quarter. Instead of the Democrats 
blowing up the fiction of the Bush economic program — guns, no butter, and tax 
cuts for the rich — they have left the door wide-open for a GOP propaganda blitz. 
<p>On second thought, hoping the Democrats would provide real opposition is much 
like thinking that my aunt could be my uncle — in either case they’d have to grow 
a set of balls. <p>That leaves only the option of a citizens’ movement. Back in 
the spring, before the invasion of Iraq, the peace movement was ahead of the curve, 
staking out a politically unpopular position. Now, I’m afraid it has fallen behind. 
Majority public opinion is now opposed to the war — at least in the inexplicable 
and unilateral way the Bush administration is carrying out the occupation. But 
the American public is too smart to believe the solution resides in the simplistic 
slogan of immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops. <p>Americans, unlike their 
government, would be more than ready to share the burden, costs and responsibilities 
of occupation with the rest of the world community. And that, indeed, is the only 
sensible way out of the morass. Simply packing up and leaving 26 million Iraqis 
at the mercy of those who now target the Red Cross, the U.N. and the incipient 
Iraqi authorities would be one more crime against humanity. Those setting off 
car bombs in downtown Baghdad are not some sort of romantic resistance, but rather 
are carrying out the bloody and criminal traditions of the deposed Saddam Hussein 
dictatorship. <p>The Bush administration had a shot at internationalizing the 
occupation last month when it won a unanimous rubber-stamping of yet another U.N. 
resolution. But as a friend remarked at the time, that “victory” was like a bald 
man winning a free haircut. The White House’s refusal to cede any of its total 
control over Iraq guaranteed that no significant amount of foreign troops or foreign 
funding for reconstruction will be forthcoming. <p>Instead, our children and our 
grandchildren will be paying for the war in Iraq, long after George W. Bush will 
have quietly and unremarkably passed into history. Iraq may, indeed, lead to the 
undoing of this administration. Let’s hope the country doesn’t go down with the 
presidency. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 2003 LA Weekly<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
