<p>It's school board week.
<p>Monday, I work with teachers on a new contract.
<p>Tuesday, I sit with the board to vote on a  budget.
<p>Since we did this last year, the five little communities that constitute our district have taken hits.  Our tax base nose dived when several of the few remaining local manufacturers closed.  Mills in surrounding towns also pulled the plug, sending more family wage earners into "retraining" for non-existent jobs.  The impact is noticeable in the school personnel office:  we're just about the only ones left providing health insurance, and families are scrambling aboard.
<p>So, we're looking at program cuts, deferred maintenance, and layoffs. This is not business as usual....even for a depressed area where cycles of poverty have driven neighbors' sons and fathers into the military for decades, the only ticket to a job, an education, or self-respect.  Town meeting last week started with prayers for family in Iraq, and there are many.
<p>At a round-table of local leaders convened to launch the economic lifeboats, I could not contain myself.  It's time to take this fight to Washington, I said.  Our school budget is rained on Iraq at the rate of a month a minute, all to blow apart the bodies and minds of 14 million children born there instead of here.  Congress, straight-faced, pontificates over a $650 billion tax cut...on our backs.  The "Education  President" sends mandates that will shut down, not improve, our schools.  Meanwhile, one federal expense after another is turned back to state and local governments to free the national budget for increased military spending.
<p>There is an embarrassed second of silence, and then the leaders move on, sorry for my liberal outburst.
<p>They had another meeting after that.  I didn't go.
<p>But I have to go Monday and Tuesday nights, and I'm mad as hell.
<p>I'm mad that these otherwise reasonable, personable people I work with, pass every day in the market, won't connect local pain with national incompetence.
<p>I'm disappointed that my friend, a store owner, who kindly invites snot-nosed urchins from kindergarten into his store for a field trip, can only spout "nuke-em" when speaking about Iraq.  He stands to lose a son there.
<p>I fear for the future when I look skyward and see military jets in formation playing in this western Maine flight training area....and
think of lives that will be lost under their cluster bomblets.   I
shudder at the billions tossed into ever-niftier hardware, the millions squandered to train each pilot-reminiscent of that young man 30 years ago in the Texas National Guard.  Only that one went AWOL:  a waste of an airman who went on to become a waste of a president.
<p>I'm appalled that another creep, so disliked and distrusted in his own state that he lost an election to a dead man, and then so alienated from his own cronies that he nearly failed confirmation, now has the gall to suggest dissent is unpatriotic.
<p>I grit my teeth and bear the color guards and pledges that open every civic function now, but I can't stand the fact that I and tens of thousands of local "officials" scramble in vain to pick up after this corrupt, brainless administration.
<p>This is school board week, and the nine of us will stand up and take shots for Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, Ridge, and Ashcroft.  So far, I'm the only one who's sputtering.  The rest are just plain sad and scared.
