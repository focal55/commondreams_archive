<p>On Feb. 27, 1968, Walter Cronkite, the CBS News anchorman, told the nation that America could not prevail in Vietnam, that the wise course of action was to admit we "did the best we could" and to begin a process of negotiation and withdrawal.

<p>Americans understood and trusted Cronkite, and the Vietnam War's fate was sealed. The 1968 presidential candidates backed an end to the war. Elected, Richard Nixon could have declared victory and come home. Instead, he stretched war on four more bloody years, using every tool to stifle truth and dissent, ending with an accord he could have had at the beginning of his term.

<p>As the occupation of Iraq goes bad, the Bush administration also seeks to stifle dissent. Debate on Iraq, warns Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, "sends a very unsettling message to Iraqis that our elections might decide their future. When they hear the message that we might not be there next year, they get very scared."

<p>However much beleaguered governments dislike it, wars, especially bad wars, are good subjects for debate. Regimes seeking to stifle debate with crude appeals to macho patriotism ("America will never run") serve themselves, not the nation. They know public opinion on war can bring down governments, as it did with Vietnam, and could well do with Iraq.

<p>In "Inventing Iraq," British scholar Toby Dodge writes that, having occupied Iraq since 1920, Britain's government, "had failed by 1927 to alter the long-running hostility of British public opinion." The occupation, wrote Lord Robert Cecil, "may be fatal to our existence at the next election." 

<p>So it was. The Conservatives were defeated in May 1929.

<p>The Bush administration, showing signs of desperation, still has no end game. Bush, who has lied to the nation from the beginning about this war, still talks as though American forces will not leave Iraq until legions of saluting Iraqi democrats shouting aves are ready to line up to acclaim them. 

<p>As the rising daily body count demonstrates, the chances of that are zero.


<p>Bush needs an exit strategy. Here it is:

<p>First: Admit we need help. Bush's basic mistake of going to war unilaterally must be overcome. Bush clings to Iraq as though it was some kind of prize America has won, as though Americans desire the burden that occupation and subjugation bring.

<p>Reality is that most Americans would willingly accept sharing the prize and a reduction of the burden.

<p>We need a new Security Council resolution prompting other nations to help by ceding to the United Nations political and peacekeeping authority in Iraq during a short transitional phase.

<p>Such a resolution would bring immediate international support of the kind we have seen in Bosnia (the European Union), Kosovo (the United Nations) and Afghanistan (NATO). It would bring support from key nations that could most help in the stabilization of Iraq, nations such as Germany, France, India and Russia.

<p>The resolution would stress that the U.N. peacekeepers are there at the invitation of Iraqis, and their mandate will last no longer than Iraqis desire.
<p>No question that many nations are enjoying the disaster Bush has delivered to America, for example, Russia. Russians have not forgotten the glee of U.S. policy-makers during Moscow's disastrous Afghanistan occupation in the 1980s.
<p>Still, many nations have indicated a willingness to help behind the right U.N. authorization. No nation gains from letting Iraq sink deeper into the chaos Bush has wrought.

<p>During the peacekeeping period, a representative council of Iraqis would be formed to replace the U.S. occupation administration and the present U.S.-imposed governing council, which has little indigenous support. As in Afghanistan, the interim regime would be composed of people representing the major political, ethnic, religious and tribal groups.

<p>The Iraqi army would be reconstituted. There is broad agreement today that disbanding it was a mistake. Prior to occupation, some 1 million Iraqis were employed directly by the state, about half that number in the armed forces. These people today are unemployed and hostile.

<p>Troops of the former army, unlike their commanders, were composed mainly of Shiites, not Baathists loyal to Saddam Hussein. Ex-Baathist officers would not be rehired. 

<p>America's financial commitment to Iraq would remain. The $87 billion voted by Congress for Iraq would not be diminished, but its proportions, 75 percent for occupation and 25 percent for reconstruction, would be reversed. Destroying a nation's infrastructure creates obligations.

<p>Iraqis and Americans, in consultation, would determine how the money is to be spent.

<p>This program could work. Bush's program cannot work.

<p>Bush's error, the mote in his eye stuck there by his neoconservative nation-builders, has been to believe that U.S. occupation could remake Iraq in the American image. It is not working, and a Vietnam-strategy of sending more troops, staying longer, laying more razor wire and killing more Iraqis isn't the answer.

<p>When you're headed for the rocks, full steam ahead is a poor solution. We need a new course in Iraq.
