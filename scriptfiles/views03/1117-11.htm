<p>It is baffling that any American might not understand the Iraqi disdain of 
a US military occupation. How would Americans like being accosted by another country's 
military...being arrested by them, controlled by them, dictated to by them, tortured 
by them, killed by them.... exploited by its corporate entities and losing sovereignty? 
Americans should look at the Philippines' century long struggle for some answers 
to that question. 
<p> Bush referred to the Philippines as a model for the US relationship 
with Iraq and I would like to briefly describe that model. It was and remains 
a fiasco and tragedy. After being occupied directly or indirectly by the United 
States since the Philippine-American War (1899-1902), the Philippines has been 
victimized in this relationship. While the Filipino elite have always benefited 
from US interference in their country, the masses have suffered indignities, violence, 
extreme poverty, racism and no substantive reforms. <p> It is particularly important 
to highlight the initiation of "low intensity conflict" policies by the United 
States against Filipinos in 1901 - a practice the US continued to implement throughout 
the 20th century in Vietnam, Angola, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Columbia and elsewhere. 
<p> During the Spanish-American War in the late 1890's, US Commodore George Dewey 
descended upon the shores of the Philippines and destroyed the Spanish fleet in 
Manila Bay. Americans had a number of goals for occupying the Philippines. One 
was to create a military presence to then access the markets of China. The second 
was to utilize the Philippine raw materials for US industry. US President William 
McKinley described the third. After praying to "Almighty God", McKinley said that 
a message came to him that Americans were in the Philippines to "uplift and civilize 
and christianize" Filipinos. He was obviously not aware of the fact that the Filipinos 
had been "christianized" for 400 years by Spanish colonizers, against whom they 
had consistently rebelled. <p> As Howard Zinn notes in his People's History of 
the United States, the "Filipinos did not get the same message from God" and the 
resistance to US military intervention began in 1899 in what has remained, up 
to the present time, organized efforts by Filipinos in opposition to US interference. 
<p> Initially, Filipinos thought that the Americans were there to help them kick 
out the Spanish and end 400 years of repression. After fruitless attempts to negotiate, 
however, the reality of the US intention became clear. The Filipinos were forced 
to acknowledge that the Americans intended to replace the Spanish as the colonial 
rulers. In The Philippines Reader, Daniel Schirmer and Stephen Shalom provide 
first hand accounts of this period. On February 5, 1899 Philippine President Emilio 
Aguinaldo urged his people to fight in response to the "outbreak of hostilities 
between the Philippine forces and the American forces of occupation, (which were) 
unjustly and unexpectedly provoked by the latter.... The constant outrages and 
taunts, which have caused the misery of the people...and finally the useless conferences 
and contempt shown the Philippine government prove the premeditated transgression 
of justice and liberty." <p> The American reaction was swift and the slaughter 
by US forces is legendary. Philippine scholar Luziminda Francisco refers to that 
brutal imperial American war that launched the 20th century as the "first Vietnam 
War" in which estimates of from 600,000 to a million Filipinos died. She states 
that the estimate of up to a million deaths might "err on the side of understatement" 
as one US congressman, who visited the Philippines at the time, was quoted as 
saying "They never rebel in Luzon (Philippines) anymore because there isn't anybody 
left to rebel...our soldiers took no prisoners, they kept no records, they simply 
swept the country and wherever and whenever they could get hold of a Filipino 
they killed him." <p> In response to a massacre of 54 Americans by the Filipino 
resistance in Samar, Francisco describes how US General "Howling Jake" Smith launched 
a "reign of terror" on the island. "Kill and burn..." Smith said "the more you 
kill and burn the more you'll please me." When asked the age limit for killing, 

he said, "Everything over ten." The order from Smith was that Samar becomes a 
"howling wilderness" so that "even the birds could not live there." The Americans 
had begun to utilize the deadly "water torture" against Filipinos - forcing huge 
amounts of water into their stomachs to then gather information - and Smith insisted 
on its use in Samar. <p> There were four US regiments of Black soldiers in the 
Philippines during the Philippine-American War. Many were outraged at the abuses 
and attitude of the white soldiers toward the Filipinos. Zinn refers to a letter 
from a volunteer from the state of Washington who wrote: "Our fighting blood was 
up, and we all wanted to kill 'niggers'.... this shooting human beings beats rabbit 
hunting all to pieces." David Fagan, one of the Black soldiers, left the US ranks 
to fight along side Filipinos and "for two years wreaked havoc upon the American 
forces." <p> The Philippine resistance fought valiantly against the well-armed 
Americans. Francisco states that the "Filipinos had to adapt to their limitations 
as best they could...with darts, the ubiquitous bolo, and even stones, prompting 
(US) General Lawton to remark, 'they are the bravest men I have ever seen'...." 
<p> It is also noteworthy that once the Americans captured Aguinaldo in April 
1901 they expected hostilities to cease and were "dismayed" that this was not 
the case. As the movement against the American presence had massive support, the 
fighting continued "unabated." This revelation led the leader of the US campaign, 
General Arthur MacArthur, to resign. <p> The American policy was so brutal that 
even American personnel were skeptical. Francisco quotes a US civil servant in 
the Philippines at the time who said that because of the "burning, torture and 
other harsh treatments" the Americans were "sowing the seeds for a perpetual revolution. 
If these things need to be done, they had best be done by native troops so that 
the people of the U.S. will not be credited therewith." Obviously this warning 
was heeded, as in 1901 the Americans created the Philippine Constabulary, comprised 
of Filipinos, who would work at the behest of and ruthlessly serve US interests 
during the U.S. colonization of the Philippines. <p> With its creation of the 
Philippine Constabulary (PC), the United States launched its "low intensity conflict" 
(LIC) strategy in the Philippines - in other words "don't get the US hands dirty, 
let someone else do the brutal work." So while it might be "low" intensity for 
the United States, it is exceptionally "high" intensity for its victims. The PC 
is still in existence today, and its reactionary and mercenary origins have remained 
in tact. Throughout the 20th century it has played a key role in suppressing peasant 
revolts and anti-US intervention movements. <p> At the end of World War II the 
Americans claim to have given the Philippines its independence. The US, however, 
insisted on maintaining a military presence in the country, with its major bases 
being Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base. In return for these bases the 
US offered the Filipino elite the creation of the "Joint US Military Advisory 
Group" (JUSMAG) to help reassert its authority over the peasant movements for 
land reform and other issues objectionable to them. <p> The resistance to the 
US interference has always been intense in the Philippines. Nationalist movements 
and armed struggle from the early occupation period to the Hukbalahap guerrilla 
movement after World War II to the New People's Army in the 1960's through to 
the present, including, of course, peasant movements for land reform, factory 
workers rights, on and on. In every instance the US administration and US military 
have worked in tandem with their Filipino government and military counterparts 
in an attempt to ruthlessly quell these movements. <p> After Filipinos had successfully 
ousted the dictator and American puppet Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, the goal of 
many was to continue on that wave of success by attempting to end US interference 
altogether - particularly by ousting the US military bases. While many Filipinos 

demanded countless reforms from the new government of President Corie Aquino, 
they recognized that the American military presence and CIA involvement made their 
reform efforts next to impossible. The Military Bases Agreement (MBA) that allowed 
the US bases to stay in the Philippines was to expire in 1991 and the Philippine 
Senate, to the dismay of the Americans, did vote against the extension of the 
agreement, which finally closed that disastrous chapter in Philippine history. 
Prior to that vote, however, violence raged in the Philippines. <p> To organize 
against the extension of the MBA, a broad based anti-bases and nationalist movement 
developed in the Philippines in the 1980's. The US intention, however, was to 
maintain its bases, and to accomplish that the CIA hired retired US General John 
Singlaub (head of the World Anti-Communist League) to launch a relentless and 
cruel LIC campaign (1987-1989). President Aquino assisted in this effort in what 
the Filipinos refer to as "Total War" against the people. The result was a rise 
of death squads, vigilante violence, human rights abuses and massive numbers of 
refugees from evacuated areas. Assassinations and harassments of church workers, 
labor leaders, peasant leaders and others became a daily occurrence. In 1989, 
US Colonel James Rowe of JUSMAG, who had been training the Philippine military 
in LIC strategies, was assassinated in Manila. <p> While the Filipinos have had 
brief respite, since 1991, of living without the presence of the huge US military 
bases, JUSMAG has remained in tact and the Bush administration is attempting to 
reverse some of that victory. Today, in violation of the Philippine constitution, 
which does not allow foreign troops on Philippine soil, the Bush administration 
successfully lobbied Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to send US troops 
into the Philippine hinterlands. The goal, according to Bush, is to destroy Muslim 
terrorists. Once again, in the Philippines, there is a growing movement to oust 
the US military (see <A HREF="http://www.nispop.org" TARGET="_new">www.nispop.org</A>). 
<p> The United States began the last century with an imperial war in Asia. It 
now is repeating the process at the beginning of the 21rst century with an intensive 
imperial reach into the Middle East and the parallels are striking. The invasion 
of the Philippines by the US was a preemptive, unprovoked war against a sovereign 
nation, as was the case in Iraq. As the Americans chose to occupy the Philippines 
for access to its raw materials and other markets, so too are they wanting access 
to Iraqi oil resources, markets and other resources of the Middle East. As Filipinos 
immediately began a resistance campaign against the Americans, so too are the 
Iraqis. McKinley launched an LIC policy in the Philippines, and George Bush is 
about to utilize the same policy in Iraq through what he is referring to as "Iraqification". 
"Iraqification" calls for the selection of former Iraqi military and/or police 
to serve at the behest of the Americans. Iraqi's hired by the US will strike against 
those reacting against the US military occupation and as a consequence will suffer 
the blows. It will be Iraqi's against Iraqi's with the United States pulling the 
strings. <p> Throughout the past century, the low intensity conflict policy implemented 
by the United States in Asia, Africa and Latin America has wreaked havoc, death 
and destruction and the Filipinos have experienced more than 100 years of these 
policies. It is important to note, however, that despite of the violent attempts 
by the United States to pacify the Filipinos, it has never been successful in 
ending the opposition to US interference in Philippine affairs or in stopping 
the Filipino struggles for the creation of a sovereign and free nation. As was 
the case at the very beginning of the 20th century when the masses in the Philippines 
continued their battle against the Americans after the capture of Aguinaldo, at 
every juncture, the Filipinos have continued to organize against the American 
presence. <p> It is highly unlikely that opposition to US interference in Iraq 

or in the Philippines will end now or any time in the future. History is not on 
the side of the occupiers. No one wants them. <p><I> For 12 years Ms. Gray has produced "Just Peace" on WRFG-Atlanta
