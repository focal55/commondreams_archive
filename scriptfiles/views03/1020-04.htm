<p>Former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney was playing fast and loose with the truth when, during a Sept. 14 interview on "Meet the Press," he claimed that "since I left Halliburton to become George Bush's vice president, I've severed all ties with the company, gotten rid of all my financial interest. I have no financial interest in Halliburton of any kind and haven't had now for over three years." 

<p>As it turns out, in 2001 Cheney pocketed $205,298 in deferred salary that was paid by Halliburton. In 2002, he collected $162,392. And he is scheduled to collect similar amounts in 2003, 2004 and 2005. And Cheney has retained unexercised options for 433,000 Halliburton stock shares. 

<p>It sure doesn't sound like the vice president has "severed all ties" to his former firm. 

<p>And it sure doesn't sound like Cheney ought to be trusted as an honest player in the debate over whether to allocate $87 billion to fund the military occupation of Iraq and reconstruction of that country's oil industry infrastructure. Halliburton has already received $1.4 billion for work done to restore Iraqi oil production. The maximum value for its occupation management contracts is $2 billion; the maximum value for its reconstruction contracts is $7 billion. 

<p>Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., says, "Halliburton got special treatment." Cheney says that's not the case. We believe Waxman. 

<p>We also believe that Congress must police this administration. Unfortunately, the Senate on Thursday rejected an amendment to the administration's $87 billion Iraq spending package that was written to prevent further fiscal abuses. Sponsored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the amendment would have barred funds from going to contracts with companies that owe deferred compensation to Cheney and 21 other administration officials. It was defeated by a 65-34 vote, with only Democrats (including Wisconsin's Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl) voting to impose basic ethical standards.
