<p>The ideals and values expressed in the written

words of our Founding Fathers continue to dominate our

loftiest expectations of our nation.  America

represents democracy.  We identify our nation with

liberty, equality, truth, justice, civil rights,

humanity, dignity, integrity, progressiveness, and

freedom.  We picture ourselves as a role model for

other nations, a measure towards which they should

strive, a trusted friend and partner.



<p>Star Trek optimistically envisions the future of

our planet as a time during which all people will

unite and work harmoniously together.  We will join

peoples from other worlds in forming an egalitarian

federation that obeys the prime directive of never

interfering in the internal affairs of other nations

and peoples, that strives for compassion and

understanding, and that considers societies dominated

by the desire for monetary gain and conquest as

primitive.



<p>President Bush offers America a totally different

future.



<p>Much of his vision derives from that of the Project

for the New American Century: as the world's only

superpower the United States should dominate the

world's resources for economic, strategic, and

political advantage.  From that commanding position

the US can build an empire unencumbered by the rules, regulations, and requirements of others. 

Domestically, business interests and the enrichment of America's most wealthy individuals supersede all other interests, needs, and rights.



<p>Star Trek would likely portray the PNAC as a

radical neoconservative fringe group with strong

upper-level government connections and members bent on pillaging the riches of the world and subverting the interests of their government and its people for their own selfish goals and profit.  



<p>Mr. Bush now intends to export his vision of

democracy to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the rest of the

Middle East.

          

<p>Shortly after terrorists slammed airplanes into the

World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing over

three thousand people, Mr. Bush sought retribution

from those responsible for attacking these symbols of capitalism and militarism.  He claimed they attacked symbols of democracy and liberty. History may side with Mr. Bush: democracy and liberty just might equal capitalism imposed by military means. 



<p>While our Founding Fathers spoke and wrote

eloquently, they also predominantly represented the

interests of business and the land's most wealthy

individuals.  Historians argue they chose their lofty

words to help recruit more soldiers and support from

the lower classes of colonial society for the

Revolution.  They designed a government that excluded

the native people, slaves, non-landowners, and women

from voting and other rights.  



<p>Throughout our nation's history many other leaders

have spoken great words, sometimes meaningfully, too

often manipulatively, while government and business

have predominantly worked hand in hand.  Yet the

historic preeminence of such practices does not

necessarily validate their desirability or

correctness. 

 

<p>In spite of whatever might have been the real

intentions behind our Founding Fathers great words,

many Americans truly believe in the ideals and values

they expressed.  Many also believe in those envisioned

by Star Trek.

 

<p>Before Mr. Bush progresses too far in imposing his

concepts on the rest of the world, the people of this

nation should determine whether or not they agree with

his vision.  A national forum should develop to openly

explore, debate, and determine the position of the

American people on the major issues that define our

nation and chart our future.  We should reassess

America's goals, values, ideals, and mission.

    

<p>Americans could choose whether they prefer a

government run as a government or a government run as

a business.  In the process of reaching such a basic

decision debates would likely surface over such topics

as national health insurance, privatized water

systems, ending mail delivery to those in outlying

areas, and letting the poor starve and the weak die.



<p>Americans could decide whether they want people or

money to control their government, whether they want

increased civil rights and liberties or increased

government surveillance and restrictions, whether they

want freedom of information or even greater media

consolidation and greater corporate and government

secrecy, whether they want more financial independence

or more power and wealth to consolidate into fewer and

fewer hands, and whether they want international

relations conducted through building friendships and understanding among equals or as superiors solving problems militarily, bombing other nations into submission, and building an empire.  

   

<p>Some degree of urgency exists in creating such a

forum since without it Mr. Bush's representation of

our essence wins by default.  Americans still have a

choice: the future promised by our Founding Fathers

and envisioned by Star Trek or the one proposed by Mr.

Bush.

 

<p>The world awaits our decision.
