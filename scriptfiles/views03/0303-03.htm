<p>Stark oppositions are not often visible in the affairs of nations; a gentle diplomacy is intended to smooth over differences when they arise. But something deadly serious is happening that may well disrupt the course of internationalism as we know it. It's an old-fashioned tug of war -- a more dignified facsimile of the kind we all remember from the schoolyards of our distant childhood. It's a watershed in world affairs. It's about the very <I>raison d'&#234;tre </I>and future of the United Nations.</P><!-- /Summary -->
<P>President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have argued that the UN will slide into obscurity if the members of the Security Council do not conclude that Saddam Hussein has failed to meet his obligations under Resolution 1441 -- thereby opening the way to an attack on Iraq by the so-called &#34;Coalition of the Willing.&#34; In other words, the continued relevance of the UN depends on reading the intent of the resolution in an appropriately forceful way. It depends on saying &#34;Enough!&#34; and calling Saddam Hussein's bluff about disarmament; and also, on the assumption that war is now the only way to promote this end.</P>
<P>France, along with Germany, also thinks the UN may fail -- but for the opposite reasons. At the last meeting of the Security Council, France lay claim to the idealism embedded in Charter itself. France's Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin, reminded the assembly that, in the shocked aftermath of the Second World War, the founders of the United Nations committed themselves to the idea that force is always a last resort and an admission of failure. For Mr. de Villepin and his colleagues in the &#34;Coalition of the Unwilling,&#34; the UN will lose its credibility if it is untrue to its origins: if it declines to seek international security with more peaceful solutions -- especially where there is neither an evident nor an immediate threat.</P>
<P>Just as interesting were the implications of a passing phrase. Mr. de Villepin spoke of the UN as &#34;a temple&#34; -- a &#34;church&#34; in other words -- a locus of the secular humanism and universalism that have been integral to French culture for the past 200 years (though called into question by the Collaboration) and the de facto &#34;religion&#34; of many throughout the West.</P>
<P>By contrast, George W. Bush draws his deepest inspiration from traditional Christianity as he understands and practices it. Just weeks ago, he told a group gathered for the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington that &#34;Events aren't moved by blind change and chance. Behind all of life and all of history, there's a dedication and purpose set by the hand of God.&#34;</P>
<P>David R. Gergen, a man who has worked in the four preceding administrations, observed, &#34;He has made it clear that he feels that providence intervened to change his life, and now he is somehow an instrument of providence.&#34;</P>
<P>There it is: The United Nations as seen through the lens of disparate commitments. And the United Nations threatened with extinction -- from both ends of the spectrum.</P>
<P>The Charter of the United Nations also speaks of international law and justice; and as war shadowed the last report of Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei to the Security Council, an equally seminal event was taking place elsewhere in New York City. The new International Criminal Court was electing 18 judges from across the world to serve in its ranks. They will be sworn in March 11 in The Hague. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands will host a formal opening ceremony to mark the historic occasion, along with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</P>
<P>The ICC has been called the &#34;missing link&#34; in the international legal order. Conceived by the United Nations and modeled on the post-war Nuremberg trials, it is mandated to try people accused of perpetrating the worst breaches of human laws -- genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes -- when the home country is either unable or unwilling to do so. Violence, the massacres of innocent, defenseless persons, forced exiles, extermination camps, ethnic cleansing and torture . . . for the first time a permanent international tribunal will try to confront this lethal impunity and serve as a deterrent.</P>
<P>What are its chances for success? Just as the future of the United Nations is threatened by contradictory ideologies and an imbalance of political power, so the celebrations at The Hague will be chilled by the reality that the United States, which originally signed on to the ICC, has withdrawn its support and is militantly opposed.</P>
<P>In spite of careful safeguards to prevent abuse, the Americans have cast doubt on the independence of the future ICC prosecutor, suggesting that their military and politicians may be the target of politically motivated accusations. Unwilling to submit to the procedures of international justice on an equal basis, the Bush administration has pressured a number of mostly small (and needy) countries to sign bilateral accords not to send Americans to the ICC for war crimes. Behind the festivities, there will be worry: The embryonic court will open for business next summer, but without U.S. support it may be born handicapped.</P>
<P>The underlying question is whether or not the multilateralism that is the bedrock of the United Nations and the ICC can survive in the era of a single, unopposed power.</P>
<P>Ironically, the twin UN mandates of &#34;peace and justice&#34; will both be tested soon. Mr. Blix will address the Security Council again on March 7, spurring a quick decision on war, just days before the inauguration of the ICC. Whatever the outcome (and it may take months or years before long-term fallout is visible), the next weeks may determine the future of the UN. This, along with the success or failure of the new ICC, will help to shape the direction of the century.</P>
