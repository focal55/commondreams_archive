<p>"God gave me my money," declared John
D. Rockefeller in the audacious style of the robber
barons who ruled America in the late 19th century.
But nowadays when the rich amass huge fortunes
at the expense of everyone else, and use their
political clout to rig the rules of the game, they
have more sophisticated justifications.
Increasingly, these take the form of economic
arguments -- generally flawed ones.

<p>The World Trade Organization is bringing
ministers from 146 countries -- as well as many non-governmental organizations -- to the resort city of Cancun, Mexico this week. One issue that almost collapsed these negotiations before they started is international trade in pharmaceuticals. On one side are most developing countries and humanitarian groups such as Doctors Without Borders, who want poor people to have access to cheap, generic, essential medicines. Against this proposition stand the big pharmaceutical companies, backed by their governments in the United States and Europe. They want U.S.-style patent laws enforced throughout the world, as much as possible.

<p>The conventional wisdom is that the
advocates for poor people have moral and
political arguments on their side, but the drug
companies have powerful economic arguments.
Because of this widespread perception, the
negotiations between the two sides are seen -- or
at least reported in the media -- as a legitimate
process designed to reach a balance that is in the
public interest.

<p>But as any economist knows, the strongest
economic arguments are on the side of Doctors
Without Borders. A patent monopoly is very
much like a tariff except that it is collected by a
private company, rather than a government. Like
tariffs, patents cause economic distortions and
inefficiency, in addition to redistributing income.

<p>And since patents can raise the price of
medicines by several multiples of 100 percent,
they are often tens or even hundreds of times
more inefficient than tariffs, which raise the price
of traded goods such as orange juice or steel by a
small fraction of these amounts. Just look at the anti-retroviral drugs that are used to treat
HIV/AIDS: the patent-protected price is over
$8,000 a year, while the generic equivalent costs
less than $300.

<p>Economists who are consistent with their
belief in free trade -- for example Columbia
University's Jagdish Bhagwati, one of this
country's leading international economists --
oppose the use of the WTO to enforce patent
monopolies. This makes sense: if you really
believe in free trade, you would want free
international trade in medicines, where the cost of protectionism is higher than in almost any other industry.
<p>This issue, more than any other, shows
how inaccurate and misleading it is to describe the
WTO (or the proposed Free Trade Area of the
Americas, or NAFTA) as a "free trade"
agreement. In fact, the World Bank's own
research shows that developing countries stand to
lose more from the implementation of the WTO's
rules on intellectual property (e.g. patents and
copyrights) than they would gain from complete
market access to the rich countries for all of their
exports. In other words, the protectionism that
these agreements lock in for pharmaceutical and
other special interests is more significant, from a
purely economic point of view, than their removal
of remaining trade barriers by the developed
countries.

<p>The pharmaceutical companies contend
that their profits must be protected from
international generic competition, or there will be
no incentive to develop new drugs. But clearly
this is not true in the developing world, where this
research does not take place. And even in the
United States, where about half of all biomedical
research is already funded by government and
non-profit sources, it is a dubious argument. Here
in the world's richest country, the waste and
inefficiency of the patent system has spun so far
out of control that we cannot even afford to pay
for prescription drugs for our elderly.

<p>An agreement was reached at the end of
last month, which would allow some more leeway
for some developing countries to import generic
drugs, thus saving the Cancun ministerial meeting
from collapse over this issue. But there is no
reason for developing countries to trade away
their rights to free trade in medicines. Stripped of
its flawed economic arguments, the use of the
WTO to force U.S.-style patent laws on the rest of
the world can be seen for what it really is:
protectionist greed, on a scale that would make
our 19th century robber barons blush.
