<p>I'm pregnant again. Lumbering, achy and exhausted, I'm in my 27th week. It's been a tough pregnancy, as I'm working full time and caring for my 2-year-old daughter. 

<p>I'm excited and happy about the baby but I'm also 30 pounds beyond my "ideal" weight and I'm feeling a bit, shall we say, moody.

<p>I got a whole lot crankier recently, not to mention alarmed, with the passage of the so-called partial-birth legislation banning late-term abortions. I'm not upset because I was planning to dash down to Planned Parenthood on my lunch break to terminate this pregnancy. 

<p>On the contrary, the very thought of losing this deeply wanted second baby has me up late at night, shivering with anxiety.

<p>No, I'm angry because my government -- that bastion of male power and influence known as Congress -- has decided that my one-pound, non-voting, non-taxpaying fetus has more value than I do. Under the legislation, which President Bush has signed, late-term abortions would be inaccessible to protect the health and well-being of pregnant women.

<p>I could talk about the cynicism of a "pro-life" president who has yet to attend the funeral of a single soldier killed in Iraq, or an administration that shamelessly offers up women's lives with a ban transparently designed to court votes from the right. I could promulgate the justifiable feminist argument that men have no business making life and death decisions about women's bodies. Or I could point to glaring problems with the legislation, such as its unconstitutionality and vagueness and to widespread physician opposition to a law seen as "inappropriate, ill advised and dangerous" (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists).

<p>But I'd rather "focus on the family," my family. Imagine for a moment, as I have in the dark, cold night, that I become seriously ill during this pregnancy. Perhaps I develop a heart condition or uterine cancer or severe preeclampsia. Imagine that my treatment "options" come down to a choice between my health and life or that of my unborn baby, and that my grief knows no bounds.

<p>We know where the federal government stands on this dilemma: My life is not worth saving if it means terminating my fetus in the process. 

<p>An exemption to save the life of a pregnant woman means nothing in the absence of an exemption for health problems. The selfless, maternal thing to do, according to these mostly Republican politicians, is to sacrifice my own well-being, and perhaps even my existence, for the sake of the creature in my womb.

<p>But what would this mean for my family? My sweet, funny daughter, who smells of honeysuckle and apples, would be left without a mother. My partner, a wonderful and caring dad, would be left to raise her on his own, without my help and support. And my family would be much worse off financially, as my paycheck is sorely needed and my partner's job requires significant travel.

<p>Congress and the president claim that the fetus I am nurturing is worth more than my health and life. But my fetus is also, apparently, worth more than the life and welfare of my daughter, the ability of my partner to be an effective father and the economic security -- indeed, the very survival -- of our family.

<p>Will this legislation "save" some babies from late-term abortion, a quite rare procedure? Maybe, maybe not. I do know that conservatives will cease to care about these babies once they are born. After all, we do not live in a child-friendly society, nor does the current administration put a premium on those things that enhance the lives of children: quality time with their parents, good schools and child care, adequate nutrition and health care, freedom from contamination by pollutants, security in their homes and on the streets.

<p>I believe that my fetus has value to politicians only because it is a powerful symbol. The partial-birth legislation sends a false message that Congress and Bush are doing their part to "help babies" and to promote families by stopping abortion, while in reality, these ideologues are putting children, parents and families in harm's way.

<p>It seems to me that if Congress and Bush were really pro-life and supportive of families, the health and survival of mothers would be their highest priority. 

<p>Their belief, now enshrined in law, that fetuses are worth more than mothers is painfully clear.
