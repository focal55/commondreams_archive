<p>In a democracy, leaders must earn and retain the public's trust. No 
matter how loudly those leaders proclaim their dedication to fighting 
terrorism, we must not flinch from examining whether they are 
trustworthy. 

<p>On March 17, 2003, in a major address to the American people, President 
George W. Bush declared: "Intelligence gathered by this and other 
governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess 
and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised." On April 10, 
in a televised message to the people of Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Blair 
said: "We did not want this war. But in refusing to give up his weapons 
of mass destruction, Saddam gave us no choice but to act." 
<p>Before and during the war on Iraq, we heard many other such statements 
from top officials in Washington and London. Ostensibly they justified 
the war. 

<p>Among the horrors of that war are weapons known as cluster bombs. I use 
the present tense because now - months after the Pentagon and the 
British military dropped thousands of cluster bombs on Iraq - they 
continue to explode, sometimes in the hands of children who pick them 
up. At high velocity, those bombs fire shards that slice into human 
flesh. 

<p>We might say that the cluster bombs are terrifying weapons. We might say 
that they - and the leaders who authorized their use - are still 
terrorizing people in Iraq. 

<p>In the long run, if leaders want to gain and maintain trust, it's 
helpful for their logic to be reasonably plausible rather than 
Orwellian. But when there is no single standard that reliably condemns 
"terrorism," then the word serves as a political football rather than a 
term to be used with integrity. Unfortunately, in common usage of the 
word, it is not the wanton cruelty or the magnitude of murderous actions 
that determines condemnation, but rather the nationalistic and political 
contexts of those actions. 

<p>It would be bad enough if the leaders of the Washington-London axis of 
"anti-terrorism" were merely duplicitous in their rationales for going 
to war. Or it would be bad enough if those leaders were honest about 
their reasons while ordering their own activities that terrorize 
civilians. But flagrant dishonesty is integral to broader and deeper 
problems with basic policies that tacitly distinguish between "worthy" 
and "unworthy" victims - that encourage us, in effect, to ask for whom 
the bell tolls. The official guidance needn't be explicit to be well 
understood or at least widely internalized: Do not let too much empathy 
move in unauthorized directions. 

<p>For instance: One searches in vain for a record of Washington condemning 
its ally Turkey while, in recent years, Turkey's government drove 
millions of Kurdish people from their homes, destroyed thousands of 
villages, killed many thousands of Kurds and inflicted horrific torture. 
To take another example: The war on Iraq has been praised for closing 
down the regime's torture chambers. Meanwhile, billions of dollars in 
aid continue to flow from Washington to the Egyptian government, which 
operates torture chambers for political prisoners. One might think that 
an appropriate way to oppose torture would be to stop financing it. 

<p>President Bush routinely denounces terrorists who engage in deadly 
attacks that take the lives of Israeli civilians. But he never applies 
similar denunciations to the U.S.-backed Israeli government leaders, who 
often order attacks that predictably take the lives of Palestinian 
civilians. 

<p>Years before the crime against humanity known as 9/11, the scholar Eqbal 
Ahmed pointed out: "A superpower cannot promote terror in one place and 
reasonably expect to discourage terrorism in another place. It won't 
work in this shrunken world." To deserve public trust, anything called a 
"war on terrorism" would need to be guided by genuine moral precepts 
rather than public relations maneuvers to mask ongoing patterns of 
hypocrisy. 

<p>On May 28, a report by Amnesty International condemned the American and 
British governments for a so-called war on terror that actually 
emboldens many regimes to engage in terrible abuses of human rights. 
Amnesty's Secretary-General Irene Khan said that "what would have been 
unacceptable on September 10, 2001, is now becoming almost the norm" - 
while Washington promotes "a new doctrine of human rights a la carte." 
She added: "The United States continues to pick and choose which bits of 
its obligations under international law it will use, and when it will 
use them." 

<p>Worldwide, it will be impossible to sustain public trust in 
anti-terrorist efforts without adhering to standards that consistently 
reject terrorism. Launching aggressive wars and providing massive 
support to abusers of human rights are themselves acts of terrorism - by 
the strong. They are sure to heighten rage and provoke acts of terrorism 
by the weak. 

<p>When a country - particularly a democracy - goes to war, the consent of 
the governed lubricates the machinery of killing. Silence is a key form 
of co-operation, but the war-making system does not insist on quietude 
or agreement. Mere passivity or self-restraint will suffice. 

<p>The world is now shadowed by a special relationship between two 
governments - the superpower and its leading enabler. In the name of 
moral leadership, they utilize deception. In the name of peace, they 
inflict war. In the name of fighting terrorism, they engage in 
terrorism. Such policies demand trust but deserve unyielding opposition.
