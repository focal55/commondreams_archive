<p> The defining characteristic of the Bush administration -- the feature that historians will cite as central to its performance in office -- is a fundamental and crippling distrust of information.

<p> That fear of information has been twofold. Most obviously, the Bush administration has fought harder than any in living memory against the release of information to the outside world, including the American public. Examples of that secrecy obsession are all too easy to find, and the two most serious are also the most recent.

<p> At the moment, the administration is refusing to surrender information requested by a national commission investigating the government's failure to anticipate the attacks of Sept. 11. The Republican chairman of the 9-11 commission, former Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, says the information is critical to the panel's important work, and he has threatened to subpoena the withheld documents if necessary.

<p> Simultaneously, the administration last week balked at requests from Congress for information about how it handled intelligence data prior to the invasion of Iraq. The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pat Roberts of Kansas, has also signed a letter threatening the use of subpoenas to drag the information into the open.

<p> That distrust of information also takes another, less traditional form. If Bush officials are wary about letting information out, they are even more reluctant to let information in. Guided more by ideology than practicality, they tend to treat information that contradicts their ideology as a threat that must be warded off at all costs.

<p> Time and again, on issues from the environment to national security, administration officials have sought and enthusiastically swallowed every nugget of undigested information that might bolster the conclusions they had already reached through ideology, while rejecting far more substantial information that might have forced them to reconsider, move more cautiously or even change course.

<p> That attitude has in some ways been a source of strength. It has allowed the administration to act with steadfast single-mindedness, immune to doubts and outside criticism. But it also has produced serious disasters.

<p> For example, when Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki warned back in February that occupying Iraq successfully would take hundreds of thousands of troops, his civilian bosses publicly rebuked the general and suggested that 60,000 troops would probably be sufficient. "I am reasonably certain that [the Iraqi people] will greet us as liberators; and that will help us to keep requirements down," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said, choosing what he wanted to believe over the expert testimony of Shinseki, who had actually led the occupation of Bosnia.

<p> In that and many other cases, the consequences of information phobia have run exceedingly deep. In essence, the Bush administration is denying itself the benefit of self-correcting mechanisms that have long made democracy the best form of government known to mankind.

 
<p> Democratic theory holds that open, well-informed discussion by citizens -- competition in the marketplace of ideas -- will in time produce the best policy. The Bush administration, however, believes that it has already decided upon the best policy, and that open, well-informed debate within its offices or in the country at large could only mislead people.

<p> So it attempts to deny people information that they would need to reach competing points of view. It attempts to silence others through intimidation or attacks on patriotism. It attempts to mislead if necessary. And any debate it fails to squelch through those means it simply chooses to ignore.

<p> That info-phobia even helps to explain the otherwise inexplicable claim by President Bush that the increase in attacks in Iraq is, in fact, proof of our growing success. Logically, that assertion makes no sense, because it implies that an absence of attacks would be proof that we are failing.

<p> But it demonstrates all too well the inability of this president to process information that might challenge his preconceived notions. Good news is good news. And bad news is good news.
