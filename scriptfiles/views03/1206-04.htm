<p>A warning to Minnesota citizens: church members, steelworkers, office workers, students, environmentalists, schoolteachers, retirees and others. Exercising your right to free speech, even at a permitted event, may be dangerous to your health. 

<p>Warren Goldstein's <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/1126-08.htm">Nov. 26 Commentary</a> page piece about attacks on free trade opponents in Miami sums up fairly well the degree of military buildup and intimidation that faced demonstrators. I attended -- or attempted to attend -- the rally and march on Nov. 20, where peaceful citizens from the above-mentioned walks of life were confronted by this huge and menacing force at every turn. 

<p>Why? Because we object to trade agreements that threaten our democracy, our jobs and our environment.

<p>Minnesotans now in a holiday mood may feel far from the distant events in Miami. But beyond the 300 or so people who made the trek from here, we are connected: Minnesota taxpayers helped to fund the riot police. 

<p>Federal tax dollars -- some of which came from Minnesota -- to the tune of $8.5 million were a big part of the approximately $11 million spent on security. 

<p>It makes me feel a little funny to think that I've paid taxes that in this direct and tangible way work against my freedom of speech. It makes me feel even stranger and more than a little scared knowing that the $8.5 million was shaved off the $87 billion intended to fight terrorism in Iraq. 

<p>As Goldstein says, in Miami, "all protesters were potential terrorists."

<p>How long before more teachers, office workers, church groups, environmentalists and other ordinary folk are targeted in this ever-expanding war on terrorism?
