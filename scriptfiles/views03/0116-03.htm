<p>MY 89-YEAR-OLD friend Alicia is angry because she can't march in San 

Francisco this Saturday. All her life, she has fought for civil rights and 

against unjust wars. Now, bound to a wheelchair, she is unable to walk. "If I 

were well and young," she says, her voice rising in indignation, "I would be 

there. So go tell all those young and able people that this war on Iraq is 

wrong."

<P>Alicia is hardly alone in wanting to express her opposition to a possible 

invasion of Iraq. The pope has called such a war "a defeat for humanity." 

During the next week, anti-war demonstrations will take place in at least 23 

countries, including Argentina, Canada, France, South Korea, Germany and 

Russia.

<P>On Saturday, this country will witness two large "National Marches in 

Washington, D.C., and San Francisco." The number of buses chartered by 

communities from Maine to Texas suggest that more than 150,000 marchers will 

descend on the nation's capitol for a peaceful march and rally against a war 

with Iraq.

<P>In San Francisco, organizers say they are bracing for a huge crowd as well. 

Buses will be arriving from as far as Canada and Idaho. "I'm bringing my 

grandkids," says one friend. "There's no better way to teach them how to be a 

citizen." She joins peace organizations, church groups and families with 

children who will arrive Saturday and assemble for an 11 a.m. opening rally at 

the foot of Market Street at the Embarcadero. Then they will march to Civic 

Center Plaza for a closing rally with speakers and cultural performances.

<P>Organizers chose this date because they believe it may be the last time 

Americans can prevent, rather than protest, a war with Iraq.

<P>But the day is also special because Monday commemorates the birthday of the 

Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. For many civil rights and peace activists, the 

march also honors the last year of King's life, when he broke his silence and 

denounced the Vietnam War.

<P>King rightly anticipated that all kinds of people would try to discredit 

him for his anti-war position. "I came to the conclusion," he told a stunned 

congregation at Riverside Church in New York City in 1967, "that there is an 

existential moment in your life when you must decide to speak for yourself; 

nobody else can speak for you."

<P>There is never a good time to oppose your government, he told them. "On 

some positions, cowardice asks the question, 'is it safe?' Expediency asks the 

question, 'Is it politic?' And vanity comes along and asks the question, 'Is 

it popular?' But conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' And there comes 

a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor 

popular, but he must do it because conscience tells him it is right."

<P>I still remember hearing King denounce the war that year. As I stood with 

other students at UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza, I heard King worry that he might 

be cast as a communist for opposing the war. But, he said, silence was far 

more dangerous. "Those of us who love peace," he urged, "must organize as 

effectively as the war hawks. As they spread the propaganda of war, we must 

spread the propaganda of peace."

<P>Like many other people, I rarely agree with the specific slogans or 

politics of those who happen to organize large protest marches. After hearing 

King speak that day, however, I realized that it's more important to oppose an 

unjust war than remain silent.

<P>I especially don't like to march under signs that express disrespect or 

hatred for my country. It's my nation's policies -- not its ideals or people --against which I bear witness. And so, I listen to the sage advice offered by 

one veteran peace activist: "Just bring your own sign."
