<p>Many religious conservatives contend that we live in a Christian country, founded by Christian men, dominated by people of the Christian faith. And you know what?

<p>They're right, we do. Culturally, historically and statistically, we are largely a Christian nation.

<p>But contrary to the hopes of some, we do not have -- and cannot have -- a Christian government. We cannot have Christian courts, Christian police, Christian social service agencies or a Christian foreign policy.

<p>Of course, that crucial distinction is always being tested, always under assault. It is, for example, the core inspiration behind efforts to place copies of the Ten Commandments in the Alabama Supreme Court building and in local courthouses around the country. The commandments are being used as a symbol of Christian dominance, planted in government buildings much like the flags that early explorers would stick into the earth to claim a spot for their king and country.

<p>It is a way of saying, "This is ours."

<p>Well, no, it isn't.

<p>As always, the main battleground in the war to maintain a secular government is the U.S. Supreme Court. This session, the justices will hear a case out of Washington state involving the so-called Blaine amendments, which were added to 37 state constitutions during the 19th century. The amendments typically bar any use of state money for religious-related purposes, putting a higher wall between church and state than the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

<p>The amendments were originally inspired by anti-Catholic prejudice, to prevent tax money from being spent on parochial schools. In Washington, however, the Blaine amendment means that college students who are studying for the clergy cannot participate in that state's scholarship programs.

<p>Religious groups claim that such a ban is unconstitutional, and they're probably right. Denying scholarship money to those studying to be a minister, while allowing it for would-be doctors and teachers, is antagonistic rather than neutral toward religion, and does indeed violate the First Amendment.

<p>The Washington suit is part of a larger crusade being launched against Blaine amendments all over the country, including Georgia, Florida and Massachusetts. The push is being led by advocates of school voucher programs, who see the amendments as legal obstacles to state funding of vouchers for religious-based schools.

<p>The Blaine amendments certainly ought to be rescinded, both because of their history and because they sometimes force unreasonable restrictions such as Washington's scholarship ban. But before we take the second step -- agreeing to the use of vouchers to finance religious-based schools -- a deeper look at the history behind the Blaine amendments might be in order.

<p>In the 19th century, most Americans believed that this was not merely a Christian nation, but more precisely a Protestant nation, and they acted accordingly. Bible instruction was common in public schools at the time, and they typically used the Protestant Bible as the textbook for such training.

<p>Catholic parents, understandably offended, wanted their own taxpayer-funded schools where their children could be taught from the Catholic Bible. That in turn outraged the Protestants, who didn't want their tax money used to support "The Scarlet Whore of Rome," as the pope was too-commonly called. The Blaine amendments were a direct consequence.

<p>Those issues -- those religious-based suspicions and fears -- have not gone away. If school vouchers become commonly available for use at religious schools, the Nation of Islam would have equal call on the public purse as the Baptists, meaning taxpayer money could be used to teach kids that white people are all blue-eyed devils. Fundamentalist Islam would have equal footing as well. Even cults such as the Branch Davidians, which taught that David Koresh was Jesus Christ, could not legally be denied taxpayer money for their schools.

<p>Surely the wiser approach is to teach religion at home and places of worship, without taxpayer involvement.
