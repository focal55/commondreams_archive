<p>Democracy works, albeit slowly. Military occupations don't, even if the occupiers have all the power and the occupied have very little. <P></P>In America and Britain &#8212; more so the latter, due no doubt to the parliamentary system &#8212; credible voices are being raised about the deceptive way George W. Bush and Tony Blair went to war in Iraq.<P></P>Democratic presidential candidates are, at last, puncturing the war president's halo to land some well-aimed punches.<P></P>"What did the president know and when did he know" about Iraqi nuclear, biological and chemical weapons? That's what Howard Dean asks, evoking Richard Nixon and Watergate.<P></P>"If George Bush won't trust America with the truth, then America shouldn't trust George Bush with the White House," says Bob Graham.<P></P>The president has "misled everyone of us," says John Kerry.<P></P>Secret reports are being leaked, showing how the CIA and others were cautious in assessing the Iraqi threat, especially Iraqi terror connections, but how the administration distorted the intelligence. Attorney-General John Ashcroft's anti-terror campaign is coming under scrutiny. Several members of Congress want an end to secret detentions and trials. <P></P>The Justice Department's ombud is probing the mistreatment of the hundreds of innocents arrested post-Sept. 11.<P></P>In Britain, two parliamentary panels are examining Blair's pre-war claims, especially that Saddam Hussein's weapons were "deployable within 45 minutes."<P></P>Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has admitted that the "dodgy dossier," the one alleging Saddam's Al Qaeda link, has been "a very great embarrassment."<P></P>Another claiming uranium shipment from Niger to Iraq, cited by both Bush and Blair, has been proven to be patently false.<P></P>An aide to Blair has apologized to the British intelligence service for, in effect, discrediting it by manipulating its reports.<P></P>This public debate has been a long time coming. It hopefully will get to the bottom of the scandal that should not be allowed to remain buried under a mountain of patriotic guff.<P></P>Post-war Iraq also illustrates how truth-telling does not come easily to Bush and Blair.<P></P>Their governments have offered varying explanations for the undiscovered weapons of mass destruction:
<ul>
  <li>The arms could have been shipped off to Syria. Or destroyed. Or "looted" &#8212; a scary thought, if they end up, ironically, in terrorist hands. <br> 
  </li>
  <li>The weapons are there and we must be patient &#8212; the very counsel Bush and Blair dismissed in the case of U.N. inspectors. <br> 
  </li>
  <li>We shouldn't care if no weapons are found. Wasn't Saddam a bad guy who once did possess them?  </li>
</ul>
    <P></P>
  Yes, but that was not the stated reason for going to war.
    <P></P>
  Similar dishonesty permeates the explanations about why Anglo-American troops have run into such sustained resistance.
    <P></P>
  Isolated "rogue groups," "foreign elements," and "Baathist remnants of Saddam's regime and its terrorist allies" are blamed and portrayed either as "sporadic and disorganized" or "organized and co-ordinated."  
  <P></P>
  They were said to be confined to the Sunni areas around Baghdad from where Saddam drew his support &#8212; until Tuesday's ambush on British forces in the anti-Saddam Shiite south.
    <P></P>
  While there are troublemakers aplenty, the truth is that most Iraqis oppose the occupation.
    <P></P>
  Public goodwill generated by toppling Saddam has all but dissipated, due largely to the Anglo-American unpreparedness to tackle post-war chaos and a series of political blunders, including the indefinite postponement of a plan to start handing over power to the Iraqis.
    <P></P>
  Iraq has been what New York would be with no cops for weeks. The looting has subsided, thanks in part to local clerics and tribal leaders, but lawlessness remains rampant. The most essential services are yet to be restored. Soldiers trained for war do not make good peacekeepers. Stories out of Iraq show a pattern: troops kicking in doors of modest homes and violating the privacy of women &#8212; the worst conceivable way of dealing with Arabs &#8212; and Americans, justifiably on guard for unprovoked attacks, resorting to indiscriminate force against ill-armed or unarmed civilians.
    <P></P>
  While 19 American soldiers have been killed since the end of the war, there is no knowing how many Iraqi civilians have died. Dozens? Hundreds?
    <P></P>
  The casual approach to local lives can be seen in the hunt for Saddam and sons. There were three bomb attacks on locations where they were supposed to be. While their fate remains unknown, many bystanders were turned to dust.
    <P></P>
  The Bush administration has appealed to 85 nations for troops. Few have responded.
    <P></P>
  In India, the idea of sending 17,000 soldiers has caused an uproar. "Irreparable damage will be done to India's reputation and good name, if our troops were sent to prop up the occupation of Iraq," write two former prime ministers, I.K. Gujral and V.P. Singh, in a rare criticism of the government of the day on foreign policy.
    <P></P>
  In Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf touched off a storm by saying he would consider sending 10,000 troops. He made the statement after meeting Bush at Camp David Tuesday and securing $3 billion (U.S.) for backing the war on terror.
    <P></P>
"His undertaking is not likely to be welcomed in the country where the majority of people view the Americans and the British as an occupation force in Iraq," says an editorial in the English daily The News.
    <P></P>
  International help would be more forthcoming if the job were to be given to the United Nations. But Bush won't agree.
    <P></P>
  Expect the 146,000 American and 15,000 British troops to stay on. As Senator Joseph Biden says, "Johnny and Jane ain't coming home anytime soon."
