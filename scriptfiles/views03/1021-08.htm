  <P>A two-year crusade of sorts by the Bush administration to mollify moderate Muslims and to try to defuse irrational hate of the West took a sudden and caroming turn last week. That happened when the news media reported Army Lt. Gen. William Boykin was telling church audiences full of evangelical Christians such as himself that the U.S. counter-terror war is a battle with "Satan."

</table>Boykin quickly apologized for those and other gratuitously inflammatory remarks. But a mere apology is not enough to repair the damage wrought by this new deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence. Too bad for this much-decorated and twice-wounded veteran of covert military operations. But intelligence is clearly not his forte. 
<P>Among other faux pas, this self-anointed religious warrior appeared in dress uniform and polished jump boots telling a church group in Oregon in June radical Islamists hate the United States "because we're a Christian nation, because our foundation and our roots are Judeo-Christian. And the enemy is a guy named Satan." Media reports also quote him as saying, "I knew my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol," while describing the battle against a Muslim warlord in Somalia. 
<P>"We in the army of God, in the house of God, kingdom of God have been raised for such a time as this," Boykin said last year. 
<P>Boykin's zealotry goes so far as to claim that God, not the American voting public, placed the current president in the White House. God? Excuse me, as far as I can tell, God is much too busy for politics (busy producing miracles, saving lives and the like). Oddly enough, Boykin's public pronouncements serve perfectly to deflate the attempts of his earthly (not godly) commander in chief. 
<P>President Bush has wooed Muslim leaders at the White House. He declared Islam to be a peaceful religion, not the embodiment of Satan. Bush's trip to Asia had him jetting through some of the most terror-ridden parts of the globe. Boykin's remarks seemed almost designed to stir up the very radicals the president is trying quiet down. 
<P>Yet Bush's chief lieutenant in the war on terror, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld laughed off reporters questions about the comments late last week, taunting reporters as a "blood-thirsty" bunch when they asked what he thought about Boykin's missives. 
<P>Rumsfeld's misplaced sense of humor aside, Boykin's statements would be comical if they were not so provocative and potentially damaging to international relations. Having spoken in uniform and as a high-ranking representative of the U.S. war on terror makes his actions all the more untenable. 
<P>To those who know religious history, Boykin comes across as a 21st century version of the European crusaders. That parallel is hardly a good one if the president's goal of eliminating terror is ever to be met. It does neither the U.S. nor this president in particular any good to inflame pre-existing misunderstanding and hatred of the West - just what Boykin's remarks succeeded in doing. 
<P>In "The Crusades thru Arab Eyes" historians Amin Maalouf and Jon Rothschild recount this formative event in Christian and Arab history. They (and other historians before them) recount the Crusades as a religious war launched by European evangelicals supposedly motivated by religious fervor to "reclaim" the holy land from "infidels." Instead they led one of the most barbarous, ferocious and inhumane campaigns known to humankind. They put "whole populations to the sword" and engaged in cannibalism. How Christian was that? While we in the West study the Crusades, it does not shape our worldview, as it still does for many middle easterners - precisely the populations with whom we are now trying to make peace. After the Crusades, the West began to blossom and Islam slid into cultural regression, isolation, and economic deprivation. Radical Islamic leaders use this history to fire anti-West passions and gain terrorist recruits. 
<P>If General Boykin understands this history, he surely ignored it when speaking to religious groups. If he doesn't understand it or know it, he has no business running our country's defense intelligence operations.
