<p>Anti-Americanism is spreading to Europeans who oppose a U.S.-attack on Iraq. 
<p>Just ask George Will.
<p>In a recent column, he leads by linking Europe's anti-Jewish past to fools 
who support socialism.  This might be news to persecuted European Jews who 
were also socialists.
<p>His muddy waters do run deep.  Will then draws a parallel between European 
Jewry persecuted for centuries and the current opposition to Washington's 
war hawks pressing to attack Iraq.
<p>In his view, the U.S. government is pursuing a resistance movement of sorts 
to topple a tyrant that a wrong-headed Europe losing economic power fails to 
see as public enemy number one.  Presumably, such clear-eyed recognition of 
the Iraqi threat to global peace and prosperity is the province of Americans 
like Will.
<p>For him, U.S. might makes right now, as it did during the Vietnam War and 
Cold War.  Europeans protesting these examples of U.S. military power have 
failed to grasp that their past flirtation with communism has rendered them 
now vulnerable to subjugation by the forces of oppression, personified by 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
<p>Who said red-baiting of Europeans was dead?  Quick, there's not much time 
left to rally round the flag of U.S. capitalism and its global battering ram 
of military force to make markets free and safe.
<p>According to Will, the one million anti-war protesters in Britain recently 
displayed a "moral infantilism" about the central role of U.S. power in 
making the U.N. disarm Iraq.  Arm-twisting weaker nations such as Turkey to 
support U.S.-led armed forces to topple Hussein from power, without or with 
a second U.N. resolution, must be a sign of moral maturity.
<p>Likewise, the properly educated know that nuclear-armed Israel poses no 
security threat to the region.  Perhaps Arabs and Jews who recently united 
for peace and justice in the streets of U.S. cities and in Tel Aviv are just 
wimps ready to appease evil.
<p>Just like anti-war Europeans voicing anti-American views against U.S. 
military aggression on Iraq.  Don't politics makes strange bedfellows in
<p>Will's moral universe?
<p>His ideological diplomacy versus European opposition to the war hawks in the 
Bush administration is a wonder to behold.  Accordingly, Israel's nuclear 
weapons are simply a non-issue.
<p>Should it be any surprise that Will is silent about the bitter fate of the 
Palestinian people living under Israeli occupation?  Recall that he is a
widely-published pundit who knows "moral infantilism" when he sees it on
European streets.
<p>Will also makes no mention of the lethal U.N. economic squeeze, backed by 
the U.S., of Iraq over the past 12 years that has led to the deaths of 
hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians.  Weapons of mass destruction 
that he can't see, indeed.
<p>In contrast to Will's ideology of U.S. imperial integrity, people in Europe 
and elsewhere around the world who are entering the public arena to protest 
a U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq are trying to civilize global 
society.  No matter that the names of these everyday folks probably won't be 
recorded in the history books.

<p>They don't write columns for mass media.  They don't regularly appear on
corporate talk TV.

<p>Will does both.  But ordinary people in Europe and globally are making their 
views on war and peace between the U.S. and Iraq known to the broader public 
without such access to corporate-owned media.

<p>In fact, those now rallying in European streets are trying to craft the 
answers and questions to the U.S. stalemate in the U.N. over Iraq. These 
protesters, with and against their elite leaders, aren't buying the military 
aggression being sold by the Bush White House as a war of self-defense for 
the security of the American people.

<p>Will echoes the president's statement that worldwide anti-war protests 
wouldn't change his timetable for war.  This pundit fairly drips vitriol for 
the "peaceniks" of Europe.

<p>The prospect that the European anti-war camp is quite relevant, perhaps more 
than is now understood, in its unity with like-minded people worldwide 
discomforts U.S. elites and their mouthpieces such as George Will.  So be 
it.
