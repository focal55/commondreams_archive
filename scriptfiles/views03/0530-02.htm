<p><i>“Bless: to invoke divine care for”

</i><br>
--Merriam-Webster Dictionary

 

<p><i>"There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says fool me once, shame on . . . shame on you . . . and fool me we can't get fooled again."</i>

<br>
--George W. Bush

 

<p><i>“If any question why we died,<br>
Tell them, because our fathers lied.”

</i><br>
--Rudyard Kipling

 

<p><i>“Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from.”

</i><br>
--Elizabeth Kubler-Ross

 

<p>Last Sunday I was challenged to bring two people into my consciousness—one person I loved deeply and one toward whom I felt no love at all. Then I was called upon to bless each of them. The one who I loved deeply was easy; I sent blessings to my wife, Shonnie. The other one was more problematic; I brought the face of George W. Bush into my consciousness and, with some hesitation, blessed him too.

 

<p>It’s easy to fall into an “us” versus “them” mentality, especially in times like these. Our nation’s leaders are taking actions that are just not OK with many of us. For example, we’re beginning to hear rumblings about the necessity of a regime change in Iran because that nation has connections with al Qaeda terrorists and has plans to build nuclear weapons. And though there is currently no evidence to support this thesis, some in Washington are spreading the rumor that Iran was involved in the suicide bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia earlier this month. Do they think we’re stupid, don’t really give a damn or just have extremely short memories? These are essentially the same motives that our president and his administration provided for our unprovoked attack on Iraq. And guess what? No Iraqi links to al Qaeda have been proven and no weapons of mass destruction have been found.

 

<p>So besides taking military action that resulted in the deaths of thousands, Americans and Iraqis alike (with more dying daily), we’ve been lied to. Barefaced, shameless fabrications by leaders who knew better, or who certainly should have. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

 

<p>Incidentally, if you ever thought that our military adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq (and coming soon—Iran!) were about fighting terrorism or freeing the peoples of those lands, you might want to check out The Project for the New American Century (www.newamericancentury.org). This group, founded in 1997 and led by Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, James Woolsey, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, William Bennett, Dan Quayle, Jeb Bush and others, developed the blueprint for U.S. world domination—a Pax Americana—using pre-emptive military strikes to subdue real or imagined foes and set up additional U.S. bases around the world. Using 9-11 as justification, these policies are being implemented today by the Bush administration.

 

<p>Yet maybe taking a stand for reconciliation over warfare is an essential part of our passage from the dominant cultural paradigm to one of greater compassion and love. Maybe to create this new way of being, we must confront the dark side of our culture. Maybe we must learn to love those whose ways we disdain. Maybe through doing so, we model the new way of being, demonstrating that we are all one, that we’re all in this together—including Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, et al. And by living our lives this way, we are already engaged in an emerging culture that focuses on our similarities rather than our differences, connection rather than division, love rather than hate. By choosing this course we uncouple ourselves from the actions of those who would lead us astray. We cease reacting to their transgressions and thus remove ourselves from their control. We live our lives congruent with our deepest values and intentions regardless of what politicians, the mass media or corporate PR flacks endeavor to foist upon us.

 

<p>Yet do not assume that I oppose direct action. For I do not mean that we should not take a stand against the slaughter of innocent men, women and children. I do not mean that we should not work to feed the hungry and house the poor. I do not mean that we should not cease the activities that foul our planet. I do not mean that we should not elect true public servants who have the interests of all of us at heart.

 

<p>I do mean, however, that we each have the personal responsibility to stop blaming others and bring forth the world we envision. I do mean that we can find much to be thankful for if we’re willing to awaken to it. I do mean that we can create the lives we were truly meant to live whenever we choose to do so. I do mean that we are blessed, and we are blessings . . . when we’re conscious of it and even when we’re not.
