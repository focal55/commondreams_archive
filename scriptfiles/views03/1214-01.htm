<p>WASHINGTON - </b>
							U.S. President George W. Bush celebrated a second 
victory in Iraq here Sunday with confirmation that 
occupation forces had captured fugitive former 
president Saddam Hussein on Saturday evening at a 
farmhouse outside Tikrit. 
<p>
But even the normally cocky U.S. commander-in-chief, 
who addressed the nation by television from the White 
House, stressed that the former Iraqi dictator's arrest 
will not mean a quick end to the occupation's armed 
resistance.
<p>
”The capture of Saddam Hussein does not mean the 
end of violence in Iraq,” Bush declared solemnly at the 
conclusion of a short statement that described 
Saddam's detention as ”crucial to the rise of a free 
Iraq”. 
<p>
Bush's resignation to more resistance reflected much 
of the reaction to the day's news, as lawmakers and 
analysts described the capture as a potentially major 
breakthrough that would not necessarily, however, 
prove decisive. 
<p>
Indeed, some specialists warned even before Sunday's 
announcement that Saddam's death or detention would 
prove largely irrelevant to the difficult problems faced by 
U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, both because loyalty to 
Hussein -- or even to his Ba'ath Party -- had ceased to 
be a catalyst for the insurgency long before and 
because the complex internal political situation in Iraq 
has begun to fuel more tension and violence in any 
event. 
<p>
Some even suggested that Saddam's capture might 
actually create new problems for the occupation by 
empowering sectors in the country's Shi'a community to 
test the occupation and back up their demands for 
direct elections to a new Iraqi government with more 
militant tactics. 
<p>
”Now that it is perfectly clear that (Hussein) is finished,” 
noted Iraq specialist Juan Cole, who teaches history at 
the University of Michigan, ”the Shiites may be 
emboldened”. 
<p>
”Those (Shiites) who dislike U.S. policies or who are 
opposed to the idea of occupation no longer need be 
apprehensive that the U.S. will suddenly leave and 
allow Saddam to come back to power.” 
<p>
”They may therefore now gradually throw off their 
political timidity, and come out more forcefully into the 
streets when they disagree,” Cole wrote on <a href="http://www.juancole.com/" target="_new">his website</a> 
Sunday. 
<p>
Saddam, of course, had been target number one for 
U.S. invasion forces, who actually tried to kill him in two 
”decapitation” air strikes in the course of the war. U.S. 
commanders expressed great confidence that they 
were closing in on the former president after his two 
sons, Uday and Qsay, were killed in a four-hour 
shootout at a house where they were hiding in Mosul. 
<p>
But over the days and weeks that followed, the trail 
apparently went cold, although U.S. military officials told 
reporters consistently they believed Saddam had gone 
to ground somewhere around Tikrit. 
<p>
In the end, that proved to be correct; tipped off by Iraqi 
informants, U.S. commanders said they found him in 
what they described as a 2 x 2.5 m. ”spider hole” built 
under a farmhouse outside the city where Saddam 
grew up. 
<p>
The bearded fugitive reportedly offered no resistance to 
U.S. troops, and Iraqi political leaders who were taken 
to the scene Sunday described his attitude as defiant. 
Videotape taken by his U.S. captors showed him being 
examined by medics, possibly for head lice. 
<p>
Commanders said they did not broadcast his capture 
until they could determine positively through DNA 
testing that it was indeed the former dictator. 
<p>
Although military commanders have long insisted that 
resistance to the occupation was being carried out 
primarily by ”Saddam loyalists”, they had never 
ascribed to him any actual leadership role, apart from 
his status as a symbol, particularly for Ba'athists. 
<p>
That appeared to be borne out by the circumstances of 
his capture. Not only was Saddam bedraggled, he also 
lacked any apparent means of electronic or satellite 
communication, such as a telephone, with his 
supporters. 
<p>
That was noted by some observers, who said it proved 
the resistance was clearly operating independently of 
Saddam. ”Given the location and circumstances of his 
capture, it makes clear that Saddam was not managing 
the insurgency, and that he had very little control or 
influence,” said Senator Jay Rockefeller, the 
Democratic leader on the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. 
<p>
”That is significant and disturbing because it means 
the insurgents are not fighting for Saddam; they're 
fighting against the United States,” he added. 
<p>
Other argued that, regardless of Saddam's relevance to 
resistance operations, his capture was bound to have a 
demoralizing effect on the insurgents, particularly 
members of the Ba'ath. 
<p>
Michael O'Hanlon, a military specialist at the Brookings 
Institution, told National Public Radio (NPR) the 
psychological impact of the capture was a ”devastating 
blow to (Saddam's) supporters”. 
<p>
That impact could be more significant on anti-Saddam 
sectors in Iraq, according to observers, although they 
failed to agree on whether it would, on balance, favor 
the occupation. 
<p>
”I think Saddam's capture will give Iraqis the courage 
and the psychological boost not to tolerate any more 
(Saddam loyalists or criminals) within their own 
society,” Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist at the 
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), told IPS. 
<p>
At the same time she also stressed that it will not 
”solve the problem of the insurgency, of the political 
chaos or of the reconstruction”. 
<p>
Retired Gen William Nash, also of CFR, told NPR the 
capture could lead many Iraqis in the so-called Sunni 
Triangle to cooperate more with occupation authorities. 
With the achievement of such a key objective, 
”everybody (will) want to get on the bandwagon”, he 
said. 
<p>
That might be overly optimistic, according to others -- 
including Cole, who wrote Sunday that Saddam ”was 
probably already irrelevant”. 
<p>
”The Sunni Arab resisters to U.S. occupation in the 
country's heartland had long since jettisoned Saddam 
and the Ba'ath as symbols,” he stressed. 
<p>
”They are fighting for local reasons. Some are Sunni 
fundamentalists, who despised the Ba'ath. Others are 
Arab nationalists who weep at the idea of their country 
being occupied. Some had relatives killed or humiliated 
by U.S. troops and are pursuing a clan vendetta. Some 
fear a Shiite and Kurdish-dominated Iraq will reduce 
them to second-class citizens.” 
<p>
Both this thesis, as well as the administration's 
continued insistence that the insurgency consists 
mainly of Saddam and Ba'ath loyalists, criminals, and 
foreign ”jihadis”, will be tested in the coming weeks 
and months.
