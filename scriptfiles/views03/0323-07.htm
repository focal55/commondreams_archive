<p>GEORGE Bush has made great play of the "coalition of the willing" - 30 countries who support his war on Iraq.</p> <p>But who are they and what are their real motives? The Daily Mirror put Bush's allies under the microscope and found a coalition of the bribed, bullied - or those simply blind to the truth. It contains some of the poorest, newest and smallest countries on the planet.</p> <p>This show of support has been stitched together by bullies in Washington dangling massive bribes in front of countries which depend on financial support from other nations.</p> <p>And the desperate attempt by the US to make its present coalition resemble the alliance of 34 nations which contributed tens thousands of troops in the last Gulf War in 1991 is unraveling. Afghanistan</p> <p>BRIBED</p> <p>Depends heavily on military assistance from the US. Its country is torn apart by tribal warlords. Aid from Britain and America is vital for restructuring the ravaged land.</p> <p>Albania</p> <p>BRIBED Incredibly poor country with refugee crisis following the Kosovo war. Depends heavily on Western aid.</p> <p>Australia</p> <p>BLIND Tony Blair used the country to announce for the first time his intention to topple Saddam Hussein in March 2002. Aussie PM John Howard, right, has been one of Britain's closest allies.</p> <p>Has sent a 2,000-strong force of SAS troops, fighter jets and warships to the Gulf. But more than two thirds of Australians oppose involvement in any war without UN approval.</p> <p>Azerbaijan/Georgia</p> <p>BLIND and BRIBED</p> <p>President Ferenc Madl, left, has allowed the Iraqi opposition to train on its territory. Hungary is also involved in massive oil deals with the US. It is part of a new wave of countries joining the EU in 2004 and its relations with the West are vital for that course to be completed.</p> <p>BRIBED Desperate for aid, trade with the West and cash for the war on terror.</p> <p>BRIBED Desperately needs to develop trade links with Britain and America. Has sent non-combat troops specializing in chemical warfare decontamination in response to US request. Poised to join the EU next year and must keep relations with Britain tight.</p> 

<p>Czech Republic</p> <p>BULLIED The Danish government is sending a corvette and a submarine, - but dropped plans to deploy ground troops because of weak parliamentary support.</p> <p>BRIBED</p> <p>Colombia, El Salvador and Nicaragua all receive generous anti-drugs funding from the US.</p> <p>Denmark Colombia/C America</p> <p>BRIBED</p> <p>These are two of the poorest, most war-torn countries in the world. The bitter rivals each want US backing in a boundary dispute and need US aid to fight a massive famine.</p> <p>Eritrea/Ethiopia Hungary</p> <p>BLIND One of the 12 original members of Nato's Security Council. Fully supports military action, despite massive protests from within the country.</p> <p>Iceland</p> <p>Italy</p> <p>BLIND The country's right-wing government, led by Silvio Berlusconi, right, has been behind Britain and America every step of the way. But the Vatican said it was deeply pained by the outbreak of war and deplored the interruption of efforts to bring about peace.</p> <p>Italy has offered logistical help and use of military bases and ports under long-standing Nato commitments.</p> <p>BLIND Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has given his moral backing for Washington.</p> <p>Japan South Korea</p> <p>BRIBED Has depended heavily on the Yankee dollar for the massive restructuring of its infrastructure.</p> <p>But even more important than that, it needs American muscle as protection against its nuclear-capable neighbors in the North. President Roh Moo-hyun admitted fearing that war with Iraq could hit relations between North Korea and the West.</p> 

<p>Baltic states</p> <p>BRIBED The crumbling economies of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are desperate for funding from Britain and America through the United Nations.</p> <p>Philippines</p> <p>BRIBED President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, right, said Manila gave political and moral support, adding: "We are part of the coalition of the willing."</p> <p>But the country depends on America for military support and muscle to fight terrorism.</p> <p>Poland</p> <p>BRIBED President Aleksander Kwasniewski, left, agreed to deploy up to 200 troops in the Gulf region, to perform non-combat roles supporting any US-led offensive.</p> <p>He also signed an open letter in support of the US. There's a reason he loves America - Poland is the first former communist state to join Nato and is among the 10 countries which have qualified to join the European Union in 2004.</p> <p>Macedonia</p> <p>BRIBED Did not exist at the time of the last Gulf War and is among the world's smallest nations. Needs friends such as Britain and America as well as more funding for its depressed economy and services.</p> <p>Netherlands</p> <p>BLIND The Dutch have sent anti-missile batteries to Turkey.</p> <p>Spain</p> <p>BLIND The strongest ally of the US and Britain. Has promised the use of its Nato bases for a strike on Iraq. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, right, appeared side-by-side with Blair and Bush at the Azores summit last week.</p> <p>Romania</p> <p>BRIBED Has offered a small military contingent, but it is unlikely to see any action. Romania is desperate for its support to be repaid with increased trade with Britain and American - as well as continued aid.</p> <p>Turkey</p> <p>BULLIED and BRIBED Has reluctantly pledged support but President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, left, criticized the US attack, saying the UN Security Council process on Iraq should have been allowed to finish. Washington abruptly withdrew its carrot of a £10billion aid package to Turkey after the pro-Islamic government frustrated the US's military build up.</p> 

<p>Slovakia</p> <p>BRIBED A leading member of the countries which are using this process to boost their own standing, Slovakia has offered troops on a non-combatant basis but expects financial rewards in return.</p> <p>United Kingdom</p> <p>BLIND Washington's chief ally, committing 45,000 military personnel, planes and warships. Uzbekistan</p> <p>BRIBED Receives assistance from the US for fighting drugs and terror.</p> <p>Silent Partners</p> <p>SAUDI Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman have refused to associate themselves publicly with the coalition.</p> <p>Israel has publicly supported the war, but America does not want it linked to the coalition.</p>
