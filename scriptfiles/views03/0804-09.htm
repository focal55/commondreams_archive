<p>CONGERS, N.Y. — The Al Laghetto Restaurant on Route 9W is a well-regarded family operation that until recently was run by Elizabeta Markvukaj, her fiancé, Vaso Nikpreljevic, and his brother Mario.

<p>Ms. Markvukaj is a friendly, formidable woman from Albania who carries with her the disturbing memories of her years in a Communist internment camp. Vaso, Mario and other members of the close-knit Nikpreljevic clan settled in the U.S. after fleeing Montenegro in the 1990's.

<p>After the violence, hatreds and atrocities they witnessed in their homelands, these refugees had managed to knit together a life in quiet upstate Rockland County that seemed very good indeed. Elizabeta and Vaso had a baby girl 18 months ago and were making plans for their wedding. They belonged to a local church, paid their taxes promptly, contributed to charity and participated in Sept. 11 relief efforts.

<p>It's hard to imagine a family that is less of a threat to the peace and well-being of the United States. And yet everything the family has worked toward is unraveling.

<p>On Nov. 30, 2002, Mr. Nikpreljevic was pulled over for speeding on the Connecticut Turnpike. A computer check revealed that his immigration papers were not in order. A nightmare scenario ensued. He was handcuffed and arrested, and has not been out of custody since. The government has ordered him deported. And under current law he would be barred from any realistic chance of returning.

<p>"He hasn't done anything wrong," said Ms. Markvukaj. Tears streamed down her face during an interview on a large, covered patio behind the restaurant. She described how she took the baby, Nina, to visit Vaso in prison ("She recognized him!"), how business has fallen off in the restaurant and how the family is fighting with everything it has to block Vaso's deportation.

<p>Mr. Nikpreljevic's immigration history is complicated. His lawyers, Theodore Cox and Joshua Bardavid, said that back in the early-90's when he first came to the U.S., Mr. Nikpreljevic's mother submitted a petition on his behalf requesting authorization to apply for a green card. That petition was approved. But Mr. Nikpreljevic submitted a request for asylum. That was denied and he was deported.

<p>He returned to the U.S. illegally, through Canada. But, according to the lawyers, he paid a $1,000 penalty and was permitted to apply for a green card and remain in the U.S. pending a decision on his application.

<p>As he had never been in trouble, and his relatives and fiancée had all been able to secure citizenship or permanent residency status, he did not anticipate a problem.

<p>But times (and the treatment of immigrants) have changed since Sept. 11. After his arrest in Connecticut, Mr. Nikpreljevic was told that his application had been "terminated." No reason was given, his lawyers said. Mr. Nikpreljevic has been held in a number of prisons in Connecticut and Massachusetts since then, the latest being the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers, Conn.

<p>When he is being moved from one prison to another, his family said, officials just show up in the middle of the night and take him away — a very frightening procedure. Thousands of men and women, many of them completely innocent, are ensnared in this system, which is fundamentally uncaring and frequently cruel. Many of the immigrants never even see an attorney. 

<p>In Mr. Nikpreljevic's case, the lawyers have challenged the decision by immigration authorities to "terminate" his application for permanent residency status. If their effort is unsuccessful he will be deported, and there is little doubt his family will be devastated.

<p>Mr. Nikpreljevic and his relatives are exactly the kinds of productive individuals who help a society to thrive. They have been a boon to their local community and are assets to the U.S. as a whole. But the law, especially in times of great fear, does not always leave room for wise decisions. And where immigrants are concerned, the system becomes more of a crapshoot than ever.


<p>So the extended family that is anchored by the Al Laghetto Restaurant is holding its collective breath, hoping for a merciful ruling from the courts.

<p>The speeding charge, by the way, was dismissed.
