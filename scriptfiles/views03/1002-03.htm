<p>There's an old saying that you should never let a fox guard the 
henhouse. The same could be said of the investigation into the latest 
White House scandal. Attorney General John Ashcroft is refusing to 
appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate who in the 
administration leaked the name of a CIA operative to journalists. This 
despite the fact that Ashcroft has long-standing ties to one of the main 
suspects: President Bush's top political advisor Karl Rove.

<p>"I think it's very difficult on its surface for John Ashcroft to be 
taken seriously as an investigator," said James Moore, author of 'Bush's 
Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential', in an interview 
with Democracy Now!. "In this case, there is a close relationship 
between someone who is a high profile suspect and the individual who is 
leading the investigation of him. And it immediately goes to the 
question of credibility and validity of that particular investigation."

<p>Rove has been accused of leaking the identity of CIA operative Valerie 
Plame, in retaliation for her husband, veteran diplomat Joseph Wilson, 

blowing the whistle on the Bush administration's charge that Saddam 
Hussein attempted to import uranium for nuclear weapons from Niger.

<p>Rove is best known as the driving force behind Bush's taking of the 
presidency, but he also worked for Ashcroft over the course of two decades.

<p>"It goes all the way back to the mid 1980's when John Ashcroft first ran 
for governor and then when he ran for the United States Senate against 
Mel Carnahan," says Moore. "Karl was so intimately involved."

<p>Not only did Rove work for Ashcroft in the 80s, but he was one of the 
main forces behind Ashcroft's controversial appointment to the job he 
currently holds, attorney general. Rove lobbied intensely for his former 
employer's nomination after Ashcroft lost his senate seat to a dead man, 
the late Mel Carnahan.

<p>While Ashcroft was not Bush's first choice for attorney general, Rove 
reportedly told Bush that spilling some blood over the nomination of the 
fiercely right-wing Ashcroft was "a no-lose proposition."

<p>Just as George W. Bush profited handsomely from the building of a 
stadium for his Texas Rangers baseball team, Karl Rove cashed in from 
the successful campaign in St. Louis to get a stadium built. The 
governor who signed the legislation?

<p>John Ashcroft.

<p>Now attorney general, Ashcroft is refusing to hand over the reigns of 
the criminal investigation of his political ally, former employee and 
longtime advisor, Karl Rove.

<p>For the past several days, the White House has been besieged with 
questions on the "burning" of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Scott 
McClellan, the press secretary and other officials have offered only 
carefully worded and non-specific responses to reporters' questions as 
to who leaked the identity of Wilson's wife.

<p>"It is impossible for any of us to believe that this happened without 
Karl knowing about it," says author James Moore. "When you cross this 
man in the political arena, he gets even; and he gets even in a way that 
he doesn't just defeat you, he is compelled to destroy you. He doesn't 
know how to do a measured response when he is angry, and so he leaks 
information about people that destroys them."

<p>According to the latest Washington Post-ABC poll, 69% of Americans 
believe there should be a special counsel independent of the 
administration investigating the White House leak. Yet, in his only news 
conference to date on the issue, Ashcroft stood firm that his office 
will oversee the investigation. "The prosecutors and agents who are and 
will be handling this investigation are career professionals with 
extensive experience in handling matters involving sensitive national 
security information and with experience relating to investigations of 
unauthorized disclosures of such information."

<p>At the Justice Department news conference, a reporter attempted to 
question Ashcroft further, "Can you at least say what assurances you can 
give people that the matter will be handled independently without... "

<p>Ashcroft interrupted, "Are there other questions today?"

<p>Yes there are. But an independent counsel should be asking them.
