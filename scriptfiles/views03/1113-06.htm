<p>As another Veteran's Day passes by, George W. Bush has sent a clear and 
present message to the men and women of America's armed forces:  Drop Dead. 
<p>
In an astonishing series of cynical attacks on veterans rights, benefits and 
sanctity, the administration has shortchanged our military personnel on their 
medical care, pensions, compensation for having been tortured, access to vital 
information about health dangers suffered in service, and even their body 
armor.    
<p>
After promising that the Iraqi people would be "dancing in the streets" upon 
their arrival, US troops are being attacked up to three dozen times a day.  In 
response,  Bush has imposed an unprecedented media blackout on coverage of 
their corpses coming home.<p>
Bush himself has yet to attend the funeral of any soldier slain in Iraq.  But 
he has attacked those within the military who would express a democratic 
opinion against his policies. 
<p>
Bush has also violated a crucial national tradition---dating to George 
Washington---against a Chief Executive appearing in military garb while in civilian 
office. 
<p>
Bush himself went AWOL from his Alabama National Guard unit during the 
Vietnam War.  His lengthy absence may have made him technically a deserter, and thus 
subject to prosecution, which has never happened. 
<p>
Earlier this year Bush was flown by military jet onto the aircraft carrier 
Abraham Lincoln.  Strutting on the flight deck in a photo op jump flight suit, 
he spoke before a "Mission Accomplished" banner which he now denies was rigged 
by his handlers.  Bush has publicly cited his alleged "combat" experience, but 
never served in any battle.  He showed his tactical genius by daring the 
Iraqi resistance to "bring it on,"  followed by the deaths of scores of soldiers 
and civilians.  
<p>
Three supreme US generals who did serve in wartime---Washington, Ulysses S. 
Grant and Dwight Eisenhower---have also served as US president.  To emphasize 
the crucial separation of the military from American civilian government, all 
made a point of avoiding public appearances in military uniform while in 
office.  So have other veteran presidents such as John F. Kennedy and Bush's father, 
George H.W. Bush.  
<p>
But George W. Bush soiled that tradition with a Tom Cruise routine that cost 
taxpayers at least $800,000, and may have deprived the crew of the U.S.S. 
Lincoln of a day's leave. 
<p>
This Veteran's Day, Bush signed the Fallen Patriots Tax Relief Act, which 
doubles the tax-free death gratuity payment given to the families of fallen 
soldiers from $6,000 to $12,000.  He also approved the National Cemetery Expansion 
Act to help establish new military burial grounds. 
<p>
But he has now frozen $1 billion in financial settlements won by 17 U.S. 
combat veterans who were whipped, beaten, burned, electrically shocked and starved 
by Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The vets and their 
families filed for compensation under a 1996 law, citing the Geneva Convention.<p>
On July 7, U.S. District Judge Richard Roberts ordered Iraq to pay the 17 
ex-POWs and their families $653 million in compensatory damages, plus another 
$306 million in punitive damages. But Bush has cited "weighty foreign policy 
interests" and has sued to withhold the money. <p>
Meanwhile Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has blatantly violated a 1990s 
law requiring the military to keep baseline medical data so the health of the 
US soldiers now serving in Iraq can be properly monitored.  The demand 
derives from Gulf War Syndrome, which may have caused disabling diseases among as 
many as 220,000 vets.  But Rumsfeld has ignored the law.  
<p>
The Administration is also denying service women access to reproductive care, 
including abortions.  And it has failed to provide body armor to some forty 
percent of the soldiers serving in Iraq.   
<p>
Meanwhile Bush has fought to slash long-standing benefits due surviving 
veterans of the World Wars, Korea and Vietnam.  The GOP has opposed repealing the 
Disabled Veterans Tax, which mandated that money due some 600,000 surviving 
vets in disability pay be deducted, dollar-for-dollar.  At one point Rumsfeld 
told the White House to veto the Defense Appropriations Bill if it gave the vets 
that money. 
<p>
A firestorm of outrage has forced the administration into a compromise phased 
in over ten years.  But it will still deny thousands of veterans their 
benefits as they die off.  
<p>
With the relentless militarization of the mainstream media, Bush clearly 
believes he can ignore the soldiers he will condemn to death, disease and abject 
poverty.<p>
Especially now that he has announced his courageous support for more 
cemeteries in which to bury their unphotographed corpses.
