<p>What do Saddam Hussein and "Bachelor Bob" have in common? 

<P>One's a torturer, a killer of millions (if you count those killed in his U.S.-backed war with Iran) and the other is just a creepy reality TV guy who "got" what he could from each of his prospective "bachelorettes." But each has been presented to celebrity-drunk Americans as more important than he is. 

<P>Saddam, in the wake of his ignominious capture last week, has been foisted upon us as vindication of the Bush administration's still-troubled Iraq policy. It's good he's accounted for, but I've long felt that Bush's overfocus on Saddam was a mistake; mostly, it gave the administration a convenient way to personify its war of choice. 

<P>Trying Saddam will be cathartic for Iraqis, and I believe they should mete out justice according to their own notions. But I doubt the dictator's capture is going to change much. 

<P>Saddam, disheveled and cowering in a hole, is a useful as p.r. But to his credit, even President Bush cautioned that his capture won't make Iraqis less hostile to American occupation. It's clear now that "Skid Row" Saddam was already defanged (the one clear-cut benefit of the war). 

<P>Ah, but if it's not Bachelor Bob, it's the Butcher of Baghdad. And overreliance on personalities to support policies ("Osama, dead or alive") often backfires. Remove all the "evildoers" you like, but if you dismiss as meaningless the roots of their anger, you're just wasting ammo. There will <I>always</I> be people who want to take the world's superpower down a notch, especially if it's bent on permanent domination. 

<P>Americans who (weirdly) feel personal pride at Saddam's capture are furious at "traitorous" suggestions that his bagging was somehow timed for political purposes. But even if nobody was saving Saddam for a time when the president's poll numbers were shaky and a real Democratic front-runner had finally emerged, does anyone doubt that the primary value of Saddam-in-a-box is political? The Bush administration is adept at symbolism, and "dental-exam Saddam" (think there'll be a doll?) is going to come in mighty handy in 2004. 

<P>But let's recall that while "regime change" was once the <I>casus belli</I> of the day, by the time the bombs started falling, it was all about saving the world from weapons of mass destruction and disrupting terrorist ties &#151; neither of which seem to have existed. And, sorry to burst any noble bubbles, but Saddam was "our S.O.B." while committing some of his most heinous deeds, such as the gassing of Kurds. 

<P>So if the White House is going to use Saddam's capture for political gain, and I oppose Bush &#151; not because I "hate" him, but because I don't like what he's doing to the economy, the environment, world cooperation, etc. &#151; why should I go giddy over this mostly symbolic development? 

<P>It's possible that the Bush agenda &#151; dismantling the social support system, rabid exploitation of natural resources, messianic notions of power, favoring corporations and the rich, pursuing perpetual "superpower" status &#151; may bring us a better world. Maybe I'm just too dimwitted to see it. 

<P>But for now, I <I>don't</I> see it. And the capture of a Saddam &#151; good, but it won't make Americans safer &#151; could make it more likely that I will live in that future. So yes, my feelings are equivocal. 

<P>Call me mush-headed, "Bush hater," traitor, or crassly political for failing to show sufficient enthusiasm for Saddam's capture. But don't presume to tell me how I should feel.</p>
