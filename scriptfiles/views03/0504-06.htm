<p><i>Q: There were four injured soldiers just this past weekend when a little girl handed over a canister-sized piece of a cluster bomb, an M-42.
 
</i>
<p><i>[General Richard] Myers: Yeah, what I -- the story we got on what the little girl handed over -- and it was -- was an improvised explosive device to do harm to the four soldiers. It wasn't trying to return a piece of ordnance, in fact.
 
</i>
<p><i>Q: From a seven-year-old girl?
 
</i>
<p><i>Myers: Exactly. Exactly. Then she tried to run away after she handed it, and it went off.</i> ...
                 from a transcript of a Pentagon news briefing, 4/21/03.
 

<p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, an ambitious governor said on Friday he would use "whatever force necessary" to put down anti-war protests in a nearby college town.  That night the protests grew worse, with bonfires and window-breaking and accusations of  communist plots and police brutality flying back and forth.  Saturday night the protestors set fire to an old frame building on campus, and the governor, believing that communists were taking over, called out the army.  Sunday the situation deteriorated, with the anti-war protesters cursing and throwing rocks at the soldiers, the governor calling students "worse than Communists" and the guardsmen using tear-gas and bayonets to break up the crowd.  Still, most believed the situation was under control and the protests would diminish when classes started on Monday.
 
<p>Monday noon the soldiers inexplicably fired into the crowd of protestors and lunch-bound students, killing four and wounding nine.  The authorities closed down the college and forced the students to leave.  A local newspaper reported that a number of soldiers had been killed and that armed and dangerous rebels were still at large.  A strict curfew was imposed, enforced by armed men and helicopters. 
 
<p>A few days later inspectors searched the student residences for deadly weapons, finding an assortment of steak-knives, starting-pistols, cap-guns, ceremonial swords, fencing foils, and antique firearms.  High officials publicly deplored student violence that "invites tragedy".  Many townspeople justified the shootings, calling the students "scuzzballs" and asserting that the soldiers "should have killed more of them."  It was rumored that the protesters were controlled by communists hiding in a Soviet submarine in a local (landlocked) reservoir.  Other stories circulated that the dead students were "covered with lice" or "eaten up by venereal disease and would have died in a few days anyway." 
 
<p align="center">* * *
<p>That's my story, with this personal note: On Monday, May 4, 1970, I took my five-year-old daughter to work with me instead of to her kindergarten class at the Kent State University  School.  I wasn't concerned about the student protesters, who shouted a lot and set some fires in the middle of the night, but I was worried about soldiers with rifles on campus.  In the following days I tried to explain to her what had happened in terms she could understand, and in ways that wouldn't leave her fearful and distrusting of either students or soldiers.  
 
<p>Thirty-three years later I don't know why the soldiers opened fire.  No guardsman ever claimed he was "just following orders".  No officer ever stepped forward and said -- with either pride or shame -- "I gave the order to fire, by my authority, according to such-and-such a protocol."  
 
<p>Name-calling,  rumors and divisive stories still circulate around Kent.  A lot of energy is still invested in stories intended to make either the students or the guardsmen into Good Guys like the storyteller -- reasonable, virtuous, and humane, or stories to prove that "those people" --either the soldiers or the students --  were evil, depraved, inhuman Bad Guys.
 
<p>And in 2003, after an unprovoked attack by the U.S. on small and unruly but essentially unarmed country, our entire nation is fragmented by name-calling,  rumors and divisive stories.  Like May 4 at Kent State, we have leaders convinced that "those people" had an arsenal of deadly weapons despite evidence to the contrary; and a belief by many people that violence was not only justified and necessary to restore order, it was the only possible option.
 
<p>Of course the Kent students weren't oppressed by a cruel dictator.  The attack on Iraq was not unplanned or unforeseen.  Throwing rocks is no longer considered sufficient provocation for shooting unarmed young people (except when the youth are poor or dark-skinned).  Today the Kent State protesters would be (and are) called terrorists, not communists.
 
<p>Also today we have name-calling, rumors and divisive stories managed by the Pentagon, and magnified by the media. 
 
<p>What do we make of General Myers' story about the seven-year-old girl?  It promptly divides us into: "Yes, there are people so evil they would send their seven-year-olds to be blown up if they thought it would kill Americans," and "No, people wouldn't do that."   And that division tends to propagate forever.
 
<p>Was the shooting at Kent State necessary?  The attack on Iraq?  What stories do we make, or choose, and teach our children?
 
<p>No submarine was ever found in West Branch Reservoir.
