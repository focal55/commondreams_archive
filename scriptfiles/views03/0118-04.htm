<p>One of the most important votes of 2003 will be cast not in Congress or

in voting booths across the country but at the Federal Communications

Commission. At stake is how TV, radio, newspapers and the Internet will

look in the next generation and beyond. At stake are core values of

localism, competition, diversity and maintaining the vitality of

America's marketplace of ideas. And at stake is the ability of consumers

to enjoy creative, diverse and enriching entertainment.</p>

<p>



But most people and most journalists are ignoring this momentous vote.

Last year FCC chair Michael Powell announced that the commission would

vote this spring on whether to scrap, modify or retain our media

concentration protections. These rules currently limit a single

corporation from dominating a local TV market; from merging a

community's TV stations and newspapers into one voice; from merging two

major TV networks; and from controlling more than 35 percent of TV

households in the nation. And now we are on the verge of dramatically

altering the nation's media landscape without the national debate that

this issue merits.</p>

<p>



What will happen if these rules disappear or are significantly loosened?

We have some history to guide us. The FCC eliminated many of its radio

consolidation rules in 1996. This action has already caused real

problems, according to numerous media experts. Conglomerates now own

hundreds of stations across the country. One company, Clear Channel,

owns more than 1,200. Today there are 30 percent fewer radio station

owners than there were before the commission abandoned its rules in

1996. Most local radio markets are oligopolies. More and more

programming originates outside local stations' studios--far from

listeners and their communities.</p>

<p>



Media watchers like the Media Access Project, the Center for Digital

Democracy and Consumers Union argue that this concentration has led to

far less coverage of news and public interest programming and less

localism. A study by the Future of Music Coalition strongly suggests

that consolidation has led to the homogenization of music. Many

observers say that radio now serves more to advertise the products of

vertically integrated conglomerates than to inform or entertain

Americans with the best and most original programming. In addition, the

work of the Parents Television Council shows that offensive and indecent

programming has grown more pervasive on radio. As programming decisions

are wrested from our local communities and made instead in distant

corporate headquarters, our children are exposed to more and more

offensive material.</p>

<p>



Despite this history, we are now about to decide whether to eliminate

the rules that govern the rest of the media world. If all these rules

are scrapped or if the FCC seriously weakens them, one company could

dominate a region's access to information by controlling its radio

stations, television stations, newspaper and cable system. And those who

believe the Internet will save us from this fate should realize that the

dominant Internet news sources are owned by the same media giants who

control radio, TV, newspapers and cable. The fate of cable television

and the emerging fate of the Internet should teach us that new

technology alone, without rules that protect against its being co-opted

by media giants, will not guarantee healthy, independent local media.</p>

<p>



Yet the FCC is charging ahead without adequately studying the vast

consequences of its actions. It has resisted calls to hold public

hearings. Only under pressure did it agree to hold one lone official

hearing in Richmond, Virginia. Most Americans don't even know that

momentous decisions are about to be made. It is the FCC's responsibility

to tell them and to solicit their thoughts. Failure to do so disserves

the public interest and makes it appear that the commission is trying to

eliminate concentration protections in the dark of night.</p>

<p>



But it is also the media's responsibility to bring this story to the

public. That hasn't happened yet. Indeed, some very important media

enterprises have financial interests riding on the outcome of the

ownership proceedings. The very institutions we rely on to be a forum

for this debate are the institutions most affected by its outcome. The

media are at pains to assure us their newsgathering operations are

independent of their corporate interests. Here is an opportunity to test

that claim.</p>

<p>



Suppose for a moment that the FCC votes to remove or significantly

modify the concentration protections. Suppose that turns out to be a

mistake. How would we ever put the genie back in the bottle? The answer

is that we could not. That's why we need a national dialogue on the

issue and better data and analysis. We need this debate in Congress, at

the commission, among concerned industries, in the media and all across

America. The future of the media, a key part of the infrastructure of

democracy, hangs in the balance.</p>
