                    the party's core constituencies at gatherings across the nation. 
                    Words like these, and the struggles they evoke, are the reasons

                    will never again be challenged in the United States. Acting 
                    as a Republican Trojan Horse in the bowels of the Democratic 
                    machinery, the DLC claims the &quot;real&quot; party lives

                    that minorities, unionists, environmentalists, feminists,

<p align="left"><font class="bc">The 
                    DLC is the corporate-funded right wing of the Democratic Party. 
                    It was founded in the mid 1980s by a small group of mostly 
                    white, male, largely southern Democratic politicians, corporate 
                    lobbyists and fundraisers. The original clique included Tennessee 
                    Congressman Al Gore, Senators Chuck Robb of Virginia and Sam 
                    Nunn of Georgia, and Al From, a former political operative 
                    from the Jimmy Carter Administration. To them, the Democratic 
                    Party had become too open to the political voices of African 
                    Americans and Latinos, too respectful of the rights of working 
                    Americans and the labor movement, too responsive to the justice, 
                    peace and environmental movements. &quot;The DLC thundered 
                    against the 'liberal fundamentalism' of the party's base - 
                    unionists, blacks, feminists, Greens, and cause groups generally,&quot; wrote Dreyfuss.</font></p>
<p align="left"><span class="bc">Most 
                    alarming of all, in their eyes, was the 1984 presidential 
                    campaign of Jesse Jackson, in which the black candidate received 
                    a percentage of the vote considerably higher than the proportion 
                    of black votes in several states, and sparked a significant 
                    expansion of the party's base constituencies among minorities, 
                    labor, and even some white rural voters. The Democratic Party 
                    was actually <i>growing</i> - but in the wrong direction to 
                    suit the &quot;rump faction&quot; centered in the white South.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="bc">Today, 
                    after almost two decades of DLC cash subversion and seduction 
                    of Democratic candidates and office holders, there is less 
                    difference than ever between Democrats and Republicans in 
                    state houses and legislatures, in City Halls or on the bench, 
                    in Congress or among the so-called &quot;serious&quot; candidates 
                    for president. Once again, actual and potential Democratic 
                    voters have been deterred from entering a political process 
                    that does not address their needs. For its next triumph, the 
                    DLC threatens to eviscerate or neutralize the very heart, 
                    soul and base of the Democratic Party - the Black Consensus.</span></p>

                    hustlers that founded the DLC noted that vast amounts of corporate 
                    money were flowing into the state and national bank accounts 
                    of the Reagan-era Republican Party. To qualify for a cut of 
                    that largesse for themselves they would have to hijack the 
                    Democratic Party and move it to the right, away from its Democratic 
                    voting base. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font class="bc">The 
                    clique's objectives were (a) to move the Democratic Party 
                    to the right in order to attract contributions from the oil 
                    and insurance industries, from Wall Street and military contractors 
                    and whoever else could write the big checks, and (b) to tailor 
                    the Democratic Party's pitch to attract upwardly mobile conservative 
                    white and suburban &quot;swing&quot; voters. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font class="bc">Bill 
                    Clinton, the ambitious young governor of Arkansas, was an 
                    early DLC star recruit, and Al Gore was its anointed presidential 
                    candidate in 1988. Super Tuesday, a multi-state mega-primary 
                    centered in the former Confederate states, was engineered 
                    by the DLC/New Democrats to be their first electoral coup. 
                    By concentrating the weight of the South, Super Tuesday was 
                    designed to preemptively narrow the range of choices available 
                    to Democratic voters nationwide early in the presidential 
                    nominee selection process. It was also deliberately intended 
                    to swing the advantage to the candidate who could spend big 
                    bucks on simultaneous media campaigns in several states. However, 
                    the strategy backfired when Jesse Jackson, on the strength 
                    of an unprecedented mobilization of the Democratic &quot;base&quot; vote, won the South Carolina primary outright.</font></p>
<p align="left"><span class="bc">Funded 
                    by an impressive array of corporate backers, the DLC/New Democrats 
                    founded their own think tank, the elegantly misnamed <a href="http://www.ppionline.org/" target="_new">Progressive 
                    Policy Institute</a>, and ground out reams of press releases, 
                    corporate-friendly position papers, consultant referrals, 
                    in-person and on-air advice to Democrats that they'd better 
                    become more like Republicans if they wanted to remain &quot;competitive&quot; - an invitation to make themselves fitting recipients for 
                    corporate bribes, a.k.a. big campaign contributions. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="bc">The 
                    insurgent DLC tinkered with the delegate selection process 
                    at Democratic conventions to frustrate the participation of 
                    grassroots party activists. They developed their rightist 
                    corporate message and they stayed on it. They built an impressive 
                    machine to boost each other's careers and publicize the alleged &quot;new ideas&quot; and &quot;innovative approaches&quot; of their star politicians. Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, 
                    Missouri Congressman Dick Gephardt and Bill Clinton all served 
                    as DLC chairs. Jimmy Carter was involved, as was every southern 
                    Democratic governor.</span></p>

<p align="left"><font class="bc">Clinton 
                    was the DLC/New Democrat candidate in 1992. Rather than answer 
                    the Reaganite myth of the welfare queen, Clinton pandered 
                    to it and gave us a &quot;welfare reform&quot; more punitive 
                    than anything Reagan-era Republicans could have wrested from 
                    the Congress. Following the advice of his DLC advisors to 
                    not appear too close to his party's base - which had 
                    nowhere else to go, anyway - New Democrat Clinton took a couple 
                    days off during the campaign to fly back to Arkansas and pull 
                    the switch on a mentally impaired black convict, and attended 
                    an Operation PUSH event specifically to upbraid young black 
                    activist Sista Souljah. Once in office, it was Bill Clinton's 
                    DLC advisors who prevailed upon him to make passing NAFTA 
                    his first priority rather than working to fulfill his campaign 
                    promise to make medical care available to everyone. So it 
                    was that during his first two years as president, the only 
                    years during which Democrats controlled the Congress, Bill 
                    Clinton called in all his chips to get DLC/New Democrats in 
                    Congress to vote against the majority of their party caucus 
                    and join with the Republican minority to pass NAFTA, directly 
                    causing the loss of millions of US jobs to low-wage labor 
                    markets elsewhere in the hemisphere. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font class="bc">By 
                    2000 the DLC/New Democrats were firmly in control of the Democratic 
                    convention, as well as the process of selecting delegates 
                    and the party's nominees - their old retread from the 80s, 
                    Al Gore, and a piously pandering senator and former DLC chairman 
                    from Connecticut, Joe Lieberman. DLC/New Democrats at the 
                    convention used any means necessary to shut down the &quot;national 
                    conversation&quot; that hundreds of grassroots delegates wanted 
                    to take up. John Nichols provided a valuable account in the 
                    September 2000 issue of The Progressive, &quot;<a href="http://www.progressive.org/nich1000.htm" target="_new">Behind

                    Trojan Horse&quot; to describe the stealth candidacy of one 
                    Cory Booker for mayor of Newark, New Jersey. The Booker campaign 
                    was a joint project of the DLC and the most right-wing foundations

                    of Booker's far-right associations caused him to lose his 
                    bid to plant the school vouchers flag in a major black city, 
                    the DLC continues to bestow its corporate seal of approval 
                    on a steady trickle of black officeholders and candidates.

<p align="left" class="bc"><font class="bc">For 
                    the Right, bankrolling black Trojan Horses who can masquerade 
                    as Democrats while pushing positions well to the right of 
                    most other African Americans and the rest of the Democratic 
                    party's base has distinct advantages over feeding and watering 
                    the old stable of token black Republicans like former Congressman 
                    J.C. Watts. Black Republicans are rarely electable to significant 
                    office outside overwhelmingly white constituencies, making 
                    it difficult for the Right to maintain the pretense that these 
                    craven stooges represent black public opinion, or anything 
                    beyond their own career ambitions. It should come as no surprise 
                    that black Republicans are a hard sell among black voters, 
                    since a large part of their credentials consists of ostentatious 
                    display of &quot;courageous independence&quot; from and opposition 
                    to the views of the vast majority of the African American

<p align="left"><font class="bc">By 
                    contrast, the employment of black Trojan horse Democrats opens 
                    up new opportunities for the Right. It is in fact cheaper 
                    and easier for the corporate Right to flip an incumbent black 
                    Democratic city councilman, state legislator or congressman 
                    than it is to bring up stooges through its own farm system. 
                    Given the choice, the Right would rather buy a black, than 
                    groom one.</font></p>

                    some of them old faces transformed by new infusions of capital. 
                    An ominous and confusing period is upon us as these newly 
                    minted or recently transformed black elected spokespeople 
                    are trotted out by the corporate media as evidence that the 
                    Black Consensus no longer exists, that African Americans have 
                    shed our &quot;outmoded&quot; habit of groupthink everywhere 
                    that it differs from the purported White Consensus.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font class="bc">For 
                    more than two generations the vast majority of African Americans 
                    have cast ballots for Democrats, comprising that party's most 
                    loyal constituency. The black bloc vote phenomenon is the 
                    electoral expression of what we call the Black Consensus, 
                    in which African Americans support in overwhelming numbers 
                    whichever candidate they perceive to be closest to their commonly 
                    held views on public education, full employment, war and peace,

                    American Democratic (and if you go back far enough, Republican) 
                    operatives and politicians. More importantly, black bloc voting 
                    is the only factor that keeps the legitimate demands of African

                    than empowers black communities. Each election cycle, they 
                    wistfully predict that black bloc voting is about to end. 
                    Soon a new crop of corporate funded black candidates and elected 
                    officials, many originally elevated to office on the strength 
                    of the Black Consensus itself, will be available to tell white

                    committing the US to a course of nuclear nonproliferation. 
                    Aside from a reference to anti-profiling measures, there is 
                    little that addresses the needs of working Americans, of minorities,

                    bad campaign advice to African American and other candidates 
                    and officeholders, and expensive consultants to dispense it. 
                    Although the electorate as a percentage of eligible voters 
                    has been shrinking for decades, the enlightened wisdom of 
                    DLC operatives, which has become the conventional wisdom of 
                    Democratic political consultants, is not to bother enlarging 
                    the pool of eligible and interested voters. DLC advisors counsel 
                    clients to run to the &quot;center,&quot; a target that is 
                    itself constantly shifting rightward, to tailor their appeal 
                    to an ever-smaller group of Republican-leaning swing voters, 
                    and to do it with large expenditures on big media and direct 
                    mail to targeted constituencies. A couple of 2002's DLC non-success 
                    stories include Ron Kirk of Texas among black candidates, 
                    and Roy Barnes, the former governor of Georgia - another rising 
                    DLC star until he lost last year despite outspending his Republican 
                    rival about five to one. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font class="bc">What 
                    African American politicians and candidates do get from DLC 
                    affiliation is &quot;access&quot; - access to the money they 
                    need to pay for the bad advice. Access to money to pay for 
                    TV time. Access to the funding to retire old campaign debts 
                    and be re-elected. Before the days of the DLC it was said 
                    that corporate interests gave politicians money so they could 
                    get &quot;access&quot; to powerful politicians. But the DLC/New 
                    Democrats have effectively subordinated the crafting of public 
                    policy to the quest for campaign contributions. The old relationship 
                    has been reversed. Black politicians seek campaign donations 
                    to be viable candidates, and are thus &quot;free&quot; to 
                    adjust their stands on issues in the direction that keeps 
                    those contributions flowing. The DLC and its corporations 
                    have purchased the political discourse.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font class="bc">So 
                    it is that this mother of all political Trojan Horses, the 
                    DLC, has seized institutional control of the Democratic Party 
                    and will not be dislodged easily, if at all. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font class="bc">One 
                    saving grace remains. Although corporations can buy politicians 
                    by the bushel, they cannot vote. The logical answer to corporate 
                    dominance of the electoral process then, is to remove corporate 
                    money. Real campaign finance reform would outlaw contributions 
                    from corporations and big donations of wealthy individuals. 
                    Once corporations are deprived of the ability to bribe politicians, 
                    the Democratic Party will belong to its base among Democratic 
                    voters. There are formidable barriers to reform of this kind, 
                    including Supreme Court decisions that very nearly equate 
                    corporate bribes to politicians with First Amendment-protected &quot;free speech.&quot; Campaign finance reforms must also 
                    be legislated upon by the very state and federal lawmakers 
                    elected under the current system. As Rep. Jesse L. Jackson 
                    Jr. (D-Chicago) put it:</font></p>
<div align="left"> 
                    
<blockquote><i><font class="bc">The 
                      American people recognize that money - unregulated and even 
                      regulated money - presently keeps our House, our Senate, 
                      and our Presidency from creating an equal, high-quality 
                      education for our children, or from providing all Americans 
                      with equal, high-quality health care. The American people 
                      believe campaign money prevents them from having a clean, 
                      safe, and sustainable environment. Instead of real reform, 
                      we get politicians - Democrats and Republicans - voting 
                      to raise the limits on campaign contributions to &quot;adjust 
                      for inflation.&quot; I just don't know many people in the 
                      Second District of Illinois who are clamoring to be able 
                      to give $3,000 each election cycle to their Congressman. 
                      I think they are more interested in adjusting the minimum 
                      wage upward - but Congress isn't debating that.</font></i></blockquote>

<p align="left" class="bc"><font class="bc">And 
                    what if corporate money cannot be removed from the process 
                    any time soon? The time may be near when the Black Consensus 
                    and other parts of the Democratic Party's historic legacy 
                    will have to find temporary or permanent homes elsewhere. 
                    In 1948 the Progressive Party presidential campaign of Henry 
                    Wallace, in which Paul Robeson played an important part, posed 
                    a significant enough threat to Democrat Harry Truman's chances 
                    that he was forced to move to the left to keep that Democratic 
                    base largely intact. This was why in the weeks before the 
                    election Truman found the spine to veto the infamously anti-labor 
                    Taft-Hartley bill and desegregate the armed forces by presidential 
                    decree. Without a high-profile Progressive Party presidential 
                    campaign in 1948 the US armed forces might not have begun 
                    desegregation until the mid-1950s or later. Though legal barriers 
                    to ballot access are higher than two generations ago, and 
                    access to coverage in the corporate-owned media harder to 
                    come by than ever, this is another avenue that may have to 
                    be explored.</font></p>

                    Black Commentator 
                    recommends that readers interested in identifying the corporate-funded 
                    black Trojan Horses among their Democratic elected officials 
                    peruse the DLC/New Democrat online directory of local elected 
                    officials and its &quot;100 Democrats to Watch&quot; page. 
                    There will be a lot of watching and some calling to accounts 
                    in the near future. In the words of Rep. Jackson, again: </font></p>

<p align="left"><span class="bc">Fifteen-hundred 
                    activists showed up in Washington last week to rally under 
                    the banner, &quot;Take Back America,&quot; but the real agenda 
                    was to take the Democratic Party back from the DLC. Although 
                    conference turnout was triple that of last year, progressives 
                    remain on the defensive, largely ignored by corporate media 
                    and relentless reviled by the now-entrenched DLC. As organizer 
                    Robert Borosage told the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A21166-2003Jun5?language=printer" target="_new">Washington 
                    Post</a>, &quot;They want to read the peace movement out of the party. That's goofy politics .... The base of the Democratic 
                    Party is here.&quot;</span></p>
<p align="left"><font class="bc">The 
                    DLC also seeks to purge the Black Consensus from black electoral 
                    politics, a consensus that is overwhelmingly for peace. As 
                    Black Commentator 
                    wrote in a <a href="http://www.blackcommentator.com/17_analysis.html" target="_new">November 
                    21</a> analysis:</font></p>
<div align="left"> 
                    
<blockquote><span class="bc"><font class="bc"><i>The 
                      black political dialogue occurs almost entirely on the Left,

</div>
<blockquote> 
                    
<p align="left"><i><span class="bc">The 
                      JCPES poll confirms that only one out of five African Americans 
                      (19.2%) support this government's war preparations. The 
                      finding is consistent with black political opinion as measured 
                      over the decades since the Vietnam War. Anti-war opinion 
                      is a core element of the Black Consensus, unbroken over 
                      two generations and indicating a much deeper distrust of 
                      the motives of those in power ....</span></i></p>
<p align="left"><i><span class="bc">In 
                      every practical sense, this measurement places the bulk 
                      of African Americans firmly on the left side of the American 
                      political spectrum. Indeed, the consistency of black anti-war 
                      opinion over time strongly indicates a radical perspective 
                      at the heart of the Black Consensus.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><span class="bc">The 
                    Black Consensus is also a &quot;big government&quot; agenda,

<p align="left"><span class="bc">Ralph 
                    Neas, President of People for the American Way, seemed confident 
                    that the DLC can be beaten back this primary cycle. &quot;We've 
                    been preparing a long time for this,&quot; said Neas to the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0607-05.htm" target="_new">Hartford

<p align="left">
The 
                    right-wing nominee's name is Joe Lieberman. If he wins the 
                    nomination, it will be time to head for the exits of the national 
                    Democratic Party.
