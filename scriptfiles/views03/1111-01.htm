<p>The origin of Veterans Day goes back to 1921 when an unidentified World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.<p>
Back then they called it "Armistice Day." But when it became apparent that the "war to end all wars" was yet another empty promise of peace through violence, "Armistice Day" became Veterans Day, via a 1954 bill signed by then President Eisenhower.<p>
On this Veterans Day, I find myself asking: Will Armistice Day ever return? How did we go from fighting "a war to end all wars" to fighting a war without end? How do we properly honor our deserving vets at a time when U.S. policymakers have ordered our fighting men and women to serve in an illegal occupation of Iraq?<p>
Perhaps we can honor our vets by listening to them more carefully. Here's an excerpt from a letter being sent to President Bush by a loosely affiliated group of combat vets.<p>
"At present, U.S. soldiers are falling under attack an average of 35 times each day. To date, 381 U.S. soldiers have been killed in the war. Their lives are being lost for a policy that is unclear and an exit strategy that remains unknown.<p>
"Mr. President, we regret that you oppose planned increases in monthly imminent danger pay and family separation allowances for troops getting bombed and shot at in Iraq.<p>
"We also regret that your supporters in the Senate blocked a provision in the $87.5 billion emergency supplemental which would have provided $1.3 billion for veterans' health programs. This new funding would have provided urgently needed money to maintain what remains an inadequate status quo."<p>
I guess, the flag-waving "support our troops" war cheerleaders have been too busy chastising the "anti-American" peace movement to have noticed that their commander-in-chief is not actually supporting the troops.<p>
And because our "free press" is getting less and less access to the ground-truth in Iraq, I have been seeking out family members of those serving in Iraq in order to get a PR-free sense of what's going on over there.<p>
Jari Sheese of Indianapolis, whose husband is currently serving in Iraq, has this to report: "He doesn't want to be there any more. There was a time he felt they were doing some good, but that has gone. He helped set up the Iraqi Media Network. He enjoyed working with the Iraqis, helping them set up six television stations and three radio stations, but since the 82nd Airborne took over, they've been making the Iraqis broadcast things like statements from generals over and over and over again.<p>
"The Iraqis now say that it's eerily like under Saddam's regime, even calling one of the commanders 'little Saddam.' The commanders are threatening to take the Iraqis' equipment or funding away if they don't do what they say, but they advertise this 'new, free Iraq.' The military is not a democracy and this doesn't really seem like the way to help build democratic institutions there.<p>
". . . It's incredible how badly the reservists are treated. He just got a new flak jacket about a week ago, but it doesn't have the ceramic plate. He says it's better than nothing. The media used to go to bases, but many have been kicked out now, so information is getting harder and harder to come by. Bush says that we have to stay to stop the attacks, but it's clear that our staying is causing attacks."<p>
"Stay the course" or leave Iraq immediately? It's a false choice. Our invasion legally and morally obligates us to see the job through.<p>
But a third way is offered by Gulf War vet Erik Gustaffason of the Education for Peace in Iraq Center. "When we talk about involving more Iraqis we're talking about giving up some control, which is a lesson the Bush administration hasn't learned yet. We need a fundamental change in policy toward Iraq."
