<p>You can actually get a few things done with $87 billion, the amount that 
President Bush has asked Congress to appropriate for expenditures 
related to the military occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. 

<p>For example: 

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and other UN bodies estimate the 
cost of providing treatment and prevention services in developing 
countries for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria at $12 billion a year. 

<p>The WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health estimated that donor 
investment of $27 billion a year, including expenditures on TB, AIDS and 
malaria, as well as to eliminate death and suffering from other 
infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, could save 8 million 
lives a year. That's eight million lives. A year. 

<p>The UN Development Program estimated in 1998 that the annual additional 
cost of achieving basic education for all was $6 billion. 

<p>Prefer to spend some or all of the money at home? Even in the United 
States, where the dollar doesn't go as far, $87 billion can perform some 
pretty impressive feats. 

<p>For example, according to Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, it 
would only cost $6 billion a year to provide health insurance to all 
uninsured children in the United States. You can provide Head Start and 
Early Head Start to all eligible children for $8 billion annually. You 
can reduce class size to 15 students per teacher in all first-, second- 
and third-grade classrooms for $11 billion a year. 

<p>For $87 billion, you could eliminate the backlog of maintenance needs at 
national parks nearly 15 times over. You could cover more than half the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-estimated 20-year investment needs 
to ensure safe drinking water throughout the United States. You could 
more than double the annual capital expenditures needed to improve 
public transportation in the United States, according to estimates of 
the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. 
You could provide almost half of the overall funding EPA says is needed 
to provide clean watersheds in the United States, including through 
wastewater treatment, sewer upgrades and nonpoint source pollution control. 

<p>It just so happens, as the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities 
points out, that $87 billion is almost exactly what all departments in 
the federal government combined spend annually on education, training, 
employment and social services. So you could fund that for a year. 

<p>If you looked at the $87 billion as found money, and wanted to do 
something unorthodox, you could eliminate California's state budget 
deficit two times over. 

<p>And, you would still have enough left over to enable the Detroit Tigers 
(baseball's worst team) next year to field a team full of Alex 
Rodriguez's. (Rodriguez, at $25 million a year, is baseball's 
highest-paid player. A full roster -- 25 players -- of Rodriguez's would 
cost $625 million.) 

<p>We accept that having imposed devastating economic sanctions on Iraq for 
a decade and twice waged war on the country, the United States has a 
major obligation to support reconstruction in Iraq. But three-quarters 
of the president's request is for military expenses, not reconstruction, 
the request follows a previous $79 billion appropriation, additional 
requests are certain to follow, and much of the money being spent on 
reconstruction is being funneled as poorly scrutinized corporate welfare 
to Bush and Vice President Cheney's buddies at companies like 
Halliburton and Bechtel. 


<p>If one steps back for a moment, it is evident that there is a long list 
of expenditures that would do more to improve the world, and more to 
improve U.S. security if reasonably defined, than what the president 
proposes to do in Iraq. 

<p>A strange circumstance has evolved in the United States. Military 
expenditures can be justified at almost any level. ("Whatever it takes 
to defend freedom.") Politicians don't say, "Whatever it takes to make 
sure every child in this country has a decent education." Or, "Whatever 
it takes to deal with the worst health pandemic in the history of the 
world (HIV/AIDS)." When it comes to the military, there is neither a 
sense of proportion, nor of trade offs. 

<p>This state of affairs is a tribute to the military contractors and 
political leaders who have ridden to power by instilling fear in the 
populace. It can be traced in no small part to campaign contributions 
and lobbyist influence, but the problem runs much deeper than that. Fear 
has penetrated deep into the culture. 

<p>But the administration's overreach in Iraq now offers an opportunity to 
create a new sense of priorities. It is now even more apparent than it 
was before the war that Iraq posed no security threat to the United 
States. And the sums of money requested by the administration -- and 
more will be coming -- are so extraordinary that they practically demand 
consideration of alternative expenditures. 

<p>After all, you really can do quite a bit with $87 billion.
