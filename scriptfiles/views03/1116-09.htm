<p>“The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) will spread freedom, liberty and democracy to all the peoples of the Americas.” This is one of the many tall tales free traders repeat in newspaper interviews, on television and radio programs and at public debates. But if someone were to ask them to explain how, their response would be similar to a deer in headlights.  That’s because it’s difficult to defend a statement that has no factual evidence to support it. The FTAA would actually undermine democracy by granting transnational corporations the ability to overturn labor laws and environmental regulations, thus stripping countries of their sovereignty and citizens of their rights to self-determination. Here’s how.

 

<p>The North American Free Trade Agreement (in a clause under Chapter 11) provides foreign investors the ability to challenge local, state and federal laws of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, for cash compensation—taxpayer money. This is unprecedented, as it allows corporations to sue nations for the first time in history. The FTAA would adopt NAFTA's investor rights and as a result leave 31 more countries ripe for the picking.  

 

<p>This has the potential to generate an explosive number of new cases. A 2002 <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/" target="_new">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a> report said that in the U.S. alone, these investor rights could cost American taxpayers over $30 billion per year under the FTAA.

 

<p>Just this summer Canadian mining company Glamis filed Notice of Intent that it will bring a $50 million claim against the U.S. for actions taken by California to protect the environment and indigenous communities from the harmful impact of open-pit mining. Its venue: a closed-door arbitration tribunal, with no public access or oversight. California’s attorney general won’t even have an official role in the case. Citizens of the state are forced to rely on federal government agencies such as the Office of the United States Trade Representative to defend their laws and well-being. So the same office that helped push through the legal framework that allows Glamis to file their $50 million claim is supposed to win a case against them. If you find this disturbing you’re not alone. 

 

<p>The National Association of Attorneys General passed a resolution in 2002 denouncing this breach of legal sanity. The resolution states:

 

<p> 
<blockquote>&quot;Foreign investors should have no greater rights to seek financial compensation than U.S. citizens possess under the U.S. Constitution or the State Constitutions…International arbitration panels convened under international trade agreements should have no jurisdiction or authority to award financial compensation based on challenges to the rulings of U.S., state or federal courts.” 

 

</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the U.S. National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the National Association of Towns and Townships are among other groups that sent letters to lawmakers last year urging them to pass legislation that protects our laws and our citizens—both under attack by NAFTA and possibly the FTAA. 

 

<p>So, if the FTAA is ratified, the democratic process will be obsolete. Laws passed by legislators to protect the citizens who voted them in office will be meaningless. Or instead, local, state and national governments will face ridiculous fines that will force them to either settle out of court (blackmail?) or pay the fines determined by a corporate friendly arbitration tribunal. Either way, tax revenues that are desperately needed for schools, hospitals and other public services will instead be awarded to transnational corporations. These corporations can then pack up and hit the next country.

 

<p>It makes sense that free trade deals like the FTAA are negotiated and drafted behind closed doors, in buildings surrounded by a wall of police. Civil society is shut out because no one in their right mind would voluntarily forfeit safeguards to their rights and health. 

 

<p>The only freedom extended under the FTAA would be to multinational corporations. They would be granted the freedom to trample over our democracy, the freedom to discard labor laws and environmental regulations, and the freedom to bilk citizens of the hemisphere out of their tax money that would be used for essential public services. This would leave the rest of us free to suffer.
