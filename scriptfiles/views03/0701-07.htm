<p>The first man to underestimate Americans was King George, 227 years ago. He wasn't the last.
In an eight-minute speech at the CIA on Sep. 26, 2001, President Bush finished with a mostly coherent incantation about how terrorists have "misunderestimated" America: "The folks who conducted to act on our country on September 11th made a big mistake," he said. "They underestimated America. They underestimated our resolve, our determination, our love for freedom. They misunderestimated the fact that we love a neighbor in need. They misunderestimated the compassion of our country. I think they misunderestimated the will and determination of the commander in chief, too."

<p>Malapropisms aside, it wasn't an uninspiring speech, lifting as it did from Winston Churchill's "we shall never surrender" address to the House of Commons toward the beginning of World War II. But white flags were trembling all over Europe in 1940. The Nazis looked so invulnerable that in the less-quoted portion of the same speech, Churchill considered that if Britain "or a large part of it were subjugated and starving," it would be up to the colonies "beyond the seas [to] carry on the struggle." No such possibility has ever faced the United States after Sept. 11 -- not in anybody's wildest fears. The attacks were barbaric and stunningly effective, but their magnitude didn't make them any less freakish. The country was shocked, slightly dented, greatly aggrieved, because Americans are a feeling people. But our "way of life" was never threatened. Look around: Routines haven't changed a whit, and not because of the cosmetic precautions of such brave new world inventions as the Department of Homeland Security, but in spite of them.

<p>Yet the president's brawny rhetoric, understandable in the smoldering aftermath of the attacks, became less, not more, measured with time. As have his actions. Announcing the beginning of the war in Afghanistan two weeks after the CIA speech, Bush ended with the now famous coda: "We will not tire, we will not falter and we will not fail." Reviewers called the phrases Churchillian, but the phrases owed more to H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds" than to anything more realistic, or less sensational. It isn't that a counter-offensive on terrorism wasn't warranted. But Sept. 11 wasn't, as New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman continues to insist, "the beginning of World War III." So you couldn't blame world opinion for balking when Bush turned Dr. Strangelove.

<p>But the president isn't much concerned about world opinion. The aim of his Texas-salted rhetoric -- "you're either with us or you're with the terrorists" -- wasn't meant only for allies and would-be enemies abroad. It was to define the meaning of Americanism at home, to draw supporters as patriots and dissenters as traitors. With the jingo press and its radio chat jocks as enforcers, Bush acted early and often to make a loyalty oath of that dividing line and to keep drawing it all the way to the next election. It has worked wonders. Would-be dissenters (most of them, anyway) have either gone silent or fallen in line behind the president. Liberals have stumbled over each other, trying to prove, Friedman-style, how this time it really is different, how we mustn't lose sight of the real enemies out there.

<p>Sure enough, some diehard dissenters have managed to sound as if Bush were worse than either Osama or Saddam. But Bush's jingoes have just as idiotically managed to make dissenters seem as dangerous to America as Osama and Saddam put together. Dumb dividing lines make for dumb dichotomies. But it isn't a matter of who's worse. To phrase the matter this way plays into the hands of jingoes, because the answer is a set-up. Who in his right mind would say that Bush is worse than Saddam? The real question is: To what extent has Bush abetted Saddam and Osama's relevance by making them out to be as dangerous as Hitler or Stalin? To what extent has he lied to make them seem more of a threat to America than they actually are? To what extent is he changing government and trampling the Constitution, with his patriotic-security apparatchiks, in order to solidify his political cult (which the country, in a national malapropism of its own, confuses with clout)? And to what extent have Americans bought into such a whopper of mass delusion?

<p>On Bush's watch domestic insecurities have never been so expedient, foreign threats never so imaginary, patriotism never such a "grotesque and laughable word," as Mark Twain once put it. Bush has made brandishing a flag (or a cruise missile) a self-evident virtue, absolving its bearer of reflection or responsibility. But that's the way of the fanatic. And on this July 4, that is what we are, mostly, because we still believe in this president, mostly.

<p>It isn't a flaw to be naturally trusting. But Bush is underestimating Americans' capacity to adjust, to detect a fraud, even when it is their own king. King George found out. The reigning King George will, too, if we are to raise the banner of critical independence again.
