<p>When I see them lying in the street, their wrists being lashed with 

plastic as if they're bundles of produce, I hope the rest of the world 

is seeing them too. The protesters do more for homeland security than 

Tom Ridge and all the border patrols combined. Cameras would serve this 

country well if they aim their lenses at these active citizens and 

record the statements they and their bodies are making within the 

context of a free society. They make not only a wonderful statement but 

a wonderful example. The streets of other countries should know that 

there is a movement here that has not disconnected itself from the 

plight of citizens in Iraq or in any country that is being bombed in the 

name of and with the money of the American people.

<p>The polls in support of the war reflect mainly the success of 

indoctrination. Bush can stand up at a podium as if he's on the Jerry 

Springer show and say that he has just heard that Iraqi soldiers have 

cut the tongue out of a dissenter and "let him bleed to death in the 

middle of the town square." There is no source or verification - there 

doesn't need to be. It may or may not be true - it only needs to be 

glossy and gruesome and make his war seem holy.

<p>Blair, whose name I have noticed is an anagram for "Liar-B" is taking 

the lesson from Liar-A, which is - say anything. The sister of a soldier 

Blair claimed was executed by the Iraqi regime has denounced Blair. She 

says he lied and that she was told her brother was killed in action - on 

the spot. It was a twist of the knife that Blair felt compelled to give 

her and the world a more painful scenario. The mission, which he has 

accepted like a dutiful Oxford debating team member, is to keep the 

public disgusted with the enemy and thereby continue to gain support. It 

also makes peace activists and protesters seem tolerant of barbarism. 

How could they want us to stop prosecuting a war against people who 

would do such things?

<p>The horror stories have recently and will continue to accelerate. 

Protesters are protesting war, which allows and releases the worst in 

human beings. An enlisted man told me that a sergeant in the U. S. army 

who had trained him, kept a bag of fingers he had cut off of dead Iraqi 

soldiers during the first Gulf war. That also may or may not be true - 

but any incomprehensible behavior - substantiated or unsubstantiated - 

is not proof of how terrible "these" or any people are - it's proof of 

how psychotic war is and how it encourages psychotic behavior. The self 

righteous "Ah-ha's" out of Bush and Blair are manipulative and self 

serving and are neither honest nor examined. If anything they make the 

case for peace activists who could respond to Bush and Blair - Yes - 

Look what war does to human beings - not just to their bodies but to 

their minds and personalities. War is the atrocity and its legacy will 

last for generations. That's why people are lying in the streets in New 

York and San Francisco.

<p>There never has been any doubt there is the beast in every human being. 

Pressure, stresses, oppression, experience, pathology, attack - all 

contribute to the beast taking over. Imagine the personalities of 

Limbaugh, Hannity, Savage or DeLay if they were cornered in Basra. War 

will discharge the urges and behavior we hoped culture, constitutions, 

legal systems, spiritual leaders, art and even commerce would keep in 

check. Bush in fact has shunned all of these because he himself does not 

want to be civilized or regulated by them. The protesters, on the other 

hand, want their country to be tempered by those universal structures 

and as much as possible keep the beast at least harnessed. Instead, 

advocates for peace are themselves being harnessed, cuffed, muffled and 

insulted.

<p>I think it would be wise for journalists to be embedded in the peace 

movement. I would like to see a journalist in a protest dressed not in 

battle fatigues with a helmet and a bulletproof vest but holding a sign 

and saying "we" when speaking about the group - United For Peace - 

Voices in the Wilderness - 9/11 Families For Peace - or Not in Our Name.

<p>The expansion of the war has begun. Rumsfeld has given warning shots to 

Syria and Iran. Putin has said that the relationship between the U. S. 

and Russia is approaching its lowest point since the height of the cold 

war. This country at the moment is like the largest dinosaur on the 

plains- with its massive muscularity, stride and chops - it is however 

being ordered about by a tiny cluster of simple synapses - no dexterity 

of thought or imagination. Just thud and chomp. In contrast the open 

hands of the activist patriot citizens are publicly hog-tied. The hands 

reaching out to restore a brotherhood and sisterhood to the rest of the 

unsettled world are being punished and vilified by the country they're 

trying to protect and regain.
