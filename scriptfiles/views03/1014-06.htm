<p>"Two Dean Rivals Unite Against Mutual Threat" was the Sunday headline in the New York Times that grabbed my attention. 

<p>What could the threat be, I wondered. Anthrax? Republicans? The answer came quickly. Kerry and Gephardt have formed an alliance to stop not Bush, but the "threat" of former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. 

<p>If Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt, whose presidential campaigns are down in the polls in key states, are successful in destroying Dean, what happens next? Will Gephardt then team up with North Carolina Sen. John Edwards to kill off Kerry, or will Kerry beat Gephardt to that punch? And on and on it will go, Democrats devouring Democrats while the money boys chortle on the sidelines. 

<p>Watching the low blows being thrown at the national level serves as a painful reminder of how much the Democratic Party has lost as it has become obsessed with winning at any cost - even the cost of one's soul - and how sleazy big money politics feeds that blind ambition. 

<p>Instead of having faith in the ideas and values that have historically proven to be winners for the party of Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy, too many Democrats at the national level willingly abandon those ideas and values - and even their fellow Democrats - in a mad rush to destroy one another and, ultimately, any sense that being a Democrat might mean something. 

<p>Sadly, this is not merely a distant crisis for national Democrats. 

<p>Wisconsin is rapidly losing our once proud tradition of clean and substantive Democratic politics. We were once thrilled to listen to Gaylord Nelson, governor and then senator, Congressman Bob Kastenmeier, and one of my favorites, Henry Reuss, the Milwaukee congressman whose Point Four Youth program became the Peace Corps under JFK. 

<p>Our neighbor to the west, Minnesota, often honored us with visits from Gene McCarthy, Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale and Congressmen Don Frazer and Jim Oberstar. 

<p>We felt that the Upper Midwest was the hotbed of ideas with big plans, from national health care to the belief that we could end poverty through free education. 

<p>In the late '60s we rallied to Midge Miller, Bobby Kennedy, George McGovern to stop the war. We marched and sat in with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Martin Luther King and Diane Nash. We were, in a word, moved by passion and compassion. Issues mattered. 

<p>Today? Well, today the Democrats are no longer the hotbed of ideas, and have no big plans. Worse, they accept poverty as part of the human condition. Democrats have become reactionaries, a title once reserved for the Republican Party. They react to the program initiatives put forward by the right-wing ideologues from the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute and our own Bradley Foundation fellow, Charlie Sykes. 

<p>Instead of taking them on in debate, we try to nip at the edges, modify the program, hint that we are better managers but just as mean. 

<p>Democrats in the Legislature decided they should be tougher on welfare than the Republicans and so they jumped on board the Bradley Foundation-Hudson Institute idea of Wisconsin Works, or W-2. 

<p>Why? 

<p>Because it would eliminate poverty or create jobs? Help the children of poverty find a better life? Of course not. 

<p>They joined with the bad guys to avoid criticism from right-wing talk show hosts Sykes and Mark Belling. 

<p>And how about those corporate tax breaks? It has been a race to see which party can do more for big business rather than the middle income taxpayers who don't contribute much to campaigns. 

<p>Democratic candidates decided that they must raise money from the same sources as the Republicans. The result? They have tamped down their progressive spirit, spending more time talking about the need for "investment" than the notion of asking corporations to pay their fair share of the state's tax burden. 

<p>Gaylord Nelson and John Reynolds were willing to tackle this sort of fundamental issue. They were willing to offend corporate givers because they operated within a philosophical framework and raised money from Democrats. 

<p>How do Wisconsin Democrats conduct campaigns now? They follow the pattern of the national party, and the national party is into fund raising, funneling money through front groups and negative attacks. 

<p>In Wisconsin, Gary George and other Democrats - even a few labor groups - now hire one-time Republican hatchet man Todd Rongstad to unleash his virulent strain of political disease against other Democrats. When Democrats take the leash off Rongstad, the winners are the Republicans. Demagogues like Charlie Sykes love the show when they smear decent people like Julie Lassa. 

<p>What does all this big money get Democrats? A fuzzing of the ideological boundaries so extreme that electing a Democratic governor no longer means what it once did. 

<p>In reality, there is not much difference in policy under Jim Doyle and Tommy Thompson on the big issues. Policies are driven by election cash, not a desire to achieve social and economic justice. Tax breaks for big business, power lines, no change in corrections policy, shortchanging the university and thereby giving voice to those who would privatize our gem, no serious effort to bring about public financing of elections. The result is that the Democrat Party is on its heels. 

<p>Instead of trimming our prison population with sensible proposals to release the nonviolent inmates with less than two years to serve, the Democrats timidly "me too" the policies of the hard-liners at Corrections to send them away for longer and more expensive sentences while the state goes broke. 

<p>The Democrats are in a minority in both houses and barely won the governor's chair against a guy who was about as popular as Gray Davis. They are in danger of becoming a permanent minority because they are not speaking out to the parents of special needs children while going along with higher tuition. They are not speaking out to the African-American community or to Hispanics, or to working families. They find themselves as defenders of the worst tax of all - the property tax. Why? Because otherwise they would have to repeal corporate tax breaks and the campaign funders wouldn't like that. 

<p>The challenge to Wisconsin Democrats is to find their soul and their voice. If they do, they will convince the cynics to get out and vote. If it is business as usual, they will lose.
