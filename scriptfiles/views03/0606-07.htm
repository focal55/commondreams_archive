<p>On June 2, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to loosen 
the rules governing media ownership. As a result, media companies might 
become even larger and the number of voices heard from in our society 
even fewer.  If the measure of a democracy is in the strength of its 
voices, American's may soon become a whisper.  If that happens, Wall 
Street would decide what is heard on Main Street and the American 
democracy would suffer as a result. 
<p>Under the new rules, it will be possible for a single media company like 
Clear Channel Communications or News Corp., to buy the dominant 
newspaper, the local cable-television system, three local television 
stations and eight radio stations in a single market.  In other words, 
the rules were designed to encourage a massive consolidation of the 
media industry, and a massive financial windfall for large media 
companies and Wall Street.  It should come as no surprise that the most 
effective lobbyist for this legislation was a Wall Street media analyst 
from the investment-banking firm Bear Stearns. 
<p>For example, these new rules would allow Clear Channel Communications, 
which owns eight radio stations in San Francisco (KABL-AM 960, K101-FM 
101.3,KISQ-FM 98.1,KKSF-FM 103.7, KMEL-FM 106, KNEW-AM 960 and KSJO 98.5 
FM) to also own the San Francisco Chronicle, KRON-TV Channel 4 and 
KTVU-TV Channel 2 as well. 
Since the electronic media has become the dominant source of information 
in our society, this would be an awesome responsibility. 
<p>Proponents promise these new media goliaths can handle this kind of 
responsibility. Maybe. The reality could be much different.  It will 
take money to finance this media consolidation, and that money will be 
raised in the capital markets.  As a result, programming might reflect 
the need to make debt payments and otherwise appease Wall Street, not 
the culturally diverse view points in American society.  The need for 
cash might also make it more likely that news coverage of a story that 

makes advertisers (or political 
allies) uncomfortable could be compromised. 
<p>We've already seen examples of how this may look from two companies 
which stand to benefit greatly from the rules changes.  Fox News, owned 
by News Corp., covered the war in Iraq with a nationalistic fervor. 
Just as News Corp. removed the BBC News Service from its Chinese 
satellite package to win favor with the Chinese government.  Compare 
that to Clear Channel's treatment of the popular country music group the 
Dixie Chicks.  After some members of the band spoke out against the war 
in Iraq, Dixie Chicks songs were mysteriously dropped from some Clear 
Channel play lists. 
<p>Maybe the Dixie Chicks absence from the airways had nothing to do with 
the company's close ties with the Bush administration.  But when 
Trillium Asset Management Corp. asked Clear Channel if it would create a 
policy specifically prohibiting their stations from blacklisting artists 
for their political views, they responded that they would not.  Not a 
very rigorous defense of American ideals and a very short-sighted 
business strategy.  
Individual rights and the exchange of information and ideas are the 
reasons why the capital markets flourished in this country.  Diminish 
either and the markets will suffer as well. When television news 
supplanted daily newspapers as the country's number one source of 
information, networks like CBS considered their news divisions a public 
service, and journalists like Walter Cronkite were trusted for 
presenting objective reports of the day's events.  The FCC may have 
ensured that will never happen again.  If that is indeed the case, the 
FCC brokered a deal that is unacceptable and un-American. 
And that's not the way it should be.
