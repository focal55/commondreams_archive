<p>The White House is letting on that our latest war against Iraq is over and won, but than can't be right, can it? 

<p>The Dixie Chicks are still at large. Where is Attorney General John — "Off with their heads!" — Ashcroft when you need him? 

<p>Certainly the U.S. military has stomped and scattered what passed for the Iraqi armed forces. What's left, here and there, couldn't get up a decent bar fight. And the remnant bigwigs of the Baathist leadership are either being winkled out of their hidey-holes or are turning themselves in to explain that they had no idea, none whatsoever, what was going on in Saddam Hussein's regime. 

<p>But how safe can the nation really be as long as the Chicks are allowed to go around the country armed with a banjo, guitar and fiddle? 

<p>If you are among the, alas, too many citizens distracted by such trivialities as geopolitical upheavals and new disease epidemics, failing airlines and moribund 401(k)s, you may be unaware of the Dixie Chicks menace. 

<p>The threat surfaced a couple of weeks ago in London, where the popular Texas trio — who mix traditional country music and progressive bluegrass (i.e., amplified acoustic with a diminished chord here and there ) — were performing. 

<p>The lead singer, chunky Chick Natalie Maines, blurted out, "Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas." 

<p>A shaken republic has tried to fight back. 

<p>Radio stations around the country have banned Chicks recordings. The trio had the No. 1 country hit one week and the next it was somewhere south of Regis Philbin's cover of "Rubber Ducky." 

<p>One station set up curbside garbage cans so patriotic listeners could do drive-by discards of Chicks CDs. In Louisiana, a stack of Chicks recordings was crushed by a 33,000-pound bulldozer, to general glee. 

<p>A fellow country music performer, letting patriot fervor get the better of idiomatic solidarity, counseled the public to "hit 'em in the pocketbook." The angry men of right-wing talk radio have, of course, heaped rants on the three. 

<p>And the South Carolina House of Representatives passed a resolution demanding that the Chicks apologize to South Carolinians — and by the way, as penance, do a free concert there. (State legislators, as students of venality, know that gimmes are the wages of sin.) 

<p>For their part, fighting back on behalf of free speech, the Chicks have posed naked for a magazine cover. 

<p>All of this, so far, does not quite add up to a new round of the Federalist Papers, and the Chicks are still trying to find explanatory language that will heal a wounded nation and, incidentally, placate paying customers. 

<p>(Pop singer Sinead O'Connor, who once created a similar storm when she tore up a photo of the pope during a performance, has since been ordained as a priest in the Latin Tridentine Church, which, despite its name, is not a chewing gum but an oddball sort of Catholicism. Maybe the Chicks could start their own nunnery. O'Connor, by the way, now wishes to be known as Mother Bernadette.) 

<p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is in the Middle East, taking a victory lap. That's at best premature. We still haven't caught Osama, Saddam or Natalie.
