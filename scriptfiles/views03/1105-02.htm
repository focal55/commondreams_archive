<p>Margaret Tutwiler, like Condoleeza Rice, is a Birmingham girl raised in the South (GRITS) who needs our help.  Tutwiler knows her way around Washington as former assistant secretary of state for public affairs under “41” (George Herbert Walker Bush) and has just returned from her post as ambassador to Morocco.  She has a solid knowledge base in business, foreign policy, and public relations, but she’s facing a public diplomacy task that is almost insurmountable without the help of her neighbors and friends.   

<p>You cannot pick up a newspaper these days without reading the latest difficulties facing America’s image problem in the world—the rise in anti-Americanism and global public opinion polls that show many ready to blame the United States for all the world’s ills.

<p>Tutwiler is soon to fill the position of undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, a sort of “Welcome Wagon” meets “Putting One’s Best Food Forward” approach to informing, influencing and engaging citizens overseas.  Don’t Southerners know a thing or two about making people feel at home and at ease?  It’s called Southern hospitality, and it is one of the many charming features of our region that should be put to practice in public diplomacy efforts.  Tutwiler is replacing Texan Charlotte Beers, who with her Madison Avenue background in touting Uncle Ben’s Rice, never had a chance to overcome the guffaws that marked her 18-month tenure.  

<p>During Tutwiler’s confirmation hearings last week, Senator Joseph Biden, D-Del., wondered aloud how the United States continues to be “all thumbs” when it comes to public diplomacy.  This echoed the sentiment expressed from Representative Henry Hyde, R-Ill., two years ago at the time of Charlotte Beers’ confirmation hearings: “How is it that the country that invented Hollywood and Madison Avenue has such trouble promoting a positive image of itself overseas?" 

<p>Political leadership in Washington keeps scratching its head in wonder why the leading country in the world in advertising, public relations and marketing cannot seem to do an effective job on itself. 

<p>It is precisely because U.S. public diplomacy is being conducted from an uptown, top-down, and inside-the-beltway perspective that we aren’t making headway.  Packaging public diplomacy in commercials, slick packaging, fancy language, or status reports won’t improve America’s image in the world and will probably just reinforce negative perceptions. 

<p>We need to get back to basics that people hold in common--friendliness, openness, and putting people at ease—a Southern charm offensive.  It needs to be based on discussion and dialogue with those people who are at times skeptical toward the United States and with others who are downright hostile.  We need to listen and learn, more than dictate and declare.  As Tutwiler herself pointed out in her confirmation hearing:  “Much of what I learned about our country, from listening, engaging and interacting with Moroccans from all walks of life, was troubling and disturbing.  I would never have known how our country is really viewed, both the positives and the negatives, had I not been serving overseas for the last two turbulent years.”   

<p>Tutwiler needs to call on not only the South but all private citizens who are willing to help to get involved in a “Welcome to the Neighborhood” campaign that builds upon the well-intended but poorly run “Shared Values” campaign of the Beers’ tenure.  The United States holds no patent on democracy or freedom, but we are part of a larger and majority neighborhood of global and civic-minded nations that cherish the democratic process and democratic ideals over tyranny and dictatorial control.  We need to roll out our welcome sign of inclusiveness that what the world most admires about us (productivity, entrepreneurial spirit, education, freedom to practice religion, free speech) is what we want to share and help them build on in their own community.  This means our public diplomacy in Iraq must be led with an attitude of respect for individual dignity that we are guests in the homes of the Iraqi people, not the other way around.  

<p>I’m confident in the expertise of Margaret Tutwiler and am relieved that in her congressional hearing she said that when it comes to tackling the complex reality of winning hearts and minds, “There is not one magic bullet, magic program or magic solution. As much as we would like to think Washington knows best, we have to be honest and admit we do not necessarily always have all the answers.”  

<p>Tutwiler is absolutely right.  Washington does not have all the answers about public diplomacy.  Why don’t you enlist some Steel Magnolias to help?
