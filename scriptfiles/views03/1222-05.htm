<p>WHEN IT COMES to official memory, cleanliness truly is next to godliness.

<p>This is what I thought, anyway, after viewing the Enola Gay exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum's new facility at Dulles Airport outside Washington, D.C. The plaque describing the infamous B-29 "Superfortress" could scarcely be more sanitized. Consisting of two paragraphs, the text refers to the Enola Gay's historic significance with just one sentence: "On Aug. 6, 1945, this Martin-built B-29-45-MO dropped the first atomic weapon used in combat on Hiroshima, Japan."

<p>Tsuboi Sunao was there in Hiroshima on that fateful day. He was also at the Dulles annex on Monday [Dec. 15], joining scores of others--American and Japanese--to protest the Smithsonian's vapid Enola Gay exhibit.

<p>The 140,000 or so people (almost all civilians) who died from the Hiroshima bombing were partly victims of "a type of human experiment," and partly unfortunates whom the United States sacrificed to make a point to the Soviets, Sunao told me.

<p>Most Americans subscribe to a different "truth," the one summed up recently in my paper by Air Force Magazine editor Robert S. Dudney: "Imperial Japan started the war, waged it savagely, and refused to surrender until the bombs fell."

<p>Such pronouncements usually are made to dismiss accounts by shady types known as "historical revisionists." And yet, a review of the U.S. government's own postwar assessment suggests that the orthodox view, as articulated by Dudney and others, may have been the original historical revision.

<p>Just after Japan's surrender, the secretary of war sent a team of analysts called the United States Strategic Bombing Survey to Japan to evaluate the effects of America's bombing campaign. Among other things, the group was charged with ascertaining how the aerial assault (both conventional and
nuclear) affected the morale of Japanese citizens and the decision-making of Japan's wartime leaders.

<p>The team's conclusions fly in the face of what we now consider the conventional wisdom. "It cannot be said that the atomic bomb convinced the leaders who effected the peace of the necessity of surrender," the Survey says.

<p>Members of the Japanese government began exploring the peace option in 1944, the analysts note, and in late spring of 1945, Japan's Supreme War Guidance Council, with the emperor present, made the decision to surrender. Around this time, the team says, Japan initiated talks with the Soviets seeking their intercession as mediator in peace talks.

<p>The analysts' ultimate conclusion contradicts the common assertion in this country that the United States would have been forced to invade Japan if it had not dropped the atomic bombs: "[I]t is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated."


<p>A mythical narrative


<p>But is this a classic case of hindsight being 20/20? Did our leaders know that Japan was in such a desperate situation and that it was pursuing peace?

<p>The answer to that second question is, yes, probably. The United States knew of Japan's overtures to the Soviets. Washington also had broken Tokyo's secret code and therefore must have known that Japan would surrender if it was allowed to keep the emperor (which the United States eventually permitted anyway).

<p>Postwar comments by U.S. military commanders indicate that Washington had a pretty clear understanding of Japan's untenable position. Gen. Curtis LeMay, who devised the "total war" bombing campaign against Japan, said the United States' conventional air attacks were "driving [the Japanese] back to the Stone Age." Gen. "Hap" Arnold, commander of the Army Air Forces during the war, wrote in his memoirs: "It always appeared to us, atomic bomb or no atomic bomb, the Japanese were already on the verge of collapse." Then there's Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who once stated: "It wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing."

<p>At the very least, what all this evidence tells us is that the circumstances surrounding the atomic bombings of Japan were considerably more complicated than what the official story suggests.

<p>The Smithsonian tried to present some of this complexity in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the bombings. The museum envisioned an exhibit that would include photos of the Hiroshima bombing's victims, mention of the attack's death toll, and reference to the debate about the necessity of using the bomb.

<p>But veterans groups--joined eventually by many members of Congress--pressured the museum to scrap most of the exhibit, reducing it to an innocuous description of the plane and video footage of the crew discussing their mission.

<p>It would be unfair to blame only vets for this debacle; Americans, like people everywhere, want to view themselves as fundamentally good, and this has led us to construct a mythical narrative about our nation.

<p>But this project entails suppressing or denying information that contradicts the mythical "America." Ordinarily, pressure groups and congressional threats are unnecessary to achieve this intellectual sanitation work; our educational system and mass media, institutions that internalize the emotional and ideological needs of the nation, do most of the heavy lifting.


<p>Rummy's 'anniversary'


<p>A good recent example of this cleansing of history is the way we're talking about Iraq and Saddam Hussein these days. The Bush administration reminds us that Saddam killed hundreds of thousands of his own people, and that he has used chemical weapons. The media faithfully repeat this account, which is true as far as it goes. There's more to the story, however.

<p>According to an Associated Press tally, Saddam killed an estimated 190,000 Kurds between 1983 and 1988, a period when he enjoyed economic and military support from the United States.

<p>In fact, it was 20 years ago yesterday [Dec. 20] that a Reagan administration special envoy named Donald Rumsfeld went to Baghdad to begin the process of restoring diplomatic relations with Iraq. (There's even video footage of Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam.) Washington would go on to help Saddam pay for his war against Iran with loan assistance and aid him in other ways, too.

<p>Our private sector also did its part. The Washington Post and other news organizations have reported that in the 1980s, Saddam's scientists legally obtained the basic ingredients for their biological weapons program from suppliers in the United States and Europe. Baghdad purchased strains of anthrax and botulinum toxin from an outfit in Rockville, Md.

<p>The London Guardian reported that in 1988, Dow Chemical sold pesticides to Iraq despite fears that they might be used to make chemical weapons. And a German publication revealed that the weapons declaration Iraq submitted to the United Nations last December listed 24 U.S. companies--including Hewlett-Packard, Honeywell, and Rockwell--that assisted Baghdad's weapons programs.

<p>While it's true that the Reagan administration expressed unease about Saddam's use of chemical weapons against Iran, it also provided Baghdad with crucial battle-planning assistance, The New York Times reported. A senior defense intelligence official during Reagan's tenure told the Times that "the use of gas on the battlefield by the Iraqis was not a matter of deep strategic concern."

<p>The National Security Archive at George Washington University, which has assembled an impressive collection of government documents detailing U.S.-Iraq relations in the 1980s, argues that it was realpolitik, not moral considerations, that determined U.S. policies during the years when Iraq was actually using chemical weapons.

<p>Saddam's chemical warfare, the archive says, appeared to trouble Washington only insofar as it represented "a potentially embarrassing public relations problem that complicated efforts to provide assistance" to Iraq. The archive concludes that the United States was chiefly concerned "with its ability to project military force in the Middle East, and to keep the oil flowing."

<p>Which raises the question: Did the current Bush administration--which includes several officials from the Reagan White House (e.g. Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Elliot Abrams)--really care all that much about punishing Saddam for his crimes against humanity, or was this a minor factor in the decision to invade Iraq?

<p>That's a question for historians to grapple with in coming years. But one thing's for certain: The administration's moralistic rhetoric fits perfectly with the emotional needs of the nation, and with America's mythical narrative about itself. That narrative allows us to congratulate ourselves for tracking down a monster such as Saddam, but requires that other things stay tucked away in the rat holes of history.
