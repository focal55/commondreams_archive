<p>Where else can we turn for balanced, reasoned discussion of the decline of Democracy in America since the "war to end all wars" than the editorial pages of newspapers?

<p>No where is the decline of newspaper journalism in America more evident than in general public ignorance of what the Nation spends on preparation for its wars than spending for education of Democracy's children. 

<p>How many readers of newspapers know that military spending will surpass spending on education in 2003 -- $396 billion compared to $300 billion? Is this what we remaining survivors of the greatest generation fought and died for?   

<p>How many readers of newspapers know that two of five white kids and three of five minority kids are dropping out of our failed public school system before 18 years of age? How many are aware that the dropout rate in high schools has almost doubled in 30 years, or that drop outs and children of drop outs are destined to earn

only half the dollar income of graduates the rest of their lives?

<p>Aren't we as guilty of creating terror in our inner cities as Osama Bin Laden? And what of the futures of the children of Democracy who have been attracted to military service before learning any other trade or skill?

<p>Can members of Congress -- with only three of their children  in the armed forces today -- really justify a standing army of 1.5 million of other people's children to fight in the name Democracy on foreign shores? American children have fought 20 undeclared wars since Korea.

<p>Can we justify spending 26 times more of America's treasury than the combined military spending of the proclaimed "rogue states" of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Libya? Where are the modern editorialists that would tell us that history is replete with examples of despot rulers that build large armed forces are destined to use them?

<p>Must we stand helplessly by on the home front while economic theorists in Washington strip the heartland of good paying jobs exported to  the cheapest labor pools in the world? Are we condemning public school dropouts to lifelong poverty levels created by a private school warrior class in Washington?

<p>How can we educate the world to Democracy as almost half of America's kids drop out of an education system paralyzed by local teacher unions in 15,000 disparate school districts? 

 

<p>Can teachers and their unions reform themselves?

 

<p>Expecting teachers earning $42,000 a year in 10-month school years, and seven hour days is asking the foxes to run the hen houses. Half of kids that enter the ninth grade never see the twelfth. 

 

<p>America's newspaper editors have an awesome responsibility to Democracy. 

 

<p>The choice between spending $400 million of general revenues on education on the home front or endless terror and foreign interventions in the name of Democracy must be be brought to the front burner of public consciousness.

 

<p>Until that issue is addressed by newspapers, Democracy is in mortal danger.
