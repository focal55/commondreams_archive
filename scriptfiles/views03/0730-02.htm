<p>If anyone even suggested publicly the idea of putting a bounty on the 
head of a Bush Administration official you can bet they'd at least be 
jailed on felony charges promptly. Yet incredibly, the Bush 
administration initiated (and then cancelled in the face of immediate 
opposition) a scheme that would have provided financial incentives for 
would-be terrorists to assassinate political leaders in the Middle East 
-- the "Policy Analysis Market," or PAM.

<p>A graphic on PAM's <a href="http://policyanalysismarket.org" target="_new">website</a> <http://policyanalysismarket.org> on Monday 
displayed several hypothetical futures contracts. Investors could bet on

the likelihood that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be 
assassinated or Jordan's King Abdullah II overthrown. One less violent 
investment apparently was suggested -- the U.S. recognizing Palestine as

a political entity. Those hypothetical investments were promptly taken 
off the website, but were archived at <a href="http://www.ReclaimDemocracy.org/pam.html" target="_new">ReclaimDemocracy.org/pam.html</a> 
<http://reclaimdemocracy.org/pam.html>.


<p>The Pentagon office that devised PAM, the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA), said PAM arose from research "to investigate 
the broadest possible set of new ways to prevent terrorist attacks."

<p>While cynics might attribute truly murderous intent to the Bush 
administration, another explanation is the preponderance of extreme 
market ideology, whereby President Bush and company believe capitalism 
is the answer--regardless of the question. It's reflected in the 
administration's position that Iraq should open its oil industry to 
foreign investment before a permanent government is in place. In other 
words, ensure corporate profit-making opportunity first--then we can 
discuss democracy after.

<p>In a statement released Monday, DARPA asserted that markets could reveal

"dispersed and even hidden information. Futures markets have proven 
themselves to be good at predicting such things as elections results; 
they are often better than expert opinions."

DARPA partnered with two corporations to launch the PAM prototype: Net 
Exchange*, a market technologies company, and the Economist Intelligence

Unit, an arm of The Economist magazine.

<p>Senator John Warner, R-Va., of the Senate Armed Services Committee 
announced on Tuesday that PAM would be cancelled -- just hours after 
many Americans first learned of the plan in their morning newspapers. 
DARPA already has admitted to spending $600,000 of taxpayers' money on 
the scheme. The Bush administration had sought $8 million for PAM 
through 2005.

<p>PAM proposed to let traders buy and sell futures contracts just like 
commodities, but the contracts would be speculating on events in the 
Middle East. These events could have included economic trends, wars, 
even assassinations and terrorist attacks. Traders believing certain 
events would occur could buy a futures contract; those thinking the 
event unlikely could sell theirs. The site had planned to register 
investors, who supposedly could sign up anonymously this Friday.

<p>The bottom line: one could bet big money that a certain person would 
die, and then guarantee that investment. "This appears to encourage 
terrorists to participate, either to profit from their terrorist 
activities or to bet against them in order to mislead U.S. intelligence 
authorities," said Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.)

in a letter to John Poindexter, the director of the Terrorism 
Information Awareness Program. Yes, this is same John Poindexter who was

convicted on felony charges for lying to Congress, fraud and conspiracy 
as part of the Reagan Administration's Iran-Contra conspiracy. His 
conviction subsequently was dismissed on grounds that he should have 
enjoyed immunity from prosecution.

<p>Announcement of the program's termination should be treated with 
cautious optimism. Recall that after public and multi-partisan outrage 
led DARPA to cancel the truly Orwellian "Total Information Awareness" 
program, it resurfaced shortly thereafter as the less alarmingly titled 
Terrorism Information Awareness. According to DARPA's Web site, 
"Previously known as Total Information Awareness, this name created in 
some minds the impression that TIA was a system to be used for 
developing dossiers on U.S. citizens."

<p>Name changed, problem solved, right? You'd think they'd at least feel 
obliged to change the acronym.

The Bush administration has continually employed the strategy of tossing

out the most outrageous ideas with the aim of making subsequent, 
slightly less offensive ideas seem moderate by comparison.

<p>After the administration's Domestic Security Enhancement Act 
<http://reclaimdemocracy.org/civil_rights/patriot_act_ii_oped.html> -- 
widely dubbed "<a href="http://reclaimdemocracy.org/civil_rights/patriot_act_ii_oped.html" target="_new">Patriot Act II</a>" -- was leaked to the public in February 
and promptly derided as an outrageous assault on Americans' freedoms, 
Attorney General John Ashcroft quickly backpedaled from the draft 
legislation. But just months later, there was Ashcroft, asking Congress 
to enact substantial portions of the act, which he had earlier dismissed

as nothing more than discussion notes.

<p>With this administration, even the worst ideas have a way of getting reborn.
