<p>Awarding the first major contract for reconstruction in Iraq to a politically connected American company under restricted bidding procedures sends a deplorable message to a skeptical world. Critics of the invasion often say it was launched for the control of oil and other venal motives, not for the benefit of the Iraqi people or to rid the world of a growing menace. The Bush administration should work hard to dispel that mistaken notion and should bend over backward to avoid reinforcing it. Yet the award of a contract worth up to $680 million to the Bechtel Group of San Francisco in a competition limited to a handful of American companies can only add to the impression that the United States seeks to profit from the war it waged.



<p>Officials cite the need for a speedy start on rebuilding as the chief justification for limiting the initial contracts in Iraq to the small number of American companies that were invited to submit bids. Officials invited companies that they were confident could perform the job and that had personnel with security clearances allowing them to work with classified information. Those are important considerations, but it is hard to believe that the administration could not cast its net wider and solicit bids from a broader array of American companies or from highly capable foreign companies based, say, in Britain or Australia, two staunch allies in the invading force. It is not enough to say that there will be wide-open bidding for subcontracting work and that Iraqis are expected to get many of the jobs. In the battle for world opinion, the top contracts carry the most weight.



<p>Bechtel's contract calls for repairing and rehabilitating things like power plants, electrical grids, water and sewage systems, airports and a seaport. Bechtel is undeniably one of the world's most experienced construction companies and has a long history of doing business in the Middle East. But like virtually all of the big American companies involved in global construction, it has deep and longstanding ties with the power centers in Washington. Bechtel's chief executive serves on the President's Export Council, and a Bechtel director, George Shultz, was secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Such ties make it all too easy to criticize the contract as a payoff to politically favored businessmen. The reconstruction of Iraq needs to be an open, competitive, transparent process.
