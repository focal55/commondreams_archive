<p>Where were you on Sept. 11, 2001? That date has replaced Nov. 22, 1963, for my generation, or Dec. 7, 1941, for an earlier generation. 

<p>My wife and I were in Tuscany, in the idyllic hills south of Sienna, with another Northwest couple, on our first visit to Italy. Our friends have a daughter who lives less than a mile from Ground Zero. As Americans and as parents, we were disoriented, helpless, grief-stricken, worried. 

<p>Bless the Italians, those warm and friendly people. Everywhere we went, people in quiet ways expressed sympathy. Candlelight vigils were held in villages, church bells tolled. 

<p>Our daughter and family were in rural France on a year's sabbatical. Every one of their new friends, and many people they didn't know, sought them out to express condolences. 

<p>Two years later, many of these same people feel we were wrong to invade Iraq; according to international polls, the world is fearful of American power and American intentions. 

<p>How to explain? 

<p>Perhaps two words, with which Americans have little familiarity: invasion, occupation. 


<p>The United States has no recent history of being invaded or occupied. This is not the history of other nations. In addition to those colonized by Europeans (nearly all of Africa and Latin America, much of Asia and the Middle East), others have been invaded and occupied in the 20th century. 

<p>The 20th century was a hundred years of war and, although we were involved in many of them, none brought invasion or occupation of the United States. Hawaii (not yet a state) was bombed in 1941, not invaded, and the attack was on a military base, not a city. 

<p>We have not had the experience of a foreign soldier pointing a weapon at us, demanding submission, entering our home. Our United Nations critics in the Iraq invasion all had intimate and recent experience with invasion and occupation. 

<p>With the invention of aerial bombing, warfare turned increasingly deadly in the 20th century, and set pieces between opposing armies in open ground were replaced by carpet bombing of civilian populations. Some say it began in the Spanish Civil War when German planes bombed Nationalist cities. Certainly, all sides employed it in World War II. The Germans blitzed English cities, the Japanese bombed in China, American and British planes reduced German cities to rubble, we A-bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki and fire-bombed Tokyo. In every case it was civilians, not soldiers, who made up the mass of deaths. 

<p>Regardless of who was at fault, increasingly it was civilians who died. Modern planes and munitions have wreaked a horrible toll on the civilian populations of much of the world ... except us. On Sept. 11, 2001, others sympathized, and remembered their own history. Our losses were small compared to theirs, but the feeling of watching helplessly as airplanes killed innocents was ours in common. 

<p>Many also remembered that America helped rebuild the broken lands after World War II. And for many in these lands, there are strong family ties to America, to sons and daughters who emigrated. 

<p>There was every reason, then, for the world to empathize with us in 2001, and for a brief time we held a magic moment in which we were again seen as human, not a superpower, but a nation of people who had suffered a terrible loss. 

<p>That moment is gone, and international polls show we are feared for what we might do rather than appreciated for what we have done. The split in the United Nations was not an act of pique by "old Europe"; it reflected, to an unfortunate degree, world opinion. 

<p>World opinion has no sympathy for Saddam Hussein. What it has sympathy for, and empathy with, are the ordinary people who are the major casualties of invasions and occupations in the modern age. 

<p>It is easy for people to have this empathy, for they have personal and relatively recent experience with modern warfare's devastation of civilian populations. 

<p>Sept. 11, 2001, was the closest Americans have come to this experience, and for one brief moment it united us in grief with people from all nations, sharing the horror caused by massive deaths of innocent people. 

<p>The further we move from being the victims of this horror to being the inflictors of death and devastation on civilian populations in far-off lands, the more the gap grows again between us and the rest of the world.
