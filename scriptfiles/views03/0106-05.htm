<p>"Hitler," the man said, as millions of Americans listened, "was a sensitive painter. You've got to be aware why people like him. He was such a sensitive man. He was a painter."



<P>Millions heard, but nobody complained, when guest host Roger Hedgecock uttered these words on a recent Rush Limbaugh radio talk show.



<P>Has America suddenly become tolerant of contrary positions? Is it now permissible to say that evil men have complex personalities, with good traits along with the bad?



<P>No way. The reason nobody complained is because Hedgecock didn't say anything offensive, not if his words are taken in context.



<P>Twisting people's words has become a national sport in America. Ask Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. She recently said things about Osama bin Laden that, if taken out of context, could be considered praise.



<P>Hedgecock was one who criticized Murray. He asked his audience how Murray could "praise" bin Laden, "the sworn enemy of this country, the man who has declared war on every American, who would kill Patty Murray if he could.  Where does she get off praising him?"



<P>"This is like saying, 'Hitler was a sensitive painter. You've got to be aware of why people like him. He was such a sensitive man. He was a painter,' Hedgecock said. "Now, no one would get away with that. How is Patty Murray getting away with this about Osama bin Laden?"



<P>What is the "this" to which Hedgecock referred? What did Murray say? How did she "praise" bin Laden? Here's what she said, to students at Columbia River High School in Vancouver, Washington, last month:



<P>"Osama bin Laden has been very, very effective. We've got to ask, 'Why is this man so popular around the world? Why are people so supportive of him in many countries?'



<P>"Well, he has been in many countries that are riddled with poverty. People don't have homes, no sewers, no roads, no schools, no health care, no facilities just to make sure that their daily lives were OK. He's been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building day-care facilities, building health-care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful.



<P>"He's made their life better. We have not done that. We haven't been out in any of these countries helping them build their infrastructure."



<P>Did Murray praise bin Laden? No, she didn't. Did she say he was a good person? No, she didn't. Was she complimentary toward him? No, she wasn't.



<P>What she did do -- and all she did -- was report what is commonly believed about bin Laden in the Arab countries, that he has spent millions of dollars to win over the hearts and minds of poor people by building things they need.



<P>Murray's remarks, twisted by simplistic commentators who want us to believe that bad men are completely bad and good men are completely good, were discussed recently on the Ronn Owens radio talk show here in San Francisco.



<P>One of the conclusions reached on that show was that Murray had completely ignored American generosity, particularly the good done by the Peace Corps.



<P>That may be so, but there are two things wrong with that. One is that the Peace Corps, according to its own Web site, has no workers in any of the Arab nations. The other is that much of America's largesse overseas is in reality a hidden subsidy to America's farmers and arms makers.



<P>If Lower Slobbovia is experiencing a crop failure, for instance, our farmers will tell Congress that we really ought to be helping those people out -- "and, oh, by the way, we have a surplus of grain you might want to buy."



<P>Things are not always what they seem.



<P>The thousands of conservatives who sent Patty Murray e-mails telling her to resign (she's a Democrat) seem determined to wallow in ignorance.



<P>They don't want to know anything about our enemies except that they are "evil."



<P>They want to believe that the people who hate us do so simply because they are evil. Because we Americans are perfect, we could not possibly have done anything to offend them. So they must be evil. Completely evil.



<P>Why would anybody hate us? We are such nice people. So kind. So gentle. So loving. So generous. We're so nice that even our conservatives are compassionate.



<P>We have no faults whatsoever.



<P>Conversely, our enemies have no good qualities whatsoever.



<P>I believe we should learn to think like good police detectives. A good detective tries to understand everything he or she can about a suspect. Is he intelligent, handsome and charming (like Ted Bundy)? If so, does that make him less likely to be guilty, or more likely?



<P>A detective might notice that the suspect's house is very clean. Does that mean he's a fastidious housekeeper, or has he recently cleaned it to get rid of evidence?



<P>Intelligent cops know better than to simply label a person good or bad. They know that a thoughtful and charming person like George W. Bush might have some negative characteristics, or that a mass murderer like Osama bin Laden might have some positive characteristics.



<P>That, I think, is what Murray was trying to get across to those high school kids. If we have to fight for our survival, we should learn all we can about our enemies.



<P>Burying our heads in the sand, ignoring facts that we find unpleasant, might get us killed. We'd better pay close attention to what others are doing, good or bad, if we want to win our "War on Terrorism."



<P>And we also should pay attention to what we do, good or bad.
