<p>I had planned to write about the fun we had the first week of operating our new progressive Web magazine, <a href="http://www.FightingBob.com" target="_new">www.FightingBob.com</a>, but it is hard to think about anything other than President Bush&#039;s unrelenting effort to start a war. I&#039;ll save FightingBob.com for next time.
<p>The farce of homeland security continued as we moved from orange to yellow. Thank you, Tom Ridge! It seems like George &#034;Orwell&#034; Bush has lost his marbles.
<p>If Bush lived here it would be diagnosed quickly as &#034;cabin fever,&#034; but he gets to go to whichever warm-weather military base, naval carrier or military academy he wants to and give the same speech: &#034;They are evil and we are good.&#034;
<p>So it isn&#039;t the winter doldrums. No, it is something worse. Maybe he just wants to prove to Dad and Mom that brother Jeb may be smarter but W is tougher.
<p>This is like watching a bad play with an ever-changing plot. Only the actors remain the same. Can you remember when the administration said we might go to war because Saddam would not permit inspections? When he agreed to inspections, that changed to we would go to war if the United Nations approved because Saddam wouldn&#039;t really allow inspections. Then the administration said we would go to war with or without the United Nations. Next, President Orwell said Saddam must disarm or we would go to war.
<p>When he began to disarm, Tony Blair and our president pouted but recovered quickly.
<p>&#034;Wait a minute,&#034; they said. &#034;If you are going to play the game that way, by permitting inspections and destroying weapons, then we will change the rules again.&#034; Saddam must permit inspections, disarm, leave the country and be tried for war crimes or we will go to war.
<p>Which war crimes? you ask. The one where we armed him with weapons of mass destruction to destroy his neighbor Iran?
<p>As of Saturday, we have a new presidential mission, and I&#039;m not making this up: Bush said we will bomb Iraq to create democracy in Palestine.
<p>I think he is missing his naps.
<p>Millions of people throughout the world view our country as a bigger threat to peace than Iraq, but Britain&#039;s Tony Blair continues to give Churchillian speeches despite the cognitive dissonance.
<p>Bush and Blair. What a pair. They are destroying all the good will built up by both countries since 1941.
<p>Poll after poll shows that the Turkish people oppose the war by 95 percent. Result? The Turkish government gave up a $20 billion to $30 billion bribe from Bush and told us to keep our troops out of Turkey.
<p>Blair&#039;s approval rating is about 38 percent, but the much-maligned president of France is enjoying his highest ratings ever.
<p>Think about it. We are opposed by a clear majority of the world&#039;s population, the governments of Canada and Mexico on our borders, nearly all the South American nations, the Chinese, Russians, Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch and Belgians.
<p>Who is on Bush&#039;s team? Spain and Bulgaria. Where are Andorra, Liechtenstein and Monaco when we need them?
<p>But more troubling than the predictable Bush team&#039;s hawkish reaction is the drumbeat from television. They can&#039;t wait. They see careers to be made standing in downtown Baghdad while missiles rain on the populace. More Wolf Blitzers are in the wings.
<p>&#034;Washington Week&#034; on public television used to offer an interesting perspective, but now the reporter guests chuckle and smile while concluding that &#034;war is inevitable&#034; week after week and offer nary a word about the moral dilemma facing this nation. Can we look in the mirror if we kill thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians - women, children, people in hospitals and nursing homes?
<p>Are we prepared to explain to our grandchildren how bombing civilians was a reaction to 9-11 when there was no connection? I know I don&#039;t want to have that conversation.
<p>Madison East High School held an all-day teach-in on the war. Looking out at those young faces, my mind drifted back to Fort Gordon, Ga., in 1963 as eager young recruits poured in, ready to fight and win the war in Vietnam. That war was going to be quick and easy as well. We had very smart advisers and our forces were superior in every way - or so we were told.
<p>Before you knew what was happening, it became &#034;our&#034; war, &#034;our&#034; prestige, &#034;our&#034; mission to stop communism. The names of 57,000 dead young soldiers grace the wall in Washington while hundreds of thousands of injured and millions of dead Vietnamese go unnoticed.
<p>The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best: &#034;War is not the answer.&#034; We were told that if we lost Vietnam, communism would triumph. It hasn&#039;t. Now we are told that Iraq may develop nuclear weapons unless we act. There is another old saying: &#034;Truth is the first casualty of war.&#034;
<p>I have the distinct feeling that I would feel safer with those Madison East students in power than with the Bush administration. They understand who would fight, who would skip out, who would die.
<p>Iremain optimistic that for once in our long history, the people of the world are way out in front of their governments and they will stop this ridiculous war before it begins. The pressure is building. Who knows, maybe even Democrats in Congress will link arms with Robert Byrd and Ted Kennedy and start speaking out for peace.
<p>Call Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, make a picket sign, go to a demonstration. Demand that our leaders lead. This madness must be stopped.
