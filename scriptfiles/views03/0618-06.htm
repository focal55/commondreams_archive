<p>NEW YORK -- Wilbert Rideau's résumé reads like this: named "Person of the Week" by ABC News; called "the most rehabilitated prisoner in America" by Life magazine; codirected documentary film nominated for an Academy Award; given the George Polk Award, one of the highest honors in journalism.

<p>Rideau is 61. Guilty of a brutal killing committed in the aftermath of a hapless bank robbery, he has served 42 years for that crime. Unless a current legal fight - a revealing and truth-distorting struggle - turns his way, he will stay locked up until he dies.

<p>Rideau's story is both unique and symbolic. Across the United States, at least 31,000 state and federal inmates are serving terms of natural life. That means they have been put away forever, without opportunity for parole. Except in the most unusual circumstances, we need never think of them again. And though national support for capital punishment may be softening, this does not mean that fewer people will be sentenced to die in prison.

<p>A decade ago, according to the Criminal Justice Institute, the number of natural lifers was about 12,000. Then, 31 states had adopted the sentence; now, 46 have chosen the safety of permanence and the luxury of not thinking.

<p>Rideau, convicted in Louisiana, a state that pioneered life-without-parole terms back in the 1970s, is a reminder that thought is always necessary. Like the great majority of the 31,000 inmates - a few locked away for minor repeat felonies but most for murder, rape or robbery - he has no claim to innocence.

<p>A ninth-grade dropout, Rideau taught himself on death row at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.

<p>He read all he could, from the Bible he was allowed to the political biographies he had smuggled in. He later became co-editor of The Angolite, the convict-run prison publication, which has, under his leadership, been a finalist for the National Magazine Award seven times.

<p>His book of essays has been praised by Russell Banks in The New York Times Book Review. Because of his near-perfect disciplinary record, he's been allowed to travel, not only around the state to speak with groups like the Boy Scouts, but to Washington to address the American Society of Newspaper Editors.

<p>Promises of jobs in journalism await him if he ever gets out. And past Louisiana prison officials believe he is a threat to no one and deserves release.

<p>"Whatever standard of rehabilitation you pick," C. Paul Phelps, former state secretary of corrections, once said, "Wilbert Rideau exceeds it." In 42 years, he has apparently had just a single infraction, the possession of one contraband item: a bottle of Wite-Out.

<p>But to think back to the woman he murdered, and to her wounded colleagues, is to know that there is nothing easy about his case - or about those of the country's other natural-life inmates.

<p>The nascent shift in perspective on capital punishment in the United States has come, for the most part, through easy moral reckoning, through proof that mistakes have been made and that innocent people have been sentenced to the irrevocable punishment of execution. Any argument against natural-life terms, on the other hand, must rely not on the chance of innocence but on the possibility of rehabilitation despite the hard fact of guilt.

<p>Does the ideal of personal transformation - however infrequently it may be achieved - remain a fundamental value of American society when it comes to criminal justice? The ugly contortions in Rideau's current legal battle suggest that the ideal may not matter at all.

<p>In the rest of the Western world, the desires for retribution and permanence - so compelling when one sees through a victim's eyes - do not drive legal policy as they do in the United States. The European Court of Human Rights has suggested that to deny lifers the consideration of change and the chance of parole is "inhuman and degrading," and of the Western European nations, only Britain does. It has all of about 20 such prisoners.

<p>Like America's use of the death penalty, its embrace of the natural-life sentence is seen as alien by almost all the countries that share America's culture and legal heritage. (Tellingly, death penalty opponents in the United States have been vocal advocates of life without parole, as though to supply a substitute answer to the acute American need for vengeance and finality.)

<p>Were America to do away with the natural-life sentence, 31,000 convicts would not come flooding out from penitentiaries. Most, depending on how laws were rewritten, would have mandatory minimums of decades to serve before they could be even considered for parole. And most would be turned down, periodically, forever.

<p>But rightly, some like Wilbert Rideau - a ruthless and ignorant killer at 19; a deeply wrinkled, deeply educated, deeply self-restrained 61-year-old now - would win a second chance at freedom.
