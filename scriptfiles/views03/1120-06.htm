<p>An impressive committee of leading intellectuals from around the world has joined forces with veterans, clergy, activists and students to challenge the Smithsonian's plans to exhibit the Enola Gay in a way that lends itself to a celebratory view of the plane.  The planned exhibit, set to open December 15 at the Air and Space Museum's new Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport, is devoid of meaningful historical context and of any discussion of the ongoing controversy surrounding the bombings.  Furthermore, the exhibit lacks any information regarding the number of casualties resulting from the atomic bombing.

<p>The "Committee for a National Discussion of Nuclear History and Current Policy" has formulated a powerful statement of principles, which appears on their website: <A HREF="http://www.enola-gay.org" TARGET="_new">www.enola-gay.org</A>. The statement has been circulating in the
activist and academic communities here and abroad, and to the media.   The
statement makes clear that the signatories, who number about 250 now, are not opposed to exhibiting the plane in a fair and responsible manner, but they fear that a "celebratory" exhibit both legitimizes what happened in 1945 and helps build support for the Bush administration's "dangerous new nuclear policies," hence the linkage between past history and current policy.  The list of signers, a who's who of the American intellectual left, include Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, famed writers E.L. Doctorow and Kurt Vonnegut, activist Daniel Ellsberg, celebrity Martin Sheen and renowned folk singer Pete Seeger. A list of signers is available on the website.


<p>The <A HREF="http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/releases/110703.htm" TARGET="_new">Smithsonian recently responded to the statement of principles</A> and defended it's decision to exhibit the plane by arguing that the text and plaque used to describe the B-29 is exactly the same kind used for other aircraft in the museum. The Smithsonian's response indicated that 300,000 man-hours were dedicated toward restoring the aged bomber.  The museum notes, "In the end, the Enola Gay played a decisive role in World War II. It helped bring the war to an end in that after the bombing of Nagasaki, shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, surrendered unconditionally."

<p>This kind of assertion galvanizes the academic opponents who are driven to dispel this deep-seated contention.  In fact, military historians point to thousands of historical manuscripts, among them the memoirs of Admiral William D. Leahy, who was Truman's Chief of Staff.  Leahy wrote, "The use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender."  Even the famed warhawk Major General Curtis Lemay said flatly that the atomic bomb "had nothing to do with the end of the war." Many historical figures, including Eisenhower, MacArthur, Nimitz and Halsey were opposed to using the bomb and dispel its contribution toward ending the war.


<p>Opponents of the planned exhibit decry the "seemingly celebratory nature" of the Enola Gay exhibit and point to the <A HREF="http://www.smav.si.edu" TARGET="_new">Air and Space Museum website</A> <http://www.smav.si.edu> that invites 4,000 aviation veterans on December 9, to a sneak preview of the hangar that will display 200 aircraft and 140 spacecraft. The controversial site displays a photo of the new complex about 25 miles west of Washington and a prominent photo of just one of it's many exhibits, The glistening Enola Gay, parked beneath a huge American flag. Committee members are working with local Washington-area activists to promote a variety of efforts.  Links on the website <A HREF="http://www.enola-gay.org" TARGET="_new">www.enola-gay.org</A> describe "Related events sponsored by other organizations."


<p>In fact, several groups in the local activist community have been busy organizing events. Karen O'Keefe, a Washington attorney and volunteer with the <A HREF="http://www.dawndc.net" TARGET="_new">D.C. Antiwar Network</A>, <http://www.dawndc.net> says about 15 DAWN volunteers are working on opposing the Enola Gay exhibit in a creative, nonviolent fashion. "We are sending emails to editorial writers nationwide, distributing flyers to members of Congress, advertising the website nationally and alerting the embassies to get out the word about this exhibit."


<p>Thousands of Japanese and people around the world have signed an angry petition demanding that General John Dailey, Director of the Air and Space
Museum, rethink the exhibit. The petition states in part,   "We cannot
repress our deep astonishment and anger. What the Enola Gay wrought was the loss of well over 100,000 lives that were cruelly destroyed by the atomic bomb, and the deep wounds and radiation-induced handicaps that continue to afflict victims of the atomic bomb to this day. Of the 140,000 people estimated to have died in Hiroshima within that year, 65% were women, children and elderly people who had no connection to the war. To exalt this Enola Gay - which caused an unprecedented atrocity that violated all norms of morality and international law - as a testimony to "technological achievement" is completely unacceptable to the atomic bomb victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."

<p>On Saturday, December the 13th, Committee members are planning to hold a conference in Washington in Kay Chapel at American University.  Several renowned scholars, including Paul Boyer, Herbert Bix, Natalie Goldring, Robert Jay Lifton, Sy Hersh, Lawrence Wittner, Gar Alperovitz, and Kai Bird, have indicated their willingness to participate.

<p>On Sunday, December 14, a <A HREF="http://www.enola-gay.org/action/prayer_service.pdf" TARGET="_new">special liturgy will be held</A> at the historic New York Avenue Presbyterian Church near the White House. <http://www.enola-gay.org/action/prayer_service.pdf> The service will feature a film showing the devastation caused by the bomb dropped by the Enola Gay.  Several hibakusha, Japanese radiation victims who were terribly scarred and continue to suffer from the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, will be in Washington and are scheduled to speak at the conference and the service and will share their reaction to the exhibit on December 15.

<p>The Committee's Statement of Principles, the bantering back and forth with the Air and Space Museum, along with the academic conference and the solemn liturgy, will build toward a demonstration being organized by the Enola Gay Nonviolent Action Committee, comprised of members from the Dorothy Day Catholic Worker House in Washington and others.  The Catholic Workers plan a solemn demonstration in front of the Enola Gay at 11:00 a.m. on the day of the museum's opening, Monday, December 15.  Kathy Boylan of the Catholc Worker House invoked the words of Roman Catholc Pope Paul VI who described the bombing as "a butchery of untold magnitude."  Ms Boylan said the purpose of the demonstration is "to express our outrage at the Enola Gay being displayed without reference to the human suffering inflicted."  Plans call for demonstrators to congregate near the plane.  Demonstration planners say the Smithsonian won't address the suffering unleashed by the Enola Gay -- so they will.
