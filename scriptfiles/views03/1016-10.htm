<p>GOV.-ELECT Arnold Schwarzenegger promised to discuss his past sexual misconduct once the election was over. Yet, at a recent post-victory conference, he dismissed reporters' questions by saying these incidents were simply "old news." 

<p>While we wait -- don't hold your breath -- we might reconsider what it means to "behave badly" toward women. 

<p>What Schwarzenegger allegedly did was to humiliate women by treating them as sexual objects which are always available for a feel or a grope. 

<p>The media instantly dubbed his misconduct as "sexual harassment," which it was sometimes (when it happened on movie sets). Sexual harassment usually refers to a hostile work environment created by a supervisor who demands unwanted sexual attention or favors from employees. 

<p>But Schwarzenegger did more; he apparently groped everywhere he went. He ambushed unsuspecting women in restaurants, at parties and all kinds of social occasions, not only at work. 

<p>Why, ask many people, didn't these 15 women in the Los Angeles Times' stories complain or file a legal suit? For the same reason that most women, before Anita Hill's testimony against U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, never thought to complain about sexual harassment at the office. "That's life," they felt. "You just put up with it or you get fired." 

<p>Many women now are recalling similarly humiliating experiences about which they "never made a fuss." To their friends, they are revealing how they, too, were touched inappropriately or groped and fondled by strangers. And, they are extremely angry that they never said anything. 

<p>In the 1970s, the women's movement redefined many "customs" as crimes. Wife beating became battering and domestic violence. Sexual blackmail at the workplace became sexual harassment. Coercive sex on a date became date rape. Coercive sex in marriage became marital rape. 

<p>We need to name the sexual injury that involves groping and fondling. The California Penal Code calls it sexual battery and says it occurs when "any person touches an intimate part of another person, when the touching is against the will of the person touched, and is for the specific purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification, or sexual abuse. . .." (It is also a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $2,000, or by imprisonment in a county jail for up to six months or both.) 

<p>Sexual battery is not an act of seduction. It is a raw act of invasion and domination. It is not adultery or consensual sex between two willing adults, nor is it "playful behavior," as Schwarzenegger called it. 

<p>And, it's not funny, as the sycophantic Jay Leno imagined when he joked, "Six women have come forward that say Arnold Schwarzenegger groped them without their consent. This proves he would be a hands-on governor." 

<p>History tells us that the men accused of sexual misconduct are usually believed and acquitted in court or by the public -- at least, at first. This was certainly true when Clarence Thomas, William Kennedy Smith and O.J. Simpson were respectively accused of sexual harassment, date rape and battering. Afterward, growing numbers of women came forward and revealed similar experiences. A few years later, public opinion began to change. 

<p>Still, sexual battery will only end when enough women respond to groping with indignation, rather than humiliation. We are not helpless victims. When fondled, we can say, in an extremely loud voice, "Get your hands off of me." That should stop serial gropers who won't risk being humiliated.
