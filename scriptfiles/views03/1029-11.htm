<p>Back in the early 1970s, my wife and I went to a Green Bay Band concert at St. James Park. We sat on park benches to enjoy the performances on a perfect summer evening. 

<p>The orchestra members were introduced one by one until they introduced the tympani player, legendary Otto Kaap, famous for his nearly 70-year old Washington Street restaurant, a popular stopping place for the shoppers and shopkeepers who seemed to be nearly as numerous in our bustling downtown of the past as the buffalo on the Great Plains. Otto got a standing ovation. 

<p>Later that week, I visited my mother, then about 65 years old, and told her about Otto’s standing ovation. She was surprised. “Poor Otto Kaap,” she said. “During World War I, they threw eggs at him and at his store and called him names, and then they did the same thing during World War II. What a turnaround of history that he got a standing ovation.” I asked why he was egged and Mom said, “He was German.” Because Mom was of German descent on both sides, this did not sit well with her or her parents. 

<p>Otto Kaap, like so many Germans, left his homeland to avoid military conscription. That he was German was twisted by those caught up in the nationalistic fervor of the time. Recently, it has been surprising to watch as some with no military service derided veterans who had served their country and who were against the war. Freedom of speech only works if all sides can be heard. 


<p>Others have wigged out on the Dixie Chicks because they had an opinion and expressed it. The reaction was fueled by right-wing radio. How dare we criticize Bush, even though, just a few years ago, we heard unending catcalls about Bill Clinton. What happened to “sauce for the goose?” 

<p>Some people refused to buy French wines, perfume, cars, or take vacations to France. It culminated in the ludicrous “Liberty Fries.” The French naturally retaliated and boycotted our products. We sure showed them! 

<p>I saw emails that ripped the French, saying a Google search for “French Military Victories” turned up zero sites. Actually, it turned up 76,600 sites. Apparently, while working on their cause, the warmongers forgot about our own Revolutionary War (aided by the French), Napoleon, and the Franco-Prussian War. Add to that their joy when the French Securitie blew up the Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior. 

<p>My four brothers and I all served in the military. My father served in the Coast Guard Auxiliary during World War II; my paternal grandfather served in the Spanish-American War, my maternal great-grandfather served in the Civil War. In spite of this background, because I was against attacking Iraq when I knew it was a bad idea, for oh-so-many reasons, non-veterans dare to insinuate that I am not a patriot. With no military service, what would they know about the dangers?
