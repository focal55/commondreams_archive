<p>It was at least one good thing amid so much horror: Jessica Lynch's rescue by Special Forces on April 1, 2003. One family could begin to exhale. One person was alive and coming home. Nine members of Lynch's unit, the 507th Maintenance Company, which was ambushed in southern Iraq on March 23, did not survive. It is believed that an Iraqi attorney, whose wife worked in the hospital where Lynch was held, alerted the U.S. military to Lynch's whereabouts. 



<p>It is a remarkable story and has understandably received an enormous amount of press coverage. (Stories of rescue are popular, particularly when the rescuee is female, blonde, young.) But why, we should ask as we celebrate this homecoming, was Lynch put in danger in the first place?



<p>West Virginia, Lynch's home state, has the highest rate of enlistment in the armed services and is, not coincidentally, one of the poorest states in the country. West Virginia tops or comes close to the top of all those per capita lists: fewest people who go to college, fewest people who graduate from high school, fewest women in professional careers, least number of people who speak a language other than English, most young people who smoke, more litigations than any of the surrounding states--and there are six surrounding states. Lynch is from Palestine, a farming town in Wirk County where the unemployment rate is 15%. Shortly before she graduated from high school, she joined the military to make money to pay for college. (West Virginia University, like most public universities, is implementing budget cuts and a tuition hike, almost 10% for the 2003-2004 year.) Because Lynch could not afford to go to college, she ended up, at nineteen years of age, broken in a hospital in southern Iraq. 



<p>And for what, exactly? The liberation of Iraq? The security of the United States?



<p>In William Dean Howells's 1905 short story, "Editha," the eponymous young woman urges her fiancee, George Gearson, to join the war effort. (Although the conflict is unnamed, Howells makes references to the Spanish American

War.) George is reluctant to enlist, having been raised "to think war a fool thing as well as a bad thing." Editha asks him, aware that she is parroting the newspapers, "I call any war glorious that is for the liberation of people who have been struggling for years against the cruelest oppression." After a night of much drinking and government propaganda, George signs up. He is among the first killed. 



<p>The Spanish American War involved people who were fighting for their liberation, and who would be aggressively denied it by the United States. As a result of that war, the United States acquired the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. In December 1898, President McKinley signed the "Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation," which ceded the Philippines to the United States for $20,000,000 and gave American occupiers the right to use force against Filipinos who might be loathe to swap Spanish colonizers for US American ones. (200,000 Filipino civilians were killed during the war.) The United States also managed, amid the smoke, to annex Hawaii and secure a foothold in Guatanomo Bay, Cuba--which would prove useful a hundred years later as a legal nowhereland outside the protections of the Geneva Convention.  



<p>Another result of the Spanish American War was the establishment of the American Anti-Imperalist League in June 1898.  



<p>At the end of the nineteench century, the U.S. government and mainstream press used the explosion of the U.S.S. Maine to garner support for its self-interested, unethical war. Now, the United States government is using the attacks of 9/11 to invade, bomb, and occupy Arab countries. In a vicious bid to secure oil interests, it has turned its citizens into murderers and victims. Unlike Lynch, the United States had many choices prior to this invasion--and it chose to make all of us participate in a massacre. We know the crime. More than a thousand Iraqi civilians have been killed--children dismembered, incinerated, starved; over half a million children have died because of U.S.-led sanctions; doctors are operating on patients with little or no pain medication; people are sick from lack of clean water, or any water at all; more than a hundred U.S. soldiers and we-may-never-know-how-many Iraqi soldiers have died. And the alleged weapons of mass destruction that were the alleged reason for all this have not been found.

<p>Amy Cole of Spenser, West Virginia, traveled to Palestine to visit the Lynch family's home. She wanted to take a picture of her eight-year-old daughter in front of their tree with the yellow ribbon. "We wanted to take pictures so my daughter could take them to school," Cole said. "This gave her a positive twist on war that good things can happen, even in a horrible situation."



<p>Good things do happen in horrible situations. I hope we are also teaching children about the tens of millions of people across the globe who took to the streets, trying to prevent the terror of combat and cluster bombs, and who are continuing to work to make the world genuinely safer.



<p>Jessica Lynch wants to be a teacher. I hope she becomes a great one, a teacher who encourages her students to care about history and to ask needed questions about every story of rescue.</i></p>
