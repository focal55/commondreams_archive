<p> IN A PARTICULARLY seething rant in December about ''weapons of mass destruction,'' President Bush said: 
<P>

   ''We will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes and terrorists to threaten our nation and our friends and allies with the world's most destructive weapons.''
<P>

   ''Weapons of mass destruction pose a grave danger. They could allow America's adversaries to inflict massive harm against our country, our military forces abroad, and our friends and allies.''
<P>

   ''For terrorists, WMD would provide the ability to kill large numbers of our people without warning. They would give them the power to murder without conscience on a scale to match their hatred for our country and our values.''
<P>

   Because of this, Bush said, ''we will pursue robust counterproliferation policies and capabilities to deter and defend against the use of these weapons.''
<P>

   Have we ever. Amid the flaming debate over Iraq, the United States  not only continues to seed the world with conventional weapons of mass destruction but arms contractors are increasingly entering into deals that all but give away US technology.
<P>

   Recent newspaper reports have detailed how American contractors are aggressively pursuing arms sales in India despite the frictions between India and Pakistan, both of which have nuclear weapons programs. ''The potential in this market is significant,'' said Dennys Plessas, a Lockheed Martin vice president, to The New York Times.
<P>

   Another recent New York Times story detailed the growing trend by American defense contractors to offer new goodies to nations that purchase US arms. While Bush has labeled North Korea as one of the nations in his ''axis of evil,'' Boeing has a $4.4 billion contract with South Korea for 40 F-15 fighters. Part of the reason South Korea picked Boeing was because 75 percent of the contract's value comes in Boeing giving enough technical and manufacturing jobs to South Korea to allow that nation to build the fighter itself eventually.
<P>

   Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently criticized the ''old Europe'' of France and Germany, which oppose a US invasion of Iraq. One of the countries he smiles upon in his ''new Europe'' is Poland. One of the reasons is because the government and Lockheed bought Poland's support. The White House will plunder the Treasury for a $3.8 billion, below-market-rate loan to help Poland buy 48 F-16s. According to the Times, that loan is more than all direct loans for military aid to the rest of the world combined for the last decade.
<P>

   In addition, Lockheed offered $3 billion in ''offsets'' in the form of jobs in Poland to build engines for the fighter and parts for commercial US aircraft and to help the nation modernize steel mills and its high-tech sector. The government has defended the deals by saying they need them to ''build influence'' in the region. Critics call it what it is: bribes and corporate welfare.
<P>

   The game of offsets is so widespread that it goes from wannabe powers such as Poland to England, our most staunch ally against Iraq. American contactors are so desperate to keep business going they give offsets even to super-rich Switzerland.
<P>

   In the already unstable Middle East, the United Arab Emirates, which is getting 80 Lockheed F-16s for $7 billion, has an office devoted to offsets. Israel is so good at the game of offsets that it has already developed its own arms from US technology. American contractors end up competing in the arms market against Israeli weapons developed with the help of the United States. 
<P>

   The practice of giving other nations jobs in exchange for contracts has already cost the US economy 4,200 jobs in the last decade, according to the government. Arms analyst William Hartung of the World Policy Institute said the Bush administration does not ''have any principle of restraining arms sales. If anything, it's like a mixture of the Clinton policy that arms are just another export and the Reagan policy of arming favorable warlords. Their whole focus is cutting down on red tape without one thought about if arms ended up in the wrong hands.''
<P>

   Under the guise of ''robust counterproliferation'' against weapons of mass destruction, the United States is using its wealth to put arms and military technology in the hands of just about any nation that claims to be our friend today - with no thought as to who will be tomorrow's axis of evil. Bush says that Saddam Hussein's toxins are the scariest, most unpredictable weapons on the planet. No matter how much he repeats that, he cannot hide the fact that the United States continues to ensure that the world will remain full of weapons that are desired precisely because they are proven to be the most efficient and most reliable weapons of mass destruction on earth.
