<p>Two weeks ago, an Israeli judge rejected my appeal of the decision by Israeli 
security officials to deny my entry to Israel for humanitarian aid work in the 
occupied territories. The judge's ruling followed a cursory hearing that I was 
not allowed to attend. The hearing featured "secret evidence" that I was not allowed 
to see or challenge. Sadly, my case is just one of many demonstrating that, rather 
than curbing government abuses, the Israeli judiciary is largely serving to legitimize 
systematic violations of international law. <p>Israeli security officials have 
labeled me a "security threat," an absurd claim given my record. I strongly oppose 
all violence. I've interned for U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd and for the U.S. 
State Department in Africa; I've earned master's degrees from Yale and Harvard's 
Kennedy School of Government, and I've managed multimillion-dollar humanitarian 
aid programs for 11 years with American nongovernmental organizations in Morocco, 
Egypt, Mali and Gaza. <p>Last fall, the deteriorating Middle East situation led 
me from aid work to more direct human rights and nonviolent work. I volunteered 
with the International Solidarity Movement, helping West Bank Palestinian farmers 
to harvest their olives despite Israeli settler attacks and supporting Palestinians 
and Israelis in peacefully protesting the wall that Israel is building on Palestinian 
land. <p>When I flew to Tel Aviv in March for more human rights volunteering, 
I was held by Israeli police and put on the next flight back to the United States. 
The Israeli authorities justified this treatment based on my involvement in peaceful 
protests and ties with nonviolent human rights groups. <p>So I then accepted consulting 
work with an American aid organization rebuilding damaged Palestinian waterlines 
and replanting razed farmland. But in August I was again turned back by Israeli 
border police when I attempted to enter Israel from Egypt for this work. <p>Though 
many aid and rights workers have been denied entry to Israel, I'm among the first 
to appeal to the Israeli courts. The court's handling of my case reveals the system's 
deep flaws. The judge refused to allow me to travel from Egypt for my hearing, 
even handcuffed and under Israeli police guard. She didn't allow two Israelis 
who were at the hearing, one a rabbi, to testify on my behalf. Instead, she based 
her decision largely on "secret materials" from Israeli security officials. Since 
I did nothing wrong or secret, the materials could only have been errors or distortions. 
But with no knowledge of the materials, we couldn't effectively challenge them. 
<p>Access for humanitarian aid is a key principle of international law. Dubious 
"intelligence" must be balanced against Israel's obligation to give humanitarian 
organizations access to 3.2 million Palestinians living under military occupation. 
Instead, the Israeli judiciary seemingly accepts the security services' claim 
that nonviolent support for Palestinian rights is a security threat. Although 
Israel does need thorough security measures, blocking aid only deepens poverty, 
and crushing the nonviolent movement eliminates peaceful alternatives, threatening 
Israeli security. <p>Tragically, humanitarian access is only one of many areas 
in which Israeli courts sanction violations of international law that fuel Palestinian 
anger. Since 2000, thousands of Palestinians have been jailed for long periods 
based on "classified evidence" and without due process. Following court-approved 
guidelines, the Israeli military has demolished 4,000 Palestinian homes over three 
years in a manner that Amnesty International recently called "excessive, disproportionate" 
and "a grave violation of international human rights and humanitarian law." <p>According 
to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, Israeli courts have accepted 
Israel's takeover of 50 percent of the West Bank and the construction of Israeli 
settlements on Palestinian land, all in violation of international law. Similarly, 
the courts are allowing construction of a "security" wall up to four miles inside 
the West Bank, rather than along the West Bank border with Israel, separating 
tens of thousands of Palestinians from their farmland. <p>With no effective political 
opposition and with a rubber-stamp judiciary, Israeli society has lost its capacity 
for self-regulation. While the international community rightly presses Palestinians 
to end attacks on Israeli civilians, we must also demand that Israel cease its 
assault on Palestinian human rights. The Oslo peace process showed that peace 
for Israelis will not come without respect for Palestinian rights. <p>Engaged 
in a difficult conflict, Israel is blocking outside monitoring when it is needed 
most. Humanitarian aid and human rights workers must be allowed to do their work.
