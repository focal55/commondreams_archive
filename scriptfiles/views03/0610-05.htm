<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair is in trouble. It's a crisis of credibility brought on by the war in Iraq. And while the fate of the leader of a medium-size European country thousands of miles away might seem unimportant in the United States, it could change the whole global balance of power.

<p>For years, Britain has been America's buddy, offering support in Persian Gulf War I, Kosovo, Afghanistan and now Iraq. The military aid has been useful without being essential; the real help was diplomatic. Britain's presence proved that the United States wasn't trying to run the planet on its own.

<p>But thanks to the way Blair has played the last few months, it's unlikely that any British leader could easily follow an American president to war again. In particular, few people here would believe the prime minister, whatever he said about anything.

<p>The crisis is over the weapons of mass destruction - or rather, over the fact that no one has found them yet. This is a marginal issue in the United States, where the Allied victory, the fall of Saddam Hussein and the discovery of mass graves in Iraq have provided all the justification for war - even if the American people thought further justification was needed.

<p>It's a different story in the UK. Blair had real difficulties persuading people that the war was necessary, justified or wise. George W. Bush is usually depicted in Europe as an intellectually challenged, trigger-happy Texan who was not even duly elected. This may be unfair, but it creates a problem for any world leader who wants to follow him, a problem Bill Clinton never posed even at the height of the Monica Lewinsky affair.

<p>Blair's own Labor party had serious misgivings about the war in Iraq; at one point, it looked as if more than half his supporters in Parliament might vote against military action. If they had, he would almost certainly have had to resign and made way for an anti-war prime minister.

<p>The biggest demonstration ever seen in Britain protested the war. These were not the usual left-wing suspects, but included many conservative patriots. "Make tea, not war" was one slogan - not exactly sophisticated geo-politics, but an indicator that the non-protesting classes were out on the streets, often for the first time.

<p>Blair did all he could to convert this middle ground. He would appear anywhere - at public meetings, on television and in Parliament itself to make his case. He sounded more sincere than he ever had on any other issue. On the eve of war he made what most people judge to be his finest speech, with echoes of Winston Churchill in his voice, warning that if Britain "faltered" over Iraq he would resign.

<p>The absolute kernel of his case was the weapons of mass destruction. Biological weapons could be targeted on us "in 45 minutes." He spoke chillingly of Iraq's nuclear capacity. He cited the latest intelligence reports to stress the danger Hussein posed, a peril that would be much greater if we did not address it now. The result was a clear and crucial victory in the vote that followed, and British troops were heading toward Basra the next day.

<p>Now it's payback time. Much of the "intelligence" Blair used as the justification turns out to be possibly flawed and certainly "tweaked" - spun in the direction Blair and his staff wanted it to be. While much of Blair's information did come from genuine intelligence sources, it appears to have been taken out of context and "improved" to make the case stronger. And much of the famous British dossier on Hussein - quoted approvingly by Colin Powell at the United Nations - turns out to have been from a graduate student's paper of 12 years ago, copied from the Internet, misspellings and all.

<p>Most of the blame for this cut-and- paste dossier has been placed on Blair's closest aide, a former tabloid journalist named Alastair Campbell, who believes himself to be a master manipulator of public opinion. The calls for Campbell's dismissal are growing, and his departure would be a thunderous blow to Blair himself.

<p>Possibly the weapons of mass destruction will be found. If not, Blair will be in very big trouble. He dragged an unwilling nation into war by convincing most undecided voters that, on balance, it was necessary. If they become convinced that he exaggerated the facts and bent the data in order to send young men to their deaths in a pointless war, they will be deeply unwilling to believe him again. Blair has always had a reputation of a high-wire walker with the truth. If he topples now, there may be no safety net waiting.

<p>These suspicions that Blair has been at best evasive and at worst mendacious, have badly damaged his standing. Last week, at Prime Minister's Questions, the weekly bear-pit session at which the two main parties go head-to-head in Parliament, he came out the winner, with a bold assertion that he had done nothing wrong and ringing praise for the success of British forces (well, what national leader ever spoke about "our cowardly troops"?).

<p>But he didn't answer the crucial question. If the weapons of mass destruction don't turn up, if it is proved that Blair misled the people and used intelligence reports for political purposes, he might well survive in office for some more years. In a parliamentary system, it's hard to oust a prime minister before an election. That's the way the system works.

<p>But I honestly do not see how Britain could now join in any further U.S. assault on the axis of evil, whether Syria, Iran or even North Korea. If Tony Blair has blown it, you Yanks are on your own. Well, perhaps the government of Fiji will send a "good luck" card.
