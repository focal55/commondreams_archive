<p>HEART DISEASE runs in part of my family. A beloved uncle died at 50 of a heart attack. One grandmother died in her 60s of congestive heart failure; the other of high blood pressure. Others, happily, have lived into their 90s, and I hope I take after them. 

<p>In those years, doctors could do little. There was aspirin for pain, nitroglycerine for temporary relief of ''angina,'' and digitalis to stimulate the heart. That was it. 

<p>But today my fate is not just a matter of diet, exercise, and genetics. There are statin drugs if my arteries tend to clog, several classes of blood pressure medication, and much more. There are elegant diagnostic tests, like the echocardiogram I recently had, where I could both see my heart and its valves on a monitor and listen to the healthy sloshing of my splendid pump. (I'm fine, Mom, this was a routine screening.) And if things ever get bad, there are delicate angio-procedures, valve jobs, triple and quadruple bypasses, even heart transplants. And they all cost a small fortune, from the $10 pills to the $20,000 surgeries. One thing about aspirin, nitrogylcerine, and digitalis: They were dirt cheap. Science keeps inventing ways to keep us alive and well, and all of us expect nothing but the best. 

<p>All of which brings me to the debate about health insurance. There are really two issues here, and they tend to get blurred. The first is how we contain costs. The second is how we cover everybody. Seemingly, the two goals are at odds with each other. 

<p>How on earth do you restrain health costs as the population keeps aging and as science keeps marching on, much less if everyone is insured? One easy solution: freeze the state of science at about 1950, and we could insure everyone in the United States for cheap. But who wants that? 

<p>The fact is that HMOs and the employers who buy most of the insurance can disguise the ugly word all they want, but much of what they do is a form of rationing. They limit available tests, drugs, and procedures. They punish doctors in the pocketbook for spending more than a few minutes with patients. They make the paper chase so complex that many consumers just give up and don't fill the prescription, or they go without the procedure (and the richer among us just pay out of pocket). All of these measures can be politely called managed care or ''alignment of incentives,'' but all are forms of rationing. And unlike true rationing, in which care is based on dire need, wealthier people can always buy their way out. 

<p>We are hearing a lot from the Bush administration that competition is the solution to escalating health costs. You can shop around for a car or a hotel; why not for a health plan? 

<p>The reason is that medicine and health insurance are not ordinary commodities. For starters, most private health plans deny consumers meaningful choices. The whole point is to limit the choice of doctors and hospitals to those who give the plan discounts and follow the managed care company's treatment rules. 

<p>Insurance companies also spend a fortune on marketing (to target consumers less likely to get sick), on claims processing, and on profit. One of the worst sources of inefficiency in the whole system is the cost of the fragmentation that comes from having duplicative and parallel private bureaucracies. 

<p>Every reputable study, including the most recent one from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, shows that the most cost-effective way of spending limited health dollars is through a single universal system, like Medicare. The elderly may be bewildered by the system, but they are no fools. They know that the one oasis of completely secure coverage and fully free choice is conventional Medicare. That is why the Bush administration, despite wanting to herd seniors into HMOs, caved in and agreed to allow (still too skimpy) drug benefits for people who stay with Medicare. 

<p>Here's where the two questions - cost containment and coverage - come together. The best way of cutting avoidable costs (but not cutting care) and also insuring every American is to put everyone in the same universal system. There would still be difficult choices, but nothing like the insecurity, cost-shifting, waste, and profiteering of the present system. 

<p>What stands in the way? Only the insurance industry, the drug companies, the Fortune 500, half the American Medical Association, and the Republican Party. That's all.
