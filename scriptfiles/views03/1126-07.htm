<p>Who does George W. Bush say gave him the power to lock up U.S. citizens without charges or access to lawyers, family or court? Al-Qaida, he says, and a mirage of a nod from Congress.

<p>That's ludicrous. But here's the logic, as presented last week by administration lawyers who argued before an appeals court in Manhattan that it is permissible to hold so-called dirty bomber Jose Padilla indefinitely in a military brig after branding him an "enemy combatant."

<p>On Sept. 11, 2001, "al-Qaida made the battlefield the United States and the evidence indicates that they're trying to make it the battlefield again," said Deputy Solicitor General Paul Clement. And if it's a "battlefield" arrest, Bush can detain anyone alleged to be in league with terrorists, including citizens, for as long as it takes to gather intelligence and deter future attacks. "This is the way it's been done for 200 years in military justice," Clement said.

<p>Fortunately, two of the three judges seemed taken aback by the audacity of that assertion. Judge Barrington Parker Jr. said the power Bush seeks from the court is "breathtaking in its sweep." He's right: The president can not substitute military justice for civil law. The Constitution gives that power to Congress. Clement said Congress did just that in the resolution authorizing Bush to use force in Afghanistan and to prevent future attacks. But no act of Congress contained the words "enemy combatant." 

<p>Brooklyn-born Padilla was taken into custody in Chicago in May, 2002. Officials said he'd met with al-Qaida members abroad and discussed detonating, in the United States, a conventional bomb rigged to disperse radiation. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said at the time that there was no actual plot, "beyond some fairly loose talk." Still, Padilla has been in a military brig for 18 months.

<p>Lawyers arguing on his behalf said Padilla, like any citizen, has the right to a lawyer and an opportunity to challenge the life-altering enemy-combatant designation. The court didn't say when it will rule. But Judge Rosemary Pooler was clear on one critical point: "As terrible as 9/11 was, it didn't repeal the Constitution." It's a message Bush should heed.
