<p>As President Bush continues down his world-defying path toward a virtually unilateral war against Iraq, his father recently offered a subtle caution against so rash an act. Former President George H.W. Bush, in a speech at Tufts University late last month, emphasized the importance of multilateral relationships. Significantly, his example related to Desert Storm, the senior Bush's war against Saddam Hussein 12 years ago. 

<p>He credited the international unity behind Desert Storm with reinvigorating the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians that ultimately led to the 1991 Madrid peace conference. Bush said that conference would never have happened "if the international coalition that fought together in Desert Storm had exceeded the U.N. mandate ... if the United States had gone on its own into Baghdad, after Saddam and his forces had surrendered and agreed to disarm. The coalition would have instantly shattered and the political capital that we had gained as a result of our principled restraint ... would have been lost." 

<p>Wise words, indeed. George, were you listening?
