<p>In "The Library of Babel," one of his many great short stories, Jorge Luis Borges pictures a library as an infinite universe where every possible combination of the alphabet is collected in books. Along with endless volumes of gibberish, every book that has ever been written and every book that ever will be is somewhere on a shelf. Gibberish aside, Borges was imagining every librarian's dream. (He was once the director of the Buenos Aires National Library in Argentina.) Thanks to cyberspace, digital archives and Google, something resembling "The Library of Babel" is here. It only takes an internet connection to Babel on.

<p>What Borges never imagined before he died in 1986 is that no sooner would the infinite library be possible than it would be whittled back to provincial and archaic scale. An ossifying majority of the Supreme Court has just decided that it was not only permissible for public libraries to filter internet access, but required of them to do so. Deciding for individuals what is and what isn't moral is one of those government disorders Americans have trouble sedating. Like Puritans wracked by "the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy" (as H.L. Mencken put it), government tends toward the same fears that someone, somewhere, may glance a dirty picture on the government's dime. But the problem is not nearly so shallow, nor limited to government's obsessions.



<p>Last week I spent a few hours on the Volusia County public library system's computers, which are now all filtered. I was surprised by the sophistication of the software. It's not the crude filtering system it used to be. It blocks out the obvious porn sites, but it tries, it really tries, to let through the stuff deemed "legit."



<p>Complaints typically charged that filters blocked educational sites on breast cancer, sexual dysfunction, art. I freely clicked my way through more such sites than I cared to. And nothing stopped me from reading up on Tracey Cox's "Hot Sex" (apparently a hot seller in France) or putting Barbara Keesling's "The Good Girl Guide to Bad Sex" on my wish list. But the software doesn't just block porn. It's designed to block sites related to "anarchy," chat rooms, "criminal skills" (I had no problem learning how to make an atomic bomb), drugs, gambling, "hate and discrimination," dating, "cults/Gothic," and sites that contain "vulgarity of any sort" or "sites that are adult in nature without being explicitly pornographic." In other words, anything your middle school principal would have busted you for reading about.



<p>Besides the fact that the list is ludicrously broad, it works badly. Sites debating the legalization of marijuana are blocked, religious sites bashing marijuana aren't. Neo-Nazi sites are supposedly blocked, but it's easy to get around the obstacle. Oddly, men's magazine sites such as Maxim's or FHM's were blocked, but Cosmopolitan's equally debasing pages weren't. Heterosexual health sites are generally OK, so are abstinence sites, but gay and lesbian health and "Ann Rose's ultimate birth control" page -- well, they're more likely to flash you the "INAPPROPRIATE WEB SITE" page with its twin icons of a silhouette resembling a cousin of Edvard Munch's screamer, his hand raised to your face like a cop.



<p>I could get an unfiltered computer on request, no questions asked. But that's not the point. Why aren't adults given the option to request a filter instead? To force them to do the opposite is the salient, subtle insult, the assumption that government -- or anyone -- other than the individual choosing to use a public computer decides a priori what is and isn't "appropriate." The effectiveness of the filters isn't the point, either. The presumption of prudery is the problem, and it goes beyond internet filters at your local library.



<p>Congress wrote the filtering law a few years ago allegedly to protect children. But this isn't about protecting children. Computers in children's sections have been filtered all along. It is barely about filters. It's about controls creeping their way through the adult, public sphere. Schools, employers, clubs, even homeowners' associations all have filters of their own on what may be said, done, taught, worn, planted, played, smoked, snorted, grilled, pierced, bared, joked about and, private diaries now being usable evidence to incriminate their author, even thought about. Government is a late-comer in a rather successful national inclination to keep the marketplace of ideas as antiseptic as the neighborhood mall. The internet filter is only the most explicit example of a pervasive national fixation on hunting down the -- all together now -- inappropriate. Porn is just bait for the hunt.



<p>In the end, what gets filtered is exactly the sort of "diversity" this country claims to foster and speak for. Certainly, the United States has fostered diversity very well in various periods over the two centuries. This is just not one of those periods, and filters of any sort, anywhere, aren't improving matters.
