<p>Ha-ha-ha oh man did we ever get smacked on that one. Conned big time. Punk'd 

like dogs. Just gotta shake your head, laugh it off. They reamed us but good, 

baby! Damn. 



<p>Turns out it really was all a big joke after all. The war, that is. All a big 

fat nasty murderous oil-licking lie, a sneaky little power-mad game with you 

as the sucker and the world as the pawn and BushCo as the slithery war thug, 

the dungeon master, the prison daddy. You really have to laugh. Because it's 

just so wonderfully ridiculous. In a rather disgusting, soul-draining sort of 

way. 



<p>See, there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. No WMDs at all. Isn't 

that great? What's more: There never were. Ha-ha-ha. Gotcha! 



<p>No warehouses teeming with nuclear warheads, no underground bunkers packed 

with vats of boiling biotoxins, no drums of crazy-ass chemical agents that 

will melt your skin and turn us all into drooling flesh-eating zombies

-- 

unless, of course, you count the sneering vat of conservative biotoxin that 

is, say, Fox News, in which case, hell yeah baby, we gotcher WMDs right here 

beeyatch. 



<p>Go figure. Those lowly U.N. inspectors were right after all. Who knew? It was 

all a ruse. We've been sucker-punched and ideologically molested and 

patriotically sodomized and hey, what the hell, who cares anyway, we 

"liberated" an oppressed people most Americans secretly loathe and fear and 

don't understand in the slightest, even though that was never the point, or 

the justification, or the goal. Go team. 



<p>But wait, is liberation of a brutalized and tormented people now the reason? 

The justification for our thuggery? That is so cool! So that means we're



going to blow the living crap out of Sri Lanka and Sudan and Tibet and North 

Korea and about 47 others, right? Right? Maybe Saudi Arabia, too, second only 

to the Talilban itself in its abuse of women? Cool! As if. 



<p>Ah, but screw the liberal whiny peacenik U.N. inspectors, right? Let's ask 

the U.S. search teams themselves, ShrubCo's own squadrons of biologists,



chemists, arms-treaty enforcers, nuclear operators, computer and document 

experts and Special Forces troops who've been in Iraq for weeks now, 

searching frantically. 



<p>Surely they've found something, right? Surely we can now prove that Saddam 

was fully intending to fillet our babies and annihilate Florida and poke the 

eyes out of really cute kittens on national TV for sadistic pleasure, right? 

Gimme a hell yeah! 



<p>Whoops. Bad news. As The Washington Post reports, the 75th Exploitation Task 

Force, the very serious-minded group heading up all U.S. inspections in Iraq, 

the group absolutely certain it would immediately find steaming neon-lit



stockpiles of WMDs piled right next to Saddam's personal stash of gay porn 

and Britney Spears posters and opium pipes, is coming home with its tail



between its legs. Found nothing. Nada. 



<p>Psychopatriots are a little nonplussed. Bush is merely "embarrassed." Peace 

advocates are sighing and drinking heavily. We have done this ghastly 

horrible inane hate-filled entirely unprovoked thing in the name of power and 

petroleum and military contracts and strategic empire building, our nation is 

numb and more bitterly divisive than ever and our leaders are not the 

slightest bit ashamed. 



<p>But of course you're not the slightest bit shocked. You knew it all along. 

The WMD line was just a ploy that, tragically, much of the nation bought into 

like a sucker pyramid scheme after being pounded into submission with hammers 

of fear and Ashcroftian threats and bogus Orange Alerts and having their



tweezers confiscated at the airport. 



<p>And of course the capacity to be outraged and appalled has been entirely



drained out of you, out of this nation, replaced by raging ennui and sad



resentment and the new fall season on NBC. This is what they're counting on. 

Your short attention span. WMDs? That's so, like, last February. Hey look, 

the swimsuit model won "Survivor"! 



<p>Because now it's all done. Like a bad trip to the dentist where your routine 

cleaning turned out to be a bloody excruciating root canal and 50 hours of 

high-pitched drilling and $100 billion in god-awful cosmetic surgery, now the 

bandages come off. Smile, sucker. We're at peace once again. Sort of. But not 

really. Don't you feel better now? No? Too bad. No one cares what you think. 



<p>It's all over but the shouting. And the screaming. And the endless years of 

U.S. occupation in the Middle East, the quiet building of U.S. military bases 

in Iraq so we can keep those uppity bitches Syria and Egypt and Lebanon in 

line, forge ahead with the long-standing plan to strong-arm those damn 

Islamic nuts into brutal compliance with Bushco's bleak blueprint for World 

Inc. What, too bitter? Hardly. 



<p>Should we care that Osama, the actual perp of 9/11, is still running around 

free? That terrorism hasn't been quelled in the slightest? That the Mideast 

is more of a U.S.-hating powder keg than ever, thanks to BushCo? That the 

economy is in the worst shape it's been in decades? 



<p>Should we care that we just massacred tens of thousands of Iraqi (and 

Afghani) civilians and soldiers and suffered a little more than 100 U.S.



casualties and have absolutely nothing to show for it except bogus force-fed 

pride and this weird, sickening sense that we just executed something 

irreparable and ungodly and karmically poisonous? 



<p>Nah. Just laugh it off. Have a glass of wine, make love, go play Frisbee with 

the dog. Breathe deep and focus on what's truly important and try to 

assimilate this latest atrocity into your backstabbed worldview, add it to 

the list of this lifetime's spiritual humiliations, as you wait for the next 

barrage, the imminent announcement that we're about to do it all again. 



<p>Steel yourself. Protect your soul. Because man, they reamed us good. Slammed 

this nation like a bad joke. Gotcha! Ha-ha-ha.
