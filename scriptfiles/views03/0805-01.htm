<p>Many times this past year I walked out my front door to a nearby intersection to stand for two hours at a time holding a sign. Sometimes the sign said “peace,” sometimes “jobs not bombs,” Saturday it will say “bring ’em home.” 

<p>During the winter it was cold standing there for two hours, once I wore three layers of gloves and still got numb fingers. Perhaps on the 58th anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki, it will thunder and lightening as it is doing now or maybe it will just be hot and sunny, requiring liberal applications of sunscreen in these days of disappearing ozone and melanoma. 
I’ve been asking myself what is my motivation – why am I compelled to stand there holding up a sign? What can such a desperate, foolish act possibly accomplish against policies that carry neither shame nor consequence. Evidently, no lie is considered too big to use, and no life is so precious that bloodshed might be avoided. 

<p>Many of the people I stand with are my elders. They’ve seen a lot in their sixty, seventy, or eighty-eight years. I listen carefully when words such as “everything my parents worked for is being destroyed” are spoken. 

<p>These words come back to me every day as I read about precarious pensions, disappearing jobs, the elimination of remedial reading programs in schools, and as the costs continue to rise for the illegal and unnecessary occupation of Iraq. All this was predictable and in fact was predicted by the voices speaking out for peace and justice across this country. 

<p>By standing out with a sign we confront our community with truth. We create the space for people to feel that they can pick up a sign too. Many have done so, as the millions marching to prevent this war showed. People united to object to the Bush administration’s destructive gangster-like policies. 
At my first vigil, I picked up my sign with a sense of relief that I was able to do something concrete, visible and constructive to give articulation to my outrage. I could say NO loud and clear to the public at large. I could express my concern at the road the country had traveled in the wake of the unchallenged, stolen election of 2000. 

<p>Those of us who hold our constitution and our democracy dear hoist those signs out of love and with hope. We hope that America may yet be pulled out from the abyss we are fast sinking into–an abyss where the bottom is an expression of hate-filled violence that causes unbearable suffering. 

<p><i>Thea Paneth, a peace activist and mother in Arlington, Mass. will be holding a sign on Saturday, August 9th from 10am to 12 Noon at one of two peace and justice vigils in the Boston area (intersection of Mass. Ave and Route 16 on the Cambridge/Arlington line and at the Mass. Ave. and Columbus Ave. intersection in Roxbury). </i>
