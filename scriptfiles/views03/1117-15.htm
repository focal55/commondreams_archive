<p>My grandfather, a staunch Republican from the Herbert Hoover generation, despised FDR with the same passion shown by the Clinton-haters of the 1990s. He had a full-time steady job with the railroads during the Depression and so had little empathy toward the "welfare" granted to workers in the Works Progress Administration. 

<p>He also thought it pure foolishness that we should allow women the right to vote, an opinion that got him metaphorically and actually slapped more than a few times by my equally opinionated grandmother. He was a World War I veteran, a decent and honorable man, and I did love him dearly.

<p>With that kind of philosophical base he might be assumed to have held an equal distaste for paying taxes. Not true, not true. Something in his upbringing (bless my good-natured great-grandfather!) did not allow him to cross that once- emphatic line between pure selfishness and civic responsibility. 

<p>He told me one time, when I was far too young to grasp his meaning, that I would be grateful for the day I complained about paying taxes. That when that day came, I would be considered well-off and should gladly do my part to support my country, its military, its railroads and infrastructure. He truly believed that paying taxes was one's civic duty and that it would be unseemly and em- barrassing to yammer or whine about it.

<p>Contrast that man, that generation, with our leaders of today, and with my baby boomer cousins. We're spoiled rotten, we whine like nobody's business, and we want almost everything without having to pay for it. 

<p>If that sounds extreme, consider the current tax policies of this country and the proposal to eliminate the estate tax forever. The unadulterated selfishness at the core of the repeal of the estate tax is perhaps the most visible example of the pendulum swung beyond gravity's reach.

<p>If the repeal of the estate tax goes through, it means that some spoiled little rich kid could inherit $50 million and never ever pay a single dime toward the needs of this country. He could invest it all in municipal bonds, or some stock that pays dividends (aren't we repealing that, too!) and never have to do his civic duty or contribute to the common good. 

<p>Although I agree that we should allow some generous portion of a family's estate to be inherited tax-free, are we really that gung-ho on giving the richest families a complete and total free pass in this life? Is there no decency or sense of responsibility among our elite? 

<p>In 1966, corporations paid about 33 percent of the nation's total taxes. The wealthiest taxpayers were taxed at a progressively higher rate that peaked out at 55 percent in 1970. 

<p>The distribution of the tax-paying pie shifted dramatically in these last 30 years, with corporations now paying about 11 percent of the total tax burden and the wealthiest taxpayers enjoying ever-lower real tax rates, capital gains reductions, dividend repeals, and a host of other perks. We have shifted the burden to the working class and to the next generation as a massive debt.

<p>What is very interesting about tax policy is what it says about the generation that promulgates it. This generation of politicians, and yes, all of us, as well, continue to want something for nothing. We bring out tired old arguments about the rich paying more taxes than anyone else yet we never complete that thought with the reality that they own more of this country's wealth than at any time since robber baron days. 

<p>The rest of us who are not rich continue to feed into this malarkey by adopting wildly inaccurate delusions of grandeur. Do we really believe that we can demand more and more services and pay less and less for it? Do we still believe that the estate and capital gains taxes really affect the average middle- and even upper-middle-class taxpayer? My goodness, but we're gullible.
<p>My father's was the Great Generation. My grandfather's was the first to live and die in an industrialized world. They all knew sacrifice, duty and civic responsibility. Our generation may go down as the first one in America's history to receive a dishonorable epitaph from its children. We may ultimately be known as the "Pass the Buck" generation. 
<p>If Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins continue to support policies for the very rich while representing a very poor state, they may find themselves being scolded by the ghost of my grandfather.
