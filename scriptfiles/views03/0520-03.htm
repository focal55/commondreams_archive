<p>CHICAGO - The Bush administration's claims that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are starting to sound about as convincing as O.J.'s effort to find the real killer. 

<p>It's been two months since we went to war to prevent Saddam Hussein from terrorizing us with these armaments, and we haven't found a single warhead, artillery shell, barrel or refrigerator containing his vile creations. What would Johnnie Cochran make of that? 

<p>The best the U.S. government has been able to do is locate a couple of trailers that military specialists thought were mobile laboratories for making biological agents. But by the end of last week, the Pentagon was abandoning that claim. 

<p>As embarrassments go, this one is in a league with having your pants fall down on Main Street at high noon. In his State of the Union address, the president managed to give the impression that Mr. Hussein had piles of the stuff reaching to the sky. That was why we had to act immediately. 

<p>Mr. Hussein, we were told, had 25,000 liters of anthrax - "enough to kill several million people." He might have had 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin, good for several million more dead. He might have manufactured 500 tons of poison gas. He had "upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents." If he had all the weapons President Bush reported, Stevie Wonder ought to be able to find them. 

<p>But the administration was either incompetent or dishonest in the claims it made about Iraq's unconventional weapons - claims that were the paramount excuse for the war. Some of the information was exposed as bogus even before the invasion began. Once we were inside Iraq, though, it was assumed we'd be knee-deep in smoking guns. But we haven't found any, and there are two plausible explanations - neither of which casts a flattering light on Donald H. Rumsfeld and company. 

<p>The first possibility is that by the time we got there, Iraq had no significant caches of forbidden armaments. Maybe it didn't have many to start with, or maybe it destroyed them before U.N. weapons inspectors arrived, to escape detection. 

<p>Has anyone noticed that this demolishes the case for war? If Mr. Hussein had only negligible stocks, he was in no position to use them against us or anyone else. If he was so spooked that he poured everything down a rat hole rather than get caught, we obviously could have defused the threat by keeping inspectors in Iraq permanently. 

<p>But there's an even worse possibility. Mr. Hussein may have had numerous unconventional weapons that were spirited away in the chaos of the last two months. In terms of winning rapidly with minimal American bloodshed, the Pentagon war plan was superb. But it had a huge omission: finding and securing suspected weapons sites. And that should have been an even higher priority than reaching Baghdad. 

<p>The Defense Department says only 200 personnel were assigned to the task. It took weeks for this small team to get to many of the most worrisome facilities. By then, most of the sites had been looted, and any useful evidence destroyed, leaving a whole lot of nothing for us to find. 

<p>One result is to confirm the belief of foreign critics that the United States deliberately misled the world to justify a misbegotten crusade - using weapons of mass distraction, you might say. What has emerged so far has made it look as though Mr. Bush was the one lying about Iraq's weapons, not Mr. Hussein. 

<p>But that only hurts our reputation. The real danger is to our security. Chemical and biological agents may very well have been stolen, wrapped in Christmas paper, and given to our enemies. By now, anthrax or sarin gas could be in the custody of Iraqis who are bent on violently resisting the U.S. occupation. Or they could be the prized possession of al-Qaida. 

<p>Wait - it gets worse. The Washington Post reports that seven nuclear facilities in Iraq have been pillaged. 

<p>"The Bush administration fears that technical documents, sensitive equipment and possibly radiation sources have been scattered," it says. "Some of the containers that held radioactive sources ... are missing." 

<p>That's right: Material that could be used to make a "dirty bomb," or even a nuclear device, may be up for grabs. 

<p>Before the war, Mr. Hussein's arsenal was hidden away under the tightest control, and he didn't dare use it. Today, the nastiest stuff he owned could be in the hands of Osama bin Laden and his confederates, who will use anything they can get. Are you feeling safer?
