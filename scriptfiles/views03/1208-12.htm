<p>"Calling all cars, we have an ALL POINTS BULLETIN!  Be on the lookout for an African American male between the ages of 14-65.  Height: between 4'11" and 7'5".  Weight: between 65 and 450 lbs. Hair:  nappy or straight, long or short, in dreadlocks or cornrows.  Possibly bald.  He was last scene walking, running, or jogging, in baggy jeans, a business suit, sweat suit, or some shorts.  If you see anyone on the streets fitting this description, stop him immediately, call for backup and use the required force necessary to subdue him. That is all." <P>
Perhaps this is just my overactive paranoia speaking, but I am convinced that many of this country's police departments, whose sworn duty is to protect and serve, use this clarion call when rounding up their usual suspects.  <P>
What else could explain the behavior in the never-ending cycle of: "He Fits the Description?" <P>
My latest outrage is fueled by the recent videotaped incident in Cincinnati, Ohio where Nathaniel Jones died after being beaten by police when they tried to subdue him.  Sadly, the beating death -- which has been officially ruled a homicide -- does not surprise me.  I've grown accustomed to such beatings courtesy of the technological advances of video recording.  <P>
I seek not to ascertain preliminary guilt or innocence of the officers involved, rather to understand the seemingly selective police procedures that appears to be reserved for those men who possess the largest percentages of melanin in their skin.  <P>
In the summer of 2002, on consecutive nights, in Inglewood, CA and Oklahoma City, society was privy to the peculiar manner in which those particular police departments administer restraint to African American men. In Oklahoma City, two white officers were videotaped striking an unarmed black suspect 27 times with tactical batons.  In Inglewood, 16-year-old Donovan Jackson, was slammed and punched by police officers after he had been subdued and handcuffed. <P>
In the televised beating of Nathaniel Jones, we have again witnessed on national television -- shocking to some, all too real to others -- police engaging in seemingly indefensible tactics.  <P>
Could someone inform me of the intricacies of police work that deem it necessary for a white policeman to slam a 16-year-old black youth onto a car and punch him while handcuffed?  While you're at it, please explain the nuances that require an unarmed black man being struck 27 times.  Why not 17, or 37?  Why did members of the New York police department think it was a good idea to put a broomstick into the rectum of Abner Luima? Could you please tell me the type of wallet that Amadou Diallo had the night he held it up to police -- who mistakenly thought it was a 9-millimeter pistol and shot at him 41 times?  <P>
Because of my ignorance on such matters, I'm still trying to understand what part of Rodney King's body was still moving threateningly as Lawrence Powell did his best Babe Ruth impersonation.  The good people of Simi Valley told me that I did not see on the video what I thought I saw.  No wonder Marvin Gaye cried out: "Makes me wanna holla!" <P>
It puzzles me that there never seems to be a video camera around when police unleash their questionable tactics on my white brethren.  <P>
Therefore, to the white males who may read this piece:  if, while confronting police officers, you have been shot at 41 times while holding a wallet, been beaten beyond recognition, had a broomstick shoved in your rectum while in custody, been struck 27 times while unarmed, or simply had your face slammed and struck after you were subdued and handcuffed, could you please contact me ASAP? <P>
In doing so, you could go a long way in helping to ease my paranoia about police brutality against black men. I'll be waiting.
