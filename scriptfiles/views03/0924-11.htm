<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger could insure another White House win for George W. 
 Bush. 
<p>
 Especially now that the courts say it's ok for large numbers of citizens to 
 have their votes not counted---votes that, in another tight election or two, 
 could give Arnold and Bush final control of California and the nation. 
<p>
 Anyone who thinks that the White House and Karl Rove are not behind the 
 Schwarzenegger assault is not paying attention. 
<p>
 The Republican juggernaut now controls the governorships of New York, Texas 
 and Florida. With California they'd have the state houses of America's four 
 biggest states, plus the White House, Congress, the Judiciary and the media.  Is 
 there another word for one party rule? 
<p>
 In 2000, Gov. Jeb Bush guaranteed his brother's grab of the White House. 
 There were many twists and turns, but the core of the coup came with the 
 systematic removal of more than 50,000 "convicted felons"---people of color and other 
 suspected Democrats---from Florida's voting lists. Computer voting machine 
 manipulations may have cost Al Gore thousands more votes with a few keystrokes. 
 But ultimately, it was Jeb's control of the Florida state house that gave his 
 brother the White House. 
<p>
In Texas, Gov. Rick "Goodhair" Perry is now strongarming the legislature to 
 give Republicans a deeper hold on the US House of Representatives. 
 Redistricting normally occurs every ten years. But when the GOP took the Texas legislature 
 in 2002, Perry began calling special sessions to ram through a redistricting 
 plan that would all but eliminate Democrats from the Lone Star Congressional 
 delegation. 
<p>
 House Democrats first foiled that plan by fleeing to Oklahoma. US House 
 Majority Leader Tom DeLay sent Homeland Security after them, drawing widespread 
 hoots from those who belive we still have a Bill of Rights in this country. 
<p>
 Then Senate Democrats derailed Perry's second special session by fleeing to 
 Arizona, though one of them finally defected. 
<p>
 Despite widespread outcry, Perry has called a third special session, at an 
 overall cost of more than $1.5 million to angry Texas taxpayers. 
<p>
 Now Schwarzenegger is set to bring the trifecta to California. Gov. Gray 
 Davis did open the door by groveling at the feet of Southern California Edison and 
 other utilities who gouged the state during the 2000-1 electric deregulation 
 fiasco. 
<p>
 But that disaster's prime mover was none other than Schwarzenegger's Chief 
 Advisor, Pete Wilson. As Governor, Wilson rammed the dereg bill through the 
 legislature in 1996. Written by Southern California Edison, the infamous AB1890 
 handed some $30 billion in ratepayer and taxpayer charges to private utilities. 
 It then opened the door to Enron, Reliant and other GOP gas dealers who 
 grabbed another $60 billion.  Among the beneficiaries was Kenneth "Kenny-boy" Lay, 
 George W. Bush's Number One campaign contributor.   
<p>
 Despite all that, California's financial crisis is actually about average for 
 the Age of Bush, in which virtually all the states are on the brink of 
 bankruptcy. 
<p>
 Schwarzenegger is a clown candidate whose ignorance of the issues hides 
 beneath the smokescreen of his bizarre celebrity. At the end of a dying film 
 career, the Terminator's boorish sexism masks his foot soldier role in a 
 totalitarian tragedy. 
<p>
 Make no mistake about it:  Arnold is being spammed straight from the White 
 House. He's there to purge those voter rolls, sabotage the state legislature, 
 and do to California what's been done to Florida and Texas...and the nation.  
<p>
 Hasta la vista, American democracy.
