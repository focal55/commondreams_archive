<p>Sometimes the small stuff distracts from the big. At a recent 
press conference, George W. Bush suggested the White 
House had nothing to do with the "Mission Accomplished" 
banner that was hung on the USS Abraham Lincoln for his 
triumphant May 1 speech declaring major combat operations 
over in Iraq. Journalists quickly checked, and it turned out the 
White House had produced the banner. Bush-bashers 
decried his remark as a shameless lie that sought to shift 
blame to crewmembers, and White House defenders 
dismissed the matter as trivial. But during the same press 
conference, Bush tossed out other truth-challenged 
statements that were arguably more important than the 
banner business. But they have drawn little notice.</p>
<p>
Bush claimed that he was the first president to advocate a 
Palestinian state. No, Bill Clinton had done so. (From a 
January 7, 2001 Clinton speech: "There can be no genuine 
resolution to the [Middle East] conflict without a sovereign, 
viable Palestinian state that accommodates Israel's security 
requirements and demographic realities.") And when a 
reporter asked how Bush could make up the $23 billion gap 
between the $33 billion pledged for Iraq reconstruction and 
the estimated $56 billion pricetag for rebuilding, he said 
"Iraqi oil revenues...coupled with private investments should 
make up the difference." Yet Paul Bremer, the head of the 
U.S. occupation authority in Iraq, has noted that in the 
near-term oil industry revenues will cover only the industry's 
costs. That is, there will be no oil revenues available to pay 
for reconstruction. More importantly, in response to a pointed 
question about the MIA WMDs--"Can you explain…whether 
you were surprised those weapons haven't turned up, why 
they haven't turned up, and whether you feel that your 
administration's credibility has been affected in any way by 
that?"--Bush countered, "We took action based upon good, 
solid intelligence."</p>
<p>
<i> Good, solid intelligence</i>--that sounds like a subjective 
evaluation. But a statement of opinion can be deceptive if it is 
sufficiently divorced from facts. And a series of postwar 
findings indicate that Bush was not being truthful when he 
characterized the prewar intelligence on Iraq's weapons of 
mass destruction as "good" and "solid."</p>
<p>
Since the major combat concluded, several official and 
credible sources have publicly noted that the prewar 
intelligence on Iraq and its supposed WMDs was neither 
strong nor reliable.</p>
<p>
* In interviews with reporters in July, Richard Kerr, a former 
CIA deputy director conducting a review of the CIA's prewar 
intelligence, said that intelligence had been somewhat 
ambiguous. He noted that US intelligence analysts had been 
forced to rely upon information from the early and mid 1990s 
and had possessed little hard evidence to evaluate after 
1998 (when UN inspectors left Iraq). The material that did 
come in following that, he said, was mostly "circumstantial or 
"inferential." It was "less specific and detailed" than in 
previous years. Kerr maintained that the CIA analysts had 
attached the "appropriate caveats" to this "scattered" and 
less-than-definitive intelligence.</p>
<p>
* In late September, Representative Porter Goss, the 
chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Jane 
Harman, the ranking Democrat on the panel, sent a letter to 
CIA chief George Tenet that criticized the prewar intelligence 
for relying on outdated, "circumstantial" and "fragmentary" 
information, noting that the intelligence contained "too many 
uncertainties." This conclusion was based on the 
committee's review of 19 volumes of classified prewar 
intelligence. Goss, a former CIA case officer, and Harman 
maintained the committee's review had found "significant 
deficiencies" in the intelligence community's collection of 
intelligence after 1998. They cited a "lack of specific 
intelligence" on Iraq's WMDs and the alleged tie between 
Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. The CIA challenged this 
assessment. In early November, Goss reiterated that there 
had been fundamental shortcomings in the prewar 
intelligence, but he nonetheless defended the administration 
prewar warnings about Iraq's WMDs. Still, he could offer but 
a lukewarm endorsement of the intelligence agencies, 
commenting that they "did the best they could with what they 
had."</p>
<p>
* When David Kay, the chief WMD-hunter in Iraq, testified 
before Congress on October 2, he said that the intelligence 
community from 1991 to 2003 had a tough time gathering 
accurate information on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. 
"The result," he said, "was that our understanding of the 
status of Iraq's WMD program was always bounded by large 
uncertainties and had to be heavily caveated."</p>
<p>
* In late October, Senator Pat Roberts, the Republican 
chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said that the 
prewar intelligence had sometimes been "sloppy" and 
inconclusive. Bush, he complained, had been "ill-served by 
the intelligence community." His committee is continuing its 
review of the prewar intelligence, but Roberts has been 
opposing Democratic efforts to examine whether Bush 
mischaracterized the intelligence in his prewar statements.</p>
<p>
So if a former deputy CIA chief, the Republican and 
Democratic leaders of the House intelligence committee, the 
chief weapons hunter (who works for the CIA and the 
Pentagon), and the chairman of the Senate intelligence 
committee each say that the prewar intelligence on Iraq was 
loaded with doubt, and if most of this group also maintain 
that it was based on uncertain information, how can Bush 
call this material "good, solid intelligence"? Who's not being 
honest? Of course, Bush has a strong motive to hype the 
intelligence. If Kerr, Kay, Harman and Roberts are correct, 
then there are three options: Bush misread the intelligence, 
he ignored the intelligence (in whole or in part), or the 
intelligence was misrepresented to him (and he has taken 
no steps to punish those who did so). Any of these scenarios 
would be painful for Bush to admit. Yet each would be a far 
more significant act than fudging the truth about a PR stunt.</p>
