<p>In October 2001, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act setting aside many 
of our individual freedoms for the sake of fighting terrorism. Since 
then, I've worried about what's happening to democracy.

<p>Do we understand the threat USA PATRIOT poses to our civil liberties? Or

are we willing to give up our rights and freedoms in return for a 
promise of safety, and shrug off the danger to democracy from an 
unaccountable government?

<p>I'm not worried anymore.

<p>By last week, 132 cities and counties and three states had passed 
resolutions stating their intention not to cooperate with some 
provisions of USA PATRIOT. Elected office-holders in these communities 
have publicly declared that they will not abide by federal laws and 
orders that would compel them to accord the people in their jurisdiction

less than full rights and protections guaranteed to all persons in the 
US Constitution.

<p>These resolutions have happened because of people who care about civil 
liberties. Groups of citizens in each of these communities have 
conducted public forums, met with elected office-holders, sought 
endorsements, drafted resolution language, canvassed neighborhoods 
getting signatures on petitions, given countless talks about threats to 
the Bill of Rights, and brought out standing-room-only crowds for public

hearings and votes.

<p>Who are these people who have convinced so many local lawmaking bodies 
to openly oppose federal law?

<p>If they're anything like the Bill of Rights Defense Committees in 
Minneapolis and St. Paul, they are folks from all walks of life, all 
income levels and all points on the political spectrum.

<p>Teachers. Consultants. Environmentalists. People who voted for George 
Bush. People who voted for Ralph Nader. Engineers. Unemployed people. 
Civil rights attorneys. Minimum-wage workers. Retired persons. Students.

Supporters of the war on Iraq. People of faith. And a large minority 
from the arts community, people to whom freedom of expression is as dear

as life itself.

<p>And many, if not most, are involved for the first time in civil society 
political activism.

<p>What they have in common is a conviction that the rights, freedoms and 
protections guaranteed in the Constitution are at the very core of what 
it means to be an American. They view the Bill of Rights as a precious 
heritage from our ancestors who struggled for generations to ensure that

these freedoms would be for all people, not just a certain class. And 
they are unwilling to part with these cherished rights and freedoms in 
return for an empty promise of safety from terrorism.

<p>As a participant in the <a href="http://minneapolis.bordc.org/" target="_new">Minneapolis Bill of Rights Defense Committee</a>, 
which successfully urged the Minneapolis City Council to pass a 
resolution in April, I was interviewed for two recent mass-media stories

on this effort, one in the Minneapolis Star Tribune and one on National 
Public Radio. In these and all other media coverage I've seen, 
journalists have missed the real story by framing it as a contest between

proponents and opponents of USA PATRIOT.

<p>The significance of resistance to USA PATRIOT and similar acts is not 
who's 'right' and 'wrong' about how much they erode civil liberties, or 
whether that erosion is justifiable.

<p>The real story is that people in communities that now total more 16 
million in population have persuaded their city councils to pass, often 
unanimously or near-unanimously, resolutions in direct defiance of 
federal legislation. And if the other cities and states with active 
citizen groups urging similar resolutions also pass them, the total 
number of people living in civil rights-protective communities could 
rise to more than 45 million.

<p>This is the real story -- that the Bush administration's efforts to 
launch the most direct assault on individual rights and protections 
since the Alien and Sedition Acts in the early days of our nation, have 
sparked in response the most open and defiant assertion of local 
democracy ever seen.

<p>There's no doubt that as a society we take our freedom for granted. Most

of us likely could not recite all the rights guaranteed in the 
Constitution. And there are many who never learned about those rights 
and don't value them.

<p>But this grassroots uprising in defense of the Bill of Rights involving 
people in hundreds of communities and of all ages, careers and political

persuasions -- and the willingness of local and state elected 
office-holders to stand up in opposition to federal efforts to curb 
civil liberties -- convinces me that the Bill of Rights is still for 
many, many Americans a living heritage worthy of immense effort to protect.

<p>I know of nothing more hopeful than this for the future of democracy and

freedom.
