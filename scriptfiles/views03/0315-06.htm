<p>BAGHDAD, March 12, 2003 -- Late in the evening on March 10, we learned from a UN
worker that remaining support staff for UN
organizations other than UNMOVIC inspectors would be
shuttling out of Baghdad on March 12, in accordance
with involuntary departure orders.  Many of the UN
staff had already left in a slow attrition
accomplished through applications for vacation leave
or re-assignments.  We lined the departure road in
early morning hours on March 12 holding enlarged
photos, on vinyl banners, of Iraqi people, many of
them children, who've befriended us during seven years
of regular visits to Iraq.  Our banner, strung in
front of a tent encampment across from the UN
Compound, read:
<p>Farewell UN<br>
  Please Advise:<br>
     Who will protect Iraqi children?
<p>Rumors proliferate around us. The diplomatic community
will evacuate embassies on Saturday, March 15. The
inspectors will pull out on Monday, March 17. Who
knows if any of them are true? But we do know is that
time is very short.  Within days, the US government
may start the saturation bombing of Iraq.  
<p>I spent this morning coloring with eight year old
Sohab, a patient in the cancer ward at the Al Mansour
hospital.  She is too weak to uncap the markers, but
delights in choosing colors and carefully making
bright colored pictures in a children's coloring book.
 War seemed light years away from warfare during the
calm quiet morning with this radiantly beautiful
child.  I remember the broken glass and shattered
windows that lined the roadway in front of this same
hospital, in December 1998, when Desert Fox bombing
destroyed a decrepit "old ministry of defense
building" across from the hospital.  I hope we can
help comfort Sohab, if she's still hospitalized when
bombing comes.  
<p>It's too much to hope for protection of the vast
majority of people here from anticipated consequences
of an attack and invasion on Iraq.  According to a UN
document for the planning of humanitarian relief, the
expected outcomes of a US campaign of bombing and
invasion includes:
<p>-   	500,000 civilian casualties,<br>
-   	2,000,000 people homeless,<br>
-   	10,000,000 people without enough to eat,<br>
-   	18,000,000 without access to clean water, and<br>
-   	more than 1,000,000 children under the age of 5,
  at risk of death from malnutrition.<br>
  
<p>War plans released by the US military state that more
than 3,000 bombs and missiles will fall on Iraq, more
than used in the entire Gulf War, in the first 48
hours of the campaign.  The New York Times quoted
Pentagon officials as saying, "There will be no place
in Baghdad that will be safe." Baghdad is a city of
4,500,000 people.
<p>Three days ago,  reports were released about US
testing, in Florida, of the new  Massive Ordinance Air
Bomb (MOAB)-an improved version of the daisy cutter
bomb. This   21,000 pounds fuel air explosive must be
dropped via parachute so that the plane which fires it
has time to fly beyond the field of explosion, the
"kill radius," lest the bomb destroy the plane. The
MOAB has the explosive capacity of a small tactical
nuclear weapon. 
<p>Small wonder, then, that on March 11 eight mothers in
a maternity hospital run by Dominican sisters, opted
to have their babies by Caesarean section.  They
didn't want to bear babies during the bombing.  Six 
women spontaneously aborted on the same day.
<p>I asked Dr. Hameesh, at the Al Mansour Hospital, if he
ever anticipated, when he was a young student, that he
would have to learn so much about electrical
engineering, sewage and sanitation, and economics.
<p>First, he laughingly insisted that he is still young. 
We swiftly agreed.  "We never imagined," he said,
"that we would be face to face in a war with the
United States.  It is so far away.  We are separated
by oceans.  Never did we dream that we would be face
to face with the United States in such a war,"
<p>Mohammed, our driver, knows all too well what it means
to be face to face with enemy soldiers in battle.  He
is the sort of person who anticipates needs before
they are even voiced.  When I eyed a vacant lot,
feeling perplexed about how to string up a banner,
Mohammed was already tying a knot and within minutes
had climbed a palm tree with the banner under his arm.
 This morning I was rummaging through lists trying to
figure out if today was a day when some of our members
needed to check in at a health clinic for
certification of having received an AIDS test. 
Mohammed was already sitting in the lobby, waiting to
catch my eye.  He quietly nodded, stubbing out his
cigarette.  "Yes, Madame Kathy," he said, smiling.
"Today, AIDS test."  
<p>He's the jefe of a friendly cabal of cab drivers who
assemble outside the Al Fanar hotel, every morning.  I
can barely remember a day in the past five months when Mohammed's small and dilapidated red car wasn't parked outside at 7:30 a.m. So it came as a surprise that he wanted to fly to Basra with us and accompany us on our four day vigil at the Iraq-Kuwait border.  When I said "Sure, why not?" he dashed off to the Iraqi Airways office to purchase the last available ticket.
<p>In Basra, as we made arrangements to head further
south toward Safwan, Mohammed seemed strangely
subdued.  He stared silently out the window while we
drove toward the border.  "Mohammed," I asked, "is
this your first time visiting Basra?"  "No," he said,
"I was here in 1982."  Then I remembered.  Mohammed
was a soldier in the Iran-Iraq war.  During our four
day visit, he began to disclose more details.  He had
been left for dead, in a field, after a battle between
Iranian and Iraqi soldiers.  During the attack,
several bullets grazed his head. Another bullet cut
off one finger.  One bullet pierced his backpack, and
tore right through his chest.  Several bullets were
embedded in his upper arm and leg.  Mohammed somehow
survived and spent a full year recovering in a
hospital.  "In my day," said Mike Ferner, a US Medical
Corp man from the Viet Nam War era, "We'd say you were well-ventilated."  He and Mohammed laughed gently.
<p>I can anticipate Mohammed's main need just now.  He
makes a little profit from vigilantly accompanying us,
but I know that more than anything he desperately
wants us to succeed in preventing a new war.  Mohammed
knows what it means to be torn apart by war.  "Madame
Kathy," he said, leaving Basra, "We don't want this
for our children."  
<p>During our time in Safwan, on the Iraq-Kuwait border,
a dozen of us sat in a semicircle, in white plastic
chairs, comfortably bundled up in warm clothes and
blankets, at the border between Iraq and Kuwait.  We
were within shouting distance of soldiers on the other
side.  When Charlie Litkey clambered atop a large
piece of debris to call out a message to uniformed men
across the border, he began by shouting Al Salaam
Alaykum.  (Peace be upon you).  "Alaykum wa salaam,"
they shouted back.  Reflections offered by my
companions touched me "in the deep heart's core."  

<p>Credible and admirable relief/humanitarian
organizations have recorded numerous strategies and
mandates regarding what to do in the event of war. 
But perhaps our "brief" has best been captured by
Neville Watson's 10 year old granddaughter.  This is
her response to a primary school writing assignment. 

<p>GRANDPA

<p>My Grandpa is the minister of Wembley Downs Uniting
Church.
<p>He has gone on many protests in his life including
sitting in a small box overnight outside parliament to
protest about the jail cells.
<p>He sat in the middle of the gulf and takes in
refugees.
<p>But this time he is going to sit in Baghdad and
comfort the Iraqi people while the Americans bomb
them.
<p>You may think he is nutty but I am proud of him.  He
does what is right and he does it for other people not
himself.
<p>On the day he left he had every TV station apart from
Channel 7 interviewing him, even the New Idea.
<p>When he left we were all supset.  Poor Grandma will
have to live on her own for six weeks and maybe
forever.
<p>I love Grandpa very much and I hope he will return.

<p>--Jessie  (age 10) 

<p>"And so do I, Jessie," said Neville, softly.  "And so
do I."
