<p>On a beautiful afternoon in 1959, Coretta and I journeyed from our 
hotel in Beirut to take a plane for Jerusalem. After about two hours in the 
air we were notified to fasten our seat belts -- we were beginning to descend 
for the airport in Jerusalem. Because of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this city 
has been divided.
<P>And so this was a strange feeling -- to go to the ancient city of God and 
see the tragedies of man's hate and evil which causes him to fight and live in 
conflict.
<P>Israel's right to exist as a state in security is incontestable. At the 
same time the great powers have the obligation to recognize that the Arab 
world is in a state of imposed poverty and backwardness that must threaten 
peace and harmony. Until a concerted and democratic program of assistance is 
affected, tensions cannot be relieved. So there is a need for a Marshall Plan 
for the Middle East.
<P>At the heart of the problem are oil interests. As the American Jewish 
Congress has stated, "American policies in the Middle East have been motivated 
in no small measure by the desire to protect the $2.5 billion stake which U.S. 
oil companies have invested in the area." Some Arab feudal rulers are no less 
concerned for oil wealth and neglect the plight of their own peoples.
<P>The solution will have to be found in statesmanship by Israel and 
progressive Arab forces who, in concert with the great powers, recognize that 
fair and peaceful solutions are the concern of all of humanity. Neither 
military measures nor a stubborn effort to reverse history can provide a 
permanent solution.
<P>As I said in my Nobel Peace Prize Lecture: Nations are not reducing, but 
rather increasing, their arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. The 
proliferation of nuclear weapons has not been halted. The fact that most of 
the time human beings put the risk of nuclear war out of their minds because 
it is too painful does not alter the risk of such a war. Man's proneness to 
engage in war is still a fact, but wisdom born of experience should tell us 
that war is obsolete.
<P>If we assume that life is worth living, that man has a right to survive, 
then we must find an alternative. In a day when guided ballistic missiles 
carve highways of death through the stratosphere, no nation can claim victory 
in war. A so-called limited war will leave little more than a calamitous 
legacy of human suffering, political turmoil and political disillusionment. A 
world war, God forbid, would leave only smoldering ashes as a mute testimony 
to the human race whose folly led to ultimate death. If modern man continues 
to flirt unhesitatingly with war, he will transform his earthly habitat into 
an inferno even the mind of Dante could not imagine.
<P>It is not enough to say we must not wage war. It is necessary to love peace 
and sacrifice for it. We must shift the arms race into the peace race.
<P>In 1967, when I took my stand against the war in Vietnam, I recounted that 
I had lived in the ghettos of Chicago and Cleveland, and I knew the hurt, the 
cynicism and the discontent. As I walked among the desperate, rejected and 
angry young men, I told them Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve 
their problems. I tried to offer my deepest compassion while maintaining my 
conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent 
action.
<P>But they asked, and rightly so, "What about Vietnam?" They asked if our own 
nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring 
about the changes it wanted. I knew that I could never again raise my voice 
against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first 
spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own 
government.
<P>In 1957, a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him 
that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution. This need to 
maintain social stability for our investments . . . tells why American 
helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Cambodia and why American 
napalm and Green Beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru. 
. . .
<P>It is with such activities in mind that the words of the late John F. 
Kennedy come back to haunt us. He said, "Those who make peaceful revolution 
impossible will make violent revolution inevitable." Increasingly, by choice 
or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken, the role of those who 
make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and 
pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments.
<P>When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are 
considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme 
materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.
<P>A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and 
justice of many of our past and present policies. A true revolution of values 
will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. The 
Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and 
nothing to learn from them is not just.
<P>A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of 
war, "This way of settling differences is not just." This business of burning 
human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and 
widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples 
normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields 
physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with 
wisdom, justice, and love.
<P>A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military 
defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. 
America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the 
way in this revolution of values. There is nothing except a tragic death wish 
to prevent us from reordering our priorities, so that the pursuit of peace 
will take precedence over the pursuit of war.
