<p>The International Whaling Commission has taken on a new role as a conservation body following alarming reports that as many as 300,000 whales, dolphins and porpoises are drowning after getting entangled in fishing nets every year. 

<p>Delegates at the annual IWC (International Whaling Commission) meeting in Berlin voted this week to make whale conservation a priority for the organisation. 

<p>The decision carried by a narrow majority of 25 to 20 stirred huge controversy among IWC (International Whaling Commission) members who have been at loggerheads for years over the declining whale population. 

<p>Back in 1946 when the IWC was founded, its decision-making body consisted of just 14 member states. Whales were still plentiful and the signatory countries were looking primarily for ways to manage the catch. 

<p>By 1986 the whale population had fallen so low that the commission passed a moratorium on commercial whaling that is still in effect. The moratorium does not extend to what the commission calls "aboriginal subsistence whaling", and also allows nations to issue so-called scientific permits to hunt whales for research. Since 1998 only Japan has issued such permits. 

<p>But "times have changed since those days," Dr Susan Lieberman, head of the <a href="http://www.panda.org" target="_new">World Wildlife Fund</a> (WWF) said in a comment after the meeting. The 'by-catch', the term used for whales and dolphins getting trapped in nets, is the single biggest threat to the survival of the 80 or so species of whales, dolphins and porpoises -- collectively known as cetaceans. 

<p>The IWC decision to extend its role from global whale management to conservation was "a historic day for cetacean conservation," she said. The IWC would now be in a position to tackle a variety of threats to cetaceans beyond commercial whaling. 

<p>Pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway had asked for this "Berlin initiative" for a whale conservation committee to be removed from the agenda. When that failed, they lobbied member-countries to vote against the resolution. 

<p>Japanese delegates staged a walk-out after the vote was passed. Minoru Morimote, Japan's whaling commissioner, called the decision "a final blow to the already polarised IWC." 

<p>The decision means that a new IWC committee will now seek ways to protect whales. The three strongest pro-whaling countries, Japan, Norway and Iceland, announced after the vote that they would not support the new IWC initiative.. 

<p>Lieberman says the Berlin initiative would deliver major conservation benefits. "This puts conservation at the heart of the IWC," she said. The pro-whaling countries should "support the will of the majority and work in a spirit of cooperation and multilateralism on the initiative." 

<p>Renate Kunast, Germany's Minister for Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, said at the meeting that the core of the debate was whether there could be such a thing as "sustainable harvesting" of whales. "The best way to approach whales is not with the harpoon but with the camera," she said. 

<p>New estimates suggest that whale watching is today a "billion dollar a year industry, and still growing," she said. Whale watching is particularly popular in Latin America, Iceland, Africa, the United States, Norway and some parts of Europe, she said. "It's a most positive form of tourism for everyone involved," said Kunast, adding that whales had fascinated her since she was a child. 

<p>Pro-whaling delegates did succeed on another front. They managed to block proposals to expand sanctuaries for whales in the South Pacific and South Atlantic. The move needed a three-quarters majority. The WWF has been campaigning since 2001 to secure a network of whale sanctuaries in the South Pacific region.
