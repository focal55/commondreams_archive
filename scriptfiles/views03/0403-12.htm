<p>With the chicken hawk-driven war on Iraq in high gear, Bush and Cheney 

have learned that the best way to silence the Democratic Party, distract

from their miserable domestic outrages and provide the corporate and 

rich classes with favors is to envelop our nation in fear. Using false or distorted statements, contrary to the findings of U.S. 

intelligence agencies, to exaggerate Iraqi threats, weapons and 

terrorist (al-Qaeda) connections as reasons for the war, their invasion 

and prolonged occupation may produce greater risks of stateless 

terrorism in the U.S. Last fall, the CIA informed Congress of just this 

higher probability resulting from an Iraqi invasion.

Watching reports describing our draft-dodging President as totally 

immersed in the scope and details of his Iraqi invasion, a number of 

puzzling questions arise:

<p>1.) Why is Bush pouring half of the entire U.S. military at huge cost 

into the Persian Gulf while rejecting the frantic requests by cities and

states (such as New York City) for overdue monies for homeland security?

<p>2.) What will Bush say to Americans if no weaponized nuclear, chemical 

or biological materials are found in Iraq or, if found, not used, as 60 

Minutes World War II vet Andy Rooney believes we ourselves would use if 

a powerful foreign invasion was overwhelming our country? The CIA told 

Bush that Saddam would be more likely to use these chemical and 

biological weapons if the U.S. invades.

<p>3.) With domestic necessities of the American people being ignored, why 

is Bush pushing Congress for yet another huge tax cut for the wealthy 

while Alan Greenspan is warning about larger budget deficits this year 

and afterwards?

<p>4.) Albeit surrounded by his little clique of ideologues, why has Bush 

refused requests to meet from any of thirteen major antiwar groups 

representing tens of millions of Americans? They include labor, 

business, clergy, human rights, war veterans, academics with national 

security experience, physicians and elected city officials who have much

to inform him. Some have battle experience in the Gulf and know about 

toxic exposures to our troops. Others have returned from Iraq with first

hand knowledge about conditions. Still others are steeped in the 

boomerang effect of ill-advised belligerence and distraction from more 

serious global conflicts and struggles against sabotage.

Tony Blair in London received for nearly an hour a delegation from the 

National Council of Churches headed by former Congressman Bob Edgar. Yet

the Council leaders have been rejected by their own President for the 

past year. There is the cause and effect of history that Bush needs to 

know about in the Middle East. Maybe he would not have used the word 

"crusade" or have invoked God's will and his divine guidance regarding 

overthrowing Saddam. Such references are viewed in Islamic societies as 

meaning a religious war.

<p>But Bush does not seek any advice, information or insights from these 

informed Americans. He ignored all their written requests (see 

  <a href="http://www.essentialaction.org" target="_new">www.essentialaction.org</a>).

<p>5.) Immersed in Iraq, Bush pays little attention to America. He is 

spending far more time on the Middle East, and destructively so, than on

the manufacturing decline of the Middle West. And he wants to cut 

veterans benefits. His unchallenged domination of the mass media leaves 

little space for others to raise these issues.

<p>Heard about opportunity cost (or opportunities lost) of his 

Messianicmilitarism lately? No attention to a long frozen minimum wage, 

worsening poverty, skyrocketing drug prices along with soaring consumer 

bills for oil and natural gas. Heard about advances needed for energy 

efficiency and solar power and less gas guzzling motor vehicles? Bush 

has put America on hold!

<p>6.) What is a weapon of mass destruction anyhow? Ask Iraqi families 

whether or not Bush has sent weapons of mass destruction from the air, 

from the sea and on land, to smash their country and destroy tens of 

thousands of lives in order to topple one man. Haven't the economic 

sanctions blocking medicines, surgical materials and sanitation 

purifiers for clean drinking water taken the lives of enough Iraqi 

children over a decade? Deliberately making civilians suffer for a 

military overthrow of a dictator happens to be a violation of 

international law.

<p>7.) Why did know-it-all Bush, who ironically brags about making 

decisions from his gut, stifle dissent from his war policy and its 

likely aftermath that still simmers at sub-cabinet levels inside the 

Pentagon, the CIA and the State Department? Leading retired Generals, 

Admirals, diplomats and national security officials tried to articulate 

the same criticism publicly over the past few months.

<p>8.) Except for the oil and munitions industries, the war is a downer on 

the economy. A few business executives have spoken up strongly. Most are

not prone to speak publicly for fear of retaliation by the Bush 

Administration which, in this area, is believed to be vindictive against

corporate dissenters.

<p>From the big Geneva Switzerland auto show last month, Automotive News' 

executive editor, Peter Brown of Detroit, talked to many European auto 

executives. He writes: "Personally, most of the executives oppose the 

war as unnecessary and likely to lead to greater terrorism and 

instability." This is pretty much the judgment of most of the U.S. 

foreign policy establishmentwhose prominent ex-government officials are 

also being ignored by the all-knowing, instinct-driven President.
