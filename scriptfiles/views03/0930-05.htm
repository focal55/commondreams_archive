<p>The latest CNN/USA Today poll in the California Recall Election betrays 
a dangerous trend: a large majority of Californians now polled think 
that the recall is a good idea -- 63% compared with 59% three weeks ago. 
So now the candidates running to replace Gray Davis really do matter-- 
not all 135 of the registered candidates whose number seems to be the 
object of much amusement across the nation -- but the top candidates, 
one of who will most likely be our new governor. This means either 
Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, or actor and body builder, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger.

<p>Schwarzenegger scored the highest in this latest poll which is the 
second most disturbing aspect of the poll. His popularity is now at 40%, 
compared to Bustamante’s 25%, a drastic turnaround compared to 25/30 
three weeks ago. Not withstanding the sheer power of popular culture to 
catapult any celebrity onto the political stage, Mr. Schwarzenegger has 
played a very dirty game, and those who have bent rules to help him, are 
equally culpable.

<p>The 1934 Communications Act has an Equal Time provision which asserts 

that any media program, barring purely news programs, cannot provide an 
unfair share of broadcast time to any single candidate in an election 
without making available equal time to all other candidates within 7 
days of the original broadcast date. To date, Schwarzenegger’s friends 
in the media have bent over backwards and widely featured him in 
apparent violations of the Equal time rule. Clearly these media 
spotlights are much more beneficial to a candidate who has little to say 
and refuses to debate other candidates unless given the questions before 
hand. But if you look closely, it is not simply Howard Stern, Jay Leno, 
Oprah Winfrey and Larry King who have bent the rules of fair game, but 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) itself.  In a September 9th 
ruling, the FCC decided that the Howard Stern show was a “bonafide news 
interview program and therefore exempt … decisions on format, content, 
and participants are based on newsworthiness”. It is difficult to see 
how a show that features banana sucking contests and dates with porn 
stars as prizes qualifies as news. The FCC justified this by saying that 
“guests that happen to be political candidates are not selected to 
advance their candidacies.” It is comforting that the FCC, charged with 
overseeing our airwaves, places such deep trust in the agendas of Stern, 
Winfrey and other tabloid talk show hosts.

 
<p>The Equal Time provision that required Schwarzenegger’s movies to be 
barred from network TV in the run up to the election has done little to 
prevent his star power from grabbing Californians' votes through the 
idiot box. Cable stations, which are exempt from the Equal Time rule, 
have routinely run the Terminator movies in anticipation of the 
elections – only two channels, the Sci-fi and FX channels have chosen 
voluntarily not to air Schwarzenegger’s films. "People will go on seeing 
his movie on cable channels anyway," said Martin Kaplan, professor of 
communications at the University of Southern California. "In any case he 
gets so much attention from the media that he is still the person most 
in voters' faces” (AFP, 08/14). Schwarzenegger didn’t have to bankrupt 
his campaign in order to buy publicity – the media are providing it for 
free.

<p>Even with the free ride from major media and the FCC, the Schwarzenegger 
“Total Recall” campaign is about 2 million dollars in debt. “Total 
Recall” is outspending all other candidates’ campaigns on paid 
advertisements on the airwaves, and incurring the largest debt of any of 
the candidates. With his rhetoric of cutting spending while keeping 
taxes down in an already bankrupt state, Schwarzenegger has promised 
that his business acumen is just what California needs. In a post 
election California, one hopes that quality schools, hospitals, jobs and 
elder care are at least as important to Mr. Schwarzenegger as winning an 
election.

 
<p>This essay is not about Arnold’s accent, or his physical appearance, or 
even his extra-marital affairs. Recent comments from the left or 
Democratic Party on such issues are spiteful personal attacks that have 
little to do with Schwarzenegger’s fitness for office. His past life is 
relevant only in as much as it reflects his attitudes toward women and 
people of color. Schwarzenegger’s notorious bragging of sexual and 
otherwise degrading assaults on women have clearly struck a deep chord 
in women who have largely rejected this candidate. His persistent use of 
the “n” word, now publicized by two black fellow body builders, far 
overshadow the Lieutenant Governor’s similar mishap. His assertion that 
he is a poster child for immigrants, while opposing drivers’ licenses 
for undocumented workers and supporting the racist Proposition 187, 
speaks volumes about the race and class privilege he will undoubtedly 
preserve if he wins.

<p>Having a pro-choice, pro-gun control position, Schwarzenegger is an 
anathema to the traditional conservative Republican, and yet most 
Republicans back him, not necessarily because he has specific ideas on 
how to run the fifth largest economy in the world, but because “he can 

win”. Mr. Schwarzenegger imagines that talking down to the public 
through clichés based on his movies will be enough to sell his 
qualifications. This is what he has to say when he is not engaging in 
Terminator-speak:

<p>"The mass [sic] wants to hear one thing and wants to see one thing: Do I 
trust this guy? Does he have answers? How does he handle himself with 
the media? How does he handle himself out there? And this is someone 
that I can rally behind him and say, yes I want to go with this guy, 
he's bringing me hope. And that's what I want to bring to the table 
here, not the details. ... " (AP, 09/04).

<p>Schwarzenegger has certainly figured out how to "handle himself with the 
media". State-wide and national media have done little to challenge this 
type of condescending and self-serving rhetoric, choosing instead to 
hold Schwarzenegger’s hand all the way into Sacramento.
