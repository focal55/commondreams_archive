<p>The good news: Six journalists were offered the name of a covert CIA operative, but only one was sleazy enough to use it. 

<p>That speaks well of the profession, but not so well of columnist Bob Novak, who outed the operative. Novak has been around long enough to know better. 

<p>So ... am I the only one who wonders how Department of Justice investigators spend their time? By Monday of last week, they (allegedly) already were trying to find out who leaked the name of the CIA operative to Novak and the other five journalists. 

<p>By Thursday, according to news reports, they were still in the process of putting together an investigative "team." 

<p>Do these people take exceptionally long coffee breaks? How much effort does it take to toddle over to the White House and ask questions? Is the job of picking up telephone records really that formidable? How hard is it to call NBC foreign-affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell (who was given the CIA operative's name but didn't use it) and ask if she wants to identify the snake who gave her the name? After all, her informant committed a felony in revealing the name, and wanted Mitchell to compound the felony. 

<p>Does Mitchell have an obligation to protect a source like that? I don't think so. 

<p>Bob Novak certainly knows who gave him the name. Why not ask him? He was willing to assist a lawbreaker. Maybe he'll be equally willing to help the lawmen. 

<p>If the Justice Department is using one, or maybe two, investigators, I can see why their investigation might take all week. But, with a larger "team," shouldn't they have wound it up in a day or two? 

<p>By the way, did you notice how George W. Bush reacted to questions about the investigation? He did not, as one might have expected, say, "Bring it on!" 

<p>Instead, he said he wants to find out who the tattletale is and, when he finds out, "take care of him." 

<p>That's why you have to listen carefully to what Bush says. He made "take care of" sound ominous, but it might have meant "protect." He might well have said, "We'll hire lawyers for him, we'll help him destroy records, we'll express the highest confidence in his innocence and we'll put him on paid leave, if it comes to that." 

<p>In other words, "We'll take care of him." 

<p>Bush reminds me, in this instance, of a famous courtroom story of a murder trial in which the body was never found. The defense attorney, in a moment of inspired drama, announced in court that not only was his client innocent but also that the alleged victim was about to walk into the courtroom. 

<p>With that, all eyes turned to the courtroom door. Nobody came in, but the attorney had made his point. If the jury believed the alleged victim was dead, why did they expect him to walk into court? 

<p>It was a good device, but it didn't work. The defendant was convicted anyway. Unfortunately for him, when all other eyes turned to the courtroom door, his didn't. The jurors noticed, and he was a goner. 

<p>Bush's apparent lack of curiosity over the leaker in the White House reminds me of that story. Most CEOs would be frantically trying to identify who in their midst had the poor judgment to name a covert CIA operative, but Bush seems blasé about the whole thing. Could it be he already knows? 

<p>Perhaps Bush should be questioned under oath. 

<p>IN OTHER NEWS, I found myself feeling sorry last week for Rush Limbaugh, and even more sorry for ESPN, the cable sports network. 

<p>ESPN should review its hiring policies. It made the mistake a few years ago of hiring a former funnyman, Dennis Miller, as color commentator for its "Monday Night Football" games. 

<p>They should have hired him years earlier, when he was a social critic. Then, he was funny. But when he graduated into his present persona (i.e., pompous ass), he stopped being funny. 

<p>It isn't that he doesn't try. God knows the man tries. I've never seen anyone who works as hard as Miller trying to be funny. He works so hard, it's painful to watch him. 

<p>But -- well, why go on? If you've seen him anytime in the past few years, you have seen for yourself how he went from bright young observer to worn-out curmudgeon without a period of sensible adulthood in between. 

<p>Pity. A sad case. 

<p>So, ESPN, a slow learner, fires Miller and hires Rush Limbaugh, who doesn't last even half a season. 

<p>Why? Because before last Monday's game, he made a remark that could be construed as racist. 

<p>ESPN must have been shocked, shocked, to hear Limbaugh talk like that. Apparently, they've never heard his radio program. What he said Monday was innocuous -- by his standards. 

<p>In defense of Limbaugh, I wouldn't classify him as a racist, regardless of what he said last week. What he is is an elitist. He doesn't think he's better than just black people. He thinks he's better than everybody. 

<p>Limbaugh is down on blacks, to be sure, and anybody with skin darker than the pasty white he's cursed with. But he's also down on children, women, poor people, liberals, immigrants, socialists, Muslims, environmentalists, Democrats, foreigners -- you get the picture. 

<p>If life hasn't been kind to you, don't expect Limbaugh to be. He worships success, and does his best to ride its coattails. When one is a chronic apple polisher of his ilk, the size of your checkbook, not the size of your heart, is what matters. 

<p>As for the reports that Limbaugh might be involved in illegal buys of painkilling drugs, I hope they turn out to be true. But not for the obvious liberal reason. Sure, I'd like to see a cruel know-it-all like Limbaugh with egg on his face, but, more important, I'd like to see sympathetic attention drawn to the problem of painkillers, prescription or otherwise. 

<p>If Rush used too many painkillers, it was because he was in too much pain. If he became addicted, and if his addiction led to his hearing problems, that's punishment enough for the man. 

<p>Sooner or later, folks, we have to become civilized enough to take the un-Limbaugh-like position that we don't punish sick people for being sick. If Limbaugh's potential legal problems lead him to that conclusion -- for others as well as himself -- then they'll have turned out to be a good thing. 

<p>I hope he's guilty. And, although he'd be immensely popular in prison -- a natural constituency for him -- I hope he gets away with it.
