<p>Progressive Muslims have often observed that the United States is a country with few Muslims but much Islam, whereas the Middle East is home to many Muslims but very little Islam. 

<p>It is an observation that ascribes to Islam a fundamental belief in human rights, pluralism, freedom of expression, women's equality, intellectual inquiry and democracy -- values embodied by the U.S. Constitution and championed by most Americans, yet abandoned and betrayed by most Middle East leaders. 

<p>Hence, when studying U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, one is struck with similar observations: Policies are executed in the name of 280 million Americans, yet they miss the very point of America. 

<p>It is said that nations have no morals, only interests. Some argue that foreign policy is the domain of realpolitik -- might makes right, pragmatism trumps idealism. Moral and ethical considerations are derided as irrelevant, naive, the anguish of bleeding-heart liberals not suited to the harsh, untrustworthy world in which we live. 

<p>And so, to advocate a genuinely American foreign policy, one premised on American values and beliefs, is to invite reminders that America has changed since Sept. 11, 2001. More specifically, America's relationship to the Arab and Muslim worlds has changed. Implicit in that statement is the assumption we're somehow following a new script, undeterred from exhibiting force and demonstrating our will, no longer squeamish in the face of adversity. But changes in tone and posture hardly constitute an overhaul of alignments and priorities. 

<p>For the record, I am adamant in the belief that the United States has a responsibility to be vigilant and aggressive in the war against terrorism. Efforts aimed at eradicating a global terrorist infrastructure, and holding accountable the governments, organizations and individuals that support that infrastructure, have my support. Americans deserve nothing less than full peace and security, both at home and abroad. 

<p>Integral to that peace and security is the safeguarding and expansion (not curtailment) of our civil liberties. 

<p>I am also adamant about preserving that which makes the United States a beacon of hope for peoples around the world. The oft whispered refrain to the ubiquitous "Yankee go home" chant has long been, "and take me with you." It is a refrain rooted in the knowledge that the United States promises freedom, justice and opportunity -- all unimaginable in many other countries. I am enormously grateful to be a part of this great human experiment called America, 

a gratitude reinforced by my experiences living in the Middle East. 

<p>I also believe that the values we espouse at home, values being undermined and eroded by the Bush administration, must define our behavior abroad. Call me simplistic and starry-eyed, but America's poor standing in world opinion is directly related to the perceived amorality of this administration. Which brings me to the moral compass theory. America's interests (political, economic, strategic, cultural) are best served and realized when driven by moral impulses. 

<p>In presenting the case for war against Iraq, the Bush administrations relied on unsubstantiated allegations about weapons of mass destruction and links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. A third tier of the argument focused on the Iraqi regime's crimes against humanity (while conveniently ignoring our past complicity in sustaining that regime). It was the only argument that resonated powerfully for me and made the case for war a compelling and moral one, an argument vindicated by each new mass grave that is uncovered. While the jury's still out about Iraq's future government, and the extent of the U.S. occupation, I am hopeful that vicious totalitarianism will be consigned to Iraq's past. 

<p>On the issue of Israel and Palestine, the United States has made a moral case for decades about the need to assure Israel's security and survival, and it has defended the existence of the Jewish state on largely moral and humanitarian grounds. Unfortunately, U.S. policy-makers have shied away from launching an equally vigorous moral campaign on behalf of Palestinian national rights and against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 

<p>A cursory glance at America's two "special" friends in the Arab world -- Saudi Arabia and Egypt, both home to the Sept. 11 terrorists -- reveals the depravity of basing relationships solely on access to natural resources and/or strategic considerations, while paying scant attention to corrupt, oppressive and dictatorial practices. 

<p>All of this leads me to wonder what the Middle East would look like if only America acted more like Americans.
