<p>NO ONE ACCUSED Howard Dean of whistling Dixie in February when he tried to 
appeal to Southern white men or to Southern black people about Southern white 
men. <p>"You know all those white guys riding around with Confederate flags in 
the back of their pickup trucks? Well, their kids don't have health insurance 
either." <p>Dean said this before a group of African-Americans at a hamburger 
joint in Spartanburg, S.C. A Newsday story said, "This blunt appeal to a commonality 
of racial interests won the moment and a burst of applause." <p>That same month 
in Washington at the Democratic National Committee winter meeting, Dean said, 
"I intend to talk about race during this election in the South because the Republicans 
have been talking about it since 1968 in order to divide us. . . . White folks 
in the South who drive pickup trucks with Confederate flag decals in the back 
ought to be voting with us and not them, because their kids don't have health 
insurance either and their kids need better schools, too." <p>That brought a standing 
ovation. <p>That makes very curious the catcalls nine months later from Dean's 
rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. Last Saturday, Dean said in 
the Des Moines Register, "I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate 
flags in their pickup trucks. We can't beat George Bush unless we appeal to a 
broad cross-section of Democrats." <p>As if this was the first time they heard 
it, the other candidates drew crossbows. John Kerry said it was "craven." Joseph 
Lieberman said it was "reckless." Dick Gephardt said "I will be the candidate 
for guys with American flags." <p>At this week's Rock the Vote forum in Boston, 
John Edwards told Dean, "The last thing we need in the South is somebody like 
you coming down and telling us what we need to do." Al Sharpton said Dean sounded 
"more like Stonewall Jackson than Jesse Jackson." Sharpton also said, "Maynard 
Jackson said that the Confederate flag is America's swastika. . . . I don't think 
you're a bigot, but I think that is insensitive." <p>That last dig showed how 
fast Sharpton and the Democratic candidates get lost without a compass. Maynard 
Jackson, Atlanta's first African-American mayor who died this summer, gave Dean 
some of the loudest applause at the DNC meeting. <p>"Dean blew the roof off today," 
Jackson said. "There was no mealy-mouth wishy-washiness about it. It was very 
gutsy." <p>Donna Brazile, the campaign manager for the 2000 presidential campaign 
of Al Gore and Lieberman, and no mealy-mouth herself, said Dean's words were "the 
medicine to cure my depression." Referring to the Democrats' fear of squarely 
taking on Bush's policies, Brazile, despite her neutrality, said, "Anybody who 
gets us off the floor and out of the fetal position, I'm for." <p>The Democrats 
should stop trying to mop the floor with Dean's Confederate flag and grab their 
opportunity before it is lost. There is a health care crisis that cuts across 
race. There is a public education crisis that cuts across race. There is a jobless 
economic "recovery" that cuts across race. The Republicans have successfully distracted 
huge swaths of white males from those problems, exploiting various codes that 
blame everyone except straight white men for America's problems. <p>In the Deep 
South, ties to the Confederacy remain a powerful political code. In 2001, white 
voters in Mississippi voted overwhelmingly to retain the current flag, which includes 
the Confederate symbol, over the wishes of African-American voters who wanted 
a new flag. This week, former Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour 
won the Mississippi governor's race after defiantly refusing to disavow the use 
of his photo by the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group tied to the old 
segregationist white citizens councils. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney came 
to Mississippi to campaign for Barbour. <p>While Barbour played to the code, Dean 
was trying to crack it. Some political analysts talk as if the white South is 
locked up forever for the Republicans. Had the Democrats won just one other state 
in 2000, Bush would not be in the White House. Clinton had the economic message 
to win several Southern states in both 1992 and 1996. <p>Dean has since apologized 
for invoking Confederate imagery. He should drop the Confederate line because 
it risks its own distraction, narrowly stereotyping Southern white males when 
too many white men all across America, broadly stereotyped as "NASCAR dads," have 
been persuaded to vote for codes against their best economic interests. <p>Dean 
should not drop the cause. The real apology should come from the other Democratic 
candidates for not joining it. Dean was the first to get off the floor to say 
the Democrats cannot win unless they tell white men how code politics is killing 
them in the pocketbook. Back in February, Maynard Jackson said Dean's bluntness 
"stole the show." The other candidates are merely jealous that Dean stole the 
issue of white men while they are still talking their way out of the fetal position.
