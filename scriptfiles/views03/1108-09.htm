<p>President George W. Bush’s November 6 speech before the National Endowment 
for Democracy emphasizing the need for greater democracy and freedom in the Arab 
world, while containing a number of positive aspects, was nevertheless very misleading 
and all-too characteristic of the longstanding contradictory messages that have 
plagued U.S. policy in the Middle East. <p> On the positive side, President Bush 
challenged the racist mythology that Islamic societies were somehow incapable 
of democracy and recognized that greater political pluralism need not follow a 
U.S. model. <p> Yet he failed even once to say a critical word about any non-democratic 
U.S. ally in the region. It is noteworthy, for example, that he called for spreading 
freedom “from Damascus to Tehran” but not from Riyadh to Cairo. <p> President 
Bush praised Morocco for recently allowing for relatively-competitive parliamentary 
elections, but said nothing about the regime’s ongoing savage repression in Moroccan-occupied 
Western Sahara. His praise for reforms in the U.S.-backed sultanates in Bahrain 
and Oman ignored ongoing suppression of peaceful demonstrators, unfair trials, 
the use of torture by security services and the jailing of political dissidents. 
<p> In citing the enormous poverty and political repression in the Middle East, 
President Bush correctly observed that “These are not the failures of a culture 
or a religion. These are the failures of political and economic doctrines.” However, 
some of the most damaging doctrines have come from the United States. For example, 
the neo-liberal economic doctrines imposed by the United States on a number of 
Middle Eastern countries in return for foreign aid or the restructuring of debts 
have in many cases actually increased poverty and in virtually every case greatly 
exacerbated economic inequality. Similarly, through the Truman Doctrine and Eisenhower 
Doctrine to the Carter Doctrine, Reagan Doctrine and Bush Doctrine, U.S. policy 
has propped up scores of repressive regimes against their own people through large-scale 
military, financial and diplomatic support. <p> President Bush’s review of history 
was also incredibly misleading. He referred to worldwide trends in democratization 
that began in the 1970s, when “Portugal and Spain and Greece held free elections. 
Soon, there were new democracies in Latin America and free institutions were spreading 
in Korea and Taiwan and in East Asia.” What the president failed to mention was 
that the United States was a major supporter of the Portuguese, Spanish and Greek 
dictatorships, as well as dictatorial regimes in Taiwan, South Korea and Latin 
America, thereby retarding their long-overdue transitions to democracy. <p> President 
Bush even claimed that the United States, particularly under President Ronald 
Reagan, was somehow responsible for these democratic trends in that the U.S. “created 
the conditions in which new democracies could flourish.” In reality, during this 
period the United States sent more military and police aid to more dictatorships 
than any other nation. <p> He cited “the difficult battles of Korea and Vietnam” 
as examples of Americans’ willingness to “sacrifice for liberty,” even though 
Syngman Rhee’s regime in South Korea and Nguyen Van Thieu’s regime in South Vietnam, 
for which U.S. forces were fighting, were actually brutal military dictatorships. 
<p> Such mythology was used as backdrop to President Bush’s claim that the U.S. 
invasion and occupation of Iraq was for “the peace of Iraq and for the security 
of free nations.” Despite growing opposition to the U.S. occupation within Iraq 
and around the world and demands that the United States quickly turn administration 
of the country over to the United Nations or to the Iraqis themselves, President 
Bush claimed that any failure of the U.S. mission “would embolden terrorists around 
the world and increase dangers to the American people and extinguish the hopes 
of millions in the region.” <p> In reality, according to Amnesty International, 
“Since the rhetoric about war in Iraq began, and through the war itself, human 
rights have suffered significantly worldwide” and that “the politics around the 
war have ensnared millions of people, rendering them pawns as relationships between 
nations were forged into new strategic alliances.” In announcing its 2003 human 
rights report, Amnesty reported, “While the overthrow of Saddam Hussein has brought 
greater freedom for the Iraqi people, the politics and distraction of the war 
in Iraq have had unintended, negative consequences for millions of people worldwide.” 
<p> In what some segments of the media have indicated may be a significant shift 
in policy, President Bush stated that:<p> “Sixty years of Western nations excusing 
and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle East did nothing to make us 
safe, because in the long run stability cannot be purchased at the expense of 
liberty. As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish, 
it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment and violence ready for export… 
. Therefore the United States has adopted a new policy: a forward strategy of 
freedom in the Middle East.” <p> Few people familiar with the Middle East could 
disagree with his observation that support for dictatorial regimes has not led 
to greater stability. However, there are no indications that the Bush Administration 
is planning to stop its support for governments that deny freedom or otherwise 
promote freedom in the region. <p> It is hypocritical in the extreme to state 
that “Many Middle Eastern governments now understand that military dictatorship 
and theocratic rule are a straight, smooth highway to nowhere, but some governments 
still cling to the old habits of central control” when the United States is the 
primary backer of such regimes in the region. <p> It is worth looking briefly 
at the reality of U.S. policy in the Middle East from the perspective of human 
rights and democracy. <p><B>U.S. Support for Repression in the Middle East </B><p> 
Rampant double standards have long plagued U.S. policy in the Middle East. American 
officials roundly condemned Iraqi repression of its Kurdish minority (at least 
after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait) while, just to the north, the United 
States has armed Turkish forces in their repression of Turkey’s Kurdish minority. 
Strict enforcement of reactionary interpretations of Islamic law by Iranian authorities 
are highlighted as examples of the perfidy of that regime, while even more draconian 
measures enacted in Saudi Arabia are downplayed or even rationalized as inherently 
part of their culture. The right of self-determination for Kuwaiti Arabs while 
under Iraqi occupation was vigorously defended, but not the right of Palestinian 
Arabs under Israeli occupation or Sahrawi Arabs under Moroccan occupation. Martial 
law in NATO ally Turkey during the 1980s was largely supported even as martial 
law in the Warsaw Pact nation of Poland during that same period was strongly condemned 
and resulted in U.S. sanctions. <p> Despite Bush Administration efforts to highlight 
repression in Iran, it is noteworthy that the United States was responsible for 
the overthrow of that country’s secular democratic government in 1953 and armed 
and trained the Shah’s brutal secret police for the next quarter century. The 
United States even quietly supported Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime during the 
1980s, the height of the Iraqi dictator’s repression. <p> U.S. aid to Israel and 
Morocco has generally increased as these governments’ repression in their occupied 
territories has worsened. The United States largely welcomed the 1992 military 
coup in Algeria that nullified that country’s first democratic elections, even 
as it led to a bloody civil war. American forces failed to stop widespread repression, 
even lynchings, of Palestinian residents of Kuwait immediately after the country’s 
liberation from Iraq. <p> Rather than encourage democratization in the Middle 
East, the United States has reduced – or maintained at low levels – its economic, 
military, and diplomatic support of Arab countries that have experienced substantial 
liberalization in recent years. For example, Jordan received large-scale U.S. 
support in the 1970s and 1980s despite widespread repression and authoritarian 
rule. In the early 1990s, when it became perhaps the most democratic country in 
the Arab world – with a relatively free press, opposition political parties, and 
lively debate in a parliament that wielded real political power within a constitutional 
monarchy – the United States suspended foreign aid. Similarly, aid to Yemen was 
cut off within months of the newly reunified country’s first democratic election 
in 1990. By contrast, American support for dictatorial regimes – such as Egypt, 
Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf emirates – increased during this period. <p> 
Rather than disliking American democracy, most Middle Easterners are envious of 
it and are resentful that the American attitude seems to be that they are somehow 
not deserving of it. It is ironic that the anti-terrorist coalition the United 
States has built for its military response to the September 2001 attacks – centered 
around alliances with the absolute monarchy in Saudi Arabia, the military regime 
of Pakistan and the crypto-Communists that rule Uzbekistan – was labeled “Operation 
Enduring Freedom.” <p> Before taking seriously any claims that the United States 
is really interested in freedom in that part of the world, it is appropriate to 
look at some of the specific countries the United States considers its allies: 
<p> <B>Case #1: Saudi Arabia and the Gulf: </B><p> One of the many ironies in 
U.S. Middle East policy is that a nation founded in one of the world’s first republican 
revolutions is now the major backer of the world’s few remaining absolute monarchies. 
For the past twenty years, the United States has been on record that it is willing 
to use military force to repel not just external aggression against U.S. allies 
in the Gulf, but internal challenges as well. There is little question that U.S. 
economic and military support has kept the hereditary rulers of the Middle East 
in power as despots far longer than a more natural evolution of social change 
would have otherwise allowed. <p> Indeed, the most important American ally in 
the Islamic world is the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is run exclusively by 
a royal family that allows no public dissent or independent press. Those who dare 
challenge the regime or its policies are punished severely. There is no constitution, 
no political parties and no legislature. It was under such an environment of repression 
that Osama Bin Laden and most of his followers first emerged. <p> The United States 
has helped perpetuate the rule of absolute monarchs in the Persian Gulf through 
billions of dollars in military sales and generous arrangements for economic investments. 
Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has demonstrated outright hostility towards democratic 
trends in neighboring Yemen – the only republic on the Arabian Peninsula – with 
no apparent American objections. <p> Support for these family dictatorships has 
been a prevailing theme of U.S. policy for several decades, a view shared by the 
British when they were the dominant outside power. According to Harold Macmillan, 
who served as prime minister in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it is “rather 
sad that circumstances compel us to support reactionary and really rather outmoded 
regimes because we know that the new forces, even if they begin with moderate 
opinions, always seem to drift into violent revolutionary and strongly anti-Western 
positions.” More bluntly, F. Gregory Gause III, a contemporary specialist on Saudi 
Arabia at the University of Vermont, noted how “The truth is the more democratic 
the Saudis become, the less cooperative they will be with us. So why should we 
want that?” <p> British-based journalist and author Dilip Hiro describes how the 
United States does not support democracy in the Middle East because “it is much 
simpler to manipulate a few ruling families – to secure fat orders for arms and 
ensure that oil price remains low – than a wide variety of personalities and policies 
bound to be thrown up by a democratic system.” In particular, says Hiro, elected 
governments might reflect the popular sentiment for “self-reliance and Islamic 
fellowship.” <p> <B>Case #2: Uzbekistan and Central Asia: </B><p> In recent years, 
the United States has rationalized its support for autocratic regimes in the Middle 
East, North Africa and Central Asia as a regrettable but necessary means of suppressing 
the Islamic opposition. In many respects, this policy closely parallels the decades 
of support during the Cold War of repressive right-wing governments in the name 
of anti-Communism. The result is similar, however: the lack of open political 
expression only encourages large segments of the oppressed populations to ally 
with an underground – and often violent and authoritarian – opposition movement. 
<p> Ironically, in some cases – such as Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and 
Turkmenistan – the United States has even allied with old-line Communist Party 
bosses from the Soviet era who are still in power as a means of countering the 
growth of Islamic movements in those countries. (This contrasts with previous 
decades, when the United States supported such Islamic movements to counter the 
Communists.) This comes despite the fact that, in part because of the strong Sufi 
influence, most Islamic movements in Central Asia – with the notable exception 
of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) – are actually fairly progressive 
and moderate as compared with some of their Middle Eastern and North African counterparts. 
<p> In the case of Uzbekistan – the United States’ closest ally in the region 
– the radical orientation of its Islamic opposition is a direct result the Karimov 
regime’s imprisonment and torture of nonviolent Muslims who dared to worship outside 
of state controls. Attacks by the dictatorship’s armed forces against the IMU 
have resulted in widespread civilian casualties, not just within Uzbekistan, but 
also in neighboring Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Amnesty International has documented 
widespread human rights violations during the 2001 counter-insurgency campaign, 
where “villages were set on fire and bombed, livestock were killed, houses and 
fields destroyed.” However, the U.S. State Department saw the Karimov regime’s 
actions quite differently, declaring “The United States supports the right of 
Uzbekistan to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the violent 
actions of the IMU, and commends the measures in the course of the current incursions 
to minimize casualties and ensure the protection of innocent civilians.” <p> <B>Case 
#3: Egypt: </B><p> The United States has traditionally justified its support for 
authoritarian regimes on the grounds that the alternatives would be worse: during 
the Cold War, the fear was from forces of the left and, more recently, it has 
come from anti-American Islamists. However, the United States is also quite willing 
to support Middle Eastern governments that suppress liberal democratic movements. 
<p> A particularly vivid example of this lack of concern for democracy involves 
Egypt, by far the largest Arab country. In May 2001, the increasing authoritarianism 
of U.S.-backed dictator Hosni Mubarak was demonstrated in the quick conviction 
of Dr. Saad El-Din Ibrahim and twenty-seven associates in what was widely seen 
as a serious blow against Egypt’s burgeoning pro-democracy movement. Dr. Ibrahim 
and his colleagues served with the Ibn Khaldun Center for Developmental Studies, 
a think tank dedicated to the promotion of civil society in Egypt and throughout 
the Arab world. In 2000, the Egyptian government shut down this internationally 
renowned center, known for its study of applied social sciences in Egypt and the 
Arab world. Its monthly publication, Civil Society, had been an important source 
of information and analysis for scholars across the globe. The Center had also 
engaged in the monitoring of elections and providing workshops in civic education. 
Though these harsh sentences were eventually overturned, the closure of the center 
and the jailing of its staff was clearly intended to deter other academics from 
pursuing similar research and related activities, thereby limiting the free exchange 
of ideas crucial to advancing political pluralism in Egypt and other Arab countries. 
<p> The convictions were the latest in a series of repressive government measures 
against other Egyptian scholars, democrats, and human rights activists, as well 
as gays and feminists. The Ibn Khaldun Center advocated just the kind of liberal 
democratic values that U.S. foreign policy supposedly upholds, yet there no threatened 
cutoff or reduction in U.S. foreign aid, on which the Egyptian regime is very 
dependent, or other direct pressure from the United States. <p> Egypt’s corrupt 
and autocratic government is the second largest recipient of U.S. economic and 
military assistance in the world, surpassed only by Israel. Concerns by pro-democracy 
groups in Egypt and human rights organizations in the United States that such 
aid is only making further repression possible has been rejected by the State 
Department, that still insists such aid is necessary to “push the peace march 
forward.” As long as the Mubarak regime knows that U.S. aid will flow regardless 
of its violations of internationally recognized human rights, there is little 
incentive for political liberalization. The growing anti-American sentiment in 
Egypt stems not as much from U.S. support for Israel as it does from U.S. support 
for Mubarak’s dictatorial rule. <p> <B>Case #4: Turkey: </B><p> Turkey has struggled 
to build democratic institutions despite the constant threats from its military 
to take over the government, as it has on several previous occasions in the past 
with U.S. support. The Bush Administration has at best mixed feelings about Turkish 
democracy. After the Turkish government balked at U.S. requests to support the 
invasion of Iraq, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, in a speech before 
Turkish cadets, hinted that the military might need to take unilateral action 
since the civilian government made a "big, big mistake” in failing to back U.S. 
military plans and that democratically-elected parliament “didn't quite know what 
it was doing.” <p> For over fifty years, the Turkish republic has received large-scale 
military, economic, and diplomatic support from the United States. At NATO’s southeastern 
flank, Turkey’s strategic location relative to both the former Soviet Union and 
the Middle East made that country, after Israel and Egypt, the largest recipient 
of U.S. foreign aid – primarily military – in recent decades. Direct grants of 
armaments were phased out only as recently as 1998; arms sales to and ongoing 
strategic cooperation with Turkey continues. <p> Turkey has yet to acknowledge 
its genocide against its Armenian population over eighty years ago in which over 
one million civilians were slaughtered. In order to please its Turkish client, 
the U.S. government has refused to publicly acknowledge that the genocide even 
took place, despite the widespread historic documentation of the atrocities. <p> 
In 1974, Turkish troops, armed with American weapons, seized the northern 40 percent 
of the island nation of Cyprus and engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing against 
the ethnic Greek population. As many as 2000 civilians were killed. The United 
Nations Security Council condemned the invasion and called for Turkey’s immediate 
withdrawal. However, the United States blocked the imposition of international 
sanctions to force the Turks to pull out. Congress immediately cut off aid to 
Turkey in response to the invasion and occupation, but aid was restored three 
years later after strong pressure from President Jimmy Carter on the grounds that 
a resumption of aid would make it easier to convince the Turks to withdraw. Decades 
later, however, Turkish troops remain, still occupying much of the northern part 
of the country – now declared an independent Turkish Cypriot state but not recognized 
by any country besides Turkey – and the island remains divided. <p> The Greek 
Cypriots are not the only victims of U.S.-backed Turkish armed forces. The fifteen 
million strong Kurdish minority, located primarily in the eastern part of the 
country, has suffered enormously under Turkish rule. There have been periods when 
simply speaking the Kurdish language or celebrating Kurdish festivals has been 
severely repressed. In addition to being denied basic cultural and political rights, 
Kurdish civilians have been the primary victims of a Turkish counter-insurgency 
campaign ostensibly targeted at the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), a Marxist-led 
guerrilla group fighting for greater autonomy. The Turkish regime capitalized 
on the PKK’s use of terrorism as an excuse to crush even nonviolent expressions 
of Kurdish nationalism. The United States has been largely silent regarding the 
Turkish government’s repression but quite vocal in condemning what is sees as 
Kurdish terrorism. <p> During the 1980s and 1990s, the United States supplied 
Turkey with $15 billion worth of armaments as the Turkish military carried out 
widespread attacks against civilian populations in the largest use of American 
weapons by non-U.S. forces since Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Most of this 
took place during President Bill Clinton’s first term. Over 3000 Kurdish villages 
were destroyed and over two million Kurds became refugees in an operation where 
more than three-quarters of the weapons were of U.S. origin. Human Rights Watch, 
which has also criticized the PKK rebels for serious human rights violations, 
has documented how the U.S.-supplied Turkish army was “responsible for the majority 
of forced evacuations and destruction of villages.” The fifteen-year war cost 
over 40,000 lives. <p> Such pandering to the Turkish government was rationalized 
during the Cold War as necessary to back a key ally that bordered the Soviet Union. 
Today, while this veneer is gone, the policy continues. <p> <B>Case #5: Israel 
</B><p>Israel has by far the strongest democratic institutions of any country 
in the Middle East. Unfortunately, such respect for individual freedom and human 
rights is largely restricted to areas within its internationally recognized borders 
and primarily to its Jewish citizens. Indeed, Israeli occupation forces in the 
Palestinian-populated West Bank and Gaza Strip are perpetrating some of the worst 
human rights violations taking place in the Middle East today, with the unconditional 
backing of the Bush Administration. <p> For the past decade, the United States 
has been virtually the only country to claim that the Geneva Convention pertaining 
to conduct by occupying powers does not apply to Israel. The United States also 
boycotted a recent meeting of the Fourth Geneva Convention that month at which 
Israel was reprimanded by 114 states – including Great Britain and other EU nations 
– for its “grave breaches” of the Geneva Convention, including indiscriminate 
and disproportionate use of violence against Palestinian civilians, among others. 
<p> Over the past thirty-five years, the United States has been one of only three 
dissenting votes in the General Assembly criticizing Israeli human rights at least 
six times and one of only two dissenting votes at least eight times. In the Security 
Council, the United States has been the sole dissenting vote, thereby vetoing 
resolutions critical of Israeli human rights violations, on at least eighteen 
occasions. <p> The United States has repeatedly blocked attempts by the United 
Nations to bring in unarmed human rights monitors or investigative committees 
into the occupied territories and has even vetoed resolutions criticizing Israeli 
killings of United Nations personnel. <p> Since the right-wing Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon came to power in February 2001, Israeli human rights abuses have 
increased further. The Israeli government has dispatched assassination squads, 
ranging from individuals with rifles to U.S.-supplied helicopter gun ships with 
missiles, to kill Palestinian activists. Some of these Palestinians have been 
wanted terrorists associated with radical Islamic groups responsible for the murder 
of Israeli civilians. Others have been civilian political leaders of Islamic organizations, 
members of left-wing groups, activists in the ruling Fatah party, and some for 
no apparent reason. One target was a teacher at a Catholic school who had been 
working closely with Israeli teachers on developing a joint conflict resolution 
curriculum. There have also been a number of innocent bystanders killed as well. 
Princeton international law professor Richard Falk, an American Jew who served 
on a fact finding commission dispatched to the occupied territories at the behest 
of the United Nations General Assembly during the winter of 2001, expressed criticism 
at Israel’s “seemingly random hit list.” The commission noted that such assassinations 
“are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 147, and of international 
humanitarian law.” Nevertheless, both Democratic and Republican Congressional 
leaders have gone on record supporting the Israeli assassination squads. <p> As 
the uprisings continued, the Palestinian resistance escalated to include armed 
attacks by Palestinian militiamen against Israeli occupation forces and settlers 
as well as terrorist attacks by extremist Islamic groups against Israeli settlers 
and against civilians inside Israel. Israeli repression increased as well, including 
killings of scores of Palestinian paramedics and other medical workers seeking 
to rescue the wounded in riots where the Israelis would respond with lethal force. 
In December 2001, the United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution strongly 
condemning Palestinian terrorism because it also criticized Israeli policies of 
assassinating Palestinian dissidents and imposing collective punishment against 
civilian populations. The United States was the only dissenter within the 15-member 
world body. <p> During Israel’s April 2002 offensive, UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees Mary Robinson reiterated her call for an end of the suicide bombings 
as well as an end to the occupation. She particularly criticized the Israelis 
for placing 600,000 Palestinians under a strict curfew for most of the month and 
the destruction of Palestinian medical, religious and service institutions in 
contravention of international law, as well as the use of Palestinian civilians 
as human shields. Robinson, a former president of Ireland, had been one of the 
most visible and effective commissioners in the history of the UN’s Human Rights 
Committee. In response to her criticisms of America’s most important Middle East 
ally, however, the United States – which has veto power over the re-appointment 
of top UN officials – forced her to step down at the end of her term. <p> On the 
same day as President Bush’s speech before the National Endowment for Democracy, 
a United Nations special committee investigating Israeli practices in the occupied 
territories reported that Israeli human rights abuses has reached an all-time 
high. Despite this, Congress has twice voted to increase military aid to Sharon’s 
government in recent months, effectively rewarding Israel for its repression. 
<p><B>Consequences of U.S. Policy: </B><p> Until the extent of the repression 
and the American complicity in the repression is recognized, it will be difficult 
to understand the negative sentiments a growing number of ordinary people in the 
Islamic world have towards the United States. Therefore, self-righteous claims 
by American leaders that the anger expressed by Arabs and Muslims towards the 
United States is because of “our commitment to freedom” only exacerbates feelings 
of ill-will and feeds the rage manifested in anti-American violence and terrorism. 
<p> To those in the Arab and Islamic world, U.S. defense of Israeli repression 
against their Palestinian brethren is perhaps the most sensitive of a whole series 
of grievances regarding American callousness towards internationally-recognized 
human rights in the Middle East. Yet it is the U.S. support of repression by regimes 
of Islamic countries that Muslims know the best. Morocco and Turkey, like Israel, 
have utilized American weapons in the occupation and repression of other peoples. 
Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Islamic countries have suffered under 
autocratic rule maintained, in varying degrees, through American military, economic 
and diplomatic support. <p> However, to link arms transfers with the human rights 
records of America’s Middle East allies, for example, would lead to the loss of 
tens of billions of dollars worth of sales for American arms manufacturers, which 
are among the most powerful special interest groups in Washington. With the exception 
of Israel, none of America’s allies in the region could really be considered democracies, 
yet none require democratic institutions in order to fulfill American strategic 
objectives. Most observers acknowledge that close strategic cooperation with the 
United States tends to be unpopular in Arab countries, as are government policies 
that devote large amounts of public expenditures towards the acquisition of weapons, 
most of which are of American origin. Were these leaders subjected to the will 
of the majority, they would likely be forced to greatly reduce arms purchases 
from and strategic cooperation with the United States. <p> In short, democracy 
among Middle Eastern countries is seen as potentially damaging to American policy 
goals. At the same time, now that administration claims of Iraqi weapons of mass 
destruction and links to Al-Qaeda are widely recognized as false, support for 
democracy is one of the few rationales the administration has left for its invasion 
and occupation of Iraq. Whether this will indeed force the U.S. government to 
change its policies remains to be seen. As long as misleading statements regarding 
the U.S. commitment to democracy, as those in President Bush’s November 6 address, 
remain unchallenged, such a change will be very unlikely. <p><I>Stephen Zunes
