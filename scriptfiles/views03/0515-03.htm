<p>On the heels of war, when more and more of the world's citizens live in fear, we desperately need stronger support for human rights and democracy, fewer nuclear weapons, and more international cooperation. Yet in the past few weeks, protestors in Iraq have been killed by US soldiers, the Pentagon is taking steps to develop new nuclear weapons, and the administration is further undermining the UN.



<p>The recent shootings by US soldiers of protesters in Falluja are one example of how the US is undermining democracy in Iraq. While it is possible that shots were fired at the soldiers first, the results of the conflict (as many as 17 Iraqis died in the two shootings) solidly indicate a disproportionate use of force. The incident is reminiscent of the Israeli occupation, and like that conflict the US occupation of Iraq threatens to devolve into a dangerous cycle of resentment, hatred and violence.



<p>Here at home, the administration's pursuit of a new generation of nuclear weapons may ultimately result in more countries with illicit nuclear programs. The Pentagon seeks to make new, so-called "low-yield" and "bunker buster" nuclear weapons.  The low-yield nukes would be approximately a third the size of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, and may lower the threshold for the actual use of nuclear weapons.  The "bunker busters" may be many times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The creation of a new generation of US nuclear weapons will provoke a reaction from other nations -especially those already vulnerable under the doctrine of preemption -and could set off a proliferation free-for-all.  Congress is currently addressing these issues.



<p>Afghan citizens recently held the first anti-American rally since the US drove the Taliban from power.  The protest in Kabul focused on the weakness of the current Afghan government, along with the extreme poverty many Afghans face.  The administration's disdain for one of the traditional roles of the UN, in stabilizing and reconstructing war-torn nations, is limiting the potential for steady, healthy governments in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The citizens of these countries are suffering because of it.  US disregard for UN leadership is weakening the institution - an institution that most Americans support.



<p>Is this the world Americans want? Not according to scores of us. Americans believe in democracy and human rights. We aspire to a world free from the nuclear threat. We support the United Nations and the principles of international cooperation for which it stands.



<p>These values, intimately tied to our country's identity, should define our relationship with the world. The world's perception of Americans, caused by the dangerous actions of the Bush administration, will continue to get uglier until we, unequivocally, reshape it.



<p>We need a drastic change in 2004.  As progressives throughout the nation work to alter the political landscape of this country, we must also ensure that when we get to 2004 we aren't replacing one bad foreign policy with a slightly less bad version.



<p>The millions of Americans who protested the war on Iraq, and the thousands who continue to organize in their own communities, are proof of our chance to create a new foreign policy for this county. This is why Peace Action's Campaign for a New Foreign Policy is demonstrating to Republicans, Democrats, and others that we need better leadership on foreign affairs and that we won't accept excuses for inaction.



<p>By pressuring our members of Congress to sign on to a Pledge for a New Foreign Policy we send a clear message to those in office (and to those who want to be in office): you won't get our support unless a new vision for American foreign policy -one based on human rights and democracy, a serious commitment to disarmament, and international cooperation -is at the top of your agenda.



<p>We need a new foreign policy.  We must demand no less from those who represent us, as the victims of our foreign policy deserve no less from us.
