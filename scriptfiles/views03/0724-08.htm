<p>When we marched against the WTO and the corporate trade regime in 
Seattle in 1999, we marched together.

<p>When we stood together against the war with Iraq, half-a-million strong 
in New York City, and 15 million strong throughout the world, we stood 
together.

<p>When we fought the badly-named "Patriot Act," we fought it together -- 
and I was the only one running who voted against it.

<p>When we tried to stop this war from starting, we fought it together -- 
and I was able to pull together 126 of my colleagues to vote no to war 
last fall, working with my friend and ally Barbara Lee, as Co-Chairs of 
the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

<p>We stand together in opposition to the death penalty; in support of 
living wages; in support of boosting alternative energy rather than wars

for oil; in support of medicinal marijuana; in opposition to corporate 
hog farming; in support of organic farming; in opposition to nukes in 
space; in opposition to Star Wars; in support of cutting the military 
budget by 15% and applying those funds to public education.

<p>We stand together for national health insurance, Canadian style. We 
stand together on public financing of campaigns, on same day voter 
registration, on instant runoff voting. We stand together on civil 
rights, and equal rights, and human rights. We stand together on voting 
reforms for ex-felons. We stand together on ending the trade and travel 
embargoes on Cuba. We stand together in opposition to the current war on

drugs, which is all too often a war on the urban poor.

<p>We stand together in demanding that publicly-owned clean water is a 
human right. We stand together in demanding that the developing world's 
debt be forgiven, as if it were still the Jubilee Year; and that we act 
seriously to build a world in which arms sales decline, hunger declines,

poverty declines, and human rights increase.

<p>We stand together on rejoining the rest of the world, and signing the 
Kyoto Treaty, the International Criminal Court Treaty, the Land Mines 
Ban Treaty, and all the rest of the treaties and agreements and working 
relationships that the current Administration has so cavalierly tossed 
aside.

<p>We stand together in opposition to excessive CEO salaries; in opposition

to offshore tax havens for corporations; in support of real pension 
reforms, real SEC enforcement, real crackdowns on corporate scofflaws. 
And we stand together in opposition to sweetheart deals for corporate 
friends of this Administration, whether it's Enron wrecking California 
for profit, the drug companies ripping off seniors and HIV patients and 
poor people for profit, or Halliburton ripping off Iraqi oil revenues 
for profit.

<p>I am a Democrat, but I understand that Greens and Nader voters are not 
just liberal Democrats. Still, I note that in Europe, even when 
political parties disagree on issues, they are often able to work 
together with each other in coalition. I'd like to raise that 
possibility again today. And I note that Ralph Nader has suggested that 
my candidacy is worth supporting.

<p>We all know we will do better if we work together. Perhaps we can find 
common ground on issues and principles. I would like to open up that 
possibility. And I would like to ask that you give serious consideration

to my candidacy for President. Because a better world is still possible.


<p><i>Rep. Kucinich is a presidential candidate and co-chair of the 
    <a href="http://bernie.house.gov/pc/" target="_new">    Congressional Progressive Caucus</a>.
