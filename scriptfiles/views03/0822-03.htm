<p>IT IS EASY to see why President Bush does not take the environment seriously. No, I am not thinking about the fact that the White House is a self-service station for Exxon/Mobil. It is far more elementary than that. The president simply does not spend enough time in the environment to appreciate it. Our president did his best to appear earnest last weekend in California,plopping down by helicopter in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation area. He shoveled some dirt, took a short walk, and lofted some words to the heavens. "We want to respect nature and honor God's great gift to our country by conserving these beautiful properties all across the country," he said.

<p>Bush hopped back into his helicopter to make it back to Orange County for a $2,000-a-plate lunch. He might have praised God in the temple of the mountains, but the collection plate was in the concrete burbs. Pardon, but we do have to pull into the service station long enough to observe that a Republican fillup includes the premium fuel of $46 million from oil and gas companies in the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, while Democrats got a low-octane $12 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In California, the vast majority of cash from Chevron/Texaco and Atlantic Richfield went to the GOP.


<p>As Bush soars toward $250 million for his reelection campaign, he continues to leave behind a landscape aching for more respect. Early in his presidency, he promised $5 billion over five years to repair facilities in national parks. Bush has "spent" $2.9 billion so far, but $2.5 billion of it was not new money. It was merely siphoned off from other park projects and services such as visitor education, species tracking and, ironically, trail maintenance. Bush might have held a shovel for a photo op, but when no one was looking, he kicked the dirt right back into the hole.

<p>The real problem, I suspect, is that Bush does not give himself the time to truly sink into the woods, climb the mountains, paddle the rivers, and find that special place or moment where you really understand what God's gift is.

<p>As an example, I was with my wife and two friends in July at Lakes of the Clouds hut of the Appalachian Mountain Club. Anyone who has been there knows what an almost alien feeling it is up there at just over 5,000 feet. I've been at Lakes at times of toe-chilling 30-something degrees and sustained 80-mile-an-hour winds. While your windows rattle, you could look down with binoculars to the Mount Washington Resort and see golfers in shorts, bathed in 80-degree sun.

<p>I've noted the vast gulf between valley and mountaintop many times in my hikes. This summer, as Bush continues to run away from global warming seriously, I felt a particular awe as to how thin our air -- and our existence -- is.

<p>Down there, a little less than 1 mile below, people cavort in shorts. One mile up, I'm in a down jacket and a wool hat. One more mile up, if you were on a Sierra crest, some people might get altitude sickness. Another mile up and on most mountains around the world, you are in permanent snow and glaciers. Another mile up, 20,000 feet, you have to acclimate for several days if you are making a Himalayan ascent. Another mile up and you are in the death zone.

<p>All that difference. It seems so far, so tall, so formidable. And yet, if you laid that distance down flat on a map, that 6 miles would not even cover the distance along the Charles River from the Science Museum to Watertown Square. In Chicago, it would not come close to equaling the distance of the urban Lakefront bikeway. It would not cover the 7 miles it takes for me to get from my house to the Globe, which by car takes about 20 minutes.

<p>Sometimes, it's those simple recognitions that give you the greatest awe. Bush has clearly not had that moment. Bill and Hillary Clinton once took a White House vacation to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons where they actually camped in a tent for a night and went on an 8-mile hike. The Clintons ended up protesting a proposed nearby gold mine.

<p>Perhaps the moment will come when something that Bush loves at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, is no longer there. He brags about being able to jog in inhospitable 100-degree heat, but just maybe, when something he is used to disappears, a cactus, a flower, a cricket song, he will realize how we have abused the hospitality of the planet. He just might get that awe. That is our best hope for him to take the environment seriously. He needs the awe to forget about the oil.
