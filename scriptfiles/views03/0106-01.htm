<p>Trent Lott's recent comments embracing America's segregationist past rightly prompted a public outcry over minority rights. What no one seems to be noticing, though &#151; much less crying out about &#151; is the slow but steady assault on women's rights happening under our current president. <P>

Here's just a partial roundup:<P>

A Bush favorite for the chairmanship of the Food and Drug Administration is W. David Hager, a physician who wants to ban RU-486, refuses to insert IUDs and balks at prescribing birth control pills to single women. If Hager makes you nervous, just watch what happens when Bush appoints a new Supreme Court justice.<P>

The Bush administration withheld a previously approved $34 million from the United Nations Population Fund, which provides family planning (<I>not </I>abortion) to impoverished  women the world over, as well as maternal and prenatal care, HIV-AIDS prevention and the repair of fistula, a debilitating condition resulting from traumatic childbirth.<P>

The New York Times recently reported that Bush officials apparently censored Web sites of the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, removing language, respectively, that states the lack of evidence linking abortion to breast cancer and condom education to early sexual activity. Critics say Bush is distorting and suppressing scientific information for ideological ends.<P>

At a recent conference in Bangkok, Thailand, Bush administration officials sought to remove the terms &quot;reproductive rights&quot; and &quot;reproductive health services&quot; from a 1994 internationally embraced population-control accord, arguing the accord as is promotes abortion. (It doesn't; the document only calls for &quot;safe&quot; abortion in nations where it's already legal.) The delegation's efforts &#151; which failed &#151; placed them in the same camp as Islamic fundamentalists.<P>

Foes of reproductive choice recently launched a raft of proposed legislation designed to chip away at the constitutional right to abortion. They make no secret the ultimate goal is to overturn Roe v. Wade. With new Senate majority leader Dr. Bill Frist at the helm &#151; he opposes abortion and also emergency contraception and international family planning &#151; chances are excellent the legislation will pass.<P>

Women's advocates are passionate about reproductive autonomy because they know everything flows from it. When women can make informed, planned decisions about childbearing, everyone fares better &#151; their families, their communities, their nations. A single glance around the world confirms this. And you cannot separate the astounding progress women have made in this country in the past four decades &#151; we flow into colleges and universities, into workplaces, into public office &#151; from the untethering of biology to destiny, which lets women postpone marriage and childbirth until they're ready. <P>

As members of the GOP stumble over each other to showcase their racial sensitivity post-Lott, telling voters they don't want to return to an era of separate drinking fountains and drugstore dining counters, it seems many want to turn the gender clock back to the '50s, when a woman's place was in the home, teens lived in a state of (now deadly) sexual ignorance and females seeking abortions were forced into back alleys. &quot;I hope I live long enough to see insensitivity to women by our leaders get the anger it deserves,&quot; a female reader recently wrote to the New York Times. So do I.
