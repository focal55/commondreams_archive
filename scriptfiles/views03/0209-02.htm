<p>Secretary of State Colin Powell made a game effort to advance the case for war with Iraq in his appearance before the United Nations last week. But it should come as no surprise that seasoned diplomats representing France, Germany, China, Russia and other nations were unmoved by Powell&#039;s attempt to dress up tired Bush administration rhetoric in a cloak of supposedly significant new information.
<p>Powell&#039;s presentation failed on two accounts:
<p>The thin tissue of &#034;new&#034; information about the failure of Iraqi officials to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors merely made the case for providing more support for the inspection process. Much of the information that Powell provided is subject to interpretations that might differ from those the secretary of state offered. But if Powell&#039;s read is correct, then all of his evidence points to the conclusion that the weapons inspectors are looking in the right places and that they are having a very serious impact on the ground in Iraq. This conclusion, in turn, argues for stepping up inspections, rather than abandoning the process and moving toward a war footing.
<p>This is the point that French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin made when he responded to Powell&#039;s speech with a call for tripling the number of arms experts, opening more regional offices and using French Mirage war planes to help with searches.
<p>The majority of Americans want assurances that Saddam Hussein poses no threat to his neighbors or the world, but would like to get those assurances without sacrificing the lives of innocent Iraqis or American troops. They should recognize Villepin&#039;s proposal as the next logical step. Several congressional resolutions, including one sponsored by U.S. Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., seek to encourage a more reasoned approach and citizens should let their representatives know that the American people prefer aggressive inspections to war.
<p>To the extent that Powell tried to argue that there are genuine connections between Iraq&#039;s leaders and the al-Qaida terrorist network, he was wholly ineffectual. For all the indignation he tried to muster, Powell could not convince diplomats, who understand the doctrinal and political differences between Arab secularists like Saddam and Islamic extremists like Osama bin Laden, that such a connection exists. And his supposed &#034;evidence&#034; of a &#034;sinister nexus between Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network&#034; was instantaneously discredited.
<p>Powell attempted to hang his claim of a connection on the reports that a small, little-known terrorist group called Ansar al-Islam is operating within Iraq. As experts about the group and diplomats from countries allied with the United States noted, however, the region where Ansar al-Islam supposedly operates is a remote portion of the autonomous northern Kurdish territories in Iraq near the Iran border - a region <EM>not</EM> controlled by Saddam or the Iraqi military.
<p>Equally significant is evidence, unearthed by ABC News, which suggests that, far from being allies of Saddam, Ansar al-Islam&#039;s leaders seek to overthrow the Iraqi dictator.
<p>When all is said and done, it becomes clear that, as much as we all may respect Colin Powell, he did not make the case for this war at this time.
