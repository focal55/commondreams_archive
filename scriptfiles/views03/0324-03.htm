<p>Last week I found out that National Public Radio wants the opinions of 

antiwar activists -- as long as we follow the right script.

<p>After a day of antiwar protests on the University of Texas campus and in 

Austin, I found myself booked as a late-night guest on NPR’s all-day 

coverage of the war to be interviewed by Scott Simon, the popular host of 

Weekend Edition on Saturdays.

<p>I knew something about Simon’s politics from an essay he published in the 

Wall Street Journal a month after 9/11. In that piece he explained that he 

had become a Quaker and pacifist during the antiwar movement of the 1960s 

but now supported Bush’s “war on terrorism.” His prose at the time was 

undistinguishable from the president’s rhetoric:

<p>“But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our 

blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to 

risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not 

shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on 

America’s military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions 

are not apparent.”

<p>So, when I found out Simon would be interviewing me, I had an idea of what 

to expect: The liberal defense of the American empire that one hears from 

people who have accepted the idea that we now intervene only for 

“humanitarian” or defensive reasons, and besides everything is different 

since 9/11. These people would never be so crude as to try to silence 

antiwar activists or question their patriotism; instead, they prefer to 

indulge our naiveté with that “someday you will understand” look. Even 

though I was not in the studio with him, I could feel that look on Simon’s 

face through the phone line.

<p>After the first question, it was clear Simon expected me to follow a script 

that would go something like this: Yes, I’m against this war, but I know 

that Saddam Hussein is such a monster that nothing short of war can deal 

with him. Yes, I’m against this war, but now that the president has made 

this decision we should unify as a nation. Yes, I’m against this war, but 

-- in the end -- I realize that I should acknowledge that I am a naïve and 

foolish person who can’t deal the harsh realities of a harsh world.

<p>Well, I didn’t follow the script, and it wasn’t long before it was clear in 

Simon’s voice that he wasn’t pleased.

<p>Instead of accepting the assumptions built into his pro-war framework, I 

challenged them. I agreed that Hussein was a totalitarian thug, but argued 

that had little to do with why the Bush administration had pressed for a 

war. I talked of U.S. plans for empire and the longstanding U.S. project of 

controlling the Middle East as a source of strategic power in the world. I 

referred to the Bush administration’s own <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html" target="_new">National Security Strategy 

document</a>, which lays out a plan 

for U.S. dominance, and the U.S. military Space Command’s <a href="http://www.gsinstitute.org/resources/extras/vision_2020.pdf" target="_new">plans for 

controlling space</a>.

<p>With each point I made, Simon returned to some version of, “Yes, but 

certainly you must acknowledge …”

<p>But I never did acknowledge what he wanted me to -- not out of obstinacy 

but because I thought he was wrong. When it came time to take callers, 

Simon didn’t invite me to stay on the line, even though it was clear that 

he and I could have engaged in a lively exchange with listeners. After 

going off the air, I listened to the callers and was amused by the way 

Simon tried to spin my comments and put back in place the proper pro-war 

framework.

<p>Since 9/11, I have been interviewed about antiwar politics hundreds of 

times on radio and television, including on a number of right-wing shows. I 

have been invited back on several of those conservative shows, where the 

hosts generally don’t mind a guest who strongly disagrees (although they 

keep tight control over their shows and generally like to get the last word).

<p>But I don’t expect ever to be invited back on a show hosted by Scott Simon. 

He might argue that is because my ideas are so crazy that they don’t 

deserve a hearing. But what Simon either doesn’t know -- or doesn’t want to 

know -- is that the analysis I offered that night is hardly unique to me.

<p>Simon should acknowledge that millions of people around the country and the 

world share a radical analysis of this war for oil and empire. And they are 

growing increasingly weary of the condescension of liberals.
