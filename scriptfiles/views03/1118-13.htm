<p>Howard Dean is in trouble for uttering a sentiment that most Democrats keep 
to themselves. Dean remarked that he wanted the votes of the guys with pickup 
trucks and Confederate flags on the back. He has been accused of pandering to 
racists. Howard Dean is not my candidate, but he is getting a bum rap. No Dem- 
ocrat is likely to win without large numbers of white working-class male votes, 
the so-called Reagan Democrats. The question is how to get these votes in ways 
that expand our most generous instincts rather than cave in to defensive and self-destructive 
fears. <p>Bill Clinton avoided Dean's rhetoric, but he had the same goal when 
he denounced provocative rappers in the 1992 election. Tragically, Clinton aimed 
to recapture Reagan Democrats by eagerly inflicting the death penalty and by placing 
strict limits on welfare. Yet Clinton's victory also depended heavily on economic 
issues. The administration of the first George Bush succumbed to economic discontent. 
Bill Clinton promised to "put people first" through job stimulus, universal health 
care and equitable trade agreements. The Democrats' stunning reversal in 1994 
had more to do with Clinton's failure to deliver on these promises than with social 
issues. <p>Consequently, some liberal Dem-ocratic strategists argue that Democrats 
should emphasize universal programs like prescription drugs, broader post-secondary 
education opportunities, job creation and infrastructure enhancement. And the 
party should inoculate itself against charges of social elitism by taking a tough 
stance against drugs and crime and in support of the conventional American family. 
If divisive social issues are neutralized, Democrats can once again become the 
majority party. <p>This approach may make tactical sense, but it will not build 
an enduring Democratic majority. If one is to be pro-family values, does this 
mean opposition to basic abortion rights, thus treating 50 percent of the population 
as second-class citizens? Does it include criminalizing alternative forms of sexuality 
and funding prisons for the 30 or 40 percent of our teenagers who experiment with 
marijuana? <p>A conventional conservative stance on these issues will inevitably 
alienate many of the voters Democrats need to become a majority party. What these 
Democrats are forgetting is that human beings are not simply economic machines. 
Even if they are guaranteed stable incomes, it matters equally to many that they 
be allowed to lead their personal lives in ways that express their deepest values. 
Ironically, <p>Marxists, business-oriented conservatives and some liberals share 
the conviction that man lives by bread alone. <p>The centrist Democratic Leadership 
Council is even worse. They combine social conservatism with an economic agenda 
that increas- ingly resembles old Republicanism. Through NAFTA, they are complicit 
in the destruction of many of the best manufacturing jobs and they have failed 
to deliver even on assistance for worker retraining. In celebrating huge reductions 
in the federal deficit as an end in itself, they betray those whom they purport 
to serve. <p>Nonetheless, even if Democrats had the courage to embrace progressive 
economics, they still must address social issues in a more forthright manner. 
Democrats should not pander to racist or sexist sentiments in order to gain white 
working-class votes. But that does not mean that the white working class does 
not have legitimate cultural gripes of its own. There is a sense in which liberal 
Democrats do practice a kind of social elitism. The best way to combat antipathy 
to social liberalism is not by reverting to an older social conservatism but by 
seeking to build a more self-critical and more genuinely expansive form of liberalism. 
<p>The cross-country skiing set can be overbearingly condescending toward snowmobilers. 
Worse than condescension, environmental regulation of such activities as Jet Skis 
and snowmobiles can reflect cultural bias far more than it does actual ecological 
damage. The million-dollar yachts that routinely discharge their sewage into our 
harbors are doing far more damage than many Jet Skis. "Family values" offers its 
own analogies. If affluent professional women deserve the right to an abortion, 
working-class opponents of abortion still need a party that will flight for free 
time and cultural space so that all families can sustain their own hobbies and 
family lives. Child care subsidies need to be as fair to stay-at-home parents 
as to the fast-tracking parents in search of quality day care. In educational 
matters, many of us find creationism absurd and repellent, but <p>I doubt that 
public education would collapse if parents had more opportunities to introduce 
such content, perhaps through charter schools. <p>At the very least, those liberals 
who believe in choice for sexual and racial minorities need to ask themselves 
repeatedly what they are doing to expand the range of personal choice for those 
who do not share their cultural norms. Expansion of such opportunities will create 
genuine and occasionally irresolvable dilemmas. But without a willingness more 
forthrightly and honestly to put these topics on the table, Dem- ocrats and the 
broader left will never carve out a new majority.
