<p>The economy is pumping; stocks are up; profits are up. George W. Bush stumps the country saying his tax cuts are working. On cue, the conservative chorus of pundits provide the echo, celebrating his triumph.</p>
<p>But before the president proclaims another premature "mission accomplished," a closer look at the situation on the ground is in order. It's not surprising the economy has started to grow. The Federal Reserve has held interest rates near record lows; the federal deficit is at a record high, driven by both soaring spending and sumptuous high-end tax cuts, and the dollar has plummeted more than 40 percent to the Euro, providing some help to U.S. exports. John Maynard Keynes was right: Government action can help lift an economy out of its doldrums.</p>
<p>But the good news in the corporate boardrooms hasn't yet reached the kitchen tables where Americans share their worries late at night -- about jobs and wages, health care, educating their kids, affording a decent retirement. Bush's CEO administration appears out of touch with that reality and his policies are part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>
<p>Jobs are still scarce and wages aren't keeping pace. Worse, workers continue to get laid off from good jobs, and find the new jobs available have lower wages and fewer benefits. Despite running up a record deficit, Bush will end his first term in office with the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Top-end tax cuts have proved to be -- as economists warned -- the least efficient way to get the economy going. A goodly portion of the money is being invested abroad, creating more jobs in Shanghai and Delhi than in Sandy Springs or DeKalb County.</p>
<p><b>Bleak signs everywhere</b></p>
<p>Bush's feckless trade policy, which has simply ignored the jobs being shipped abroad or how China games the system, doesn't help. And his refusal to repeal the tax breaks that reward companies that move jobs overseas makes things worse. The resulting Bush economy is perfectly reflected in the early reports on holiday shopping: luxury stores are doing well, discount houses OK, but the returns are bleak for stores that cater to middle-income families.</p>
<p>Health care costs are soaring, with strapped companies pushing more of the costs onto employees. Bush not only has ignored the soaring costs, but also the drug plan he just pushed through Congress, in a shameless payoff to the drug companies, actually prohibits Medicare from negotiating the best price for seniors. It will help fuel rising prices for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Classrooms are crowded, but teachers are being laid off. Tuitions are soaring, but government loans aren't keeping up. Crime is still with us, but police forces are being cut. The electricity blackouts symbolize the decline of basic infrastructure that families rely on.</p>
<p>But Bush insisted on top-end tax cuts to stimulate the economy, rather than putting people to work building schools, sewers, sustaining essential services -- investments that would have created far more good jobs at far less cost than the Bush tax cuts. When he fought against providing help to states and cities facing the worst fiscal crisis in 50 years, he guaranteed the cuts and local tax hikes that fell disproportionately on working families.</p>
<p><b>Retirements derailed</b></p>
<p>The retirement plans of many Americans were shattered in the stock market crash. That wasn't Bush's fault, but his policies don't help. In the wake of Enron, he pushed a pension bill that would make it easier for companies to provide pensions to the top floor while doing nothing for the shop floor.</p>
<p>And his tax cuts perversely provided less stimulus in the short term and more debt and deficits in the long term, a decade from now when Social Security and Medicare must take on the costs of the retiring baby boom generation. Bush now plans to push for private accounts in Social Security to mask deep cuts in guaranteed benefits.</p>
<p>In the short term, the problem isn't the Bush deficits -- as many Democrats and conservative Republicans suggest. The problem is what he did with the money.</p>
<p>It's as if your neighbor, faced with a faulty heater, doubled the mortgage, tapped out the retirement and college funds, and handed over the money to a Park Avenue firm that squandered much of it on investments abroad. The heater went back on, but the house foundation is crumbling, the roof leaks, the electricity doesn't work, he's in record debt and the money is gone. You wouldn't call that a success.</p>
<p>With the election year upon us, the administration is desperate to celebrate good economic news. But the recovery that is boosting the boardrooms hasn't yet reached America's kitchen tables. For working Americans, this is a mission far from accomplished.</p>
