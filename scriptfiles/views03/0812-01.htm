<p>Novelist George Orwell, who invented the concept of 'doublespeak,' must be spinning in his grave over the linguistic innovations that have accompanied the Bush administration's PR campaign for war in Iraq.

<p>The administration's spin doctors have coined a seemingly endless stream of catch phrases: "axis of evil," "coalition of the willing," and "shock and awe" to name just a few. The latest coinage, however, is a new term to describe the spin campaign itself: "big impact."

<p>Just as "shock and awe" was intended to stun the Iraqi military into submission, "big impact" is designed to have a similar effect on journalists and pundits. It sounds impressive, but its substance is simply an effort to deflect attention away from the administration's continuing failure to find any of the weapons of mass destruction that it claimed Saddam Hussein was stockpiling inside Iraq. The administration needs more time - six months, they're saying - before we should expect to see any proof of WMDs, the so-called 'big impact.'.

<p>It is unlikely that the administration will come up with anything as big and impactful as it is promising. The Bush team is simply hoping that six months will be enough time for public attention to wander elsewhere, while they adjust their rhetoric to lower expectations about whatever they eventually offer as 'proof.' Already they're talking about proving that Iraq had a 'weapons program' - as opposed to actual, physical weapons, which is what they were talking about in the months leading up to the war.


<p>In case anyone's memory is starting to fade on this point, here are some of their actual words:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>"<i>We know for a fact that there are weapons there.</i>&quot; - White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer, January 9, 2003 <br>
  </li>
    <li>"<i>We have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein recently authorized
Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons, the very weapons the dictator tells us he does not have.  Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.</i>&quot; - George W. Bush, February 8 and March 18, 2003 <br>
  </li>
    <li>&quot;<i>We are asked to accept Saddam decided to destroy those weapons. I say
that such a claim is palpably absurd.</i>&quot; - British Prime Minister Tony Blair, March 18, 2003 <br>
  </li>
    <li>&quot;<i>We know where they are. They are in the area around Tikrit and
Baghdad.</i>&quot; - Donald Rumsfeld, March 30, 2003 </li>
</ul>
<p>If Rumsfeld had been telling the truth, the weapons would have already been found by now. The fact is, they didn't 'know where they are', and as a result, 150,000 U.S. troops, with bulls-eyes all but painted on their backs, are trying to keep the lid on an increasingly restive population of 25 million Iraqis who clearly do not want us there.

<p>This war was sold to the American people on the basis of three major claims:
(1) Iraq had a formidable arsenal of WMDs; (2) Iraq was in cahoots with Al Qaeda; and (3) the Iraqi people would welcome U.S. troops as liberators. It should be clear to everyone by now that the first claim was drastically embellished and oversold. There is no evidence to support the second claim either, and the steady trickle of U.S. casualties in Iraq tells us that point number three was also wishful thinking. But if none of these arguments hold up under scrutiny, why are we still over there?

<p>Six months is a long time to wait for answers from the Bush administration. At current rates of attrition, that will mean several hundred more dead U.S. soldiers - a pretty 'big impact' all by itself.
