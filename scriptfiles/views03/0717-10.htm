<p> The special commission looking into the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks says it is facing roadblocks from the Justice Department and the Pentagon. 



<p> The chairman of the bipartisan National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States, former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, and the vice chairman, former Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton, complain that they are receiving some crucial documents their staff has asked the executive branch to turn over. 



<p> The intelligence agencies also are insisting that one of their representatives sit in on commission interviews with government officials, a presence that is bound to be intimidating. 



 

<p> Why is there a problem in getting to the bottom of this horrific attack against the nation? Could the attacks have been prevented? And where do we go from here? 



<p> The families of the more than 3,000 victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon -- and the nation -- are looking for closure. 



<p> Many have filed lawsuits against the airlines and are seeking documents from the government to back up their cases. 



<p> It is unusual for a commission to go public with criticism before it has completed its inquiry. But Kean and Hamilton obviously are frustrated in getting answers to their questions. 



<p> In its interim report, the commission gave the White House good marks for cooperation in turning over sensitive documents. 



<p> The Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were chided for slow starts, but were said to be making progress in disgorging classified papers. 



<p> But the commission said the super secret Justice Department and the Pentagon were dragging their feet. 



<p> That's no surprise, considering the way Attorney General John Ashcroft and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld control the flow of information in their fiefdoms. 



<p> The 9-11 commission said time is running out and that it may not meet the May 2004 deadline for its final report. The panel described its work as "the most wide-ranging outside investigation of American national security in the history of the United States." 



<p> The Bush administration, which had initially opposed the creation of the commission, is probably not too happy that its conclusions will be aired smack in the middle of the 2004 presidential election campaign. 



<p> The report is sure to spotlight some of the intelligence failings of both the Bush and the Clinton administrations. 



<p> Both administrations clearly fell down on the job in not fully comprehending the depth of the threat from Osama bin Laden. 



<p> The commission is expected to review, identify and evaluate lessons learned and make recommendations for the future. 



<p> Both Kean and Hamilton said they were pleased that they have been able to review reports of interrogations of suspected al-Qaida captives. 



<p> The United States is holding some 600 terrorist suspects under severely restrictive conditions at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and has been criticized for denying the prisoners access to their families and defense lawyers. 



<p> Mark Corallo, deputy director of public affairs at the Justice Department, said the department has cooperated with the investigation, passing on thousands of pages of highly classified national security information. But obviously not enough to win kudos from Kean and Hamilton. 



<p> The panel put the finger on the Pentagon for stonewalling on information relating to NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which is supposed to immediately put planes in the air when there is an aviation threat. 



<p> The panel also said the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other Defense Department divisions have been slow to respond to requests for information. 



<p> After the Pentagon gave reassurances that it would comply, the Commission seemed skeptical, adding in its report: "We look forward to seeing the results." 



<p> Commission investigators also are trying to coax the Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation Administration to give them more important information. 



<p> Cooperation of the Homeland Security Department was labeled "mixed." 



<p> The White House's lack of enthusiasm about a national independent commission probing its top-secret files led the administration to try to block early attempts at launching the inquiry. A joint congressional investigation is still trying to get a government green light to release the key documents it gathered during its hearings. 



<p> "We believe the president when he says he is committed to assisting the commission," the panel report said. 



<p> "The White House has demonstrated that commitment in some vital ways, but the next few weeks will be crucial." 



<p> All the president has to do is order the Justice Department and the Pentagon to fork over the documents. Let's see if he does.
