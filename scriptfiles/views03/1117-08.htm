<p>It is, almost literally, a Frankenstein monster on a very small scale. <p>Last 
week, a team of scientists in Maryland announced that they had taken bits and 
pieces of manufactured DNA that they had ordered from a scientific supply company 
and had combined that material in test tubes. The outcome was a living and entirely 
man-made virus, built from scratch and perfectly capable of reproducing itself. 
According to the Institute of Biological Energy Alternatives, the process took 
all of two weeks. <p>The team now intends to use that same technology to move 
up the scale of complexity and produce man-made bacteria. <p>Meanwhile, according 
to an online poll in Britain, the most-admired scientific invention of the last 
40 years is not the Internet or cellphones or the cloning of animals. It is the 
widget, a little device that makes canned beer taste like beer that is drawn fresh 
from the keg. <p>In one sense, the widget's popularity strikes an oddly reassuring 
note in this highly technological age. Yes, the world is being remade by science 
in ways that most of us can't begin to comprehend. But in the midst of that change, 
we haven't really changed our basic nature or our priorities. Man-made viruses 
may be far-out, but what we really want is fresher beer. <p>England, it seems, 
will always be England. <p>But that stubborn human nature is part of the problem, 
as well. <p>For instance, 30 seconds after we make some scientific breakthrough, 
we typically start thinking of ways to kill each other with it. That, too, is 
human nature. A century ago the Wright brothers achieved powered flight, and it 
didn't take long before aviators were dropping bricks, then bombs, then atomic 
bombs on their fellow human beings. <p>The widget, of course, is probably harmless. 
But the capacity to design and then create entirely new life-forms is not. Two 
years ago, a team of New York scientists succeeded in creating an entirely man-made, 
living version of the polio virus. With a little tinkering, it would probably 
be possible to create a form of that virus that renders polio vaccines useless 
-- a sobering thought in the current climate. <p>Likewise, human cultures across 
time and place have placed a high priority on male babies. We now have the power 
to gratify that wish too, and as the President's Council on Bioethics points out 
in a recent report, that power of gender selection is being used. "In several 
countries today, the ratio approaches or even exceeds 120 baby boys for every 
100 baby girls," the report states. <p>Human beings have also long sought eternal 
life, first through religion and increasingly through science. Certainly much 
longer life spans, if not actual immortality, may soon be within human reach. 
But before altering the human life cycle, the bioethics council asks, "Is there 
a goodness and meaning in life so fundamental that it is too wide to be grasped 
by our scientific vision?" <p>The truth is, we don't know; we cannot know. In 
fact, our scientific knowledge already exceeds our ability to use it wisely. The 
sad case of Terri Schiavo, the Florida stroke victim kept technically alive by 
science for 13 years, illustrates all too tragically the limitations of ancient 
rules when applied to modern circumstances. Yes, life is sacred. But death must 
be sacred too. <p>For 500 years now, we have turned to science to answer our hardest 
questions. Now it is science that asks the questions, profound questions that 
go to the heart of the human experience. For the most part, though, we have refused 
to answer. <p>According to a 2001 poll by the National Science Foundation, barely 
half of Americans know that "the earliest humans did not live at the same time 
as dinosaurs." Barely half accepted the scientific consensus that human beings 
developed from earlier species. And in 2001, fewer Americans felt well-informed 
about science, medicine and technology than they did just four years earlier. 
<p>So today we know more, far more, than we can possibly comprehend. And as complexity 
grows and demands that we make decisions, we retreat further into simplicity. 
<p>We may find comfort there, but I doubt we'll find the answers we need. <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy;
