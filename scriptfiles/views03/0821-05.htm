<p>Remember the slogan "ending welfare as we knew it"? Well, happy seventh anniversary! Tomorrow marks the anniversary of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, otherwise known as welfare reform.

<p>Sounds good, right? Responsibility and work opportunities are essential to alleviating poverty. Unfortunately, alleviating poverty was not the true intent. Since the inception of welfare reform, the income gap in the United States has widened at an unprecedented rate and the labor market is severely threatened.

<p>Nearly one of every five children lives in poverty. People who have nowhere else to turn are being denied access to critical resources. The substandard level of welfare benefits forces us to constantly compromise our most basic needs. This is what we are "celebrating" when we speak of welfare reform. Sure enough, it ended welfare as we knew it but we "welfare queens" would like to show you what it created. 

<p>Welcome to the life of former and current welfare recipients. We are no particular type of people but we do share a collective experience, one in which we are the recipients of political hostility. When you hear the words personal responsibility, imagine a world of punitive policies and regulated behavior.

<p>Imagine being deemed irresponsible because you lack a support system or sufficient resources. Imagine a world where the choices you make regarding marriage, children, fleeing domestic abuse, placing an infant in childcare, obtaining quality care for your children or obtaining the education or skills to earn a livable wage are all dictated by punitive policies. Now imagine that your voice is never heard when it comes to creating these policies. Imagine constant threats of being sanctioned (a reduction or termination of benefits) governing decisions such as choosing between taking your child to the doctor and showing up for "job search." In the background a five-year clock is ticking away. 

<p>Low-income households can receive benefits for a maximum of five years. This is plenty of time for some but it's highly unrealistic for many others. Despite the federal time limit, thousands of families in Washington exceeded their limit. This left the state with a moral and financial dilemma. We're thankful that our state recognizes the fact that many families have legitimate reasons for requiring assistance beyond an arbitrary time period. Many families have been in full compliance with welfare's work requirements yet still don't earn enough to survive. 

<p>So, when you hear the words "work opportunity," try not to laugh (or cry). We are forced to look for work, even when there are significant barriers to employment -- even when there is no work to be found. Imagine single parents required to work full-time without quality childcare or having to fight with caseworkers to obtain a GED or trade certificate. Imagine higher education being ruled out as an option or being forced to take the first job offered, even if it will not support your family. It is inconsequential if the job is during evening hours and you cannot find appropriate childcare. If you "fail" in job search (you do not get a job within 90 days), you are discouraged from furthering your skills and encouraged to lower your standards. Never mind if you have an infant. Now is the time to go to work. No skills or job history? Good luck. 

<p>President Bush would like to see more of us -- regardless of circumstance or work history -- looking for jobs. Provisions for educational opportunities are difficult under current law. The administration's proposals make them null and void. As our state's unemployment rate hovers around 7 percent, we simultaneously have a shortage of skilled workers in many fields. As the labor market becomes overly saturated with workers, many employers have the opportunity of lowering wages and benefits packages and busting unions. In 1996 we raised caution, fearing that if more low-wage workers entered the labor market, wages for everyone could drop. That didn't happen during the economic boom of the '90s, but it is happening now. 


<p>It is foolish to believe that, in general, people actually choose to be poor. The truth is the majority of welfare recipients are either employed in low wage/dead-end jobs or are in a mandatory job-search activity. Sometimes we are required to do both in order to achieve a full-time work requirement.

<p>We simply become like the thousands of other low-wage working parents with few options and little hope. We are being set up to fail. Then we are punished for "failing." We "welfare queens" ask you to consider the social costs of current welfare policies as they relate to the future of our society. This is one thing that all of our children share.
