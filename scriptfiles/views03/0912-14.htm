      THE MAN IN BLACK<br>
      US country singer Johnny Cash, who has died at the age of 71 in a hospital in Nashville. Cash never missed an opportunity to speak out against injustice and wrongdoing, whether it be racism, the Vietnam War or the poor treatment of retarded children. (AFP/DPA/File) <br>
