<p>How bad can things get, how fast? Are we already at the point where

literally nothing can derail the war machine? That's exactly what some

powerful media outlets seem to have decided, with predictable effects on

public opinion and policy. In its March 3 issue, <i><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0226-01.htm">Newsweek</a></i><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0226-01.htm"> disclosed</a> that the Bush Administration had deliberately suppressed

information exculpating Iraq--information from the same reliable source

previously cited by the Administration as confirming that Iraq had

developed weapons of mass destruction since the 1991 Gulf War. As

damning as this disclosure was, <i>Newsweek</i> chose to underplay it,

perhaps out of a belief that the Bush Administration's Big Lie

techniques have become so pervasive that another instance of tendentious

truth-twisting is no longer front-page news.</p>

<p>



Here's the background: In the summer of 1995 Saddam's then-son-in-law,

Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel, former minister of Iraq's military industry

and the person in charge of its nuclear/chemical/biological programs, defected and provided what was deemed scrupulously

accurate, detailed accounts of those weapons. Kamel's information has

been cited as central evidence and a key reason for attacking Iraq. In

his February 5 presentation to the UN Security Council, Secretary of

State Colin Powell said: "It took years for Iraq to finally admit that

it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent VX. A single drop of

VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission only came

out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the

defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law."</p>

<p>



But <i>Newsweek</i>'s John Barry revealed that the Administration had

excised a central component of Kamel's testimony--that he had personal

knowledge that Iraq had "destroyed all its chemical and biological

weapons stocks and the missiles to deliver them." To be sure, Kamel

said, Iraq had not abandoned its WMD ambitions, had retained the design

and engineering details, and was likely to return to production given an

opportunity. But his last information was that Iraq's VX arsenal no

longer existed.</p>

<p>



According to the story, UN inspectors had reasons to hush up this

revelation, as they were trying to bluff Saddam into revealing more. But

what is Powell's excuse for using only half of Kamel's claim? And why

did <i>Newsweek</i> and the rest of the American media make so little of

this major story?</p>

<p>



<i>Newsweek</i> chose to run a short, 500-word item in its "Periscope"

section rather than put the story on the cover or make it the focal

point of a longer article showing that the Bush Administration is

rushing to war for no reason at all.</p>

<p>



I was curious why <i>Newsweek</i> did not think this warranted a more

muscular presentation. Communications director Ken Weine argued that the

mag breaks many of its best stories in short sections like "Periscope,"

citing as an example a brief piece two years ago showing that Sony had

fabricated print movie reviews, a piece, he noted, that garnered

worldwide attention.</p>

<p>



But fake movie reviews flacking dubious entertainment and fake missile

reviews flacking a war in which thousands may die are two different

things entirely, and it is a sad comment on the media that such

comparisons would even be made.</p>

<p>



<i>Newsweek</i>, and Barry in particular, deserve kudos for bringing

this important item to the public's attention at all. But if

<i>Newsweek</i>'s editors had the guts to put something like this on the

cover, with the kind of dramatic headline they use for lesser subjects,

they could really affect the debate. Instead, that issue of

<i>Newsweek</i> featured a cover story on the African-American gender

gap in jobs, education and other areas--a worthy story, but nothing that

could not have waited a week.</p>

<p>



For what it's worth, one insider explained that <i>Newsweek</i> has

changed and no longer tries to shake the earth on major issues of the

day, preferring to tweak the zeitgeist on softer things or muse

elegantly about the "big picture" behind the details.</p>

<p>



Perhaps it's not surprising that other media failed to pick up on the

Kamel story: The big papers and magazines hate to acknowledge they've

been scooped by competitors. Of course, you might think they'd want to

outdo <i>Newsweek</i> with some hard-hitting inquiries of their own.

You'd be wrong. It's not that the American media have ignored

Iraq--obviously, it's been a near-obsession. But in the absence of

intrepid investigative reporting and editorial courage, they smothered

the audience in inconsequential material about the most consequential of

topics.</p>

<p>



The Hussein Kamel revelation is probably the biggest Iraq story to get

punted, but it isn't the only significant example. It's worth noting

that British revelations that the National Security Agency spied on

diplomats representing UN Security Council members during the Iraq

deliberations got a small mention in the <i>Washington Post</i> and

prompted no questions at Bush's press conference. Another revelation,

that a British government employee was arrested for allegedly leaking

this information, which Daniel Ellsberg says is more timely and

potentially more important than his own Pentagon Papers in informing the

public, again got little notice in this country. And the unprecedented

resignations of two career US diplomats over Iraq policy hasn't

generated any noteworthy examinations of how people inside the

government really feel about the race to hostilities.</p>

<p>



Cumulatively, Barry's item on Kamel, the revelation that Colin Powell

was citing a graduate student's thesis as British "intelligence" and a

new revelation that more British "evidence" of Iraqi nuclear arms

development cited by the Administration was (according to weapons

inspectors themselves) fabricated suggest that a monstrous Big Lie is in

process--an effort to construct falsified evidence and to trick this

country and the world.</p>

<p>



How's that for zeitgeist material, <i>Newsweek</i>? </p>
