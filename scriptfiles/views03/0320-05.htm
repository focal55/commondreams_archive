<p>Last night, our president announced a war to the nation and the world. Let 

us be clear about what this war is and what it is not.



<p>This war is not the result of a failure of diplomacy.



<p>This war is not a pre-emptive war.



<p>This war is not about weapons of mass destruction.



<p>This war is not about terrorism.



<p>This war is not about the liberation of the Iraqi people.



<p>Diplomacy: Nations typically engage in diplomacy to avoid having to go to 

war. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, numerous attempts at diplomacy were 

made by France, the Soviet Union, and the Arab League. They all foundered, 

primarily on the intransigence of the first Bush administration. In this 

case, the second Bush administration tried to use "diplomacy" to create a 

war out of whole cloth, making no attempt to negotiate with Iraq. In fact, 

as Iraq made concession after concession -- as it became increasingly clear 

that whatever pitiful arsenal Iraq had could be found and dismantled if 

inspections were allowed to continue -- U.S. attempts to strong-arm other 

countries into supporting the war became increasingly crude and coercive. 

Although those attempts mostly failed, they were hardly aimed at preventing 

the war.



<p>Pre-emption: In order to pre-empt a threat with war, there must be some 

credible reason to believe that the threat exists and that no other 

strategies will address it. A threat involves capability and intent. In 

this case, the Bush administration was not able to show that Iraq has the 

capability, and no attempt was made to show that it had the intent to attack.



<p>Weapons of Mass Destruction: As time passed, the administration's lies, 

half-truths, and distortions became increasingly ridiculous. From scare 

stories about an "unmanned aerial vehicle" that turned out to be a glider 

held together with spit and baling wire, to forged documents claiming that 

Iraq was trying to buy uranium from Niger, nothing has held water. Claims 

of mobile biological laboratories were refuted by weapons inspectors, as 

were claims that Iraq had or was about to get nuclear weapons. And, of 

course, ongoing inspections would have ensured that no arsenal could be built.



<p>Terrorism: This claim is even more absurd. The best the Bush administration 

could come up with was a Jordanian militant, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a member 

of Ansar al-Islam whose ties to either al-Qaeda or the Iraqi government are 

completely unsubstantiated. A recent British intelligence assessment 

concluded that there is no link between Iraq and al-Qaeda.

<p>Liberation: The United States does not care about true democracy for Iraq. 

In 1991, when a popular uprising after the Gulf War threatened to oust 

Hussein's government, the United States intervened to keep Hussein in 

power. The reason, as officials explained later, was that the United States 

wanted a military coup to preserve what Richard Haas of the National 

Security Council called "Saddam's regime without Saddam." Since 9/11, the 

Bush administration has funded a coup attempt in Venezuela, installed a 

puppet regime in Afghanistan, and cracked down on basic democratic 

protections in the United States. It would be ironic if the administration 

wanted democracy for Iraqis but not for Americans. U.S. plans for Iraq 

clearly involve establishing yet another puppet regime



<p>So, what is this war? It is an act of premeditated aggression. It is part 

of an attempt to put the tremendous energy reserves of the Middle East more 

tightly under American control. It is the key stage in the building of a 

new empire. It is part of a long-term attempt to establish more clearly 

than ever the rule of force in international affairs and sweep away any 

role for international law or institutions beyond those in service to the 

empire.



<p>Another fact we must remember: This war did not begin last night.



<p>March 19, 2003, was simply the start of a new, more intense phase of the 

U.S. attack on Iraq that has been going on since the end of the 1991 Gulf 

War, through the harshest economic embargo in modern history and through 

more than four years of regular bombing.



<p>Already, hundreds of thousands -- possibly more than a million  -- innocent 

Iraqis have died in this ongoing assault. As we count the civilian 

casualities from this newest phase, they must be added to this roster of 

the dead so that the costs of the U.S. war will not be obscured.



<p>This is crucial to understand, because when U.S. military forces topple the 

government of Saddam Hussein, we shouldn't be surprised if ordinary Iraqis 

cheer. Their celebrations will not be about only the demise of a dictator 

but about the hoped-for end of a regime of fear and deprivation imposed by 

the United States, in which parents have been forced to watch children die 

of malnutrition and disease caused by the enforced poverty created by the 

embargo.

<p>And, finally: Just as the war against Iraq did not begin last night, the 

larger war for empire will not end with Iraq. Other nations, notably Iran, 

are already on the target list. Bush administration officials talk of 

remaking the map of the Middle East. Beyond that is the desire to counter 

the rising power of China.



<p>The American takeover of Iraq likely cannot be stopped. But just as there 

has been a time for war, there can come a time for justice if we -- the 

citizens of the empire -- recognize  that this battle may be lost, but 

there is still a world to win.
