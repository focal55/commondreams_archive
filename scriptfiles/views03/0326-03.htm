<p>I write with a heavy heart.  Our cause has shifted from trying to prevent a 

needless war to seeking to end an illegal war.  The audacity of the Bush 

administration takes one's breath away.



<p>The United States is bombing Baghdad, engaged in its "shock and awe" 

strategy.  Shock yes, but there is no awe.  To suggest awe reflects only 

the arrogance of the Bush militarists.  US attacks on Iraq are shocking and 

awful.



<p>Shocking that we are at war in violation of international law and our 

Constitution.



<p>Shocking that our government is committing aggressive warfare, which is a 

crime.



<p>Shocking that a large majority of the US Congress has been so compliant and 

cowardly, handing over their responsibility to declare war to the 

president.  By giving up their Constitutional powers, Congress is putting 

the future of our Republic in jeopardy.



<p>Shocking that Bush has demonstrated contempt for the strongly held 

positions of our allies, and hundreds of millions of their protesting 

citizens throughout the world.



<p>Shocking that Bush has shown such studied indifference to the millions of 

Americans who have taken to the streets in protest of his war plans.



<p>Shocking that the United States has attacked Iraq in defiance of the United 

Nations Security Council and with disregard for US obligations under the 

Charter of the United Nations.



<p>Shocking that the United States has acted in bad faith, having assured the 

other members of the Security Council at the time of passage of Resolution 

1441 that it does not provide for an automatic recourse to war.  John 

Negroponte, the US Ambassador to the United Nations, assured other members 

of the Security Council on the day that Resolution 1441 was passed: 

"Whatever violation there is, or is judged to exist, will be dealt with in 

the Council, and the Council will have an opportunity to consider the 

matter before any other action is taken."  What he apparently meant was 

that the Security Council would have a chance to endorse a US-led war 

against Iraq or be cast aside as irrelevant.



<p>Now we are faced with the challenge of ending this illegal war, and 

bringing those who are committing war crimes to justice.  This must not be 

only victors' justice, but justice that applies to all sides.  As Bush and 

Rumsfeld have emphasized, following superior orders will not be a defense 

to the commission of war crimes.  This should be so both for the Iraqi 

leadership and for the American leadership.



<p>The anger wells up at the hypocrisy and arrogance of the Bush 

administration.  The two most powerful statements that I have seen recently 

in opposition to the war are Senator Byrd's lamentation, "Today, I weep for 

my country." and the expression of bitterness of Michael Waters-Bey, the 

bereft father of one of the US soldiers to die in a helicopter crash 

returning to Kuwait from a mission in Iraq.  Mr. Waters-Bey said that he 

wanted to tell the president that "this was not your son or daughter.  That 

chair he sat in at Thanksgiving will be empty forever."



<p>There will be more killing and more deaths, more empty chairs.  It is a 

time of sadness, as our country is losing its credibility and honor 

throughout the world.  It is a time of tragedy that the militarists are 

having their day.  It is a time of shock, but far from a time of awe.  We 

will find a way back to decency, democracy and the rule of law.  Until 

then, we must continue to express our dissent and opposition to this war, 

to policies of perpetual war, and to the diminishment of our democratic 

rights.  We must also find a way to hold the guilty accountable for their 

crimes against peace and war crimes.
