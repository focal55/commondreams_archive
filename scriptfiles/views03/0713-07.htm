<p>Is it too early to ask if George W. Bush could become a one-term president? <P></P>His entire presidency has been geared to avoiding the fate of his father. Yet, suddenly, nothing is going right for him.<P></P>Not in Iraq. Not at home, and not just on the economy: the highest unemployment rate in nine years, with 236,000 jobs already lost this year; another 1 million Americans losing medical coverage, to join the similarly deprived 44 million; the deficit heading to a record $400 billion (all figures U.S.) because of unconscionable tax cuts for the rich and a ballooning budget for the Pentagon; and cash-starved states slashing school programs and, heresy in America, laying off cops and releasing prisoners.<P></P>The bad news, brewing for months, had been lost in the war on terrorism, which morphed into the war on Iraq. But a firestorm is breaking out even on that previously sacrosanct front.<P></P> Almost every aspect of the war is being questioned. At stake is nothing less than the integrity of the administration on a fundamental issue:<b> </b>the president waging war under false pretenses. <P></P>That's what finished Lyndon Johnson, post-Gulf of Tonkin, along with rising American casualties in Vietnam.<P></P>The Bush administration is responding with finger-pointing, the first sign of a crack in a tightly run ship. It is scapegoating CIA director George Tenet over the false claim that Iraq had acquired uranium from Niger.<P></P>Pent-up questions are popping up everywhere about the twisting of intelligence to exaggerate the Iraqi threat; the mining of post-Sept. 11 fears to suggest that Saddam Hussein or his agents could attack America; the understating of the costs of the war (now pegged at $3.9 billion a month since January); the overstating of the revenue potential of Iraqi oil; the stonewalling toward the commission probing 9/11; and the suspension of civil liberties and other democratic traditions.<P></P>The president's cockiness is evaporating. His "bring 'em on" taunt to the Iraqis — deemed "unworthy of his office" by Democratic Senator John Kerry, and "phony and macho" by House minority leader Dick Gephardt — has given way to evasiveness over the tall tale of Niger.<P></P>Vice-president Dick Cheney is refusing to say what he knew and when.<P></P> 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is claiming he learned of the fraud only "in recent days." 
<P></P>Democratic presidential hopefuls are taking the gloves off. Howard Dean, the most critical of Bush, is finding the greatest resonance in the public.<P></P>Bush may ride all this out, using the powers of incumbency and his planned $200 million campaign war chest. Or by finding another foreign diversion. <P></P>But consider the big picture.<P></P>The story of Niger, itself bigger than assumed, is just a start.<P></P>The CIA, under pressure from Cheney's office, secretly sent a respected retired diplomat to Africa to check out the Iraqi link. <P></P>Joseph Wilson, who was George H.W. Bush's envoy to Iraq when Saddam invaded Kuwait, reported back as early as last year that the claim was false.<P></P>Yet the president cited it in his State of the Union address in January. The issue bubbled up now because Wilson spilled the beans last weekend. <P></P>With the controversy overshadowing Bush's African tour, the White House got Tenet to take responsibility.<P></P>The administration also has been shifting ground on weapons of mass destruction.<P></P>Bush and Rumsfeld — and Tony Blair, of course — have taken to saying that everyone knew Saddam had such a program.<P></P>But that was never the issue. Rather, that he had the capacity and the will to attack, "within 45 minutes," as Blair put it.<P></P>Rumsfeld, usually confidently extemporaneous, has taken to reading from a lawyerly text: We went to war not because of new evidence about Saddam's proscribed weapons but because "we saw the evidence in a dramatic new light." Disingenuous.<P></P>The other major Anglo-American claim, that Saddam was training Al Qaeda operatives in "chemical weapons activities," has not been proven and has, in fact, recently been shot down by the United Nations anti-terrorism committee. <P></P><b></b>In Iraq, a few things are becoming crystal clear: Bush's America wages wars well but cannot build peace; triggers the exact opposite political fallout of what it predicts; and fails to evoke the love it believes awaits its advancing armies.<P></P>
The conquest of Iraq was touted as a harbinger of American-style democracy in the region. But Islamists have just swept the election in, of all places, neighboring Kuwait, wiping out pro-West liberals as well as women's hopes of winning the right to vote.
<P></P>
The anti-Americanism isn't surprising. Following the American win in Afghanistan, Islamists won the election in neighboring Pakistan, even ruling the province along the Afghan border where they are imposing Taliban-like strictures. 
<P></P>
That's not the only parallel. No Osama bin Laden, no Saddam either. A $25 million bounty for one and a $25 million bounty for the other, plus $15 million for sons Uday and Qusay.
<P></P>The America that can guide missiles and bombs across the oceans cannot manage, in 10 weeks, to get electricity and water running, leaving Iraqis stewing in the 50-degree heat. Essential services are said to be in worse shape than during Saddam's rule. Ditto law and order.<P></P>The America that uses satellite-run global positioning systems to guide its troops across the globe cannot get a two-bit TV station going in Baghdad to communicate with the locals, who are tuning in Iranian TV beamed from across the border.<P></P>The America that expected flowers for its troops from a liberated nation now confronts the reality of losing one soldier a day in the "shooting gallery" that is Iraq, as Ted Kennedy said at a Senate hearing.<P></P>The America that defied the United Nations and world opinion to swagger unilaterally into war, deploying a staggering 244,000 troops, is calling on "something like 70, 80 or 90 countries," as Rumsfeld put it, to relieve the tired and angry 140,000 remaining U.S. soldiers who want to go home.<P></P>Those propositioned include Honduras, Poland, Pakistan, India and Ukraine. But not, as several senators have suggested, France or Germany or Turkey. Presumably because they refused to joined the war. The Bush boys are a sulking lot.<P></P>Rumsfeld said that if France or Germany — he did not mention Turkey — want to help, they can do so through NATO, which he is asking for help. <P></P>No, thanks, said French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin. France would join an international peacekeeping force only if it is authorized by the United Nations. <P></P>The situation in Iraq will no doubt improve in the months ahead. Whether it does in America in time for Bush II remains to be seen.<P><i>Haroon Siddiqui is the Star's editorial page editor emeritus.</i></p>
