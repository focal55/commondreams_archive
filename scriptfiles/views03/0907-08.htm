<p>The federal government is by far the largest consumer in the land- 
hundreds of billions of dollars yearly. It buys many of the products 
regular consumers purchase, including motor vehicles, fuel, drugs, 
paper, clothing, food, computers, software, appliances, furnishings, and 
medical devices. It also buys less usual products such as construction 
equipment, buildings, highways and military hardware.
<p>Connecting all these purchases with established national missions, 
rooted in law, to clean up the environment, promote consumer health and 
safety, advance job safety and save taxpayer dollars can itself become a 
remarkable national mission. If the agencies and departments which do 
this buying could receive support and direction from Congress and the 
President, Americans would start seeing their dollars go further and 
their well-being improve.
<p>This is not altogether a new story, but it is a largely forgotten one. 
How many people know that it was the U.S. Army which decades ago started 
legitimizing much cheaper generic drugs by using them in its hospitals? 
Until then, the big drug companies peddled the myth that much more 
expensive brand name drugs were purer and safer.
<p>Equally little known is that the opposition of the auto companies to air 
bags was significantly broken by the General Services Administration 
putting out a bid in the mid-Eighties for 5500 air bag-equipped cars for 
government employees. GM and Chrysler refused to bid; Ford did and the 
rest is history. Back in the Civil War days, standardized clothing sizes 
were introduced when Lincoln's Union forces had to purchase uniforms for 
its troops.
<p>Here is the wonderful prospect. Government purchasing specifications 
pushing forward the frontiers of innovation or available technologies 
that favor health, safety and environmental protection can quickly 
create large markets. This in turn offers producers or vendors early 
economies of scale, lower unit costs and lower risks. This then makes it 
possible for companies to invest in innovations before a consumer market 
exists. The results are products that become available to a wider 
public, just like generic drugs and air bags.
<p>Nearly thirty years ago, Professor Barry Commoner, the great 
environmental scientist, proposed to the Pentagon that it buy solar 
photovoltaics at a scale which would drop unit costs and create a 
growing solar industry. His proposal was not accepted. But in the 
nineties, on a smaller scale, the Navy was placing a projected 20,000 
photovoltaics in remote installations for economic reasons. There is no 
need to refuel and it is good for the environment. The Pentagon did its 
best not to publicize this good deed.
<p>Of course long-time vendors to governmental agencies often oppose these 
innovations which challenge the "not invented here" syndrome. And the 
more the federal government leases or outsources its activities to 
corporations, the less realizable is this potential of government buying 
for important innovations.
<p>There is another reason why government purchasing is now so important to 
advance statutorily based national missions of health, safety, 
environment, efficiency and care for posterity. Federal regulation is 
disappearing.
<p>Why, you say, are there all those outcries by companies, trade 
associations and think tanks about over-regulation. A skeptic would say- 
how else do these groups keep raising so much money from their members 
or benefactors? The skeptic is right. Most federal regulations on the 
books are years, if not decades, obsolete and long since surpassed by 
industrial practice. They are not upgraded. Other categories of 
regulations are: (1) those demanded by the industries themselves, such 
as agricultural marketing orders, (2)newer regulations watered down to 
levels acceptable to companies that brag about their meeting or 
exceeding federal regulations (like meat inspection standards) and (3) 
those which are completely written into law by corporate attorneys (like 
gas pipeline standards and railroad safety rules).
<p>In the financial or commercial areas the anemic nature of the rules are 
legendary. What's left are regulations that are often violated but 
rarely prosecuted (like water pollution violations)?
<p>So federal regulation as a force for pushing industries faster to become 
safer or better in various ways (as the first wave of federal motor 
vehicle safety standards did) is largely a myth. This leaves the massive 
consumer purchases of the federal government to meet these lawful 
purposes, as is now being done in modest ways for the buying of 
post-consumer content copying paper.
<p>Under the rubric of consumer sovereignty and the "customer is always 
right", do not underestimate the corporate opposition forces. They know 
how consequential smart buying can be. Just ask Microsoft, whose 
monopoly power has pushed out competitors which can provide the federal 
government with software that is more affordable, usable, secure and 
innovative.
<p>So, Uncle Sam as smart consumer and shopper needs to become a widely 
discussed agenda among citizen and taxpayer groups and their political 
representatives in Congress and at the state legislatures. For more
