<p>We are advocates of public financing for all candidates for
federal office  --  to Congress as well as the presidency  --  but we
think Howard Dean made the right choice when he decided to skip
federal matching funds for his primary campaign. George W. Bush plans
to spend upwards of $200 million trashing the Democrats until the
Republican convention in September. Democrats who take the $18.7
million in taxpayer money in the primaries are limited to $45 million
in overall spending. That likely would leave the Democratic nominee a
sitting duck for Bush and Co.'s attack ads next summer.</P>

<P> So Dean consulted with his half-million online supporters, and
the 105,000 who responded overwhelmingly agreed to bankroll the
primary fight to oust Bush. Dean will need a lot of $100
contributions to keep pace with the $2,000 contributions Bush's
fundraisers are scooping up at country clubs and executive suites at
a dizzying pace.</P>

<P> The most important point is that Dean has a commendable campaign
finance reform plan (see <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com" target="_new">www.deanforamerica.com</a>) that includes: 1) A
proposal to fix the presidential public funding system (through,
among other things, a higher public-to-private match for the first
$100 of every individual contribution, higher primary spending limits
and expanding to to House and Senate candidates; 2) a plan similar to
the "Our Democracy, Our Airwaves" bill introduced by Sens. John
McCain, Russ Feingold and Dick Durbin that would enforce public
interest broadcast obligations and create a voucher system for free
air time for candidates, funded by a spectrum use fee; 3) a proposal
to replace the perennially deadlocked six-member Federal Election
Commission with a new three-member commission and administrative law
judges; 4) a pledge to nominate tough-minded, pro-reform FEC
commissioners; and 5) a tax credit on contributions to federal
candidates up to $100.</P>

<P> Dean also embraces a proposal to limit the states' power to
redistrict to once a decade. He encourages the Iowa model of
redistricting by independent bodies, rather than partisan state
legislatures. He would renew the Voting Rights Act when it comes up
for reauthorization in 2007. He would appoint a commission to explore
ideas such as instant runoff voting, Internet voting, nonpartisan
primaries, an election day holiday and abolition of the Electoral
College. And he endorses US Rep. Rush Holt's bill (HR 2239, the Voter
Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2003) to require that
all electronic voting machines produce an actual paper record so
voters can check the accuracy of their votes and give election judges
a paper trail to audit. </P>

<P> On that point Dean agrees the Democratic National Committee,
which went on record Oct. 4 demanding that all electronic voting
equipment used in public elections incorporate a voter-verified paper
audit trail "as soon as practical, but in no case any later than the
November 2004 general election." Although the mainstream media has
been dismissing concerns about e-voting accountability, numerous
glitches were exposed in November 2002 and more were reported after
the Nov. 4 election, where paper trails would have come in handy.
</P>

<P> The leading manufacturer of e-voting machines, Diebold Inc., has
responded to concerns about voting security problems by pursuing
court orders to shut down websites that publish company documents
leaked by a hacker. Free speech advocates, led by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation and Stanford University's Cyberlaw Clinic, on
Nov. 4 sued Diebold, demanding it stop the harassment. Voting
activists who have received the cease-and-desist orders, including
students from at least 20 universities, claim the documents raise
serious security concerns about Diebold, which has more than 50,000
touchscreen voting terminals nationwide but keeps its software
secret.</P>

<P> According to the Associated Press, a Diebold spokesman said in
late October that the internal documents aren't necessarily authentic
 --  but that hasn't stopped the company from claiming they are
copyrighted.</P>

<P> On Nov. 3, a California advisory panel refused to certify new
Diebold voting machines planned for use in at least three California
counties in 2004, saying it plans to investigate uncertified software
and hardware that may have been used. </P>

<P> Dozens of Silicon Valley computer scientists have been arguing
for more than a year that Diebold's voting equipment is prone to
hackers or computer malfunction and it should provide voters with a
printed receipt for verification. "Without a voter-verifiable paper
trail, the public is wholly dependent on the certification procedures
to safeguard the election process," Kim Alexander told the Associated
Press.</P>

<P> Wired.com, which has reported extensively on e-voting
controversy, noted that Australians designed a system two years ago
that addressed and eased most of the concerns expressed by US
critics: The important distinction is that the Australians chose to
make the software running their system completely open to public
scrutiny.</P>

<P> A private Australian company designed the system, but it was
based on specifications set by independent election officials, who
posted the code on the Internet for all to see and evaluate. The
software was produced in six months and it went through a trial run
in a state election in 2001. A comparative manual count after the
election showed that the system operated accurately. Critics say the
development process is a model for how electronic voting machines
should be made in the US.</P>

<P> Phillip Green, electoral commissioner for the Capital Territory,
which includes Canberra, said the commission rejected a printout
feature to keep expenses down. However, Matt Quinn, the lead engineer
on the product, thinks all e-voting systems should offer a receipt.
"There's no reason voters should trust a system that doesn't have it,
and they shouldn't be asked to," he told Wired.com. "Why on earth
should (voters) have to trust me  --  someone with a vested interest
in the project's success?" he said. "A voter-verified audit trail is
the only way to 'prove' the system's integrity to the vast majority
of electors, who after all, own the democracy." </P>

<P> That might be too much to expect in the US, where counting votes
is Diebold's business. Democrat Holt's bill has not yet received a
hearing in the GOP-dominated House.</i>
