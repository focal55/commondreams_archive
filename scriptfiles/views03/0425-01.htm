<p>JUST WHEN Democrats were feeling stymied by the (short-term) triumph of the Bush Iraq strategy, some self-inflicted wounds have been opened in the coalition. Each, in its own way, reflects the hubris of the far right that dominates this administration. If Bush II goes the way of Bush I, he will have been done in by the excesses of his own camp. 


<p>On the war front, Colin Powell has been playing the role of benign diplomat, putting a reasonable face on a policy that he abhors. But this isn't enough for the ultras. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and company evidently want total victory, over the State Department as well as Saddam.

<p>Rumsfeld, a close ally of the disgraced Newt Gingrich (who serves at Rumsfeld's pleasure on the Defense Policy Board) unleashed the former speaker to give a startlingly undiplomatic anti-Powell diatribe at the American Enterprise Institute, the citadel neo-conservative ideology.

<p>Gingrich attacked Powell's efforts to enlist Syria's diplomatic cooperation as ''ludicrous,'' even though they have the explicit approval of the president and Condi Rice, the national security adviser. He characterized Powell's State Department as a ''broken instrument of diplomacy.''

<p>Insiders say it is inconceivable that Gingrich could have given such a speech without Rumsfeld's knowledge if not his active connivance. The White House, through press spokesman Ari Fleisher, responded with faint praise, terming Powell an ''able, able diplomat.''

<p>Powell is in an awkward spot. Thus far, he has been determined to stay, to rise above the attacks and continue the infighting, using his influence to make a dangerous foreign policy slightly less awful.

<p>Though the neo-cons may not appreciate him, Powell has been immensely useful to them. By pressing the administration to go initially through the UN, Powell gave Prime Minister Tony Blair the necessary fig leaf for British participation in the war. The ''coalition'' with the Brits in turn made the US seem less unilateralist when Bush simply ignored the UN and invaded Iraq. Powell has also limited the diplomatic damage done by the Pentagon's bullying.

<p>It would serve Rumsfeld and company right if they succeeded in forcing Powell out, which would further reveal the administration's plain radicalism.

<p>On the domestic front, Bush and his far-right allies are making a similar blunder, alienating the fiscally responsible wing of the GOP with an aggressive campaign for more tax cuts for the very rich. The tax-cut lobby, reportedly with White House blessing, has been vilifying moderate GOP senators who drew the line at a still excessive cut of $350 billion. The lobby, which in typical Orwellian fashion calls itself the Club for Growth, is also threatening primary challenges to moderate House Republicans who voted against the full tax cuts.

<p>Doesn't anyone remember Jim Jeffords, the Vermont Republican senator who quit the GOP over the right's highhandedness, causing Bush to lose his Senate majority in 2001? At this rate, Maine's Olympia Snowe, Ohio's George Voinovich, and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee could be driven out, too.

<p>And, in case an internal squabble over tax cuts isn't sufficient, we have the case of the gay-bashing Pennsylvania Republican senator. Senator Rick Santorum, a close ally of the religious right, said the other day that if the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that allows gays to be arrested for consensual sex in the privacy of their homes, it would encourage bigamy, incest, and adultery.

<p>A gay Republican group, the ironically named Republican Unity Coalition, has demanded, but not gotten, an apology. (Given this administration's policies on gay rights, would somebody remind me why any sane gay person votes Republican?)

<p>In the decade since Bill Clinton took office, broad tolerance of homosexuality has gone from an issue that divided Democrats to one that embarrasses Republicans. But, if you hear directly from God that homosexuality is a sin, why would you apologize?

<p>What all these episoides have in common is overweening arrogance - the pride that goeth before a fall (The radicals around Bush must have missed that part of the Good Book.) This is the occupational hazard of governing without checks and balances.

<p>To win elections, you need swing voters. The hard-core, partisan Republican vote is around 40 percent of the electorate; and the government-bashing, Bible-thumping, nuke-'em far-right electorate is substantially less than that.

<p>In the past, moderate Republicans saved this radical administration from itself - on tax and budget issues, on military adventures, and on tolerance issues. Now, the radicals want nothing less than total victory. They are inviting electoral defeat.
