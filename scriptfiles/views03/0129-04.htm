<p>I wish the people in Iraq would be able to dream of a happy new year. Unfortunately, thousands of them may soon be killed and thousands more maimed by bombing if America decides to attack the country. <P></P>Americans have made undeniable contributions to world culture and civilization. Among other things, they significantly contributed to the advancement of science, literature and the entertainment industry. <P></P>
The foreign policies of the U.S. government, however, have failed to a large extent to reflect the American people's values. Many Americans find it hard to relate to those policies. In fact, the harshest critics of U.S. foreign policies come from American citizens. 
<P></P>In his book <i>9-11</i>, American author Noam Chomsky says: "We shouldn't forget that the U.S. itself is a leading terrorist state," adding the U.S. is the only country condemned for international terrorism by the World Court. He cites examples of U.S. attacks in Nicaragua, Beirut, Sudan, and Iraq during and after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.<P></P>The U.S. government has been almost continuously at war with one country or another for the last 50 years. It is the only country to use atomic bombs to kill hundreds of thousands of civilians. <P></P>Under the banner of fighting terrorism, thousands of Afghans were killed last year. Russians are using the same banner to kill Chechens. The same goes for the Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and even President Robert Mugabe uses it in Zimbabwe. <P></P>What if other countries followed the U.S. in launching pre-emptive attacks on other countries? Could India attack Pakistan? China attack Taiwan?<P></P>Most worrisome are the messages perceived by the international community. If you are in doubt, attack. And if you are not militarily strong, you might be invaded. Could this lead to a new arms race?<P></P>
After a year of launching the war against terrorism, and in the name of protecting freedom, many freedoms are actually being diminished. The U.S. media are being manipulated. Dissent is labeled"siding with terrorism." The original target of war, Osama bin Laden, seems to have vanished into thin air and the despotic, unjust Taliban are still alive and well. <P></P>America's injured national pride won't be healed by war. No war, no act of revenge will bring loved ones back or ease their pain. If war and violence bring peace, then the Mideast would be the most peaceful area in the world. <P></P> Just imagine investing the money allocated for the Iraq war (more than $100 billion) on educating and creating jobs for the world's poor.<P></P>Today, the world lives in more fear and insecurity than ever.<P></P>Is the world slipping into the black hole of a new dark age, devoid of human rights and global justice? Are we wiping out real signs of civilization? <P></P>Flexing military muscles should be replaced by supporting fairness and spreading peace, compassion, tolerance and acceptance between nations. There is nothing Christian, or Muslim, in violence, war, arrogance or oil greed. <P></P>If we are interested in preventing future atrocities, then we should look for the reasons behind the past ones and admit to the West's contribution to their occurrence. <P></P>The culture of greed, hate and revenge should end.<P><i>Dr. Ali Mekky is a member of the Star's community editorial board.</i></p>
