<p>The other day my 6-year-old daughter asked me if I knew anything about "that war painting by Pablo ... Pablo Picasso." 

<p>"Do you mean Guernica?" I asked. "Yes, dad, that's the one. Do you know that painting? Do you have any books about him?"

<p>The next evening she and I spoke about Picasso and his various styles: "We're studying Picasso in school, dad. Did you know he had a blue period, and then a rose period, but it was really more like a red period because he painted more with red?" We talked about his harlequin paintings and about how many wives and children he had. 

<p>Mostly we talked about Guernica, and about the sadness of the woman on the left, holding her child.

</table></font>"At first I thought that lady was holding a turtle, dad," she said. "Now I think it's a baby. Is that her own baby she's holding? Is that baby dead? That's sad."

<p>We talked about the central horse — which she called a dragon — the knife in the severed hand at the bottom of the work, and about the screaming faces. She showed me things I had not seen before and I showed her things she had not seen before.

<p>All the while I was pleased to think that she had spent part of her school day talking about Picasso with her teacher and fellow Grade 1 students at the local public school she attends, about two blocks from home.

<p>After about 15 minutes we moved on to other topics: Her friends, her new pink boots, owls (which she is also studying), who is winning in our on-going games of tic-tac-toe, and how she likes the new Harry Potter movie, even though when we saw it a few weeks ago, she covered her eyes and asked me to cover her ears during the scary parts. 

<p>I am constantly amazed at how she moves back and forth so freely between the bad and the good, the scary and the funny, the simple and the complex. 

<p>Perhaps it's naïveté on her part, perhaps just childhood ignorance, but I do think it is more than that. 

<p>She absorbs what she needs or wants to, in a way that only children can, and then simply moves on. Chameleon-like, she adapts to her changing surroundings. At this marvelous age, she still doesn't worry too much, or overthink. 

<p>Everything, it seems, is of equal importance and everything is equally fascinating.

<p>Using her example, I am trying to dissociate myself from endlessly thinking about our various human weaknesses, both local and international. 

<p>I am trying to learn from my daughter how not to obsess about the bad, but rather to absorb it, process it, and then move on to other things. 

<p>Of course, I still look at the news too often and feel a tightness in my neck when I consider the horrific scenarios that seem to play themselves out on the neighborhood and world stage each day. By I'm trying.

<p>Perhaps this ability to ignore the bad, to forget the pain that we as humans are never far from, is the only way we are able to move forward in our lives.

<p>These days I've been reading Jonathon Shell's The Fate Of The Earth, which is certainly one of the most frightening books ever written about how we humans have chosen to create the opportunity for complete self-annihilation. 

<p>What keeps me thinking about my daughter is one of Shell's opening comments: "I hope in these reflections to proceed with the utmost possible respect for all forms of refusal to accept the unnatural and horrifying prospect of a nuclear holocaust." 

<p>Perhaps this "refusal to accept" is what we grown-ups do to enable ourselves to move from one day to the next. It is not as strong or as willful as my daughter's response, but it is similar, and it is a way to cope.

<p>Absolute refusal to accept the world around us is dangerous and self-defeating. 

<p>But some degree of refusal, or perhaps it is more a degree of acceptance, is essential. Otherwise, how could we cope with the unspeakable, indescribable horrors that seem always to threaten us? 

<p>I imagine we would be swallowed up by some destructive combination of pity, loathing and despair. 

<p>My daughter doesn't see her life like that. 

<p>She's just as interested in her ballet class, what we're having for dessert, and when we're going to go kite-flying again. 

<p>Last spring, when the trees in High Park were covered in blossoms, she and I sat halfway up one particularly beautiful tree and just talked about stuff. I'm looking forward to doing that again in the coming days.
