<p>So for a long time I bought into a common schema for the Bush administration: dim-bulb president surrounded and propped up by bright, ruthless neocons. Agenda included manifest destiny and manifest morality. Agents everywhere worked craftily to forward said agenda while getting very darn rich in the process. 

<p>I'm chagrined to admit now that I have, at least in part, bought into a lie. 

<p>I was sold a bill of goods. The neocons surrounding Bush are not all that bright, and their execution of their agenda has not been all that crafty. I am undecided whether this new revelation means that I think the administration is more or less scary. 

<p>At least some people in the Bush administration (Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney) have been planning to invade Iraq since at least 1998. You'd think, in all those years, they'd have had time to consider the ramifications of such an invasion. After all, a secure and prosperous peace in post-Saddam Iraq would be in the interest of the Bush administration, no matter what motives you ascribe to its actions. 

<p>But it is clear that they gave the reconstruction very little thought. In part, they believed their own myths; in part, they were just too lazy to read the literature on the known problems within Iraq and the obvious challenges to stability those problems would cause. These are not bright folks; give them flashy machines and big rhetoric, and they grin and bobble like promotional dolls. 


<p>Max Rodenbeck, the Cairo correspondent for the Economist (not a left-wing magazine by any stretch of the imagination), has <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16513" target="_new">a very telling essay</a> on this matter in the Aug. 14 issue of the New York Review of Books. He has the advantage over many other reporters on the scene: He speaks Arabic; he lives in a Muslim country; he has read the reports from various pro-Western nongovernmental organizations. 

<p>I urge you to check out the entire article; I shall provide only some suggestive samples. One has to do with the malign effect of the Oil for Food program on the lives of everyday Iraqis: 

<p>"Iraqis still have a glazed, resentful expression when they talk about 'The Siege.' Every schoolchild knows what Madeleine Albright told an audience in Ohio in 1996: 'We think the price is worth it.' In the Shiite south, the resentment turns to anger when they recall that the No-Fly Zone, resulting in a trickle of dead, was always described as having been established to protect civilians from the regime (of Saddam Hussein). This was despite the fact that it was imposed after the regime had finished slaughtering tens of thousands of them, crushing the 1991 uprising while the first President Bush abandoned the Shiites to their fate." 

<p>This particular historical fact is deeply embarrassing to the administration, so it chose to pretend it didn't really happen. 

<p>Rodenbeck also writes about the inappropriate training and equipment received by American troops. 

<p>"In numerous situations, Iraqi civilians have been killed either because American soldiers were unable to communicate such simple instructions as Stop, or because troops answered perceived threats with lethal gunfire rather than crowd control measures. Giant tanks, massive self-propelled artillery and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, with their 25-millimeter chain guns firing up to five hundred rounds per minute, are not much good for peacekeeping. On the other hand, thin-skinned Humvees offer little protection from the self- propelled grenades that are ubiquitous in Iraq." 

<p>The outcome of the war was certain before it started; the probable aftermath of the war had been predicted with considerable accuracy. The fact that lives on both sides are being lost because experts failed to do their homework is criminal. It's our country now; we'd better get smart about running it. 



<p>I suppose it's good that our villains are incompetent, and yet it isn't.
