<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND, JULY 2: I am watching telly as they
 say here, tuning into Live 8, live from London&#8217;s Hyde
 Park, with Robbie Williams once more rocking us as we
 flash back and flash forward with another mega-rock show
 for a big cause. 

 <p>Many thought that singer Bob Geldof&#8217;s time came and went,
 but now, 20 years later, it&#8217;s back again as billions tune
 into a string of concerts attended by over a million and a
 half being held in ten cities on four continents described
 as THE LONG WALK TO JUSTICE. The big bands are back
 singing for Africa but this time as only one part of a
 larger campaign, and not just a charitable one, demanding
 a real change in the world. There are also other players
 this time around but the pop concert drew far more
 detailed attention than the political activists did.

<p>There were leading NGOs and lobbyists advocating for
 fairer trade, debt reduction and more aid. They have come
 up with policy proposals that already seem be embraced by
 some G-8 governments. Using celebrities and media
 campaigns and protests called MAKE POVERTY HISTORY, they
 have mobilized hundreds of thousands to take to the
 streets as they did here in Edinburgh Saturday. 

 <p>They came by train and by car and by literally hundreds of
 coaches, older church people and swarms of students and
 young activists eager to send a message to the world
 leaders descending on Gleneagles early next week. Some in
 the anarchist &#8216;black block&#8217; wrapped in bandanas and
 chanting revolutionary slogans were blocked by cops from
 joining the march. Most poured into the streets peacefully
 with signs and good cheer. There was even a battalion of
 young costumed circus-liked characters in camouflage
 get-up organized as the &#8216;CLANDESTINE INSURGENT REBEL CLOWN
 ARMY.&#8217; (True!) 

 <p>The demo paraded around town in waves for hours, 18 people
 across. Through blocked off main streets and then back to
 a meadow where activists groups set up tents to sell their
 wares and stages to talk politics and play political
 songs. I heard Billy Bragg, saw Bianca Jagger and chatted
 with economist-writer Noreena Hertz about great it is that
 people are finally marching for global economic justice
 and not just against the policies or wars they hate. There
 was a sense of heady optimism in the air as in &#8216;we are
 putting the issues of the poor on the public agenda and
 forcing powerful governments from the rich world to
 respond.&#8217; 

<p> And as I write these words, back on the TV, the WHO
 punctuate the point by declaring &#8220;we won&#8217;t be fooled
 again&#8217; as the lucky fans who scored tickets raise their
 fists in the air like they did when they first heard the
 song. Throughout the world artists endorsed calls for
 action on the issue. Speaking to a concert in
 Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela said it would be a crime
 against humanity if governments ignored the demands of the
 public. &#8220;Do not look the other way,&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;We want
 action.&#8221; His was the only real political statement I heard
 in two hours of prime-time programming that kept calling
 it &#8220;the day that changed the world.&#8221;

 <p>But there is something else going on here that the BBC is
 not drawing attention too&#8212;its presenters are more into
 sappy and banal rock star adoration like asking the likes
 of George Michael if he is going to tour again than
 exploring the larger meaning and mission of the show.
 Artists and TV presenters saying &#8220;what a great day&#8221; was a
 diversion from the objective. A Christ-like Bono
 proclaimed they were there not for charity but for
 &#8220;justice&#8221; but little detail was offered about what that
 means in the songs or from the stage where entertainment
 was dominant and edification virtually non-existent.

 <p> At the same time, the visibility that TV stations have
 given the issue inspired 26 Million people to access the
 Live 8 website and add their names to a list of
 supporters. How many of those supporters will become
 activists remains to be seen. Will they heed Geldof&#8217;s
 earlier call to &#8220;converge&#8221; on the G-8 or just go home
 agreeing with his later post show pronouncement of &#8220;JOB
 DONE&#8221;? As far as I can tell, those plans for a million to
 march on the summit are not as detailed as the logistics
 that made the concert so successful. Rock stars are
 showmen who organize events, not revolutions.

 <p>The more relevant question is: have the rock stars been
 seduced by Tony Blair who is desperate to recast an image
 battered by his association with Bush and bloodshed in
 Basra?  Have they been deceived by politicians used to
 making pledges that they don&#8217;t honor (as in the case of
 the Tsunami) while thinking they have persuaded the
 politicians to new levels of caring and commitment? Geld
 was part of an Africa Commission chaired by Blair which
 calls for change but in a free market-pro private sector
 direction.

  <p>Is this campaign serious about transforming power
 relations and redistributing wealth and resources or is it
 content to wrest symbolic concessions that look good but
 in real terms are not very significant?

 These questions were raised by a third force in this
 movement&#8212;the popular stop the war campaign. The Make
 Poverty History wouldn&#8217;t allow them to march with their
 own banners in the big parade or speak at their rally
 inviting suspicion that the Blairites were stage-managing
 the protests from the shadows. (The British government
 actually funded some of the organizing undertaken by
 Oxfam, which now has former staffers advising Blair&#8217;s
 people while ex-government functionaries now work with the
 charity.) Tony Blair Chancellor Gordon Brown supported the
 protests. Was there a deal here between the popsters and
 the pols that we don&#8217;t know about?

<p> The Stop the War coalitions suggests there was. They want
 to make both war and poverty history and argue that the
 former contributes to the latter pointing to all the money
 spent on the world&#8217;s militaries and the destruction of
 Iraq and the growing impoverishment of its people.

<p> They say that the G-8 is not the solution but the problem
 and the rich nations are rich by keeping the poor nations
 poor. &#8220;Tony Blair has forged a false consensus promoting
 the idea that we have a shared view of what&#8217;s wrong and
 how to make it right,&#8221; argued George Monbiot, the
 brilliant Guardian columnist who contends that the people
 protesting and the people in power are enemies with
 different world views and needs. He says that the Bushes
 and the Blairs are promoting an illusion that they care as
 deeply as the people pressing them to act.  The former are
 promoting the neo-liberal agenda that the protesters are
 resisting. 

 The high point of their rally was a fiery address by
 Member of Parliament George Galloway who now runs the
 RESPECT Party (www.respectcoalition.org) and devastated US
 Senator Norm Coleman (R-Minn) who accused him of profiting
 from the UN&#8217;s Oil for Food Program. Galloway made
 mincemeat of his accusation and today was one of the few
 speakers to challenge Sir Bob Geldof and what he mocked as
 &#8220; Sir Bono, because he soon will be&#8221; for playing up to and
 lobbying Bush and Blair rather than confronting and
 denouncing them as war criminals. They were critical of
 how Blair is posing as Africa&#8217;s champion while deflecting
 debate about the ongoing war that is eating up resources
 and lives. Their slogan is &#8220;It takes Respect to Get
 Respect.&#8221; And Blair is not someone they respect.

<p> &#8220;We are here to spoil the party and bust its illusions,&#8221;
 he said to on their feet activists who cheered him wildly. 
 RESPECT insists that the debt relief that has been
 announced is only a quarter of the amount of money spent
 in invading Iraq.  They note that the amount pledged by
 the US is less than the amount spent annually on cat and
 dog food, and that Britain is selling arms to many of the
 poorest countries in the world.

 <p>In other words, while the music was often sensational and
 the passion strong, there are powerful interests in
 conflict so that making poverty history will require a far
 more fundamental transformation than most of the marchers
 and the musicians seem to realize. This concern was
 ignored and downplayed in most of the feel good media
 outlets I saw as conservative newspapers like the Daily
 Mail fashionably praised demonstrators who they usually
 dismiss. All the new found concern for Africa has driven
 the bloodshed in Iraq off the airwaves and the G-8 agenda.
 (The Sunday OBSERVER brought Iraq back with a report that
 Britain is helping to subsidize horrendous torture and
 human rights abuse in Iraq that sounds like it came from
 Saddam&#8217;s playbook.)

<p> Live 8 ended with a nostalgic grand finale sing-along of
 &#8220;Hey Jude,&#8221; a song that Sir Paul McCartney wrote for John
 Lennon&#8217;s son Julian after his father was killed. No one
 reminded viewers that it was McCartney who organized a
 pro-patriotic post 911 concert in New York that jeered
 those who called for peace. His own song urged a &#8220;fight
 for freedom,&#8221; a slogan the Bush Administration adopted as
 the battle cry of its GWOT (Global War on Terror.) 

 <p>And yet at the same time, these forces that are now
 debating ending poverty in the parks, and in alternative
 summits are raising issues that have been relatively
 invisible in our politics and the media. Expectations for
 change are high, as is hope that the G8 will rise to the
 moment. That&#8217;s asking a lot from politicians who have on
 the whole done so little for so long to help so many even
 as more debt will be cancelled and aid increased. Note
 also that G8 is not a representative body even of economic
 power-China and Brazil are excluded.

<p> Its now up to the media to track what happens now, to
 separate the heroes from the hypocrites, to assess the
 political impact and follow-up on whether the poor of the
 world will be, as many expect, disappointed and forgotten
 again. What is needed writes one columnist in Britain is
 more rage, not rock.

 <p>More militant protests are coming. All Eyes on Scotland.
