<p>Politically, I’ve been asleep at the wheel for fifty-five years. I woke up early in
2003. Citizen Van Winkle!  I did vote every four years, just barely. Registered as an independent, I generally selected the candidate I disliked the least. I often wondered why we have only two major political parties; why not five or six? Life is not so simple as liberal Vs. conservative, hot vs. cold, up vs. down, black vs. white; much gray area does exist.  The majority of Americans live in the middle not on the extreme fringes, not on the poles but in the temperate zone. A lot of us in the gray, temperate middle do not even vote. I know because I work alongside them in a factory: “It makes no difference,” they say, “why should I vote? Both the big parties are in the pockets of big money. They pass laws for big money
not for the middle class. Money talks.”  I nodded in agreement and resumed my slumber.   

<p>Although I understood that big campaign contributions bought big favors in Washington, DC, I also assumed that Congress would not pass laws detrimental to the middle class. That assumption proved wrong. In 1998 a small bump in the road almost woke me up. I read a book which pointed out the fact that real working wages for non-supervisory personnel in the United States had been declining since 1973, a fact which surprised and troubled me, since I incorrectly assumed again that both democracy and prosperity had been expanding all through the 20th century for all Americans. False assumption. Next bump was the 2000 Presidential election fiasco and the appointment of an American president by the Supreme Court rather than a revote by the valid electorate, the people; those nine citizens are not that supreme. From the year 2000 on, the road got much bumpier. The Enron meltdown brought to my attention to deregulation; I was unaware that public utilities were being deregulated. If its not broke, why fix it?  Deregulate a monopoly like electricity?  You got to be joking. Public utility monopolies like water, gas, electric do not lend themselves to competition but rather to manipulation: just plain common sense tells me that and no bought expert is going to convince me otherwise. Regulation is simply necessary. 

<p>More road bumps: no inheritance tax, say what?  no dividend tax? say what? no limits on the extent of media ownership, say what? invade Iraq, say what?  So, by the spring of 2003 I was fully awake and asking myself, what the hell is going on here?  How do these changes benefit the middle class? Has Congress lost its collective mind? Are they for the middle class or against the middle class? 

<p>A famous quote by Abraham Lincoln ends: “But you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.”  The present bunch of bandits in Washington, DC has arrived at this limit. Do they think that the middle class has no common sense? Wrong.  Plain and simple common sense tells us in the gray, temperate middle much about the workings of modern American life:
<ul>
<li>Election Day: Why isn’t this day a national holiday?  The most important 
product that America has ever produced, our major export to the world, is democracy and we should treat it with more respect. Common sense. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs: Why have they gone out of fashion? They were a good source of 
revenue and protected the American worker. The only thing free about free trade is the labor.  In the year 2003, the prevailing wage of $. 38 hour in China and India is surrealistic. The American workers in manufacturing cannot compete and every manufacturing job that goes overseas hurts the middle class. Jobs are getting too scarce. Common sense. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Corporate Mergers and Consolidation: How does reducing the ranks of competition benefit the middle class?  The creation of super corporations only gives rise to the closure of factories, employee downsizing, excessive CEO compensation, insider trading, offshore corporations to evade federal income taxes, and an arrogant employer attitude which growls, “Be grateful you still have a job, Mr. Middle Class.”  This disturbing 30 year trend does not well serve the middle class. Common sense. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment Rate: The posted national rate of 6.1% is a joke, a mockery of a true measure. Since this fantasy rate does not capture the people whose benefits have expired, those who have given up the job search, those who are working part-time, those who are working for wages much less than the former job, and those who are working two really bad jobs just to make ends meet, the real rate of unemployment is likely to be closer to 20%. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Wage:  At $5.15 hour, this is another national joke among the middle class. A more accurate title would be The Minimum Wage for a High School Student Working Part Time After School. Common sense. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bush Tax Cuts: How did he get Congress to pass this skewed legislation?  If entirely abolished, the inheritance tax will indeed become the slick slogan of  “death tax”, for it will be the death of democracy, endowing and legitimizing an American aristocracy. To escape a feudal system of vassal and serf was one of the primary reasons the early settlers of America left Europe and established our nation, a free land of opportunity, not one of birth privilege. Keep the tax; raise the exemption. Common sense. Likewise with the dividend tax, the capital gains tax, even the income tax: do not reduce the rate, rather increase the exemption, an approach that would benefit a majority of the middle class rather than a few at the top. Big money buys big favors and we of the middle know that we suffer as Congress is manipulated. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Price of Gasoline: Here is a perfect example of the fallacy of free markets. If the cost of a barrel of crude oil has remained relatively constant for about twenty years, why has the price of a gallon of gasoline risen from $. 85 to $1.60??  Common sense tells us why: too many mergers, too few players, more collusion than competition. Spike the price of a gallon every summer to $1.90, and the numb middle class hardly grumbles nowadays, knowing that the purchased politicians will side with big money but not with the middle class of real diminishing wages who must drive to work and the store, also knowing that in the near future that big money will get another merger approved and the price will be even more manipulated. Common sense. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gated Communities: What the hell is going on here? What are these people afraid of?  I find this disturbing trend very un-American: a scenario from a Latin American nation of rich and poor with no middle class. Do these residents of the gated communities know the middle class is shrinking? Are they preparing for the future?  The construction of every new gated community is another nail in the coffin of the concept of the land of the free and the home of the brave. Common sense. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Made in China: It’s getting harder to find goods that say Made in USA. Go into any retail store and examine the label or the package for the country of origin. Most likely it will identify some low wage country like Mexico or China, and China is just ramping up, warming up to hit stride. The dent put in American manufacturing over the last thirty years by Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia and Mexico will be bumper car size in comparison to the impact of the hit from China: one billion people and an average wage of $. 38 hour. Ouch!  The big hurt on the middle class. Does Washington, DC feel our pain? Not quite. The anesthetic of big money has made them immune, and year after year manufacturing moves offshore, furthering the decline of working wages in real dollars. The ability to manufacture created the American middle class; the loss of manufacturing will erode the middle class; we have 30 years of statistical proof. We need to wake up and halt this trend. Common sense. We of the middle class can no longer sleep on our watch, for our children will suffer for our slumber. </li></ul>
