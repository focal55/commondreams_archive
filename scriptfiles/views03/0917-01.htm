<p>The failure of the world trade talks in Cancun, Mexico, was highly probable before the meeting started. The chance of failure escalated to all-but-certain soon after negotiations got underway.

<p>The reason was obvious, and depressingly familiar. 

<p>The rich countries — the U.S., the European Union, Japan, and with Canada tagging along — don't need the poor countries. So why offer them more than a few tidbits — and these only to distract critics back home — rather than actually help by cutting tariffs and reducing subsidies on the agricultural products that are the poor nations' best chance of hard currency exports?

<p>For the talks to fail in the way they did, suddenly and totally, though, required an additional X factor. It came in the form of an expression of unconcealed contempt. 

<p>This round of trade liberalization talks by the World Trade Organization started two years ago in Doha, Qatar. Unlike previous rounds, it was to be about helping poor countries to haul themselves up by their bootstraps economically by way of free trade. In the WTO's discussion paper at Doha, the word "development" occurred 68 times in just 10 pages.

<p>To test whether any of the rich countries actually meant any of their rhetoric, ministers from four African countries — Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali — each of them among the poorest in the world, met at Cancun with U.S. trade representative Robert Zoellick to discuss the effect on world agricultural trade of the U.S. cotton subsidies.

<p>There are 25,000 cotton farmers in the U.S. They produce $3 billion worth of cotton each year. And each year they receive $4 billion in subsidies.

<p>Besides American taxpayers, those who pay for those subsidies are the cotton farmers in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali and other Central and West African countries. There are 10 million of them. Most live on less than $2 a day. 

<p>They could earn a lot more, and their countries export more, but subsidized American cotton has caused world cotton prices to tumble, costing African farmers at least $1 billion a year.

<p>In reply to a plea that America live up to the WTO's own rules, as well as to the rhetoric of the Doha round, Zoellick told his visitors that what was already on offer — no cuts in subsidies but a vague plan to help build up African textile industries — was all they were going to get.

<p>The Africans then joined the so-called Group of 20-plus, headed by Brazil, and including such heavyweights among the developing countries as China, India and Indonesia, in walking out of the talks.

<p>Blame shouldn't be applied only to the U.S. and to Zoellick (who, anyway, was only following his brief to leave cotton subsidies untouched until after the presidential election). 

<p>Agricultural subsidies of all kinds total an incredible $300 billion U.S. By far the worst agricultural subsidy offenders are Japan and Europe. Moreover, at Cancun the Europeans contributed mightily to the failure by insisting the poor countries discuss new investment and competition rules before negotiations on agricultural tariffs and subsidies could even be completed.

<p>Incidentally, Canada's role at Cancun was non-existent. Our delegates did say some nice things about the Africans, but we made no move to actually help them. The reality is that with 85 per cent of our trade now with the U.S., and governed by NAFTA rules, we no longer have much interest in multilateral trade or in the WTO.

<p>To look closely at rich-poor, or North-South, trade is to look directly at a nightmare. The U.S. collects more in tariffs from its trade with Bangladesh than from its trade with France. Japan imposes 1,000 per cent subsidies on imported rice. Mozambique loses as much because of European sugar subsidies as it gets from European foreign aid. 

<p>And past agreements get broken. Industrial countries have pledged to eliminate their textile quotas by 2005. By now, three-quarters should have gone. Instead, the U.S. still maintains 80 per cent, and Europe 70 per cent, of textile quotas.

<p>Even the one response available to the poor countries — ensuring that the Cancun talks failed — may not help them. The offers to them were minimal, almost risible, but now there'll be no trade liberalization at all.

<p>There may be a retreat from multilateral liberalization if the United States, as it has threatened, now ignores the WTO to do one-on-one pacts with favored countries (like Australia).

<p>It's been said many times that what's needed as an integral part of the war on terror is a war on poverty. 

<p>At Cancun, the U.S., but no less so Europe and Japan, turned their backs on the poor (with Canada simply looking the other way). The unresolved question is whether more of the poor will now become terrorists.
