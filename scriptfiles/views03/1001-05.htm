<p>When the Clinton administration was accused of easing restrictions on the sharing of sensitive information with China after accepting campaign contributions from sources close to the Chinese government, this newspaper supported congressional and independent investigations. Clinton haters hijacked those inquiries and turned them into cheap examinations of the president's sex life - cheating the American people out of the answers they had a right to demand. 

<p>Those abuses of the process turned some Americans against the use of independent counsels to augment congressional inquiries. But we continue to recognize the value of both approaches to seeking the truth. 

<p>Our reasoning for supporting the investigation of the China connection to Clinton was based on a core value of this newspaper: The executive branch should never be allowed to abuse its power to achieve petty political goals. 

<p>That same thinking underpins our support for congressional inquiries and an independent investigation of charges the Bush administration "outed" an undercover CIA agent in retribution for her husband's criticism of Bush's manipulation of intelligence before the Iraq war. 


<p>It is disgusting that partisans are now attempting to dismiss concerns that the Bush White House sought to punish a critic, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV, with leaks of information that might have endangered his wife and undermined CIA operations that have sought to investigate weapons of mass destruction. Bush defenders who retreat to the "our president can do no wrong" position look every bit as intellectually dishonest as Clinton defenders who did the same. 

<p>The bottom line is this: President Bush and his aides stand accused of involving themselves in a serious crime - exposing the identity of a Central Intelligence Agency operative. Former President George Herbert Walker Bush, an outspoken advocate of the law making it a crime to expose the identities of CIA operatives, has referred to the leaking of an agent's identity as a form of treason. 

<p>Yet Republicans in Congress seem to be reluctant to investigate the concerns expressed by CIA Director George Tenet, who has asked the U.S. Justice Department to open a criminal investigation. AttorneyGeneral John Ashcroft's Justice Department has been slow to act, but now appears to be moving on the issue. Concerns about whether Ashcroft will finish the job have led to calls for an independent investigation. Considering the failures of the Congress to address this issue and the suspicions about Ashcroft and his aides, it seems only reasonable that an independent investigation be authorized. 

<p>Those who attempt to dismiss this matter are not merely defending a president who, if he had any knowledge of political retaliation of this kind, is no more fit to serve in the nation's highest office than Richard Nixon was in 1974. They are placing party ahead of country - a wrong for which they savaged the defenders of former President Clinton. 

<p>Imagine if the Clinton administration stood accused of illegally identifying an intelligence agent. The calls for impeachment would have been so loud that nothing else would be done in Washington. 

<p>Bush's critics have, for the most part, been more restrained. That is appropriate. But no one, no matter what their party, should hesitate to demand that investigators find the answers to two questions: 

<p>Who, if anyone, in the administration leaked information about Wilson's wife? 

<p>What did the president know, and when did he know it?
