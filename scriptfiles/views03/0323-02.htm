<p>One of the spookiest symptoms of war fever is the way it debases language and herds people into ideological quarantine. As communication breaks down, ever more unrestrained behavior becomes acceptable against one's opponents, who eventually loom as simply The Enemy.

<P></P> With what glee, for instance, has the U.S. been trashing the French lately, as though the silver lining in the war on terror has been liberation from the restraints of political correctness.<P></P> I remind all mockingly self-righteous commentators that traffic in crude stereotypes has had ugly consequences; and already the gutter press is amplifying the menace of its anti-Europe jibes with barbaric overtones. "If we'd sprinkled some A-bombs back in World War II," opined the Weekly World News, "Germany wouldn't be a thorn in America's side today." The unthinkable begins in small rivulets of hatred. War fever feeds on this.<P></P> And so it is excruciating to watch the deterioration of discourse at the level of national leadership. In lieu of retaining its power to declare war, Congress changed its menu. This great deliberative body has chosen to dumb itself into the role of trivial cheerleader for unilateralism, giving us &#8212; sacre bleu &#8212; freedom fries to chew on.<P></P> Freedom fries are to freedom what french fries are to the potato: nutritionally empty slivers of something that once kept people alive.<P></P> As Adlai Stevenson once said, it hurts too much to laugh and I'm too big to cry. Groping to express my dismay at such grim foolishness, I recall, also, what Susan Sontag wrote in the New Yorker soon after Sept. 11, calling the wrath of the righteous down on herself:<P></P> "Let's by all means grieve together. But let's not be stupid together."<P></P> This is exactly what we're doing. Sontag was referring to the groupthink spewing out over the airwaves, fixated on vengeance and devoid of any historical awareness that could lead to an understanding of what had happened.<P></P> Ultimately, the U.S. will have to own up to the paradox of who it is: not just beacon of democracy to the world but also arrogant protector of its economic and ideological interests and interferer in the self-determination of other peoples. U.S. foreign policy, right or wrong, has set fires of resentment smoldering throughout the Third World. Sept. 11 didn't happen in a vacuum.<P></P> Marcy Kaptur, Democratic congresswoman from Ohio, merely suggested, earlier this month, that Osama bin Laden is a member of the human race and acts for reasons Americans are capable of recognizing. She might as well have spat on the flag. "What faces us is a rising revolution being felt across repressive regimes of the Arab and Islamic world," she told the Toledo Blade. "The American people understand the power of revolution."<P></P> Kaptur was urging the U.S. to apply a little sympathetic savvy to the phenomenon of aggrieved, transnational Islam.<P></P> It was too much for a political leadership that can't even stomach the sovereignty of France. <P></P>Thomas Reynolds, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, accused Kaptur of "equating Osama bin Laden with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and our other founding fathers."<P></P> 

This isn't thought. This isn't discussion. Most of all, this is not a defense of the founding fathers or their concept of a government of checks and balances. It's a defense of cheap plastic figurines up on the national knick-knack shelf.
