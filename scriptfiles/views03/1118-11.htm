<p>This week trade ministers from 34 countries gather in Miami for what has been 
billed as the final round of negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas. 
By any standards, this is a hugely ambitious exercise. At issue is whether the 
Miami meeting will reinforce the growing inequalities that are the hallmark of 
current patterns of globalization, or instead, support a more equitable international 
trading system that benefits all countries. <p>The Free Trade Area of the Americas, 
or FTAA, will create a free trade zone stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. 
Desperately poor communities in the Peruvian highlands and the slums of Rio de 
Janeiro will be connected to a common market with the world's richest country, 
the United States. Under the FTAA, the same trade and financial rules will be 
applied to all, regardless of wealth. <p>Will the FTAA help to combat poverty 
in a region where more than 200 million people live on the margins? Will these 
rules secure a reasonable distribution of benefits between the FTAA's richer and 
poorer members? <p>There is no denying the potential benefits of open markets 
and foreign investment for Latin America. But the problem with the framework proposed 
by the U.S. government for the FTAA is that it envisages a rules-based regime 
that would enforce a blueprint for wholesale deregulation of developing country 
markets while maintaining unfair advantages for U.S. domestic industries - in 
the same sectors in which developing countries have the best chance of competing 
and lifting millions out of poverty. <p>What would the consequences be if the 
FTAA were adopted in its current form? First, governments would lose the right 
to discriminate in favor of small-scale domestic industries, to require the transfer 
of skills and technology, and to restrict profit repatriation. If the recent history 
of Latin America teaches anything, it is that unregulated open markets, rapid 
import liberalization and the absence of essential government regulation and public 
services is bad for growth, bad for stability, and disastrous for poverty reduction. 
<p>Second, under the FTAA unfair agricultural trade with the United States will 
continue. The U.S. position on agriculture in the FTAA negotiations can be summarized 
in two words: no negotiations. The United States maintains that the appropriate 
place to discuss agriculture is the World Trade Organization. Yet at the recent 
WTO ministerial meeting in Cancún, Mexico, no agreement was reached that would 
address the $50 billion that the United States provides annually in support to 
its domestic agriculture producers. This support generates vast surpluses that 
are sold in other countries at prices less than their costs of production. <p>An 
editorial in The New York Times on Nov. 10 (" Weaning U.S. farmers off aid," IHT, 
Nov. 11) made this criticism of U.S. farm subsidies: "It's astonishing that a 
program can continue to get congressional support when it hurts virtually everybody 
our representatives are supposed to be concerned about - small farmers, other 
taxpayers and poorer nations struggling to join the global economy." <p>Efficient 
exporters such as Argentina and Brazil suffer the consequences in terms of reduced 
prices and lost market share. Meanwhile, impoverished corn farmers in Mexico and 
rice farmers in Honduras and Haiti have to compete in local markets against subsidized 
imports. Of course, they cannot compete - and countless livelihoods are being 
destroyed. This issue is of key importance to all developing countries and must 
be addressed if the international trade system is to be seen as contributing to 
the development of the world's poorest regions. <p>Agriculture is the fundamental 
issue for developing countries, while market access, deregulation of investment 
and strong patent rules are of crucial importance to the United States. In these 
nonagricultural issues, the U.S. negotiating agenda for Miami is too ambitious. 
At Cancún, developing countries comprehensively rejected European Union demands 
for rules on the liberalization of investment and services, but the United States 
has placed these at the top of its list of priorities. And to show that it means 
business, it recently demanded that Costa Rica opens up industries like telecommunications, 
electricity and insurance. <p>Intellectual property is another area in which the 
United States has adopted a negotiating stance at variance with the needs of Latin 
America. Under its proposals, the FTAA would enshrine far stronger protection 
for patent holders than provided for in WTO rules. The upshot would be an increase 
in the cost of technology transfer and rising prices for medicines as U.S. patent 
holders use the FTAA to enforce the highest prices. For Latin America the flip 
side would be reduced innovation and deteriorating public health. <p>In many respects, 
the Miami meeting represents a crossroads in international trade negotiations. 
For the United States, the exercise appears to be part of a wider post-Cancún 
strategy which undermines multilateralism and the WTO. Increasingly, the preferred 
option seems to be recourse to bilateralism and regional agreements in which U.S. 
power can overcome the resistance of developing countries. <p>The danger is that 
the FTAA will become the harbinger of a new form of unequal trade treaty imposed 
through power politics. Ultimately, this is in nobody's interest - including that 
of the United States. Millions of American jobs depend on prosperity in other 
countries, and on the stability that a multilateral system of rules can provide. 
Imposing unequal trade treaties will be bad for millions of the world's poorest 
people, who stand to be excluded from the potential benefits of globalization. 
Disillusion with the current system is at the heart of recent unrest in a number 
of countries of the region. This puts at risk the democratic reforms that spread 
across Latin America during the 1990's. The last thing the United States needs 
is a political powder keg to the south. Putting the development needs of people 
at the center of the FTAA negotiations is the best way to prevent a return to 
authoritarianism and conflict. <p><I>The writer is honorary president of Oxfam
