<p>What the Bush administration considers irrelevant is any organization or country 
that doesn’t have a meaningful military. Their military - and it is the Bush administration’s 
military, not ours – has the power to back up ultimatums. Their logic seems to 
be, if you don’t have a meaningful military you’re not worth dealing with; if 
you do have a meaningful military, you will be dealt with – one way or another. 
What will keep the world in a death grip is the logic that mega force should be 
allowed to move policy and shift ownership. Is it any wonder that there is a lust 
for weaponry throughout the globe? With the Bush posture aiming itself at the 
world it makes painful sense that leaders looking to stay in power, and countries 
looking to keep their sovereignty and their resources would buy, develop and build 
the weapons necessary to ease the sense of helplessness that Bush, Rice and Rumsfeld 
feel compelled to cultivate in the minds of various world leaders. 
<p>Bush says he does not want the U.N. to be weak as he does everything in his 
power to weaken it. Countries that oppose invasion and are committed to the process 
being orchestrated by the U.N., are considered disloyal. But in fact, those whose 
motives are questionable are the ones questioning their motives. The protests, 
which Bush has dismissed as something akin to “focus groups,” are giving a vote 
of no confidence to the man, whom this congress has given the individual, unchallenged 
right to unleash his “might military.” Congressional abdication has led to an 
international outcry against Bush being the man who controls the fate of the world. 
In their minds, he is not only not president but he is perceived to be a dangerous 
and thuggish commander-in-chief who can have the military do the bidding of an 
agenda that is both foggy and strident. 
<p>The secretiveness of the Bush backers as they make decisions and leak certain 
information, enflames suspicions. The equation of “with us or with the terrorists” 
could have a boomerang effect if he continues to promote his simplistic solutions 
for complex problems. Yes – it can all be reduced to simple measures – hit them 
before they hit us – but what the international collective psyche sees is a celebrity 
armada not in the service of a political philosophy or in defense of borders, 
but a quasi-mercenary force sent to collect payment due. Bush does speak like 
the Wasp version of a Mafia Don, and the rest of the world, and a few “focus groups” 
here, have the psychological strength to react to it. 
<p>As the coordinated efforts of diplomacy and military threats yield results 
the very people who called for these results reject them. It’s “process not substance” 
protests Powell. How else does one get to substance but through a process? The 
people who have taken the reins of our government and military want the magic 
bullet. World citizens have a mingling of fear and hope. They see Bush as irrelevant 
- and illegitimate. A North Korean soldier interviewed by the BBC says he hates 
Bush “because he called us evil.” As a writer it’s a stinging reminder to know 
how potent and damaging words can be. 
<p>The greatest power we have is the compassionate sense of identity that filled 
the streets of New York and other cities throughout the country. The world needed 
to see that. Baghdad and North Korea needed to see that. Bush’s prescription for 
protecting the American people doesn’t quite add up. His paternal concern seems 
neurotic, false and suspect. What the people did this past Saturday did more to 
protect us than all of Bush’s petulant and clumsy rhetoric. 
<p>The Iraqi regime may not have a change of heart, but it will change – it is 
being pressed to change. Protestors do not seem to be protesting this pressure, 
but they want it on record that they do not want “shock and awe.” It appears, 
according to Hans Blix, that incrementally Iraq is defending itself by exposing 
its neck to the dominant pack member and thereby saving itself. The dominant pack 
member doesn’t care to see this. It seems to want blood and the “irrelevant” protestors 
and the “irrelevant” U.N. is saying, “Wait” to the alpha wolf. The question that 
hangs in the middle of our collective living room is if the protestors and the 
U. N. succeed, who then becomes irrelevant? And can the fragile psyche and the 
bold plans of the Bush cabal be content to take a seat? 
<p>Beyond the inspirational display of humanity that Bush brushed aside, the other 
harbinger he might try to comprehend is that most of the country, on President’s 
Day 2003, was forced by Nature to declare a state of emergency.</i></p>
