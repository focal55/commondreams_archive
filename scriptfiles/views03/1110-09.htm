<p>NEW YORK -- When World War I broke out, the English saw going off to battle as a fine thing to do. They embraced the Roman poet Horace's dictum, "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" - It is sweet and proper to die for one's country. But four years later, that romantic notion had been shattered by the grim reality of the mustard-gas-laced killing fields, and by the bitter words of Wilfred Owen, a British officer now recognized as the greatest poet of the Great War. The war he witnessed was full of blood "gargling" up from "froth-corrupted lungs" and "vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues."
<p>Owen's subject was, he declared, "war, and the pity of war." He expressed it through dark word portraits, in which dead and dying young men were stripped of any glory or sentimentality. Owen himself was killed in action at the age of 25, just days before the war's end, 85 years ago this week.
<p>Owen is often portrayed as antiwar, which he was not. What he stood for was seeing war clearly, which makes him especially relevant today. The Bush administration has been loudly attacking the news media for misreporting the Iraq conflict by leaving out good news. Owen would counter - in vivid, gripping images - that it is the White House, with its campaign to hide casualties from view, that is dangerously distorting reality.
<p>When the clouds of war were gathering, Owen was embarking on a literary life. Like many young British men, he was caught up in war fever. As Dominic Hibberd, a leading Owen scholar, relates in a recent biography, Owen reacted to the German threat by writing a poem in which he approvingly cited Horace's dictum, adding that it was "sweeter still" to die in war "with brothers." He wrote to his mother, "I now do most intensely want to fight."
<p>Owen got his wish. He volunteered for the army in the autumn of 1915, and was sent to France. Before long, Owen was nearly killed by a German sniper. Then, while stumbling in the dark, he fell into a pit and ended up with a concussion. "I have suffered seventh hell," he wrote his mother.
<p>A large shell exploded near his head weeks later, throwing him into the air, and another, ghoulishly, exhumed a comrade, depositing his corpse nearby. Owen was haunted by blood-soaked dreams and, after a diagnosis of shell shock, he was committed to a war hospital. He befriended a fellow patient, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, and embarked on his most prolific period of writing.
<p>While convalescing, Owen wrote his greatest work, "Dulce et Decorum Est," in which he provided a biting new take on Horace's assessment of death in battle. The poem, an account of a gas attack, concludes by caustically telling the reader that if he had been there, <i>"you would not tell with such high zest/To children ardent for some desperate glory/ The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est/Pro patria mori."
</i>
<p>When he recovered, Owen was sent back to France to fight. Ordered to lead his troops across a canal into heavy enemy fire, he was killed in the crossing. His mother received a telegram reporting his death on Nov. 11, 1918, the day the war officially ended.
<p>Owen was no pacifist. He told his mother he had a dual mission: to lead his men "as well as an officer can" but also to watch their "sufferings that I may speak of them." Owen was right that an honorable approach to war requires both ably leading troops on the battlefield, and reporting honestly what occurs there.
<p>The Bush administration, however, is resisting this honorable approach. In its eagerness to convince Americans that things are going well in Iraq, it is leading troops into battle while trying to obscure what happens to them. President George W. Bush is not attending soldier funerals, as previous presidents have, avoiding a television image that could sow doubts in viewers' minds. He avoids mentioning America's dead - and the injured, who are seven times as numerous. The Pentagon has sent out emphatic reminders that television and photographic coverage is not allowed of coffins returning to Dover Air Force Base.
<p>Americans are already considering the relative merits of staying the course in Iraq, putting in an international peacekeeping force, and even pulling out. It is a somber debate, with great consequences for the United States and the world. We must enter into it with full information, without lapsing into what Owen trenchantly called "the old lie" - or new ones.
