<p>PARIS  - French protesters Saturday geared up for

demonstrations to coincide with a visit by President Bush while

police prepared a massive security operation.</p>

<p>Bush, who arrives in France Sunday and leaves Monday has so

far charmed German lawmakers and signed a landmark nuclear arms

reduction treaty with Russia on his European tour.</p><p>But the trip has also prompted protests by thousands of

demonstrators.</p><p>Thirty French organizations have joined for fresh

demonstrations, planning two high-profile protests on issues

ranging from a possible U.S. attack on Iraq to Washington's

polices on the Middle East, trade and the environment.</p><p>``It's not an anti-American demonstration,'' said Pierre

Tartakowsky, Secretary General of Attac, France's most

high-profile anti-globalization group which is helping organize

the protests.</p><p>``It's against policies led by Bush and his administration.

The present U.S. administration is very aggressive and very

dangerous for the future of the planet,'' he said.</p><p>On his arrival on his first official visit to France, Bush

will be whisked away in a motorcade from Paris Orly airport

under secure guard to a meeting with re-elected President

Jacques Chirac.</p><p>TENSIONS</p><p>The meeting takes place as relations between the European

Union and the United States grate over trade after Bush imposed

tariffs on U.S. steel imports and approved a farm law which

raises U.S. crop and dairy subsidies.</p><p>Bush's arrival will coincide with a protest in Caen in

Normandy, close to the U.S. Cemetery he will visit Monday to

deliver a Memorial Day speech to honor the U.S. soldiers who

died in the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany.</p><p>``I'll give a speech that will talk about sacrifice...and

lay out the sacrifices that we're going to need to do in the

future, if we expect the world to be free,'' Bush said in an

interview with French television this week.</p><p>The protest groups, who include the Green Party -- partners

in France's last leftist government -- accuse Bush of

war-mongering and say his administration is using its war on

terrorism to promote U.S. imperialism.</p><p>``We are worried that he is preparing an attack on Iraq,''

said Attac's Tartakowsky.</p><p>A demonstration, expected to be orderly, will also be held

in Paris Sunday while Bush meets Chirac at the presidential

Elysee palace. Organizers hope thousands of protesters will

turn out but they were reluctant to give firm estimates.</p><p>Police, led by a new center-right government appointed by

Chirac with a brief to crack down on crime, are taking no

chances with the demonstrations.</p><p>``There will be a lot of security,'' said a spokeswoman at

the foreign ministry, which is coordinating Bush's visit.</p>
