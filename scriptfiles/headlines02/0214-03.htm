With funding for the international fight against the global HIV/AIDS pandemic lagging, some 200 United States and foreign health and relief groups called on the US Congress Wednesday to triple the amount of assistance proposed by President George W. Bush for fiscal year 2003.

<p>In a letter sent to every member of Congress, the groups--which included such heavyweights as Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders, and some three dozen church-related agencies--said Washington should contribute at least US&#36;2.5 billion to the anti-AIDS fight overseas next year, one-quarter of the yearly amount which the United Nations estimates is the minimum necessary to contain the disease.

<p>







"Without bold investment now, projections are that 100 million people will become infected by 2007," the letter stated. "The AIDS pandemic and its related causes in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere threaten to destabilize nations and undermine global security," according to the groups.

<p>







The statement was issued as the first in a series of congressional hearings on HIV/AIDS got underway before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which also met informally with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday afternoon to hear his own appeal for increased support in the fight against AIDS.

<p>







"I think we can contain the disease, but what is required is sustained political will and the resources to do it," Annan told reporters after the meeting. He also echoed the groups' warning that the failure to contain AIDS could have political consequences. "This is not just a health issue," he said. "It is an economic and security issue."

<p>







Annan is particularly eager to gain funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria which he first proposed last April and which began operations with some US&#36;2 billion in contributions on January 1. Of that amount, the US has provided US&#36;300 million.

<p>







In addition to the US contribution for the Fund, Washington intends to spend roughly US&#36;575 million this year in bilateral anti-AIDS programs, primarily through the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The combined amount makes the United States the biggest single donor in the anti-AIDS fight.

<p>







But AIDS activists, as well as development and relief groups which deal with the impact of the disease at the grassroots, insist that the amount is far too little, given the size of the US economy compared to that of other donors, the magnitude of the destruction wrought by AIDS, and the speed with which it continues to spread in Russia, South Asia, and China, as well as Africa and the Caribbean.

<p>







"The United States, relative to the size of our economy, is giving far less to the fight than other donors," complained Paul Zeitz, co-director of the Washington-based Global AIDS Alliance. "If US&#36;10 billion a year is the minimum of what is needed, we should contribute at least 25 percent of that."

<p>







He added that so long as Washington kept its contributions low--and far below those of other donors on a per capita basis--other donors would find it politically more difficult to increase theirs.

<p>







The groups have expressed particular outrage at Bush's proposals for next year's budget: a contribution of only US&#36;200 million to the Global Fund and some US&#36;644 million in USAID and CDC programs, bringing the total to under US&#36;900 million.

<p>







In his remarks Wednesday, Annan reiterated that developing countries needed a minimum of US&#36;10 billion a year to effectively fight the disease, and, while conceding that such a goal is unlikely to be achieved immediately, called for donor nations to increase their contributions annually by at least 50 percent over the next four years in order to meet the US&#36;10 billion target by 2007.

<p>







However, in testimony Wednesday, the Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson told a skeptical Foreign Relations Committee that he considered the proposed US&#36;200 million contribution to the Fund for 2003 to be "tremendously generous under the circumstances we're facing right now," an apparent reference to the huge increases the administration has requested for the defense budget next year.

<p>







"I don't see the US&#36;200 million as an adequate contribution in light of what Kofi Annan has called for," noted Democratic Senator



Russell Feingold, who has taken a strong interest in the anti-AIDS fight. He and Committee Chairman Joseph Biden indicated that Congress was likely to add to the administration's proposal.

<p>







Illinois Senator Richard Durbin Tuesday introduced the "Global CARE Act" which, if approved would provide US&#36;2.5 billion in anti-AIDS assistance next year divided roughly equally between the Global Fund and bilateral programs.
