PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil - With his usual biting wit, noted linguist, philosopher 

and social activist Noam Chomsky gave the audience at his "teach-in", during the 

second World Social Forum (WSF) in this southern Brazilian city, a strong dose 

of exactly what they were looking for. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

professor first defended the anti-globalization movement, then neatly exposed 

the motives behind the US government's ongoing "War on Terrorism", and finally 

trashed the entire rationale the global elites give for the policies of neo-liberalism 

they push.

</table></font>"A sane and just form of globalization is what the anti-globalization movement 

is all about," Chomsky said at his Friday workshop, urging everyone at the WSF 

to "reject with scorn" the canard that they were opposed to all globalization 

per se. 

<p>

Calling the WSF - which emerged as a counterpoint to the World Economic

Forum, the annual gathering of the global corporate elites traditionally

held in Davos, Switzerland - "the most exciting development in recent

 times," Chomsky said it is a continuation of the struggle for an integrated

world of human beings that has been a part of people's and workers'

movements for more than a century.

<p>

Speaking on the main theme of his testimonial "A World Without Wars",

Chomsky said that the weapons of mass destruction in human possession could

currently wipe out the world completely.

<p>

"Either we have a world without war or we have no world," he warned,

pointing out that despite this dire threat there are developed countries,

like the United States, that are pursuing research on even more deadly ways

of destroying the world.

<p>

Chomsky traced the history of modern wars to the rise of the nation-state in

Europe several centuries ago, when rising elites used violence to demarcate

their boundaries of jurisdiction and interest.

<p>

The US government's War on Terrorism came in for a particularly strong

attack from Chomsky, who said that it is a campaign that only increases the

risks of worldwide destruction.

<p>

He questioned the US government's moral right to undertake such a war when

Washington itself is guilty of promoting and implementing terrorism

internationally on many occasions in the past.

<p>

"If one looked at the official definition of terrorism, it would be

identical to the official definition of US foreign policy," Chomsky said to

wild cheers from the audience.

<p>

The current campaign against terrorism, he pointed out, is being run by US

officials who in the mid-1980s were themselves responsible for running an

international campaign of terrorism against leftist-run countries in Latin

America and the Middle East.

<p>

In a sarcastic aside, he added that this is "a telling comment on the

educated classes of the free and democratic societies."

<p> Referring to the business and political elites who dominate global affairs 

and are meeting in the World Economic Forum this year in New York, instead of 

Davos, as the "Masters of the Universe", Chomsky said that globalization today 

was entirely designed to suit the needs of that wealthy minority. It is only popular 

movements like the WSF that can return power and resources back to the ordinary 

people and build a truly just and democratic world.
