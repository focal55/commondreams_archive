<p>PENTAGON chiefs have pinpointed a six-week "window of opportunity" in which 

to launch a war against Iraq. </span></b> 

<p>Officials are now openly briefing diplomats that they "want to light the blue 

touchpaper". 

<p>If a blitz is authorized, all the signs point to a December 16 start—with the 

"window" stretching beyond Christmas until the end of January. Cool clear weather 

and long winter nights would be ideally suited for a hi-tech bombing campaign. 

<p>Planes and troops could move under the cover of darkness, minimizing the risk 

of casualties. 

<p>The campaign would involve hundreds of jets— including British warplanes—cruise 

missiles and stealth bombers. 

<p>The Americans plan to pound Iraq for a month before launching a massive ground 

invasion from Kuwait in the south and Turkey in the north. 

<p>British and Irish diplomats based in Washington were called in last week for 

the latest update in the plans. 

<p>They will be raised in a special House of Commons debate tomorrow. 

<p>The government are also expected to call out the Territorial Army to provide 

emergency cover during the fire dispute—replacing army units currently manning 

Green Goddesses. 

<p>American special forces are secretly training more than 5,000 Iraqi rebels 

to spearhead their planned invasion. 

<p>Senior Pentagon sources have confirmed the dissidents will be ready to join 

American and British troops within the next two months. 

<p>Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has until December 8 to disclose how many weapons 

of mass destruction he has. 

<p>America is expected to immediately accuse him of lying. And an immediate attack 

would be triggered if UN weapons inspectors currently in Baghdad find Saddam has 

tried to deceive them. 

<p>The rebel army—made up of Kurdish rebels from Northern Iraq, Marsh Arabs from 

the south and military defectors from the elite Republican Guard—has been training 

in Kuwait since August. 

<p>The Kuwaiti government, which last week turned almost half its country into 

a closed-off US military base, has funded the creation of the force. 

<p>As the threat of war grew closer, British and American warplanes hit targets 

in southern Iraq for the third successive day on Friday. 

<p>The strike came after an Iraqi military jet flew into a no-fly zone monitored 

by Allied planes.
