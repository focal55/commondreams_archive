<p>The Ministry of Defense is planning a mass mobilization of key reservists beginning 

in September, heightening expectation that the United States and Britain are stepping 

up preparations for an attack on Iraq.</p>

<p class="story">British troops have also been pulled out of Nato's ACE Mobile 

Force rapid reaction corps and British involvement in a large number of exercises 

has been cancelled or scaled down to leave troops ready for the attack on Iraq.</p>

<p class="story">The Prime Minister has strongly backed the idea of a pre-emptive 

strike on Iraq and refused to commit the Government to a vote in the House of 

Commons on the deployment of British forces.</p>

<p class="story">British military planners are working on the basis that Britain 

will provide a very large force, including an armored division, a naval task force 

and substantial numbers of combat aircraft.</p>

<p class="story">The decision to pull out of the Nato rapid reaction force was 

taken at the same time as it was announced that the bulk of British forces were 

being withdrawn from Afghanistan and Bosnia.</p>

<p class="story">It means that the 1,500 British troops previously earmarked for 

the force will not now be taking part in two major exercises this autumn, in Germany 

and Ukraine.</p>

<p class="story">In another move to free forces for an attack on Iraq, 3,000 members 

of Britain's main fighting force, 1 (UK) Armored Division, have been withdrawn 

from a tank exercise in Poland. The MoD insisted that no decision had been made 

on Iraq but did not deny that planning was under way. "Any government department 

has contingency plans," a spokesman said.</p>

<p class="story">Defense sources said the reservists who would be called up would 

cover key shortages such as pilots, medical staff, special forces, intelligence 

and signals.</p>
