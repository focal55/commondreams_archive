<p>FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. - In an unprecedented mobilization in the world's oldest 

democracy, hundreds of election observers have arrived in Florida to monitor today's 

voting to prevent a repeat of the disputed counts during the 2000 presidential 

election and the gubernatorial primary in September. 

<P> Monitors from a national coalition of nonpartisan organizations, including 

the NAACP and People for the American Way Foundation, have already canvassed neighborhoods 

in dozens of Broward County precincts in south Florida, distributing voter's rights 

material in Spanish, Haitian Creole, and English. 

<P> Yesterday, frustrated observers scribbled notes as voters casting early ballots 

waited in line for three to four hours in the Broward suburb of Lauderhill. A 

day of training for some monitors in Fort Lauderdale lasted into the night. 

<P> This morning, the coalition's 1,000 observers, wearing black and white T-shirts 

and carrying cellphones, are set to stand outside polling places in six counties 

across Florida, while hundreds of lawyers wait at telephone hot lines to handle 

complaints. 

<P> The Center for Democracy, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that has monitored 

elections in developing democracies such as Guatemala and Russia, was contracted 

by Miami-Dade officials to observe voting in that county. The organization was 

paid $92,000 to send 20 people to observe election preparations, mediate between 

voters and polling officials, and evaluate the overall process. 

<P> ''What is unusual about this is that so many organizations have come together 

to do individual elements of this election protection program,'' said Ralph G. 

Neas, president of the People for the American Way Foundation. ''It is a direct 

response to the debacle in Florida'' in 2000. 

<P> The Justice Department also has sent monitors to Miami-Dade and Broward counties 

at the request of Florida's secretary of state, Jim Smith, a Republican. 

<P> In Miami-Dade, the prosecutor's office plans to send 20 teams of lawyers to 

look for voting irregularities. The county granted permission for a group of monitors 

from Eastern Europe who are affiliated with the Organization for Security and 

Cooperation in Europe, to observe the voting. 

<P> ''We are transparent; we have nothing to hide in this process,'' said Dennis 

Moss, a Miami-Dade commissioner who heads a county task force that is working 

with the Center for Democracy. ''What I hope will happen as a result of having 

all of these groups here is that they will help validate the fact that we will 

run a successful election. It will bring us credibility from our citizens, the 

community at large, and the country.'' 

<P> A coalition of 20 national organizations led by the People for the American 

Way Foundation has also mobilized nonpartisan monitors in Miami-Dade, Broward, 

Palm Beach, Orange, Leon, and Duvall counties. 

<P> Moss said each Miami-Dade precinct will have three county employees to help 

with technical issues with the new touch-screen voting machines and with voter 

registration disputes. 

<P> Not all the election observers are nonpartisan. Officials said the state expected 

a record number of Democratic and Republican observers. 

<P> ''This is unprecedented to have so many independent monitors in a local or 

national election,'' said Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, president of the American Civil 

Liberties Union of Greater Miami. 

<P> The monitors are to ensure that Florida's election reforms are followed through, 

said Rodriguez-Taseff, adding that the Justice Department will also ensure that 

balloting is executed in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole. 

<P> The ACLU led the push for outside monitors, but Rodriguez-Taseff said the 

Center for Democracy and possibly the Justice Department will have access to polling 

sites. 

<P> Sharon Lettman-Pacheco, a monitor from Florida, said the coalition's monitors 

will stand outside the polls, ready to answer voters' questions about election 

rules. 

<P> ''It's unusual that this is happening in America,'' said Lettman-Pacheco, 

deputy field director for People for the American Way Foundation. ''I cannot believe 

that we are acting like we never voted before. I have said this every day since 

the elections in 2000.'' 

<P> She said monitors will try to make sure voters have the right information 

before leaving the polls. Poll workers sometimes tell voters they cannot vote 

without identification, she said. 

<P> ''We will say, `No, all you have to do is to say who you are and sign an affidavit,''' 

Lettman-Pacheco said. ''That eases the potential of that voter not coming back 

because someone stretched out the law and said they have to have a photo identification.'' 

<P> Monitors got a preview yesterday of what lies ahead in Broward, as hundreds 

of early voters waited for hours to cast their ballots. 

<P> Lettman-Pacheco said she was frustrated to see so many people wait, but voters 

said they were happy to see Floridians, especially members of minority groups, 

coming out to vote. 

<P> ''We are happy to see such a long line,'' said Ollie Turner, who entered Lauderhill 

Mall with her husband. They said that because of the long line they would return 

on Election Day. 

<P> Marvin Ives, a music teacher who was waiting to vote at the mall, said it 

was important that Floridians exercise their right to vote despite previous election 

problems, but he was more pleased to know that so many monitors would be observing 

the process this year. 

<P> ''Given what took place in 2000, these monitors are essential,'' Ives said.</p>
