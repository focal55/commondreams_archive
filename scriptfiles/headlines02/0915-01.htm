<p>A SECRET blueprint for US global domination reveals that President Bush and 

his cabinet were planning a premeditated attack on Iraq to secure 'regime change' 

even before he took power in January 2001.

<p>The blueprint, uncovered by the Sunday Herald, for the creation of a 'global 

Pax Americana' was drawn up for Dick Cheney (now vice- president), Donald Rumsfeld 

(defense secretary), Paul Wolfowitz (Rumsfeld's deputy), George W Bush's younger 

brother Jeb and Lewis Libby (Cheney's chief of staff). The document, entitled 

Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces And Resources For A New Century, 

was written in September 2000 by the neo-conservative think-tank <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/" target="_new">Project 

for the New American Century</a> (PNAC).

<p> The plan shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf 

region whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power. It says: 'The United States 

has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. 

While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, 

the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the 

issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.'

<p>The PNAC document supports a 'blueprint for maintaining global US pre-eminence, 

precluding the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the international security 

order in line with American principles and interests'.

<p> This 'American grand strategy' must be advanced for 'as far into the future 

as possible', the report says. It also calls for the US to 'fight and decisively 

win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars' as a 'core mission'. 

<p> The report describes American armed forces abroad as 'the cavalry on the new 

American frontier'. The PNAC blueprint supports an earlier document written by 

Wolfowitz and Libby that said the US must 'discourage advanced industrial nations 

from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger regional or global 

role'.

<p>The PNAC report also:

<p> 

<ul>

<li>refers to key allies such as the UK as 'the most effective and efficient means 

of exercising American global leadership';</li>

<li>describes peace-keeping missions as 'demanding American political leadership 

rather than that of the United Nations';</li>

<li>reveals worries in the administration that Europe could rival the USA;</li>

<li>says 'even should Saddam pass from the scene' bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait 

will remain permanently -- despite domestic opposition in the Gulf regimes to 

the stationing of US troops -- as 'Iran may well prove as large a threat to US 

interests as Iraq has';</li>

<li>spotlights China for 'regime change' saying 'it is time to increase the presence 

of American forces in southeast Asia'. This, it says, may lead to 'American and 

allied power providing the spur to the process of democratization in China';</li>

<li>calls for the creation of 'US Space Forces', to dominate space, and the total 

control of cyberspace to prevent 'enemies' using the internet against the US;</li>

<li>hints that, despite threatening war against Iraq for developing weapons of 

mass destruction, the US may consider developing biological weapons -- which the 

nation has banned -- in decades to come. It says: 'New methods of attack -- electronic, 

'non-lethal', biological -- will be more widely available ... combat likely will 

take place in new dimensions, in space, cyberspace, and perhaps the world of microbes 

... advanced forms of biological warfare that can 'target' specific genotypes 

may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful 

tool';</li>

<li>and pinpoints North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran as dangerous regimes and 

says their existence justifies the creation of a 'world-wide command-and-control 

system'.</li>

</ul>

<p>Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP, father of the House of Commons and one of the leading 

rebel voices against war with Iraq, said: 'This is garbage from right-wing think-tanks 

stuffed with chicken-hawks -- men who have never seen the horror of war but are 

in love with the idea of war. Men like Cheney, who were draft-dodgers in the Vietnam 

war.

<p> 'This is a blueprint for US world domination -- a new world order of their 

making. These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control 

the world. I am appalled that a British Labour Prime Minister should have got 

into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.'
