</table></font>The voice of middle-class England was how Debbie Mainwaring described 

              herself yesterday as she stood amid the clamor of one of the biggest 

              anti-war demonstrations ever, and it was clear that she was not 

              alone. The sheer numbers who turned out to express vociferous opposition 

              to military action in Iraq &#150; between 150,000 and 350,000 on 

              the central London march &#150; meant there was no way they could 

              be dismissed as "the usual suspects" of the hard left.</p>

            <p>It took something to prompt Mrs Mainwaring and her family, from 

              Walthamstow in east London, to take to the streets. But as anxiety 

              increases over the prospect of the US launching an attack, the message 

              of the people was being driven home to President Bush and Tony Blair, 

              a man widely characterized as his unquestioning accomplice: this 

              war is wrong, and we won't stand for it.</p>

            <p>The scale of the turnout could be explained partly by the fact 

              that this was two marches in one. For the Muslim Association of 

              Britain, the issue was primarily freedom for Palestine. The Stop 

              the War Coalition's aims were self-evident, and the demonstration 

              was merely the latest in a series it has mounted since before the 

              US went into Afghanistan. But it had never drawn support like this 

              before, and the scenes along the Embankment, where the wait to get 

              moving lasted up to three hours, could be compared only with last 

              week's effort by the Countryside Alliance. September, it seems, 

              has become the marching season.</p>

            <p>"Whatever you think of rural issues, I think it's fair to say that 

              the issues at stake on this march are rather more serious," said 

              Lindsey German, the Stop the War Coalition convener. When the march 

              finally ended in a vast rally in Hyde Park, Ms German was one of 

              those who addressed the crowd, along with Tony Benn, George Galloway 

              MP, Ken Livingstone and other leading figures in the anti-war movement.</p>

            <p>But the day was only partly about people like them. It was equally 

              about the thousands who, as with the Countryside Alliance march, 

              were losing their marching virginity, and clearly feeling pretty 

              pleased about it. In their very ordinariness they added up to a 

              presence that Mr Blair might struggle to ignore.</p>

</table></font>There was no more unlikely figure to be making his marching debut 

              than Scott Ritter, the former UN weapons inspector and now scourge 

              of the Bush administration. "Never been on a march in my life," 

              he said. "But the message we have to get across is so much more 

              important than any discomfort I might feel." Mr Ritter was over 

              from his home in Albany, New York, for the Labour Party conference, 

              and then was persuaded to join the march. "All I'm trying to do 

              is uphold the principle of the rule of law. The US is engaged purely 

              in regime removal, and that is in direct contravention of the UN. 

              Their behavior is anti-democratic. I'm not sure how much impact 

              this march will make on people in the US, but if it puts pressure 

              on Blair and then he changes his attitude to Bush, then it will 

              have helped."</p>

            <p>Mrs Mainwaring, meanwhile, couldn't remember when she had last 

              been on a march. "I'm a moderate. But I heard this being dismissed 

              on the TV as a socialist thing, and I was determined to show that 

              it isn't." Kevin Waddington, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, added: "It 

              was important to show Tony Blair that he is simply not acting in 

              accordance with the views of the vast majority of people in this 

              country. The so-called evidence in his dossier is almost entirely 

              speculation.."</p>

            <p>A variety of shades of opinion were gathered, and you could argue 

              that the items on the agenda weren't all consistent with each other. 

              But the main thrust of it &#150; that many in Britain have no stomach 

              for war and are not prepared to give Mr Blair the backing he seeks 

              &#150; was undeniable. </p>

            <b class="larger"> On the march </b> 

            <p> <b>Reverend Garth Hewitt</b>, 55, vicar of All Hallows' on the 

              Wall, City of London. On the march because: "We've lost sight of 

              morality and people seem to think that violence is a solution." 

              Will be marching with a cross given to him by the Bishop of Jerusalem, 

              Riah Abu El Assael, a Palestinian Israeli citizen. "I'm marching 

              for the bishop's community as well," Rev Hewitt said, "that their 

              suffering will be stopped. I don't understand where Blair is coming 

              from. I think he's deserting his moral responsibility."</p>

            <p><b>Anas Altikriti</b>, 34, Iraqi living in London. On the march 

              because: "We refuse to be desecrated and tarnished with the blood 

              of innocent children of Palestine and Iraq. Everyone here and most 

              people in Iraq pray to see the back of Saddam Hussein, but to do 

              this with force is entirely unethical and will not achieve its aims. 

              The Iraqi people will have to bear the brunt again and be torn to 

              pieces. It's not fair for a whole country to suffer for the actions 

              of one individual."</p>

            <p><b>Sue Davis</b>, 75, retired churchworker from London. On the 

              march because: "There will be a huge conflagration in the Middle 

              East if we declare war. The focus for me is the tragic situation 

              of the ordinary people in Iraq who will be bombed and who will lose 

              any of the infrastructure they have built up since the Gulf War."</p>

            <p><b>Liz Hutchins</b>, 27, head of student CND in London. On the 

              march because: "I think this is an unjust war and people in Britain 

              have a special responsibility to speak out against it as Blair has 

              made us Bush's number one ally. I'm speaking out against our Government's 

              support for the US. This is said to be the biggest peace demonstration 

              in a decade and hopefully that will send a powerful message to Downing 

              Street. It's about humanity and speaking out for a just and fair 

              world."</p>

            <p><b>Salma Yaqoob</b>, psychotherapist and mother of two from Birmingham. 

              On the march because: Treatment she received on the streets in the 

              days following 11 September. "There was a lot of hostility towards 

              Muslims. It was the first time I'd ever experienced a racist attack. 

              A man came up to me and spat at me." Made the journey to London 

              despite being heavily pregnant. "According to UNICEF, half a million 

              Iraqi children under five had died by 1995 as a result of the war 

              and the sanctions." </p>
