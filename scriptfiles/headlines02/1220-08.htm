<p>  BERLIN   - Washington has asked Germany to provide  2,000 troops to guard U.S. bases in the country at the end of  January, a government source said on Friday.<p>



		The development coincided with mounting speculation that a  U.S.-led attack on Iraq could take place early next year.<p>



		A senior German government source told Reuters an informal  request had been made for German forces to help guard barracks  and other military installations as well as transport routes  for U.S. troops. The U.S. embassy in Berlin and the U.S.  European Command in Stuttgart declined to comment on the  request.<p>



		A defense ministry spokesman noted Chancellor Gerhard  Schroeder had already agreed to help guard bases. But he said  the government was still examining when and to what extent this  support would be needed.<p>



		"A decision can be expected at the beginning of the new  year," he said.<p>
