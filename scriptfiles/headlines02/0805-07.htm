<p>The U.S. seeks to secure "maximum coordination" with Israel in case America wages war on Iraq, messages from the U.S. administration to Jerusalem indicate.

<p> This means the U.S. will give Israel prior notice of any planned attack so that Israel can prepare the home front against Iraqi missile attacks.

<p>At the same time, the Americans expect Israel to consult with them about any response to an Iraqi attack.

<p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said in his talks with President George W. Bush and other senior officials in Washington that if Iraq attacks Israel, Israel will not just "sit and take it."

<p>The U.S. notified Sharon 60 hours before it launched the attack on Afghanistan last year, but Israel expects much longer warning before any American operation in Iraq.

<p>In the Gulf War in 1991 Iraq launched about 40 Scud missiles at Israel. The IDF had counterattack plans, but the Americans refused to let Israel partake in the war and risk the support of the Arab coalition.

<p>During his visit to the U.S. last week, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told the press that Israel is part of the camp led by President Bush. Israel will not hinder the process of ridding the world of Iraq's leader Saddam Hussein although it might suffer dearly, he said.

<p>Meanwhile, an intelligence report submitted to Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair and ministers in his cabinet indicates that Hussein intends to equip a Palestinian terror organization with biological weapons with which to attack Israeli or American targets. The report includes a full review of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, with a focus on biological warfare.

<p>American satellite images taken over the last four years provide solid evidence that since the UN weapons inspectors were driven out by Hussein in December 1998, Iraq has pursued its armament plan using mobile laboratories designed to mislead the satellites.

<p>The UN Security Council is to hold a discussion tomorrow about Iraq's letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan dated August 1, in which it agrees to reinstate the inspectors. The White House has adamantly rejected the claim, saying it was a transparent attempt to ward off an American attack.

<p>The UK Foreign Office said Hussein had "a long history of playing games." Despite these skeptic approaches, the UN was careful to avoid an all-out rejection of the Iraqi approach.</p>
