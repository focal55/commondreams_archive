<p>NEW YORK  - 

For-profit hospitals in the US

show higher death rates among their patients than non-profit

hospitals do, Canadian researchers report.

<p>The increased rate of death in for-profit hospitals is only

slight--2%--but lead author Dr. P. J. Devereaux of McMaster

University in Ontario told Reuters Health that seemingly small

number translates into a large number of patients.

<p>

The US consists of a mix of for-profit and non-profit

hospitals. In Canada, however, 95% of hospitals are non-profit,

and the country is currently debating whether to transition to

more for-profit facilities.

<p>

If Canada switched to a for-profit hospital system, that

potential increase in the death rate of 2% would translate to

2,200 more annual deaths, Devereaux said--the number of

Canadians who die from motor vehicle accidents and colon cancer

each year.

<p>

"Clearly, those are things that no one would knowingly

introduce into society," he said. The findings are published in

the May 28th issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

<p>

Devereaux and his team analyzed 15 studies that compared

26,000 private for-profit and private non-profit hospitals in

the US, which collectively treated 38 million patients between

1982 and 1995.

<p>

Privately owned hospitals are those that are not funded by

tax dollars channeled through the government. Both non-profit

and for-profit facilities can be supported by premiums from

insurance companies, but for-profit hospitals are ultimately

owned by shareholders and investors. Private non-profit

hospitals are owned by religious organizations, communities,

hospital boards or others.

<p>

While the study could not determine why there was a

difference in death rates depending on the hospital type,

Devereaux believes for-profit hospitals may cut some corners in

order to generate more revenue.

<p>

For example, Devereaux and his team found that for-profit

hospitals employ fewer highly skilled healthcare workers than

non-profit hospitals.

<p>

Devereaux stressed that the increased death rate of 2% in

for-profit hospitals is simply an average, and does not

necessarily mean that every for-profit facility has an exactly

2% higher risk of death among its patients.

<p>

However, these results indicate that those who attend

non-profit hospitals may have a slightly lower chance of dying

than others, Devereaux added.

<p>

"What people ultimately choose to do with that

(information) is their decision," he said.

<p>

As a researcher, Devereaux said he hopes policymakers in

Canada will simply use his findings to make an informed

decision on whether to introduce more for-profit hospitals in

Canada. However, as an individual, he said he hopes the country

does not make that transition.
