<p>Washington last night revealed its intention to use UN weapons inspections 

as a possible first step towards a military occupation of Iraq by sending in troops, 

sealing off "exclusion zones" and creating secure corridors throughout the country. 

<P>In a leaked proposal for a UN resolution drafted by the US with help from British 

officials, the Bush administration is seeking to transform the inspections process 

into a coercive operation. The resolution would place a full-scale invasion of 

Iraq on a hair trigger, authorizing UN member states "to use all necessary means 

to restore international peace and security" if Iraq does so much as make an omission 

in the weapons inventories it presents to the security council. 

<P>Weapons inspectors would operate out of bases inside Iraq, where they would 

be under the protection of UN troops. UN forces or the forces of a member state 

would enforce no-fly and no-drive zones around a suspected weapons site, preventing 

anything being removed before inspection. 

<P>Diplomats at the UN said there was no doubt that US troops would play a leading 

role in any such enforcement, allowing the Pentagon to deploy forces inside Iraq 

even before hostilities got under way. 

<P>The release of the draft helped Washington regain momentum in security council 

talks a day after Iraq took the initiative by agreeing to inspections under existing 

UN guidelines. That agreement was welcomed by France and Russia, but dismissed 

as empty by the US and Britain. Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, called the 

existing guidelines "defective". 

<P>The resolution will be debated over the next few days among the permanent five 

security council members. President George Bush's negotiating position was bolstered 

yesterday when the House of Representatives agreed to a war powers resolution 

handing him open-ended authority to take military action against Iraq. 

<P>The Senate, where there was tougher opposition to such a blanket authorization, 

was reported to be moving towards support of the White House line. 

<P>Under the US draft, security council member states could send their own inspectors 

into Iraq to operate alongside the official UN teams and these extra inspectors 

would have the "same rights and protections accorded other members of the team". 

Member states could also "recommend" to the UN teams which sites to search and 

how to do it. Iraqi officials could be taken out of the country, along with their 

families, for questioning, in order to remove the fear of Iraqi government reprisals. 

<P>The Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said there was no need for a new 

resolution and that the existing resolutions were good enough for inspectors to 

do their job. 

<P>John Pike, the head of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington military thinktank, 

said the resolution was worded in such a way that Iraq was almost certain to reject 

it, even if the alternative was invasion. 

<P>"I could never imagine Iraq agreeing to this. If you're going to be invaded 

you might as well make the invading force shoot their way in. It's the sort of 

proposal meant to be rejected," Mr Pike said. 

<P>British officials said the draft represented more of a discussion paper for 

the five permanent members than a formal document to be circulated within the 

full security council. British experts worked alongside their US counterparts 

at the state department in the early stages of its drafting, but it was then handed 

to the White House and the Pentagon, who added some of its tougher elements. 

<P>A Downing Street spokeswoman said: "We are not going to comment until final 

resolutions are published." 

<P>But it was clear that London was uneasy with some items in the draft, particularly 

the use of troops to quarantine suspect sites and to guard the inspectors' routes 

to the sites. One British official pointed out that it was put within square brackets 

and could be jettisoned later. 

<P>The intention behind the clause, the official said, was to avoid the situation 

under earlier inspection regimes whereby "inspectors were coming in the front 

door and kit was moving out the back." 

<P>Further anxiety about the US position came from Chris Patten, the EU's commissioner 

for external relations. In a speech in Chicago today he will say: "If the US were 

to fall prey to the temptation to act alone and outside the framework of international 

order, even for the best of motives, it would be setting off down a very dangerous 

path." 

<P>Diplomats in New York and Washington said it was clear there was a split between 

the state department and the Bush administration's hawks over how far the US should 

compromise, particularly over the threat of force. 

<P>The French have proposed an alternative resolution, which would make inspections 

tougher, but omits the authorization of military action in the event of Iraqi 

intransigence or evasion, deferring such a decision to a later resolution. 

<P><B>Resolution main points:</B>

<P><B>&#183;</B> The US (as a permanent member of the UN security council) can 

ask to be present in any inspection team and thus gain access to any part of the 

country 

<P><B>&#183;</B> The inspectors can set up bases throughout the country. They 

will be accompanied at those bases by soldiers under the UN banner sufficient 

to protect them 

<P><B>&#183;</B> The UN will have the right to declare no-fly, no-drive and exclusion 

zones, ground and air transit corridors, to be enforced either by the UN or by 

member states which could include the US 

<P><B>&#183;</B> Iraq must agree to free and unrestricted landing of aircraft, 

including unmanned spy planes 

<P><B>&#183;</B> The UN can take anyone it wishes to interview out of Iraq, along 

with his or her family 

<P><B>&#183;</B> Any false information provided by Iraq or any failure to comply 

with the resolution would automatically entitle member states to use all necessary 

means to restore international peace.</p>
