PARIS   - 

The French daily Le Monde reported on

Tuesday that the United States had broken up a huge Israeli spy

ring that may have trailed suspected al Qaeda members in the

United States without informing federal authorities.

<p>

The newspaper cited a secret U.S. government report

outlining spying activities by Israelis that it said contained

"elements (that) support the theory that Israel did not give

the U.S. all the information it had about the planning for the

September 11 attacks."

<p>

In Washington, however, U.S. law enforcement officials

discounted the report, with one calling the assertion of a spy

ring "a bogus story."

<p>

Le Monde said the secret study said the Israelis posed as

graphic arts students and tried to enter buildings belonging to

the Drug Enforcement Administration and other U.S. agencies.

<p>

Intelligence Online, a Paris-based newsletter that reported

on the study Monday, said some 120 Israeli spies had been

arrested or expelled and inquiries were continuing.

<p>

Asked by Reuters Monday about the Intelligence Online

report, an FBI spokesman flatly called it a "bogus story." The

spokesman said: "There wasn't a spy ring."

<p>

In Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Susan Dryden said of the Le Monde report, "At this

time, we have no information to support this."

<p>

U.S. officials said some Israeli students had been sent out

of the country for immigration violations, not for spying.

<p>

In Israel on Monday, a spokesman said the prime minister

had no comment on the matter.

<p>

Le Monde reported Intelligence Online's findings and added

elements it said its reporters had uncovered.

<p>

"A vast Israeli espionage network operating on American

territory has been broken up," it wrote.

<p>

The French newspaper described it as the biggest Israeli

spy case in the United States to be made public since 1986, a

reference to the life sentence given Jonathan Pollard, an

American Jew who passed U.S. military secrets to Israel.

<p>

The Pollard affair strained relations between the United

States and Israel, two traditionally close allies.

<p>

Guillaume Dasquie, editor of Intelligence Online, told

Reuters Monday the report did not specify exactly what

information the alleged agents were seeking.

<p>

"The report shows the clandestine network was engaged in

several intelligence operations. It was a long-term project,"

he said.

<p>

Le Monde said it published excerpts from the introduction

of the June 2001 report, including a comment that the women in

the spy ring were "usually very attractive."

<p>

AL QAEDA LINK?

<p>

Le Monde said more than one third of the suspected Israeli

spies had lived in Florida, where at least 10 of the 19 Arabs

involved in the Sept. 11 airplane attacks on New York's World

Trade Center and the Pentagon also lived.

<p>

At least five of the spies resided in Hollywood, Florida,

where alleged hijacker Mohammad Atta and four accomplices in

the attacks also lived, the paper said.

<p>

The United States holds Saudi-born Osama bin Laden's al

Qaeda network responsible for the September attacks.

<p>

Two Israelis lived in Fort Lauderdale, near Delray Beach,

where hijackers in the planes that crashed into the Pentagon

and in Pennsylvania resided temporarily, the report added.

<p>

"This concordance could be the source of the American view

that one of the missions of the Israeli 'students' could have

been to track al Qaeda terrorists on (U.S) territory without

informing federal authorities," Le Monde said.

<p>

The newspaper said it had seen a copy of the secret report,

and that it had learned that six suspected spies had used

portable telephones bought by a former Israeli vice consul in

the United States.

<p>

Both Le Monde and Intelligence Online said the DEA had

confirmed the existence of the report drawn up for the Justice

Department by the drug agency together with the Immigration and

Naturalization Service, the FBI and the U.S. Air Force. A

spokesman for the U.S. anti-drug agency was not immediately

available for comment.

<p>

Intelligence Online said the suspects, all between 22 and

30, had recently completed their Israeli military service and

one was related to a two-star Israeli general. It named several

of the Israelis it said had been arrested.

<p>

The inquiry began in February 2001 and is still continuing,

it quoted the report as saying.
