<p>As border tensions heighten between nuclear powers Pakistan 

  and India, a U.S. government team is in India to plan the possible evacuation 

  of 1,100 U.S. troops and up to 63,000 U.S. citizens from both countries.</p>

<p>India's foreign minister urged Pakistani President Pervez 

  Musharraf on Wednesday to honor pledges to halt terrorism in contested Kashmir 

  and warned of "the urgency of the situation."</p>

<p>The Pentagon needs no such warning.</p>

<p>About 1,000 U.S. troops are on three military bases in 

  Pakistan, and an undisclosed number of special operations forces are hunting 

  al-Qaeda leaders in the country's western provinces. In addition, about 100 

  commandos are completing a military training exercise, code-named Balance Iroquois, 

  with Indian forces in Agra, site of the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>Officials from the State Department and the military's 

  Pacific Command have begun drawing up evacuation plans for 50,000 to 60,000 

  U.S. civilians, virtually all of them in India, a Pentagon official with access 

  to the plans said Wednesday.</p>

<p>An airlift of that magnitude would dwarf the evacuations 

  of Americans from Vietnam, which Washington and U.S. forces abandoned in early 

  1975, said a military official familiar with U.S. airlift capabilities.</p>

<p>State Department officials lack specific numbers of Americans 

  in Pakistan and India. The most recent tally comes from 1999, when the department 

  reported that 4,231 citizens registered with the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and 

  15,369 with the embassy in India.</p>

<p>Few tourists or business travelers bother to contact the 

  embassies, and government employees are not included in the count.</p>

<p>On Friday, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to 

  avoid traveling to Pakistan and India and said Americans in the countries should 

  consider leaving.</p>

<p>A senior Pentagon official close to war planners said the 

  presence of U.S. troops in Pakistan and India might be deterring war. But Indian 

  Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh warned Tuesday that the presence of U.S. troops 

  "is not an inhibiting factor" as his government considers going to war.</p>

<p>India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947, including 

  two over the Kashmir province that each claims. Both have nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>The latest flare-up has stalled the hunt for al-Qaeda members, 

  Pentagon officials say. Asked what Pakistan was doing to find al-Qaeda leader 

  Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants, the senior Pentagon official replied, "Not 

  much. We're very concerned."</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, Musharraf's spokesman, said India 

  "is trying to take an unfair advantage by massing troops knowing Pakistan is 

  fully involved in fighting terrorists."</p>

<p>He said "a lot" of troops were shifted to the Indian border.</p>

<p>Withdrawing U.S. forces from Pakistan would damage the 

  continuing hunt for al-Qaeda, Pentagon officials say. There are 7,200 U.S. troops 

  in Afghanistan, but virtually all the al-Qaeda leaders are believed to be hiding 

  in Pakistan.</p>
