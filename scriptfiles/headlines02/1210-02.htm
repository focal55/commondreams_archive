<p>Former US president Jimmy Carter has warned of the potentially "catastrophic consequences" of a pre-emptive US war on Iraq.

<P>The comments came in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in Oslo.

</table></font>Mr Carter did not mention either country by name, but said: "For powerful countries to adopt a principle of preventative war may well set an example that can have catastrophic consequences."



<P>

The Bush administration has changed US  defence doctrine since the 11 September attacks to one of taking pre-emptive action before threats materialise.

<P>

 

<P>&nbsp;





But in an interview with the BBC, the former US president refused to criticise George W Bush's handling of Iraq.

<P>

"Divisive voices were calling for unilateral action," he told the BBC's Tim Sebastian.

<P>

"The government has decided that action should be multilateral. The US has taken a completely appropriate multilateral position," he said on the interview programme Hard Talk.

<P><B>Bush criticism</B>

<P>

The chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize committee caused an uproar in October <a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines02/1011-07.htm">when he said</a> granting the award to Mr Carter should be interpreted as a criticism of Mr Bush's Iraq policy.

<P>

Two other members of the committee rejected the comment by Chairman Gunnar Berge, and Mr Carter told the BBC that as far as he knew, "the Iraqi issue was not even discussed" in committee deliberations.

<P>

As president, Mr Carter helped broker the 1978 Israel-Egypt peace treaty, an accomplishment the Nobel citation described as "in itself a great enough achievement to qualify for the Nobel Peace Prize".

<P>

Since losing to Ronald Reagan in 1980, Mr Carter has worked on conflict mediation, election observation, poverty reduction and environmental issues through the Carter Center, which he founded in 1982.

<P>

He is the third US president, after Woodrow Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt, to win the Nobel prize.
