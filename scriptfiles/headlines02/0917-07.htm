The charity claims that with coffee prices now at a 30-year low, as many as 25 million people who depend on the crop for a living are being forced into poverty.

<P>

Oxfam is launching a "Coffee Rescue Plan" urging political and business leaders to take immediate action, such as destroying surplus stocks and guaranteeing a fair price for farmers. 

<P> The campaign comes a week before the <a href="http://www.ico.org/">International 

Coffee Organization</a> (ICO) is due to meet and discuss ways to solve the crisis. 

<P>

<B>Big four drinkers</B>

<P>

Oxfam is attacking what it calls the "big four" coffee companies - Kraft, Sara Lee, Procter & Gamble and Nestle - which it says buy nearly half the world's coffee crop between them.

<P>

The charity argues that the companies make huge profits while farmers receive only 5% of the retail price.

<P>

"They know there is terrible human suffering at the heart of their business and yet they do virtually nothing to help," said Oxfam's campaigns director Adrian Lovett.

<P> Oxfam wants governments and business leaders to change practices to reverse 

the current situation of supply far-exceeding demand. 

<P>

It suggests they trade only in quality coffee, pay farmers a "decent price" and back ICO attempts to rectify the problem

<P>

<B>'Stunning policy failure'</B>

<P>

Oxfam estimates 8% more coffee is produced than necessary every year, causing a slump in export prices. 

<P>

World coffee prices in New York hit an all-time  low of $0.42 per pound earlier this year, prompting sharp criticism of the contrast in retail prices. 

<P>

Oxfam claims export sales from poor countries were worth 30% of the total coffee market 10 years ago, but are now worth only 10%.

<P> The Organization is criticizing the World Bank and International Monetary 

Fund for encouraging poorer countries to expand their export business without 

warning them of potential price crashes.
