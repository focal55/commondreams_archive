<p>Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, gave his clearest warning yet yesterday that Baghdad would launch strikes against Israel if it was attacked by Britain and America.</p>

<p>Mr Aziz's threat came as he repeated his government's denial that it was developing weapons of mass destruction and said full access would be given to UN weapons inspectors.</p>

<p>His remarks followed a prediction by Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, that 

Saddam Hussein would be "making the mistake of his life" if he failed to comply 

with the latest UN resolution on disarmament. Interviewed on ITV1's <i>Jonathan 

Dimbleby</i> program, Mr Aziz said that any military action against Iraq would 

endanger not just Britain and America but also their allies such as Israel.</p>

<p>Asked what the Iraqi strategy might be if, as suspected, it is militarily weaker than it was in the 1991 Gulf War, Mr Aziz replied that his government was "capable of defending our nation". He added: "We are an old nation and we could survive. But I tell you, if the US and UK wage a war against Iraq, the consequences will be very bad to them and their friends in the region.</p>

<p>"If they don't care about their friends, then that gives you an idea about their real intentions. This is going to be devastating, not only to Iraq, but to them also. The aggressors will also suffer a great deal of losses."</p>

<p>Mr Aziz said he was not convinced the return of weapons inspectors would save Iraq from attack. "I have to be objective and honest in saying that we in Iraq do not feel that the possibility of the American aggression on Iraq has been totally removed," he said.</p>

<p>He said that since the UN weapons inspectors left in 1998, Iraq had not resumed 

any military activity in the field of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. 

"We will provide immediate access [to the inspectors]," he said. "We have given 

instructions to all responsible people and many government areas to respond immediately 

to any request to enter their sites and inspect them." Iraq would also provide 

a full declaration of its dual-use chemical, biological and nuclear programs, 

he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with Sky's <i>Sunday with Adam Boulton </i>program, Mr Straw 

said President Saddam had "one final chance", but refused to be drawn on the likelihood 

of military action.</p>

<p>"The second paragraph of the resolution talks about a 'final opportunity'. 

So he mustn't believe, because he would be making the mistake of his life, that 

he can mess the international community about yet again," Mr Straw said.</p> </p>
