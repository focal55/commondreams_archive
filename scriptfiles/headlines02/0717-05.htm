<p>BAGHDAD - President Saddam Hussein said on Wednesday in a televised speech 

marking the July 17 revolution that the United States and its allies would not 

be able to topple his government.

<p>"Temmuz (July Revolution) returns to say to all evil,  tyrants and oppressors of the world: You will never defeat me  this time. Never! Even if you come together from all over the  world, and invite all the devils as well, to stand by you,"  Saddam said.<p>Saddam, the man who has ruled Iraq with an iron fist for 23  years, seems set to fuel the war of words with his main 1991  Gulf War foe, Washington.<p>The Iraqi leader made his comments in a speech marking the  34th anniversary of the revolution which brought him to power.<p>His remarks came amid wide speculation that the United  States might use military power to oust him.<p>President Bush said last week Washington would use all  tools at its disposal to topple Saddam. He has branded Iraq  part of an "axis of evil" supporting terrorism and developing  weapons of mass destruction.<p>Iraq has repeatedly denied the U.S. charges.

<p>Iraq's parliament voted unanimously on Monday to back military preparations 

to repel any U.S. attack aimed at toppling the Iraqi government.</p>
