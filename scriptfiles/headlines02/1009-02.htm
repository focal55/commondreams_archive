<p>BAGHDAD — As the U.S. Congress prepares to vote on backing a possible war against 

Iraq, a handful of resolute Americans are doing battle here on their own front.

<P></P>

Today, a small band of volunteers from the Chicago-based anti-sanctions group 

<a href="http://www.nonviolence.org/vitw/" target="_new">Voices in the Wilderness</a> 

will gather outside the U.S. Interests section of the Polish embassy — the only 

diplomatic office Washington has in Baghdad — to donate blood at a mobile blood 

bank. 

<P></P>

"We believe in giving blood, not spilling it," says Detroit-born activist Ramzi 

Kysia. "I refuse to allow my government to use my tax dollars for a war, and commit 

violence in my name. I'm here because I can't do anything to help by sitting home 

yelling at my television set."

<P></P>

</table></font>Kysia, the spokesperson for the group's mission in Iraq, tagged the Iraq Peace 

Team, says they plan to keep 30 Americans here "indefinitely," and the numbers 

will swell to 100, regardless of an imminent war.

<P></P>

The donated blood will go to local hospitals and clinics, highlighting the plight 

of the impoverished Iraqi medical services.

<P></P>

The latest action follows in the tradition of Voices in the Wilderness, which 

began in 1996 after its anti-nuclear activist founder, Kathy Kelly, was shocked 

by the effect of sanctions on Iraqi children. Since then, the group has brought 

45 delegations to the isolated country.

<P></P>

It has won support in other Western countries for its sanctions-busting activities, 

carrying medical supplies, journals and children's toys into Iraq without U.N.-approved 

export licenses.

<P></P>

Sanctions were imposed on Iraq after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in the summer 

of 1990. They ban all imports to Iraq except for medicines and supplies identified 

as "essential civilian needs." However, even with approval the passage of medicines 

is slow, and many necessary items such as medical and sanitary equipment, electrical 

supplies and textbooks are barred. 

<P></P>

Humanitarian organizations say the result has been catastrophic, especially for 

children.

<P></P>

Hospitals lack drugs, X-ray machines and basic equipment such as dialysis machines 

for kidney diseases.

<P></P>

Water is unsafe for drinking, causing fatal diarrhea in babies.

<P></P>

Cancer patients die for lack of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

<P></P>

Dennis Halliday, former U.N. Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Iraq, resigned in protest 

in 1998 after declaring that "4,000 to 5,000 children are dying each month due 

to the impact of sanctions."

<P></P>

Voices in the Wilderness has attempted to fight the sanctions with its small but 

well-publicized aid deliveries, aimed at raising international consciousness about 

the plight of Iraqi civilians.

<P></P>

But the campaign has been a risky business for the group. 

<P></P>

In the U.S., Voices has been threatened with a $163,000 penalty, and advocates 

in Britain with prosecution. Maximum American penalties for evading sanctions 

are 12 years in jail and a $1 million (U.S.) fine.

<P></P>

Now, the group also faces anger from pro-war Americans, who have accused them 

of being tools of the Iraqi president.

<P></P>

"We're used to the accusations by now," says Kysia, 34, a stocky, bearded man 

who converted to Islam in solidarity with ordinary Muslims after the Sept. 11 

bombings sparked a backlash against the religion in the United States.

<P></P>

"Either they say we're naïve, and being used by the Iraqi regime, or we're called 

apologists."

<P></P>

But, says the former grocery store manager and child welfare counselor, "I only 

apologize for myself. I believe that Americans should understand the human consequences 

of war. That's what I'm working for." 

<P></P>

In a televised speech Monday, President George W. Bush told Americans that the 

threat posed by Saddam's weapons program is serious and growing. But he said that 

he would take "every precaution" to act with the backing of allies before beginning 

a war.

<P></P>

In Baghdad, Kysia and his colleagues from Voices in the Wilderness are hoping 

that in spite of the drive for a new war, it can still be avoided.

<P></P>

"The World Health Organization and (the U.N. children's fund) UNICEF have come 

out strongly against it," he says. 

<P></P>

"Sanctions have made the country dependent on aid from the Oil for Food Program. 

If a war begins, the program will be disrupted.

<P></P>

"Even a few weeks without those food supplies will bring thousands of people to 

the brink of starvation."

<P></P>

The program was authorized by the United Nations Security Council in 1996 after 

international protest spread over the plight of Iraq's children — largely due 

to the publicity generated by humanitarian organizations like Voices in the Wilderness.

<P></P>

The program, whose first shipments began in January, 1997, allowed the purchase 

of humanitarian supplies from limited sales of oil by the Iraqi government, under 

the supervision of the U.N.

<P></P>

Since then it has become a staple of life for many Iraqis. They now routinely 

use the coupons and supplies to sell and barter with, as well as to provide subsistence 

food for their families. Analysts have credited the program with a gradual improvement 

in living conditions.

<P></P>

"Bush says he's against weapons of mass destruction," says Kysia.

<P></P>

"But he fails to realize that launching a war against Iraq will take a massive 

toll on human life."

<P></P>

The hardening of opinion in the U.S. following the Sept. 11 bombings has made 

it easier to convince Americans that they are under threat from Iraq, Kysia admits.

<P></P>

But, he adds, "I don't believe the majority of Americans want a war. 

<P></P>

"They may have been shocked and outraged by what happened in their country, but 

they also learned a painful lesson.

<P></P>

``They don't want other people to die like that."</p>
