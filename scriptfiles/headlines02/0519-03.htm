MADRID, Spain &#150;&#150;  Some 100,000 anti-globalization demonstrators rallied peacefully through the center of Madrid on Sunday, chanting against capitalism and war and dancing to the beating of drums.<P>Organizers said nearly 200,000 protesters marched behind banners that read: "No against the exploitation of Latin America" and "Against war and the Europe of capitalism." Many chanted "Another world is possible."<P>Police placed the figure at 100,000.<P>Some Palestinian and Cuban flags could be seen as well as a reproduction of a caravel with "Colombia. State terrorism. No to the paramilitarism" written in the sail.<P>It was the last and the biggest of three demonstrations that were held over the weekend in the Spanish capital to protest European-Latin American summit, which gathered some 50 government leaders from the European Union, Central and South America and the Caribbean. The summit ended Saturday.<P>"I'm here to protest the way the first world treats the third world," said Rodolfo Martinez, a 26-year-old lawyer from Madrid. "Three-quarters of the world population are suffering from hunger and just one-quarter live like kings."<P>There were no incidents of violence reported during the nearly three-hour rally, held under tight security.<P>The rallies were called by the Social trans-Atlantic Forum, which includes some 60 to 70 social and political groups.
