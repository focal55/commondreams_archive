<p>Angry Palestinians are preparing to bury the military leader of the radical group Hamas, Sheikh Salah Shahada, and 14 other people killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza.

<P> Nine children were among those killed overnight in the missile attack on a 

residential building in a crowded neighborhood of Gaza City, Palestinian officials 

said.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon - who reportedly gave his personal approval for the air strike - expressed regret for the civilian deaths but hailed the operation as "a great success".

<P>

The attack was strongly condemned by the UN secretary general and by the European Commission, which said it was disproportionate and unjustified.

<P>

Israeli officials said the strike was a reaction to the death of dozens of Israelis in recent suicide attacks. 

<P>

Shahada was the founder of Hamas' military wing and reported to be number one on Israel's list of most wanted militants in Gaza.

</table></font>"This was an ugly crime, a massacre that no one who is sane or who has a conscience can imagine," Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said.

<P> He urged the international community to stop "these crimes against our people" 

which, he said, came at a time when there were positive initiatives for peace. 

<P> A group representing 13 Palestinian nationalist and Islamic factions called 

for a mass demonstration against Israel at the funeral on Tuesday. 

<P> The procession, it said, would pass through the ruins of the houses destroyed 

by the missile. 

<P> The children who were killed in the strike were reported to be aged between 

two months and 13 years. 

<P> About 140 people were injured in the attack, and local officials said that 

more people could be buried under the rubble. 

<P> The BBC's James Reynolds reports from Gaza City that the mood there is very 

angry, with local residents accusing Israel of deliberately targeting innocent 

civilians. 

<P> Correspondents say the Israeli operation came amid reports that Hamas was 

participating in discussions with other Palestinian factions about the possibility 

of declaring a ceasefire. 

<P> Now, Hamas warns, there will be retaliation. 

<P> "Not only will Hamas take revenge for the martyrs, all the Palestinian people 

will unite to revenge for the blood of the martyrs," Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh 

said. 

<P> <B>'Playing with fire'</B> 

<P> "This is a war crime that is aimed at destroying all efforts to return stability 

to the region," Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said. "We warned 

the Israeli Government against attacking civilians. The Israeli Government is 

playing with fire." 

<P> The European Commission said the attack, could not "be justified in any circumstance". 

<P> And the European Union's foreign policy chief warned it could hamper efforts 

to end the conflict in the Middle East. 

<P> "This extra-judicial killing operation, which targeted a densely populated 

area, comes at a time when both Israeli and Palestinians were working very seriously 

to curb violence and restore co-operative security arrangements," Javier Solana 

said. 

<P> The UK said Israel's military action was "unacceptable and counterproductive", 

while UN Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned Israel for not taking measures 

to avoid civilian causalities. 

<P> But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Gideon Meir said civilians were not 

being targeted. 

<P> "It is unfortunate that during war innocent people are being killed. Here 

the problem is that the Palestinian terrorists are hiding and using the civilian 

population as a human shield," he said. 

<P> "They are hiding behind these women and children."</p>
