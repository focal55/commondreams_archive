<p> TAJI, Iraq - Iraq showed reporters a warehouse stuffed with baby milk and 

sugar on Tuesday to repudiate a U.S. newspaper report that the building was being 

used to produce biological weapons.

<p>Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh met international  media at a warehouse in the Taji area northwest of Baghdad,  which U.S. intelligence officials quoted in the Washington  Times newspaper last week said was a biological weapons  facility.

</table></font>But instead of weapons and sophisticated labs, reporters on Tuesday found baby 

milk and sugar which had been bought under Iraq's oil-for-food deal with the United 

Nations.<span class="newsContent">"They (Americans) are checking every movement in Iraq, but  a satellite cannot tell real information," Saleh told reporters  at the site. "This is rubbish information, actually rubbish  information to convert baby milk and baby food and sugar to  weapons of mass destruction."<p>President Bush has called Iraq "an enemy until proven  otherwise," accusing Baghdad of developing weapons of mass  destruction.<p>Official U.S. policy has been to seek a "regime change,"  widely interpreted to mean the United States would like to  topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.<p>The Washington Times reported last week that a U.S.  intelligence agency spy satellite had photographed a convoy of  about 60 trucks at the building earlier in the month.<p>The Trade Ministry warehouse, which consists of three  halls, on Tuesday contained boxes of powdered milk from Yemen,  Vietnam, Tunisia and Indonesia and sacks of sugar imported from  Egypt and India under the U.N. oil-for-food programme.<p>Iraq, which has the second largest oil reserves in the  world behind Saudi Arabia, has labored under U.N. sanctions  imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. A U.S.-led coalition  expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.<p>"We started to move food from this warehouse to supply  stores in provinces early this month, and more specifically on  August 4 as we started to distribute food rations every two  months," Saleh said.<p>"We have transported 2,500 tons of powdered milk in 187  trucks and not 60 trucks as the Americans said and we will  continue (to do so)," he added.<p>"If they enlarge the satellite photographs they can compare  boxes of the baby milk moved from this site as they were not  covered and boxes here."<p>The warehouse, which was used to store meat before the 1991  Gulf War, was completely destroyed during the war. It was  recently rebuilt by a French company.</span>
