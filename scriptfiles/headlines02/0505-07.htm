<p>ROME  -   The Colosseum, ancient Rome's arena of blood and slaughter, is set to stage for the first time in its 2,000-year history a concert promoting peace and equality. The May 11 show will be dedicated in particular to the Middle East conflict, and will bring together artists from opposing sides, such as the Palestinian musician Nabil and Israeli singer Noa.</p>

<p>"There are few places in the world that are as well-known as the Colosseum, which in the past has hosted terrible crimes and atrocities," said Uri Savir, who was on the Israeli negotiating team for the Oslo peace accords and is promoting the Rome event.</p>

<p>"Now, it will become a universal symbol of peace," he said Friday.</p>

<p>Other artists due to perform include popular U.S. singer Ray Charles, Algeria's Khaled, Argentina's Mercedes Sosa, and Italian Nicola Piovani, winner of an Oscar for the soundtrack of <i>Life Is Beautiful,</i> an Italian film about the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Organizers said the event would be broadcast live to several countries, but only a few people would be able to attend the show in person.</p>

<p>In fact, the ancient, dilapidated arena can accommodate only about 400 spectators these days - a far cry from its inauguration in A.D. 80 when as many as 50,000 people crammed into the stadium for the gladiator shows.</p>

<p>The Colosseum's floor has long since disappeared, revealing a web of underground passages, and Savir did not say how the organizers would create a new stage. Two years ago, authorities set up a temporary wooden stage for an international Greek tragedy theater festival - the first show put on in the city center arena for 1,500 years.</p>
