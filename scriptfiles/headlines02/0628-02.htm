<p>OTTAWA - Protecting the planet for future generations just doesn't cut it any 

more, judging from the guest list for Earth Summit 2, the worldwide environmental 

pow-wow set for Johannesburg in August. <a href="http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/" target="_new">The 

World Summit on Sustainable Development</a> - its official name - is supposed 

to refocus international attention on the cause of sustainable development - but 

it could be a summit in name only.

<p> So far, British Prime Minister Tony Blair is the only Western leader who has 

committed to attend Earth Summit 2. Prime Minister Jean Chretien has not announced 

a decision.

<p> Most world leaders attended the original Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro a 

decade ago this month. Canada was a star as former prime minister Brian Mulroney 

championed framework treaties to protect the climate and biodiversity.

<p> Despite a series of arduous preparatory meetings for the Johannesburg summit, 

negotiators have been unable to agree even on an agenda.

<p> &quot;From the perspective of what the likely outcomes are, it's not likely 

we're going to get anything meaningful,&quot; Angela Rickman of the Sierra Club 

of Canada, said in an interview Thursday.

<p> &quot;Governments aren't willing to take stock of the progress or lack of 

progress they've made in the past 10 years. They've decided they don't want to 

make this an accountability session.&quot;

<p> Fulfilling the pledges made at Rio has proved tougher than expected.

<p> For example, the Framework Convention on Climate Change gave rise to the Kyoto 

Protocol, today the focus of a huge international battle whose outcome is unclear.

<p> Mulroney was the first world leader to sign the Convention on Biodiversity, 

but it has taken until now for Ottawa to pass legislation that puts some teeth 

in his good intentions.

<p> The UN General Assembly summed up the picture in a resolution two years ago:

<p> &quot;Despite the many successful and continuing efforts of the international 

community ... the environment and the natural resource base that support life 

on Earth continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate.&quot;

<p> Still, some diehards dismiss the pessimistic predictions.

<p> &quot;The international process has been slower than what we would have liked 

but my sense is, with some effort, this could be a very significant event,&quot; 

said Harvey Lerer, executive director of the federal government's Canadian Earth 

Summit secretariat.

<p> Canada's focus will be on the links between health and the environment and 

on strengthening the UN Environment Program, Lerer said.

<p> The federal government will propose a new initiative on sustainable cities, 

basically bringing together communities around the world to learn about best practices, 

he said.

<p> Ottawa also wants to launch a global dialogue on mining and sustainable development.

<p> Lerer said he hopes Chretien and other leaders will decide to attend: &quot;I 

think we will see commitments from world leaders accelerate as we get nearer and 

nearer to the meeting.&quot;

<p> Whatever the leaders decide, Earth Summit 2 is likely to attract a big crowd: 

the South African government says it expects more than 50,000, many of them activists 

who will attend a parallel &quot;people's summit.&quot;
