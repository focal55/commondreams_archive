International Criminal Court (ICC)--the proposed forum for trying alleged perpetrators 

of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity--moved a major step closer 

to reality this week when the government of Estonia became the 50th country to 

ratify the court's founding 1998 treaty. 

<p>Estonia's action means that only 10 more countries must ratify and deposit 

their ratifications with the United Nations before the Rome Statute for the International 

Criminal Court takes effect and the ICC comes into existence. 

<p> "This is quite a milestone," said Richard Dicker, who has been following progress 

in establishing the ICC for New York-based <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human 

Rights Watch</a>. "I think we'll have 60 before the end of June and possibly a 

good deal sooner," he added. 

<p> Europe is so far the region with the largest number of countries that have 

ratified the statute, including all but a small handful of members of the 15-nation 

European Union. A substantial number of nations in West and Southern Africa, the 

Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean have also deposited their ratifications. 

<p> The statute has been signed by 139 nations to date, and, in addition to the 

50 who have ratified it, about two dozen more are in the process of gaining ratification 

powers from their parliaments. 

<p> When the statute was first presented, only seven countries voted against it, 

including China, Israel, Iraq, and the United States. 

<p> In his last days in office, however, former President Bill Clinton--who had 

opposed it largely as a result of pressure from Republican lawmakers and the Pentagon--changed 

his mind and signed it to "reaffirm our strong support for international accountability 

and for bringing to justice perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against 

humanity." 

<p> But Clinton did not submit it to the Senate for ratification, and his successor, 

President George W. Bush, has indicated no interest in doing so. 

<p> Nonetheless, his administration has not actively lobbied other governments 

against ratification, as many ICC advocates and human rights activists had feared. 

<p> Indeed, the administration last month helped persuade Republicans in Congress 

to drop the so-called American Servicemembers Protection Act (ASPA) from the Defense 

Appropriations bill that would have barred all cooperation by local, state, or 

federal authorities with the ICC. 

<p> The ASPA also barred committing U.S. troops to peacekeeping missions unless 

they were explicitly exempted from possible prosecution by the ICC in advance. 

The act even authorized the president to use force in order to free U.S. and allied 

officials or troops if they were detained by the ICC. 

<p> Congress, however, did pass other legislation, later signed into law by Bush, 

that bans the use of government funds to cooperate with the ICC during the current 

fiscal year. 

<p> Republicans and some Democrats have opposed the ICC on the grounds that there 

are not enough safeguards in the statute to protect U.S. soldiers and officials 

from frivolous or politically-motivated prosecutions. 

<p> But advocates have argued that elaborate constraints on prosecuting powers 

were included in the statute precisely to reassure Washington about those concerns. 

Among other provisions, the ICC would only be able to take up a case after it 

had concluded that the government involved was either unable or unwilling to investigate 

or prosecute it on its own. 

<p> With the exception of Turkey, all of Washington's closest military allies 

in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have signed the statute and either 

ratified it or are actively pursuing ratification. After initially opposing it, 

Israel has also signed the statute. 

<p> Still, several significant powers, especially in Asia, have declined even 

to sign the statute. Besides China, they include Japan, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia. 

<p> ICC supporters are hoping that, as the goal of 60 ratifications gets closer, 

many countries which have been hostile or on the fence, including even the U.S., 

will come around. 

<p> "If America wants to remain a leader in pursuing international justice for 

the victims of genocide and other heinous crimes, the U.S. government must figure 

out how to work with this court, not against it," said Heather Hamilton, program 

director at the World Federalist Association, which chairs a coalition of groups 

that favors U.S. ratification.
