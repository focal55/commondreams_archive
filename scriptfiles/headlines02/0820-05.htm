<p> A women's group this week is organizing a call-in campaign to the White House 

to protest United States President George W. Bush's last-minute refusal to approve 

legislation that would have released money for relief and reconstruction efforts 

in Afghanistan, including funds for the newly created Ministry of Women's Affairs.

<p> The US&#36;134 million in Afghan humanitarian aid, which was included in the 

2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act blocked by Bush last week, would have supported 

"critical, lifesaving programs desperately needed by the citizens of Afghanistan," 

said Washington D.C.-based <a href="http://www.womensedge.org/" target="_new">Women's 

Edge</a> in a statement kicking off the campaign. 

<p> "Women, who comprise over 60 percent of the Afghan population, will continue 

to bear the brunt of this crisis," the statement said. 

<p> About US&#36;2.5 million had been earmarked for the Ministry of Women's Affairs--a 

government department created in the post-Taliban era to work towards greater 

gender equality--which planned to use the money to build women's centers in each 

of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, where health, education, and vocational programs 

were to be carried out. 

<p> Decades of civil war and Taliban policies that excluded women and girls from 

school and work have taken their toll. Afghanistan currently has the second-highest 

number of maternal deaths in the world, and female literacy is only 11 percent. 

A recent survey by the United Nations Children's Fund found that parents in the 

south of the country, where the Taliban was based, are still not allowing their 

daughters to attend school. 

<p> "The &#36;2.5 million is really a question of life or death for the Ministry 

and Afghan women," Women's Edge president Ritu Sharma told <i>OneWorld</i> Monday, 

noting that, so far, the U.S. had contributed only &#36;120,000 to the ministry. 

Other donor nations have also been slow to come through on earlier pledges. 

<p> Women's Edge is asking supporters to call the White House and express their 

"outrage" and "disappointment" over last week's decision and let the president 

know they will be closely monitoring how much money will be allocated to Afghan 

women in the future. 

<p> Bush justified his decision not to release the funds by citing growing economic 

problems in the U.S., but according to Peter Bell, the president of CARE-USA, 

a major U.S. aid agency, the &#36;134 million that Afghanistan was supposed to 

receive represents just three percent of the total spending bill. 

<p> "Disallowing the modest amount of funding for Afghanistan is penny-wise and 

pound foolish," said Bell, who added that U.S. national security would be strengthened 

by a more stable Afghanistan. 

<p> Women's Edge and CARE-USA have joined other nonprofit groups in their criticism 

of the Bush budget decision, which has also cut funding for HIV/AIDS prevention 

and treatment. Of the total &#36;5.1 billion in spending blocked by the president 

last week, about US&#36;200 million each had been designated for aid to Afghanistan 

and spending on global AIDS. 

<p> Bush pledged to support new legislation that funds "truly pressing needs" 

related to homeland security, but analysts have said that it would be difficult 

for Congress to see to new requests before adjourning prior to November elections.
