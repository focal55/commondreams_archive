<p>TORONTO, Nov. 22 /CNW/ - A high-ranking federal official may be correct in 

an assessment of US president George Bush as "a moron" say a group of Canadian 

stupidity experts. 

<p>"Technically, a moron is someone who is stupid but looks normal," said Albert 

Nerenberg, a Toronto-based film director who is completing a television documentary 

titled Stupidity. A controversy has erupted over newspaper reports that a top 

Canadian federal aide called Bush a "moron" for his hard-line stance on Iraq at 

the current NATO meeting in Prague.

<p> "Much has been said recently about Bush arriving at a point where he looks 

presidential," said Nerenberg. "What's intriguing about morons is that they can 

pass as just about anyone, but inside they're still morons." 

<p>The original term moron was coined by an American Psychologist in New Jersey 

during the early part of the century. Moron was added to the US version of the 

IQ test to screen out people who looked intelligent but weren't. A moron was considered 

to have an IQ between 50-75. 

<p>"Sadly, we may be the world's only current stupidity experts," said Shannon 

Brown, producer of Stupidity and an executive at Trailervision. "There is very 

little true research on the important subject of stupidity, and the only self-proclaimed 

expert, James Welles, a Florida-based author, was recently arrested on serious 

charges for doing something extremely stupid." 

<p>Stupidity features interviews with Noam Chomsky, John Cleese, Bill Maher and 

former Bush speechwriter David Frum, and is being commissioned by the Documentary 

Channel and the CBC. A trailer for Stupidity can be found at <a href="http://www.trailervision.com/trailer.php?id=134" target="_new">www.trailervision.com</a>
