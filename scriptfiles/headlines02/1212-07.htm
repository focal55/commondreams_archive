<p>OAKLAND -- Oakland's elected officials are drawing a line in the sand against the Bush administration's USA Patriot Act, a series of broad, far-reaching powers some fear could be used to violate residents' fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution. 

<P>

On Tuesday, the City Council will consider a resolution opposing the Patriot Act and other executive orders that expand the government's ability to obtain personal information and infiltrate religious and political organizations, under the auspices of the war against terrorism. 

<P>

Council President Ignacio De La Fuente co-sponsored the proposed resolution with Councilmember Nancy Nadel (Downtown-West Oakland). The USA Patriot Act was passed Oct. 26, 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

<P>

Though billed as something that will "unite and strengthen

America," the act has the opposite effect of creating chaos and division by pitting one group against another, De La Fuente said. 

<P>

"It will have a tremendous impact on police departments and government agencies," he said. "It will violate not only citizens' rights but anyone in the country. It will discriminate against people of color. That's what it boils down to. 

<P>

"Cities like us, with 70 percent people of color and 60 percent immigrant population, cannot stay silent on that fact," he said. "It's important that the city of Oakland, our police and our government agencies not be tainted by (the Bush administration's) attitude of discrimination, and use this as an excuse to treat people differently." 

<P>

The Oakland resolution affirms the city's "strong opposition to terrorism," but not at the expense of fundamental civil rights. 

<P>

The resolution asks that "to the extent possible, no city employee or department shall officially assist or voluntarily cooperate with investigations, interrogations or arrest procedures ... that are in violation of individuals' civil rights." 

<P>

If the resolution is approved, Oakland would become the 19th city in the United States to formally take a stand against the act and other powers awarded the executive branch and law enforcement agencies. Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Sebastopol have already passed similar resolutions. 

<P>

It is important to get other cities and municipalities on board before portions of the act come up for congressional reauthorization in two years, said Sanjeev Bery, ACLU advocate for Northern California. 

<P>

One section that will expire if not renewed expands law enforcement's authority to obtain library records; another gives the government the right to access medical, mental health, financial and educational records, and eases restrictions on telephone and Internet surveillance. 

<P>

The act and other executive orders give broad powers to designate domestic groups, including religious and political organizations, as terrorist organizations, which then makes it possible to spy on and infiltrate houses of worship, Bery said. 

<P>

Executive orders following the Sept. 11 attacks give broad authority to subject non-citizens to indefinite detention or deportation, without being charged with a crime, as happened to1,200 men of Arab or Muslim descent, Bery said. 

<P>

"I think it will make a difference if members of Congress see that their constituents oppose the crackdown. Likely they will do the same," Bery said. "Most members of Congress didn't read it when they passed it." 

<P>

The Oakland Public Library Commission also has passed a resolution opposing the act.
