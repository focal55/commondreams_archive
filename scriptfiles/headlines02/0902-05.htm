<p>JOHANNESBURG - Prime Minister Tony Blair today challenged fellow world leaders 

to summon the political will to tackle the problems of poverty and climate change.</p>

<p>He said the world faced "catastrophe" unless greenhouse gas emissions were 

curbed and repeated his claim that the poverty of Africa was a scar on the conscience 

of the world that must be healed.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's comments came in a five&#150;minute speech to the Earth 

Summit in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>He told fellow heads of state and government: "We know the problems. A child 

in Africa dies every three seconds from famine, disease or conflict.</p>

<p>"We know that if climate change is not stopped all parts of the world will 

suffer, some will even be destroyed.</p>

<p>"And we know the solution &#150; sustainable development, so the issue for 

this summit is the political will."</p>

<p>Mr Blair went on: "We know one other thing: the key characteristic of this 

world is its interdependence.</p>

<p>"Your problem becomes my problem, your country's war becomes my country's asylum 

seekers."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said the last Earth Summit in Rio "did not deliver everything, 

neither will Johannesburg, no summit can."</p>

<p>But he insisted: "This summit can and will make our world change for the better."</p>

<p>He repeated the Government's commitment to raise aid levels to &#163;1 billion 

a year, saying: "Africa for me is a passion."</p>

<p>He went on: "This summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our 

world."</p>

<p>He urged the opening up of world trade to developing countries and "sustainable 

and clean development".</p>

<p>However, negotiations over reaching an action plan have been painstaking.</p>

<p>Bleary&#150;eyed negotiators worked into the early hours today trying to hammer 

out the last details of an agreement and were upbeat after compromises were reached 

in three key areas: climate change, trade and sanitation.</p>

<p>"The process is not just about approving text. It's about working with developing 

countries that look to us for concrete action," said Undersecretary of State Paula 

Dobriansky, head of the US delegation. "Failure is not an option."</p>

<p>Diplomats said one contentious issue was resolved late on Saturday, when negotiators 

settled on wording to address the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which the 

United States has refused to sign.</p>

<p>The agreed text says nations that have ratified Kyoto "strongly urge" states 

that have not done so to ratify it in "a timely manner."</p>

<p>Negotiators also reached compromises on trade that largely stick to language 

agreed at a World Trade Organization meeting in Doha, Qatar. They include a repeat 

of commitments to hold negotiations with a view to phasing out agriculture and 

other trade&#150;distorting subsidies.</p>

<p>The last outstanding trade issue was resolved late yesterday when negotiators 

agreed to delete language giving the WTO precedence over multilateral environment 

agreements, diplomats said.</p>

<p>"There's a sense of euphoria among the delegates that they've been able to 

settle this very difficult issue," said Lucian Hudson, a spokesman for the UK 

delegation. "We're nearly there."</p>

<p>Early today, negotiators added a commitment to halve the 2 billion people living 

without sanitation by 2015, diplomats said.</p>

<p>The United States had resisted including new targets and timetables in the 

action plan, arguing the way to get results is through concrete projects &#150; 

not paper agreements.</p>

<p>Negotiators also agreed to include wording emphasizing the need for good governance 

to achieve sustainable development, but did not make it a condition for receiving 

aid as advocated by the United States, diplomats said.</p> </p>
