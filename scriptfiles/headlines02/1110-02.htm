<p>FLORENCE, Italy   - Peace activists pledged on  Sunday to stage protests across Europe against any war in Iraq,  fired by the success of a weekend rally that brought half a  million protesters onto the streets of Florence.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

</table></font>They said they were planning to hold a wave of  demonstrations in three months' time, but would mobilize  supporters sooner if a U.S. attack on Iraq looked imminent.<p>"We have fixed a date of February 15," said Italian  militant Piero Maestri at the end of the Florence meeting of  European anti-globalization groups, adding that the rallies  would be staged simultaneously in all major European capitals.<p>"Some people wanted to hold it sooner, but the English said  they needed more time to organize things. However, if war  breaks out beforehand, we will hit the streets immediately," he  said.<p>United in anti-Americanism and riled by a tough new U.N.  resolution to disarm Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, activists  from across the Continent joined forces for a carnival-like  peace rally that flooded this Renaissance art city on Saturday.<p>Some militants indicated that they would not wait until  next February before taking to the streets again, saying they  were convinced the United States had already decided to wage  war on Iraq.<p>"This war, when it comes, will be one of the most unpopular  in history and we have to do something to try to stop it," said  Alain Krivine, a far-left French member of the European  parliament who took part in Saturday's protest.<p>"Florence has shown that there is radical opposition, from  young and old people, and from all different countries."<p>The United States insists it does not want a war with Iraq  and will only attack if Saddam violates the latest U.N.  disarmament resolution.

</table>GHOST OF GENOA LAID TO REST<p>Organizers and police breathed a collective sigh of relief  on Sunday that the demonstration had passed off peaceably,  laying to rest the ghosts of the orgy of violence that  overshadowed a summit in Genoa last year.<p>In Genoa a protester was shot dead by police and hundreds  injured in running street battles, but in Florence security  forces kept a low profile and won praise from all sides.<p>"I thank with all my heart the security forces who acted  with great efficiency and professionalism," Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi said in a statement.<p>But protest organizers said that those who had warned of  the risk of violence in the run-up to the rally, including the  government, now had to eat humble pie. "The list of those who  should be apologizing is very long, starting with the prime  minister," said Alfio Nicotra, a member of Italy's Refounded  Communist Party.

<p>Saturday's march marked the climax of the first <a href="http://www.fse-esf.org/" target="_new">European 

Social Forum</a>, a four-day anti-globalization gathering modelled on the World 

Social Forum that meets in Brazil each year.

<p>The event drew tens of thousands of participants from  dozens of countries from Portugal to Russia, offering delegates  the chance to join discussion groups on topics ranging from  debt-reduction to support for the Palestinian uprising.<p>But virulent opposition to any U.S. attack on Iraq proved  the dominant theme, with anti-war slogans drowning out all  other issues at the rally.<p>"If nothing else a few more people know that war on Iraq is  wrong," said Clarence Jackson, 43, a Londoner selling copies of  Socialist Worker on the streets of Florence.<p>-- Additional reporting by Massimiliano Di Giorgio</span>
