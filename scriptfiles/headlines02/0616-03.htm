<p>WASHINGTON - The White House has been warning of another terrorist attack on the United States. Congress has been consumed with events in Afghanistan, and the State Department is trying to resolve the crisis in the Middle East.</P> 



<P>Representative James P. McGovern of Massachusetts, meanwhile, is fretting about Colombia, worried that the United States is creeping stealthily and steadily into involvement in a decades-old civil war.</P>







<P>''Pretty soon, we're going to be in up to our eyeballs,'' he said, ''and people are going to say, `How did this happen?'''</P>







<P>While much of official Washington is focused on matters in Asia and the Middle East, McGovern is part of a band of New England lawmakers who have turned their attention to Latin America.</P>







<P>The all-Democratic group, which includes Representatives William D. Delahunt and Stephen F. Lynch, both of Massachusetts, and Senators Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, are emerging as leading critics of the Bush administration's policies on Colombia, Cuba, and other Latin American nations.</P>







<P>''There's a history here. Massachusetts has always been in the forefront of human rights issues, something that I think reflects well on what we're about as a commonwealth,'' Delahunt said. ''We're still bread-and-butter Democrats.''</P>







<P>Many of the New England lawmakers have been trying to get the embargo against Cuba lifted, arguing that greater engagement would be a better way to bring democracy there. Others warn of the possible dangers of getting more involved in Colombia, where civil war has raged for 38 years. Delahunt has joined critics of the Bush administration's handling of the failed coup in Venezuela in April. Dodd has been holding hearings on Latin America, warning that ''there has been a tendency for US policy makers to neglect our closest neighbors, to be complacent that all is well in the Americas.''</P>







<P>Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, said Dodd was sometimes a lonely congressional voice questioning Reagan administration policy in Latin America during the Cold War. In the years after communism's collapse, US attention shifted from Latin America. But the Bush White House has eyed Latin America warily in its fight against global terrorism, deeming Cuba a terrorist state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, a terrorist group.</P>







<P>Facing a Republican-led House and an unyielding president, the lawmakers acknowledge that their efforts are likely to fail this year. McGovern, a Worcester Democrat, failed to defeat recent legislation increasing US aid to Colombia. Another amendment passed last month would expand the US aid to Colombia to support antiterrorist activities, as well as antinarcotics efforts.</P>







<P>''This is a Gulf of Tonkin-type of language,'' McGovern said, referring to the Johnson administration's bogus justification for escalation of the Vietnam War. ''We need to call it what it is. It is about getting involved in a nasty civil war. It has nothing to do with terrorism.''</P>







<P>But John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois and a supporter of aid to Colombia, said the change was needed ''to fight narco-terrorists. You can't just clamp down on narcotics; you have to clamp down on terrorism.''</P>







<P>The fight to lift the Cuban embargo also appears doomed in this Congress. ''The members can do whatever they want under the rules'' to try to lighten the embargo, said the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, who has used those rules to keep the proposal from floor consideration.  Even if the change is approved by Congress, ''the president will veto it,'' DeLay said.</P>







<P>Supporters of administration policy have suggested Cuba and the Colombian rebels have aided international terrorists, and Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, issued a report hinting that FARC was being trained by the Irish Republican Army.</P>







<P>Delahunt said Bush's hard-line policy on Cuba amounted to ''paying a political debt'' to Cuban exiles in South Florida, an active voting bloc in a key political state.</P>







<P>''What's happening here is that they are using the terrorist card in the same way that during the Cold War they used the anticommunist card and then the drug card,'' Birns said.</P>







<P>Delahunt, Lynch, and McGovern all have visited Cuba in recent months, infuriating foes of Cuban leader Fidel Castro who say such visitors are encouraging a communist dictator who has long been a thorn in the side of US presidents.</P>







<P>''Castro has killed literally tens of thousands of people in his own country,'' said Dennis Hays, a former foreign service officer and executive vice president of the Cuban American National Foundation. ''They go down there and shake his hands. Can you imagine doing that with [former Chilean dictator Augusto] Pinochet?''</P>







<P>Despite such sentiments, the New England lawmakers are stepping up the pressure, faithful to a long tradition among the region's representatives in Congress that goes back to the Reagan administration and the ideological battles over US support for the Contra guerrillas fighting the Sandinista leftist government in Nicaragua.</P>







<P>Delahunt of Quincy has been to Cuba, Colombia, and Venezuela on fact-finding missions, and has coaxed freshman Lynch, who represents Boston, into joining the Cuba Working Group, a congressional coalition seeking stronger ties with Cuba.</P>







<P>McGovern, a former aide to the late Representative J. Joseph Moakley, was inspired by his mentor's work in the region to work on Central American issues. Lynch, who took Moakley's seat after his death, said he feels obligated to carry on Moakley's work. Moakley was influenced by the resistance to Reagan administration policy in the region mounted by the late representatives Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and Edward Boland.</P>
