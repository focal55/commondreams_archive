<p> After weeks of debate and postponements, the Resolution Against a War in Iraq 

was voted upon and passed, 22 to 13, at last night's Michigan Student Assembly 

meeting. MSA will now work with anti-war student groups to promote dialogue and 

educational events pertaining to the war.

</table></font>It has also been resolved that MSA will urge President Bush not to preemptively 

or unilaterally start a war with Iraq and encourage the Bush administration to 

pursue a peaceful diplomatic resolution built upon international support.

<p> The assembly's last meeting of the semester saw a packed chamber with constituents 

speaking for and against the resolution. Many constituents urged the representatives 

to vote on the resolution because they said the war on Iraq affects the students 

on campus, addressing some concerns about the resolution. 

<p> "This resolution is entirely relevant. If we go to war, the money is going 

to come from us, the education budget," said LSA sophomore Matt Hollerbach, a 

member of <a href="http://www.umich.edu/%7Eantiwar/index.shtml" target="_new">Anti-War 

Action!</a>.

<p> LSA junior Mike Medow said the resolution is similar to resolutions passed 

at other universities.

<p> "We have to do this locally because they aren't hearing us on the national 

scale. That's why other universities and cities have passed anti-war resolutions," 

Medow said.

<p> Some constituents opposed to the resolution said it does not represent every 

student on campus.

<p> "Does the resolution speak for the entire student body? It's not about pro- 

or anti-war. It's about 'are we going to be able to influence Bush?'" LSA Representative 

Paul Scott said.

<p> LSA representative Pete Woiwode said MSA should be voting yes on this resolution.

<p> "We are elected to make decisions on students' behalf. This is obliviously 

a student issue because every student would be affected if a war should happen," 

Woiwode said during the debate.

<p> MSA Election Director Collin McGlashen, speaking against the resolution, said 

passing the resolution will be detrimental.

<p> "I'm afraid that people will be asking for a refund if this passes. I don't 

want this campus to feel that their student government isn't taking care of them 

as they should," McGlashen said.

<p> "In my opinion, the fact that MSA passed this resolution shows that MSA should 

focus on working on issues that directly affect students," LSA representative 

Sarra Nazem said. 

<p> MSA also elected its new chairs for various committees, only chaired by elected 

representatives, such as the Budget Priorities Committee and commissions, which 

may be chaired by students at large such as the Peace and Justice Commission.
