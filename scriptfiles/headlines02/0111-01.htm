            Pressure on the environment and growing disparities between rich and 

            poor people are threatening global stability at least as much as terrorism, 

            according to a new report released Thursday by a Washington D.C.-based 

            think-tank.

            <p> In the report, "State of the World 2002", the <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/" target="_new">Worldwatch 

              Institute</a>--which monitors global progress on issues such as 

              climate change, population, farming, and pollution--urged world 

              leaders to take stronger steps to close equality gaps as a means 

              of increasing security around the world.

            <p> According to Worldwatch President Christopher Flavin, the September 

              11 attacks on the United States were "powerful reminders that the 

              ecological instability of today's world is matched by an instability 

              in human affairs that must be urgently addressed."

            <p>United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a foreword to the 

              study, called on world leaders to recognize that "the perilous state 

              of our world is an object of genuine, urgent concern." He said they 

              must strike a more "sustainable balance between nature and the human 

              economy," when they meet in Johannesburg, South Africa, this September 

              for a major UN development summit.

            <p> Current policies such as the low priority assigned to environmental 

              issues, a decrease in foreign aid, and an increase in indebtedness 

              among developing nations are jeopardizing global stability, as poorer 

              countries are prevented from tackling problems such as the spread 

              of HIV, unsafe drinking water, unequal land distribution, and illiteracy 

              among women.

            <p> The failure of the world's nations to live up to environmental 

              promises made 10 years ago at the "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro, 

              Brazil, can be measured by the nine percent increase in global carbon 

              dioxide emissions, the 17 percent increase in damage to coral reefs, 

              and the inability of the international community to reach agreement 

              on the Kyoto Protocol - a treaty aimed at cutting the "greenhouse 

              gases" shown to fuel global warming.

            <p> To redress these trends, the report suggests a set of "sustainability 

              goals" for heads of state attending the Johannesburg development 

              summit, which has been nicknamed Rio+10.

            <p> Enforcing the Kyoto Protocol and convincing the U.S. to adopt 

              it would represent a crucial step forward, the report says. Another 

              step would be a commitment to reward farmers who avoid harmful pesticides 

              and synthetic fertilizers, and a tax or other penalty on those who 

              do not.

            <p> The report also recommends phasing out leaded gasoline, funding 

              research on safe waste-disposal methods, and ratifying three major 

              treaties aimed at reducing toxic substances.

            <p> Worldwatch urges funding increases for reproductive healthcare 

              and support of the right to education for women as antidotes to 

              unchecked population growth, one of the main factors placing pressure 

              on the Earth's natural resources.

            <p> Addressing the conflicts which erupt in poor countries with large 

              quantities of non-renewable resources, the report advises world 

              leaders to agree on certification systems discouraging illegal trade, 

              and to support stronger monitoring and enforcement by the UN.

            <p> Other recommendations include more intensive partnerships between 

              governments, civil society groups, and businesses to work towards 

              achieving urgent global goals and exerting control over tourism 

              to protect people, cultural heritage, and the environment.
