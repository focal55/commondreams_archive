WASHINGTON   - 

The Bush administration backed away

on Tuesday from a proposal to curtail a popular student loan

program, saying it would look at other ways to save money after

Democrats charged that the plan would make it more expensive

for millions of Americans to attend college.

<p>

Currently, college students can consolidate their education

loans at a low, federally subsidized, fixed interest rate.

<p>

But under a proposal outlined last week by the White House

budget office, consolidated loans would be offered at variable

rates, making them less attractive to borrowers and less costly

for the government.

<p>

Administration officials estimated the budget savings at

&#36;1.3 billion, enough to replenish the Pell Grant program for

low-income students.

<p>

But administration officials, faced with opposition from

Democrats and some Republicans, conceded the proposal was going

nowhere.

<p>

"We're looking for other ways to fund the Pell Grant

program," said one official.

<p>

Democrats had warned that doing away with fixed-rate loans

would penalize poor and middle-income students who depend on

low-interest-rate loans to pay college expenses.

<p>

"We believe strongly that our government should make it

easier for low- and middle-income students to attend college,

not harder and more costly," Sen. Edward Kennedy of

Massachusetts and 45 other Senate Democrats said in a letter to

Bush on Tuesday.

<p>

"Therefore, if this proposal is put forward, we would

strongly oppose it, and we urge your administration to withdraw

this unwise plan."</p>
