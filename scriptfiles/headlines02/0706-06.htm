- A majority of Canadians believe the country's media industry is in the hands 

of too few players and say the government should take action to deal with the 

issue, according to a poll released on Friday. 

<p>

The survey, sponsored by one of the country's largest media unions, was taken 

just days following the controversial firing of a leading newspaper publisher 

after he called for the resignation of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a friend 

of the family that controls media conglomerate CanWest Global Communications Corp. 

. 

<p>

The poll by Strategic Communications Inc. also found almost

half of those surveyed believe media owners exercise too much

control over the political opinions expressed by individual

journalists in the newspapers they write for.

<p>

"Canadians are deeply concerned about the concentration of

media ownership in this country and the effects it is having on

their news flow. They want something done about it, and they

want the federal government to do something about it," said

Peter Murdoch, a vice-president with the Communications, Energy

and Paperworkers Union of Canada.

<p>

Media ownership and editorial interference have become

hot-button issues in Canada following last month's firing of

Ottawa Citizen Publisher Russell Mills by CanWest.

<p>

CanWest is the country's largest newspaper publisher and

owner of one its three major broadcast networks.

<p>

Mills said he was fired because the Citizen published an

editorial critical of Chretien, a friend of Winnipeg's Asper

family, which controls CanWest and supports Chretien's Liberal

Party.

<p>

The firing caused an uproar and was roundly condemned by

journalists, unions and opposition legislators.

<p>

CALLS FOR BREAKUP

<p>

The Strategic poll found 74 percent of respondents agreed

with a statement that there is too much concentration of media

ownership, with players such as CanWest and Bell Globemedia,

majority owned by BCE Inc., controlling too large a portion of

newspapers, radio and television stations.

<p>

Around 72 percent of respondents agreed with a statement

that media concentration has limited the quality of information

and variety of opinion in daily newspapers.

<p>

The firing of Mills was also addressed in the poll, which

found 51 percent of those surveyed believed it was done because

the Aspers are friends and supporters of Chretien.

<p>

The poll said 66 percent of respondents agreed with a

statement that ownership concentration is a problem and the

federal government should take steps to deal with it.

<p>

Murdoch and other union officials said they would like to

see the government intervene to force media conglomerates to

divest some of their holdings. They noted some media

conglomerates are heavily indebted, and said the industry is in

flux and asset sales are likely.

<p>

Results of the polls were released at news conferences

across the country, including Vancouver, where a labor dispute

has shut down the city's two CanWest-owned daily newspapers,

the Sun and Province.

<p>

A union official said that while the poll's issues were not

directly on the bargaining table in Vancouver, the dispute

highlights CanWest's position in the city, where it also owns a

television station and most of the region's weekly newspapers.

<p>

The poll surveyed 1,000 people between June 27 and July 4.

The margin of error was 3.1 percent, 19 times out of 20.
