<p> AMMAN - Jordan has said it would not allow U.S. troops to be stationed on 

its territory to mount any attack on Iraq, its eastern neighbor and main trading 

partner.

<p>"Jordan rejects the principle of interfering in the  internal affairs of its brothers under any justification,"  Information Minister Mohammad al-Adwan told Jordan-based  foreign correspondents on Monday night.<p>"We refuse to be a launching pad or arena for any act  against our brotherly state Iraq or to use our soil and  airspace to attain this objective," Adwan said.<p>He was responding to foreign newspaper reports that  Washington already has troops in Jordanian bases as part of  secret military plans to attack Baghdad.<p>President Bush on Monday opened wide the door to possible  military action against Iraq, saying the United States would  use all tools available to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.<p>Jordan's Foreign Minister Marwan al-Muasher called in Iraqi  ambassador Sabah Yassin on Sunday to assure him the kingdom  respected Iraq's sovereignty.<p>Leading Jordanian opposition figures have voiced concerns  that Washington would pressure Jordan to use its land bases in  a wide scale military offensive against Iraq.<p>Adwan said the Jordanian monarch had warned Bush and other  world leaders in recent visits of the consequences for regional  stability of an attack on Iraq.

<p>Jordan, a major U.S. ally in the region, has been rewarded by additional economic 

and military assistance for its unequivocal support for the U.S. "war against 

terrorism" in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on U.S. cities.
