<p>Once, the streets of Cleveland and cities across the country echoed with cries 

of "Peace now!" shouted by marchers bearing such signs as "Stop the bombing" and 

"Bring the troops home." Far from the haze of gunsmoke and napalm, the scent of 

burning draft cards and civil disobedience drifted in the air. </P>

<P> Thirty years ago, as the war in Vietnam raged, all they were saying was give 

peace a chance. </P>

<P> Today, the possibility of war with Iraq has prompted plans for mass protest 

marches and rallies Saturday in Washington and San Francisco, and in a case of 

dissent deja vu, the old sentiments and slogans are surfacing again. </P>

<P> As they should, according to local veteran activists who are gearing up once 

more for action on some familiar turf. The long hair may be graying or gone, but 

the fire in the belly still burns. </P>

<P> It burns in Katie Baird of Mantua, who chaired the anti-war Cleveland Area 

Peace-Action Council from 1970 to 1972. </P>

<P> "This [possible war with Iraq] looks so much like Vietnam, it's scary," she 

said. "I get the same sense of foreboding. It's time to get back to the streets 

again." </P>

<P> During the late 1960s and early '70s, Cleveland provided several leaders for 

the national anti-war movement. </P>

<P> Those leaders included Dr. Benjamin Spock, the famed baby doctor and a professor 

at Western Reserve University; fellow WRU faculty member Sidney Peck, who co-chaired 

the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam; and Jerry Gordon. 

</P>

<P> Gordon is coordinator of the National Peace Action Coalition. </P>

<P> Gordon, now the 73-year-old chairman of the Ohio Labor Party, is organizing 

trade-union opposition to an Iraqi war, as part of what he expects will be a broader 

cross section of dissenting Americans than was seen during the Vietnam era. </P>

<P> Back then, students formed the bulk of peace demonstrators, according to Gordon. 

This time, economics will bring others into the fold, he said. </P>

<P> "The government is telling us it has no money for prescription drugs for seniors, 

or jobs, or education, but along comes a war and suddenly it has money galore," 

Gordon said. "During Vietnam, [President] Johnson talked about guns and butter. 

Here, it's guns or butter, and workers are upset." </P>

<P> To Baird, the lessons of Vietnam laid the groundwork for contemporary dissent. 

"Before I joined the anti-war movement, I was raised on Reader's Digest and the 

Bible, when no one would ever think the government would lie to us," she said. 

"Those days are gone forever." </P>

<P> Baird hopes to join Saturday's protest march in Washington, sponsored by the 

International ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) campaign and coordinated 

locally through such groups as the People's Fightback Center, formed during America's 

first war with Iraq in 1991. </P>

<P> Fightback organizer Martha Grevatt, 45, of Cleveland, remembers when her parents 

took her to protest rallies during the Vietnam War; their generation is back in 

the fray again, she said. </P>

<P> "We're getting a lot of people who really haven't been active since the Vietnam 

protest feeling compelled to get back on the streets, plus a whole new generation 

of first-protest activists," she said. </P>

<P> But those marching on Washington next weekend won't include veteran peace 

campaigner Katherine Marshall, of Rocky River. At 84, "I'm going to have to sit 

this one out," said Marshall, who was executive secretary of the University Circle 

Teach-in Committee that hosted national peace-protest planning conferences during 

the 1960s. </P>

<P> She will, however, lobby federal legislators by mail and phone, joining similar 

efforts being conducted by Cleveland Peace Action - a former anti-nuclear war 

group that nearly died with the end of the Cold War but found new life in the 

first Gulf War. </P>

<P> Francis Chiappa, president, said many of the group's 250 members are longtime 

activists, some going back to the anti-Communist hysteria of McCarthyism in the 

1940s and '50s. </P>

<P> Chiappa, 52, of Cleveland Heights, said protest of a possible war with Iraq 

differs from the Vietnam era in that "this time we have a group of activists willing 

to stand up for peace before the bullets start flying." </P>

<P> Former Vietnam War protester Bob Charlick, a Cleveland Peace Action board 

member and professor of political science at Cleveland State University, expects 

that opposition to war with Iraq will continue building and intensify if the conflict 

"turns out to be a long and bloody process." </P>

<P> Charlick, 60, of Cleveland Heights, said that although the protest movement 

will probably always represent a minority of Americans, "it's important to some 

of us who were active during the Vietnam War that our children and grandchildren 

know we're not giving up on the idea that this country can have a better foreign 

policy than this one and do not approve of attacking without provocation. </P>

<P> "As to [protesters] stopping the war, it's seriously doubtful," he added. 

"But we can raise the level of public debate, and it could become an issue in 

congressional races and maybe even the next presidential election." </P>

<P> Local peace activists don't expect an easy campaign. </P>

<P> "I remember early in the Vietnam protest when people spit at us," Baird said. 

"But eventually the anti-war sentiment became so widespread that it did, in fact, 

help end the war. It always starts small, but if you're right, it gets bigger. 

</P>

<P> "And maybe that's what we have to do now." </p>
