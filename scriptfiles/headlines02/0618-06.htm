<p>Some 7.6 million Cubans, representing more than 90 percent of the island's voting population, have signed on in support of a "populist referendum" to cement socialism into Cuba's constitution, official media announced.</p>

<p>President Fidel Castro had predicted that at least seven million of the nearly eight million Cubans above the minimum voting age of 16 would support the measure, which seeks to reinforce the "economic, political and social regime" that has been in place for 43 years in the Americas' only communist nation.</p>

<p>Some 130,000 "polling stations" opened early Saturday for the "popular referendum," as Castro termed it, and were expected to remain open until Tuesday for voters on the island of some 11.2 million to sign on to the measure.</p>

<p>"The figure surpasses all of our expectations and demonstrates the people's strong support for the revolution," Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation, declared Sunday.</p>

<p>But members of the country's illegal but tolerated dissident groups have charged that the "referendum" -- which allows only a yes vote or an abstention -- is a transparent ploy to foil Cuban aspirations to democracy.</p>

<p>"They are trying to head off the Varela Project," Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz of the opposition Cuban Human Rights Commission said on Saturday, referring to a petition bearing more than 11,000 signatures that seeks a referendum on political pluralism and market-minded economic change.</p>

<p>From Washington, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker told reporters on Friday that rather than addressing the Varela Project, "Castro has chosen to manufacture an alternative petition supporting the current constitution and to intimidate the population into signing it."</p>

<p>Once voters give their voice, the text is to be approved by the National Assembly, due to meet July 5.</p>
