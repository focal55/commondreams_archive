<p>United States and international human rights groups are calling on members 

of the United Nations Security Council to reject U.S. efforts this week to exempt 

U.S. citizens and others serving in UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) from the 

scope of the new International Criminal Court (ICC), the world's first permanent 

tribunal to prosecute war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity. 

<p> Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International have urged Security Council 

members to oppose resolutions submitted by Richard Williamson, U.S. ambassador 

to the UN for political affairs, which would accord blanket immunity from prosecution 

by the ICC for all personnel serving in the UN-approved mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 

and exempt all government officials, including soldiers, from countries which 

contribute troops to all UN-authorized or -mandated operations from being subject 

to ICC rules. 

<p> "The U.S. is trying to get at this treaty through the back door," said HRW's 

executive director Kenneth Roth. "It's using the Security Council as a battering 

ram to attack an institution that dozens of countries regard as a fait accompli." 

HRW and other rights groups consider the ICC to be potentially the most important 

human rights body to be created since the Nuremberg tribunals after World War 

II. 

<p> The Court, which will be set up in the Hague, Netherlands, early next year, 

is being created under the 1998 Rome Statute, an international treaty signed by 

almost 140 countries, that takes formal effect Monday, July 1. Despite strong 

opposition by the administration of President George W. Bush, 69 countries have 

ratified the Statute to date. 

<p> Britain and France, permanent members of the Security Council with veto powers 

and leaders in the European Union, all of whose member-states have ratified the 

ICC, have vowed to uphold the Court's integrity against Washington's efforts. 

They both played a key role last month when an earlier U.S. attempt to get its 

nationals involved in the East Timor PKO exempted from ICC jurisdiction was soundly 

rejected. 

<p> But the Bush administration has upped the ante considerably since then, with 

U.S. officials suggesting that it will withdraw all 2,500 troops and scores of 

trainers involved in UN-authorized operations in Bosnia and elsewhere or possibly 

even veto an extension of the Bosnia PKO, due to end Sunday, if it does not get 

its way. It has even been rumored that Washington will veto all future PKOs and 

extensions of current ones. 

<p> Less drastically, Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld this week hinted that Washington 

will no longer take part in any multilateral peace-related operations without 

a guarantee that its troops will be exempted from ICC jurisdiction. Meanwhile, 

some of the administration's right-wing allies in Congress have warned that they 

will withhold all U.S. contributions to UN PKOs in the future if the exemption 

is not granted. The U.S. currently pays about 27 percent of the UN's peacekeeping 

budget. 

<p> The rights groups claim that these tactics are all designed to undermine the 

ICC contrary to U.S. assurances in early May when, in an unprecedented action, 

it formally renounced former President Bill Clinton's signing of the Rome Statute, 

that it was "not going to war" against the Court. 

<p> "If the Security Council were, in effect, able to amend the ICC's jurisdiction 

simply by adopting a resolution, it would set a dangerous precedent for future 

amendments of the Rome Statute and possibly other international treaties by means 

that circumvent the process and safeguards provided in each treaty," according 

to an open letter sent by Amnesty International Thursday to all Security Council 

members. 

<p> "We believe that this is one of the most important decisions that you can 

make for the future of international justice," the London-based group said. 

<p> The Bush administration argues that the ICC lacks adequate safeguards against 

frivolous or politically-motivated prosecutions for which the U.S., with military 

personnel in more than 100 countries at any time, may be a particularly attractive 

target. 

<p> "We ought to be exempt from [this court] so that there isn't any kind of political 

harassment ...particularly when you know you're fighting the global war on terror 

and you know the terrorist training books are encouraging people to make ...charges 

[of war crimes] and allegations, and you know the press prints them instantaneously," 

Rumsfeld told international reporters earlier this week. 

<p> ICC supporters insist, however, that there are so many safeguards in ICC procedures, 

as well as in Status of Forces Agreements that are routinely negotiated with host 

countries before U.S. troops are deployed abroad, that the chances of any U.S. 

soldier being prosecuted by the ICC are extremely remote. 

<p> "The Rome Statute of the ICC already contains ample safeguards that would 

protect any United States troops against politically motivated or frivolous prosecutions," 

Amnesty said in its letter. 

<p> The stakes are very high not only for the Court and UN PKOs, but for international 

law as well, according to the rights groups. 

<p> "If the U.S. resolutions were adopted, it could force all countries that have 

ratified the Rome Statute to breach their treaty obligations" to cooperate with 

the ICC, according to William Pace, the convener of the international Coalition 

for the ICC. "This would set a disastrous precedent under which the Security Council 

could, in effect, change any treaty it wished through a Security Council resolution."
