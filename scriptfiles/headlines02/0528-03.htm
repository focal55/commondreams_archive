<p>U.S. moral authority to criticize human rights abuses abroad has been undermined by the Bush administration's failure to guarantee the rights of foreigners detained in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and its "selective adherence" to international law, Amnesty International charged in a report to be released today.</p>

<p> "In suggesting that national security may require compromises on human rights here at home, the U.S. government risks signaling its allies that 'anything goes' in their own human rights practices," Amnesty said in a summary document prepared for release with its <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport/" target="_new">2002 annual report</a>.</p>

<p> A list of "Eight Significant Human Rights Failings," compiled by the organization's U.S. branch, includes the administration's authorization of military tribunals to try alleged terrorists; selective application of Geneva Convention guarantees for prisoners held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay,  Cuba; and the indefinite detention of foreigners held without charge or access to counsel.</p>

<p> The 300-page report, which assesses human rights in 152 countries, also repeats past years' criticism of the use of the death penalty in the United States and elsewhere. It notes that 74 countries or territories had abolished the death penalty by the end of last year. An additional 15 had abolished it for all but exceptional offenses such as "wartime crimes," and 22 had abolished it in practice by not executing anyone for the past 10 years.</p>

<p> At least 3,048 persons were executed in 31 countries in 2001, Amnesty reported. The vast majority of executions -- 2,468 -- took place in China. "During the government's national 'strike hard' campaign," Amnesty said of China, "at least 1,781 people were executed between April and July 2001 -- more than the total number of people executed in the rest of the world in the previous three years."</p>

<p> After China, the three countries with the most executions were Iran (139), Saudi Arabia (79) and the United States (66).</p>

<p> The death penalty is among several items on the "Eight Failings" list that are cumulative and include charges predating the Bush administration. The report accuses the U.S. government of failing to prosecute or extradite accused torturers who it knows are traveling through or living in this country, despite an eight-year old provision in U.S. law allowing such prosecutions.</p>

<p> It also accuses the United States of continuing to export electronic, mechanical and chemical equipment manufactured for law enforcement purposes but used in other countries as implements of torture, and of imprisoning noncriminal asylum seekers here. U.S. failure to ratify key international treaties, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the administration's "unsigning" of the International Criminal Court statute this month "undermine global consensus on human rights and set dangerous precedent for other countries to 'unsign' treaties," the Amnesty summary said.</p>

<p> But the most pointed criticism concerns administration actions taken after Sept. 11. "We have certainly spoken on each of these issues at one time or another," William F. Shulz, the executive director of Amnesty International USA said in an interview, "but we've never put them together before." Shulz said the organization decided to use the occasion of its annual report release because "the U.S. government needs to recognize that its own record cannot be compromised . . . if it intends to remain a global leader on human rights."</p>

<p> An earlier Amnesty document released this spring compared post-Sept. 11 arrests by the Justice Department to the infamous "Palmer Raids" of 1920, in which thousands of immigrants were arrested for suspected subversion after a Washington bombing and about 500 were eventually deported "not for the bombing, but for their political associations."</p>

<p> With an estimated 1,200 persons detained in the first two months after Sept. 11 alone, the Justice Department has declined to release information about them. "As in the Palmer Raids," the earlier report said, "the government seems to have dispensed with developing probable cause before arresting individuals, and instead has used pretexts -- usually of routine immigration violations -- as justification for detaining hundreds of people about whom it has only the faintest suspicion."</p>

<p> Many of those detained, it said, were initially held without charges for several weeks. New regulations have increased the government's power to detain any immigrant, without a hearing or opportunity to respond to charges, who is declared a "suspected terrorist."</p>

<p> Amnesty has charged that the United States has failed to comply with international law in its detention of hundreds of foreign suspects at Guantanamo. "The cusp of the issue for us . . . is not treatment of the prisoners," Shulz said, "but the determination of their status." Since it has not declared the detainees prisoners of war, a categorization that would limit the extent to which they can be interrogated and the length of time they can be held, their status must be determined by an independent tribunal, he said.</p>

<p> Shulz said the organization expects some U.S. backlash over the report. "Amnesty is used to not being popular," he said. "There has always been some excuse for why human rights needs to take second place or even third or fourth place to other concerns. . . . Today the excuse is national security.</p>

<p> "We would say that just as support for human rights advances economic interests, so it similarly advances national security interests. That formula . . . is obviously one that has not been crystallized in policymakers' minds or in the minds of the American public."</p>
