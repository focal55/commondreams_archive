<p>ATARA, West Bank - Zaheyyeh Dahadha wept on

Wednesday as she paid her last respects to her life-long friend

Fatima Hassan, at 95 the oldest known Palestinian victim of two

years of conflict with Israel.<P> Dahadha, 82, was among hundreds of people who attended

Hassan's funeral in the West Bank village of Atara, a day after

Israeli troops shot her dead as she drove home in a taxi after

having a medical checkup and buying sweets in nearby Ramallah.<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

                  during her funeral at the town of Atara, near the West Bank 

                  City of Ramallah, December 4, 2002. Obeid was killed when Israeli

                  Palestinian witnesses and medics said. REUTERS/Osama Silwadi

</table></font>Dahadha said she had seen Hassan almost every day for more

than half a century.<P> &quot;Look at my eyes. I have not stopped crying since I heard

the bad news,&quot; she said after kissing Hassan's cheeks as the

corpse lay on a pink stretcher before the burial.<P> &quot;We used to see each other every day. She's gone now. It's

like a dream. I cannot believe what happened to her.&quot;<P> Palestinian witnesses said a soldier at the northern edge of

Ramallah smashed the windows of the taxi in which Hassan was

travelling and peppered the vehicle with bullets. The witnesses

said the taxi was waiting in a long line of vehicles.<P> The army said it was investigating the incident. Israeli

military sources said troops shot at the tyres of a Palestinian

vehicle that had been travelling on a prohibited road near

Ramallah after the driver ignored orders to halt.<P> The violence in the last two years has claimed innocent

victims on both sides, including women, children and the

elderly. At least 1,694 Palestinians and 668 Israelis have died

since the Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation began in

September 2000.<P> Relatives said Hassan had been in Ramallah for a regular

medical checkup and had bought sweets for the Muslim feast of

Eid al-Fitr which marks the end of the holy fasting month of

Ramadan.<P> Stunned women, some crying, stood in front of their houses

as men carried the coffin on their shoulders through Atara's

narrow alleyways.<P> &quot;Her death broke my heart,&quot; one woman told her neighbour.<P> Medics said Hassan was hit by a bullet in her back and two

other women in the taxi were also wounded.<P> Israel has blocked the entrances of most West Bank villages

and towns with trenches, long lines of rubble, cement blocks or

checkpoints since the start of the Palestinian uprising.<P> Israel says such measures are necessary to prevent militants

from carrying out suicide bombings and other attacks in the

Jewish state. Palestinians say the measures amount to collective

punishment.<P> Hassan was buried in the village cemetery, where wreaths and

banners lay over her grave. One banner read: &quot;A message to the

international conscience: why kill a 95-year-old woman?&quot;
