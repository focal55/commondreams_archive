Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama expressed his gratitude to India for his peoples' cause by awarding it a symbolic "Light of Truth" award and said compassion was the key to solving the problems of today's violent world.

<p>"Many of the mistakes happen because of lack of understanding of the reality. Now, I will give you one example -- violence," the Dalai Lama said, delivering an address titled "Compassion: An antidote to terrorism", at a glittering function also attended by Hollywood star and pro-Tibet activist Richard Gere.</p>

<p>"Some unhappy things happen, we pick up one cause and we think all these things happen because of this one thing and then accordingly react. Sometimes, we try to eliminate them through force but reality is not that alone, there are many other factors.</p>

<p>"Compassion is something important. Not as a religion but as an important mental factor for happiness irrespective of whether believer or non-believer, Buddhist or non-Buddhist."</p>

<p>In his address, Gere expressed gratitude to the "government of India and its people" for supporting the Tibetan cause.</p>

<p>"There is no nation or individual who has helped the Tibetan people more than India and its people," he said.</p>

<p>"My personal views of the political situation (in Tibet) are well known and they have landed me in trouble several times but I am hoping for genuine talks on the future of the Tibetan people."</p>

<p>Gere is chairman of the <a href="http://www.savetibet.org/" target="_new">International Campaign for Tibet</a>, a Washington-based body that has about 90,000 members worldwide.</p>

<p>The "Light of Truth" award was received, on behalf of the Indian people, by former speaker of the lower house of Indian parliament Rabi Ray.</p>

<p>Also present on the occasion Wednesday were former President R. Venkatraman and Defense Minister George Fernandes, who is a strong supporter of the Tibetan cause.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after an abortive uprising in 1959 and established a government-in-exile in India.</p>

<p>China, which has ruled Tibet since 1951, has been accused of trying to wipe out its Buddhist-based culture through political and religious repression and a flood of ethnic Chinese immigration.</p>

<p>Western governments, particularly the European Parliament and US Congress, have urged Beijing to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama in an effort to return him to his homeland.</p>
