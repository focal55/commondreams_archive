<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 -- United States officials said today that American spies 

had worked undercover on teams of United Nations arms inspectors ferreting out 

secret Iraqi weapons programs. 

<p> Iraq has long condemned the inspectors as tools of American intelligence. 

In October it issued a statement saying it would never cooperate with United Nations 

teams riddled with ''American spies and agents.''

<p> United States officials said American intelligence agencies provided information 

and technology to the United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom. In turn, 

they said, the United States and other nations received information on Iraqi weapons 

programs from the inspectors. 

<p> By being part of the team, the Americans gained a first-hand knowledge of 

the investigation and a protected presence inside Baghdad. 

<p> Intelligence-gathering devices supplied to the inspectors by Washington gave 

the United States a better understanding of the sites at which Iraq developed 

and concealed weapons of mass destruction, American officials said. 

<p> The commission has been a unique attempt by the United Nations to establish 

an international intelligence-gathering and analysis operation. Its mission was 

to uncover Iraqi weapons programs that continued after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 

<p> Scientists, military officers, diplomats and other professionals serve on 

the commission. The United States included some intelligence officers, using diplomatic 

cover or other professional identities, to gather intelligence independently, 

according to the officials. 

<p> American officials did not say how many spies served on the commission or 

describe their roles. 

<p> The disclosure that American spies had worked as inspectors came after The 

Boston Globe reported today that such agents had used the team as a cover to spy 

on President Saddam Hussein. 

<p> The Washington Post also reported today that the commission had worked with 

American spy agencies to gain intelligence that was used to undermine the Iraqi 

leader. 

<p> American officials also said today that a former American United Nations inspector 

was misinformed when he said the United States had taken over a United Nations 

intelligence operation in Iraq. 

<p> American officials said that while the United States had participated in the 

United Nations teams' intelligence-gathering operation, they had not taken it 

over. They strongly rejected reports that the teams had been used as a tool of 

American intelligence, as did Secretary General Kofi Annan and the commission's 

current and former chairmen. 

<p> ''We not only have no convincing evidence of these allegations,'' said Fred 

Eckhard, the spokesman for Mr. Annan, ''we have no evidence of any kind.'' 

<p> A senior Administration official said: ''Unscom does not have an indigenous 

intelligence capability; that was provided by member states. The information it 

gathered was used to help break Saddam's concealment effort, and the information 

was passed on to United Nations Security Council members.'' 

<p> In an interview, Scott Ritter, a former United States Marine intelligence 

officer, raised the question of whether the inspectors improperly aided United 

States intelligence in ways that threatened the inspectors' independence, or opened 

them up to charges of spying for Washington. 

<p> American officials said today that Mr. Ritter was describing a secret United 

States-assisted United Nations intelligence program that he did not fully understand. 

<p> Mr. Ritter said the inspectors had developed ''methodologies,'' which he refused 

to describe, that helped them understand how Iraqi security services concealed 

arms programs. The same security services and methods of concealment were also 

used to protect Mr. Hussein, he said. 

<p> Mr. Ritter said his inspection team ''had a tremendous success using these 

methodologies'' in March. A few weeks later, he said, American officials approached 

Richard Butler, an Australian who is chairman of the United Nations commission. 

<p> ''In April, the U.S. went to Butler and wanted to take over a certain portion 

of the system of how we track these weapons,'' he said. ''I wanted to make sure 

it was only for tracking weapons, but the U.S. wanted to cut me out. 

<p> ''I could no longer guarantee that the methodology would be used'' for weapons 

inspections alone, and not to benefit United States military and intelligence 

agencies, he said. 

<p> ''Butler will have to convince people that what the U.S. did was for Unscom,'' 

said Mr. Ritter. ''I think we were given assurances the information would not 

be misused,'' he said. But, he added, he believed that the United States ''used 

Butler.'' 

<p> ''I think they set him up,'' he said. 

<p> Mr. Ritter resigned in August, saying the United States and the United Nations 

had undermined the inspectors. 

<p> A Government official familiar with the dispute said Mr. Ritter was ill-informed, 

explaining that there had been a shift in the commission's intelligence-gathering 

methods last spring. 

<p> ''There was a period when Mr. Ritter was familiar with these methods,'' the 

official said. ''The methods have since gotten better, but Mr. Ritter wasn't totally 

witting of what was done.'' 

<p> And a White House official lashed out at Mr. Ritter today, saying his allegations 

had delivered a pointless propaganda victory to Iraq. 

<p> Mr. Butler said the commission had asked for more advanced technology after 

discovering in 1995 the sophisticated lies and methods of concealment that Iraq 

had used to hide its weapons programs and missile projects. 

<p> ''I want to say this with all the force that I can: We have never accepted 

or used any of that assistance for any other purpose'' than disarming Iraq, Mr. 

Butler said. 

<p> ''Have we facilitated spying?'' he said. ''Are we spies? Absolutely not.'' 

<p> Mr. Butler's predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, now Sweden's Ambassador to the United 

States, said the teams had ''exclusively devoted their activities in Iraq to identifying 

Iraq's holdings of weapons of mass destruction.'' 

<p> In an interview, Mr. Ekeus also said no eavesdropping equipment had been installed 

by the United States to spy on President Hussein or on the troops who protect 

him. Mr. Butler also denied that any such eavesdropping took place. 

<p> Monitoring the efforts of Iraq's Special Republican Guard and Special Security 

Services to conceal clandestine weapons programs might have led to Iraqi protests 

that these troops were being spied on. 

<p> The inspectors were withdrawn in December, hours before American and British 

attacks on Iraq. Mr. Hussein has said they will not be allowed to return unless 

the Special Commission is restructured and Mr. Butler is replaced. 

<p> Some United Nations diplomats and officials say Mr. Butler's position may 

be stronger now because officials have been forced to rally publicly behind him. 

<p> Mr. Annan was reported to be particularly enraged by assertions from unnamed 

sources quoted by The Washington Post who said he was suspicious of Mr. Butler 

and the commission. 

<p> Mr. Eckhard also said the Secretary General, who has sometimes been critical 

of Mr. Butler's blunt style, was not putting pressure on Mr. Butler to resign.</p>
