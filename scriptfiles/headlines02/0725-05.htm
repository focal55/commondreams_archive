<p>JERUSALEM (CNN) -- An Israeli peace group said Wednesday it had commissioned 

a poll that suggests 68 percent of Jewish settlers would obey a democratic decision 

by the Israeli government asking them to withdraw from the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>Officials from <a href="http://www.peacenow.org/" target="_new">Peace Now</a> 

said the survey shows it is possible to move settlers from the Palestinian territories 

even under current conditions. An estimated 200,000 Israeli settlers live in the 

West Bank and Gaza.</p>

<p>The survey found that 6 percent of the settlers would resist an order to withdraw 

and 2 percent would resist by all means.</p>

<p>Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza have been a major irritant to 

the Palestinians and a stumbling block to reaching a peace settlement.</p>

<p>The United States has called for a freeze on settlement activity in the Palestinian 

territories.</p>

<p>The Peace Now survey also showed that a majority, or 59 percent, of the settlers 

view financial compensation as the preferred solution.</p>

<p>Finally, the survey showed that 77 percent of the settlers chose to live in 

a settlement primarily for reasons of "quality of life."</p>

<p>Another 20 percent were there mainly for religious reasons, the survey said. 

Three percent said they chose to live in a settlement primarily because they believe 

the areas provide national security for Israel.</p>

<p>The survey results are based on a representative sample of 3,200 households 

in 127 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, the group said, as well as a control 

group of 800 Jewish Israelis living within the Green Line, the unofficial border 

that separates the West Bank and Israel. About 4,000 phone interviews were done.</p>

<p>Two polling groups conducted the survey, which was done in three waves, from 

April to July, according to Peace Now.</p>

<p>Peace Now, founded in 1978 by reserve officers and soldiers in the Israeli 

military, advocates the right of Palestinians for self-determination in a state 

alongside Israel.</p>
