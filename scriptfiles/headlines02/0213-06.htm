CARTAGENA, Colombia &#150;&#150;  The United Nations called Wednesday for tougher safeguards on the production and storage of hazardous chemicals in developing countries.<P>At an environmental conference attended by delegates from 120 countries, the U.N. Environment Program presented an 18-point strategy for preventing industrial accidents and environmental degradation as a result of the rapid shift of chemical manufacturing from industrialized to developing countries.<P>"Experts have expressed their concern ... that many developing countries lack security plans and appropriate emergency systems to confront chemical spills or accidents like the one that occurred at Bhopal, India," the U.N. agency said Wednesday.<P>A deadly gas leak at a Union Carbide Corp. plant in the Indian town killed at least 7,000 people in 1984. It was the world's worst industrial accident.<P>President Andres Pastrana, in a speech Wednesday marking the opening of the three-day conference, said governments need to back their environmental talk with action and financing.<P>"Mother nature demands more of us," he said.<P>Klaus Toepfer, who heads the U.N. agency, said the commercial and social benefits of chemicals must be weighed against the potential for harm to the environment and health.<P>The Cartagena conference is a stage-setter for the U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development next August in Johannesburg, South Africa.<P>The U.N. draft strategy would try to attract international financing to beef up poor countries' knowledge of hazardous chemicals, safe storage and emergency response.<P>The proposal also calls for nations to crack down on illegal trade in banned chemicals, prevent dumping of outlawed substances, and assess the health and environmental risks of new and existing chemicals.<P>If adopted, the plan will be submitted for approval in Johannesburg.<P>As sessions concluded Wednesday, conference chair David Anderson, who is Canada's environmental minister, said the delegates will move in the next two days from general discussion to seeking concrete agreements.<P>"There are divisions ... however I think those divisions can be bridged," he told The Associated Press.
