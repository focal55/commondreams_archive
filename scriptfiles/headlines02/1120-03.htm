<p>WASHINGTON - When Army Times writer Sean Naylor linked up with the 101st Airborne 

Division in Kandahar to cover the Afghanistan fighting, he found that instead 

of the traditional practice of being housed with the troops, reporters were ''quarantined'' 

in media tents. During USA Today reporter Andrea Stone's visits to Guantanamo, 

Cuba, she was never even allowed within shouting distance of the US-held detainees. 

And although he was traveling with US forces, San Diego Union-Tribune reporter 

James Crawley had to scan transcripts of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's Washington 

briefings to glean any hint of information about the Afghan war-related mission 

he was covering.

</table>''People on the ship wanted to talk about it,'' he said. But ''everything 

was directed from the Pentagon. What do we need to do about it next time?'' 

<P> That question was a rallying cry for the more than 100 journalists - many 

of them veterans of conflicts from Kosovo to Afghanistan - who gathered here last 

week for a conference sponsored by the two-month-old organization <a href="http://m_r_es.tripod.com/" target="_new">Military 

Reporters & Editors</a>. With a potential war in Iraq on the horizon, the answer 

they heard was not reassuring. Given Afghanistan as an object lesson, the consensus 

was that Rumsfeld's Pentagon has taken the art of information control to new heights. 

And that isn't likely to change in any battle for Baghdad. (Although keynote speaker 

Bob Woodward of the Washington Post offered the distinctly dissenting view that 

there was no more than a 50-50 chance of conflict.) 

<P> ''This Pentagon practices, regularly, lack-of-information warfare against 

the press,'' said Mark Thompson, Time magazine's national-security correspondent. 

''Longtime sources in the building that you could call up and visit, they don't 

want to be called. ... This is a much different place.'' History Channel host 

Arthur Kent - best known as NBC's ''Scud Stud'' during the 1991 Gulf War - predicted 

that in the event of another war with Iraq, ''attempts to muzzle us ... are going 

to be unprecedented.'' 

<P> The media and military's competing - if not clashing - agendas were highlighted 

in the remarks of Air Force Colonel Jay DeFrank, a Defense Department representative. 

Even as news outlets make plans to cover another war against Saddam Hussein, DeFrank 

declined to discuss such a contingency, saying that ''the president has made no 

decision about what we're going to do.'' 

<P> ''We're committed to access,'' he told the MRE gathering. ''But it's probably 

not going to be the access you want.'' 

<P> Problems with access to battlefields is a major reason why the MRE was conceived 

during a journalism confererence at the University of Maryland last spring. Actually, 

as MRE president and Seattle Post-Intelligencer staffer James Wright acknowledges, 

the organization's origins can be traced to a slightly lubricated bull session 

in a lounge ''where everyone was griping like you couldn't believe.'' 

<P> But MRE is about more than lobbying the Pentagon for a better view. It plans 

to offer training for journalists, providing them with practical advice on how 

to travel with troops, helping them understand the military culture, and advising 

them on how to win the trust of the men and women in uniform. Veteran Scripps 

Howard reporter Peter Copeland recalled how his editor once told him the way to 

achieve that last goal was to ''act like you're on your first date.'' 

<P> If many of the speakers spoke warmly of the relationship between journalists 

and rank-and-file troops, there was concern about the Pentagon's top-down strategy 

of news management. 

<P> ''There is a general sense that [information control] is just a higher priority 

with this administration,'' said USA Today military writer and MRE vice-president 

Dave Moniz. ''Even a lot of uniformed military officers are blanching at these 

restrictions.'' 

<P> Compound that with all the lethal uncertainties of a new war in Iraq, and 

the outlook isn't good for reporters. Retired Army Major General John Meyer Jr. 

said that if the war plans he had read about were accurate, ''inherently, you 

have chemical, biological, and nuclear potential on the battlefield. ... I would 

think your access will be harder to get.'' 

<P> Wall Street Journal staffer John Fialka told his colleagues that such a war 

holds out the possibility that ''we're going to have some dead bodies among us.'' 

<P> Perhaps nothing reflected the uneasy relationship between the military and 

the media more clearly than a discussion of the Pentagon ''boot camp'' training 

for journalists that began last weekend. 

<P> The physically rigorous program has been lauded by some media outlets as a 

positive step in improving the relationship between the Defense Department and 

reporters. 

<P> But juxtaposing the harsh physical demands of the boot camp with predictions 

of minimal access to any war, USA Today's Stone mused aloud, ''Maybe they're just 

trying to scare people off.''
