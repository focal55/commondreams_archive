<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->FLORENCE, Italy -- Thousands of protesters are expected to descend on a U.S. military base near the Italian city of Pisa to protest against a possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.</b></p><p>The protestors plan to march through the city to the U.S. Camp Darby on Wednesday.</p><p>A much larger anti-war march is due to take place in nearby Florence on Thursday, when more than 100,000 demonstrators are expected to take to the streets.</p><p>Shops and businesses in the city have been boarding up windows fearing acts of vandalism, and police have stepped up patrols.</p><p>The Luis Vuitton store in central Florence was completely shrouded by scaffolding and protective covering.</p>

<p>Both events are part of the five-day <a href="http://www.fse-esf.org/" target="_new">European 

Social Forum</a> organized by anti-globalization groups.</p>

<p>The gathering has been criticized by both Rome and Washington amid fears of 

potential violence from protesters.</p>

<p>However, an Italian colonel guarding the U.S. base, Salvatore Lacono, said he was not expecting trouble at Wednesday's demonstration.</p><p>"We're relaxed," he said. "The level of alert has not been upgraded and no Americans have left the base."</p><p>Established in 1952, Camp Darby served as a staging post for U.S. arms and personnel in the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
