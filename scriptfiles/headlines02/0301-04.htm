BOSTON   - 

Children are much more likely to be

murdered, commit suicide or die accidentally because of guns in

states and regions with higher levels of household firearm

ownership, according to a new study by Harvard researchers.

<p>

The study, published in The Journal of Trauma, is

significant because it shows that the mere presence of firearms

leads to more violent death among children aged 5-14, said Dr.

Matthew Miller, the lead author.

<p>

"When most people buy a gun, they do so with the

presumption that guns make them safer," Miller said in an

interview. "Our results suggest strongly that this presumption

is not warranted and that the children that parents seek to

protect with guns are instead being killed by guns."

<p>

While other studies have shown links between teen suicide

and guns, this is the first national study to examine the

connection between firearm ownership and violent death among

younger children, said Miller, associate director of Harvard's

Injury Control Research Center.

<p>

The study looked at data from all 50 states from 1988 to

1997. In that period, 6,817 children between 5 and 14 years old

died from firearms: 3,447 from homicides, 1,782 from accidental

shootings and 1,588 from suicide.

<p>

The study showed that the five states with the highest gun

ownership levels had many more firearm-related deaths among

children than the five states with the lowest levels of gun

ownership.

<p>

The two groups of states had almost the same number of

children, but in the high gun-ownership states there were 253

accidental firearm deaths compared to just 15 in the low

gun-ownership states.

<p>

There were 153 firearm suicides in the high gun-ownership

states compared to 22 in the low-ownership states and there

were 298 firearm murders in the high gun-ownership states

compared to 86 in the low-ownership states.

<p>

Meanwhile, the rates of non firearm-related suicides and

murders in the two groups of states were much closer, leading

Miller to conclude the increase in deaths was attributable to

the higher number of firearm-related deaths.

<p>

"The large difference in gun-related deaths compared with

the low level of difference in non-firearm deaths allows us to

say that guns are playing some role," Miller said.

<p>

The difference remains even when the data is controlled for

poverty, education and urbanization, the study found.

<p>

"Although no conclusions about cause and effect can be

made, this study provides compelling evidence that states with

high firearm availability are states with high childhood

firearm death rates," Dr. Therese Richmond of the University of

Pennsylvania's Firearm Injury Center wrote in an editorial.

<p>

The five states with the highest rates of gun ownership are

Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and West Virginia.

The five with the lowest are Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode

Island, New Jersey and Delaware.
