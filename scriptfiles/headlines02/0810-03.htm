</table></font>Speaking at a ceremony Friday to mark the 57th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bomb attack on his city, Mayor Itcho Ito said Washington's withdrawal from the anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia would hamper efforts to ban weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>"We are appalled by this series of unilateral actions taken by the government of the United States, actions which are also being condemned by people of sound judgment throughout the world," Ito said.</p><p>During the ceremony some 5,000 survivors, residents and foreign dignitaries stood in silence as a bell rang out and air-raid siren roared for a full minute at 11:02am. -- the exact time when the U.S. warplane released the so-called "Fat Man" bomb over the city.</p>



<p>In his address Ito also called on Japan to lead the way in developing a nuclear-weapons free zone in northeast Asia and said Tokyo should stop relying on America's "nuclear umbrella" for protection.</p><p>He said the bombing of Nagasaki must stand as the "final site" of a nuclear attack anywhere in the world.</p><p>Some 70, 000 people were killed in the Nagasaki attack on August 9, 1945.</p><p>Japan surrendered six days after the bombing, ending World War II.</p><p>In all approximately 300,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the two attacks, but advocates of the bombings say they saved many more lives on both sides by bringing a swift end to the war.</p>

</table>Ito's comments Friday reflect similar remarks from the mayor of Hiroshima earlier this week, who criticized the Bush administration for trying to, as he put it, impose a "Pax Americana" on the rest of the world.</p><p>Tadatoshi Akiba was speaking Tuesday at a ceremony to commemorate the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place four days before the attack on Nagasaki.</p><p>Condemning what critics say is America's go-it-alone stance in the wake of the September 11 attacks Akiba warned that the United States did not have the right "to decide the fate of the world."</p><p>"I strongly urge President Bush to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki... to see for himself what nuclear arms do to humankind," he added.</p>
