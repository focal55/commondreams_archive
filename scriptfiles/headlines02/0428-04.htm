<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - Leading Pentagon officials are putting the final touches on a military plan to invade Iraq, perhaps as soon as this summer, according to two senior administration officials.

<p>Reports had indicated that the Defense Department would not support an invasion until this fall or the end of the year because of troop commitments elsewhere and back orders of weaponry.</P>







<P>But the two officials said that top aides to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld would like to start the military campaign earlier, despite concerns within the State Department that an invasion would backfire by alienating the Arab world. </P>

<P>''Their druthers are not to have it a long ways off,'' one of the two sources, a Defense Department official, said yesterday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''But there are obviously complications, such as the fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians, and State is trying to convince them to hold off.''</P>

<P>The proposal, which advances  the administration discussions on Iraq over two months, is expected to be presented to President Bush in the next few weeks.</P>

<P>The debate between the Defense and State Departments on the wisdom of trying to topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein  has caused deep rifts between the departments in recent months. A broad array of Middle East issues has divided them, but Iraq has emerged by far as the single most divisive topic among the policy makers, the two officials said.</P>

<P>''The people over at the Pentagon strongly believe not only that we should do it, but that we will,'' said the other top administration source, a State Department official. ''In their minds, it's a matter of putting something in front of the president and not having him decide whether we will do it, but when.''</P>

<P>Key  aides to Rumsfeld, including the deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, and an undersecretary of defense, Douglas J. Feith, have argued forcefully that Hussein's history of stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, using chemical weapons, and trying to hide materials from United Nations weapons inspectors, prove that he is a threat to the region and to US security.</P>

<P>Several adminstration officials, including some aides to Vice President Dick Cheney, as well as prominent former officials such as R. James Woolsey, the former  director of central intelligence, have seized upon any circumstantial evidence linking Iraq and the Sept. 11 attacks as reason to attack Iraq. The only prominent known example of any such link was a meeting in Europe in April 2001 between Mohammed Atta, who led one of the jet hijackings that  led to the World Trade Center collapse, and an Iraqi intelligence agent.</P>

<P>But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and many of his top aides have argued that an attack now against Iraq would be extraordinarily poorly timed.</P>

<P>Anti-US feeling already is high in the region because of the strong US backing of Israel.</P>

<P>A US invasion of Iraq, State Department officials have said, could send already strained relationships with Arab governments into collapse.</P>

<P>Arab leaders have told US officials that domestic feeling is running very high against the US position in the Israeli-Palestinian fighting, and that an invasion of raq could trigger massive street revolts, threatening the stability of their regimes. Most European allies also have expressed opposition to an attack against Iraq.</P>

<P>The two senior officials, who both oversee facets of Middle East policy, said Bush has not been presented with any formal military options to attack Iraq. ''No decisions have been made yet,'' the State Department official said. ''But it may not be far off, and there's almost no public discussion of this.''</P>

<P>The intensive  conversations within the administration are in stark contrast to the absence of debate outside it. Congress, for instance, has been all but silent on the issue.</P>

<P>The State Department official said that in Powell's discussions over the past two months with Middle East leaders, ''We've heard from every leader the same message: `Don't do this. It's not in your best interests.' They said it's not because of oil, but because of so many complex issues and it deserves much more complex thinking.''</P>

<P>Since the Gulf War in 1991, in which President George H.W. Bush decided to withdraw coalition forces before they reached Baghdad, the United States has led an international embargo against Iraq. Those sanctions have isolated the country even further and have played a major role in the deterioration of Iraq's infrastracture, especially in health and education. </P>

<P>Jay Farrar, a former senior Defense Department official who is now director of special projects at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist Washington think tank, said that most observers believe that the current Bush administration would hold off attacking Iraq for at least several months. He cited as reasons the sporadic fighting in Afghanistan and the Israeli-Palestinian battles.</P>

<P>But he said late last week that this thinking no longer may be true. ''I think it's very much a possibility sooner rather than later,'' Farrar said. ''There are a number of reasons, some of which are rooted in what I would say is hard fact: Saddam Hussein is a bad guy, and he and his people are building bad things. A lot of this is rooted as well in wanting to go in and clean up a mess that wasn't cleaned up 11 years ago in the Gulf War.''</P>

<P>The thinking among senior Defense Department officials, Farrar said, was that if the United States ''was firm, tough, acted with resolve, especially in that area of the world, the rest of the world will come along and respect us for our toughness and won't mess with us.''</P>

<P>Farrar himself said he thinks that belief was ''too easy a calculation to make and rely on.</P>

<P>''Things never, ever go as you think they are going to go,'' Farrar said. ''The relationships will all these countries have changed from 11 years ago, and they may not be so sanguine about this. All of these actors - Saddam Hussein, Yasser Arafat, Palestinian terrorists - also could be wrapped in one big ball of wax against the administration.''</P>

<P>For now, Pentagon planners are working on logistical issues. It appears that any war against Iraq would be far different than the Gulf War, in which 500,000 ground troops from more than 20 countries were amassed in Saudi Arabia.</P>

<P>The biggest difference probably would to be in the use of so-called ''smart bombs,'' precision-guided instruments that may account for 80 percent to 90 percent of the air strikes. In the Gulf War, less than 10 percent were smart bombs.</P>

<P>Defense Department officials are exploring two main options. One would commit large numbers of ground forces for an invasion - one report, published Friday in The Washington Times, cited a plan for 200,000 ground troops.  The other would involve  a model more akin to the war in Afghanistan. There, special forces teams of 12 soldiers either joined existing armies or helped to recruit and train fighters, and then directed air strikes from the ground.</P>

<P>Any war against Iraq would rely greatly on air power. That  would mean getting neighboring countries to allow the use of air bases. Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraq in 1990,  is sure to give permission, the Defense Department official said. Turkey is less certain, but is believed to be willing, the official said. Other possible bases are in Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.</P>

<P>The stickiest situation may be in Saudi Arabia. Bush met with Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, for five hours on Thursday. While they spent much of the time on Abdullah's eight-point peace plan for the Middle East, they also discussed Iraq, officials said.</P>

<P>''They are not supportive at all'' of action against Iraq ''because of what's going on between the Israelis and Palestinians,'' the Defense Department official said. ''But when push comes to shove, they will not dare to refuse us what we need. And we can't do it without Saudi Arabia.''</P>

<P>Bush's public statements on Iraq have been  hawkish, and it's clear that he views Iraq as a potential threat to the United States.</P>

<P>''All options are on the table,'' he said recently. ''But one thing I will not allow is a nation such as Iraq to threaten our very future by developing weapons of mass destruction.''</P>
