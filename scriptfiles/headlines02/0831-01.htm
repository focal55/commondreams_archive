<p>Tens of thousands of people around the world are expected to join a Global 

Day of Action Saturday to protest the growing power of corporations and how multinational 

companies are using the ongoing United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development 

(WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa, for public-relations purposes.

</font>The protesters are also coming together to highlight the increasingly cozy 

relationship between the UN and multinational firms which, according to the activists, 

have become a growing source of partnerships, financing, and other support for 

the world body. 

<p> A recent endorsement by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) of McDonald's "World 

Children's Day," November 20, for example, has drawn scathing criticism from prominent 

public-health professionals and activists who say the fast-food giant is responsible 

for soaring rates of childhood obesity and cases of diabetes. 

<p> "What we're worried about is that many business are draping themselves in 

the blue of the United Nations in order to get themselves some brownie points 

to look good to governments, to look like they're doing the right thing around 

the world, when in fact their actual practices on the ground may be very different 

to those they profess on paper," Matt Phillipes of <a href="http://www.foe.org" target="_new">Friends 

of the Earth</a> told an interviewer from the British Broadcasting Corporation 

(BBC) at the WSSD this week. 

<p> Between 10,000 and 50,000 protesters are preparing to participate in a march 

from the township of Alexandra to the heavily-restricted WSSD site itself, three 

miles away in Sandton, where they hope to be received by UN Secretary General 

Kofi Annan. Observers are concerned that the march could result in a confrontation 

with police despite organizers' assurances that no one with any violent intent 

will be permitted to take part. 

<p> "The global people's march will be a political protest to send a clear and 

unambiguous message to our leaders that ordinary people can no longer tolerate 

the current environmentally destructive practices," said Abie Dithake, executive 

director of the <a href="http://www.sangoco.org.za/" target="_new">South African 

National NGO Coalition</a>, which is sponsoring the march. "We can no longer tolerate 

the continued neglect of the needs of the poor by our political leaders." 

<p> Demonstrators are also expected to show up at related events in Copenhagen, 

Amsterdam, Bogota, Accra, and Tokyo, among other major cities, according to Action 

for Solidarity, Equality, Environment, and Diversity (ASEED), one of the main 

sponsors of the global protest. 

<p> Corporations and their business associates have shown up at the Johannesburg 

summit in large numbers, with about 700 companies and some 50 industry chiefs 

were attending the proceedings, according to <a href="http://www.basd-action.net/" target="_new">Business 

Action for Sustainable Development</a> (BASD), an association of international 

chambers of commerce. 

<p> Civil society organizations like <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org" target="_new">Greenpeace 

International</a> have charged that the companies have received preferential access 

to both the conference site--where they have set up information booths touting 

their contributions to sustainable development--and to delegates who, as the meeting 

reaches its final stages next week, will include some 100 heads of state. 

<p> On Wednesday, BASD launched a new program to promote more investment by multinationals 

in poor countries and to press governments in developed countries to lower tariffs 

and other barriers to exports from developing countries so that they can earn 

more through trade. 

<p> "Business is pushing very hard to bring the barriers down in northern countries," 

Lord Richard Holme, a former director of Rio Tinto, a leading multinational mining 

company, told the <i>Financial Times</i> newspaper. "We are absolutely committed 

to increase access for developing countries into the developed world." 

<p> BASD is also helping showcase so-called "partnership initiatives" between 

multinationals and local governments and community groups, such as a recent campaign 

involving France's Elf Petroleum company to promote modern farming practices with 

local community groups in the impoverished but oil-rich Delta region of Nigeria 

and another partnership between Unilever and the World Wildlife Fund that certifies 

sustainable fishing practices. 

<p> But many groups charge that the companies' presence at the summit amounts 

only to "greenwash." The companies, they say, are opposed to mandatory international 

regulation of industries--such as mining, energy, and biotechnology--that environmental 

groups say are necessary to ensure compliance. Instead, the companies, to the 

extent they support any international monitoring at all, favor voluntary codes 

of conduct. 

<p> At the summit, for example, the UN will launch its "Global Reporting Initiative" 

which will call on companies that subscribe to it to report periodically on the 

environmental sustainability of their operations. Participation in the Initiative 

by companies will be entirely voluntary, however. 

<p> "Corporations are using the WSSD to portray themselves as part of the solution 

and not the problem," said a statement by ASEED issued Thursday. "The protesters 

believe that corporations are in fact incapable of being committed to social and 

environmental change."
