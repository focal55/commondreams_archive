Vice President Cheney tried to help Enron collect a $64

million debt from a giant energy project in India, government documents obtained by the

Daily News show.

<p>&quot;Good news is that the veep mentioned Enron in his meeting with [Indian opposition

leader] Sonia Gandhi yesterday,&quot; a National Security Council aide wrote in a June 28

e-mail.</p>

<p>Two other e-mails indicate that President Bush was to bring the subject up with Indian

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but the idea was scrapped before they met. </p>

<p>The documents are the latest indication that there were contacts between the Bush

administration and Enron on issues directly related to the company's business. The White

House maintains Enron enjoyed no special favors from the White House or Cheney.</p>

<p>Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans have conceded that

they spoke with Enron chief Kenneth Lay last fall about the energy giant's impending

failure, but they insist they refused to help.</p>

<p>The new documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, indicate Cheney took

a key role in pushing the Maharashtra State Electricity Board to make good on the huge

debt claimed by Enron for a power plant it built in Dabhol, India.</p>

<p>Cheney spokeswoman Mary Matalin denied yesterday that Enron officials prodded Cheney to

raise the issue with Gandhi, widow of slain Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and

daughter-in-law of assassinated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not our issue,&quot; Matalin said. &quot;It was in the briefing papers,

so he asked the question. The vice president didn't remember that topic at all. I asked

him directly.&quot;</p>

<p>White House and other top officials were interested in the Dabhol project partly

because the taxpayer-backed Overseas Private Investment Corp. provided insurance against

losses resulting from political problems in India. Overseas could face exposure as high as

$300 million.</p>

<p>The $3 billion Dabhol project was started in 1992 and built amid political wrangling in

India that included allegations of bribery. The plant eventually was completed, but it has

never been used. It involved at least 40 international finance institutions, including

Overseas, and Enron's partners included General Electric and the Bechtel Corp.</p>

<p>The e-mails indicate the State and Treasury departments also were deeply involved in

making Enron's case.</p>

<p>The highest-level contact they verify was Cheney's June 27 meeting with Gandhi,

president of the opposition Congress Party.</p>

<p>Other e-mails indicate Lay was expected in Washington around that time, but they do not

say whether he was in contact with Cheney's office.</p>

<p>Lay &#151; whom Bush used to call &quot;Kenny Boy&quot; &#151; has given more than

$600,000 to support Bush's political career.</p>

<p>Matalin said Lay and Cheney never discussed the Indian debt or Enron's financial

condition.</p>

<p>The documents obtained by The News showed that the National Security Council had given

the Overseas Private Investment Corp. high hopes that Bush would raise the issue with

Vajpayee in a Nov. 9 meeting.</p>

<p>The investment corporation had sent the White House &quot;talking points on Dabhol

prepared for the President's meeting with Prime Minister Vajpayee,&quot; according to a

Nov. 1 e-mail. </p>

<p>But a Nov. 8 e-mail, whose sender and recipient are blacked out, warned,

&quot;President Bush cannot talk about Dabhol.&quot;</p>

<p>White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, who was previously paid $50,000 a year

as an Enron adviser, also &quot;was advised that he could not discuss Dabhol.&quot;</p>

<p>National security adviser Condoleezza Rice, however, was still expected to raise the

issue &#151; but did not, another e-mail says.</p>
