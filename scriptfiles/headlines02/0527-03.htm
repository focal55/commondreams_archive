<p>WASHINGTON, May 26 — An American intelligence assessment, completed this week as tensions between India and Pakistan intensified, warns that a full-scale nuclear exchange between the two rivals could kill up to 12 million people immediately and injure up to 7 million, Pentagon officials say.</p>

<P> Even a "more limited" nuclear war — as measured in number of warheads — would have cataclysmic results, overwhelming hospitals across Asia and requiring vast foreign assistance, particularly from the United States, to battle radioactive contamination, famine and disease, officials said.</p>

<P> "The humanitarian crisis that would result would be so great that every medical facility in the Middle East and Southwest Asia would be quickly overwhelmed," one Defense Department official said. "The American military would have no choice but go in and help with the victims and to clean up."</p>

<P> American estimates of the number of warheads in the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals, and their capacity, remain classified. But Pentagon and administration officials, speaking in general terms, said Pakistan has "a couple of dozen" nuclear warheads and India "several dozen."</p>

<P> Pakistan's nuclear warheads are comparable to the Hiroshima bomb, delivering a yield below 20 kilotons, or 20,000 tons of TNT, in explosive power. They can be delivered by jet — although India maintains an air-defense system superior to Pakistan's — and by missile, Defense Department officials said. India's nuclear warheads vary in explosive power depending on whether they are intended for delivery by aircraft or by missile, but are believed to carry a yield "in the low 10's of kilotons," one Pentagon official said.</p>

<P> For the second time this weekend, Pakistan conducted a missile test today, launching a missile with a reach of 175 miles on its maiden flight. Officials said the missile was made for striking Indian troops on the border. On Saturday, Pakistan tested a missile with a range of more than 900 miles.</p>

<P> Pentagon and administration officials who discussed the new intelligence assessment said they wanted to counter any false perception that India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, were simply going through a well-rehearsed dance of threat and counterthreat.</p>

<P> "We just don't know where the `red lines' are any more," one administration official said, adding that President Bush and his senior advisers were not confident that the Indians and Pakistanis do, either.</p>

<P> Pentagon and administration officials said the analysis of Indian and Pakistani nuclear abilities, finished on Thursday, factored in current weather conditions to update casualty estimates of a nuclear exchange between the two nations.</p>

<P> Using military judgment to guess the targets and postulating that most but not all the weapons would be used, the intelligence estimated 9 million to 12 million deaths, and injuries ranging from 2 million to 7 million people, one Defense Department official said. "But those are just the immediate casualties," the official added.</p>

<P> Not included in the estimate were subsequent deaths caused by urban firestorms ignited by the heat of a nuclear exchange, or deaths from long-term radiation, or the disease and starvation expected to spread.</p>

<P> The estimate also postulated that the nuclear weapons would explode on the surface and not in the air; such "ground bursts" dig up tons of soil and spread the poisonous, radioactive debris over a large area.</p>

<P> The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an arms control research organization that tracks nuclear capacity worldwide, estimates that India maintains a nuclear arsenal of 25 to 40 nuclear weapons, compared with 15 to 20 for Pakistan. </p>

<P> The institute reports that India can deliver nuclear warheads with two types of combat aircraft, the MIG-27 and the Jaguar, and that Pakistan could arm its F-16's with nuclear bombs. India also has ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear payloads: the short-range Pritvi I, which can carry a warhead up to 155 miles, and a two-stage Agni missile, with a range of 1,500 miles.</p>

<P> Pakistan's short-range missile, tested today, is called the Hatf III, or Ghaznavi; its longer-range missile, tested Saturday, is called the Ghauri.</p>

<P> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said on Friday that officials across the Bush administration were working to "lower the temperature" between India and Pakistan. "There's no question but that they have a capability of waging a nuclear war," he said at a Pentagon news conference. "And needless to say, countries that are interested in that not happening think about those things."</p>
