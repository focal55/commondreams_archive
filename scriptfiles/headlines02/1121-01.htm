<p>WASHINGTON - A little-noticed provision in a new federal education law requires 

high schools to provide names, addresses, and phone numbers of students to military 

recruiters. Schools that refuse to comply face losing federal education funding 

under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

</table>Under the rule, part of the No Child Left Behind Act signed earlier this year, 

Pentagon recruiters are entitled to students' contact information unless parents 

opt out of sharing the data, a requirement that has alarmed civil libertarians 

and school administrators. 

<P> ''We don't wish to appear antimilitary. The military is a great first step 

out of high school for a lot of kids, and it is a fine career for some people,'' 

said Bruce Hunter, a lobbyist for the American Association of School Administrators. 

<P> Nevertheless, the association opposed the provision because it took discretion 

away from local school boards. ''We weren't happy because we're a big local control 

outfit.'' 

<P> The law also requires high schools to allow military recruiters the same campus 

access as administrators give to colleges and job recruiters. Some schools, including 

those in San Francisco and Portland, Ore., had refused military recruiters access 

to their campuses on the grounds that the Pentagon discriminated against gays 

and lesbians. 

<P> Education Secretary Rod Paige sent a letter last month to school administrators 

explaining the new regulations. Department spokesman Jim Bradshaw said the rationale 

for the rule was that the military ''felt this was needed to boost recruitment.'' 

<P> Major Sandy Troeber, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said the rules were 

''brought about by congressional support for military recruiting efforts.'' The 

Selective Service already requires men in the United States to register for the 

draft within 30 days of their 18th birthday. 

<P> But a fact sheet provided by the Pentagon said that the cost of recruiting 

had doubled in the past decade and that ''access to students can significantly 

reduce the costs of recruiting.'' 

<P> The Pentagon had been trying for years to insert the recruitment provisions 

into education legislation to counter what they saw as a lack of cooperation from 

some high schools, according to lobbyists and congressional aides. But this year 

the education bill was so loaded with other contentious issues, such as school 

vouchers, funding matters, and testing standards, that lawmakers who might have 

fought the new recruitment rules had their energies focused on other provisions. 

<P> ''It wasn't on anybody's radar. It was buried so deep in the legislation,'' 

said Kathleen Lyons, spokeswoman for the National Education Association. The group 

has only recently begun studying the issue and hasn't yet taken a position on 

it, she said. 

<P> Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts and a major negotiator 

on the Leave No Child Behind Act, had fought successfully for several years to 

keep the military recruitment rules out of education bills, but couldn't win the 

battle this year, especially since bigger education issues were dominating the 

debate, Hunter said. Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, engineered 

the inclusion of the new language, said a Kennedy staffer. 

<P> ''All this provision does is provide military recruiters with the same access 

to directory information that colleges currently enjoy,'' Kennedy said in a statement. 

<P> Civil libertarians are concerned about the rule nonetheless. 

<P> ''We opposed it primarily on privacy grounds, that students or parents should 

be able to control access to directory information, such as names, addresses, 

ages,'' said Christopher Anders, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties 

Union. ''That information shouldn't be sent out to military recruiters unless 

parents want it sent out.'' 

<P> Under federal privacy laws, schools generally must have written permission 

from parents or students to release any information about a student's education 

record, according to the Education Department. Exceptions include handing records 

over to a transfer school, to law enforcement in some cases, and to officials 

who need the information in cases of health or safety emergencies. 

<P> Schools may release what is called ''directory information,'' such as names, 

addresses, phone numbers, and date and place of birth, but they must also give 

parents the option of refusing disclosure of their child's information. Schools 

can decide on their own whether to provide the directory information to outside 

individuals or organizations. 

<P> The difference under the new rule is that schools will not have the discretion 

to refuse to provide such information to the military; they must provide the information 

to recruiters and allow them on campus at the Pentagon's request. 

<P> Groups such as the American Friends Service Committee and the Central Committee 

for Conscientious Objectors, an antimilitary draft organization, have been fielding 

complaints about the new rules, but are not sure whether they can successfully 

challenge them, especially in the environment created by the Sept. 11, 2001, terror 

attacks. Analysts are looking at whether the rules violate existing privacy law, 

said Oscar Castro, an AFSC official. 

<P> Jill Wynns, president of the San Francisco Board of Education, said the board's 

attorneys are looking at the law to see whether the Bay Area school system can 

keep any part of its current written policy, which prohibits military recruiters 

from coming on campus and bars the release of any student information to military 

recruiters ''or anyone who asks for it.'' 

<P> ''We are very upfront about being biased in favor of higher education. We're 

telling our kids, `go to college, go to college,''' said Wynns, adding that schools 

do not allow businesses to recruit on campuses, either. The military has not yet 

asked for students' contact information, but recruiters have demanded and recently 

been given access to San Francisco high schools for the first time in 12 years, 

she said.
