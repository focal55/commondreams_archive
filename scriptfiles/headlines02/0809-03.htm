<p>BAGHDAD - An Iraqi prayer leader on Friday urged Muslims across the world to 

rally behind Iraq in the face of U.S. threats which he said were tantamount to 

waging war on Islam.

<p>"America does not target only Iraq, it targets Islam...This  is a war against Islam," Sheikh Abdul-Ghafour al-Qaisi said  during Friday prayers at Baghdad's Grand Imam mosque.<p>"Muslims must show their strength, cooperation and  solidarity in the face of this evil and this aggression," he  said in a sermon broadcast live on Iraqi television.<p>The cleric said the Iraqi people were firmly behind  President Saddam Hussein.<p>"Saddam is Iraq and Iraq is Saddam," he said.<p>President Bush wants Saddam ousted. He accuses Iraq of  developing weapons of mass destruction and has been hearing  proposals from Pentagon officials for possible military action.<p>In a defiant address to the nation in Thursday, Saddam  warned potential invaders they would be "digging their own  graves" if they attacked Iraq.<p>The United States branded the speech irrelevant and the  United Nations said it gave no rise to optimism that Iraq would  admit U.N. arms inspectors, seen as key to avoiding a possible  war.<p>Thousands of Iraqi civilians clad in military fatigues and  clutching assault rifles have paraded in Baghdad this week,  vowing to defend Saddam to the death.<p>Qaisi called on scholars of Islam everywhere to join the  struggle.<p>"We appeal to you from Baghdad, from Iraq ... to stand on  the side of right and issue your fatwas (religious edicts)  against this brutal force," he said.<p>In Washington, representatives of six exiled Iraqi  opposition groups will open talks with U.S. officials on Friday  on ways to oust Saddam. They will also hold talks with  Vice-President Dick Cheney, currently on vacation at his home  in Wyoming, by video link-up on Saturday.<p>The session with Cheney is a measure of the importance  Washington is attaching to the Iraqi opposition after years of  dismissing it as divided and ineffective.<p>Opposition groups have urged Bush not to try to topple  Saddam without a clear plan of what would replace him. Key U.S.  allies and Arab governments have also warned against a military  strike.<p>Bush said this week he has not ruled out a diplomatic  solution but the White House said there was nothing new in  Saddam's speech, dismissing it as bluster from an isolated  dictator.

<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Saddam did not "give an inch" on the 

return of weapons inspectors to Iraq and gave no cause for optimism, unless there 

were "unforeseen developments."</span>
