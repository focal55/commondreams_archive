<p>Harvard University's English department, in a surprising reversal, has reinvited 

writer Tom Paulin to give a poetry reading on campus, one week after English professors 

and Paulin canceled the event because of complaints over Paulin's statements that 

Brooklyn-born Jewish settlers in Israel were ''Nazis'' who ''should be shot dead.'' 

<P> After an intense two-hour discussion Tuesday evening that Harvard poet Jorie 

Graham said was marked by ''profound, acute scrutiny and self-scrutiny,'' English 

professors voted overwhelmingly to ask Paulin again to deliver Harvard's prestigious 

Morris Gray Lecture, and thereby defend the department against charges it had 

damaged free speech at Harvard. 

<P> ''Free speech was a principle that needed upholding here,'' English professor 

Peter Sacks said yesterday. ''This was a clear reaffirmation that the department 

stood strongly by the First Amendment.'' 

<P> While some professors had voiced free-speech concerns before the Paulin speech 

was canceled last week, they were drowned out by the roar of Paulin's critics, 

including students who began organizing a boycott of the reading and swamping 

English professors with angry e-mailed messages. 

<P> As the controversy grew - and President Lawrence H. Summers told department 

members that he objected to Paulin's poetry reading but was leaving the fate of 

it up to them - noted poetry scholar Helen Vendler and a few other professors 

quickly huddled with Paulin and decided to cancel the event. 

<P> The cancellation drew significant attention at Harvard and other campuses 

nationwide, with many scholars and First Amendment advocates dismayed that the 

English department would distance itself from an award-winning poet such as Paulin. 

It also caused a firestorm in the Harvard English department, with several literature 

professors cringing at the specter of trampled speech - and some of them concerned 

that Summers had applied pressure on the department, and that he was conveying 

his opinions about Paulin by way of a tenured English faculty member, Elisa New, 

with whom he is romantically involved. 

<P> Both Summers and New have told English department members that they found 

Paulin's comments about Israel objectionable. Two English professors said that, 

in reading New's view in an e-mail, they were concerned she was making an argument 

for Summers, too. The professors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say the 

romantic relationship has been a complicated factor in the English department; 

one described feeling ''paranoid'' when speaking to New, for fear the discussion 

would get back to Summers. 

<P> New, a scholar of Puritan poetry and Jewish literature, denied yesterday that 

she ever acted as a ''surrogate'' for Summers, in the words of two professors. 

She said she has consistently supported Paulin's poetry reading, and has called 

for a public forum where Paulin's speech could be challenged. ''I speak for no 

one but myself, and I carry no messages,'' New said in an e-mail. 

<P> Alan J. Stone, a spokesman for Summers, added, ''Anyone who knows Professor 

New knows she speaks only for herself. Anyone who knows Larry Summers knows he 

has no difficulty making his views known directly.'' 

<P> On Tuesday evening, the first time the full English faculty had a chance to 

discuss Paulin since the reading was canceled, Vendler and New - along with professors 

Marjorie Garber, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Elaine Scarry, and others - argued strenuously 

for reinviting Paulin and sending a message that the English department supported 

free speech, even if it is controversial or offensive. 

<P> ''Our feeling of accountability to colleagues in other departments, as well 

as other universities, was also, of course, in range,'' Graham said. ''We are 

not the only ones to use speech, to worry about its nature and power and reach, 

especially at present.'' 

<P> Paulin, who has written extensively about the violence in Northern Ireland, 

was invited last winter, and had been scheduled to speak on campus last Thursday. 

Days before the reading, however, students and alumni contacted English professors 

to protest recent remarks by Paulin - in particular, a poem in which he refers 

to the Israeli Army as a ''Zionist SS,'' and an interview with an Egyptian newspaper 

that quotes Paulin describing Brooklyn-born Jews living in Israeli settlements 

as ''Nazis'' and ''racists'' and saying that they ''should be shot dead.'' 

<P> ''While we in no sense endorse the extreme statements by Mr. Paulin that have 

occasioned concern in the Harvard community, we support a university environment 

that is host to a diversity of views,'' Lawrence Buell, the department chairman, 

said in a statement yesterday. 

<P> Harvard professors said yesterday that Paulin told them he wanted to come 

to Harvard, but wanted to discuss the invitation further with English professors. 

<P> Free-speech issues have engulfed Harvard this semester, ever since Summers 

made a powerful speech at Memorial Church in September decrying campus activities 

that may be viewed as tacitly supporting anti-Semitism. 

<P> This month, Harvard Business School officials reprimanded two students for 

publishing a satiric cartoon in a campus newspaper that the officials found insulting. 

And Monday afternoon, a Harvard Law School committee announced plans to draft 

a proposed harassment speech code. 

<P> Summers, in a statement yesterday, affirmed Harvard's support for free speech, 

saying, ''We are ultimately stronger as a university if we together maintain our 

robust commitment to free expression, including the freedom of groups on campus 

to invite speakers with controversial views.'' 

<P> Asked if Summers had spoken to Buell or other English professors about the 

initial cancellation, Summers's spokesman, Stone, said the subject came up ''in 

casual conversation with a few colleagues, but only in passing and not in a directive 

way.'' 

<P> Several students in Jewish organizations at Harvard said yesterday that they 

were appalled the English department had honored Paulin with the Gray Lecture, 

but that they support his right to speak if invited, and plan to protest if Paulin 

comes. But some observers were astonished. 

<P> ''For the people who made this decision to reduce it to an issue of free speech 

is not only a distortion of free speech in this society, but it is, even worse, 

an opportunity to use the concept of free speech as a shield against the assumption 

of moral responsibility,'' said Robert Leikind, director of the New England regional 

office of the Anti-Defamation League.
