<p>Iraq says its forthcoming report detailing its weapons programs will  not  include any admission that it has weapons of mass destruction. <P>

General Mohammed Amin, the Iraqi official working with U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq, said Wednesday evening in Baghdad the report demanded by the U.N. by Sunday will be huge, with "new elements".   But he said the report will not include so-called "prohibited activities" - an apparent reference to weapons of mass destruction. <P>

The developments came as U.N. monitors in Iraq continued to search for weapons.  A U.N. spokesman said the number of inspectors and inspection sites will increase in the days ahead. <P>

One U.N. team headed northwest of the capital, Baghdad, to make sure work at a demolished center for chemical weapons had not resumed, while another team traveled south of the capital to a facility associated with Iraq's nuclear program. <P>

Meanwhile, a Baghdad-based U.N. spokesman, Hiro Ueki, said inspectors will increase the number of sites they visit starting next week, when more arms experts arrive in Iraq.  Mr. Ueki said several waves of inspectors will start arriving on Sunday. 

            <P> The United States has urged the United Nations to take a more 

              aggressive approach on inspections, which are now into their second 

              week. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Wednesday the United 

              States wants the U.N. to begin multiple, simultaneous weapons inspections 

              to ensure that Iraq meets its disarmament demands. U.N. Secretary-General 

              Kofi Annan and U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell both say the 

              inspections seem to have gotten off to a good start. On Monday, 

              President Bush said so far the signs of Iraqi cooperation are not 

              encouraging. But Wednesday the president did not assess Baghdad's 

              cooperation with U.N. inspections, saying "time will tell".
