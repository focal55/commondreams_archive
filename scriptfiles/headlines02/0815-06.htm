<p> The death of a Palestinian teenager in an Israeli army operation has revived the debate over human shields.  

<P>The young man was shot on Wednesday in the West Bank town of Tubas. 

<P> He was forced to go to the door of a house where a Hamas militant was believed 

to be hiding. 

<P> The use of Palestinian human shields became an issue during Israel's sweeping 

military operations in April, when human rights organisations petitioned the supreme 

court to order a stop to the practice. 

<P> <B>Hail of bullets</B> 

<P> Palestinian witnesses said 19-year-old Nidal Abumuhsein was forced at gunpoint 

to try and get the senior Hamas militant to surrender. 

<P> They said the Israeli army gave him a protective flack jacket and a sniffer 

dog. 

<P> When he knocked on the door he was killed by a burst of bullets, although 

Tubas residents claim they came from the soldiers, not the house. 

<P> The army said it was trying to prevent deaths by having the teenager warn 

any civilians who may have been inside. 

<P> <B>Heated debates </B>

<P> But the Israeli human rights group, B'tselem, strongly condemned the incident 

as another example of Palestinians being used to shield Israeli forces from potential 

danger. 

<P> Several months ago, it petitioned the supreme court, along with other human 

rights activists to rule against the practice. 

<P>The group said the army was using civilians to check booby trapped buildings, 

remove suspicious objects from roads, and walk in front of soldiers to ward off 

gunfire. 

<P> The government responded by forbidding such practices. 

<P> But it drew a distinction between human shields and, what it calls "neighbourhood 

procedure", that is, using civilians to help soldiers enter Palestinian homes, 

or approach besieged militants to negotiate an end to a standoff. 

<P> B'tselem is demanding that this should also be prohibited. 

<P> But the issue is a matter of debate in Israel. 

<P> A number of government ministers told Israeli media that the country was in 

a war situation, and sometimes the lives of Palestinian civilians had to be endangered, 

to prevent attacks in Israel, or to protect Israeli soldiers. </p>
