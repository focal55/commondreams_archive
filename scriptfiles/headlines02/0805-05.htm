<p>WASHINGTON -- Despite an intensifying debate over military action against Iraq, 

the U.S. military is moving troops, equipment and communications gear into the 

region in an indication that President Bush may order an attack within months 

to drive Saddam Hussein from power. 

<P>Pentagon officials decline to discuss troop movements, but there is little 

doubt among defense experts and a former commander with combat experience in Iraq 

that military leaders are laying the groundwork for an assault sometime next year 

should Bush order it. 

<P>Among the indications of attack preparations, according to experts: 

<P>-- Army Gen. Tommy Franks has moved the headquarters of the Third Army to Kuwait 

from Fort McPherson, Ga. The Third Army would form the backbone of any invasion 

force. 

<P>-- Army units in Kuwait include so-called quartering parties -- soldiers who 

plan the logistics required for the arrival of large numbers of other troops. 

<P>-- The Army's crack 101st Airborne Division is being withdrawn from Afghanistan 

and sent back to Fort Campbell, Ky. The 101st is an air assault division that 

can deploy anywhere within 36 hours. 

<P>"This is a logical thing to do in the context of a coming campaign," said retired 

Army Col. W. Patrick Lang, former chief Middle East intelligence analyst with 

the Defense Intelligence Agency. "To go to Kuwait, then to Baghdad and beyond, 

you need high mobility, and the air mobile division should be brought together 

in its entirety to participate in that." 

<P>Bush has said he wants "a regime change" in Baghdad because of Hussein's efforts 

to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But opposition to military 

action was evident during two days of hearings last week before the Senate Foreign 

Relations Committee. 

<P>A resolution co-sponsored by California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein demands 

congressional assent before a war with Iraq is launched. 

<P>"There has been no real consultation with Congress, no real laying out of the 

case, no evidence showing complicity with 9/11 by Iraq, no evidence that there's 

a strong multilateral coalition," Feinstein told The Chronicle last week. 

<P>But Anthony Cordesman, a defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International 

Studies in Washington, said there "almost certainly" are preparations being made 

that are "long-lead, low-visibility efforts." 

<P>Recently the military has moved communications gear, including a sophisticated 

air operations center, to Qatar and built up forces and hangars at Qatar's al-Udeid 

air base. The base has a 15,000-foot runway, the longest in the region, that can 

accommodate the Air Force's largest transport planes. 

<P>In addition, the U.S. Maritime Administration, which monitors the fleet of 

cargo ships that would be needed to ship heavy Army weaponry overseas, is closely 

examining the condition of that fleet to ensure they are ready for duty. 

<P>Retired Army Gen. George Joulwan, former commander of NATO, says troop movements, 

especially around the Persian Gulf states of Kuwait and Qatar, are the normal 

positioning of forces given ongoing military operations in Afghanistan. However, 

he said, "they are also prudent in case there is a mission of attacking Iraq." 

<P>The Army has about 20,000 soldiers mainly in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi 

Arabia. The Navy and Marine Corps maintain headquarters staff in Bahrain with 

nearly 3,000 personnel, while the Air Force has several air bases in the region 

including a headquarters in Saudi Arabia. Another 12,000-plus military personnel, 

including Marines and sailors, are spread across several warships in the Persian 

Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. 

<P>In addition, the Army and Marine Corps have had considerable amounts of equipment 

already positioned in the region since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, including tanks 

and other armor. 

<P>Operation Desert Storm, which drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991, required a 

six-month build-up of forces and more than 500,000 U.S. military personnel. But 

various battle concepts under consideration call for attack forces ranging up 

to about 250,000 troops and presumably would require far less time to move to 

the region. </p>
