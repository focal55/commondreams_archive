<p>LONDON, Sept 17  - Genetically modified crops in

North America have been an economic disaster, which has caused

some farm groups there to call for a moratorium on GM wheat, the

next proposed crop to be altered, a report released on Tuesday

said.</p>

<p> The study by the <a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/" target="_new">Soil 

Association</a>, Britain's leading organic organization, estimated that gene-altered 

maize, soya and rapeseed may have cost the U.S. economy $12 billion since 1999 

in farm subsidies, lower crop prices, loss of major export orders and product 

recalls.</p>

<p> Scientists have said that the advent of such crops could be the answer to 

world hunger, but the report said claims of increased yields have not been realized 

overall -- except for a small increase in some maize yields.</p>

<p> The report said farmers are not achieving the higher profits

promised by the biotech companies as markets for GM food

collapse, citing widespread GM contamination at all levels of

the food and farming industry as the source.</p>

<p> "Within a few years of the introduction of GM crops, almost

the entire $300 million annual US maize exports to the EU had

disappeared, and the US share of the soya market had decreased,"

the report said.</p>

<p> "The lost export trade as a result of GM crops is thought to have caused a 

fall in farm prices and hence a need for increased government subsidies, estimated 

at an extra $3-$5 billion annually," it added.</p>

<p> MORATORIUM</p>

<p> It found that severe problems with gene-spliced crops has

led more than 200 groups representing farmers and the organic

sector in North America to call for a moratorium on the

introduction of GM wheat.</p>

<p> For the last several years, leading biotech company Monsanto

 has stressed the benefits its genetically modified

Roundup Ready wheat can bring to farmers.</p>

<p> The herbicide resistant strain, for which Monsanto is

currently seeking regulatory approval, could mean efficiencies

and potentially higher yields for farmers, according to the

firm.</p>

<p> Public opinion in Europe is wary of gene-altered crops after

a string of food safety scares, including mad cow disease, and

there is a three-year de facto ban in place on approvals of new

GM varieties.</p>

<p> Soil Association Director Peter Melchett said the report came as a timely 

note of caution to Britain ahead of a decision due next year on whether to commercialize 

GM crops following its three-year field test program.</p>

<p> "With UK agriculture still suffering a deep economic crisis,

the temptation to seize a new technology is great," he told the

media at the report's launch.</p>

<p> "GM technology was introduced to the USA when farmers were

financially vulnerable. The biotechnology industry's claims that

their products would bring benefits were widely accepted, but GM

crops have now proved to be a financial liability," he added.</p>

<p> Melchett said he hoped the report would result in a better informed public 

debate, and a more independent, less pressurized decision about the commercialization 

of GM crops in the UK.</p>

<p> Britain's government formally launched a public debate on the issue earlier 

this year, but trust in biotech companies took a battering recently with the disclosure 

of small impurities in field trials for oilseed rape, which threatened to derail 

the government's field trial program. on the environmental impact of such crops. 

</p>

<p> The blunder also prompted UK environment minister Michael

Meacher to break with the government's broadly GM-sympathetic

government line, saying that the country was being pressured by

the U.S. to allow commercial planting of gene-spliced crops.</p>

<p> "I do think it's right that there are people in the

government who are beginning to see that you cannot both promote

organic farming and promote GMO's at the same time," Melchett

said.
