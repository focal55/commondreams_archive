<p>Armed with an 18th century law written to imprison pirates, activists 

are dragging American corporations into court over abuses they allegedly 

commit abroad.

<P>Some suits charge companies with polluting foreign lands, others with 

violating human rights. One closely watched case, which tries to link 

California's Unocal Corp. to alleged forced labor in Burma, may go to trial 

this September after a judge refused this week to throw it out.

<P>The U.S. activists have yet to win a major victory, but that hasn't 

deterred them. They want nothing less than a change of corporate behavior 

around the globe.

<P>"You can move to a lawless place and hope you'll get away with murder there, but you're not going to do it," said Terry Collingsworth, director of the 

<a href="http://www.laborrights.org/" target="_new">International Labor Rights Fund</a>, which is pursuing the Unocal suit. "If you 

try, you'll be held liable just as you would if it were in Nevada."

<P>The suits also represent a blurring of borders in the legal world. American 

judges once were hesitant to step into disputes outside the United States. In 

the past 20 years, however, they have heard arguments over alleged torture, 

murder and rape committed in foreign countries.

<P>"We've started to send our law out of the bounds of the United States," 

said Kal Raustiala, professor of law at UCLA. "It's made the world much more 

complicated."

<P><b>KEY RULING SET STAGE</b>

<P>Most of the cases rely on a law written in 1789 as the young American 

republic tried to prosecute pirates. The Alien Tort Claims Act lay dormant for 

decades until, in 1980, an appeals court ruled that the act allowed foreigners 

to sue each other in America over charges of breaking international laws or 

legal norms.

<P>At first, such cases involved individuals accused of such crimes as torture 

or murder. Now, however, lawyers and activists have used the law to sue 

companies.

<P>The strategy has not yet won a significant legal victory. Some judges have 

proved resistant, tossing out cases after deciding they don't belong in 

American courts. Other courts, however, have allowed such cases to proceed.

<P>Oil firms have become frequent targets. San Francisco's ChevronTexaco Corp., for example, stands accused in two very different cases.

<P>In one, filed against Texaco before its merger with Chevron, the company is 

blamed for poisoning the environment in Ecuador by dumping hazardous waste as 

part of oil pumping operations.

<P>The other suit, originally filed against a premerger Chevron, seeks to hold 

the company responsible for both the death of protesters who occupied a 

Nigerian oil drilling platform in 1998 and attacks on residents of two 

Nigerian villages in 1999. The protesters were shot and killed by Nigerian 

security forces ferried to the scene in helicopters used by the joint venture 

that ran the platform.

<P>Both cases involve projects of ChevronTexaco subsidiaries, rather than the 

parent company itself. But lawyers and activists say responsibility for 

alleged misdeeds must rest with the parent corporation and should be pursued 

in the country that corporation calls home.

<P><b>SUITS AIMED AT PARENT COMPANY</b>

<P>"The whole point of these cases is not just to hold some far-flung 

subsidiary responsible," said San Francisco lawyer Cindy Cohn, one of several 

attorneys working on the Nigeria case. "The parent company lives here. You sue 

the defendant where the defendant lives."

<P>Cohn has more pressing reasons for pushing her case in America. Nigeria's 

legal system lacks the political independence needed for a balanced, impartial 

trial, she said.

<P>"Our clients couldn't get a fair shake in Nigerian courts," she said.

<P>ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell said that while the company regrets the 

loss of life in Nigeria, its subsidiary's employees did nothing wrong and only 

called for help from law enforcement after three days of negotiations with the 

protesters.

<P>The company also objects to trying the lawsuits in America. Speaking of the 

Ecuadoran case, company spokesman Chris Gidez said that pursuing the case here 

instead of Ecuador makes little sense.

<P>"The operations are there," he said. "The evidence is there. The plaintiffs 

are there. To think that a U.S. jury could manage this litigation when 

everything is going to be in another language and everything is in Ecuador is 

preposterous."

<P>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff last year agreed, dismissing the suit, he 

wrote, "Because the record establishes overwhelmingly that these cases have 

everything to do with Ecuador and nothing to do with the United States." The 

plaintiffs have appealed.

<P>Oil companies aren't the only firms coming under scrutiny. Activists also 

are pursuing a class- action suit against some of the nation's most prominent 

clothing retailers -- including Gap Inc. and Levi Strauss & Co. -- alleging 

sweatshop conditions in clothing factories on Saipan, part of the U.S. 

Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. That case differs from others, 

however, in that the supposed abuses took place in a U.S. territory rather 

than a foreign country.

<P>Many of the lawyers and activists pursuing such cases say they hope the 

Unocal case proves to be a breakthrough. The suit accuses Burma's military of 

using forced labor in connection with a pipeline project in which Unocal had a 

part. The company argues that Unocal never sought to use forced labor on the 

project, and that the people running the project tried to prevent such a 

possibility.

<P>Should Unocal lose, the verdict could become as much a legal milestone for 

social justice as the first courtroom victories for America's racial 

desegregation movement, Collingsworth said.

<P>"It probably seemed at least as big a long shot as one of our cases to 

think that Thurgood Marshall could win a case before racist judges," he said. 

"This could be our Brown vs. Board of Education."
