<p> WASHINGTON - Harken Energy Corp. was in bad financial shape, facing a painful 

liquidity crisis and restructuring when George W. Bush sold some $850,000 worth 

of shares in the firm in June 1990. Evidence in government files indicates he 

had at least partial knowledge of the company's troubles before he sold the stock. 

<P> Records from a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation indicate that 

Bush, who served on Harken's board of directors and was a member of a special 

committee to deal with the financial troubles, had been warned about the company's 

financial crisis by its president, Mikel D. Faulkner, and other officers before 

selling his stock. 

<P> On April 20, 1990, Faulkner wrote to the members of Harken's board that the 

company was facing a liquidity crisis and that crucial plans to sell new shares 

of stock were diminished, due to a slumping oil market. The firm was also facing 

pressure from its lenders, especially the Bank of Boston, which ''greatly intensifies 

our current liquidity problem,'' Faulkner wrote. 

<P> On May 18, 1990, according to the SEC files, Harken's senior vice president, 

Bruce N. Huff, wrote to Harken's special committee - made up of Bush, Faulkner, 

and director E. Stuart Watson - to alert them of the ''negative repercussions'' 

that could occur if they did not approve a series of waivers and extensions of 

corporate loans. 

<P> The Bank of Boston refused to renegotiate its loans, and the stock sale had 

to be put off. ''The immediate focus of the company was at that time redirected 

to raising cash,'' Huff acknowledged in a 1991 letter to the SEC. ''By June 1990, 

the company was constrained by its worsening cash and credit situation. ... The 

company was in the midst of the severe cash crisis.'' 

<P> Bush sold 212,140 shares of Harken stock on June 22, 1990, two months before 

Harken reported a $23.2 million quarterly loss that was tied, in part, to the 

restructuring efforts. He was investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission 

for possible insider trading when the SEC learned of the sale the following spring, 

eight months after it was required to be reported. The SEC ultimately closed its 

investigation, and Bush was never charged with any violation of securities laws. 

His father was president of the United States at the time. 

<P> In its last public disclosure preceding Bush's sale, Harken had announced 

only a $2 million operating loss for the first quarter. The public did not know, 

and Bush says he did not know, that Harken was about to post the whopping second-quarter 

loss that August, even though he had a seat on Harken's three-member special audit 

committee, as well as its eight-member board of directors. 

<P> ''I wouldn't have sold if I had,'' Bush told The Washington Post in 1999. 

''I got clearance by the lawyer [Harken's general counsel] to sell this stock.'' 

<P> When closing the probe in 1991, SEC investigators concluded that Bush was 

not privy to the full extent of the financial problems facing Harken. They also 

believed, records show, that proving a case that Bush acted with intent to defraud 

would be difficult because he had openly consulted the firm's officers and lawyers 

before selling his stock. Building a case would also be difficult because of the 

challenge in showing that the information he knew was legally material to the 

case. 

<P> ''This was done the regular way, and had there been conduct that warranted 

recommendation for enforcement you can believe me the recommendation would have 

been made,'' said William McLucas, the SEC's enforcement director at the time. 

<P> The proceeds of the Harken sale served as the bankroll that Bush used to pay 

off a loan he took to buy his interest in the Texas Rangers baseball team. The 

sale of his interest in the Rangers made him a multimillionaire. The SEC general 

counsel at the time Bush was investigated was James R. Doty, the same lawyer who 

represented Bush in the Rangers deal. 

<P> A slumping oil market and other setbacks had led Harken to take a series of 

steps in 1989 to address its poor financial picture. The company seemed frank 

about its red ink: In quarterly reports at the time it disclosed to potential 

investors that it was losing several million dollars a quarter. 

<P> In 1989, Harken sold one of its assets, Aloha Petroleum Ltd., to a group of 

investors that included Harken's chairman and another Harken director. The $8 

million profit from the sale allowed Harken to report a mere $3.3 million loss 

for 1989. 

<P> Harken's financial outlook got another quick fix when, in early 1990, the 

Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain announced that it had granted the firm an exclusive 

contract to drill for offshore oil. Investors, thinking perhaps that Bahrain was 

delivering a plum for the president's son, looked on Harken favorably. 

<P> But on Aug. 20, 1990, Harken told the world that it had lost $23.2 million 

for the quarter ending June 30, 1990. And, in 1991, the SEC stepped in and ordered 

the firm to restate its 1989 report, canceling the profits from the Aloha deal 

and listing its losses for that year at more than $12 million. 

<P> By then, Bush had sold 212,140 of the 317,152 shares he owned at $4 a share. 

After selling his shares in Harken, Bush waited 36 weeks to report the sale on 

the required SEC Form 4. When asked during his press conference Tuesday why it 

took so long to report, Bush said, ''I still haven't figured it out completely.'' 

<P> The Form 4 was filed on March 4, 1991, and the SEC staff launched an investigation. 

On Aug. 21, 1991, according to SEC documents, the staff concluded ''that there 

is insufficient evidence to recommend an enforcement action against Bush.'' The 

staff said Bush did not have advance notice of most of the losses revealed in 

the Aug. 20 announcement, because they were in the form of write-downs and restructuring 

expenses that occurred after Bush completed the sale. 

<P> Though Bush was on the special audit committee, which was dealing with how 

to restructure and present the firm's debts to the public and its shareholders, 

the SEC investigators concluded that he was not part of the Harken executive committee 

that found in August that the company was facing an imminent quarterly loss of 

$6.7 million, a $7.2 million write down of the Aloha deal, and $4.4 million in 

other expenses. ''It does not appear that he possessed material nonpublic information,'' 

the investigators said. 

<P> The Harken special audit committee ''met relatively infrequently and was concerned 

with matters related to Harken's recently completed audit'' and not usually privy 

to the weekly financial reports available to the Harken executives, the SEC investigators 

said. In early June, Bush did receive one flash report along with the executive 

committee, which projected that the quarterly operating loss for that quarter 

would be approximately $4.2 million. But that, the SEC said, was ''consistent 

with Harken's publicly reported trend of quarterly operating losses.'' 

<P> The investigators interviewed the broker who represented the buyer of Bush's 

stock. The broker told the investigators that he had solicited Bush on a cold 

call on behalf of an interested client in early June. 

<P> After initially declining to do so, Bush and Harken waived the attorney-client 

privilege, and the Harken firm's lawyer told the SEC that Bush had properly checked 

with him and through him the firm's officers and its outside counsel, to make 

sure there would be no legal problems in the sale. Bush sold the Harken stock 

- and other investments in the same period - to pay off the bank loan of about 

$600,000 that he had obtained to invest in the Rangers baseball team, a tax bill 

of some $200,000, and because ''his financial adviser/accountant ... was bugging 

him to get liquid,'' the corporate lawyer told the SEC. 

<P> The openness of those consultations would make it hard to prove that Bush 

was scheming to evade the law, the investigators decided. 

<P> Given Bush's actions before selling, ''it would be difficult to establish 

that, even assuming Bush possessed material nonpublic information, he acted with 

... intent to defraud,'' the SEC investigators concluded. 

<P> Nor did the market react precipitously to the August announcement, the SEC 

said. The stock dipped by almost a third from its $3-a-share price when Harken 

anounced its losses, but rebounded the next day to its previous level. 

<P> Bush's failure to file the Form 4 when he sold the Harken stock was commonplace 

in the 1980s, securities specialists say. Indeed, the SEC also found that Bush 

was late in filing a Form 4 regarding Harken transactions on three other occasions. 

<P> The memos and correspondence from the SEC files were obtained by the Center 

for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research group here, through a Freedom of Information 

Act request.
