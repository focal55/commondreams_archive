<p>HAVANA  - As the Bush administration prepares to announce a more aggressive policy against President Fidel Castro that could include channeling resources to dissidents, former President Jimmy Carter strongly warned today that such a move would be counterproductive. </p>

<p>On the final day of a six-day visit, Mr. Carter said at a news conference this morning that dissidents he met with on Thursday ``expressed deep concerns'' that any direct help from the United States would help Mr. Castro discredit their efforts. </p>

<p>After a broad policy review, Mr. Bush is expected to announce new measures on Monday that could include providing assistance for dissidents, human rights advocates and independent journalists on the island. </p>

<p>``For them to be connected directly to the U.S. government, or indirectly to the U.S. government, for financing, would damage severely their integrity,'' Mr. Carter said, just before departing from Cuba. </p>

<p>While President Bush has said he is a friend to Cubans seeking democracy, dissidents here are uncomfortable with several points in what they have heard through the news media of his new policy. An adviser to Mr. Carter said that many dissidents favored lifting the four-decade-old trade embargo, which Mr. Bush is proposing to tighten. </p>

<p>Dissidents have said before that they reject United States aid because it would taint their efforts, especially the Varela Project, a petition drive seeking a referendum to gain increased freedoms. One of Mr. Castro's main arguments against the project is that it was a foreign creation. </p>

<p>Mr. Carter said the Cuban government would now have to decide how to respond to the petition campaign's demands. He urged it to allow public debate, after the state-run media published his speech, in which he endorsed the Varela project and criticized the Communist government for denying rights. </p>

<p>``I would say the millions of Cubans who now know about it for the first time will have their concerns assuaged by the proper actions of the government,'' Mr. Carter said. </p>

<p>``Will it be completely discounted? Will there be an open dialogue about it?'' </p>

<p>Mr. Carter said he hoped that before President Bush announced his Cuba policy, the president would review a report Mr. Carter will send him on his conclusions from the trip, which included ``extensive'' discussions with Mr. Castro. </p>

<p>Mr. Carter today repeated his call for the United States to end the trade embargo and allow Americans to travel to Cuba. He said that greater cooperation among scientific researchers, especially, would help dispel any fears that the Cuban government was conducting research on biological weapons, as the State Department recently alleged. </p>

<p>Mr. Carter argued that trade and travel restrictions on Cuba should be removed because they restrain fundamental American freedoms. </p>

<p>``I think an American citizen or an American company has the right to visit any place on earth and the right to trade with any purchaser or supplier on earth,'' he said. </p>

<p>Mr. Carter said his delegation also brought along some 500 pages of declassified documents from the National Archives that detail his administration's efforts to ease relations with Cuba. </p>

<p>The rapprochement, which included the release of political prisoners and allowing travel to the island, collapsed over Cuba's refusal to remove its troops from Angola and Ethiopia. </p>

<p>Robert Pastor, who served as Mr. Carter's national security adviser on Latin America, said he hoped that the Cubans would declassify similar documents in order for both countries to study and learn from that era. </p>

<p>``Forty-three years of old habits are not easy to overcome,'' Mr. Pastor said. ``But no one can any longer ignore the germ of the idea that there is an alternative to the insults and recriminations between the United States and Cuba.'' </p>
