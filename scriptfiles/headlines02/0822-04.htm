<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain set itself apart from top ally the United States, 

which has made a "regime change" in Baghdad a priority, saying on Thursday its 

main aim in Iraq was to get weapons inspectors back in.

<p>In comments that underlined differences between President Bush and London, 

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the main threat was from Iraqi President Saddam 

Hussein's suspected capability with weapons of mass destruction.

<p>"What everybody is concerned about...is particularly the threat that Saddam 

Hussein poses from both his capability and his record to the security of the region 

and the security of the world," Straw told BBC radio.

<p>"The best way of trying to isolate and reduce that threat is by the introduction 

of weapons inspections," he said. "The crucial issue here is weapons inspectors."

<p>Bush by contrast has made the ousting of Saddam a top priority, saying the 

Iraqi leader is developing weapons of mass destruction and must be stopped before 

he can use them against the United States and its allies, or share them with terrorist 

groups.

<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair has signaled he would back U.S.-led military 

action, but faces growing opposition from members of his own left-of-center Labour 

Party, church leaders and, according to some reports, members of his own cabinet.

<p>Challenged on whether there was any international coalition that would back 

military action against Iraq, Straw ducked the question. He instead said: "What 

there is, is an overwhelming international consensus against what Saddam Hussein 

has been doing and failing to do in Iraq."

<p>Bush said on Wednesday that he would continue to consult with his allies on 

the issue of Iraq but again repeated his view that "regime change is in the interests 

of the world."

<p>Straw said Britain would of course be happy if Saddam were to be removed, but 

stressed: "The key part of our approach is to get the weapons inspectors back.

<p>"We have to say military action remains an option...because of the threat posed 

by Saddam Hussein. But if there is another way of dealing with that threat then 

plainly the case for military action recedes," he said.

<p>CLEAR RIFT?

<p>Menzies Campbell, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition Liberal Democrats, 

said Straw's comments were evidence of a clear rift between the transatlantic 

allies.

<p>"The foreign secretary's remarks place Britain in a quite different position 

from the hawks in the Bush administration," he said in a statement.

<p>"The UK government should now be leading the charge to compel Saddam Hussein 

to readmit the U.N. inspectors with full, unfettered and open access to every 

installation they wish."

<p>But a spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was wrong to suggest the Foreign 

Secretary's comments showed a difference in approach.

<p>"The U.S. and other members of the (U.N.) Security Council have called on numerous 

occasions for the reintroduction of weapons inspections in Iraq. And the U.S. 

has made clear, like us, that no decision has been taken to launch military action," 

he said.

<p>Saddam has made various overtures to the United Nations in recent weeks about 

allowing teams of U.N. arms inspectors to return after they left four years ago.

<p>Last week Iraq asked the United Nations for further technical talks in Baghdad 

before allowing inspectors back in, but there has so far been no formal U.N. response.

<p>The weapons experts, who went into Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, inspected 

and destroyed weapons before leaving in December 1998 on the eve of a U.S.-British 

bombing raid.</span>
