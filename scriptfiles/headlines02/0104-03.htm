BUENOS AIRES, Argentina  - Argentina's new

President Eduardo Duhalde, blaming free market policies of the

last decade for creating social chaos, asked Congress on Friday

to rescue the economy by allowing a traumatic currency

devaluation.

<p>Duhalde proposed a bill to Congress that seeks special

powers enabling him to dismantle the peg that kept the peso

one-to-one against the U.S. dollar. That peg was blamed for

worsening a four-year economic slump that sparked deadly riots

and political chaos.

<p>Congress, controlled by Duhalde's Peronist party, will

almost certainly pass the bill, which also gives the president

powers to reform the foreign exchange and banking systems,

regulate prices of goods and services, safeguard the value of

savers' bank deposits and ensure debtors do not go bankrupt.

<p>While Congress prepared to act this weekend, Argentines

huddled in pouring rain outside banks wondering if they would

ever recover their deposits. Drug stores ran out of medicines

like insulin, and shops raised prices to hedge against a

devaluation that will be an effective income cut for millions.

<p>Duhalde became the fifth president in over two weeks after

food riots left 27 dead and shook one of Latin America's

wealthiest countries. He is placing the burden of devaluation

on banks, foreign investors and big firms like oil companies.

<p>``We want to finish with an alliance of decades in the

country, the alliance of political power with financial power

at the expense of industry,'' Duhalde, a 60-year-old power

broker known for favoring trade protectionism and heavy state

spending, said in a speech to businessmen.

<p>Harkening back to statism that is largely a thing of the

past in Latin America, he plans to fix price limits for basic

goods and services including bread and telephone service to

stem devaluation-induced hyperinflation of the sort that

ravaged Argentina in the 1980s.

<p>Eager to avoid the social protests that caused President

Fernando de la Rua to resign last month, which heralded

political chaos as three other presidents quickly came and

went, Duhalde has also promised measures to safeguard debtors

and savers.

<p>Economists are skeptical the measures will succeed because

Argentines have lost all confidence in banks and the new system

is seen as open to corruption and growth of a black market.

<p>Some Argentines voted with their feet, lining up by the

Italian consulate to ask for visas to leave the country.

<p>But perhaps in a sign that economic nationalism touched a

cord among Argentines, there were no major street protests

against the measures. Banging of pots and pans by the country's

middle class and their spontaneous marches had already led to

the resignations of two presidents in December.

<p>DRAMATIC SHIFT IN POLICY

<p>The new program is an about-turn from the free market

policies that made Argentina a darling of Wall Street. In Latin

America, most countries have accepted a free-market focus with

polices often encouraged by the United States.

<p>It could pit the government, which defaulted on Thursday on

part of its $141 billion debt in what may become the biggest

default in history, against foreign bond holders and investors.

<p>On Friday, many of the top foreign firms in Argentina, who

benefited from a 1990s privatization program, met to discuss

the government's aim to lock in prices in pesos rather than the

dollars in their concession contracts.

<p>Oil companies will also be hit with a levy on their exports

to compensate banks for what will prove a costly restructuring

of dollar debts.

<p>The bill itself contained no more details on devaluation of

the peso but local media report the devaluation could be around

30 percent. There would be an official rate for foreign trade

and another perhaps for smaller transactions.

<p>It was not clear how a dual exchange rate system would

work. Many Argentines fear a return to the currency paranoia of

the 1980s, when small-time traders lined streets offering

dollars.

<p>Duhalde's plans were met with skepticism.

<p>``I bet he'll tell the bankers exactly what they want to

hear too,'' one businessman from the engineering sector said.

<p>The proposed bill would convert private contracts to pesos

in a country whose currency has been pegged one-to-one to the

dollar for a decade and where even house purchases are made

with wads of dollars. It would restructure small dollar debts

to protect peso-earning Argentines from the devaluation.

<p>Congress is dominated by Duhalde's Peronist Party which

ran the country from 1989 to 1999 and racked up much of the

debt now crippling Argentina.

<p>Despite the nationalist hue, the government did wink to

the foreign financial community by announcing a ``sharp''

reduction in spending demanded by the International Monetary

Fund  and Washington and hopes of ``favorable effects'' in six

months.

<p>IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger talked to

Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov on Friday for the first

time, but the lender did not reveal details of the call.

<p>IMF sources said it would be unlikely that the fund would

support Argentina if it went ahead with the dual currency

system, as such plans are not recommended by the fund's

governing rules.

<p>Argentina's foreign creditors meanwhile said they will

refrain for now from demanding immediate payment on their

defaulted bonds and try to negotiate a restructuring.

<p>Converting dollar debts into pesos should help shield the

average Argentine from the impact of the devaluation, but it

shifts the burden to the banks, which will need help.

<p>``Without support the banks would not remain viable,'' said a

Lehman Bros research note. ``Given that the government neither

has the means to provide this support nor defend/shepherd the

floating or re-pegged peso, we assume IMF support.''</p>
