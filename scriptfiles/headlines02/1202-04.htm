</table></font>LONDON -- Peace campaigners were staging a 'non-violent die-in' outside government 

offices Monday to help bring home the human cost of launching another war against 

Iraq. 

<p>

The demonstration, organised by Voices in the Wilderness UK, is the latest in 

series of protests held throughout Britain. The first acts of civil disobedience 

were staged in October, a month after the biggest peace rally in London for over 

30 years. 

<p>The latest protest included scores of people, bandaged as wounded and lying 

down dead on the road outside the Prime Minister's Office, causing traffic chaos. 

<p>"The projected war with Iraq is immoral, illegal, unnecessary and counter-productive. 

Tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of people will almost certainly be killed if 

the war takes place," Voices in the Wilderness said in promoting the demonstration. 

<p>Those taking part in the non-violent civil disobedience included member of 

the European Parliament for the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, and political comedian 

Mark Thomas.

The protesters said that they agreed with US President George W Bush that "inaction 

is not an option. We must act now to stop the war." 

<p>Contingency plans have also been arranged to stage similar events in Scotland, 

the English southern coastal resort or Brighton and other places. A non-violent 

action weekend is also planned in January at Northwood Military base in London. 

<p>The Voices in the Wilderness UK group was set up in 1998 to campaign for the 

lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq. In the past four years, it has sent 

11 sanctions-breaking delegations to Baghdad. 

<p>Its involvement in the war protests follows a report by London- based Medact 

health charity warning that up to 50,000 casualties, mostly civilian, will die 

in a conventional war against Iraq. </p>
