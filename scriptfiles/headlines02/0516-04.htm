<p>TEHRAN  - 

Iranian President Mohamad Khatami has

accused "a small, but influential group in the United States

(of) threatening the world with war."

<p>

Khatami was speaking on Wednesday during a tour of a

northern province bordering the Caspian Sea, the official IRNA

news agency said on Thursday.

<p>

"We are not so selfish as to accuse all the American nation

of being evil. However there is a small, but influential group

in the United States that is threatening the world with war

through their violent and war-mongering policies," IRNA quoted

the normally mild-mannered president as saying.

<p>

"We have a national, religious and humanitarian duty to

defend our country and we will not surrender to any aggressor,"

Khatami said.

<p>

Sharp rhetoric from Washington has sparked fierce debate in

Tehran, which President George Bush accuses of forming part of

an "axis of evil."

<p>

Some Iranian reformists have called for opening talks with

the "Great Satan" and conservatives have demanded an end to

dissent for the sake of national unity.

<p>

"We don't accuse the United States of being part of an axis

of evil, although we believe that what Washington says today is

clear proof of their evil," Khatami said.

<p>

The reformist president has always argued for trying to

repair ties with Washington, but says it should first apologize

for past misdeeds and ease sanctions on Iran.

<p>

Hard-liners who look to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have

ruled out any talks with their arch-enemy which cut ties with

Iran in 1980 after radical students seized dozens of U.S.

diplomats and held them hostage for 444 days.

<p>

HARD-LINER TALKS WITH U.S.?

<p>

Yet reformists have persistently accused conservatives in

the last month of sending delegates to meet U.S. officials in

Europe and on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. They say

talks should be conducted through official government channels.

<p>

Analysts say Khatami's hawkish comments on relations with

Washington in the last week are an attempt to expose alleged

conservative double-standards on the issue.

<p>

Hard-liners have denied conducting talks with U.S.

officials, but a spokesman for Khatami's government said on

Wednesday the Intelligence Ministry had been asked to

investigate the charges.

<p>

Bush said in January that Iran, along with Iraq and North

Korea, formed "an axis of evil" for trying to develop weapons

of mass destruction.

<p>

Other U.S. leaders have since heaped blame on Iran,

accusing the Islamic Republic of harboring al-Qaeda and Taliban

fighters fleeing from neighboring Afghanistan  -- charges Tehran

denies.

<p>

In his speech Khatami also indirectly accused the United

States of interfering in the Caspian Sea, where U.S. companies

are involved in helping other littoral states develop its

potentially rich energy resources.

<p>

"The Caspian Sea should be under the dominion of the five

coastal countries and foreigners should not interfere in it,"

he said. "We want this sea to be a sea of peace and we are

trying to reach a proper legal regime through dialogue and

understanding."

<p>

The coastal states -- Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia

and Turkmenistan -- have failed to agree on how to divide the

sea's resources since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991

which rendered older treaties out of date.</p>
