<p>Political support grew for the women who have taken on a US oil giant, demanding 

schools, jobs and hospitals for villages in the Niger Delta, as lightning sparked 

a massive fire in the oil plant at the center of the row.</p>

<p>Hundreds of women continued to occupy four ChevronTexaco pumping stations supplying the Escravos oil terminal in southern Nigeria, cutting a flow of 100,000 barrels of crude per day, while trade unionists held a protest rally in the state capital.</p>

Women of the Ijaw tribe hold up a sign saying &quot;give us light and water or 

pack now&quot; as they occupy a ChevronTexaco oil flow station in Makaraba, Nigeria, 

Saturday, July 20, 2002. The company is facing a series of takeovers at its Nigerian 

facilities by unarmed village women who are demanding jobs for their relatives 

as well as electricity, water and other amenities. The two men watching from above 

are contract platform workers left behind who are receiving food from the women.

</table></font>Meanwhile, the fire at the Escravos terminal itself underlined the environmental risks that local people claim the oil industry poses to their polluted region. </p>

<p>The women have the sympathy of Delta State's governor, James Ibori, who told AFP that while he could not support their use of force he endorsed many of their demands.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of anger in the communities," he said. "There's lot of pollution of the water and the air."</p>

<p>The governor has sent representatives to observe Chevron's negotiations with the women, who have presented the oil firm with an impressive -- and probably impossible -- list of demands.</p>

<p>Last week hundreds of women who had occupied the giant export terminal for 11 days won a promise from Chevron it would give their village a school, electricity and clean water.</p>

<p>But the women of the neighboring Ijaw-speaking Gbaramatu community have set 

the bar higher.</p>

<p>According to a list published in the Nigerian press, the women want: an Ijaw director on Chevron Nigeria's board; jobs for women in Chevron offices around the country; schools, electricity and cottage hospitals for eight villages; two palaces for their traditional king; hostels, a library and a science lab for the local high school; jobs for 50 graduates; two deep-sea trawlers and 500 million naira (four million dollars).</p>

<p>Chevron Nigeria spokesman Wole Agunbiade said that negotiations were continuing Sunday and that the firm was committed to resolving the standoff through dialogue.</p>

<p>The president of the Nigeria Labour Congress, the country's main labour body, on Saturday led dozens of workers at a "solidarity rally" in Delta State capital Asaba.</p>

<p>Ibori's spokesman Sheddy Ozoene said: "It was a show of solidarity with the Niger Delta cause, particularly with the protesting women for not being violent in the approach." </p>

<p>According to Ozoene, NLC boss Adams Oshiomhole told the rally that oil companies should be more environmentally-friendly and be ready to share their large profits with host communities.</p>

<p>The environmental danger the oil industry poses to the polluted and impoverished delta region was underlined at the weekend when a tank at Escravos holding 180,000 barrels of crude caught fire after being struck by lightning.</p>

<p>The firm said Sunday that the fire was under control and did not pose a risk 

to the neighboring communities.</p>

<p>Escravos handles slightly less than a quarter of Nigeria's daily oil exports, currently running at around two million barrels per day. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil exporter.</p>

<p>A Chevron worker at the plant told AFP by telephone that after the end of the 

women's 11-day occupation production had restarted but that the second protest 

was still causing "hiccups".</p>

<p>Nigerian soldiers had been deployed to protect the site and nearby installations, he said.</p>

<p>A local Ijaw leader told AFP that the community would cooperate in urging the women to end their protest, but that Chevron would have to strike a deal with them.</p>

<p>"One thing is certain. Chevron has to accede to the demands. This is the only condition that can bring about peace and industrial harmony," Felix Bozimo said.</p>

<p>"We have told them we cannot live at the bank of a river and wash our hands 

with spittle," he said, complaining of the pollution.</p>

<p>"It is Chevron this time. It could be another company some other time," he 

warned.</p>
