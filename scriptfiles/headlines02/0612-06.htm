<p>ROME  - With the United States leading the way, the World Food Summit has formally endorsed biotechnology as a way to address hunger.

<p>

However, the meeting refrained from making reference to organic farming despite the high-profile hoopla by NGOs opposed to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and advocating natural farming methods.

The Declaration of the second World Food Summit, already approved even before the gathering ends Thursday, states openly: "We are committed to study, share and facilitate the responsible use of biotechnology in addressing development needs."

<p>







It also asks for advancement of "research into new technologies, including biotechnology," adding: "The introduction of tried and tested new technologies including biotechnology should be accomplished in a safe manner and adapted to local conditions to help improve agricultural productivity in developing countries."

<p>







At the first World Food Summit, six years ago, the Declaration of Heads of State made no specific reference to biotechnology.

<p>







However, NGO representatives - uniting hundreds of such organizations in a parallel meeting across town in Rome - were stunned by the lack of reference to organic farming and the explicit endorsement of biotechnology.

<p>







"It is incomprehensible," Sergio Marelli, president of the <a href="http://www.oneworld.org/liaison/forum/" target="_new">NGO Forum</a> told IPS. "It shows the influence of nations, led by the United States, upholding the interests of multinationals involved in biotechnology." He said the Forum would respond in a strongly worded statement to the Summit on its last day Thursday.

<p>







The United States government, on the other hand, is making no secret of its powerful and intensified advocacy of biotechnology describing it as a tool to boost productivity in diminishing arable land in the very places where increased food production is needed.

<p>







U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman told the Summit that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is launching a 10-year, 100-million dollar Collaborative Agriculture Biotechnology Initiative to advance research on varieties better suited to growing conditions in developing countries.

<p>







She also announced that the United States would hold a ministerial-level science and technology conference next year to focus on the needs of developing countries in adopting new food and agriculture technologies.

<p>







Currently, as the United States spearheads the 'Who is Afraid of Biotechnology?' crusade, supporters of genetic modification contend that it could yield more food on less land, using less chemicals in a more environment-friendly manner.

<p>







In addition, the United States is already involved in micronutrient-enhanced varieties of cassava, beans, sweet potatoes and high protein maize. In a move to placate opponents that claim that private hands control the biotechnology business, it says it would increase public funds for biotechnology.

<p>







And if proponents at the World Food Summit had their way, the Summit's commitment to biotechnology would have been even stronger, said Italian Agriculture Minister Gianni Alemanno, who has banned GMO cultivation and upholds a "no-tolerance" policy in accidental "contamination" of traditional seeds with GMOs in Italy.

<p>







As vocal as NGOs may be in their anti-biotechnology views, theirs may be more a high-profile protest gesture than a viable alternative to new technologies in food production in the developing world. Still, the NGO Forum president claims that organic farming can do much more to ease hunger if it had the same amount of research and funds now allocated to biotechnology.

<p>







Apart from Argentina and China (both major players in biotechnology), a host of other governments see nothing wrong with GMOs, among them Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, Mali, Zambia, Egypt, Bangladesh and Philippines.

<p>







Leading agronomists from China, India, and Kenya shared the podium with Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug in pro-biotechnology pronouncements organized by the U.S. delegation in a Rome plastered with anti-GMO posters.

<p>







For its part, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), hosting its second Summit in an effort to achieve the still-unmet goal of halving the number of the 800 million hungry by 2015, has a good assessment, mixed with caution, of both biotechnology and organic farming.

<p>









According to an FAO document prepared for the Summit, the "appropriate use of biotechnology offers considerable potential to improve food security," citing tissue culture and molecular markers" and continuing research in drought-resistant and salt-tolerant crops."

<p>







But, adds the FAO, "given the potential risks of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for human health and environment, caution is needed in introducing them". It also asks for a larger role for the public sector in biotechnology.

<p>







FAO also sees unexplored potential for organic farming in the Third World, because demand far outstrips supply in industrialized countries. A growth in organic farming can increase the export earnings of countries shipping agricultural products, but serious questions remain on certification and safety standards.
