<p>BEIJING --Swiss foodmaker Nestle on Thursday denied any wrongdoing after several Chinese newspapers accused it of violating the country's rules on labeling genetically-modified food products. 

<p>The controversy arose after local newspapers picked up on recent charges by the environmental group Greenpeace that Nestle is continuing to sell products with genetically-modified ingredients in Asia, even though public pressure in Europe has forced it stop using such ingredients for products sold there. 

<p>In recent days, several dailies have run front-page stories that repeated the allegations, and quoted Chinese officials saying Nestle hadn't submitted any application to label its products as containing genetically-modified organisms, as new rules issued early this year appear to require. 

<p>

In a statement, Nestle said: "Nestle's products in China...are in strict compliance with the Chinese government regulations and Nestle's own very strict standards respecting international regulations and guidance." 

<p>A spokeswoman for Nestle, who asked that her name not be used, added: "The rules on labeling of genetically-modified food products issued in March of this year apply to imported agricultural products. Nestle's products are processed final-use food products and aren't covered by these rules." 

<p>Nestle hasn't explicitly confirmed or denied that the specific products mentioned in the news reports contain genetically-modified ingredients, but said in its statement: "Genetically modified agricultural produce can be found in China as in the rest of the world, where their use is in line with local regulations." 

<p>In June, Greenpeace Hong Kong said it has been testing Nestle products for genetically-modified ingredients for three years, and found that six products tested positive. 

<p>It said the six products are sold in Hong Kong under the names Pak Fook Fresh Soya Milk, Pak Fook Beancurd Dessert, Pak Fook Hi-calcium Life Soya Milk, Nestle Infant Cereal (apple flavored), Nestle Crunch Chocolate, and Tropical Sundae, an ice-cream product. 

<p>The most likely culprit would be genetically-modified soybeans, which are widely used by the U.S. and other major soy producers. China is a large importer of soybeans, but Nestle's spokeswoman said: "99% of Nestle's China products are made in China and use domestic materials." 

<p>Nestle continues to defend its use of genetically-modified food ingredients, citing research that it says shows that genetically-modified foods are as safe as conventional ones. 

<p>"Nestle supports a responsible application of gene technology for food production based on sound scientific research," the company said in its statement.
