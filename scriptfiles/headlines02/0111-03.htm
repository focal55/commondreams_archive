            WASHINGTON -- The accounting firm Andersen acknowledged Thursday that 

            it destroyed a "significant" number of documents related to its audit 

            of Enron Corp., as the White House disclosed that Enron's chief executive 

            contacted Bush Cabinet members for help when the energy company was 

            collapsing.

            <p>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans 

              said they listened to Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay's description 

              of the firm's dire financial problems last fall but took no action.

</table>Both revelations deepened the controversy over Enron's sudden failure--one 

              that has financial, legal and political overtones. The disclosure 

              by Andersen, until recently known as Arthur Andersen, prompted outrage 

              in Congress and could complicate federal investigations into the 

              massive bankruptcy. Andersen said in a statement that it had disposed 

              of a "significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper 

              documents and correspondence" relating to Enron. Investigators could 

              not immediately say what documents were destroyed. A company spokesman 

              said the matter is under review and would not say whether the destruction 

              was accidental or intentional. The company said millions of documents 

              related to Enron still exist.

            <p>A congressional aide said Andersen notified investigators that 

              "potentially thousands of records" were destroyed in September, 

              October and November. Investigators plan to meet with the head of 

              Andersen's Houston office next week and question him on the matter.

            <p>Despite the administration's efforts to distance itself from the 

              Enron fiasco, the company's huge political footprint continued to 

              create problems. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, his chief of staff and 

              the entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston, where Enron is based, 

              recused themselves from the criminal probe of the company because 

              of potential conflicts of interest.

            <p>Ashcroft received campaign contributions from Enron for his failed 

              2000 Senate campaign, and the U.S. attorney in Houston said many 

              on his staff have family members who could be affected by the Enron 

              bankruptcy.

            <p>The fallout touched the White House, as President Bush ordered 

              senior officials to recommend reforms of the pension system and 

              to examine federal rules governing corporate disclosures. Investigators 

              are probing whether company officials withheld financial information 

              from investors who, along with employees in the company pension 

              plan, suffered huge losses in the firm's collapse.

            <p>"Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said of the Enron executive, 

              a generous donor to Bush's political campaigns. "But what anybody's 

              going to find is that this administration will fully investigate 

              issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn 

              from the past and make sure that workers are protected."

            <p>The latest twist in the Enron saga came one day after the Justice 

              Department launched a criminal probe of the company, investigating, 

              among other matters, whether Enron knew of problems but failed to 

              disclose them. In congressional testimony last month, the head of 

              Andersen said he had warned Enron that the company might be guilty 

              of "possible illegal acts" for withholding financial information 

              from auditors--an allegation Enron denied.

            <p>Andersen's destruction of records drew angry reactions from members 

              of Congress investigating the accounting methods used by the auditor.

            <p>Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) of the House Energy and Commerce 

              Committee called the loss "deeply troubling" and vowed to investigate.

            <p>"It should never have happened," Tauzin said. "Clearly this is 

              a very serious matter. Anyone who destroyed records simply out of 

              stupidity should be fired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally 

              to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted."

            <p>"The list of problems and problem people involved in this entire 

              tawdry affair seems destined to grow," said Rep. John D. Dingell 

              of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 

              "The seriousness of this matter cries out for further investigation."

            <p>Stephen Cutler, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's 

              enforcement division, called the record destruction an "extremely 

              serious matter" but added that it "will not deter us from pursuit 

              of our investigation and will be included within the scope of our 

              investigation."

            <p>The SEC is investigating whether Enron used loopholes in accounting 

              regulations to hide debt. In addition, Congress is looking into 

              Andersen's interpretation of accounting rules that allowed Enron 

              to exclude losses at several partnerships from its reporting. Enron 

              and Andersen dispute who is to blame for the faulty accounting.

            <p>On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million 

              and disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. On 

              Nov. 8, it announced it had overstated its earnings by $586 million 

              during the last four years, sending the company's stock tumbling 

              from more than $90 a share a year earlier to less than a dollar. 

              The meltdown cost more than 4,000 employees their jobs and destroyed 

              the retirement savings of employees with company-sponsored savings 

              plans.

            <p>Because, as the company said, the retirement plan was changing 

              administrators, those employees were locked out of selling their 

              shares at the time the stock began its most precipitous descent. 

              However, many executives managed to sell their shares just before 

              the stock's plunge.

            <p>The company filed for protection from its creditors Dec. 2.

            <p>At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called 

              O'Neill and Evans separately, reporting "his concerns about whether 

              or not Enron would be able to meet its obligations."

            <p>O'Neill said in the two calls he received--on Oct. 28 and Nov. 

              8, according to an aide--Lay expressed concern about the implications 

              for the capital markets and also that a possible downgrading of 

              the company's credit rating might ruin a pending merger prospect.

            <p>Lay did not ask for anything specific, O'Neill said. "As secretary 

              of the Treasury with responsibility for the U.S. capital markets, 

              I get calls every day from the big players in the world" warning 

              about important financial events, he told CNN.

            <p>But Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay did draw a comparison 

              with Long Term Capital Management, a large investment firm that 

              was saved from collapse in 1998 by a federally orchestrated private 

              bailout.

            <p>Lay "expressed a concern that if Enron went bankrupt, it would 

              affect the credit markets the way the Long Term Capital Management 

              problems a few years earlier affected the credit markets, that it 

              would have ripple effects throughout the whole banking sector," 

              she said.

            <p>Davis said O'Neill never discussed a bailout or any other kind 

              of aid for Enron.

            <p>Evans said Lay was hoping for high-level "support."

            <p>Fleischer said that the secretaries decided not to inform Bush 

              of the calls and that Bush did not learn of them until Thursday 

              morning.

            <p>Fleischer said Evans and O'Neill handled the matter appropriately. 

              Communication "is not a wrongdoing. What took place here was they 

              received phone calls and took no action."

            <p>However, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said the calls show 

              that the administration had advance word of Enron's collapse and 

              did nothing to protect shareholders or employees.

            <p>Fleischer dismissed the criticism as partisan rhetoric, "what people 

              have become so used to in Washington, which is a politically charged, 

              politically motivated effort to blame one party or to look only 

              at one party." Enron, he said, has given hundreds of thousands of 

              dollars to both parties.

            <p>Bush said he had not spoken with Lay about his company's financial 

              problems and had not seen him since last spring, when they met at 

              a Houston theater where the president's mother was the sponsor of 

              a book-reading fund-raiser by celebrity authors.

            <p>Lay was a so-called pioneer in Bush's presidential campaign, which 

              meant he committed to raising at least $100,000.

            <p>Lay also personally contributed more than $275,000 to the Republican 

              National Committee during the 2000 election cycle, part of overall 

              donations from company employees and directors to the RNC that exceeded 

              $1.1 million. Enron gave $100,000 to help pay for Bush's inauguration. 

              In that cycle, Enron employees and directors gave $530,000 to the 

              Democratic National Committee; Lay made no personal contributions 

              to the DNC.

            <p>In calling for an examination of the pension rules, Bush said he 

              directed O'Neill, Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to determine 

              "the effects of the current law on hard-working Americans and to 

              come up with recommendations of how to reform the system to make 

              sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as 

              the result of a bankruptcy, for example."

            <p>In addition, he said that O'Neill, along with the SEC, the Federal 

              Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would study 

              corporate disclosure rules and regulations in light of the Enron 

              bankruptcy.

            <p>"There needs to be a full review of disclosure rules to make sure 

              that the American stockholder, or any stockholder, is protected," 

              Bush said.

            <p>Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the 

              world's largest energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled 

              1 in 4 wholesale deals for electricity, gas and other energy products.

            <p>The company championed energy deregulation and tried to influence 

              the way California structured its energy markets and how the state 

              steered through its electricity crisis. It became a target of attacks 

              from politicians, regulators and consumer activists for its aggressive 

              business tactics.
