<p>US moves to launch a Middle East peace initiative were in chaos last night 

after a split between the president, George Bush, and the secretary of state, 

Colin Powell, burst into the open. 

<P>The White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, delivered a public rebuke to 

Mr Powell for floating proposals that included creation of a "temporary" Palestinian 

state. 

<P>He accused Mr Powell of parroting the ideas of foreign government leaders rather 

than reaching his own conclusions. 

<P>Against a background of continuing violence in Israel and the occupied territories, 

Mr Bush is to make a speech within days that is meant to revive the peace process. 

But Mr Bush and Mr Powell are divided over the content. 

<P>Mr Bush is leaning heavily towards the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, 

who was returning to Israel yesterday after two days of talks in Washington. Mr 

Powell appears to be more sympathetic towards the Palestinian position. 

<P>Mr Sharon broke his flight home to stop in London to brief Tony Blair on the 

US visit. In an hour-long discussion at Downing Street, Mr Blair pressed him to 

re-engage in the political process rather than rely solely on military solutions, 

according to a Downing Street spokesman. 

<P>An Israeli government spokesman said Mr Sharon had been explicit about the 

"terror" that Israel faced and had told Mr Blair that "any kind of political talks 

will have to follow the end of terror". 

<P>Britain is encouraging Israel to drop its pre-conditions to entering the political 

process: an end to Palestinian attacks on Israelis and reform of the Palestinian 

Authority. 

<P>But there is no prospect of political negotiations without impetus being provided 

by Washington, which was yesterday in a state of paralysis. 

<P>Mr Powell, in an interview with a London-based Arab paper, al-Hayat, floated 

a series of ideas, including the creation of the "temporary" Palestinian state, 

a halfway house on the way to full statehood. 

<P>Mr Powell echoed Arab demands for "the end of the occupation" of the West Bank 

and Gaza by Israel, for "the creation of a state called Palestine" and for "the 

end of settlement activity". 

<P>He said that Mr Bush will announce "in the very near future" how he intends 

to secure a Palestinian state. Next Monday has been penciled in for Mr Bush's 

speech but the timing could slip given the splits within the administration. 

<P>He said that Mr Bush had not ruled out setting a timetable for the creation 

of a Palestinian state. The Palestinians want the timetable but Mr Sharon is opposed. 

<P>Mr Powell also stressed the importance of holding an international conference, 

planned for this summer, to discuss the options for peace and, in contrast with 

Mr Bush and Mr Sharon, to continue to work with the Palestinian leader, Yasser 

Arafat. 

<P>"It's up to the Palestinian people to determine who their leader is, to determine 

who should head their government," Mr Powell said. 

<P>Hours after the interview was published, Mr Fleischer said Mr Powell's proposals 

would be treated as advice that Mr Bush may or may not heed. 

<P>Mr Fleischer said: "Welcome to the Middle East. This is a situation where people 

get a variety of information, a variety of advice and if the president has anything 

further to indicate, he will." 

<P>Mr Fleischer said the secretary of state was acting on advice he had heard 

from foreign leaders rather than stating his own conclusions. "The secretary, 

from time to time, will reflect on the advice that he gets and do so publicly, 

which is his prerogative." 

<P>Envoys from the Middle East "quartet" working on peace proposals are to meet 

in Washington tomorrow. The quartet is made up of the US, the UN, the EU, and 

Russia. The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, alarmed at the extent 

to which Mr Sharon's voice rather than the Arab one is being listened to in the 

US administration, is to hold talks in Washington today. 

<P>Mr Sharon appears to be satisfied with assurances he received from Mr Bush 

about plans for the Middle East. 

<P>Mr Bush and Mr Sharon are in agreement on marginalizing Mr Arafat and trying 

to find another Palestinian leader.
