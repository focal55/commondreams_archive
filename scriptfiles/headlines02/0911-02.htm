<p> WASHINGTON - A U.S. lawmaker said on Tuesday he was joining an unofficial 

delegation to Baghdad this week to show support for the Iraqi people and try to 

"cool this war rhetoric."

<p><a href="http://www.house.gov/rahall/" target="_new">Rep. Nick Rahall</a>, 

a 13-term West Virginia Democrat, said he strongly opposes Iraqi President Saddam 

Hussein but wants the United Nations to deal with him and does not want any U.S. 

action that will damage the international coalition "that President Bush has so 

effectively put together to fight terrorism."

<p>"I'm not going as Secretary of State. I'm not going as a  weapons inspector. I'm going as an individual who'd like to  cool this rhetoric and act in a calm matter, and show the Iraqi  people that the American people are not warmongers," he told  Reuters in a telephone interview.

<p>Rahall, who is of Lebanese descent, is leaving on Wednesday for a week-long 

trip with a delegation from the <a href="http://www.accuracy.org" target="_new">Institute 

for Public Accuracy</a>, a think tank with offices in Washington and San Francisco.

<p>Norman Solomon, executive director of the Institute for  Public Accuracy, said the trip is a "humanitarian effort."  "We'll be involved in dialogue and I should emphasize that  we're going as an independent delegation of Americans. There's  no group position that we're taking," Solomon said.<p>Rahall, a descendant of Lebanese peddlers who made their  way to West Virginia to sell their wares to coal miners, said  he wanted to "help illuminate the plight of the Iraqi people."<p>He said he hoped to stress upon the administration the need  for a much clearer explanation as to why there was a  "ratcheting up of the war rhetoric at this particular time."<p>Rahall who backed the first President Bush during the Gulf  War, said he agrees "Saddam must go" but he has "serious  questions" about the current U.S. policy.<p>"Why now, two months before an election? Why was the threat  so serious now that it wasn't a year ago. I've seen certainly  no link of Iraq to 9-11 ... I just don't see a linkage there."

<p>Rahall said the "true enemies" are al Qaeda, and that the focus should stay 

on that fight.
