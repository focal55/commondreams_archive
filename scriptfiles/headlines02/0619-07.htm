<p>LONDON -- While conservation groups are working hard and spending millions 

to save endangered species, their efforts are being undermined by organized gangs 

conducting a hybrid drug and wildlife trade. 

<p> Live snakes stuffed with condoms full of cocaine are shipped across borders; 

live snails packed with heroin travel by air. Drug money is laundered through 

pirate timber companies. 

<p> A new report from the World Wide Fund for Nature and its investigatory branch 

TRAFFIC, documents the lucrative links between the drug trade and the wildlife 

trade conducted by organized criminal gangs. 

<p> "There is evidence," the report says, "that organized crime elements are becoming 

increasingly involved in the most lucrative parts of the illegal trade and that 

they are prepared to use intimidation and violence." The report gives examples 

of wildlife wardens and border guards killed by organized and armed gangs. 

<p> Organized crime groups dealing in wildlife include Colombian drug cartels, 

Chinese Triad groups, the "red mafia" from the former Soviet Union who use violence 

to control the illegal trade in caviar, west African and West Indian groups. But, 

the conservationists found, "much illegal wildlife trading starts at the level 

of small networks which consist of fellow collectors/enthusiasts or family members." 

<p> Stuart Chapman, head of WWF-UK's species program said Monday, "This report 

confirms what many have suspected. The huge profits that can be made from wildlife 

trafficking are acting as a magnet to organized crime networks. The profits, sometimes 

worth up to 800 percent, combined with the low risks of detection and lack of 

serious punishment, make illegal wildlife trade very attractive to criminals." 

<p> "Ounce for ounce, wildlife products such as rhino horn or deer musk can be 

worth more than Class A drugs or gold," confirms a study into wildlife crime commissioned 

by the UK government and carried out by Wolverhampton University last year. 

<p> The WWF and TRAFFIC investigators found that about half the wildlife criminals 

prosecuted in the United Kingdom have previous convictions for drugs, violence, 

theft and firearms offenses, a pattern that they say shows up around the world. 

<p> In Brazil, recent estimates suggest that up to 40 percent of illegal drug 

shipments are combined with wildlife. 

<p> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that more than a third of cocaine 

seized in the United States in 1993 was associated with wildlife imports. 

<p> The report identifies five broad categories of activity: specialist specimen 

collecting; skins and furs, and traditional Asian medicines; activities linked 

to drug trafficking; caviar trafficking; and illegal timber trade. 

<p> "Each of these categories has its own often highly organized methods, markets, 

routes and tricks of the trade, which include concealment, misdeclaration, permit 

fraud and the laundering of illegal wildlife products through the complexities 

of re-exports. 

<p> The report details many links between illegal wildlife trade and organized 

crime. 

<p> Legal shipments of wildlife are used to conceal drugs as customs officers 

at Heathrow, discovered in 1996 while inspecting a consignment of live snails. 

They were packed with heroin. 

<p> In 1993, a U.S. Customs inspector in Miami noticed an unnatural bulge in a 

live boa constrictor that was part of a shipment of 312 animals from Colombia. 

Officers found cocaine filled condoms that had been inserted into 225 of the snakes. 

A total of 39 kilograms (86 pounds) of cocaine was recovered from the reptiles, 

which all died. 

<p> Venomous snakes are used by criminals to guard or conceal drug caches and 

consignments. 

<p> The same smuggling routes are used for drugs and wildlife. In Latin America, 

WWF and TRAFFIC report, powerful drug cartels operate in countries where many 

endangered species are found, and use their covert distribution networks to profitably 

trade in these species as well as drugs. 

<p> The money from drug dealing is laundered by setting up trading businesses 

such as illegal logging operations. 

<p> Wildlife products are used as a currency to barter for drugs, and to launder 

drug traffic money. Planeloads of smuggled birds from Australia have been exchanged 

for heroin in Bangkok, with the drugs being flown back to Australia for sale, 

the groups report. 

<p> Despite the level of seriousness of these offenders, wildlife crime offenses 

are often not taken seriously by those who make and implement the law - whether 

in the UK, European Union or global context. The level of enforcement "fails to 

reflect the potential global threat they pose to biodiversity," say WWF and TRAFFIC. 

<p> In April 2002, the UK government created the National Wildlife Crime Intelligence 

Unit, but the conservation groups say while this is a step forward, it is not 

enough to stop the trafficking in wildlife or drugs. 

<p> "Although this will gather vital information on markets, criminals and networks, 

the enforcers will remain powerless to arrest criminals for wildlife trade offenses 

involving critically endangered species unless the penalties are increased," WWF 

and TRAFFIC say. 

<p> The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) assessment of the UK market 

for endangered species and the involvement of organized criminality in wildlife 

crime conducted in 2001 concludes that wildlife crime, including international 

smuggling of endangered species, is on the increase. 

<p> It is attractive to organized crime groups, especially those with smuggling 

capabilities, due to the combination of low risks, weak penalties, and high profits, 

the NCIS found. 

<p> "The most significant wildlife crimes involve the taking and keeping of species 

within the UK and especially the trafficking in endangered species," said the 

NCIS report. 

<p> Crawford Allan, TRAFFIC's global enforcement coordinator, agrees. "We believe 

the main problems in the UK are a lack of investment in wildlife law enforcement 

and the minimal punishments under wildlife trade laws that do not act as a deterrent 

to criminals," he said Monday. 

<p> The conservation groups are calling for maximum penalties of five years for 

wildlife crimes, which will make it possible for authorities to arrest people 

suspected of these offenses.
