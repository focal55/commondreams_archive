<p>Women protesters who have besieged an oil terminal in southern Nigeria for 

more than a week say they will continue their blockade. 

<P>Earlier, it seemed as if a deal to resolve the situation could be close.

documentation from the company offering local residents jobs, schools, water, 

electricity and other amenities. (AP Photo/Saurabh Das)<br>

</table></font>However the women said negotiators for the Chevron oil company were not "sincere" and were not committing themselves to anything by way of agreement. 

<P> One of the women told the BBC's Robert Efenakpo that they will remain at the 

terminal until the company is ready to discuss the situation.



<FONT FACE="sans-serif" SIZE="2"> Our correspondent says the protesters, who are 

supported by their menfolk, are very determined. 

<P> The women say that Chevron may have agreed to employ youths from their community, 

but that the oil giant did not give any numbers. 

<P> They say the multinational has not specified either how it is going to go 

about providing the amenities it has promised in the framework of the deal.

</table>U-turn</B> 

<P> Earlier on Tuesday, one of the protest leaders, Anunu Uwawah, told the Associated 

Press news agency: "It is settled. We stay today, but once the paper is signed, 

we will leave." 

<P> She said the firm - Chevron Nigeria - had satisfied the women's demands by 

agreeing to hire more than two dozen villagers and build schools, water systems 

and other amenities. </FONT> 

<P> About 800 workers remain trapped in the Escravos terminal in southern Delta 

state, after about 400 workers were allowed to leave the site on Sunday. 

<P> Some 150 women took over the terminal eight days ago, demanding employment 

for their families and investment in the local community. 

<P> The occupation of the terminal has halted the production of an estimated 500,000 

barrels of oil a day.

</TABLE>Company pledge</B> 

<P> An executive of parent company Chevron Texaco, Dick Filgate, said he hoped 

the deal would be finalized by Tuesday, the news agency reported. 

<P> According to Mr Filgate, the company has agreed to build a town hall in the 

village of Ugborodo - home to many of the protesters - and build schools and power 

and water systems. 

<P> "We now have a different philosophy, and that is do more with communities," 

AP quoted Mr Filgate as saying following talks with the women. 

<P> He said the deal would be reviewed in five years' time. 

<P> As part of their protest, the women have also threatened to strip naked in 

a traditional gesture of shaming men if no satisfactory deal is reached. 

<P> Many Nigerian tribes consider displays of nudity by wives, mothers and grandmothers 

as a damning protest and an act that shames all those it is aimed at. 

<P> Nigeria is Africa's largest oil-producer but protests are common in oil-producing 

regions by local communities, demanding that more of the oil wealth is used for 

their benefit. 

<P> Locals often kidnap workers and demand ransom money from oil companies. </p>
