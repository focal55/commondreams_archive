<p>France's most prominent anti-globalization activist Jose Bove, jailed for tearing down a half-built McDonald's franchise in 1999, was released from prison.</p>

<p>A smiling but visibly thinner Bove -- who observed a hunger strike for nearly a month, until July 14 -- was surrounded Thursday by his attorneys, his partner Ghislaine and officials from his Confederation Paysanne farmers' union.</p>

</table></font>The activist sharply criticized prison conditions in France, telling some 1,000 supporters: "A country that allows this is not worthy of being the nation of human rights."</p>

<p>He described the situation for detainees as "not only a loss of liberty, but also the actual denial of a person's existence as a human being."</p>

<p>Bove -- known for his opposition to multinational companies and US trade policies -- went to jail on June 19 to serve a three-month sentence in Villeneuve-les-Maguelone, a suburb outside the southern city of Montpellier.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday, he signed papers cutting four weeks off his jail term -- two for good behavior and two linked to a national post-election pardon granted by President Jacques Chirac.</p>

<p>Members of Confederation Paysanne, the Greens party and anti-globalization groups welcomed Bove, and planned to stage a celebratory picnic and protest against genetically modified foods some 600 meters (yards) from the prison.</p>

<p>Bove's rise to fame at home and abroad began when he and a group of other farmers used tractors to tear apart a McDonald's outlet under construction in the southern town of Millau in 1999.</p>

<p>Successive courts rejected his argument that he was making a legitimate protest against junk food and punitive US tariffs on French cheeses.</p>

<p>His incarceration was put off until the end of presidential and parliamentary elections between April and June, which saw Chirac re-elected and his center-right supporters winning a wide parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>Bove arrived to serve his sentence here on his tractor -- a seven-hour journey made at a snail's pace that swelled into a parade of around 1,000 supporters, journalists and cameramen.</p>

<p>The activist still faces another 14 months behind bars for a separate incident 

in which he and other campaigners destroyed a field of genetically modified crops.</p>
