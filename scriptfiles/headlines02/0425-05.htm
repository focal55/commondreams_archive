BERKELEY -- 

A pro-Palestinian group that took over a building at the University of 

California at Berkeley this month has been suspended from campus under what 

officials called a crackdown on academic disruptions.

<P>Campus administrators have also told 41 students arrested when the group 

<a href="http://www.justiceinpalestine.org/" target="_new">Students for Justice in Palestine</a> occupied Wheeler Hall that they may be 

suspended for as long as a year.

<P>"We never had tolerated disruptions of the academy, but what has changed is 

that the sanctions have changed," Karen Kenney, director of student activities 

and services, said yesterday.

<P>Before, she said, "students didn't face some form of suspension for cite-

and-release arrests."

<P>The action means the group is barred from holding demonstrations on campus, 

having an information table or handing out leaflets while the university 

investigates the April 9 protest, during which 79 people were arrested.

<P>Hoang Phan, 25, one of those arrested, said the group had just been acting 

out the UC Berkeley tradition of civil disobedience.

<P>"We have a Free Speech Movement Cafe on campus. We have the Mario Savio 

steps," Phan said. "We were making clear our political message. Our event did 

not threaten anyone. There was no property destruction. We didn't lock it down 

-- the police locked down the building."

<P><b>ZERO WARNING</b>

<P>Students from the pro-Palestinian group said campus officials had declared 

the zero-tolerance policy right before their protest, and they concluded that 

it was aimed specifically at them. Kenney, however, said UC Berkeley officials 

had merely strengthened an existing policy after a series of disruptive 

incidents.

<P>Students for Justice in Palestine also took over Wheeler Hall last April to 

push for the university to divest its holdings in Israel, and campus 

administrators warned them they would face sanctions if they disrupted classes 

during their latest protest, Kenney said.

<P>The students who were arrested this month have been referred to the Student 

Conduct Office and will go through a disciplinary process. If the arrested 

students dispute the charges, a committee of students, faculty and 

administrators can hold a hearing and recommend sanctions to Kenney.

<P>Other groups have been suspended from campus for protests that disrupted 

classes, Kenney said. A pro-affirmative action organization, By Any Means 

Necessary, was suspended for several weeks last year after a rally turned into 

a near-riot.

<P>"It is standard procedure if a student group violates campus rules," 

Assistant Chancellor John Cummins said. "The takeover of an academic building 

is a serious violation."

<P><b>RALLY PLANNED FOR MAY</b>

<P>The university's action may not keep the group's members from staging more 

anti-Israel demonstrations. Some members of Students for Justice in Palestine 

have already signed up with the International Socialist Organization to hold 

another rally in early May.

<P>"In the end, the university can't stop us from exercising our freedom of 

speech because there are many more people on campus who feel the way we do," 

said William Youmans, 24, a law student and a member of Students for Justice 

in Palestine.

<P>The group, which has chapters on college campuses across the country, has 

held several protests at Berkeley over the past year, including one in which 

it erected a mock military checkpoint and herded students into "refugee camps."</p>
