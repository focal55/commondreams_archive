without legal representation. 

<P> Nabil al-Marabh was one of hundreds of men swept up in the nationwide terrorism 

investigation.

Few have spoken about their detention and none as high profile as Mr al-Marabh.

<P>

After 11 months of exhaustive investigations, no evidence of any involvement in terrorism has been presented to the courts. 

<P>The 35-year-old, born in Kuwait,  was the subject of an FBI manhunt. 

<P>



He is due to be sentenced any day on a relatively minor border violation. 

<P>

He pleaded guilty in July to trying to cross the US border illegally. 

<P>

As he awaits likely deportation and separation from his family, Mr al-Marabh has decided to speak about his time in detention.

<P>

<B>'Worse than hell'</B>

			</font></td></tr></table>For the first eight months Mr al-Marabh was held in a special unit at New 

York's Metropolitan Detention Center, along with, he said, 40 other detainees. 

<P> Speaking from custody elsewhere in the state, he told me he was held in isolation 

and went on hunger strike in protest against his confinement in a tiny cell. 

<P> "It was like nothing worse than hell and I did five times hunger strikes, 

asking for a lawyer, for a judge," said Mr al-Marabh. 

<P> He says that he was punished for his hunger strikes, forced to sleep on a 

urine soaked mattress for 10 days, without enough water to wash himself. 

<P> He also alleged that he was beaten twice. 

<P> The first incident, he said, was last November. 

<P> "On 7 November they beat me, they hid everything and then they refused to 

take any notes, they crack my finger and they beat my head. 

<P> "It's been too hard, I've been taking medication. My brain is not functioning 

any more, I forget a lot and I get shocks at night because they used to bang the 

door and they never let us sleep." 

<P> <B>'Terror links'</B> 

<P> Nabil al-Marabh was just one of about 1,200 people arrested in the aftermath 

of 11 September. 

<P> But unlike most of the others, Mr al-Marabh was suspected of having major 

terrorist connections.

<P> Prosecutors believed they had identified a mass of evidence. 

<P> For instance, they say Mr al-Marabh had been in Afghanistan, that he had lived 

at many addresses in America and that he had amassed an array of forged documents. 

<P> But perhaps most crucially, they say he had links to a man, Raed Hijazi, now 

convicted of plotting to bomb a tourist hotel in Jordan. 

<P> Prosecutors claimed Hijazi was linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network. 

<P> Mr al-Marabh told me he knew Hijazi but had no idea about his background. 

<P> As for Afghanistan, he said: "I was in Afghanistan working with the Muslim 

World League. I was working in the humanity agency to go and help homelessness 

and refugees. 

<P> "I never killed anyone, I'm just regular normal person, I'm innocent. I got 

nothing to do with any terrorist activities." 

<P> The Justice Department said they could not give us any details about Mr al-Marabh's 

case. 

<P> The FBI would not comment either. 

<P> <B>Human rights</B> 

<P> None of the detainees, it's believed, has so far been charged with any terrorism 

offences. 

<P> It is clear that for the authorities, harboring suspicions is very different 

from being able to prove them. 

<P> Nabil Mr al-Marabh's case has come to symbolize the tensions between America's 

need to protect itself and respect for human rights. 

<P> The human rights group Amnesty International has been investigating allegations 

from a number of detainees. 

<P> It found that many individuals had been held in prolonged solitary confinement 

with little legal representation. 

<P> The Justice Department's Inspector General is also investigating the treatment 

of the so-called 11 September detainees. 

<P> As for Nabil Mr al-Marabh, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Detention Center 

said that all the inmates were treated in a fair, impartial and consistent manner, 

and that any allegations were taken seriously. 

<P> Mr al-Marabh will have spent more time in custody than most of the other suspects, 

but there are still believed to be 146 other detainees waiting to hear their fate.
