SYDNEY  - Refugee activists called for rallies

around Australia on Sunday to protest at the government's

treatment of asylum seekers as detainees continued hunger

strikes and attempted suicides at an outback refugee camp.

<p>An Immigration Department spokesman said an illegal

immigrant who had thrown himself onto a razor wire fence at the

controversial Woomera detention center on Saturday was being

monitored in hospital but gave no details about his condition.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

Protestors, with their mouths taped shut, rally in Sydney. The protestors taped their mouths as a symbolic gesture of support for illegal immigrants at the Woomera detention center who have sewn their lips together. A senior government advisor on immigration quit over Australia's hardline treatment of refugees, dealing Canberra an embarrassing blow on Wednesday as the lip-sewing protests and hunger strikes by detained asylum seekers escalated.

</table></font>The detainee who tried to escape from the camp, located

under the baking sun of the desert 295 miles north of Adelaide,

was one of 200 asylum seekers who staged a violent protest at

the months it takes to process refugee claims.<p>``One detainee is in...hospital being monitored by medical

staff and receiving appropriate treatment,'' the spokesman said.<p>He added that three children had been taken to hospital

overnight for observation as almost 200 Woomera inmates

continued a hungerstrike for a 12th straight day. Some have

tried to hang themselves and others have swallowed shampoo and

painkillers.<p>Refugee groups on Sunday planned to hold demonstrations in

Sydney and Melbourne in sympathy for the illegal immigrants at

Woomera, some 35 of whom still had their mouths symbolically

sewn shut with a strand of thread.<p>``This just shows the level of desperation, these people

just got nothing to lose, they are throwing themselves on razor

wire,'' said Judy McVey of the Refugee Action Collective in

Melbourne.<p>She said 200 people would rally outside the Maribyrnonga

detention center in the southern city where dozens of asylum

seekers and visa overstayers have staged a sympathy

hungerstrike.<p>In Sydney, activists planned a demonstration outside the

Villawood detention center and detainees there said they would

also start to refuse food and water.<p>The protests have already spread to the Curtin refugee camp

in Western Australia as the government's policy of detaining

all illegal immigrants spirals into an international

embarrassment.<p>The government has refused to bow to what it calls moral

blackmail and insists it will not be at fault if people die.<p>PRESSURE MOUNTS<p>But pressure has been mounting on conservative Prime

Minister John Howard, who won re-election in November partly on

a tough stand against boatpeople, to show more compassion for

the asylum seekers, many of whom have fled war and repression.<p>Saturday was Australia Day, commemorating the colonization

of the Australian continent by the British in 1788, and

commentators urged the country to remember it was founded on

immigration.<p>``The Australia I wanted to celebrate yesterday is a

fair-minded, tolerant place, where everyone's given a fair go,''

wrote Sue Williams in Sunday's Sydney Morning Herald.<p>``Instead, I found myself in a country that a few

politicians, through a pungent blend of myopia, thirst for

power, idiocy and breathtaking lack of any sort of compassion

whatsoever, have been allowed carelessly to poison and trash.''<p>At Woomera, where around 900 illegal immigrants are housed

in a camp set up on a former rocket range, security guards on

Saturday night ordered the media to move out of sight.<p>An Australian Broadcasting Corp journalist was arrested

when she refused as the government tries to draw a veil over

the camp.<p>The government's hard line, and a policy of intercepting

all new boatpeople at sea with warships and shipping them to

camps it has paid Pacific islands to set up, enjoys broad

public support.<p>But the first cracks have begun to appear, with opposition

center-left Labor, which had previously backed the policy, on

Saturday urging the government to free detained children.

<p>Around 8,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Australia over

the past two years, a trickle according to the United Nations.

<p>But the island continent of just 19.3 million people also

takes 10,000 refugees a year formally resettled under a U.N.

program and another 50,000 permanent migrants.
