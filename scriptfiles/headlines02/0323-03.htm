Washington  --

The Bush administration has asked Congress to allow the Colombian 

government to use past anti-drug contributions of helicopters, planes, 

gunboats and other equipment in its expanding campaign against guerrilla 

groups, officials said yesterday.

The administration has previously signaled that it would ask Congress to 

allow new aid to be used for "counterterrorism" activities, as well as for the 

anti-drug effort. But, in a supplemental budget request submitted this week, 

the administration seeks to further leverage the efforts against the rebels by 

loosening restrictions on past aid as well.

<P>The supplemental budget request that includes the unfettering of past aid 

also seeks $35 million in new funding for the current year. The sum would be 

in addition to $435 million the administration already requested for Colombia 

for fiscal 2003.

<P>"This is big," said Adam Isacson, a Latin American expert at the Center for 

International Policy, a center-left think tank in Washington.

<P>Congressional aides of the two major U.S. parties expect a fight over the 

proposal this spring because some lawmakers fear that broadening military aid 

could mire the United States in a conflict that has raged for 38 years.

<P>Critics say the budget request language permitting use of the money for 

"counterterrorism" defines its purpose so broadly that the Colombian 

government "could use it for almost anything," in the words of one aide.

Shinseki is in Colombia for two days to review the anti-narcotic programs and the Plan Colombia. With Colombia on the verge of a bloodier phase of civil war, the Bush Administration  asked Congress to end restrictions that limit U.S. military assistance to Colombia to counter-narcotics activities.

</font>Bush administration aides have been arguing that the United States needs to 

quickly step up the battle against the two main Colombian rebel groups, the 

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army. The 

leftist guerrillas are battling Colombian government forces and right-wing 

paramilitary groups.

<P>U.S. officials contend that the United States should intervene because the 

groups pose a threat to an allied democracy and to Americans directly.

<P>Administration officials maintain that past U.S. policy, which tried to 

limit aid to the anti-drug effort, was unrealistic because the rebels have 

turned to drug trafficking to fund their insurgency.

<P>U.S. aid to Colombia has been allocated to a variety of purposes, including 

building the country's economy and developing its democratic institutions. But 

the U.S. anti-drug aid has bought military equipment that could be used 

against the rebels.

<P>The United States has appropriated money to provide about 75 helicopters 

for the Colombian military, according to analyst Isacson, although not all of 

those are now ready for operations. He said the United States has also bought 

about a dozen helicopters for the Colombian police and has provided fixed-wing 

aircraft with sophisticated sensors, and some river gunboats that are armed 

with machine guns.</P>
