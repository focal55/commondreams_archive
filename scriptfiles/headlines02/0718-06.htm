The numbers, in a department letter written to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., are the 

first accounting of the magnitude of closed-door legal proceedings conducted as 

part of new, sweeping anti-terrorism laws, civil-rights advocates said yesterday. 

<P> The numbers, they say, raise questions about how well the government has targeted 

its terrorism probe and whether hundreds have been deported without due process. 

<P> An official in Attorney General John Ashcroft's Justice Department said yesterday 

that hearings are closed and information about them is limited to protect the 

privacy of detainees and the terrorism investigation. 

<P> "This information, if made public, could let the terrorists know things we 

don't want them to know," department spokesman Mark Corallo said. 

<P> Kary Moss, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) 

in Michigan, said she thinks most of the people subject to the hearings are facing 

deportation. 

<P> "I don't think we had any idea that this number of people had been subjected 

to closed hearings," she said. 

<P> "The implications are very serious. If none of these people have been charged 

with any criminal-law violations, then John Ashcroft has essentially, on his own, 

created two systems of justice in this country." 

<P> Levin, in his role as chairman of the permanent subcommittee on investigations, 

asked the department in March for a detailed accounting of terrorism detainees. 

<P> "It took the Justice Department more than three months to produce a partial 

response to my letter," Levin said this week. But it "raises a number of additional 

questions, including why closed hearings were necessary for so many people," Levin 

said. He said he plans to press the department for more answers. 

<P> In a July 3 letter to Levin, Assistant Attorney General Daniel Bryant said 

that, as of May 29, 611 individuals detained by the Immigration and Naturalization 

Service (INS) had had at least one closed hearing. 

<P> The letter, although short on many details requested by Levin, offered a rare 

glimpse of the government's anti-terrorism efforts that previously were only guessed 

at or gathered in bits and pieces. 

<P> In the early months of the investigation, Justice Department officials said 

that up to 1,200 people had been detained nationally. But the letter says 752 

individuals had been detained by the INS in connection with the terror probe, 

and 611 of those had secret hearings. 

<P> It's unclear why there is a discrepancy between the detainee numbers, and 

that's one of the questions Levin wants answered. The INS still has 81 people 

in custody, according to the letter. 

<P> The most striking element of the investigation, immigration and legal experts 

said, was the number of closed hearings. 

<P> Aside from hearings for asylum seekers, which are closed for privacy reasons 

and can be open if the asylum seeker requests it, most immigration court hearings 

are open to the public, immigration lawyers said. 

<P> But that changed after Sept. 11. Immigrants with visa violations who were 

arrested allegedly in connection to the terrorist attacks were designated "special 

interest" detainees. 

<P> Hearings were closed to their families and the public by an order from Chief 

U.S. Immigration Judge Michael Creppy on Sept. 21. Creppy issued the order at 

the behest of Ashcroft, who has been criticized for damaging civil rights in his 

effort to root out terrorists. 

<P> Two major lawsuits &#151; including one brought by the Detroit Free Press, 

other newspapers and the ACLU &#151; challenged Creppy's directive. 

<P> In April, U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds ruled in Detroit that the closed 

hearings were unconstitutional and ordered the secret INS hearings of Ann Arbor, 

Mich., charity fund-raiser Rabih Haddad be opened. The government appealed the 

ruling. Appeal arguments will be heard by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 

in Cincinnati on Aug. 6. 

<P> Haddad's charity has been accused of funding terrorist organizations, but 

he's being held on visa violations. 

<P> Even activists who have been fighting to open the closed hearings said they 

had no idea there were so many. Some say the government is cloaking its activities 

out of embarrassment. 

<P> Men once portrayed as strong links to the al-Qaida terrorist network now are 

being charged with minor visa violations and deported. 

<P> "It turned out these people are not criminals, they are not terrorists," said 

Imad Hamad, Midwestern regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 

Committee. "Yes, they are in violation of certain immigration rules &#151; which 

before Sept. 11 was not a reason to be dumped out of the country." 

<P>Public oversight is important because abuses happen when nobody is watching, 

said Lee Gelernt, senior staff counsel for the national ACLU's Immigrants' Rights 

Project. 

<P>"It is difficult to overstate the importance of public scrutiny of the INS 

process," Gelernt said, "where detainees are facing a trained prosecutor, often 

without counsel, and the outcome of the hearing will literally determine whether 

they are locked up for months, and then deported."
