<p>India and Pakistan conducted tit-for-tat missile tests yesterday. Pakistan 

tested a nuclear-capable surface-to-surface missile able to hit most targets in 

India. Within hours, Delhi tested its most sophisticated surface-to-air missile 

meant to bolster its air defense.</p>

<p>With more than one million soldiers deployed along the border, and daily saber-rattling 

from Delhi and Islamabad, the missile tests threaten to escalate tension in a 

region that is one step from the brink.</p>

<p>Pakistan warned that India, by conducting a test on the same day as its own, 

threatened to launch an arms race in South Asia. Both countries tested underground 

nuclear devices in 1998, and both say they have inducted nuclear weapons into 

their arsenals. But it is not known how many nuclear weapons either country possesses, 

or whether they have the nuclear warheads to attach to their missile stocks.</p>

<p>"India is trying to go into an arms race," the Pakistani Information Minister, 

Nisar Memon, said. But India said the testing of its domestically built Akash 

missile was routine. "We have been testing different parameters of the missile 

for the past fortnight," a Defense. Ministry spokesman said. "The missile is meant 

for air defense. It will be used by the army and air force."</p>

<p>Both countries notified the other of their plans to test. Pakistan declared 

its test a success and insisted it was not intended to inflame tensions. "It has 

nothing to do with anything, but to test the technical aspect of the missile," 

a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

<p>Shireen Mazari, the head of Pakistan's Institute of Strategic Studies, said 

the military preparedness is such in South Asia that the only place to go if there 

is an escalation is war. "As long as the troops remain at that level of readiness 

on our border, you can't afford to ignore it," she said. "India has raised the 

tension to just below actually fighting a war. There isn't much more they can 

do but go to war."</p>

<p>India dismissed Pakistan's test as a publicity stunt ahead of next week's general 

elections, the first in Pakistan since the military seized power in 1999. "This 

particular test is clearly targeted at the forthcoming general elections in Pakistan," 

an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

<p>Military analysts in Pakistan say the testing is part of a dangerous pattern. 

"We are not doing anything new. But what is unfortunate is that both countries 

engage in these tit-for-tat actions," said Talad Masood, a retired general. "As 

long as we both keep doing this it won't help to lower tensions in the region."</p>
