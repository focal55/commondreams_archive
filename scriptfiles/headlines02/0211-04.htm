GENEVA   - 

The United States and Britain are

weakening a global pact against child soldiers by insisting on

being able to recruit youths under 18 into their armed forces,

a leading activist said Monday.

<p>

A treaty effectively banning anyone under 18 from being

drafted into an army or rebel force, or taking part in

fighting, comes into force Tuesday following its ratification

by the required number of signatory states.

<p>

But the treaty, signed by 94 countries, including Britain

and the United States, lets states recruit youths below that

age providing they offer their services voluntarily.

<p>

"The hypocrisy of the United States and Britain is one of

the most disappointing aspects of this question," said Rory

Mungoven, coordinator of the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child

Soldiers.

<p>

Mungoven, who was in Geneva to attend a ceremony Tuesday to

mark the treaty's taking effect, said London and Washington had

played a key role in ensuring the 18-year rule did not apply

across the board when the pact was approved after long

negotiation in 2000.

<p>

He said that in some parts of the world, the distinction

between voluntary and forced recruitment was difficult to draw

and this would make it harder to monitor the treaty.

<p>

"It weakens the force of the...protocol. The line between

voluntary and forced can be blurred," he told reporters.

<p>

The new pact is a protocol because it takes the form of new

commitments attached to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of

the Child under which the minimum fighting age was 15.

<p>

Britain, Belgium, Canada, India and Australia are among

states allowing young people to join their armed forces at 16,

even if they are bound by their treaty obligations to do their

utmost to keep them away from any fighting.

<p>

The United States is one of a number of states that will

take volunteers at 17.

<p>

"They say that it is alright for us to recruit because we

will do it responsibly. But there has to be one standard for

all," Mungoven said.

<p>

He added that around 100 members of Britain's armed forces

under the age of 18 had been killed in the past decade. Most of

the deaths were in training, but some had come in fighting.

<p>

The Coalition, an umbrella alliance of human rights groups,

including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and

regional non-governmental organizations (NGOs), estimates that

half a million children -- those below 18 -- currently form

part of armed forces.

<p>

Of this total, some 300,000 are involved in fighting, much

of it in Africa, according to figures released last June.

<p>

The protocol, which has been ratified by 14 countries,

comes into force three months after being ratified by the 10th

signatory state.
