<p>BRITAIN deliberately bombed German civilians during the war, setting ablaze 

cities, schools and churches, according to a new book that shatters a 50-year 

taboo in Germany “Terrible crimes were committed, yet no one could talk about 

them,” the historian Jörg Friedrich, author of <I>Der Brand</I> (<I>The Fire</I>), 

says. “How could we raise these issues when weighed against the German-inflicted 

horrors of the concentration camps? How could we point a finger at the British 

and Americans who were feeding us and teaching us democracy?” The book, serialized 

in the mass circulation <I>Bild</I> newspaper and promoted with television interviews, 

has now broken that silence. 

<P>His arguments are familiar to British historians, who have long considered 

the case for and against Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris. But the German debate 

has concentrated almost exclusively so far on the bombing of Dresden — a largely 

non-military city famed for its architecture that was laid waste in February 1945 

at a time when the war was almost over. Dr Friedrich says that Dresden was not 

an isolated misjudgment but the last act in a devastating, largely unchronicled, 

war against German civilians. 

<P>Dr Friedrich, who has published several books on Nazi aggression, trawled through 

the archives of 70 cities to piece together the misery inflicted by the Allied 

bombing campaign. More than one million tonnes of explosives were dropped on 1,000 

German towns and villages during the war; 635,000 people died, most burnt to death 

or suffocated by toxic fumes. 

<P>He interviewed survivors who had had to collect the bodies that had shrunk 

in the flames. “The carbonated corpses shriveled to around 50 centimeters,” said 

Heinrich Bierg, from Wuppertal, who was 16 at the end of the war. “We had to store 

them in zinc baths or washing tubs. Three fitted in a tub, seven or eight in a 

bath.” 

<P>The sheer accumulation of detail has shocked Germans. Trude Walther, a 20-year-old 

student, wept into her coffee as she read the paper outside a Berlin bakery yesterday. 

“I never knew,” she said. 

<P>The stories come after recent disclosures of the vast number of rapes of German 

women by Soviet Army soldiers, and a new novel by Günter Grass about the bombing 

of the German refugee ship <I>Wilhelm Güstoff</I> towards the end of the War. 

<P>Germans, who have been told by Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor, that they 

are again a “normal country” unshackled by the past, increasingly see themselves 

as victims of war. Previously, only right-wing fringe publications shunned by 

ordinary people dared to make such a claim. Citizens directly affected rarely 

talked about the subject. 

<P>School history lessons barely mentioned the Allied bombing campaign and, as 

the late W.G. Sebald, the German scholar, noted in a first attempt to break the 

silence, no German novels on the subject were published. Professor Sebald’s research 

threw light on some of the horrors, such as women carrying their dead babies in 

suitcases for months after a bombing attack. 

<P>Novels about the tragedies are emerging only now. This week sees the publication 

of Dieter Forte’s <I>Silence or Speech</I>, in which his own memories of the Düsseldorf 

bombing are expressed. “The water used by the fire services was boiling from the 

heat of the firestorm,” Forte recalls, “so when they tried to douse the flames 

in the bunkers they boiled those sheltering there. When they realized what was 

happening, the firemen decided to let the bunkers burn. For a child who believed 

in the fire service, that was the worst thing — seeing them stand by and do nothing.” 

<P>Yet the documentary research by Dr Friedrich is having the most impact. The 

British and Americans, he says, chose the historic hearts of 161 cities such as 

Cologne, Nuremberg and Hanover as targets, knowing that the timber frames would 

burn quickly. They could not bomb military or industrial sites precisely enough 

without being shot down. 

<P>“Quickly it became clear to the strategists of the anti-Hitler alliance that 

the Second World War could not be won by exclusively military targeting,” Dr Friedrich 

said. “That is why Churchill ordered the carpet-bombing of German towns.”
