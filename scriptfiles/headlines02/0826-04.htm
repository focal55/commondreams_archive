<p>Deep tensions between Britain and the US have emerged ahead of the Earth Summit 

in Johannesburg, which remains shrouded in pessimism ahead of its official start 

today. 

<P>The summit is aimed at reducing world poverty through promoting environmentally 

sustainable growth, and although it is seen as the most important world summit 

for years, there are growing concerns that virtually nothing significant will 

be achieved. 

<P>As the gloom deepened in the corridors, it seems many delegates are staying 

away. Although 65,000 delegates had been predicted to turn up, the UN has downgraded 

its expectations to just 40,000, and by yesterday only 9,000 delegates and journalists 

had been accredited. 

<P>Last night it also emerged that inspite of the extra 8,000 police on duty, 

that a shot had been fired at a Swiss delegate in an attempted robbery in a hotel. 

It followed the earlier robbery on Saturday night of another delegate in a nearby 

room. 

<P>The UK has backed calls from developing countries for targets to reduce the 

number of people who don’t have access to drinking water, sanitation or electricity. 

The UN has warned that unless real progress is made, the world will be increasingly 

divided between haves and have nots, fueling global terrorism. 

<P>However, the US yesterday made clear that it does not want any new targets 

and will not provide any new money to reduce poverty or help protect the environment. 

The head of the US delegation John Turner said yesterday: “We don’t see the need 

for any new targets.” 

<P>Although 100 world leaders have said they will attend the summit, President 

Bush has said he will not attend. The head of the British delegation, the Environment 

Secretary Margaret Beckett, yesterday showed growing frustration with American 

intransigence, which could derail the summit. She said: “It’s true that the American 

government is not doing as much as we would all like to see it do, but that’s 

doesn’t mean there aren’t lots of people in America who take these issues just 

as seriously as they deserve”. 

<P>“We very much want to see targets on issues like sanitation. We hope to persuade 

our American friends to agree to some of the targets” she added. 

<P>After a year of talks, no agreement has been reached on more than a quarter 

of the negotiating text, and there is concern that positions are now so entrenched 

that it will be impossible to reach any meaningful agreement in the ten days of 

the summit. One UN official warned that failure to resolve outstanding issues 

could render the summit useless, and said they were not optimistic about progress. 

<P>“We hope to make some headway by the start of the summit. So far, what we forsee 

is a complete disaster” he said. 

<P>South Africa’s deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad, insisted that while he was 

confident that common ground could be reached, “it would be romantic to assume 

that there would be absolute consensus at such a large-diverse conference.” 

<P>Tony Juniper, director-designate of Friends of the Earth, said that there was 

now little chance of the summit achieving anything significant. “I think it’s 

looking like we’re going to get a pretty modest set of outcomes. It’s clear that 

we’re going to get no legally binding targets” he said. Friends of the Earth has 

been very critical of Tony Blair’s decision to attend the summit for just one 

day. 

<P>Mr Blair also came under attack from his most senior environment adviser, Jonathan 

Porritt, who said he didn’t give environmental issues the priority they deserve. 

Yesterday Mrs Beckett defended the Prime Minister, saying he had been fully involved 

in the summit. “The idea that all he brings to the summit is the time he spends 

here is crazy. He’s been working on it for 18 months - he’s been engaged and involved 

in it all the way through” she said. 

<P>Mrs Beckett also insisted that it would be a disaster if the delegates let 

the growing row with Zimbabwe’s President, Robert Mugabe, to overshadow the summit. 

Mr Blair had been facing calls to boycott a speech by Mr Mugabe, who will be attending 

the summit at the same time as Mr Blair. “The most important and crucial thing 

is to make sure the summit is not dominated by the issue of Robert Mugabe. There 

is nothing President Mugabe would like better than to think a whole world summit 

has been hijacked by his behavior and his concerns” said Mrs Beckett. 

<P>The start of the summit has already been overshadowed by the highly televised 

clash between protestors and police in the center of Johannesburg. Activists claimed 

that police, who fired stun grenades at a candle-lit demonstration which included 

children, were being heavy handed. However, Johannesburg’s Police Director Happy 

Schutter defended their action, saying that the marchers had not obtained permission. 

“We had to show them we wouldn’t let this happen during the summit. If they want 

to march they must get permission” he said. 

<P>The South African government has been worried that the summit could be as disrupted 

by protests as earlier summits such as Genoa, and have drafted in tens of thousands 

of police from surrounding areas. The Sandton City shopping and hotel complex 

has been cordoned off to outsiders, with incredibly tight security both surrounding 

it and inside. The organizers have been worried about actions by terrorists since 

this is the first meeting of world leaders since September 11th, and is taking 

place just before the anniversary of the attack on the US.</P>
