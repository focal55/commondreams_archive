least three Palestinians &#150; including two children &#150; were killed yesterday 

when an Israeli tank fired shells into a West Bank market place in what army officials 

said was an attempt to disperse a crowd of people breaking the curfew.</p> 

<p>The killings in Jenin came after Israeli troops invaded the town in response 

to a surge of Palestinian attacks in which 33 Israelis, mainly civilians, have 

been killed in three days.</p>

<p>Atrocities and despair have engulfed the region anew, overshadowing the latest 

frail American initiative even before President George Bush has unveiled it to 

the outside world.</p>

<p>The bloodshed in Jenin came less than a day after a Palestinian from the al-Aqsa 

Martyrs Brigades militia infiltrated a Jewish settlement near Nablus, broke into 

a house and shot dead five people, including a mother and three of her children 

inside their home.</p>

<p>As one horror follows another &#150; claiming the lives of seven Israeli and 

Palestinian children in 15 hours &#150; the focus switched yesterday to Jenin, 

a Palestinian town that has been repeatedly invaded by the Israeli army, which 

regards it as a hotbed of "terror" groups.</p>

<p>Palestinian medical officials said three people were killed &#150; a 50-year-old 

education official, a boy aged six and a seven-year-old girl &#150; when an Israeli 

tank fired shells and a machine-gun into a crowd that had gathered in Jenin's 

market to stock up on food. They said the crowd thought the Israeli military curfew 

on the town had been lifted for two hours.</p>

<p>The Israelis said the Palestinian crowd was not only breaking a curfew, but 

was advancing towards its forces, who were conducting a house-to-house search 

for a explosives. But it also said that a preliminary investigation had shown 

that the tank crew "erred in its action".</p>

<p>Four more Palestinians were killed elsewhere in the occupied territories yesterday.</p>
