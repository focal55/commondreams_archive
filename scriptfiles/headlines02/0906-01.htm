</table></font>Bush, in Louisville for a $1,000-a-plate luncheon for U.S. Rep. Anne Northup, never appeared before the approximately 400 protesters, instead entering the Seelbach Hotel through another entrance.<P>

    About 20 teenagers fronted the protest -- taking place behind police and barricades a few hundred feet from the hotel -- chanting anti-Bush slogans and beating on buckets and drums.<P>



"I'm here to voice opposition to the policies of the Bush administration, specifically 

his isolated policy of going to war with Iraq," said Jana Meyer, holding a sheet 

sign reading 'No U.S. cowboy war in Iraq.' "There's no reason to do it. His reason 

is because it's an election year."

<P>

    Police did take away one protester, David Coyte, who police said was interfering with their barricade. Coyte was charged with failure to disperse.<P>

    While many of the protesters -- some of whom were clad in bandanas and other militant dress -- held signs and chanted against Kentucky Republicans Northup and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority were angered at the possibility of another war in the Middle East.

<P> "There are so many issues that one would be unhappy about with the Bush administration, 

but the most pressing is this crazy threat of a bogus war in Iraq to keep the 

fear going," said protester Stephen Bartlett, 43. "The case is bogus. They haven't 

given other pressures enough of a chance."
