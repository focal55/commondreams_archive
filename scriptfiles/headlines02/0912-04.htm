<p>At St. Paul's Cathedral in London, 3,025 white rose petals floated down from 

the dome of the historic church to commemorate each of the Sept. 11 victims, 67 

of whom were British. 

<P>In Australia, thousands of people gathered in red, white and blue T-shirts 

to form a huge U.S. flag on Surfers' Paradise beach. 

<P>In Rome's Basilica Santa Maria degli Angeli, a memorial Mass included a twisted 

metal cross resting on a pile of rocks to symbolize the devastation of the attacks. 

<P>But compared with the warm embrace of sympathy that so many countries wrapped 

around America one year ago, a shift could be felt in many corners of the globe. 

<P>It is a shift from raw sorrow and sympathy to a more complex sense of caution 

and concern. One year after the day the world changed, people want America to 

know they are worried about the way the only superpower is projecting itself in 

the post-9/11 era, especially its rhetoric of possibly going it alone in a war 

against Iraq. 

<P>Voices as diverse as South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu and German Chancellor 

Gerhard Schroeder have asked Americans to use the anniversary not only to mourn 

and stiffen their resolve in the war on terror, but also to take a long, hard 

look at themselves. 

<P>Schroeder, who has vociferously opposed the U.S. hard-line policy on Iraq and 

ruled out German forces taking part if there is a war, said in a speech Wednesday 

that the two countries had "a deeply rooted friendship that endures despite current 

differences of opinion." 

<P>Protesters outside the U.S. Consulate in Cape Town carried placards, one of 

which read, "9/11: Self-inflicted because of U.S. greed." A Soweto newspaper said 

in an editorial, "An attack on Baghdad could revive anti-U.S. sentiment and inspire 

further attacks on America or its friends -- like Israel. That would be an insult 

to the victims of 9/11." 

<P>Newspaper editorials across Europe reflected the shift. 

<P>The Paris daily Le Monde, which the day after the 9/11 attacks printed the 

headline "We are all Americans," was filled with critical columns Wednesday, one 

of which warned of a "new American imperialism." 

<P>Other editorials cautioned that if the United States were to go it alone in 

Iraq, it would risk unraveling the international coalition against terrorism that 

President Bush so carefully assembled in the aftermath of the attacks. 

<P>The liberal British newspaper, the Guardian, carried an editorial that took 

up the entire front page. It tried to spell out the unease with U.S. foreign policy 

that has developed in Europe as the Bush administration increasingly defined the 

world in simple terms of good and evil: 

<P>"The European press began to squirm uneasily at talk of evil, as if a wine 

and cheese party had suddenly turned into a Pentecostal revival meeting, and looked 

nervously round for the exit sign." 

<P>In Japan, which lost 24 citizens in the attacks, public support of the United 

States was evident at a ceremony outside the U.S. Embassy. Last fall, Japan swiftly 

adopted temporary legislation that circumvented its pacifist constitution and 

allowed the country's Self Defense Force to provide overseas, noncombat aid to 

the U.S. war on terrorism. 

<P>But Japanese public opinion is increasingly vocal against attacking Iraq. In 

a poll published last week by the leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper, 77 percent 

opposed military action against Iraq. 

<P>America's staunchest ally -- with whom it shares bonds of history, language, 

and culture -- is still Great Britain. That closeness was apparent Wednesday in 

a ceremony at the historic Grosvenor Square in central London. 

<P>The square -- where John Adams lived as the first U.S. minister to the Court 

of St. James's and Gen. Dwight Eisenhower had his headquarters as commander of 

the Allied forces -- was the place where people piled bouquets, notes of sympathy, 

and makeshift shrines after 9/11. 

<P>New York Police Lt. Frank Dwyer presented British Home Secretary David Blunkett 

with a British flag found at ground zero. The flag was tattered and blackened 

in patches but intact. 

<P>U.S. Ambassador William Farish told a crowd of several thousand, "We gather 

here today to say thank you, again, to all those who rushed to our aid in America's 

darkest hour, and to all those who stood firmly by our side ever since." 

<P>At London's Heathrow International Airport, the world's largest air traffic 

hub, some British travelers worried that Washington was playing off the emotion 

of Sept. 11 to pursue a hawkish foreign policy. 

<P>Stephanie Morrell, 20, waiting for a friend to arrive from Madrid, said, "It 

is going to be a very emotional day. . . . But emotions can be dangerous." 

<P>Some saw signs that the United States was hearing the warnings. 

<P>"So many, many voices in the U.S. are being raised to say, 'America, let us 

engage in serious introspection. This is an opportunity for a hard look at ourselves.' 

That way lies the way to true greatness," said Tutu, who delivered the main sermon 

at the National Cathedral in Washington.
