CAIRO   - Egypt's president said on Wednesday that  "state terrorism" by Israel to crush what he called legitimate  Palestinian resistance would fuel an appetite for revenge.

<p>But President Hosni Mubarak, addressing the nation in a  televised speech, said his country would continue to tread the  path of moderation and caution in dealing with its neighbor,  without letting heated emotions dictate policies.

<p>"(Israel) has prevented aid agencies and media from  entering towns, villages and refugee camps in order to conceal  the brutal crimes the Israeli army committed," Mubarak said,  accusing Israel of "barbaric aggression."

<p>"(Israel) uses arguments equating legitimate Palestinian  resistance with occupation and terrorism...to avoid its ugly  Israeli practices being depicted as state terrorism," he added.

<p>Israel has threatened to block a United Nations mission to  probe its devastating assault on the Jenin refugee camp during  controversial military operations begun last month.

<p>The operations "will only deepen the feelings of hatred,  resentment, and the desire for revenge among not only the  Palestinian people, but some 300 million Arabs," Mubarak said.

<p>The speech marked the 20th anniversary of the full return  of the Sinai to Egypt after its 1979 peace treaty with Israel.  Sinai Liberation Day, a national holiday, is on Thursday.

<p>Mubarak, Egypt's air force chief during its 1973 war with  Israel, said Egypt would continue a policy of moderation and to  practice restraint.

<p>"Our duty now is remain alert, act with wisdom and reason,  and make sure we plan our steps without emotional  overreaction," he said, adding Egypt needed to protect  political, economic and social gains.

<p>Egypt's relations with Israel have come under increasing  strain since Palestinians began an uprising against Israeli  occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in September 2000.

<p>Egypt scaled back contacts with the Israeli government  earlier this month in response to rising public anger, but left  its vital diplomatic channels open.

<p>Calls by protesters, opposition politicians and television  commentators for more action continue.

<p>Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries to sign full  peace treaties with Israel. Both countries also maintain close  political, economic and military ties with Washington.

<p>Since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, the Arab world has been  dominated by Mubarak's moderate line and hard-liners once led  by Saddam Hussein's Iraq have been sidelined.</p>
