<p>DETROIT -- IT'S not often you see a rabbi being chauffeured by a nun in a car 

emblazoned with the slogan "What Would Jesus Drive?"</p>

<P> But such was the scene last week, when a coalition of Christian and Jewish 

religious leaders came here to press automakers for more fuel-efficient vehicles, 

and were ferried between General Motors and the Ford Motor Company by a convoy 

of nuns driving the Toyota Prius, a small car that combines gas and electric power. 

The slogan, which attracted much attention, was the work of <a href="http://www.creationcare.org/" target="_new">Evangelical 

Environmental Network</a>, a small grassroots group.</p>

<P> These are strange times for the Big Three automakers. Republicans control 

Washington, gas is cheap and light truck sales are stronger than ever, but the 

domestic automakers' cash cow, the sport utility vehicle, is being challenged. 

There is new competition from foreign automakers, and the vehicle has a growing 

list of critics more powerful than some activist Episcopalians. </p>

<P> There is California, which sets its own clean-air regulations and plans to 

force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions and sell some emission-free vehicles. 

Not only is California the largest auto market, other states are allowed to follow 

its guidelines instead of Washington's.</p>

<P> While the government in Washington will be in Republican hands, the California 

legislature stayed firmly Democratic. </p>

<P> "The legislature is largely the same as it was before, perhaps a little bit 

more liberal," said Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile 

Manufacturers, the industry's main lobbying group.</p>

<P> If that weren't enough, foreign competitors like Toyota, Honda and Nissan, 

which have traditionally left big S.U.V.'s and pickups to Detroit, are now flooding 

the market with light trucks. Toyota's share of the light truck market, which 

includes S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans, is growing rapidly; 42 percent of its 

sales in the United States came from light trucks last month — compared with 63 

percent for Ford — and more S.U.V. models are expected. </p>

<P> And while the Big Three have pushed a price war to the brink — it's hard to 

go far beyond zero percent financing — companies like Honda maintain sales with 

far lower incentives and have more flexibility to lower prices. </p>

<P> The new competition is Detroit's "biggest problem in terms of their North 

American automotive operations," said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities. 

The Big Three's automotive profits come entirely from light-truck sales in the 

United States. "It's hard to convince buyers that their S.U.V.'s are as good as 

the Asian brands," Mr. Healy said. </p>

<P> Then there is the changing political sentiment on oil consumption, partly 

because of Sept. 11. It's no surprise that Tom and Ray Magliozzi, the host of 

"Car Talk" on National Public Radio, have begun an anti-S.U.V. campaign, distributing 

"Live Larger, Drive Smaller!" bumper stickers. But car manufacturers also face 

criticism from supposed friends. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who 

will be the new chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, 

is clamoring for action on fuel economy. And Automotive News, a company-town publication, 

wrote an editorial pressing the industry to come up with a plan to lessen oil 

consumption. </p>

<P> Will Detroit listen? </p>

<P> Last week, Ford sent its heaviest hitter, William Clay Ford Jr., the green-minded 

chairman and chief executive, to meet with the religious groups. General Motors, 

which has led lobbying efforts against higher federal fuel economy standards, 

sent lower-level officials. And Chrysler? The company, which makes more light 

trucks as a percentage of their total sales than any other automaker, sent back 

a form letter encouraging the groups to look at their Web site. Officials at Chrysler, 

a unit of DaimlerChrysler, have said there was possibly a miscommunication with 

the company's corporate chiefs in Stuttgart, but the religious leaders are still 

waiting to hear back. </p>

<P> "The faith community has a role to play in getting people to change the way 

they think about things," said the Rev. Robert Edgar, a former Pennsylvania Congressman. 

He is the general secretary of the National Council of Churches of Christ, a coalition 

of 36 different Protestant, Orthodox and Anglican denominations.</p>

<P> But on fuel economy, the automakers showed no hint of backing down on regulatory 

issues. </p>

<P> "Big pickups and big S.U.V.'s could have pretax profits as high as $8,000 

a vehicle," said Mr. Healy, adding "the cash cow has been milked quite a bit over 

the last few years." </p>

<P> Judging from Detroit's newest brand, G.M.'s Hummer, the milking will continue.</p>
