<p> BERKELEY, Calif. — In a city of one cafe after another — three to four to 

a block on some streets — Rick Young chooses his coffee houses carefully. He takes 

his java strong, fresh and Fair Trade.</p>

<P> The way he sees it, the world, or at least Berkeley, would be closer to perfect 

if every cafe, every diner, every restaurant, every <org idsrc="NYSE" value="SE">7-Eleven</org> 

and every bake sale served only Fair Trade certified coffee — coffee that guarantees 

a so-called living wage for small farmers in developing countries. Or the coffee 

would be shade-grown, protecting rain forests and other sensitive environments. 

Or it would be grown without pesticides.</p>

<P> Mr. Young, 36, a rookie lawyer out of the University of California at Berkeley 

law school, has made it a mission to make this happen. </p>

<P> After gathering 3,000 signatures, Mr. Young's voter initiative requiring that 

all cups of coffee sold in Berkeley be Fair Trade, shade-grown or organic has 

qualified for the November ballot. If it passes, it would make this the only city 

in the nation with an official coffee policy.</p>

<P> "If there's an alternative to harming the environment and the coffee tastes 

just as great, why not?" he said the other morning, sitting in a chair outside 

A Cuppa Tea, which serves only Fair Trade brews. </p>

<P> The naysayers are already saying things like, "Only in Berserkeley." But <a href="http://www.transfairusa.org/" target="_new">Transfair 

USA</a>, which is the only Fair Trade certifying organization in the United States 

— and which happens to be based next door to Berkeley, in Oakland — is thrilled. 

</p>

<P> "We are very excited that the ballot initiative is gaining so much momentum," 

said Kenya Lewis, the public relations manager. </p>

<P> "Fair Trade certified coffee is such an easy way for any coffee drinker to 

effect change on critical global issues such as immigration, starvation, drug 

trade and the environment — and more immediately, it really offers a simply way 

to make a real and measurable difference in the lives of farmers." </p>

<P> Even in Berkeley, however, Mr. Young's initiative is not guaranteed success. 

The City Council, which once banned a Boy Scout troop from Japan from City Hall 

because the Boy Scouts in the United States ban gay leaders, has been mumbling 

about the ordinance being too oppressive. </p>

<P> Letters in the local newspapers complain that the initiative is ridiculous. 

Even the mayor, Shirley Dean, who wrote a 1999 regulation requiring that all coffee 

purchased by the city be Fair Trade — the first such law in the country for a 

municipality — is skeptical. </p>

<P> "People feel torn," Ms. Dean said. "They like the idea of drinking an environmentally 

safe and socially responsible coffee. But there are questions over the restraint 

of trade." </p>

<P> Ms. Dean was clearly torn herself. She pushed for the rule on Fair Trade coffee 

in city government after watching a documentary about South American growers, 

who were underpaid and exploited, she said.</p>

<P> "But how can we enforce such a law?" she said, in a city with more than 300 

establishments that would be affected. "How will we tell which coffee is certified? 

You can't do a taste test. What would this law mean for our business inspectors? 

How do you balance the socially responsible against the practical?"</p>

<P> So far, specialty coffee chains, like Peet's (which was born in Berkeley) 

and <org idsrc="NASDAQ" value="SBUX">Starbucks</org> (whose founders learned the 

ropes at Peet's) have demurred from commenting on the initiative. Both offer Fair 

Trade coffee beans to customers as options.</p>

<P> Other cafe owners in Berkeley are annoyed, if not downright incensed, at Mr. 

Young's idea.</p>

<P> "The proposal seems fascist," said Darryl Ross, owner of several cafes, including 

one, across from the law school at Berkeley, which serves only Fair Trade coffee. 

</p>

<P> "No business wants to be forced to carry a specific brand," said Mr. Ross, 

who remembered when Mr. Young as a student, threatened a boycott of his cafe if 

he did not go the Fair Trade-only route. That worked, but Mr. Ross said few people 

seem to think the initiative is a good idea.</p>

<P> "I don't even see much support for it among the professional Fair Trade lovers," 

he said, "or the card-carrying radicals and Berkeley liberals."</p>

<P> Samir Nassar, owner of Brewed Awakening, a family-run cafe that offers organic 

and Fair Trade coffee as an option, said restricting the business would cost customers 

more because the coffee itself is more expensive. </p>

<P> "I would say 99.9 percent of my customers are making fun of the petitioner," 

he said. "They think he has too much time on his hands." </p>

<P> Mr. Young, a native of Scranton, Pa., who has lived and traveled all over 

the world, teaching English and skiing and leading cycling tours, does happen 

to be underemployed at the moment. He was recently laid off from a small law firm. 

</p>

<P> He said he is devoting quite a bit of time to his initiative and is surprised 

at the attention and vitriol it is generating. He said he had received hate e-mail 

on his Web site (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/coffeelawinfo/" target="_new">www.geocities.com/coffeelawinfo/</a>). 

</p>

<P> Still, more than a few people in Berkeley, and elsewhere, are also championing 

his cause. I've gotten a lot of "way to go's"' he said. </p>

<P> As if scripted, he was approached by a passerby. "You're the coffee man," 

the middle-age, bearded man said. "I saw you on CNN. I want to applaud what you're 

doing."</p>

<P> "That's never happened before," Mr. Young said, looking very much like a winning 

campaign was brewing.</p>
