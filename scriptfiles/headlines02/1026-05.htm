<p>WASHINGTON - Protesters hope as many as 100,000 people will converge on the 

U.S. capital on Saturday to demonstrate against a possible U.S. attack on Iraq.

</table></font>Demonstrators from as far as Chicago and Minnesota will

come to Washington, many by bus, to gather by the Vietnam war

memorial on the Mall and then march to the White House.

Speakers will include civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.<P> &quot;This is going to be an ugly, unnecessary fight. Most of

the world is saying no to it,&quot; Jackson told reporters.

&quot;Preemptive one-bullet diplomacy, we cannot resort to that.&quot;<P> A tandem 

demonstration -- expected to be equal in size to the gathering in the nation's 

capital -- will take place in San Francisco on Saturday.

<P> &quot;There is incredible momentum against (President George W.

) Bush, that will culminate in a massive outpouring that we

hope will be big enough to challenge and stop war plans against

Iraq,&quot; said Tony Murphy, one of the protest's organizers.<P> &quot;This has the potential to be as strong a movement as that

against the Vietnam war in the 1960s,&quot; he said, adding that the

march could draw as many as 100,000 students, veterans and

union members from across the country.<P> In the late 1960s, with the country mired in a costly

campaign to fight communism in Vietnam, hundreds of thousands

of demonstrators gathered in major cities to demonstrate

against the war.<P> Hours before the march in Washington was due to start,

several thousand protesters were assembling on the National

Mall. Some carried signs reading: &quot;No Proof, No War,&quot; &quot;Bush

Sucks&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice Oil for Justice.&quot;<P> SOCIAL PROGRAMS FAVORED OVER WAR<P> Protesters will call upon the U.S. government to abandon

war plans against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and to spend the

tens of billions of dollars the campaign could cost on social

programs in the United States.<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

</table></font>They will also ask that sanctions imposed on the Middle

Eastern nation after the Gulf War in 1991 be lifted, as these

were blamed by protesters and groups such as UNICEF for the

deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians.<P> &quot;If violence fixed the problem, then Israel should be at

peace,&quot; said Rick Blumhorst of Kansas, a Gulf War veteran

wearing his Army dress uniform. &quot;Acting unilaterally, we're

going to inflame the Muslim community.&quot;<P> The U.S. Congress has approved a resolution that would give

Bush the power to declare war on Iraq, a campaign that the

president said would rid the country of suspected weapons of

mass destruction and possibly oust Saddam.<P> Tamir Musa, an Iraqi who has lived in Michigan for 10

years, traveled to Washington with about 500 other exiles to

show their support for efforts to remove Saddam from power.<P> &quot;The war is good if it goes to kill Saddam Hussein. He has

a lot of bombs; he's terrorist number one,&quot; Musa said.<P> A Reuters poll of 22 defense experts from around the world

found they believed it was likely the United States would

invade Iraq in the next six months.<P> In San Francisco, protest organizers expect thousands of

people from across the western states to attend a march and

rally near city hall. Speakers will include California

Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, who opposed a congressional

resolution on using force against Iraq, and Vietnam veteran Ron

Kovic, whose story was told in the movie &quot;Born on the Fourth of

July.&quot;<P> Antiwar protests are also planned for Saturday in cities

worldwide, including Mexico City, Copenhagen, Seoul, Tokyo,

Berlin and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Last month more than 150,000

people rallied in London against a campaign on Iraq.</p>
