<p>In one more piece of evidence that the Earth's climate is warming rapidly, 

a new study published Friday in <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_new">Science</a></i> 

magazine has found that Alaska's glaciers are melting more quickly than previously 

believed.

<p> The resulting meltwater is also contributing much more to the rise in sea 

level than previous estimates, according to the study by a team of University 

of Alaska researchers in Fairbanks, which also found that both trends are accelerating. 

<p> "The rate of thinning has doubled in the past five years, compared to the 

40 years before," said Anthony Arendt, the study's main author.

</table></font>As a result, the Alaskan contribution to sea-level rise has also doubled, 

to about 0.27 mms a year during the past decade, or about twice the amount assumed 

by an international panel of scientists that last year predicted sea level would 

rise up to 11 centimeters (about four inches) by the end of this century due to 

global warming. 

<p> "It's a big deal if those rates have been underestimated," said Tom Janetos, 

an expert at the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment. "If 

these results are correct, the rate of sea-level rise has probably been underestimated 

in all international assessments." 

<p> More than 100 million people live on land within one meter of sea level, and 

storm surges can devastate coral reefs and low-lying islands and coastlines around 

the world. 

<p> "Although some degree of sea-level rise is anticipated in the coming decades, 

the greater the rise and the faster it occurs, the greater the impact will be 

on human population," according to Benjamin Preston, a researcher at the Washington 

D.C.-based Pew Center on Global Climate Change. 

<p> Despite their relatively small land mass--about 13 percent of the world's 

total mountain glacier area--Alaska's glaciers contribute about half of all sea 

rise caused by glacial melt and about twice as much as the amount of water lost 

from the entire Greenland Ice Sheet, according to the study. 

<p> A second study published in <i>Science</i> Friday will also add to concerns 

about the impact on oceans of faster ice melt. Using records compiled over the 

last 40 years, researchers at Columbia University found a sharp decline in the 

salinity of waters in the Ross Sea near Antarctica, as well as warmer air and 

water temperatures in the area. 

<p> The warmer atmosphere appears to have caused more rain and snowfall, less 

sea ice, and faster melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet, according to the 

study. Previously, low salinity found in masses of seawater flowing from the Antarctic 

to the South Pacific was attributed to more precipitation, but the new study confirms 

that increased melting of the ice cap itself is also a major factor. 

<p> Declining salinity could affect major ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream 

which warms the waters and climate of the North Atlantic region, according to 

oceanographers. One increasingly prominent theory suggests that a significant 

flow of fresh water into the North Atlantic could actually reverse the Gulf Stream, 

as it has in the past, causing an abrupt plunge in water and air temperatures 

in northeastern North America and northwestern Europe. 

<p> "If scientists have underestimated the amount of fresh water likely to enter 

the oceans in coming decades, they may have also underestimated the risk of such 

a phenomenon occurring," said Preston.
