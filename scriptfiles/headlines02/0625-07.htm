<p> CALGARY, Alberta - Anti-globalization activists stripped in front of hundreds 

of bemused office workers outside a downtown Calgary Gap Inc. store on Tuesday 

to protest the clothing retailer's labor policies.</p>

</table></font>Chanting "I'd rather wear nothing than wear The Gap," two

dozen out of about 100 protesters peeled off their clothes to

the hoots and hollers of the lunch-hour crowd, accusing Gap of

buying clothing from third-world sweatshops and the family that

controls it of destroying a redwood forest in California.</p><p> It was one of several nonviolent demonstrations in this

Canadian oil-industry city ahead of the summit of Group of

Eight leaders in the Rocky Mountain resort of Kananaskis, some

90 km (55 miles) away.</p><p> One line of activists dropped their pants to reveal the

words "boycott Gap," with one letter on each cheek of their

posteriors.</p><p> "We say that corporate exploitation is indecent -- that's

the true pornography -- and worse," said Mary Bull, one of the

organizers of the protest that attracted a crush of onlookers

and media to Calgary's Stephen Avenue walking mall, a popular

lunchtime spot in the summer.</p><p> "What were doing is a political action showing how strongly

we feel about the issues of sweatshop labor and deforestation."</p><p> Gap disputed the claims, saying it has made a policy of

dispatching staff and independent inspectors to factories

worldwide to make sure owners were living up to safety,

environmental and labor standards.</p><p> "Last year alone, Gap Inc. inspectors conducted over 16,000

inspections," spokesman Jamie Edgerton said.</p><p> Edgerton also said Mendocino Redwood Co., in which Gap's

chairman has a stake, had received certification for its

logging policies that had the backing of such groups as

Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund.</p><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

</table></font></font>A coalition of labor, environmental and anti-globalization

activists have been kept well away from secluded Kananaskis by

Canada's biggest ever security detail, which includes military

checkpoints and advanced weaponry.</p><p> Calgary is the base of thousands of media representatives

covering the meeting, as well as activists angry that U.S.

President George W. Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and

the other G8 leaders will make decisions on major economic and

development issues without input from ordinary people.</p><p> Residents of the city of 900,000 people have been on edge,

fearing violence that marked at other major world meetings,

like last year's G8 summit in Genoa, Italy, could erupt here.</p><p> But protests have so far been party-like, even with a huge

police presence.</p><p> Oil industry worker Robert Judd conceded he and his colleague 

Natalie Evans were drawn to the risque demonstration by the promise of seeing 

people in the nude.</p>

<p> "I've never really seen a protest before either, so it's

something new," Judd said, adding he would likely not boycott

the San Francisco-based clothing chain.</p><p> Evans sheepishly admitted amid the banging of drums and

chanting that the yellow top she was wearing was bought at The

Gap.</p><p> Calgary is not the only Canadian city where protests are

planned. Activists have also converged on the capital of

Ottawa, more than half a continent away.</p><p> An umbrella group of some 30 protest organizations

including self-described anarchists promised on Tuesday to

disrupt that city with marches and other protests this week.</p><p> The G8, comprising Canada, Italy, Japan, France, Germany,

Britain, Russia and the United States, meet officially on

Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
