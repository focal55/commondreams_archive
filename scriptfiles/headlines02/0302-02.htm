FARC Camp, Caqueta province, Colombia</b> --

The first rays of dawn cut through the jungle canopy as a Marxist 

rebel stripped down his Kalashnikov assault rifle and one of his comrades 

plopped ammunition into the drum of a multiple grenade launcher.

<P>After three years of relative calm in the southern corner of this conflict-

torn nation, guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, are back on a combat footing -- and they say they are ready to take on the 

United States as well as the Colombian government.

<P>"I smell a war brewing here, and the gringo army with its Ranger force is 

stoking the fire," senior FARC commander Fabian Ramirez told The Chronicle in 

a visit to his camp this week. "But I can tell them that this will be worse 

than Vietnam for them."

</table></font>Fighting flared up last week after peace negotiations with the Colombian 

government collapsed and the country's president, Andres Pastrana, sent waves 

of Vietnam-era OV-10 fighter bombers and aging Israeli Kafir fighters to bomb 

and strafe this jungle region, which until Feb. 20 was part of a government-

sanctioned guerrilla haven.

<P>FARC commanders believe the United States may assume a greater role in a 

war that has claimed more than 35,000 lives in the past decade alone.

<P>Past U.S. administrations have provided military assistance to Colombia as 

part of America's war on drugs -- a $1.3 billion package called Plan Colombia 

aimed at wiping out drug-producing crops.

<P>Recently, President Bush proposed an extra $439 million to provide military 

intelligence and spare parts to the Colombian armed forces. The United States 

already has 250 U.S. military personnel, 50 Pentagon civilian employees and 

100 civilian contractors in Colombia.

<P>In addition, Washington wants an extra $98 million to train, arm and 

provide air support for Colombian troops to protect a 480-mile oil pipeline 

jointly owned by the Occidental Petroleum Corp., with headquarters in Los 

Angeles, and the Colombian state oil company.

<P>So far, there is little sign of active U.S. involvement in the renewed war. 

The Colombian military, which has airlifted some 11,000 troops into the region, now controls the five main towns in the former safe zone and boasts that the 

rebels are on the run.

<P>But Ramirez says the FARC, which is skilled in rural hit-and-run warfare, 

has simply split up into small units -- at most, 60-strong companies -- and 

dispersed into the jungle and savannah of the Switzerland-size former 

demilitarized zone.

<P><b>REBELS BIDE THEIR TIME</b>

<P>"We're not running away. We just don't want to fight in the towns," said 

Ramirez, who is the No. 2 commander of the FARC's battle-hardened Southern 

Bloc fighting division. "We'll wait for the army's Rapid Deployment Force and 

special units to come into the countryside, and then they will meet up with us.

"

<P>The rebels insisted on taking this reporter to the camp under cover of 

darkness and in silence. They repeatedly paused as they strained to hear the 

drone of a government AC-47 aircraft -- a sophisticated and heavily armored 

reconnaissance plane -- in the distance.

<P>From here, it does appear that the countryside remains far beyond the 

government's grasp. Ramirez, one of the architects of some of the heaviest 

defeats inflicted on the army in 38 years of conflict, said many of his forces 

had split into units as small as 12 fighters, presenting a highly mobile and 

extremely difficult target to detect or hit.

<P>Outlining rebel tactics, Ramirez explained that before rebel patrols begin 

attacking the army, they will wait to see how many soldiers are finally 

deployed in the area and what firepower -- especially attack helicopters and 

fighter-bombers -- the military will muster.

<P>Once the army gains sufficient confidence to venture into the countryside, 

Ramirez said, intense fighting will commence.

<P>In recent days, FARC guerrillas have killed a handful of civilians they 

suspected of spying for the army or for right-wing paramilitaries, the rebels' 

arch-nemesis. The slayings appear to be a brutal attempt at hindering enemy 

intelligence gathering rather than indiscriminate attacks on the civilian 

population.

<P>Ramirez and his fighters are also stepping up a campaign of infrastructure 

sabotage. Much of southern Caqueta province has been incommunicado and running 

on candle power for the last week due to the rebels' dynamiting of electricity 

pylons and telecommunications towers -- a job that can be achieved by just a 

handful of fighters.

<P>"The energy and communications industries are in the hands of the big 

economic conglomerates and the multinationals," Ramirez said, grasping his U.S.

-made AR-15 assault rifle. "Now it is time for them to suffer the rigors of 

war."

<P><b>ROAD CONNECTIONS CUT</b>

<P>The FARC has also bombed a number of bridges, isolating Caqueta from the 

center of the country and the capital, Bogota, via overland routes.

<P>The main highway between Florencia, the capital of Caqueta, and San Vicente 

del Caguan, the main town in the former guerrilla haven, is strewn with the 

wrecks of cars and trucks that guerrillas have burned after setting up 

fleeting roadblocks. Traffic has slowed to a trickle and for almost a week was 

paralyzed completely.

<P>In towns along the route, supplies are running low, sending citizens into a 

panic.

<P>"President (Andres) Pastrana said he was going to protect us, and yet the 

army has no way to control even the highway," said one civilian as he waited 

to fill a plastic tank with gasoline -- rationed by the pump owner to $10 

worth per family.

<P>When Pastrana announced the end of the peace process on Feb. 20 -- after 

the FARC hijacked a commercial airline flight and kidnapped a senator who is a 

member of Colombia's peace commission -- he warned of a possible upsurge in 

"terrorist" attacks. Clashes have been reported in rural areas around Bogota, 

but the rebels have not yet launched a full-blown bombing campaign in 

Colombia's main cities.

<P>Many analysts, though, predict the FARC may unleash an urban campaign in an 

attempt to divert government forces away from the southeast.

<P>In an interview with The Chronicle, Carlos Antonio Lozada, the former head 

of FARC operations in Bogota, said urban guerrillas had received improved 

training, especially in bomb-making techniques and weapons handling -- a 

departure from their traditional tasks of fund raising and information 

gathering.

<P>With the peace process ended, one of the biggest questions now is how much 

the FARC may have grown in the last three years. Military officials have 

frequently charged that the rebels used the cover of their haven to step up 

recruiting and training.

<P><b>DRUG TRAFFICKING ALLEGED</b>

<P>This week, Klaus Nyholm, head of the U.N. Drug Control Program in Colombia, 

accused the rebels of deepening their ties to the cocaine trade, which if true 

could have brought in millions of extra dollars to finance their war machine.

<P>One senior guerrilla source speculated the FARC may have doubled its 

numbers over the last three years, which could put the total combat force at 

anywhere from 25,000 fighters to more than 30,000. No government or 

international sources have confirmed such an expansion.

<P>According to a rebel strategic plan mapped out in the early 1980s and 

forecast to take perhaps 30 years, the FARC set a goal of expanding to at 

least 32,000 fighters and building up huge stockpiles of weapons, and then 

launching what it termed the "first great offensive" -- an all-out assault on 

Bogota aimed at seizing power by force.

<P>But there is no suggestion at present that "the first great offensive" is 

imminent. The rebel source said the FARC lacks sufficient weaponry and 

ammunition.

<P>"As long as unemployment and poverty are rising, and hospitals and schools 

are closing, then we will recruit more fighters," Ramirez said. "People find 

they have no other form of protest except to join insurgent ranks."

<P>

At first glance, the fight between the government and the Revolutionary 

Armed Forces of Colombia rebels hardly looks like a fair fight: Colombia's 

armed forces far outnumber their guerrilla counterparts, and President Bush 

wants to augment the Colombian government's campaign with $439 million in U.S. 

military support. But this conflict will be fought on the rebels' home turf in 

the Colombian jungle, and they are skilled in the sort of hit-and-run warfare 

that figures to be a part of the conflict.
