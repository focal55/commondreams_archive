<p>On Christmas Eve, the Bishop of Bath and Wells will tell his congregation at Wells Cathedral that "the sanctity of life precludes all war and violence. We must be guided by a vision of the world in which nations stop seeking to resolve their problems through violence."</p>

<p>He is one of numerous bishops who will use their Christmas message to speak out against the increasing push by Britain and the US towards war with Iraq.</p>

<p>All 44 Church of England diocesan bishops and the Archbishops of Canterbury and York were asked by The Independent on Sunday about the threat of war with Iraq.</p>

<p>At least seven of the 30 who replied said that they intended to make direct references to Iraq in their Christmas sermons.</p>

<p>The fact so many responded at all is remarkable in itself. Where thorny political issues are involved, Church of England bishops are not known for their candid views.</p>

<p>However, this is not the first time they have questioned the morality of war with Iraq. The benchmark for anti-war sentiment was set in October this year when the House of Bishops published a report questioning the morality and legality of war against Iraq.</p>

<p>In a submission to a leading Government committee, the bishops said force should only be considered as a last resort and military action could not be justified.</p>

<p>This was accompanied by a 3,000-signature petition signed by senior Anglican and Roman Catholic leaders, including the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, who in his Dimbleby lecture last week challenged the Government's authority.</p>

<p><b>Rt Rev Peter Price</b></p>

<p><i>Bath and Wells</i></p>

<p>We should take the message of the angels not as a passing hope,or as a moment of piety, but as a directive of God ..."</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, the bishop will tell worshippers that "the sanctity of life precludes all war and violence. We must be guided by a vision of the world in which nations stop seeking to resolve their problems through violence."</p>

<p><b>Rt Rev John Gladwin </b></p>

<p><i>Guildford</i></p>

<p>The stench of war hangs over Iraq. Out of our own windows we can see the broken and excluded on our streets, hear the sounds of discord within even the most prosperous of domestic situations. We are reminded that the message of Christmas is the coming of Christ. In this vulnerable child, we see the uncertainties and inhumanities which beset this modern world and we also see its salvation.</p>

<p><b>Rt Rev Richard Lewis</b></p>

<p><i>Ipswich</i></p>

<p>Across the globe this year, we have become increasingly aware of a growing feeling of the need for revenge against those we feel are oppressing us. The question for all of us is whether we give in to that knee-jerk need for revenge ... or whether we address the essential questions of justice and peace that underlie that need.</p>

<p><b>Rt Rev John Packer</b></p>

<p><i>Ripon and Leeds</i></p>

<p>It does not feel easy to write of peace this Christmas. Iraq hangs over us all as we pray for her government, and for the United Nations in the search for peace with justice for all, and especially for minority groups in Iraq.</p>

<p><b>Rt Rev Anthony Russell</b></p>

<p><i>Ely</i></p>

<p>Many people in this country have severe doubts about the appropriateness of military action. The consequences would be terrible and could provoke Iraq into using some of the ghastly weapons it is believed to hold. It's not a just war. The principal conflict in the Muslim world is Israel-Palestine, and America and the UN must be prepared to work towards a resolution of this conflict.</p>

<p><b>Rt Rev Michael Turnbull</b></p>

<p><i>Durham</i></p>

<p>America is a very bruised nation, understandably in the aftermath of 11 September. The danger of being bruised and humiliated like that is that you want to strike back. Decision-makers in the US need to be aware of that danger and ask themselves whether the situation in Iraq and the terrorist threat are really related. </p>
