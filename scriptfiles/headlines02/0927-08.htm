<p>  The International Atomic Energy Agency says that a report cited by President 

Bush as evidence that Iraq in 1998 was &#34;six months away&#34; from developing 

a nuclear weapon does not exist. 

<p>&#34;There&#39;s never been a report like that issued from this agency,&#34; 

Mark Gwozdecky, the IAEA&#39;s chief spokesman, said yesterday in a telephone 

interview from the agency&#39;s headquarters in Vienna, Austria.

<p>&#34;We&#39;ve never put a time frame on how long it might take Iraq to construct 

a nuclear weapon in 1998,&#34; said the spokesman of the agency charged with assessing 

Iraq&#39;s nuclear capability for the United Nations.

<p>In a Sept. 7 news conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Mr. Bush 

said: &#34;I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and 

were denied — finally denied access [in 1998], a report came out of the Atomic 

— the IAEA that they were six months away from developing a weapon.

<p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what more evidence we need,&#34; said the president, 

defending his administration&#39;s case that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was building 

weapons of mass destruction. 

<p>The White House says Mr. Bush was referring to an earlier IAEA report.

<p>&#34;He&#39;s referring to 1991 there,&#34; said Deputy Press Secretary Scott 

McClellan. &#34;In &#39;91, there was a report saying that after the war they 

found out they were about six months away.&#34;

<p>Mr. Gwozdecky said no such report was ever issued by the IAEA in 1991.

<p>Many news agencies — including The Washington Times — reported Mr. Bush&#39;s 

Sept. 7 comments as referring to a 1998 IAEA report. The White House did not ask 

for a correction from The Times.

<p>To clear up the confusion, Mr. McClellan cited two news articles from 1991 

— a July 16 story in the London Times by Michael Evans and a July 18 story in 

the New York Times by Paul Lewis. But neither article cites an IAEA report on 

Iraq&#39;s nuclear-weapons program or states that Saddam was only six months away 

from &#34;developing a weapon&#34; — as claimed by Mr. Bush.

<p>The article by Mr. Evans says: &#34;Jay Davis, an American expert working for 

the U.N. special commission charged with removing Iraq&#39;s nuclear capability, 

said Iraq was only six months away from the large-scale production of enriched 

uranium at two plants inspected by UN officials.&#34;

<p>The Lewis article said Iraq in 1991 had a uranium &#34;enrichment plant using 

electromagnetic technology [that] was about six months from becoming operational.&#34;

<p>In October 1998, just before Saddam kicked U.N. weapons inspectors out of Iraq, 

the IAEA laid out a case opposite of Mr. Bush&#39;s Sept. 7 declaration.

<p>&#34;There are no indications that there remains in Iraq any physical capability 

for the production of weapon-usable nuclear material of any practical significance,&#34; 

IAEA Director-General Mohammed Elbaradei wrote in a report to U.N. Secretary-General 

Kofi Annan.

<p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair on Sept. 7 cited an agency &#34;report&#34; declaring 

that satellite photography revealed the Iraqis had undertaken new construction 

at several nuclear-related sites. This week, the IAEA said no such report existed.

<p>The IAEA also took issue with a Sept. 9 report by the International Institute 

for Strategic Studies — cited by the Bush administration — that concludes Saddam 

&#34;could build a nuclear bomb within months if he were able to obtain fissile 

material.&#34;

<p>&#34;There is no evidence in our view that can be substantiated on Iraq&#39;s 

nuclear-weapons program. If anybody tells you they know the nuclear situation 

in Iraq right now, in the absence of four years of inspections, I would say that 

they&#39;re misleading you because there isn&#39;t solid evidence out there,&#34; 

Mr. Gwozdecky said.

<p>&#34;I don&#39;t know where they have determined that Iraq has retained this 

much weaponization capability because when we left in December &#39;98 we had 

concluded that we had neutralized their nuclear-weapons program. We had confiscated 

their fissile material. We had destroyed all their key buildings and equipment,&#34; 

he said. 

<p>Mr. Gwozdecky said there is no evidence about Saddam&#39;s nuclear capability 

right now — either through his organization, other agencies or any government.</p>
