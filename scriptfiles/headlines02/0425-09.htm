NEW YORK   - 

A U.S. judge on Thursday said he is

prepared to rule the federal death penalty unconstitutional but

will give the government a "last opportunity" to convince him

otherwise.

<p>



An unconstitutionality ruling would apply only in the

Southern District of New York, which covers Manhattan and the

Bronx. It would not apply to the death penalty in individual

states.

<p>

Judge Jed Rakoff of the Manhattan federal court gave U.S.

Justice Department lawyers until May 15 to argue whether

retaining capital punishment as a means of deterrence and

retribution "can constitutionally justify the knowing execution

of innocent persons."

<p>

The judge issued his opinion at a time when death penalty

opponents are growing more vocal, and even some supporters are

calling for greater procedural safeguards.

<p>

The issue arose in a narcotics and murder case in which two

of eight defendants, Alan Quinones and Diego Rodriguez, pleaded

not guilty. The government sought the death penalty for both

defendants in the trial, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 2,

the opinion said.

<p>

"It's obviously a very bold step on the judge's part," said

Robert Pugsley, a professor at the Southwestern University

School of Law in Los Angeles and a death penalty supporter.

"Certainly his order will be appealed to the Second Circuit

Court of Appeals, which in my view is likely to strike down his

order as premature because the case has not yet begun."

<p>

DUE PROCESS

<p>

Lawyers for the defendants sought to dismiss the death

penalty aspects of the case, arguing that innocent people could

be put to death before techniques, such as DNA testing, or

other evidence may later emerge and establish innocence.

<p>

"We now know, in a way almost unthinkable even a decade

ago, that our system of criminal justice, for all its

protections, is sufficiently fallible that innocent people are

convicted of capital crimes with some frequency," wrote Rakoff,

appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton.

<p>

The judge called "no longer ... tenable" the U.S. Supreme

Court's implicit assumption in a 1993 case, Herrera v. Collins,

that evidentiary and procedural safeguards and the appeals

process would render "highly unlikely" that an executed person

would later be found innocent.

<p>

The "state-sponsored death of a meaningful number of

innocent people" could deprive those people of due process, the

judge said. Accordingly, "if the court were compelled to decide

the issue today, it would ... dismiss all death penalty aspects

of this case on the ground that the federal death penalty

statute is unconstitutional," he said.

<p>

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York,

Marvin Smilon, said, "We're reviewing the opinion." He declined

further comment.

<p>

"HAD ITS CHANCE"

<p>

Kevin McNally, a death penalty defense specialist at

Frankfort, Kentucky-based McNally & O'Donnell who represents

Quinones, hailed the judge's opinion.

<p>

"The modern death penalty has had its chance over the last

25 years and has produced repeated death sentences for innocent

citizens," he said. "It's about time that a judge tackled this

distressing development. I wouldn't be surprised if the

government appealed."

<p>

Pugsley said he shares Rakoff's concerns about executing

innocent people, and that "the national concerns expressed in

his order are shared by many Americans, even those who support

the death penalty.

<p>

Still, he said, "I don't believe this particular court's

initiative will stand up."

<p>

The Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.

There have been 770 U.S. death sentences carried out since

then, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, and

McNally said 100 innocent people have been freed from death row

over that time.

<p>

Earlier this month an Illinois task force set up by

Republican Gov. George Ryan urged imposing procedural and other

safeguards to ensure that death sentences be imposed more

fairly. The governor in 2000 suspended executions after several

death-row inmates were found to be innocent.

<p>

Thirty-eight states have death penalty laws on their books,

but the American Bar Association has called for a national

moratorium on executions.
