<p>SYDNEY - Greenpeace protesters leapt into the sea in front of two ships carrying 

nuclear waste off the Australian mainland Monday after an overnight game of maritime 

cat and mouse.

<p>The controversial transportation of the weapons-grade  material is the first of its kind since the Sept. 11 attacks on  the United States, and has sparked international outrage from  governments and environmental groups who say the cargo is a  tempting target for militants on the high seas.

chases the Pacific Teal, one of two freighters bringing plutonium through the 

Tasman Sea, between Australia and new Zealand, Monday, July 22, 2002. The vessels 

are carrying 255 kilograms (650 pounds) of mixed plutonium and uranium reactor 

fuel from Japan to Britain after the radioactive material has been rejected as 

faulty by a Japanese power company. The small boat is one of a Greenpeace-organized 

flotilla of 11 boats. (AP Photo/Greenpeace, Sandy Scheltema, HO)<br>

</table></font>The lightly armed ships are returning the waste that state-owned British Nuclear 

Fuels Plc (BNFL) shipped to Japan three years ago but agreed to take back after 

it emerged BNFL had falsified documentation associated with the cargo.</span> 

<span class="newsContent">BNFL described the protesters' actions as "lunacy" and said  Greenpeace had "endangered lives."<p>Greenpeace's "Nuclear Free Flotilla" caught up with the  British-registered freighters, Pacific Pintail and Pacific  Teal, with about 495 pounds of plutonium on board, in  international waters in the Tasman Sea around dawn Monday.<p>New South Wales Senator Ian Cohen and another protester  threw themselves into the water just 450 yards in front of the  oncoming ships, brandishing a "Nuclear Free Pacific" banner.<p>Cohen, who jumped into the water with his trademark  surfboard, said the protest had been "fantastic" and a triumph  for "Aussie surfboard diplomacy."<p>"The Zodiacs (high-speed rubber boats) were out there  chasing the boats for about seven hours and catching them and  getting a protest out there in the middle of nowhere was  brilliant," he told Reuters by ship-to-shore telephone.<p>The nuclear ships are currently about 625 miles east of the  Australian mainland and heading south around Tasmania and west  around Australia and out across the Indian Ocean.

<p><b>"LUNACY"</b>

<p>BNFL hit back at Greenpeace, saying the protesters who had  jumped into the sea had endangered not only their own lives but  the lives of others.<p>"To throw themselves into the water in front of the vessel  is the height of maritime lunacy and does Greenpeace no credit  whatsoever," BNFL spokesman Mark Scott said in a statement.<p>"They should be condemned for their stupidity."<p>The Australian Democrats, Greens and Greenpeace have all  said the shipment put the Australian mainland at risk but a  spokesman for Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said  the government was satisfied about security.<p>"The appropriate safeguards are in place and the shipment  entirely complies with international law. Australia has no  position to object," he said.

<p>But New Zealand is unhappy and has ordered its air force to track the ships.

<p>"The government has made clear its opposition to such  shipments and, as expected, as with previous shipments, the  vessels seem to be staying well clear of New Zealand's 200-mile  exclusive economic zone," said New Zealand Defense Minister  Mark Burton in a statement.<p>The shipment is destined for the British reprocessing plant  at Sellafield on England's northwest coast. The government in  Ireland, whose coastline is just 110 miles across the Irish  Sea, has long campaigned for the plant's closure.<p>The controversial shipment comes at a time when British  Energy Minister Brian Wilson has published a policy paper  outlining plans to reform the creaking nuclear power industry.

<p>A new state agency would be responsible for paying to clean up existing waste 

sites and mothball old plants, taking on huge liabilities from BNFL in what industry 

experts see as a move toward privatizing the remaining profitable bits of the 

company.</span>
