<p>Tony Blair launched an onslaught against Saddam Hussein's human rights record 

yesterday in an attempt to sway public opinion in favor of military action against 

Iraq.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office released a graphic 23-page dossier giving details of the 

Iraqi regime. But the publication sparked accusations of political opportunism 

from human rights groups, while left-wing Labour MPs claimed the Government was 

"softening up" the public for war.</p>

<p>The dossier, published six days before the deadline for President Saddam to 

release details of his weapons of mass destruction, reports on torture techniques 

including eye gouging, mock executions and lowering victims into acid baths. It 

describes systematic raping of women and persecution of the Kurds and other minorities.</p>

<p>A four-minute video released by the Foreign Office included images of blood-spattered 

prison cells, the burns of torture victims, and dead children after gas attacks 

on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988.</p>

<p>The report said: "Iraq is a terrifying place to live ... these grave violations 

of human rights are not the work of a number of over-zealous individuals but the 

deliberate policy of the regime. Fear is Saddam's chosen method for staying in 

power."</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said the report would "remind the world 

that the abuses of the Iraqi regime extend far beyond its pursuit of weapons of 

mass destruction".</p>

<p>Amnesty International accused the Government of failing to speak out about 

human rights abuses in a string of states allied to the West. A spokesman said: 

"We are concerned about the timing and whether that introduces a measure of political 

opportunism."</p>

<p>Hania Mufti, of the international pressure group <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human 

Rights Watch</a>, said: "The timing would not be so much of an issue if it came 

against a background of previous actions by the Government to expose human rights 

violations."</p>

<p>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs spokesman, warned: "This 

dossier, no matter how horrific its terms, would not provide cover for action 

against Iraq unless it were accompanied by a mandate from the UN."</p>

<p>Alice Mahon, the Labour MP, said: "Why is this being published now? We know 

all of this is part of a softening-up exercise." Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for 

Linlithgow, said: "I think that this highly unusual, indeed, unprecedented publication 

is cranking up for war."</p> </p>
