UNITED NATIONS  - 

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

Annan harshly criticized Israel on Tuesday, calling on it to

rein in its attacks on Palestinian civilians and end its

"illegal occupation" of Palestinian lands.

</table></font>In an emotional plea delivered at a public meeting of the

U.N. Security Council, Annan said the Middle East death toll

had soared to appalling levels and urged leaders on both sides

to "lead your peoples away from disaster."

<p>

In his toughest message to date to Israel, he said, "You

must end the illegal occupation" of lands captured in the 1967

Middle East war. Aides said it was the first time Annan had

branded the occupations as illegal.

<p>

And he appealed to Israeli defense forces to stop "the

bombing of civilian areas, the assassinations, the unnecessary

use of lethal force, the demolitions and the daily humiliation

of ordinary Palestinians."

<p>

"Such actions gravely erode Israel's standing in the

international community and further fuel the fires of hatred,

despair and extremism among Palestinians," Annan said.

<p>

He also slammed the Palestinians, saying they "have played

their full part in the escalating cycle of violence,

counter-violence and revenge," and calling on them to stop all

acts of terror.

<p>

He was "particularly disturbed" by the rise in Palestinian

suicide bombings deliberately targeting civilians, he said,

calling such attacks "morally repugnant."

<p>

PALESTINIAN PRAISE

<p>

But the Palestinian U.N. representative, Nasser al-Kidwa,

quickly praised Annan's statement as "the strongest, the

clearest position the secretary-general has come up with" on

the Middle East since the beginning of a Palestinian uprising

in September 1999 that the United Nations says has claimed some

1,550 lives.

<p>

The Palestinians will ask the Security Council to adopt a

resolution putting more pressure on Israel, although he

understood some of the council's 15 member-nations preferred to

adopt a weaker nonbinding statement on the Middle East

situation, he said.

<p>

"We prefer a more formal action by the Security Council,

but of course we will be looking at everything which might be

presented to us by any member of the council," al-Kidwa told

reporters.

<p>

The United States, Israel's closest ally, has in the past

used its veto power -- or the threat of a veto -- to block

council action on Palestinian-backed resolutions, saying peace

efforts must come from the two sides.

<p>

Washington has announced plans to send its Middle East

envoy Anthony Zinni back to the region later this week to press

for a cease-fire, and Annan urged both sides to work closely

with Zinni toward a resumption of the peace process.

<p>

Israeli U.N. Ambassador Yehuda Lancry played down the

significance of Annan's demand that Israel withdraw from the

occupied Palestinian territories, saying Israel had already

agreed to do so in principle.

<p>

"In September 1993 we entered a process in order to

negotiate the end of the situation as it is with the

Palestinians. Even Prime Minister (Ariel) Sharon envisioned the

establishment of a Palestinian state," he told reporters.

<p>

"That is an equivalent to an end of the current

negotiations, on an agreed basis. Of course, we have to

negotiate this, so it is not a new development," Lancry said.

<p>

He said Israeli defense forces were "compelled" to follow

their current strategy by a relentless "Palestinian terrorist

campaign" and said Palestinian suicide bombings were often more

deadly and did more damage than the Israeli army.
