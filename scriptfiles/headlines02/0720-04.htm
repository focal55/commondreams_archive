<p>Five Iraqis were killed, including an infant and two women, and 17 wounded when US and British warplanes bombed southern Iraq, Iraqi officials said.</p>

<p>"Five citizens were killed and 17 injured when enemy (US and British) warplanes bombed civilian and services installations in Al-Diwaniya," 170 kilometers (105 miles) south of Baghdad, at 11:15 p.m. Thursday (1915 GMT), said a military spokesman, quoted by the official INA news agency.</p>

<p>He said the warplanes, which "flew in from Kuwaiti airspace, backed by an AWACS plane that flew in from Saudi airspace," staged "armed sorties" over 11 other localities in southern Iraq before being "forced to flee back to their bases" by Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery and missile fire.</p>

<p>State-run Baghdad Radio said earlier that the raids were carried out by US warplanes. The funerals of the five victims were held in Al-Qadissiya province on Friday afternoon, according to the radio.</p>

<p>INA said both US and British aircraft took part in "this new crime", which killed a 62-year-old man, Hamza Ghafel, and four members of one family, including a one-and-a-half-year-old girl.</p>

<p>It identified the four as Raheem Abd Hlaihel, 32, his wife Najiba Dayef, 32, Lamia Dayef, 30, and the child Hiba Raheem Abd Hlaihel.</p>

<p>There was no immediate word from the US military on the incident.</p>

<p>Almost daily skirmishes are reported in "no-fly" zones enforced by US and British warplanes over northern and southern Iraq since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

<p>On Monday, an Iraqi military spokesman said one person was killed and six were wounded in a US-British raid Sunday on "civilian installations" in the southern province of Najaf.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said the planes struck a mobile radar for a surface-to-air missile launcher. The radar was attacked with precision guided weapons after it was moved into the southern no-fly zone, the US Defense Department said.</p>

<p>Iraq says US-British raids in the air exclusion zones have now killed 1,483 Iraqis and wounded 1,400. Baghdad does not recognize the zones, which are not sanctioned by any UN resolution.</p>
