MOGADISHU -- "Black Hawk Down," the movie

that tells the story of the ill-fated US intervention

in Somalia in 1993, is a travesty of history and may

herald another military foray, a Somali gunman who

fought against the Americans said on Thursday. 



<p>The highlight of the picture, the pirated video

version of which "premiered" in Mogadishu cinemas on

Tuesday, is the shooting down by Somali fighters of

two US Black Hawk helicopters on October 3, 1993. 



<p>"The film is stupid and presents Somali leaders and

fighters as inhuman," said Mohamed Said Abdulle, one

of the gunmen who took part in the battle that claimed

the lives of 18 US soldiers and hundreds of Somalis.

"The fighting in Mogadishu was a legitimate defense

against foreign domination," he added. 



<p>He said the movie could be a gimmick to prepare the

American public for another US military strike against

Somalia, a country where, according to Washington,

terrorists might have found a safe haven. In one of

Mogadishu's makeshift cinemas, youths cheered the

scene showing a rocket-propelled grenade fired by

Somali gunmen hit one of the helicopters. 



<p>"The Americans killed hundreds of our people on that

day, but they still talk about 18 of their

servicemen," Abdulle said. 



<p>Another ex-gunman said the film had played down the

role of Malaysian and Pakistani troops who went to the

rescue of pinned-down American Rangers. 



<p>"If the Malaysian troops who also lost soldiers and

armored vehicles did not arrive to save the

Americans, casualties would have been higher on both

sides," said the former militiaman, who now runs a

shop. 



<p>For Ahmed Omar Jess, one of the commanders in the

Somali National Alliance, the movie is "just a matter

of history." 



<p>"We have no problem with the US," said Jess, one of

the warlords hunted by the US soldiers at that time.

"It was a beautiful piece of art. I appreciated what

they (moviemakers) did despite the errors. They need

to consult before hand to make the film more

realistic," said a moviegoer.</p>
