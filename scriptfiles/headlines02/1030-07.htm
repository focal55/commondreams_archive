In sprawling Williams Arena, where University of Minnesota maroon and gold gave 

way to Wellstone green, people of many places, stations and leanings came together 

Tuesday night for U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone.</P>

</table>A huge and sympathetic crowd of more than 20,000 people, a mass of state and 

national media, signs and songs and shouts of unrepentant liberalism -- it would 

have been a spectacular late-campaign rally.</P>

<P>But despite the hoots and whistles and proud smiles, despite the fist-pumping 

and the "Wellstone for Senate" banner that hung along one railing, it was a memorial 

for the spirited senator, killed in a plane crash Friday along with his wife, 

Sheila; their daughter, Marcia Markuson; three campaign aides, and the two pilots.</P>

<P>They gathered, former St. Paul Mayor George Latimer said as he opened the program, 

in hopes of "putting aside crushing grief in order to celebrate the lives that 

have been taken from us."</P>

<P>During the showing of a video of Wellstone highlights, to the sounds of Bob 

Dylan's "Forever Young," members of Wellstone's staff wept, some with their heads 

on others' shoulders.</P>

<P>As the video ended, a hush fell across the arena, broken only by the sounds 

of sniffling. Many wept, too, at poignant descriptions of the Wellstones and their 

love for each other, and of the style and wit and commitment of the people who 

died with them.</P>

</table></font></font>But much of the night was upbeat, raucous and sometimes acidly partisan, a 

campaign rally that left some Republicans and other non-DFLers squirming.</P>

<P>"Paul Wellstone wouldn't have it any other way," Latimer said.</P>

<P>Doors opened to the public at 4:30 p.m. In little more than an hour, the arena 

was declared full and people were directed to the nearby Sports Pavilion.</P> 

<P>Before the memorial started at 6:30, that overflow seating was gone, too, and 

many hundreds of people still waited outside.</P>

<P>"I'm disappointed they didn't have this in the Metrodome," said Howard Smith, 

45, of White Bear Lake, who worked on Wellstone's 1982 campaign for state auditor. 

"They could have filled this place five times."</P>

<P>Former U.S. Sen. Bob Kerry, D-Neb., walked along the line of people who weren't 

likely to get inside even the overflow hall, shaking hands and thanking them for 

coming.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="subhead">Cheers, a few boos </SPAN> </P>

<P>Former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and many members 

of Congress were among the last to take their seats -- to the strains of "Love 

Train," sung by Sounds of Blackness. As their faces flashed on a big screen, the 

audience cheered.</P>

<P>U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a close friend of Wellstone's, gave a fighting 

wave to the crowd as he walked to his seat on the floor, and the crowd cheered 

as if for a star's return to a basketball game.</P>

<P>The biggest cheer was for Walter Mondale, the former senator and vice president 

who is expected to announce today that he will seek to take Wellstone's place 

on the ticket. Moments later, scattered boos greeted Senate Minority Leader Trent 

Lott, R-Miss., as he entered the arena. Lott smiled and waved.</P>

<P>The hall quieted for the Wellstone sons, David and Mark, who talked of sharing 

baseball games, wrestling meets and quiet, serious talks with their parents.</P>

<P>"I could go on all night," David said. "I've got a little bit of my dad in 

me."</P>

<P>He talked about his father's integrity and intensity and the values of social 

justice that he instilled in his children.</P>

<P>"He was a wonderful father," David Wellstone said. "When the going really got 

rough, there was no one else you wanted in your corner. That goes for us, and 

it goes for all of you."</P>

</table></font>He shared memories of his mother's love for the music of Buddy Holly. He remembered 

"the wet washcloth on the forehead" and the long Saturdays she spent in wrestling 

gyms.</P>

<P>"Strong," he said. "That's what she was. My dad wouldn't be what he was without 

my mom."</P>

<P>Mark Wellstone had a message for his father, a message that started personal 

but, like many of the night's speeches, turned political:</P>

<P>"Dad, we're OK," he said. "Dave and I are OK. . . . We will carry on. We will 

see this legacy carry on."</P>

<P>The memorial-turned-rally ended -- more than an hour later than planned -- 

with a stemwinder by Harkin.</P>

<P>Wellstone "made a miner up on the Iron Range know that he was as important 

as the president of the United States," Harkin said, and "the decency he demanded 

of our society, he lived out in his own life."</P>

<P>Through all of Wellstone's work, "there weaves a common thread: helping people, 

especially ordinary, average people. He empowered them. He lifted them up."</P>

<P>Invoking the spirit of Wellstone's green bus, Harkin shouted out a boarding 

call.</P>

<P>"We must continue Paul's journey for justice in America!" he said. "Will you 

stand up, join together and board that bus? Say yes! For Paul Wellstone, will 

you stand up and keep fighting for social justice? Say yes!</P>

<P>"For Paul!" Harkin repeated, as the crowd took up the chant. "For Paul!"</P>

<P>Rick Kahn, one of Wellstone's closest friends, had set the tone earlier, urging 

the crowd to "stand up for all the people he fought for . . . for working men 

and women . . . for all those who lack the strength to stand up on their own." 

His words brought thousands to their feet including Clinton, who smiled, clapped, 

put a fist in the air and mouthed the words, "That's right."</P>

<P>TV cameras then panned to a beaming Mondale, which brought more cheers.</P>

<P>"If Paul Wellstone's legacy comes to an end, then our spirits will be crushed 

and we will drown in a river of tears," a clearly emotional Kahn said. "We are 

begging you, do not let that happen. We are begging you to help us win this Senate 

election for Paul Wellstone."</P>

<P>In a move that brought gasps of delight from some and stony silence from a 

few, Kahn then began urging select Republicans to drop their partisanship and 

work for Wellstone's reelection.</P>

<P>To U.S. Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn., Kahn said, "You know that Paul loved you. 

He needs you now. . . . Help us win this race."</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="subhead">For the little guys </SPAN> </P>

<P>It was a crowd flecked with celebrity and importance, but the mass was decidedly 

"little feller" -- the term Wellstone sometimes used for the people, not Rockefellers, 

he wanted to represent.</P>

<P>Josiah Titus, 23, one of the first people in line, said that he and his wife, 

Jamie, cut short their honeymoon in New York and drove home to Minneapolis to 

attend the memorial.</P>

</table></font>On the way, they read a copy of Wellstone's book, "The Conscience of a Liberal," 

which Josiah found Friday afternoon in a Manhattan bookstore.</P>

<P>"I grew up in a conservative community and I resented a lot of it," he said. 

"I thought I resented politics. But watching Paul Wellstone, I realized I was 

just seeing the wrong side."</P>

<P>He was a teenager but already tall when he met the new senator at the Minnesota 

State Fair in the early 1990s.</P>

<P>"He's tiny compared to me, but I left feeling that I had met the biggest person 

in the world." he said.</P>

<P>"Even if I never pursue a career in politics, I know from him that I can do 

something. Organizing, volunteering -- that will be a part of my life no matter 

if I'm a baker or a teacher or whatever."</P>

<P>People began queuing up outside the Minneapolis arena mid-afternoon, five and 

six abreast in a line that snaked out for blocks in the damp October chill.</P>

<P>Matte Kinsey, of Minneapolis, afraid she wouldn't find a parking space, pulled 

up near where the now-famous green campaign bus was parked, festooned with flowers, 

and pleaded with a traffic officer: "Please take a picture of the bus for me?" 

He did.</P>

<P>The venerable 1968 bus, a sentimental touchstone especially for Wellstone staff 

members and volunteers, bore a single empty chair -- the riderless horse -- and 

messages from a rainbow of constituencies: the Ethiopian community, the Vietnamese 

community, Minnesota's American Indian tribes, neighborhood organizations, social-action 

groups, veterans organizations.</P>

<P>Veterans caps and union jackets were common.</P>

<P>"He wasn't just pro-labor," said Jerry Waller, 42, a United Auto Workers member 

from Dodge Center, Minn. "He was <I>proud </I>of being pro-labor."</P>

<P>Gerry Castagner, 51, retired president of a steelworkers union local in the 

Virginia-Eveleth area, was on one of two chartered buses that brought more than 

100 steelworkers from the Iron Range, then gathered more in the Twin Cities. Other 

steelworkers came from throughout the country.</P>

<P>"Paul was our friend," Castagner said.</P>

</table>There were no separate lines for big-shots, and that suited state Sen. Linda 

Higgins, DFL-Minneapolis, just fine.</P>

<P>"I've been in line since 3:30," said Higgins, stamping her feet. "This is just 

a whole bunch of people from every walk of life who wanted to pay their respects, 

and we're all in this line together. That's pretty special and I think that's 

who Paul was."</P>

<P>Allison Dobson, a campaign staff worker, said that aside from seating for family 

and the congressional delegation, there would be no special VIP areas. "It's pretty 

much the first 20,000 people who get in," she said, before the service started.</P>

<P>Inside, former Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton sat a few rows above 

two workers for homeless vets.</P>

<P>"This is just the kind of crowd he would have wanted," she said, smiling. "I'm 

not surprised by the enormity of it. Paul was loved."</P>

<P>Jesse Jackson talked about Wellstone working as Minnesota coordinator for his 

1988 presidential race, and he joked about his absent-mindedness. "Paul would 

have a blue and green sock on if Sheila didn't dress him," he said.</P>

<P>People made their way to the arena individually and as families or in groups 

of friends. They were mayors, farmers, pipefitters, office workers. They came 

by bus and bicycle and on foot, from the neighborhoods of cities and from cities 

smaller than neighborhoods.</P>

<P>State Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia, was there. It's a matter of honor everywhere 

but seems especially true and vital on the Iron Range: You attend memorials for 

your friends and for people who shaped and inspired you.</P>

<P>Wellstone was on his way to Virginia, Minn., Friday to the funeral for Rukavina's 

father, Bennie, a man who organized steelworkers in the 1930s, when his plane 

crashed.</P>

<P>Although the tone of the memorial was often defiantly partisan, the audience 

included a number of Republican and independent figures, including Lott, Health 

and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, representing the Bush administration, 

GOP gubernatorial candidate Tim Pawlenty, Independence Party Gov. Jesse Ventura 

and Tim Penny, the IP candidate for governor.</P>

<P>Wellstone probably would have understood how they felt. In "The Conscience 

of a Liberal," he wrote about being the odd man at the funeral for U.S. Sen. Barry 

Goldwater, R-Arizona.</P>

<P>"I think many Republicans were surprised," he wrote. "They enjoyed giving me 

a rough time -- they even gave me Goldwater's 'The Conscience of a Conservative' 

to read on the plane."</P>

<P>Person after person waiting in line said that Wellstone represented better 

than anyone else what they want in a political leader: someone who is engaged 

and engaging, tireless on behalf of the weak, passionate and compassionate, able 

to laugh, able to cry.</P>

<P>"A man without tears is a man without a heart," Hubert Humphrey said in his 

last major speech in Minnesota before he died of cancer in 1978.</P>

<P>Humphrey's funeral in Minneapolis was the last time that official Washington 

came to Minnesota to honor a fallen statesman. The president who came then was 

Jimmy Carter, the senators named Javits, Percy, Muskie, McGovern, Church and Moynihan.</P>

<P>Walter Mondale -- then the vice president -- gave voice to the combination 

of grief and joyful gratitude that so many felt. "Hubert's heart kept its course 

truly," he said, borrowing a line from Shakespeare.</P>

<P>And for that, Carter said of Humphrey, "The joy of his memory will last far 

longer than the pain and sorrow of his leaving."</P>

<P>But there were great, heart-rending differences between the farewell of nearly 

25 years ago and Tuesday's goodbyes.</P>

<P>"We knew he was dying," a friend of Humphrey's wrote in 1978.</P>

<P>It didn't much soften the blow to those who loved Humphrey, but the suddenness 

of Wellstone's death, at the relatively young age of 58, seemed to make this wound 

even deeper, even more raw.</P>

<P>And Humphrey's wife, Muriel, soon to take his place in the Senate, was there 

to hear Mondale say, as if speaking to his mentor, "With her here, your spirit, 

your joy, your good heart remains with us."</P>

<P>On Tuesday night, the people said goodbye to Sheila Wellstone, too.</P>

<P>As she waited to get into the arena, Delrita Rudnitski, of the Minnesota Coalition 

for Battered Women, stood in line behind a banner thanking the Wellstones for 

their help.</P>

<P>"We're going to carry forward with the work in memory of them and in honor 

of them," Rudnitski said.</P>

<P>She caught sight of Lynn Rosenthal of the National Network to End Domestic 

Violence in Washington, D.C. The two women hugged, then cried together.</P>

<P>"Paul and Sheila were our heroes," Rosenthal said.</p>
