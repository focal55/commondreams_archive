<p>Britain's ambassador to Israel has angered its government by describing the 

Palestinian territories as "the largest detention camp in the world".</p>

<p class="story">Sherard Cowper-Coles accused soldiers of humiliating and harassing 

civilians. He put his complaints to Maj-Gen Amos Gilad, the officer in charge 

of the welfare of Palestinians under occupation, after a tour of the West Bank 

which he is said to have found shocking.</p>

<p class="story">After his comments were leaked to the press yesterday, a senior 

Israeli official said: "The ambassador has forgotten that the British mandate 

is over. He went too far."</p>

<p class="story">British officials said the criticisms were coordinated with Whitehall 

after Gen Gilad visited London, where he was asked to explain why 3.5 million 

Palestinians were effectively locked up.</p>

<p class="story">"The ambassador expressed strong understanding for the need to 

crack down on terrorism and praised the Israeli officer corps," one official said.</p>

<p class="story">"But he said that the behavior of some ordinary soldiers at checkpoints 

was unacceptable."</p>

<p class="story">Although Israel has directed its anger at Mr Cowper-Coles, his 

criticism is part of an Anglo-American campaign. </p>

<p class="story">Last week the American ambassador, Dan Kurtzer, delivered a letter 

to Ariel Sharon, the prime minister, calling for more freedom of movement for 

the Palestinians and an end to the killing of civilians by the army.</p>

<p class="story">Mr Cowper-Coles said: "This conversation was part of a private 

dialogue between friends. We do not publicly lecture our Israeli friends. We do 

not believe in megaphone diplomacy."</p>

<p class="story">The ambassador is seen as a sympathetic figure in Israel, thanks 

to his troubling to learn Hebrew. Last Sunday he appeared on a hard-hitting satirical 

television program, arriving at the studio in a London taxi, carrying a rolled 

umbrella and wearing a trilby.</p>

<p class="story">Mr Sharon responded to the criticism in a speech to parliament 

yesterday by blaming the Palestinian leadership for the plight of the population.</p>

<p class="story">Addressing the Palestinians, he said: "Your terrible pain is 

unnecessary. Your sacrifices are unnecessary. The blood you have spilled has been 

spilled in vain. Change the regime of tyranny that leads you from defeat to defeat, 

from disaster to disaster."</p>
