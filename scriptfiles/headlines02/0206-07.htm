The United States should refuse to hand over some US$500 million in military aid to Colombia due to its failure to fulfill conditions attached to the funds, said leading human rights groups Tuesday.

<p>In a joint press conference, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human Rights Watch</a>, 



and the <a href="http://www.wola.org/" target="_new">Washington Office on Latin America</a> (WOLA) maintained that 



Colombia has failed to meet human-rights performance conditions set by the U.S. Congress in 1999.

<p>







The requirements include suspending the worst human rights abusers from 



the armed forces, severing ties between the military and right-wing 



paramilitary groups, and ensuring that military officials cooperate with civilian authorities seeking to punish rights abusers.

<p>







"The facts are clear. Colombia has not met the conditions," said 



Alexandra Arriaga, director of Amnesty International's government relations division, citing evidence laid out in a recent 32-page report published jointly by the three groups.

<p>







The report documents Colombia's noncompliance with U.S. 



requirements through grisly details of massacres carried out by paramilitary groups allegedly in collusion with the armed forces, and the murders or "disappearances" of a dozen civilian prosecutors, investigators, and witnesses involved in cases brought against paramilitaries.

<p>







The requirement that officers against whom there is "credible evidence" 



of grave rights abuses be suspended has also been skirted, as known 



abusers and paramilitary collaborators continue to hold high-ranking posts in the army, according to the report.

<p>







Other rights groups have substantiated the report's findings, including 



the Colombia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which concluded that Colombia's paramilitaries rely on coordination and tolerance from the armed forces after a visit in December 2001.

<p>







Continuing to fund the Colombian military, the rights groups argue, 



"would send the message that the U.S. government is willing to turn a 



blind eye to human rights violations and allow Colombia to continue down a familiar path of impunity, violence, and terror."

<p>







State Department officials met last week with the three groups and 



other organizations concerned with human rights and U.S. foreign policy to discuss the report's findings. A final decision by the department on aid to Colombia is expected within a month.

<p>







However, in the 2003 budget released Monday, the administration of President George W. Bush asked for an additional US&#36;98 million in training and equipment for the Colombian military.

<p>







U.S. government policy since the mid-1990s has been to aid Colombia's 



military in its battle against drug traffickers and several guerrilla 



groups. As a result, Colombia has become the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid funds, after Israel and Egypt.

<p>







Coletta Youngers, a Colombia analyst at WOLA commented that aid 



authorization for Colombia puts the U.S. government "between a rock and a hard place; between being honest and disrupting the aid flow or 



misrepresenting the facts in order to keep the aid spigot open."
