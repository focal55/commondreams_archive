<p>MIAMI - John Bolton, undersecretary of state for arms control, caused a stir 

in May by accusing the Cuban government of transferring bioweapons technology 

to rogue nations. Nineteen months ago, he caused a different stir - bursting into 

a Tallahassee library on behalf of the Bush-Cheney campaign to stop a recount 

of Miami-Dade County ballots. 

<P> ''I'm with the Bush-Cheney team, and I'm here to stop the count,'' he was 

quoted as saying in news reports at the time. 

<P> Matt Schlapp, a former congressional aide, is White House special assistant 

to the president and deputy director of political affairs. In November 2000, he 

was part of the supposedly spontaneous window-pounding protest at Miami-Dade County 

Hall that brought to an end the first recount of Miami-Dade ballots. 

<P> Sue Cobb, a Coral Gables developer, today is the US ambassador to Jamaica. 

Twenty months ago, the generous Republican donor volunteered her legal skills 

to the Bush-Cheney campaign - working as part of the legal team that contested 

recounts in Miami-Dade. 

<P> Although they now serve President Bush in sharply different roles, they are 

among more than 50 political appointees found by the Miami Herald to have served 

as troops in the frantic Florida recount battle that followed the Nov. 7, 2000, 

election. 

<P> Political patronage has long been a reward for campaign loyalty. But the distribution 

of plum jobs to those who worked in Florida after the 2000 election suggests that 

that service became a kind of political merit badge that carried a special benefit. 

<P> ''Work on the recount is the indispensable connection for work at the Bush 

administration,'' said Jeffrey Toobin, author of ''Too Close to Call: The 36-Day 

Battle to Decide the 2000 Election.'' 

<P> Just how many Bush appointees actually served the Bush-Cheney campaign in 

Florida is unclear. The White House declined to provide a list of administration 

officials who worked for the Florida campaign. 

<P> Florida lawyer Barry Richard, a Democrat who was hired by the Bush campaign 

to fight its legal battle over the recount, said there were 192 lawyers of record 

on various court cases around the state. 

<P> To identify the appointees, the Miami Herald conducted dozens of interviews 

and studied White House nominations and government staff directories - then matched 

names to news accounts, photo captions, and several books about the episode. In 

addition, some appointees included their recount roles in news releases, or accounts 

in university and law journals. 

<P> Most were lawyers who worked all-nighters in Tallahassee and across South 

Florida as ballot observers and political operatives as well as litigators and 

behind-the-scenes writers of legal briefs. 

<P> White House officials defended the appointments, noting that many appointees 

take big pay cuts when they move into government jobs. Appointees with Florida 

service to the Bush-Cheney recount effort make from $52,300 a year to $166,700 

for Attorney General John Ashcroft, who also passed through Tallahassee during 

the recount. 

<P> Several of the people who served as political operatives and lawyers say there 

was no explicit quid pro quo in their decision to come to Florida to do battle 

with the forces of Democratic candidates Al Gore and Joseph I. Lieberman. But 

they acknowledged that the service helped them draw the attention of the Bush 

team. 

<P> The Florida team included major figures in the Bush administration, notably 

Theodore Olson, the current solicitor general, who worked on the case in both 

Tallahassee and Miami, then argued candidate Bush's case before the US Supreme 

Court, and Robert Zoellick, now the US trade representative, who served as a virtual 

chief of staff to James Baker, Bush's main Florida strategist. 

<P> There are many whose roles in Florida went largely unremarked at the time: 

<P> Five lawyers who did research and wrote briefs to fight Florida court challenges 

are now deputies in the White House counsel's office. 

<P> Three senior strategists in Tallahassee now hold $130,000-a-year jobs as general 

counsels to Cabinet departments. 

<P> Three members of the window-pounding crowd that on Thanksgiving Eve helped 

persuade the Miami-Dade County canvassing board to abandon the recount are now 

members of the White House staff. 

<P> Former Texas Transportation System chairman David Laney left his Austin law 

firm to serve as a ballot recount observer in Volusia County. Bush appointed him 

recently to the seven-member Amtrak Board of Directors, a federal post touted 

by Laney's firm as a ''leadership role in the transportation arena.'' It has no 

salary but pays a per diem and travel expenses. 

<P> Kevin Martin, now a $130,000-a-year commissioner at the Federal Communications 

Commission, was one of the first Bush-Cheney people to arrive in Miami from Washington, 

on Nov. 8. 

<P> New York lawyer Brad Blakeman, who helped organize protests in South Florida 

and appeared in one Associated Press dispatch at the time as a ''Broward County 

GOP volunteer,'' today is director of White House scheduling. 

<P> Stuart A. Levey, associate deputy attorney general, represented Bush-Cheney 

in Martin County. 

<P> Boca Raton developer Ned L. Siegel, long a generous GOP donor, has been nominated 

by Bush to serve as a director of the Overseas Private Investment Corp. During 

the recount crisis, he sued Theresa LePore, Palm Beach County supervisor of elections, 

in a bid to stop the manual recount of the troubled butterfly ballots on constitutional 

grounds.
