BAGHDAD - Iraqi newspapers Sunday blasted

suggestions that the United States might target Iraq in its war

against terrorism and said Washington itself was a threat to

world stability.

<p>The official al-Qadissiya newspaper condemned ``U.S. threats

against the so-called rogue nations'' which include Iraq.

<p>``The Americans have once again repeated their threats ...

American officials have repeatedly threatened Iraq and other

nations saying that these countries threaten their stability,

while Washington is the one which threatens world stability,''

it added.

<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Burns said on

Saturday the United States had yet to decide whether to use

military force against Iraq and that Washington planned to

discuss the issue with its allies from the 1991 Gulf War.

<p>Speculation has intensified that the United States could

start a new phase in its war on terrorism after Afghanistan  by

attacking such countries as Somalia, Iraq or Sudan.

<p>Iraq, which is on a U.S. list of states sponsoring

terrorism, denies any links to international terrorism.

<p>President Bush  recently warned that Iraqi President Saddam

Hussein  would ``find out'' the consequences if he did not allow

the return to Baghdad of United Nations  weapons inspectors,

triggering speculation that Iraq might be the next target of

U.S. forces.

<p>The ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra said Washington

wanted to use the issue of weapons inspectors as a pretext to

attack Iraq.

<p>``Accusations by U.S. officials that Iraq is developing

weapons of mass destruction are false and aim at achieving

other goals,'' the paper said in a front-page editorial.

<p>The U.N. inspectors left Iraq in December 1998, shortly

before a U.S.-British bombing campaign, and have not been

allowed to return since.

<p>Iraq, still under international sanctions over its 1990

invasion of Kuwait, says it has no weapons of mass destruction

and wants a complete end to the U.N. embargo.

<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri did not answer a question

posed by Iraqi television Saturday night on whether Iraq would

allow the inspectors to resume work.

<p>Sabri was quoted by the pan-Arab al-Hayat newspaper on

Wednesday as saying that his government was studying a Russian

proposal to allow the inspectors back in return for suspending

U.N. sanctions and gradually lifting them.
