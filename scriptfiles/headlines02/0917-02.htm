<p>FOIX, France - Borrowing a centuries-old symbol of French peasant protest, 

radical farmer Jose Bove and eight others wore girls' frocks to their trial Tuesday 

for destroying a field of genetically modified crops.

</table></font></font>Bove, a star of the anti-globalization movement, faces up  to five years prison and a maximum fine of nearly $15,000 for  taking part in an April 2000 attack on a field of GM rapeseed  in the southwest town of Gaudies by some 400 anti-GM  protesters.<p>Some 

200 years ago, poachers in the region wore white frocks to fool gamekeepers trying 

to enforce a ban on men entering the forest. They were known as the "demoiselles," 

or maidens.

<p>"Our battle against GM crops has much in common with that  of the demoiselles -- we too are running up against a French  justice system opposed to common protest action and deaf to the  concerns of the population," Bove told reporters as he entered  the court in Foix, 20 miles north of the Spanish border.<p>Up to 500 supporters cheered Bove and his co-defendants as  he entered the court room.<p>While sharing a widespread European suspicion of GM crops,  France has permitted GM experiments on around 100 sites.<p>Bove says the government is underestimating the risks of  cross-pollination with natural crops. He defends the Gaudies  and similar attacks by invoking the French legal concept of a  "state of necessity" compelling citizen action even if it is  unlawful.<p>The pipe-smoking Bove completed a three-month sentence last  month for trashing a restaurant of the U.S. chain McDonalds to  protest against U.S. tariffs imposed on French specialty food  products and fast-food culture.<p>The CETIOM public research body which planted the 6.1-acre  rapeseed field a year before the attack is pressing charges for  destruction and damage to property.<p>It contends the location and small size of the field meant  there was no risk of irreversible impact on the environment.<p>Center Director Andre Pouzet added in a newspaper interview  Sunday that the experiment was unique in Europe and aimed to  help the government reach a decision over the issue of GM  crops.

<p>The verdict is likely to be deferred to a later date after the one-day hearing. 

Bove has already been handed a six-month jail sentence for a similar attack in 

1999 but has launched an appeal to France's highest court, the Cour de Cassation.
