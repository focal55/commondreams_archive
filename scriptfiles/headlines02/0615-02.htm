<p>BAGHDAD  - 

U.S. and British warplanes staged an

attack on southern Iraq on Friday that Baghdad said struck

civilian targets and Washington called a response to threats

against western aircraft patrolling a "no-fly" zone.

<p>

The U.S. Central Command, based in Tampa, Florida, said in

a statement that warplanes attacked a military air defense

radar facility in response to attempts to shoot down U.S. and

British warplanes on Thursday.

</table></font>Damage to the radar command and control target at Al

Amarah, about 165 miles southeast of Baghdad, was still being

determined, the command said.

<p>

An Iraqi military spokesman said in a statement carried by

the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) that the planes carried

out 42 sorties from bases in Kuwait at 11:20 a.m. on Friday and

flew over the provinces of Basra, Nassiriya, Samawa, Amarah and

other areas in the south of the country.

<p>

"The enemy attacked our civilian and service installations

in Amarah," the spokesman said.

<p>

The U.S. military had said the attack took place at 1:20

p.m. Iraq time.

<p>

No casualties were reported.

<p>

The spokesman said Iraq's ground air defenses fired at the

planes and forced them to return to their bases.

<p>

The attack was the latest in a long series of tit-for-tat

exchanges in policing by western warplanes of no-fly zones in

northern and southern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War  came.

<p>

Baghdad last reported firing by U.S. and British aircraft

on the south of the country was on May 31, when it said three

people were wounded.

<p>

MORE FREQUENT

<p>

Such exchanges have become more frequent in recent months

amid speculation that the United States might be preparing to

invade Iraq to overthrow President Saddam Hussein, accused by

Washington of developing weapons of mass destruction and

sponsoring terrorism.

<p>

British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said in Brussels last

week that Iraq, which does not recognize the no-fly zones, had

become more aggressive in threatening U.S. and British jets. He

also stressed after talks with Defense Secretary Donald

Rumsfeld that he was specifically referring to action related

to the no-fly zones and not any broader attack.

<p>

Iraq's al-Thawra newspaper on Friday ratcheted up rhetoric

against the no-fly zones, saying Iraq had the right to develop

its means to confront the western aircraft.

<p>

"What the American and British planes do is not an

'international mission' but a hostile act against Iraq in

violation of U.N. charter and rules of the international law,"

al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Party, said in a

front page editorial.

<p>

"Iraq has the right to confront this aggression according

to the U.N. charter and international law and develop all its

means to confront it regardless of what would happen to the

American and British pilots who violate its air space and

perpetrate crimes of killing and destruction," it added.

<p>

"This is what every independent state does toward those who

threaten its sovereignty," the paper added.</p>
