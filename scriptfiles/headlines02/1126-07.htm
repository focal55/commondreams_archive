<p>GENEVA, Switzerland - The United States Monday pulled out of a United Nations 

conference to finalize an international agreement that will provide the public 

with greater access to information about sources of pollution. 

<p> The treaty will require participating countries to collect and publish information 

on the quantities of pollutants released from certain industrial sources.

The U.S. delegation announced at Monday morning's session that it would not formally 

join the negotiations of a working group to the United Nations Economic Commission 

for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in 

Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, also known as 

the Aarhus Convention. 

<p> A source familiar with the U.S. position said the United States believes the 

proposals for pollution release and transfer registers do not go far enough. 

<p> One of the primary U.S. concerns is that that several European countries favor 

a system that reports waste without specifying specific pollutants, rather than 

one that details individual pollutants. 

<p> The U.S. delegation withdrew because it does not see the model emerging from 

the meeting as a good global model, the source said. 

<p> The Aarhus Convention's working group on pollution release and transfer registers 

is meeting this week in Geneva to hammer out the final details of the public information 

protocol. 

<p> It will cover information on the disposal, storage, recycling and treatment 

of industrial pollutants. The information will be compiled into publicly available 

pollutant release and transfer registers. 

<p> According to its statement, the U.S. delegation believes that the text of 

the resolution does not adequately address several areas, including public access 

to chemical-specific information concerning transfers of wastes. 

<p> While the United States has neither signed nor ratified the Aarhus Convention, 

a U.S. delegation had participated in talks leading up to this week's meeting, 

which is the seventh meeting of the working group on pollutant release and transfer 

registers. 

<p> Environmentalists are upset with the U.S. withdrawal because it is one of 

a few nations that already has a well established system of pollution reporting. 

The U.S. Toxics Release Inventory was set up in 1986 and is a publicly available 

database from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It contains information 

on releases of some 650 chemicals and chemical categories from industries including 

manufacturing, metal and coal mining, electric utilities, hazardous waste and 

others. 

<p> "This is very disappointing news. The U.S. departure increases the likelihood 

that this new right-to-know law will be a weak instrument, and unfortunately strengthens 

the EU [European Union] countries' hand," said Friends of the Earth pollution 

researcher Mary Taylor, speaking on behalf of the coalition of nongovernmental 

organizations European ECO Forum. 

<p> "Issues now at risk include draft text concerning the public's right to know 

about on-site disposal and off-site destinations of hazardous wastes," Taylor 

said. 

<p> U.S. State Department officials declined to comment. 

<p> Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups sounded warnings ahead 

of this week's meeting as they believe several European countries are looking 

for ways to weaken the new protocol by excluding some chemicals and radioactive 

waste. 

<p> The majority of issues must be finalized during this meeting, including the 

final list of chemicals and whether the disposal or storage of hazardous chemicals 

on-site should be included. 

<p> There is also debate over whether some chemicals linked to cancer should be 

excluded from the registers, and the exact list of industries and activities to 

be covered is yet to be determined. 

<p> Most Parties to the convention are opposed to including nuclear facilities 

under the treaty. 

<p> "The protocol should be a step forward for many countries, but the lack of 

ambition - particularly from the EU - is dismal," Taylor said. 

<p> "The public should have the right to know what chemicals are being discharged 

by companies and where they are being stored," she said. "Protecting certain sectors 

such as the nuclear industry from public scrutiny, or avoiding the inclusion of 

cancer causing chemicals, is scandalous." 

<p> In addition, environmentalists are specifically concerned that parties aim 

to exclude from the registers beryllium, chromium VI and styrene. 

<p> Beryllium is a lightweight metal commonly used in electronic appliances, golf 

clubs and non-sparking tools. It is found in coal, oil, certain rock minerals, 

volcanic dust, and soil. Beryllium is toxic and can cause lung cancer and skin 

disease. 

<p> Chromium is produced by burning coal and fossil fuels; it is used in stainless 

steel plating, chrome plating and leather tanning. Manufacturing or disposal of 

products or chemical containing chromium, releases chromium VI, a carcinogen, 

into the air, soil and water. 

<p> Styrene is a synthetic chemical used in rubber, plastics, insulation, fiberglass 

and auto parts. It is considered a possible carcinogen, and some studies of people 

who work closely with styrene have shown that breathing it may cause leukemia. 

<p> The Aarhus Convention was signed in 1998 by 35 countries from Europe and Central 

Asia and is named for the Danish city where the signing occurred. It is open to 

countries within the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) as well as to states 

having consultative status with the ECE. This includes the United States and Canada. 

<p> The convention requires signatories to provide environmental information to 

the public unless it would adversely impact international relations, security 

and national defense. It covers the energy sector, the mineral and chemical industries, 

waste management, industrial plants, dams, quarries, and the release of genetically 

modified organisms. 

<p> By June 2001, 17 countries had ratified the convention, and it entered into 

effect on October 30, 2001. Five more have ratified the treaty since then. 

<p> The United Nations touts the Aarhus Convention as a new kind of environmental 

agreement, one that links environmental rights with human rights. It acknowledges 

that humanity owes an obligation to future generations and establishes that sustainable 

development can be achieved only through the involvement of all stakeholders. 

<p> United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has hailed the Aarhus Convention 

as the "the most ambitious venture in the area of environmental democracy so far 

undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations." 

<p> "Although regional in scope, the significance of the Aarhus Convention is 

global," Annan said. "It is by far the most impressive elaboration of principle 

10 of the Rio Declaration, which stresses the need for citizen's participation 

in environmental issues and for access to information on the environment held 

by public authorities." 

<p> Annan has described the Aarhus Convention as a giant step forward in the development 

of international law in the environmental field. 

<p> It is the first international, legally binding mechanism for access to information, 

public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental 

matters. 

<p> This meeting of the convention's working group on pollution release and transfer 

registers will continue through November 29. The final version of the protocol 

is expected to be formally voted on by the convention's parties at a May 2003 

meeting in Kiev, Ukraine.
