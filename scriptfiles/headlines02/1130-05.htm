<p>PORTSMOUTH- Anti-war protesters plastered their clothing with anti-war slogans 

such as, "Santa Hates War, Don’t Buy It," and "Going at a Great Price: Peace," 

and headed out to walk among the shopping masses Friday. 

<P> "Part of the reason we’re doing this is that it is a very busy shopping day," 

protester Amy Antonucci said. "But it’s also the beginning of the Christmas season, 

which is supposed to be about caring for your neighbor and peace. 

<P> "Bombing a country of already impoverished people was not ‘peaceful’ or ‘caring’ 

last time I checked." 

<P> Other shoppers looked alternately pleased and confused as the group of about 

10 activists circled Market Square in Portsmouth Friday afternoon after having 

been ejected from the Fox Run Mall earlier in the day. 

<P> On Friday morning, Fox Run Mall marketing manager Linda Frink had said that 

so long as the protesters did not bother customers or attempt to hand out any 

materials, she didn’t believe there would be any problems. 

<P> The protesters said they were asked to leave by mall security because of the 

mall’s "no solicitation" rule. Recognizing that they were on private property, 

the activists left peaceably for the public - albeit freezing - streets of downtown 

Portsmouth. 

<P> "Even if we were only there for a little while, it’s enough to just be seen," 

protester Jennifer Fitzsimmons said. "That’s a reminder to people that while they 

shop and relax, some very ugly things are happening on the other side of the world." 

<P> One of the protesters, David Diamond, said Friday’s protest was "cut from 

the same cloth" as Adbuster Magazine’s Buy Nothing Day, which encourages people 

to not shop on the Friday after Thanksgiving to protest what they see as out-of-control 

consumerism. 

<P> "When you look at the war in Iraq, which in large part is over oil, it is 

actually quite related," Diamond said. "We need to look at how our choices and 

purchases affect the world around us." 

<P> Karina Beadling, of Seattle, Wash., said she was happy to see people across 

the country joining the anti-war movement. 

<P> "People everywhere need to spread the word," she said. "Unconditional support 

of President Bush has ramifications people haven’t even considered. It’s just 

going to continue the cycle of violence, creating orphans who will become terrorists." 

<P> Andrew Smiler, sporting a sticker reading, "Job Available: Peace Work," agreed. 

<P> "The current war has given America the chance to be terrorists," he said. 

"We just killed six men in Yemen without a trial, without asking any questions, 

without anything. That’s terrorism." 

<P> Carolyn Miller said her shirt’s quote, "Be an Instrument of Peace," embodied 

a theme of the work of Saint Francis of Assisi. 

<P> "That’s why I’m out here in the cold," she said. "I’m just trying to live 

up to that example and fight for peace." </p>
