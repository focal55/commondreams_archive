Israeli government has ordered an urgent assessment of whether its politicians 

and soldiers could face arrest and trial for war crimes while travelling abroad. 

<P>The move follows a report by the justice ministry that singled out Britain, 

Spain and Belgium as the most likely to prosecute Israeli officials who breach 

international law. But the government fears there is a growing trend towards global 

justice that could see Israelis effectively barred from visiting a host of states. 

<P>"We are building a map of all those countries that might give us a headache," 

said Ra'anan Gissin, spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. "They 

want to arrest Israelis who are enforcing the law while the real war criminals, 

like Saddam Hussein and Yasser Arafat, get away scot free." 

<P>The report was ordered after lawyers presented the cabinet with a report commissioned 

in the wake of a failed legal action in the Belgian courts last year accusing 

Mr Sharon of war crimes over the massacres of Palestinians in refugee camps 20 

years ago. 

<P>Last month, Scotland Yard launched an investigation of Israel's new defence 

minister, Lieutenant General Shaul Mofaz, during his short visit to Britain. 

<P>Amnesty International has called on signatories to the Geneva conventions to 

put on trial Israeli soldiers "responsible for war crimes" as defined in the Geneva 

conventions, such as unlawful killings, torture and the use of Palestinians as 

human shields in Jenin and Nablus earlier this year. 

<P><B>&#183;</B> Binyamin Netanyahu, the new Israeli foreign minister, yesterday 

called for Mr Arafat's removal after a gunman killed five Israelis, including 

a mother and two children, in a kibbutz on Sunday.
