<p>SEOUL, South Korea &#150;&#150;  Unleashing a new verbal attack on Washington a day after a bloody naval clash with South Korea, North Korea accused the United States Sunday of plotting a "preemtive strike" against the communist country.<P>The North Korean criticism came in response to President Bush's remarks early this month that the United States will strike pre-emptively against suspected terrorists if necessary.<P>The North, however, did not mention Saturday's naval skirmish with South Korea in which a North Korean navy boat sank a Southern patrol boat in the western sea, killing four of its crew and wounding 19 others. One was missing.<P>North Korea, along with Iran and Iraq, were labeled by Bush to be part of "an axis of evil" countries with intentions to develop weapons of mass destruction.<P>Saturday's naval clash was the most serious border clash in recent years. The United States expressed for support for South Korea hours after the 21-minute skirmish.<P>The Koreas were divided in 1945, and share the world's most heavily armed border. The United States keeps 37,000 troops in South Korea as a deterrent against North Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.
