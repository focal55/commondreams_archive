<p>Iraqi television has been showing pictures of joyful prisoners leaving  jail, shortly after the authorities announced an unprecedented general amnesty. 

<P>

A nationally televised statement  from the Revolution Command Council, read by Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said the "full and complete and final amnesty" applied to "any Iraqi imprisoned or arrested for political or any other reason".

The first releases came swiftly after the announcement<br>

</table></font>The amnesty was intended to thank the Iraqi people for their "unanimity" in 

last week's presidential referendum, the statement said. 

<P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein won 100% support in the poll, in which he was 

the only candidate. 

<P> The amnesty also included "prisoners, detainees and fugitives... including 

those under sentence of death, inside or outside Iraq," the statement said. 

<P> The exception, the statement said, was for murderers, who would be released 

only with the consent of the victims' families. 

<P> <B>Joyful scenes</B> 

<P> Soon after the statement, Iraqi television began showed footage of dozens 

of prisoners rushing out of various prison gates chanting support for Saddam Hussein. 

<P> There is no way of verifying how many prisoners have been released.. 

<P> Human rights groups accuse Iraq of detaining tens of thousands of its citizens 

as political prisoners over the years, although many are thought to have been 

executed. 

<P> In April, the UN Human Rights Commission condemned Iraq for conducting a campaign 

of "all pervasive repression and widespread terror". 

<P> It demanded that Baghdad should immediately put an end to its "summary and 

arbitrary executions... the use of rape as a political tool and all enforced and 

involuntary disappearances". 

<P> <B>Regime change</B> 

<P> Analysts see the amnesty and referendum as a concerted effort by the Iraqi 

Government to rally domestic and international opposition to US demands for a 

change of regime in Baghdad. In his UN speech on Iraq last month, US President 

George W Bush demanded that the leadership end internal oppression in Iraq, as 

well as stop its alleged programme to develop weapons of mass destruction. 

<P> Also this week, Iraq has taken steps to return Kuwait's national archive which 

was looted by Iraqi forces during the 1990-91 Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. 

<P> The first box of documents was handed over in the demilitarised border zone 

along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti frontier under UN supervision on Sunday. 

<P> There is no indications whether any of the 600 Kuwaitis - missing since 1991 

and alleged by Kuwait to be still being held in Iraq as prisoners of war - are 

among those released on Sunday. 

<P> Iraq says it has lost track of those prisoners. </p>
