<p>A US-British diplomatic drive to win support from key world powers for a snap strike on Iraq faced a hard sell in Moscow after crashing in France, while anti-war protests gathered steam.</p>

<p>US State Department official Marc Grossman was to arrive later Saturday in Moscow in a bid to persuade Russian officials to back a strongly worded UN resolution to disarm Iraq.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported that Washington's draft of the resolution would give Iraq just seven days to agree and 23 more days to open up totally to inspections or face military strikes.</p>

</table></font>Meanwhile in London, more than 100,000 protestors were expected to turn out for a "Don't Attack Iraq" demonstration that organizers hope will be one of the biggest anti-war marches ever in Europe.</p>

<p>Some 1,000 people marched through Sydney on Saturday to oppose Australian involvement in any military action against Iraq, chanting "no blood for oil".</p>

<p>And 2,000 anti-war protestors gathered Friday outside a Republican fundraiser in Denver, Colorado, where US President George W. Bush defended himself against charges of war-mongering.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to give peace a chance to work. I want the United Nations to work," Bush said.</p>

<p>But he cautioned that if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein did not disarm on US terms, Washington would commit troops and do the job.</p>

<p>Clearly setting the tone for a tough mission for Grossman, the Russian foreign ministry put out a statement hailing efforts by Iraq and the United Nation to resume arms inspections.</p>

<p>Russia "hails both sides' intent to carry out a responsible and constructive dialogue" and "deems it essential to guarantee that (these talks) produce substantial results so as to speed up the deployment of inspection units on Iraqi territory," the ministry said.</p>

<p>The UN's chief arms inspector was to hold talks in Vienna on Monday with Iraqi officials.</p>

<p>Hans Blix, chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), was to reopen negotiations on practical details of resuming work in Iraq after a gap of four years.</p>

<p>However, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday said there was no "clear proof" to back up US and British claims of a weapons build-up in Iraq.</p>

            <p>Delaying the departure of the UN weapons inspectors to Iraq would be an "unforgivable 

              error", Ivanov said.</p>

<p>And he added that Russia had received "not one element of proof" to back up US and British charges that Iraq had ties with the al-Qaeda Islamic extremist network.</p>

<p>Russia insists that the issue of Iraq should be resolved by political and diplomatic means.</p>

<p>Grossman, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, who is accompanied by a British envoy, Peter Ricketts, political director at the Foreign Office, had already met a brickwall in Paris on Friday.</p>

<p>Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, speaking in the French capital, warned Washington against an attack on Iraq, "otherwise, the consequences will be incalculable."</p>

<p>And while Zhu urged Iraq to "cooperate unconditionally with the United Nations" he made it clear he preferred to "respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq".</p>

<p>"If arms inspections do not take place, if there is not clear proof and if there is no authorization from the Security Council, there cannot be a military attack on Iraq," Zhu said after talks with French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin.</p>

<p>Grossman also held talks in Paris to seek French support for a new UN resolution to force Iraq to disarm.</p>

<p>Bush himself spoke to his French counterpart by telephone, but Jacques Chirac remained opposed to any UN resolution that provides for the automatic use of military force if Iraq fails to cooperate with UN demands.</p>

            <p>France favored a resolution that was "simple and firm, showing the unity and 

              determination of the international community" to get weapons inspectors 

              back into Iraq, according to Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.</p>

<p>As permanent members of the UN Security Council, France, Russia and China all have veto power on any UN resolution.</p>

<p>In Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz warned the United States will suffer huge casualties if Iraq is attacked.</p>

<p>"Iraq will fight," Aziz vowed.</p>

<p>"The assault against Iraq will not be a cakewalk for the Americans but a fierce war during which the United States will suffer losses they have never sustained for decades," he said.</p>

            <p>Aziz had Friday voiced Iraq's determination to defend itself, but 

              added that Baghdad no longer possessed missiles with a range long 

              enough to hit Israel.</p>
