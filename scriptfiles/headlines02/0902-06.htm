<p>NOT long ago, before the accounting scandals at Enron, WorldComand other companies, 

workers often saw themselves as management's best buddies. Gone was the old, us-against-them 

mentality in which workers viewed C.E.O.'s as robber barons intent on squeezing 

them for every last dollar. </p>

<P> In its place was a new world in which workers, with their stock options and 

401(k) plans loaded with company stock, saw themselves as allied with management, 

not opposed to it. Pointing to the dot-com phenomenon, management theorists talked 

of a New Economy paradigm in which workers would link arms with executives because 

they were just as eager as their bosses to maximize company profits and stock 

prices.</p>

<P> The notion of worker exploitation was largely forgotten, at least among white-collar 

and high-technology employees, because it seemed so Old Economy. Corporate executives 

fostered an egalitarian atmosphere by using the same cafeterias and parking lots 

as their subordinates. They embraced an inclusive vocabulary in which workers 

were partners, associates, even fellow entrepreneurs, and to make workers identify 

with them, managers rewarded their new partners with stock options, bonuses and 

discount stock purchase plans. </p>

<P> "In the 90's, half of American households became investors, so the line between 

being an employee and an investor began to blur," former Labor Secretary Robert 

B. Reich said. "People were happy because it looked as if a rapidly rising tide 

was lifting all boats." Workers hardly seemed to worry about the need for workplace 

protections. With the economy and Wall Street booming, it seemed silly to fret 

about layoffs. Workers were busy boasting about, not worrying about, the size 

of their retirement nest eggs.</p>

<P> To this new species of investor-worker, unions seemed irrelevant. Unions made 

little headway as they sought to lure workers by promising the basic protections 

coveted in decades past, like health coverage and defined-benefit pensions. Union 

membership remained flat even as the 1990's boom created more than 15 million 

jobs. For many workers, the collective approach seemed anachronistic because they 

were confident that management would protect them or they could protect themselves. 

</p>

<P> This logic seemed unassailable during the boom. But the paradigm began to 

crack with the high-tech bust and resulting layoffs, and crumbled with the recession 

and the Enron-led wave of scandals. At Enron, 4,200 workers were laid off; at 

WorldCom, 17,000.</p>

<P> Cara Alcantar, who accumulated 1,600 stock options in her four years at WorldCom, 

said she was naïve to identify with WorldCom's chief executive. "I felt on the 

same side as Bernie Ebbers, on the cutting edge of technology," she said. "I worked 

extremely hard, and I couldn't imagine layoffs would ever happen to me.'</p>

<P> But on July 3, she was laid off. Now her stock options are worthless, WorldCom 

says it cannot pay her severance benefits, and the half of her retirement savings 

that were in WorldCom stock are virtually worthless. "Not only were they not looking 

out for our interests," Ms. Alcantar said, "they were so greedy they made sure 

the money went into their pockets." </p>

<P> Before, she said, joining a union had never crossed her mind, but now she 

says she wishes WorldCom were unionized. With a union, she says, she might have 

had a defined-benefit pension that, unlike her vaporized 401(k) plan, would have 

guaranteed her benefits even after the stock market plunged. Labor leaders say 

that if Enron or WorldCom were unionized, unions would have won better pensions 

and severance benefits for the workers and, through their prying, might have forced 

the companies to be more honest about their books.</p>

<P> "We're seeing a real waking up across the nation because millions of workers 

are seeing that their economic futures are far less secure than they had been 

led to believe," said Harley Shaiken, a specialist in labor issues at the University 

of California at Berkeley.</p>

<P> A SURVEY released last week by Peter D. Hart Associates found that 66 percent 

of workers said they trusted their employers just some or not much at all. Such 

numbers, labor experts say, suggest that the nation may have reached a watershed 

in which workers conclude that they need collective protections to safeguard them 

from predatory executives and economic downturns.</p>

<P> It is unclear whether a deus ex machina will materialize to rescue the beleaguered 

workers. The most likely candidates are Washington, which seems uninterested, 

and organized labor, which is weak. </p>

<P> Since the Enron scandal, President Bush and Congress have done little to protect 

workers even as they have rushed to protect investors. That is a far cry from 

1963, when the Studebaker automobile company went under and more than 4,000 workers 

lost their pensions. In response, Congress, with a Republican senator, Jacob K. 

Javits, taking the lead, passed legislation that created strict pension protections. 

</p>

<P> The post-Enron Congress has shunned even modest protections like rules to 

require companies to make promised severance payments or to let workers elect 

representatives to the board of their 401(k) plans. </p>

<P> The Hart survey showed that workers are warming to unions, with 50 percent 

of nonunion workers saying they wanted to join a union, the highest level in two 

decades. </p>

<P> It was labor's clout in Congress and collective bargaining that created the 

nation's system of worker protections, including the 40-hour week, pensions, health 

coverage and job safety rules. But unions are weak, representing less than 10 

percent of the private-sector work force, down from 35 percent in the 1950's. 

Unions have been notably unsuccessful in wooing workers from New Economy industries, 

like software.</p>

<P> The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, said he saw a pendulum swing 

in favor of collective protections. "One Enron worker told me, `We trusted our 

employer, and liked our job, but when they threw us on on the street, we lost 

all trust,' " Mr. Sweeney said. "A lot of workers are saying to themselves, `The 

same thing can happen to me.' "</p>
