<p>WASHINGTON — In a city where the talk is of when, not if, there will be war 

with Iraq, a small group of Democratic die-hards in the House is trying to rally 

opposition to military action.</p>

</table>Two dozen or so mainly liberal lawmakers say they view the current moves toward 

war through the prism of their memories of Vietnam. Though they may be viewed 

as outside the mainstream of even their own party, they are raising their voices 

against an invasion, even if their leadership is not.</p>

<P> "I am very skeptical of this whole operation and have the feeling that it 

has much more to do with oil than anything else," said Representative Jim McDermott, 

Democrat of Washington, who added that his experiences as a Navy psychiatrist 

treating Vietnam veterans remained fresh in his mind.</p>

<P> Mr. McDermott and 18 fellow House members stood on the terrace of the Cannon 

House Office Building this week to proclaim their opposition to what they view 

as a potential unprovoked assault on Iraq, without evidence that the nation poses 

a dire threat. At times, the session seemed reminiscent of past antiwar rallies, 

with the speakers warning of young Americans being sent to die on foreign soil 

and urging that the country "give peace a chance." </p>

<P> "Naked aggression is not the American way," said Representative Marcy Kaptur, 

Democrat of Ohio, who sharply criticized the motives of the Bush administration. 

"America, wake up."</p>

<P> This week, these antiwar forces surveyed their Democratic colleagues on the 

House floor on the issue. Some spoke out against the war in a closed meeting of 

the Democratic caucus. They also met privately with Representative Richard A. 

Gephardt, the Democratic leader, to reinforce the idea that there was diverse 

opinion in the party on Iraq. </p>

<P> The lawmakers say they are determined to show that not all members of Congress 

are falling in lock step behind the administration's call for authority to act 

against Iraq.</p>

<P> "We were not sent to Congress to be a rubber stamp," said Representative Barbara 

Lee, who represents traditionally antiwar areas around Berkeley and Oakland in 

Northern California and opposed authorizing use of force against terrorists after 

the Sept. 11 attacks. "The essence of our democracy is debate."</p>

<P> The opponents concede that momentum is not on their side, with Congress moving 

rapidly toward consideration of a resolution that would give the president authority 

to act against Iraq. Other Democrats say this group is a narrow wing of the caucus 

and hardly representative of the party's position on Iraq.</p>

<P> Some of the antiwar Democrats contend they have been marginalized by Mr. Gephardt, 

who has been supportive of President Bush on his call for action against Saddam 

Hussein. One of the Democrats urging caution on Iraq said their leader was letting 

a possible presidential run steer his course.</p>

<P> "I think he is making judgments for his own election campaign as opposed to 

what Democrats ought to be doing as a group here in Congress," said Representative 

Bob Filner, Democrat of California. "He is leading us in the wrong direction."</p>

<P> Aides to Mr. Gephardt said that he was committed to his own view on the issue 

but that he encouraged others to vote their conscience.</p>

<P> "Mr. Gephardt also appealed to the caucus not to question anyone's motives 

whether they are for or against military action," a spokesman, Eric Smith, said.</p>

<P> Though most Democrats in the emerging antiwar coalition are from safe districts, 

opposition to the president on this issue is not without political risks. Mr. 

Filner, for instance, said that fighting a resolution on Iraq could cost him in 

his San Diego district, which is home to many military personnel and retirees.</p>

<P> The Democrats, though, say they are hearing from constituents who want them 

to question the administration and the Congressional leadership on the rationale 

for action against Iraq.</p>

<P> "The people in my district are saying, `Where are the Democrats, where is 

the opposition?' " said Representative Lynn Woolsey, another Northern California 

Democrat who said mail and calls from district residents were running 200 to 1 

against a war with Iraq.</p>

<P> Most of the opponents say the administration's push for action could shatter 

international stability and leave the United States unable to credibly oppose 

first strikes by other nations.</p>

<P> "What moral authority will we have?" asked Representative Bernard Sanders, 

independent of Vermont, who said a pre-emptive attack could set a precedent that 

would lead to "international anarchy."</p>

<P> The Democrats also contend that the cost of the war will detract from priorities 

they say are more important to their communities, including drug coverage for 

older Americans and education.</p>

<P> "This attempt to foment a war is really against the best interests of America, 

it is against the spirit of the country, it is against the economic interests 

of the people," said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio and a 

leader of the opposition. </p>

<P> The opponents often recall how the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which in effect 

authorized the Vietnam war, was passed with little skepticism from Congress.</p>

<P> "I swore to myself that I was never going to be a Tonkin Gulf congressman," 

Mr. Filner said. "I think a lot of us have that going through our minds."</p>

<P> Mr. Kucinich also said he believed that Vietnam was a thread that linked the 

war opponents. He still has a flier from his 1972 campaign for Congress with the 

headline "Kucinich Says End the War."</p>

<P> He said the survey of Democrats found more resistance to a first strike across 

a wider spectrum of lawmakers than he initially expected. There have been quiet 

reservations expressed by Democrats close to the military who are hearing unease 

from the uniformed services. In the Senate, most Democratic criticism has focused 

on the wording of the administration's proposed resolution.</p>

<P> Mr. Kucinich has not given up hope of slowing the move toward possible war.</p>

<P> "The conductor might be yelling `all aboard,' but the train hasn't left the 

station," he said. "This is an attempt to start a serious debate inside the party."</p>
