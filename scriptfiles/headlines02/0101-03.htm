NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD  - India Tuesday offered peace

talks if Pakistan dropped its ``anti-Indian mentality'' but

Islamabad said New Delhi was still massing forces and the

situation remained ``highly explosive.''

<p>Despite fears of war, the nuclear rivals renewed a 1991

pact not to attack each other's nuclear facilities.

</table></font>In a new year message to his nation, Indian Prime Minister

Atal Behari Vajpayee  said he did not want war and would

consider talks on disputed Kashmir  -- at the heart of the

latest tensions -- but only when Pakistan acted against

cross-border terrorism.

<p>Pakistan said British Prime Minister Tony Blair planned a

peacemaking visit to both countries next week, while accusing

India of continuing its military build-up along the border.

<p>India denied the charge, saying its defensive build-up was

''more or less complete.''

<p>``It is still highly explosive and dangerous,'' said an army

official in Pakistani-held Kashmir's capital, Muzaffarabad.

<p>``Any small incident could lead to the situation becoming

out of control.''

<p>FEARS OF WAR

<p>Both sides say they want to avoid war but launched their

biggest troop build-up in almost 15 years, scaled back

diplomatic ties and cut transport links after India blamed

Pakistan-based Kashmir separatists for a December 13 attack on

its parliament.

<p>The stand-off has raised fears of a fourth war between the

nuclear rivals, who have already gone to war twice over the

Himalayan region of Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority

state.

<p>In his message, Vajpayee said India did not want another

war.

<p>``I say to them: 'Shed your anti-India mentality and take

effective steps to stop cross-border terrorism, and you will

find India willing to walk more than half the distance to work

closely with Pakistan to resolve, through dialogue, any issue,

including the contentious issue of Jammu and Kashmir,'' he said.

<p>Indian officials said the opposing armies exchanged mortar

and machinegun fire overnight across the cease-fire line in

Kashmir.

<p>Troops are on alert along the neighbors' more than

1,900-mile border almost three weeks after the parliament

attack.

<p>India blames the attack, in which 14 people were killed, on

two of around a dozen Pakistan-based Kashmir separatist groups.

<p>

The first change in temperature came when India opened the

way to talks and welcomed Pakistan's clampdown on the two

groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.

<p>Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf are due in

Nepal this week for a summit of South Asian leaders although a

top Indian official, who did not want to be identified, later

Tuesday ruled out one-on-one talks at that venue.

<p>``There's no chance of talks,'' said the official. ``Even

(foreign minister) Jaswant Singh will not hold talks with

(Pakistani foreign minister) Abdul Sattar.''

<p>The official said leaders of the two countries would,

however, not avoid each other during the Jan. 4-6 summit.

<p>In a sign there was at least some contact between the

sides, India's foreign ministry announced the joint renewal of

the 1991 deal not to target nuclear institutions.

<p>``India and Pakistan today, through diplomatic channels,

simultaneously at New Delhi and Islamabad, exchanged lists of

nuclear installations and facilities,'' the ministry said.

<p>WEST WEIGHS IN

<p>Pakistan has detained a founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Police

also said they had raided offices of Lashkar and

Jaish-e-Mohammad, and detained two dozen people. Pakistan had

earlier detained Jaish leader Maulana Azhar Masood.

<p>President Bush, who had weighed in personally to push for

talks and press Pakistan to wipe out the two groups he has

branded terrorists, called Musharraf's moves ``a good sign.''

<p>``He's cracking down hard and I appreciate his efforts,''

Bush said. ``Terror is terror and the fact that the Pakistani

president is after the terrorists is a good sign.''

<p>Pakistan said Tuesday British Prime Minister Tony Blair

would visit Pakistan and India next week for talks.

<p>However, the new year has not brought an end to the

violence in Kashmir, mainly Hindu India's only Muslim-majority

state.

<p>Five Hindu civilians, including two children, were shot

dead in an attack blamed on Muslim separatists, Indian police

said. Two soldiers were killed in a rare attack in neighboring

Punjab state Tuesday in a raid also blamed on separatists.

<p>Vajpayee sounded a cautionary note, saying the country

could face more attacks in a lengthy war on terrorism.

<p>``One should neither expect a quick and painless victory nor

despair if more terrorist strikes take place.''
