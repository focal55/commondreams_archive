JERUSALEM   - 

Feeling his men were vulnerable and

trigger-happy at their West Bank checkpoint, the Israeli army

reserve officer did the last thing anyone would have expected

of him -- he got up and left in protest.

<p>The officer was on his way to a military jail Monday. But

before starting a 28-day term for abandoning his post near

Jerusalem at the weekend, he blasted his superiors in an Israel

Radio interview.

<p>"We have reached a situation where we shoot out of fear" at

Palestinians, said the officer, using the assumed name of Ilan.

<p>Repeated Palestinian attacks against roadblocks, a hated

symbol of occupation, has troops more jittery than ever at the

risks of manning them as a Palestinian uprising enters its 18th

month. A raid last week killed six soldiers.

<p>Discontent in the army ranks has been expressed in other

ways, including a petition signed by more than 280 reservists

pledging their refusal to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip

on behalf of what they say is a morally corrupting occupation.

<p>Sunday night, Israeli troops fired at the armored car of

Palestinian parliamentary speaker Ahmed Korei as it approached

a West Bank checkpoint.

<p>Israel apologized for the incident, from which Korei

emerged unscathed. The army said the soldiers feared the car

was going to hit them.

<p>"We use these bullets as a kind of shield, a wall, because

we don't have a wall or concrete to protect us ... in the end

the guys become trigger-happy and very jumpy," said Ilan, whose

rank was not given in the radio report.



<p>OFFICER SAYS HE WARNED SUPERIORS

<p>Ilan said he walked away after fruitless talks with

commanders on a lack of proper procedures which leave soldiers

scared for their own safety and make them dangerous to others.

<p>"I am not prepared to go to the parents of one of the

soldiers and tell them -- your son died in such a way without a

block of concrete to protect him."

<p>One of his superiors, Ilya Shifman, told the radio the army

often reviews security and investigates cases of misconduct.

<p>"But it can't be the case that an officer gets up and

leaves the company without telling anyone," Shifman said.

<p>The army also said last week it plans to remove many fixed

checkpoints and carry out surprise inspections along West Bank

roads to provide better security.

<p>Dozens of Israeli military blockades cut through main

arteries throughout the West Bank and Gaza, isolating

Palestinian cities and villages.

<p>Erected since the first Palestinian uprising in the late

1980s, Israel says they provide a barrier against gunmen and

suicide bombers. But Palestinians say the economically

crippling blockades mainly punish ordinary civilians.

<p>Palestinians frequently complain of abuse or outright

violence by soldiers at the roadblocks. Some troops admit to

buckling under the daily pressure of confronting potential

assailants in a sea of civilians.

<p>Monday, Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian man who

tried to circumvent a roadblock as he drove his pregnant wife

to hospital to give birth. The woman was wounded in the

shoulder.

<p>In a separate incident, troops killed a 15-year-old girl

who they said ran at their roadblock waving a knife.

<p>She left a suicide note, family members said.

<p>"I have decided by God's will to (attack) those arrogants

at the damned checkpoint and kill them to teach them a lesson

that they have no security on our land," it said.</p>
