            <p>The US has plans to establish an American-led military administration 

              in Iraq, similar to the postwar occupation of Germany and Japan, 

              which could last for several years after the fall of Saddam Hussein, 

              it emerged yesterday. 

            <P>The plans, which surfaced after President George Bush won a resounding 

              congressional mandate to use force in Iraq, envisage the biggest 

              "nation-building" effort the US has undertaken since the end of 

              the second world war. 

            <P>The occupation of the country would need an estimated 75,000 troops, 

              at an annual cost of up to $16bn (&#163;10bn), and would almost 

              certainly include British and other allied soldiers. It would be 

              run by a senior American officer, perhaps General Tommy Franks, 

              who would lead the assault on Iraq, and whose role would be modeled 

              on that of General Douglas MacArthur in postwar Japan. 

            <P>The occupation regime would track down war criminals and remove 

              members of President Saddam's Ba'ath party from power, comb the 

              country for any hidden biological and chemical weapons, and guarantee 

              Iraq's territorial integrity. It would also administer the country's 

              huge oil deposits. 

            <P>Ahmad Chalabi, leader of the opposition Iraqi National Congress 

              who is visiting Washington this week, gave the plan a qualified 

              welcome yesterday. He said he would prefer an interim Iraqi government 

              to be established in the immediate aftermath of President Saddam's 

              fall, but would accept a foreign administration as a temporary precursor 

              to a true democracy. 

            <P>"We are concerned first with the liberation of Iraq," he told the 

              Guardian, adding that he had "no idea" how long such a transitional 

              period would last. He said it was "very, very clear it is going 

              to be a huge development in the Arab world". 

            <P>Mr Chalabi denied that such a large-scale prolonged US military 

              presence would destabilize the region, but an Arab diplomat in Washington 

              said it could have an "explosive" impact in the Middle East, where 

              the US military presence has already proven a rallying cry for militants 

              including Osama bin Laden. 

            <P>"Every day in Iraq would raise the cost," the diplomat warned. 

            <P>The Iraqi project, outlined by Mr Bush's senior adviser on the 

              Middle East, Zalmay Khalilzad, would involve running the entire 

              country until a democratic Iraqi government was deemed ready. 

            <P>A British official stressed yesterday that although contingency 

              plans were undoubtedly being drawn up, London had not agreed to 

              such a strategy. "It seems this is coming from the right end of 

              the &#91;political&#93; spectrum. I don't know if this is mainstream 

              thinking in the administration," the official said. 

            <P>US officials said no final decision had been taken on the plan, 

              but indicated that some form of direct American military rule was 

              almost inevitable. 

            <P>"The purpose of the military has not changed: to fight and win 

              wars," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman said. "But at the 

              end of the day, when the military conflict has come to an end, the 

              question then becomes - in the post-Saddam era - how to make certain 

              the country remains unified, is stabilized, the region has stability. 

              The United States will not cut and run from that mission." 

            <P>Mr Khalilzad provided a sketch of the plan at a meeting of diplomats 

              and Middle East experts at the weekend. "We will not enter Iraq 

              as conquerors. We will not treat the Iraqi people as a defeated 

              nation," he insisted. He said the long-term US aim was to establish 

              a "representative and democratic" government. 

            <P>"In the short term, however, we will reunify Iraq, because at present 

              Iraq is not united, and maintain its territorial integrity," he 

              said. 

            <P>"First, there will be the political reconstruction. This will involve 

              thorough reform of the government, de-Ba'athising Iraq, removing 

              elements used by Saddam to enforce his tyranny. Officials guilty 

              of crimes against humanity will be prosecuted." 

            <P>He conceded that "the costs will be significant", but added: "We 

              would have the commitment of resources necessary, and we would have 

              the will to stay for as long as necessary to do the job." 

            <P>A military thinktank called the Role of American Military Power, 

              has estimated that 75,000 troops would be necessary to stabilize 

              Iraq after any war. It is possible that funds would be stripped 

              from US contributions to international efforts to stabilize other 

              regions such as the Balkans, to help meet the costs.
