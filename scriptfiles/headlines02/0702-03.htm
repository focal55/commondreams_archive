<p>WASHINGTON — The process used to sterilize Congressional mail after the anthrax 

attacks last fall could itself be making Capitol Hill workers sick, a report to 

be issued on Tuesday says.</p>

<P> The Office of Compliance, which is responsible for Congressional workplace 

safety, said its inquiry into more than 200 complaints "concluded that handling 

irradiated mail for substantial periods" might cause or contribute to health problems 

reported by Congressional employees.</p>

<P> The findings are the first to suggest that irradiation could be harmful. The 

report called for monitoring workers, further studies on long-term exposure to 

irradiated mail and some protective steps, including airing the mail before delivering 

it.</p>

<P> An earlier review for Congressional administrative officials found no evidence 

that handling irradiated mail affected health. The Postal Service has also said 

that testing showed the mail is not harmful.</p>

<P> Kristin Krathwohl, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service, said the agency would 

"certainly read the report of the general counsel of the Office of Compliance 

with great care." The Postal Service, Ms. Krathwohl added, was guided by assurances 

from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes 

of Occupational Safety and Health that irradiation was safe. "We rely on them," 

she said.</p>

<P> Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who sought the investigation 

in February, said the report suggested that the earlier Congressional inquiry 

"may have been too quick to conclude irradiated mail was harmless, and they may 

not have taken employees' health concerns seriously enough."</p>

<P> "Irradiating the mail," Mr. Grassley added, "was and is a big experiment."</p>

<P> Hundreds of thousands of pieces of mail to Congress and federal agencies in 

Washington are sent each day to a radiation center in New Jersey for treatment 

before being distributed. Wider use of irradiation has been considered. The process, 

more often used on food and medical equipment, exposes mail to an electron beam 

that renders any anthrax harmless.</p>

<P> The irradiation of Washington mail began last November after letters containing 

anthrax spores were sent to Capitol Hill, causing the Hart Senate Office Building 

to be closed for months. Anthrax-laced mail in Washington and elsewhere killed 

five people. The Postal Service resumed delivering mail to Congressional offices 

in January.</p>

<P> Dozens of House and Senate employees soon complained of ailments that included 

headaches, nausea, bloody noses, rashes and other irritations. Postal workers 

also reported problems. The compliance office said that in May it resurveyed Congressional 

employees who had filed health complaints and found that 55 percent of those contacted 

continued to report problems, though they were often milder.</p>

<P> "The continued symptoms in employees is the single most important reason in 

suggesting the need for more study," said Gary Green, general counsel of the office.</p>

<P> The report, Mr. Green said, was compiled with the help of two specialists 

in occupational medicine and two industrial hygienists. Independent environmental 

testing by the investigators was also critical to the findings, he said.</p>

<P> The report said tests of the air from irradiated mailbags and the House and 

Senate mail rooms detected small amounts of chemical irritants that could have 

been produced from the paper during irradiation.</p>

<P> "While we do not believe these chemical irritants are life-threatening," the 

report said, "we believe further study is essential to determine the effects of 

extended exposure to irradiated mail, particularly in restricted work areas."</p>

<P> Earlier this year, the Postal Service said the irradiation could produce carbon 

monoxide, and it began holding the mail in a ventilating area for 24 hours to 

let any gas dissipate. But officials said tests showed no threat to health.</p>

<P> The study for a Congressional task force by the National Institutes of Occupational 

Safety and Health attributed the staff complaints to "multiple factors" including 

odors that could trigger reactions and "heightened awareness and resultant employee 

stress from recent terrorist attacks."</p>
