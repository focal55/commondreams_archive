Public health groups and AIDS activists say African governments are likely to cut back their proposals for combating HIV-AIDS due to the lack of money provided by donors to a new international fund whose operations are only just getting underway.

<p>

As the governing board of the <a href="http://www.globalfundatm.org/" target="_new">Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria</a> meets this week at United Nations  headquarters in New York to announce its first grants, demand for the money is running far ahead of supply, the groups said.

<p>







According to the <a href="http://www.healthgap.org/" target="_new">Health GAP Coalition</a>, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization (NGO), governments that are submitting funding proposals to the board are expected to ask for almost US&#36;3 billion in financing for the first year of the Fund's operation, although less than one third of that amount will be available by year-end 2002.

<p>

</table></font>Donor governments have so far pledged &#36;1.9 billion dollars over the next three years, of which only &#36;750 million will be disbursed before the end of this year, according to the UN. Only &#36;200 million will be awarded at this week's board meeting.

<p>







"There were lots of rumors flying round saying: 'if your proposal is too big, forget about it,'" the head of the national AIDS Commission in Malawi, Biziwick Mawale, told the <i>Financial Times</i> earlier this week. The chairman of the Fund's Technical Review Panel, Michel Kazatchkine, noted this week that developing countries were "shy" about submitting substantial proposals, especially for treatment of AIDS patients.

<p>







Activists fault major donor governments for failing to raise the minimum annual amount, &#36;7-10 billion, that the Fund deems necessary to contain the spread of AIDS, which by itself kills some 8,000 people, including about 6,000 Africans, every day.

<p>







Although President George W. Bush has promised to increase U.S. contributions as the Fund proves itself, Washington, the largest donor, has earmarked only &#36;500 million for the Fund to date, of which &#36;300 million should be available by the end of this week, according to Tommy Thompson, of Health and Human Services, who addressed the board Tuesday.

<p>







On a per capita basis, European countries are pledging at about twice as much but still fall far below what is required to meet the Fund's minimum requirements, according to NGOs and health experts.

<p>







Even fellow-Republicans in the U.S. Congress have assailed Bush's contributions to date as inadequate. Right-wing Senator Jesse Helms has introduced legislation that would add &#36;500 million to the U.S. contribution this year, and AIDS lobbyists are hoping that amount might rise to at least &#36;700 million by the time it is taken up in committee early next month.

<p>









But even if this amount is forthcoming, the Fund will still fall drastically short of its minimum target, according to activists, some of whom are now calling the system of voluntary pledges a failure.

<p>







Dr. Tim France of the U.S.-based <a href="http://www.hdnet.org/">Health & Development Networks</a>, Gorik Ooms of <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/" target="_new">Doctors Without Borders</a>  (Medecins Sans Frontieres), and Bernard Rivers of Aidspan have called on the 48 wealthiest countries to provide 0.035 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) as part of a burden-sharing framework to raise a total of &#36;9 billion each year, with the balance provided by voluntary contributions from private corporations and foundations.

<p>







At that rate, the U.S. would be the largest donor by far at some &#36;3.5 billion a year, followed by Japan at &#36;1.65 billion, and Germany at &#36;658 million, according to the scheme's supporters.
