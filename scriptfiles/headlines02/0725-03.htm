<p>LONDON - British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday an attack on Iraq 

was not imminent.

<p>"We are all getting a bit ahead of ourselves," Blair told  reporters in his Downing Street office.<p>"It is not imminent, we are not at the point of decision  yet. There are many issues to be considered before we are at  the point of decision."<p>Blair refused to commit to giving parliament a vote ahead  of any military action aimed at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.<p>Many members of his own party oppose an onslaught against  Baghdad and are demanding a say in parliament.<p>Blair has stood staunchly beside President Bush since the  September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, making it  difficult to decouple from the United States if it did target  Saddam.<p>The United States has accused Iraq of being part of an axis  of evil, allegedly supporting terrorism and seeking to acquire  weapons of mass destruction. International weapons inspectors  left Iraq in December 1998 and have not returned.<p>"Saddam is in breach of all the United Nations  resolutions," Blair said. "Weapons of mass destruction are an  issue. Iraq's position in relation to weapons of mass  destruction is an issue but we have taken no decisions as to  how to deal with it."<p>At his last appearance in parliament Wednesday, before a  three-month summer break, Blair was pressed by three of his own  Labor Party members over Iraq.<p>They demanded a fresh U.N. resolution and the chance for  British politicians to have a say before any troops were  committed to an attack.

<p>He faced a similar onslaught at a closed-door meeting with Labor members of 

parliament. "We just got the same old stone-walling," one said.</span>
