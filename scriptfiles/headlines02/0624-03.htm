<p> SEVILLE, Spain - Activists who gathered this weekend in this southern Spanish 

city in a ''counter-summit'' to a meeting of European Union (EU) leaders culminated 

their seminars, debates and protests with a peaceful march through the city. 

<p>

The Social Forum of Seville met parallel to a meeting of the European Council, 

which brought together the heads of state and government of the 15 EU countries 

and the president of the bloc's executive arm, the European Commission. The leaders 

agreed on measures to curb illegal immigration.

</table></font>Around 100 separate protest demonstrations ended Saturday night with a peaceful march through the city by more than 150,000 people, according to the organizers, or 20,000 according to official estimates.

<p>







Red flags, placards and chants against ''a Europe of capital'' abounded in the march, which took place amidst a festive atmosphere and a heavy police guard.

<p>







The only violent incidents that marred the EU summit were car bombs set off by the Basque separatist group ETA, which injured several people.

<p>







The Social Forum discussed a range of economic, social and cultural problems that the activists saw as inextricably linked to the ''neo-liberal'' globalization model.

<p>







The manifesto of the Social Forum called for total cancellation of the external debt of poor countries, an economy at the service of citizens, ''genuine'' social policies, and a Europe more committed to the environment.

<p>







Consulta Europea, one of the participating groups, described EU policy as ''a religion of the market.''

<p>







The European bloc does not seem to be aware that in its territory ''there are three million homeless citizens, or even that there are poor,'' including ''25 percent of the adult population of Portugal, nearly 20 percent of that of Britain, and over 15 percent of that of Spain,'' the group added.

<p>







One of the seminars organized by the Social Forum was held at the Pablo Olavide University of Seville, where hundreds of mainly African immigrant farm workers are staging a sit-in, demanding work and residency permits.

<p>







Members of the international environmental watchdog Greenpeace and the Seville-based Fundaci&#243;n Primero de Mayo took part in a debate on sustainable development at the university.

<p>







One of the conclusions of the debate was that the ''ecological debt'' owed by industrialized countries to Third World nations far surpasses the financial debt of developing countries.

<p>







When the call for the march was issued 10 days ago, the government refused to authorize the route scheduled by the organizers, and instead ordered the protesters to follow the Guadalquivir river that borders the city.

<p>







But the Social Forum argued that the route assigned by the government ran through a dangerous area, and that only the fish in the river would see the demonstrators.

<p>







The activists turned to the Supreme Court of Andalusia, the autonomous community in which Seville is located, with no luck. After the organizers decided to hold the march anyway, the government delegates said they would negotiate, and a route was finally agreed.

<p>







Although a majority of the participants in the Social Forum were from Andalusia and the rest of Spain, some activists also came from other European countries.

<p>







Around 10,000 people camped out in the Parque del Alamillo, while an undetermined number stayed in private homes ''to avoid provocations, by small organizations or the police,'' one of the organizers told IPS.

<p>







The organizers warned those who camped out in the park that it was an important ecological center that was home to thousands of birds. They said no one should bathe in the river, which could harm the populations of ducks and fish.

<p>







Carried at the head of the march were two banners, reading ''Against a Europe of Capital and War'' and ''No Person is Illegal'', alluding to the EU agreement that will make it easier to deport undocumented immigrants.

<p>







Local residents, watching from their balconies, applauded the demonstrators and doused them with buckets of cold water to refresh them in the 40-degree heat.

<p> At the end of the demonstration, the marchers headed towards the Torre de 

Triana to attend a concert by local bands that back the causes championed by the 

Social Forum, including Tantatrampa, El Puchero del Hortelano, Reincidentes, Boikot, 

Eskorzo and Banda Hach&#237;s.
