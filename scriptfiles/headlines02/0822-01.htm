<p>JOHANNESBURG - </b> Civil society and environmental and community development 

activists remain divided about how best to alleviate world poverty and protect 

the environment, as they head into the <a href="http://www.worldsummit.org.za/" target="_new">Global 

Forum</a> of the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD). 

<p> The <a href="http://www.worldsummit.org.za/" target="_new">Global Forum</a> 

is an opportunity for non-governmental and civil society organizations from around 

the world to meet and sketch their vision of how global poverty can be erased 

while still protecting the environment and natural resources of the world. 

<p>

With about 40,000 delegates - optimistically - expected to attend the gathering, it will be the largest of the WSSD meetings. The forum runs from Aug 19 to Sep 4 in the South African city, Johannesburg.

</table></font>The Global Forum is meant to submit a declaration to the heads of state meeting of the WSSD, for them to consider when they draw-up the official political statement and plan of action for the UN summit. 

<p> &#8221;It is early days and very difficult to see if we will be able to reach 

agreement,&#8221; says Victor Munnik, a policy analyst with the Civil Society 

Secretariat, which is charged with organizing the forum. &#8221;The immediate 

challenge is to overcome the physical fragmentation between delegates, and then 

see what of their differences are tactical - and can be overcome - and which are 

principled.&#8221; 

<p> Because of political differences and practical difficulties, different organizations 

have set-up camp in different places. Right next to the venue for the UN-endorsed 

Global Forum, the Social Movements Indaba has set up its own meeting place. 

<p> The Social Movements Indaba is a grouping of organizations that do not want 

anything to do with the official UN process as they believe it is dominated and 

controlled by governments and big business and will not be able to come up with 

solutions to the challenge of sustainable development. They are planning their 

own meetings and protests. 

<p>

A bit further down the road, the South African-based Landless People's Movement (LPM) has set-up camp for those who want to focus on a single issue - the right of ordinary people to have access to land. They are trying to keep both the Global Forum and the Social Movements Indaba at an arm's length to prevent them taking the focus off the land campaign. 

<p> Sounding slightly bemused, Munnik appealed for &#8221;diversity in solidarity, 

and solidarity in diversity&#8221; and for organizations to compromise &#8221;as 

much as they can live with&#8221; so that the Global Forum could come up with 

a united, broadly supported political declaration. 

<p> Munnik sees some chance of the diverse collection of non-governmental, environmental 

and community development organizations, attending the summit, reaching an agreement. 

He points out the environmental organizations as politically diverse as Greenpeace, 

the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Justice Network to be overcoming 

some of their differences ahead of the Global Forum. 

<p>

&#8221;They are working together in a way that I have not seen before,&#8221; he comments. 

<p>

Important groupings like youth, women and indigenous peoples have been meeting ahead of the Global Forum, to come up with positions that will reflect their common interests and concerns. These will be tabled at the forum for inclusion in its political declaration. 

<p>

The big issue, facing civil society at the Global Forum, is deciding if they can work with global political and financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Then they have to find ways of defending existing agreements on the protection of the global environment and the alleviation of world poverty; and pushing for increases in international development aid and environmental protection standards, say some activists. 

<p> There are also divisions between those organizations who want the forum to 

rally to the cause of protecting natural resources, while others believe that 

the only way to protect the environment is to prioritize the social and economic 

development of communities. 

<p> Community and environmental activists also point out that even if civil society 

manages to hammer out a broadly acceptable political declaration, it is likely 

that it will demand more in terms of development and environmental protection 

programs than governments attending the WSSD are going to be ready to concede. 

<p>

Despite the divisions and the difficulties, World Conservation Union (IUCN) South African representative, Saliem Fakir, says the Global Forum and other events being held around the WSSD will give activists a chance to debate issues in a way, which the diplomatic protocols of the official meetings will not allow. 

<p>

That alone makes the gathering vital to coming-up with solutions to the challenges of sustainable development, he observes.
