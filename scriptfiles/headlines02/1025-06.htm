<p>BAGHDAD  - Iraq said on Friday a U.S. draft  resolution at the United Nations to disarm Baghdad would turn  U.N. weapons inspections into spying for any U.S. war plans.<p>The U.S. draft was submitted to the 15-member U.N. Security  Council on Wednesday and could be voted on as early as next  week.<p>U.N. weapons inspectors, sent to Iraq after the 1991 Gulf  War, left in 1998. Washington has been seeking a tough new U.N.  resolution to strengthen the inspectors' powers in hunting for  chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction.<p>The official al-Thawra daily newspaper said in a front-page  editorial: "The text of this draft turns inspections into  piracy and weapons inspectors into armed Mafia gangs and spying  tools."<p>"All this violates the sovereignty of Iraq, its dignity and  rights and undermines its national security," it added.<p>The Security Council is expected to debate the U.S. draft  resolution for the first time on Friday.<p>Russia and France have voiced reservations about the U.S.  draft, saying its language could trigger military action before  the inspectors report on any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.<p>The U.S. draft, co-sponsored by Britain, gives inspectors  far-reaching rights and privileges to hunt for signs of an  Iraqi program to make weapons of mass destruction.<p>The U.S. resolution would declare Iraq in "material breach"  of past U.N. resolutions and warn Iraq of "serious  consequences" if it thwarts new U.N. weapons inspections --  language Russia and France fear could prompt military action.<p>Al-Thawra urged the Security Council to stop any resolution  that would allow Washington to carry out its "evil intentions"  against Iraq.<p>"The texts of this proposal are not only unrealistic and  unfulfillable, but are designed to create a pretext to attack  Iraq under a fake international cover," it said.<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri on Thursday likened the  U.S. draft to a declaration of war.<p>In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Sabri  said he did not understand why a resolution was needed and he  asked why the arms inspectors had not come to Baghdad to begin  work.<p>The letter, made available to Reuters in Baghdad, said Iraq  had worked in good faith with the United Nations and agreed to  allow the return of weapons inspectors without any conditions.<p>"Despite the agreement, the inspectors did not arrive on  the agreed date and Iraq was not informed about the delay or  the reasons for the delay or about the new proposed date for  their arrival," it said.<p>"The United States does not want the inspectors to return  because they will expose its lies and allegations against  Iraq," the letter added.</p>
