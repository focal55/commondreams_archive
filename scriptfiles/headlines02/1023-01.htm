<p>It has been revealed the United States' draft UN resolution on Iraq imposes 

a 75-day deadline for weapons inspectors to begin the disarmament of Saddam Hussein's 

regime.

<p>The US has already changed the wording of the motion to remove the automatic 

trigger for military action if Saddam Hussein is uncooperative. 

<p>The wording of the document, which became public for the first time today, 

gives Iraq 30 days to make a full and complete declaration of its weapons of mass 

destruction. 

<p>It then gives weapons inspectors another 45 days to start work on disarmament. 

<p>If those deadlines are not met, the US will consider military action. 

<p>But Russia and France say they still do not believe the resolution is satisfactory, 

because it is not very different to previous drafts. 

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov says Russia will only accept a resolution 

that does not allow the automatic use of force. 

<p>Earlier, after talks with chief UN arms inspector Hans Blix, Mr Ivanov said 

the weapons inspectors must resume their work in Iraq rapidly.

<p>Dr Blix appeared optimistic after talks with Mr Ivanov, saying he was able 

to spell out the importance of a united position in the UN Security Council on 

a resolution for getting his inspectors back into Iraq. 

<p>When quizzed about Russia's negative reaction to the new resolution from the 

US, Dr Blix agreed there was still some distance between council members. 

<p>However he believes a consensus will take days not weeks, pointing out the 

permanent members of the Security Council had already made significant progess 

on difficult issues. 

<p>He says his team is ready to go and once a resolution has been passed and agreed 

to by Iraq, he will have an advance crew in Bagdad within seven to 10 days.</p>
