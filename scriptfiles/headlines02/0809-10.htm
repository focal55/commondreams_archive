<p>AMERICA will attack Iraq on November 6, US defense experts believe.</p>

<p>They are so sure of the date that they have posted an <a href="http://www.GlobalSecurity.org" target="_new">Iraq 

Countdown clock</a> on the internet to show the minutes ticking away.</p>

<p>Five of the US Navy's aircraft carriers will be close to the Gulf region. Weather 

and political factors also favor the date picked by international think tank <a href="http://www.GlobalSecurity.org" target="_new">GlobalSecurity.org</a> 

for the start of the campaign to topple Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>Respected commentator John Pike, director of the Washington-based organization, 

told the Daily Mirror: "Iraq is going to happen a lot sooner than most people 

think."</p>

<p>The eight key pointers are:</p>

<p> 

<ul>

<li>President Bush must have resolved the Iraq situation when his re-election 

campaign begins in under 18 months, and a war and clean-up will take at least 

a year;<br>

</li>

<li>Delaying an attack will give Saddam more time to prepare his defenses;<br>

</li>

<li>A war in the desert would be almost impossible before October because it is 

too hot for troops to wear protective bio-chemical suits;<br>

</li>

<li>In December and January, temperatures are low enough to freeze diesel oil, 

cloud hinders air visibility, and desert snow can hamper tanks;<br>

</li>

<li>Elections to the US Congress finish on November 5. President Bush cannot fight 

a war in the month-long run-up;<br>

</li>

<li>Media speculation and government leaks had all predicted an invasion in February 

or March 2003, so early November might have given the US an element of surprise;<br>

</li>

<li>The military will have time to replenish stocks of smart bombs that were depleted 

by the Afghanistan campaign;<br>

</li>

<li>Five US aircraft carriers will be close by, together with Royal Navy carrier 

Ark Royal, providing an invasion base under the cover of routine deployment.<br>

</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>Aircraft carriers are expected to play a key role in any assault on Iraq.</p>

<p>Several allies, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, that gave facilities in 

the 1991 Gulf War have ruled out the same support for America's drive to oust 

the Iraqi dictator. </p>

<p>Each American carrier will have a full complement of F18 Hornet fighter-bombers 

and a strike force of up to 1,000 Marines. All five will be battle ready and within 

five days sailing from the region on maneuvers by the beginning of November.</p>

<p>Ark Royal's war games mission in the Mediterranean, announced this week, is 

due to finish on November 5.</p>

<p>Mr Pike said: "The opportunity to attack without having to announce new deployments 

to the world beforehand is likely to be far too good for Pentagon war-planners 

to ignore.</p>

<p>"You can go to war within three weeks of making a decision about it, and within 

one week of the world finding out.</p>

<p>"The President is under a lot of political pressure for results and his window 

is pretty tight.</p>

<p>"If I was a betting man, November 6 is where all my money would be."</p>
