<p>A new round of tests showing high levels of a suspected carcinogen in french 

fries and other starchy snack foods is throwing a scare into the food industry. 

<P>Fearing panic among consumers and slumping sales as a result, industry officials 

are conducting their own tests and putting out statements intended to calm fears 

that acrylamide, a substance that causes cancer in animals, might pose a human 

health risk in food. 

<P>The latest tests, conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest 

and disclosed Tuesday, echo the findings of a Swedish government study in April 

that showed high levels of acrylamides -- a substance used to make plastics and 

purify water -- in french fries, potato chips and other starchy food cooked at 

high temperatures. 

<P>The World Health Organization is holding a special meeting of scientists this 

week at its headquarters in Geneva to discuss the results of research done in 

Sweden, Norway and Britain, and set priorities for further research. It is expected 

to make recommendations to food agencies and consumers on Thursday. 

<P>Representatives of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are attending the 

meeting, and FDA officials said they had begun testing for acrylamide in food 

from "a variety of products and sources." 

<P>However, the agency said, it is not cautioning consumers to steer clear of 

any particular products. Instead, until further recommendations are made by the 

World Health Organization, the FDA is urging consumers to eat foods from a "wide 

variety of sources." 

<P>The findings of the Swedish government study in April took the industry by 

surprise. 

<P>Since then, food companies have begun doing their own testing. Many have also 

found the chemical, although they have not found it in levels as high as those 

pinpointed overseas, said Gene Grabowski of the Grocery Manufacturers of America. 

<P>Acrylamide appears to be formed by a chemical reaction during cooking. The 

highest levels of acrylamide have been found in starchy foods cooked at high temperature, 

such as french fries and potato chips. 

<P>The Center for Science in the Public Interest has already begun using the research 

to further its nutrition mission. It's urging consumers to cut back on starchy 

snack foods. 

<P>"There has long been reason for Americans to eat less greasy french fries and 

snack chips," says Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director. "Acrylamide 

is yet another reason."</p>
