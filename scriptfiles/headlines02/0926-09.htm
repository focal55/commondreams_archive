<p> NEW YORK &#150;&#150;  Christopher Hitchens, longtime conservative columnist for The Nation, is leaving the liberal weekly publication.<P>Hitchens writes in the Oct. 14 issue that it would be "false to continue the association" with the magazine.<P>Hitchens, who has written his "Minority Report" column for 20 years, favored the impeachment of former President Clinton and has been a supporter of the war on terror and a military action against Iraq. Those positions differ from those of the nation's editorial leadership, including publisher Victor Navasky.<P>"When I began work for The Nation over two decades ago, Victor Navasky described the magazine as a debating ground between liberals and radicals, which was, I thought, well judged," Hitchens writes.<P>"In the past few weeks, though, I have come to realize that the magazine itself takes a side in this argument, and is becoming the voice and the echo chamber of those who truly believe that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden."<P>In the same issue, the magazine includes a statement addressing Hitchens' departure.<P>"We have been publishing Christopher for more than twenty years, and the relationship with him has been a rewarding one for this magazine and for our readers," the statement said. "That is testimony to the fact that Christopher has always been completely free to express his views, and differences he has had with the editors he has honorably ventilated. We will miss his eloquent and passionate voice and his elegantly crafted prose."<P>Hitchens also contributes to Granta, The London Review of Books, Harper's and The Atlantic Monthly, among other publications.<P>He is the author of several books, including "The Trial of Henry Kissinger."
