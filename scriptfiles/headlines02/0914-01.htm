<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq - <font face=arial,helvetica size=-1> It would be immoral for 

America to attack Iraq without provocation, a former U.S. senator said here Saturday.</font>

<p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">J</font>ames Abourezk, who used to represent 

South Dakota in the senate, was speaking to reporters after he, Democratic West 

Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall and two other Americans met with Iraqi Health Minister 

Omed Medhat Mubarak. 

<p> The four-person delegation arrived overnight in Iraq, saying it intended to 

push for peace as well as the return of U.N. weapons inspectors. 

<p> It is the first time in several years that a sitting U.S. legislator has visited 

Iraq, which has been under U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in 1990. 

<p> "We are on a humanitarian mission ... not only to convince the Iraqi people 

that the American people are concerned with their suffering, but also to show 

that the American people, their vast majority, are peace-waging individuals," 

Rahall told reporters after flying in from Syria.

Nick Rahall (D-WV), the head of an unofficial U.S. delegation (L), meets with 

Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in his office in Baghdad, September 14, 

2002. A delegation headed by a U.S. Congressman said on Saturday they would ask 

the Iraqi government to allow the unconditional return of weapons inspectors to

</table></font></font>President Bush told the U.N. General Assembly this week that the Iraqi government 

must grant access to U.N. weapons inspectors or face confrontation. Ratcheting 

up the pressure Friday, Bush said he was "talking days and weeks" for a proposed 

U.N. Security Council resolution that would demand Iraq admit inspectors or face 

the consequences. 

<p> Iraq has barred inspectors, who are charged with verifying the elimination 

of its weapons of mass destruction, since 1998. 

<p> After the meeting with the health minister, Abourezk criticized moves toward 

an attack on Iraq and said the United States was motivated by Israel. 

<p> "If America launched an attack on somebody without any provocation and declaration 

of war, then it will lose its moral standards," Abourezk said. 

<p> "Bush, pushed by Israel, is trying to build a case against Iraq without evidence," 

he said. 

<p> Israel has accused Iraq of sponsoring terror by financing the families of 

Palestinian suicide bombers and trying to smuggle weapons into the Palestinian 

areas. 

<p> Before the meeting with the health minister, Rahall said that if he were to 

meet Iraqi officials, "it is my desire to stress upon the Iraqi government and 

its president that they must accept unconditional access to their country by U.N. 

weapons inspectors." 

<p> Rahall said the return of inspectors would be a step toward peace, but he 

declined to say if it would put an end to Bush's desire to oust Iraqi President 

Saddam Hussein. 

<p> "I cannot speak on behalf of President Bush. I am not here as a secretary 

of state or a weapons inspector. I am here as individual member of congress who 

has questions that I would like to get answers to," Rahall said. 

<p> The delegation visited al-Mansour Children's Hospital in Baghdad, where Rahall 

met leukemia patients and gave toys to the children. 

<p> The delegation's trip is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.accuracy.org" target="_new">Institute 

for Public Accuracy</a>, a Washington-based group of analysts. 

<p> The other delegates are Norman Solomon, the institute's executive director, 

and James Jennings, the president of Conscience International &#151; an Atlanta-based 

aid and rights group.
