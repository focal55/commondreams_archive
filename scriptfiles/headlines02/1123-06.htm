Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said on November 22, 2002 he had rejected 

an offer by his Director of Communications Francoise Ducros to resign after she 

was quoted as calling U.S. President George W. Bush a moron. Chretien (L) and

</font>The dictionary says moron is derived from the Greek word <i>moros,</i> 

which means foolish or stupid. A moron is someone who has the "mental age of between 

8 and 12 ... a very stupid person." 

<P></P>

But the experts on stupidity (or so they claim) suggest Françoise Ducros may be 

correct in her assessment of U.S. President George W. Bush. 

<P></P>

"Technically, a moron is someone who is stupid but looks normal," said Albert 

Nerenberg, a Toronto-based film director who is completing a television documentary 

titled <i>Stupidity</i>. 

<P></P>

"Much has been said recently about Bush arriving at a point where he looks presidential," 

said Nerenberg. "What's intriguing about morons is that they can pass as just 

about anyone, but inside they're still morons." 

<P></P>

The term "moron" was added to the U.S. version of the IQ test to screen out people 

who looked intelligent but weren't. 

<P></P>

A moron was considered to have an IQ between 50 and 75. 

<P></P>

Certainly Bush is no Dan Quayle. The former vice-president was known for numerous 

intellectual gaffes, including a remark he made while in Latin America about wishing 

he could "speak Latin'' so he could communicate with people in the country he 

was visiting. 

<P></P>

But Bush hasn't escaped ridicule about his alleged intellectual shortcomings. 

Even before he was sworn in as president, late-night comedians in the U.S. regularly 

dined out on jokes about his intelligence. 

<P></P>

Still, some U.S. commentators, especially of the right-wing persuasion, are blowing 

a fuse over the PM aide's remark. 

<P></P>

It's all proof that Canadians are "the spoiled brats of the new world order," 

fumed Pat Buchanan, failed presidential candidate and regular Canada-basher.</p>
