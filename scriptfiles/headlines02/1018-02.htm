<p>Democrats battling for political survival in races that may decide the balance 

of power in Congress are getting a big boost from the anti-war effort.</p>

<p>MoveOnPAC.org, an Internet site, has raised more than $1 million in 48 hours 

for what it calls four "heroes" of Congress who opposed the Iraq resolution.</p>

<p>Sen. Paul D. Wellstone of Minnesota, Reps. Rick Larsen and Jay Inslee of Washington, 

and Rep. Rush D. Holt of New Jersey are being rewarded as "heroes of the anti-war 

effort" with money to fight their opponents in these last two weeks before the 

election, said Peter Schurman, executive director of <a href="http://www.moveon.org/" target="_new">MoveOn.org</a>, 

and a spokesman for the MoveOnPAC.</p>

<p>Since raising more than $1 million from 25,000 donors, the political action 

committee has added Bill Bradbury, running for Senate in Oregon, and Rep. James 

H. Maloney of Connecticut to its efforts. MoveOnPAC.org also plans to give the 

candidates practical help in the form of volunteers, Schurman said.</p>

<p>"Over the next two weeks we'll be providing a variety of opportunities to win 

key races -- by volunteering, by voting, by raising money, by talking to friends 

-- all a variety of important steps people can take," Schurman said. "These elections 

are about participation and we're going to win by participating."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moveon.org/" target="_new">MoveOn.org</a> was begun by 

two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Wes Boyd and Joan Blades, to lobby against the 

impeachment of President Bill Clinton. (Its name comes from its original message: 

"Censure and move on.") MoveOnPAC.org, a separate legal entity run by many of 

the same people as <a href="http://www.moveon.org/" target="_new">MoveOn.org</a>, 

"enables people to make an impact on Congress by pooling their money to make a 

decisive impact where it can make the most difference," Schurman said.</p>

<p>Contributions made to the candidates online go directly and instantly to the 

candidate's campaign.</P> <p></p>
