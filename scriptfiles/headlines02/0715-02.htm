<p>Iraqi exiles expected to participate in a future government of their country 

warned yesterday that an invasion by American and British troops would bring widespread 

destruction without removing Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>Opposition leaders stressed that a large-scale offensive by Washington and 

its allies would not be supported by opponents of the Baghdad regime, either inside 

or outside Iraq.</p>

</font>In response to repeated reports of the Bush administration preparing for 

war, with a 250,000-strong force, a number of prominent Iraqi defectors insisted 

that more focused, specialist strikes would have far more chance of success.</p> 

<p>In London, where more than 300 opposition military and political leaders are 

taking part in the first conference of its kind, delegates said large-scale Western 

attacks on Iraq were unnecessary because most Iraqi forces would turn against 

President Saddam at the outbreak of hostilities.</p>

<p>A former major-general, Najib al-Salhi, said: "The United States will not find 

support inside or outside Iraq for an offensive that would harm civilians, destroy 

infrastructure, and target troops not defending the regime.</p>

<p>"Any campaign must be limited to toppling Saddam. The army will not defend 

him and neither will the Republican Guard [elite troops thought to be loyal to 

the Iraqi leader]."</p>

<p>In Kuwait, a former Iraqi intelligence chief also warned Washington that a 

land war could leave a desperate Iraqi regime with no option but to use weapons 

of mass destruction. Wafiq al-Samarrai said: "The US should know that Saddam will 

not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction on American military groupings. 

Diplomacy is the only choice for the United States."</p>

<p>Mr Samarrai, who is close to Ahmad Chalabi, the leader of the exiled Iraqi 

National Congress &#150; seen by some in Washington as a possible post-Saddam 

leader &#150; added: "If that fails then another option is an intelligence operation 

that targets the regime only.</p>

<p>"Efforts must focus on core issues to topple the Iraqi regime by choosing the 

best, quickest, and least costly method for the Iraqi people and regional states 

... carrying out a swift intelligence operation."</p>

<p>The opposition leaders are also concerned that the US and Britain may incite 

Iraqis to rise against President Saddam and then fail to help, as happened at 

the end of the Gulf War.</p>

<p>Another former major-general, Tawfiq al-Yassiri, who led an uprising in southern 

Iraq at that time, and was wounded when Iraqi forces crushed the rebels, is among 

senior officers counseling caution to compatriots inside Iraq. They point out 

that it was the US President's father, George Bush Sr, who abandoned the rebels, 

and that some members of his administration were back in power in Washington.</p>

<p>The appearance at the conference of Prince Hassan of Jordan, an uncle of King 

Abdullah, increased speculation over the likelihood of war. Leaked Pentagon reports 

have stated that Jordan has agreed to become one of the bases for a US attack. 

This, however, has been denied by the king.</p>
