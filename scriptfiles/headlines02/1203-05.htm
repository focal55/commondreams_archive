<p>The Government's attempt to present Iraq as a uniquely evil regime turned into 

a public relations flop yesterday when the Iraqi dissident chosen to present it 

denounced the threat of war with Saddam Hussein and said Baghdad officials used 

British-made equipment as instruments of torture</p>

<p class="story">Amnesty International accused the Government of turning a blind 

eye to human rights abuses elsewhere in the world and seizing on the horrors in 

Iraq for political reasons.</p>

<p class="story">Hussain al-Shahristani, a former nuclear scientist who was tortured 

and jailed for 11 years for refusing to work on Saddam's secret nuclear programme, 

said: "When I was in jail I was held with British-made handcuffs. In the cells 

next door, I could hear the screams of people who were having holes drilled into 

their bones. Those drills were made in Britain."</p>

<p class="story">The Foreign Office's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;$sessionid$Z5VG2PR1YMN4ZQFIQMFCFFWAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2002/12/02/wirq202.xml" target="_new" lang="en.uk">23-page 

report</a> is drawn mainly from open sources, such as reports by Amnesty and Human 

Rights Watch, with a sprinkling of newer information from the Government.</p>

<p class="story">Officials said that, despite the horrors it catalogues, no decision 

had been taken on whether to create a Yugoslavia-style war crimes tribunal for 

Iraqi atrocities.</p>

<p class="story">"This selective attention to human rights is nothing but a cold 

and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists," said Irene 

Khan, Amnesty's secretary general.</p>

<p class="story">"Let us not forget that these same governments turned a blind 

eye to Amnesty's reports of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before 

the Gulf war."</p>

<p class="story">At a briefing for journalists, the Foreign Office projected a 

video montage depicting Iraqi detainees being beaten and executed, and of the 

aftermath of the Iraqi gas attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja in 1988.</p>

<p class="story">Mr al-Shahristani quickly strayed from the script. He nodded 

approvingly when Foreign Office officials were confronted with a barrage of questions 

about Britain's silence at the time of the Halabja massacre, its support for Iraq 

in the 1980s and accusations that the Government was trying to build a case for 

war.</p>

<p class="story">He rejected the idea of another conflict: "I am extremely concerned 

about the consequences of this intervention on the Iraqi people.</p>

<p class="story">"I am particularly concerned that weapons of mass destruction 

could be used again by the Iraqi regime against the people if there should be 

any opposition or uprising." He added: "The Iraqi people could pay the price of 

this war, as they have paid the price of sanctions and all the previous wars."</p>

<p class="story">The Government dossier lists several methods of torture, including 

eye gouging, piercing of hands with electric drills, suspension from the ceiling, 

electric shock, sexual abuse, beating the soles of the feet, mock executions and 

acid baths. The report says: "Fear is Saddam's chosen method for staying in power."</p>

<p class="story">Some of the cases highlighted include:</p>

<li><span class="listory">A husband and wife were tortured separately about the 

sale of a car which, investigators claimed, had been seized during a raid on Iraqi 

opposition activists. The woman was stripped, burnt with a lit cigarette and beaten 

while her children were forced to watch. Her husband's arms were tied behind his 

back and he was suspended from a hook. Later, he was shot at with a pistol and 

his feet and hands were mutilated with gunshots. Eventually the family paid a 

bribe and the couple was released and managed to flee the country.</span></li>

<p class="story"></p>

<li><span class="listory">Saddam's son, Uday, maintains "a private torture chamber" 

in Baghdad, and "personally executed dissidents in Basra" during the 1991 uprising. 

He also "ordered the national football team to be caned on the soles of their 

feet after losing a World Cup qualifying match".</span></li>

<p class="story"></p>

<li><span class="listory">Women are routinely beheaded on charges of prostitution. 

The identity card of one Iraqi militiaman, Aziz Salih Ahmed, is reproduced and 

describes his occupation as "violation of women's honour", that is, a professional 

rapist.</span></li>

<p class="story"></p>

<li><span class="listory">Horrendous prison conditions, such as the "Casket Prison" 

in Baghdad, where "prisoners are kept in rows of steel boxes, as found in mortuaries, 

until they either confess to their crimes or die. There are around 100-150 boxes, 

which are opened for half an hour a day to allow the prisoners some light and 

air".</span></li>

<p class="story"></p>

<li><span class="listory">A commander's letter chastising a subordinate, saying: 

"There is no objection to cutting off the heads of traitors. But it would have 

been preferable had you also sent them to security for the purpose of interrogating 

them."</span></li>

<p class="story"></p>

<li><span class="listory">A decree passed in 2000 allowing the amputation of the 

tongue as a penalty for insulting the president or his family.</span></li>
