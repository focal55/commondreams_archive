</table>A classified Pentagon report has warned that the US must be ready to use nuclear weapons against China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria and also in an Arab-Israeli conflict. The report, provided to Congress in January and signed by hawkish US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, said weapons could be used in three types of situations.  

<P>The first was against targets able to withstand non-nuclear attack, the second in retaliation for attack with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and the third 'in the event of surprising military developments'.  

<P>A spokesman for the Pentagon last night confirmed the existence of the document, called the 'Nuclear Posture Review', which was written with the knowledge of President George W. Bush and leaked to the Los Angeles Times.  

<P>News that the US has drawn up options for potential nuclear attack against hostile nations will alarm MPs already opposed to the continuing war on terror and comes ahead of a visit to Britain tomorrow by Vice-President Dick Cheney.  

<P>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said: 'This completely changes the terms of debate about nuclear deterence. America has said that it can now act unilaterally and that it could use nuclear weapons against nations who do not have nuclear capability. Britain will have to think very carefully now about its support for systems such as the national missile defense system.'  

<P>Defense experts said the US had already acknowledged existing nuclear plans for an attack on Russia. However, the report appears to show for the first time an official list of potential target countries.  

<P>'This is dynamite,' said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear arms expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. Referring to the countries on the target list, he told the Los Angeles Times: 'I can imagine what these countries are going to be saying at the UN.'  

<P>Experts said the report's conclusions on the development of smaller nuclear weapons could signal a seachange in opinion by the US in using nuclear weapons except as a last resort and even trigger a new arms race. They warned that such moves could dangerously destabilize the world by encouraging other countries to believe that they, too, should develop weapons.  

<P>'They're trying desperately to find new uses for nuclear weapons, when their uses should be limited to deterrence,' said John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World. 'This is very, very dangerous talk. Dr Strangelove is clearly still alive in the Pentagon.'  

<P>Other defense figures urged caution and said the US could be simply preparing a 'wishlist' of possible contingencies in the event that dozens of countries, and some terrorist groups, are engaged in secret weapon development programs.

<P>'We need to have a credible deterrence against regimes involved in international terrorism and development of weapons of mass destruction,' said Jack Spencer, a defense analyst. He said the contents of the report did not surprise him and represent 'the right way to develop a nuclear posture for a post-Cold War world.'  

<P>Reports last night said the US Congress requested the reassessment of the US nuclear capability in September 2000. The last such review was conducted in 1994 by the Clinton administration. The new report is now being used by the US Strategic Command to prepare a nuclear war plan.  

<P>Bush administration officials have publicly provided only sketchy details of the nuclear review. They have publicly emphasized the parts of the policy suggesting that the administration wants to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons.  

<P>US politicians have suggested nuclear weapons would not be used against non-nuclear states unless they were allied with nuclear powers. But experts are unsure whether the United States would use nuclear weapons in retaliation after strikes with chemical or nuclear weapons.</p>
