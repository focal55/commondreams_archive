<p> COLUMBUS, GEORGIA -- One of three Bay Area residents found guilty of trespassing 

at Fort Benning, the site of a U.S. Army school that allegedly trains foreign 

officers in assassination techniques, was sentenced to six months in jail Friday 

by a federal judge. 

<P>The Rev. Bill O'Donnell of St. Joseph the Workman Church in Berkeley also 

was fined $1,000 after being convicted earlier this week of trespassing at the 

Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation in the fall.

<P>Two other protesters from the Bay Area, Berkeley peace activist Leone 

Reinbold and the Rev. Louis Vitale of St. Boniface Church in San Francisco, 

also were convicted and were awaiting their sentences late Friday night.

</table></font>They were among 43 demonstrators arrested last year while protesting the 

school's alleged involvement in training foreign security and intelligence 

officers in lethal arts.

<P>Thirty-seven of the demonstrators were tried on trespassing charges before 

U.S. Magistrate Mallon Faircloth, and all but one were found guilty.

<P>O'Donnell, 72, was among the first to be sentenced Friday morning. He said 

the court's action showed its "moral bankruptcy" and told Faircloth the 

courthouse should have a sign above its door saying, "Abandon hope all ye who 

enter here."

<P>Reinbold, 24, was awaiting her sentence Friday night and told The Chronicle 

the experience had been nerve-racking, but instructive.

<P>"The testimony has been amazing," she said. "I have been in wonderful 

company. . . . It has been a good experience in many ways. I only hope prison 

is as much of a learning experience."

<P>The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly known 

as the School of the Americas, is a specialized training center at Fort 

Benning. It instructs as many as 900 soldiers and police officers from other 

nations annually in a variety of subjects, including civil disorder management,

<P>collecting and analyzing military intelligence and anti-drug operations.

<P>Critics allege that the institute also trains students in techniques of 

torture and assassination, pointing to a number of incidents in which 

graduates of the school have been implicated in atrocities in Latin America. 

The critics want the school closed permanently and have repeatedly held 

demonstrations at the site.

<P>The school's officials deny training foreign military and security 

personnel to commit acts of terror and say they have instituted human rights 

training as a regular part of their curriculum.

<P>"Those who want the school closed mean well, but their information is 

simply incorrect," said Gina DiNicolo, a spokeswoman for the institute.

<P>But critics such as U.S. Army Maj. Joe Blair, a former director of 

instruction at the school who testified in behalf of the defendants during 

this week's proceedings, say there is little difference between the institute 

and the School of the Americas.

<P>"There are no substantive changes besides the name," Blair testified during 

the trial. "They teach the identical courses that I taught, and changed the 

course names and use the same manuals."
