<p>UNITED NATIONS - </b> Friday's unanimous vote in the U.N. Security Council 

supporting the U.S. resolution on weapons inspections in Iraq was a demonstration 

of Washington's ability to wield its vast political and economic power, say observers. 

<p> ''Only a superpower like the United States could have pulled off a coup like 

this,'' an Asian diplomat told IPS.

The unanimous 15-0 vote, he said, was obtained through considerable political 

and diplomatic pressure. The lobbying, he added, was not done at the United Nations, 

but in various capitals. 

<p> Besides its five veto-wielding permanent members - the United States, Britain, 

France, China and Russia - the Security Council also consists of 10 non-permanent, 

rotating members who hold office for two years. 

<p> France, China and Russia, in almost a single voice, said they decided to back 

the resolution because of assurances by the United States that it would return 

to the Security Council before launching a military attack on Iraq. The resolution, 

they argued, does not provide the United States with the automatic use of military 

force. 

<p> But the 10 non-permanent members - Cameroon, Guinea, Mauritius, Bulgaria, 

Colombia, Mexico, Singapore, Norway, Ireland and Syria - voted under heavy diplomatic 

and economic pressure from the United States. 

<p> Nine votes and no vetoes were the minimum needed to adopt the resolution. 

Of the five big powers, Britain had co-sponsored the U.S. resolution. In a worst-case 

scenario, U.S. officials were expecting the other three permanent members - Russia, 

China and France - to abstain on the vote. 

<p> That meant the votes of the 10 non-permanent members took on added significance. 

Of the 10, the two Western nations, Ireland and Norway, were expected to vote 

with the United States. 

<p> Syria, a ''radical'' Arab nation listed as a ''terrorist state'' by the U.S. 

State Department, was expected to either vote against or abstain. 

<p> So the arm-twisting was confined mostly to the remaining seven countries, 

who depend on the United States either for economic or military aid - or both. 

<p> All these countries were seemingly aware of the fact that in 1990 the United 

States almost overnight cut about 70 million dollars in aid to Yemen immediately 

following its negative vote against a U.S. sponsored Security Council resolution 

to militarily oust Iraq from Kuwait. 

<p> Last week, Mauritius' U.N. ambassador, Jagdish Koonjul, was temporarily recalled 

by his government because he continued to convey the mistaken impression that 

his country had reservations about the U.S. resolution against Iraq. 

<p> ''The Yemen precedent remains a vivid institutional memory at the United Nations,'' 

Phyllis Bennis, a fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies, 

told IPS. 

<p> Bennis said that just after that 1990 vote, the U.S. envoy turned to the Yemeni 

ambassador and told him that his vote would be ''the most expensive 'no' vote 

you would ever cast''. The United States then promptly cut the entire 70 million 

dollar U.S. aid budget to Yemen. 

<p> The latest incarnation of that reality, Bennis said, came from the island 

nation of Mauritius, which joined the Security Council last year under U.S. sponsorship. 

<p> The U.S. aid package to the impoverished country, authorised by the U.S. African 

Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), demands that the aid recipient ''does not engage 

in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests''. 

<p> Fear of being accused of acting contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests 

plays a role ''not only for Mauritius, but also for any country dependent on U.S. 

economic assistance'', added Bennis. 

<p> Colombia, one of the world's leading producer of cocaine and an important 

supplier of heroin to the U.S. market, received about 380 million dollars in U.S. 

grants under the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) programme 

this year. The proposed amount earmarked for 2003 is 439 million dollars. 

<p> Under the same programme, Mexico received about 10 million dollars last year 

and 12 million dollars this year. It also received 28.2 million dollars in U.S. 

Economic Support Funds (ESF). 

<p> Guinea, another of the non-permanent members in the Security Council, received 

three million dollars in outright U.S. military grants last year and is expected 

to get 20.7 million dollars in development assistance next year. 

<p> Cameroon is not only entitled to receive free surplus U.S. weapons but also 

receives about 2.5 million dollars in annual grants for military education and 

training. 

<p> After Colombia, the largest single beneficiary of U.S. aid is Bulgaria, which 

received 13.5 million dollars in outright military grants (mostly to buy U.S. 

weapons systems) last year and an additional 8.5 million dollars this year. The 

amount earmarked for 2003 is 9.5 million dollars. 

<p> Additionally, Bulgaria has received 69 million dollars in aid under a U.S. 

programme called Support for East European Democracy (SEED). Next year's proposed 

grant is 28 million dollars. 

<p> Besides Syria, Singapore is the only country in the Security Council that 

does not receive economic or military aid from the United States. 

<p> But the United States is the biggest single arms supplier to Singapore, selling 

the Southeast Asian nations weapons worth 656.3 million dollars last year and 

an estimated 370 million dollars this year. 

<p> Could any of these countries easily stand up to the United States or refuse 

to fall in line with their benefactor or military ally? 

<p> James Abourezk, a former U.S. Senator, said he seriously doubts that any country 

receiving U.S. government aid could withstand the economic pressure to vote for 

a U.S. resolution at the Security Council. 

<p> ''It would be a tragedy,'' he told IPS, ''if a war were to be declared based 

on such pressure''.</p>
