<p>France's star anti-globalization activist Jose Bove was ordered to prison to 

serve a three-month jail sentence for his 1999 demolition of a McDonald's outlet.</p>

</font>Bove told AFP that police had handed him a summons to turn up to the Villeneuve 

les Maguelonne prison near the southern city of Montpellier early Wednesday.</p> 

<p>French authorities, fearing his incarceration could have upset presidential 

and parliamentary elections held over the past two months, had put off imposing 

the sentence handed down by a court in February.</p>

<p>But the last of the polls finished Sunday, ushering in a center-right government 

that has pledged to be tough on law-and-order issues and to implement President 

Jacques Chirac's "zero impunity" pledge on crime.</p>

<p>Bove, a mustachioed former farmer who has built a worldwide reputation for 

his active opposition to multinational companies, US trade policies and globalization's 

negative effects on workers and the poor, vowed to make his time behind bars as 

politically embarrassing for the new government as possible.</p>

<p>"I won't go alone. We've decided to go in a procession," he said.</p>

<p>"The first political decision of (Prime Minister Jean-Pierre) Raffarin's government 

and of the majority coming from Sunday's vote is to repress the labor movement.</p>

<p>"My incarceration is a clear message to the labor movement that challenges 

to globalization's will no longer be accepted."</p>

<p>Bove and a group of other farmers angry with punitive US trade tariffs on French 

goat cheese exports used tractors to tear apart a McDonald's fast-food restaurant 

under construction in the southern town on Millau in 1999.</p>

<p>He tried to have the criminal charges set aside, arguing that the action had 

been a political demonstration, but in February a court quashed that appeal and 

ruled that he would have to serve three months, minus the 20 days he had already 

spent in custody.</p>

<p>With good behavior, the total term could end up being as low as one month.</p>

<p>But authorities dragged their heels, loath to give the militant a stage during 

the sensitive election period.</p>

<p>"There is no way that the judicial institution is going to foul the electoral 

scene," Montpellier prosecutor Paul-Louis Aumeras said in April, explaining that 

Bove would not be jailed until after the final presidential polls on May 5.</p>

<p>Bove capitalized on the surprising decision.</p>

<p>He refused to cut any face-saving deal, telling AFP in April: "There is no 

room for negotiation -- either I'm free or I'm in prison."</p>

<p>And in the last few weeks he has been taunting police with regular queries 

about when, exactly, he could expect to be put behind bars.</p>

<p>Now he has his answer. And France's new government has its first challenge 

to its authority.</p>
