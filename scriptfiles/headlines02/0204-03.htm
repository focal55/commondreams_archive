NEW YORK (AP) - They came in solidarity with this terror-wounded

city.

<p> But since they arrived, speaker after speaker at the World Economic Forum 

has lambasted America as a smug superpower, too beholden to Israel at the expense 

of the Muslim world, and inattentive to the needs of poor countries or the advice 

of allies.

</table></font>With the forum wrapping up its five-day session Monday, some of

the criticism has been simple scolding by non-Western leaders. But

a large measure has come in public soul-searching by U.S.

politicians and business leaders.

<p> U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., cited a global poll that characterized 

Americans as selfish and bent on arranging the global economy for their own benefit. 

<p>

	   ``We've not done our fair share to take on some of the global

challenges'' like poverty, disease and women's rights, Clinton said

Sunday. ``We need to convince the U.S. public that this is a role

that we have to play.''

<p> Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates warned that the terms of international 

trade were too favorable to the rich world, a disparity that feeds resentment. 

<p>

	   ``People who feel the world is tilted against them will spawn

the kind of hatred that is very dangerous for all of us,'' Gates

said. ``I think it's a healthy sign that there are demonstrators in

the streets. They are raising the question of 'is the rich world

giving back enough?'''

<p>

	   Held in the Swiss ski resort of Davos in its first 31 years,

sponsors decided to move this year's forum to New York to show

support for the city after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

<p>

	   About 2,700 corporate and political leaders, clergy and

celebrities came to discuss the world's problems, and have spent

much time dissecting U.S. foreign policy, its possible role in

breeding terrorism and the potential harms of globalization.

<p>

	   Few protesters turned up Sunday near the Waldorf-Astoria hotel,

site of the forum, on the fourth day of the conference. But mostly

peaceful demonstrations miles from the hotel generated 159 arrests

- the largest in a single day since the conference started - and

one case of vandalism was reported.

<p>

	   The total arrested so far during the meeting grew to over 200,

mostly for disorderly conduct.

<p>

	   In a curious convergence, the titans of business and politics at

the meeting have seized on many of the same socially liberal issues

that they have been accused of ignoring at past gatherings.

<p>

	   The forum's agenda may have taken some of the steam out of

street protests, which were sparse except for Saturday's turnout of

about 7,000 demonstrators, and has even paralleled issues under

discussion at the World Social Forum, an anti-globalization

conference under way in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

<p>

	   In Brazil, speakers on Saturday condemned the Israeli occupation

of Palestinian lands, with one comparing the practice to

apartheid-era South Africa's creation of ``Bantustans,'' which were

economically poor areas designated as homelands for blacks.

<p>

	   In New York, guests heard a similar message Sunday.

<p>

	   Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. national security adviser,

warned that Palestinian violence risked evolving into large-scale

urban terror, while Israel's response ``will slide into a pattern

of behavior that resembles the South Africans.''

<p>

	   However, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Sunday he

saw ``a ray of hope'' for Mideast peace. New talks with the

Palestinians could lead to a cease-fire, and mutual recognition of

a Palestinian state and Israel's right to exist, he said.

<p>

	   Jordan's King Abdullah II called for ``international

intervention to help steer the parties from the brink,'' arguing

that the ``burning injustice of Palestine'' had ``fed extremism

around the world.''

<p>

	   Brzezinski called for Washington to create a parallel social

campaign to temper the anger against its military campaign against

terrorism, to ``appeal to a better future'' in poor countries.

<p>

	   ``It's very easy for the U.S. to slide into a kind of global

alliance for the sake of repression,'' Brzezinski said.

<p>

	   U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chided his colleagues in

Congress for giving too much foreign aid to Israel, the largest

recipient of American help, and said too little aid flows to the

neediest.

<p>

	   ``I've been critical of the aid we've given to Israel,'' Leahy

said in an interview. ``But the same complaint could be made of a

number of wealthy Muslim countries. They're not giving aid to the

poorest of their own people.''</p>
