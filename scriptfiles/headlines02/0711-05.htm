<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The 

future of car design could be changed by the signing of a bill in Sacramento, 

California this week. In what its supporters claim is the most significant environmental 

step in the motor industry in two decades, the new law would regulate the exhaust 

emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. 

<P>The car and oil industries are already mobilizing fierce opposition to the 

bill. They warn that it is a form of "social engineering" that could lead to more 

deaths on the roads, higher taxes and petrol costs, and the outlawing of the popular 

four-wheel drive SUV (sport utility vehicle) which has been blamed as one of the 

worst polluting culprits. 

<P>It also presents a major political challenge to Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat 

who is standing for re-election this November. He has 12 working days to decide 

whether or not to sign the bill, which was passed last week by both the state 

Senate and House of Representatives. 

<P>He has already come under pressure from the car industry, unions and the business 

world, but is aware that, if he does not sign the bill, he will lose the vital 

support of the environment movement and liberal Hollywood. An aide said a decision 

was likely this week. 

<P>California is a natural battleground for the bill. Its 23 million vehicles 

cause 58% of the greenhouse gas pollution in the state - compared to 31% in the 

rest of the US. 

<P>The bill has the support of a number of political big hitters, including the 

potential Democrat presidential candidates Joe Lieberman and John Kerry and the 

Republican senator John McCain. The actor Paul Newman also campaigned for the 

bill along with much of Hollywood. The American environmental movement sees it 

as a powerful rebuff to President Bush's reluctance to act on global warming. 

<P>America has refused to sign the Kyoto protocol, which commits rich countries 

to reducing emissions, even though the US is responsible for 24% of the world's 

manmade carbon emissions. 

<P>The bill directs the California air resources board to introduce regulations 

that would "achieve the maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases" by 2005. 

These new standards would then have to apply to every new model sold in the state 

from 2009 onwards. 

<P>At the heart of the argument is what the word "feasible" actually means in 

this context: the car industry claims it is so vague that it could be used to 

impose on them a completely new type of car; the bill's supporters say it means 

a common sense approach to changes. 

<P><B> Fuel saving</B>

<P> As California has the world's fifth-largest economy and represents 10% of 

the American car market, it could mean that US motor manufacturers will have to 

start making environmentally friendly cars within seven years. 

<P>While Japanese car manufacturers, in particular Honda, are already anticipating 

eventual moves to such cars, American makers had assumed that the election of 

Mr Bush guaranteed that there would be no immediate pressure to deal with car 

emissions. Now that could all change and with it the shape of cars as designers 

seek to incorporate fuel-saving engineering. All of which makes this a delicate 

decision for Governor Davis. 

<P>Mr Davis's opponent in this November's election, the Republican Bill Simon, 

has labeled the bill "social engineering" and a "thinly veiled attempt to regulate 

the kind of vehicles Californians are allowed to drive". But he has since added 

that "reviewing global warming, if indeed there is such a thing as global warming, 

is always a good idea". 

<P>The coalition fighting the bill includes the car and oil industries and their 

related unions. A spokesman for General Motors said last week that the bill was 

indicative of the power of the environmental movement in California. "Whether 

it's feasible, reasonable or in the best interests of the citizens often takes 

a back seat to the environmental agenda," he said. 

<P>Another opponent, Kenneth Green, chief scientist at the Reason Foundation, 

wrote in the LA Times last week that the bill would mean more expensive cars which 

in turn would mean that people had "less for other needs such as education and 

healthcare". Mr Green said the bill was "political carjacking at its worst". He 

argued that California motorists produced less than one quarter of 1% of the world's 

gas emissions linked to global warming. 

<P>"While climate change is still largely theoretical, the damaging effects of 

regulatory approaches like these are well-established facts," he wrote. "Not to 

put too fine a point on it, forcing people into smaller cars would kill some of 

them. The National Academy of Sciences has acknowledged that lighter and smaller 

cars are inherently more dangerous." 

<P>Opponents have also suggested that one of California's favorite vehicles, the 

SUV, may even be banned, a claim dismissed by the bill's backers. 

<P>Ed Begley Jr, the actor and environmental activist who has been campaigning 

hard for the bill, greeted its passage with enthusiasm. "It's great news," he 

said. Of the claims made by the car industry, he said: "There has been lots of 

hyperbole involved, a lot of scaremongering. It's the same chorus we hear every 

time changes are proposed, whether they're seat belts, air bags or catalytic converters." 

<P>Kevin Finney of the Clean Air Coalition said: "This was a battle of national 

significance. Neither the president nor Congress have shown much initiative, which 

makes it even more significant." 

<P>He predicted that the car industry would now seek to halt the bill through 

civil actions. It might also try to get the issue onto a state ballot, he said, 

which would delay the bill's passage and allow for a television advertising campaign 

urging people to reject it. But, according to a survey by the Public Policy Institute 

of California, 81% of Californians support the bill. Even 77% of SUV-owners back 

it. 

<P>If, as anticipated, Governor Davis signs it into law, it may finally trigger 

a major national debate on global warming, greenhouse gases and the car industry. 

Now, after years of suffering rebuffs on the issue, the environmental movement 

is in the driving seat. 

<P><b>Future fuels</b>

<P><B> Hybrid</B> 

<P>Combines petrol and other fuels. Toyota Prius, petrol and electric-powered, 

has half the emissions of average car and still does 99mph 

<P><B> Electric</B> 

<P>Often used by public utilities but not for long journeys. Low top speed. Recharging 

takes up to 8 hours 

<P><B> Hydrogen</B> 

<P>Suzuki has developed car that converts hydrogen produced from the gas supply 

into electricity. Still in early stages 

<P><B> Bio-fuel</B> 

<P>Powered by rape seed and other natural fuels. Problem is quantity of rape seed 

needed and land required 

<P><B> Bi-fuel</B> 

<P>Uses petrol and less damaging liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Volvo and Vauxhall 

among the pioneers </p>
