NATIONS - Arguing that peacekeepers are not above the law, Canada said on Wednesday 

the U.N. Security Council did not have the power to rewrite treaties so Washington 

could get immunity for its soldiers from the world's first permanent criminal 

court.

</table>Canadian Ambassador Paul Heinbecker called a public council debate so any countries 

could challenge the Bush administration and tell the 15 council members to reject 

weakening the International Criminal Court. 

<p>

And they did, from New Zealand to South Africa and Jordan to Brazil. Only

India took Washington's side, with its ambassador, V.K. Nambiar, saying the

council should give "careful consideration" to the views of countries

contributing troops.

<p>

At issue is Washington's threat to end peacekeeping in Bosnia and

everywhere else, if all civilian and military personnel, even those not under

direct U.N. jurisdiction, are not exempt from prosecution from the court, which

came into existence on July 1.

<p>

U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte gave no hint the United States had modified

its position to have all peacekeepers in Bosnia immune from the court's

jurisdiction for as long as the U.N. mission exists.

<p>

Otherwise, he said "it certainly will affect our ability to contribute

peacekeepers." With few U.S. combat troops in U.N. missions, the bigger danger

is Congress cutting off peacekeeping funds, thereby closing down most missions.

<p>

The court, the first global permanent tribunal to try individuals for

genocide, war crimes and systematic, gross human rights abuses, is a belated

effort to fulfill the promise of the Nuremberg trials 56 years ago, when Nazi

leaders were prosecuted for new categories of war crimes.

<p>

Britain, France and others have considered a 12-month deferral of immunity

from prosecution under Article 16 of the court's statutes, depending on the

wording. They are waiting for the U.S. to offer a revised proposal but so far

Washington wants immunity for as long as the Bosnia mission exists.

<p>

"But even if the council goes this way, it raises serious questions," said

French Ambassador Jean-David Levitte. He said "we must not take hostage" the 16

U.N. peacekeeping missions around the world.

<p>

But Canada's Heinbecker said even a 12-month exemption for the reasons the

United States raised was illegal. The negotiating history of Article 16 makes

clear exemptions can only be given on a case-by-case basis, such as during

peace negotiations, he said.

<p>

The U.S. proposals would "send an unacceptable message that some people --

peacekeepers -- are above the law," he said.

<p>

No vote was planned for Wednesday. However, the Security Council has to

make a decision by Monday.

<p>

Six of the 15 council members are among the 76 nations that have ratified a

1998 Rome treaty setting up the court. All others, except China and Singapore,

have signed the pact.

<p>

Referring to the Holocaust museum in Washington, Jordan's U.N. ambassador,

Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid al-Hussein, said the artifacts showed "shamefully just

how primordial we human beings still are." For the council to consider anything

else but how to assist the court "is to offer comfort to those criminals of

tomorrow," he said.

<p>

But the Bush administration argues that countries could use the court to

try American soldiers or political figures for war crimes and jeopardize U.S.

sovereignty.

<p>

Supporters of the court say there are so many safeguards, they fear few

cases will come before the tribunal. The court, can only prosecute individuals

whose governments are unable or unwilling to do so.

<p>

Washington wants a more blanket exemption, rejecting bilateral agreements

as insufficient.

<p> The Bosnia operation was obviously chosen because it came up for renewal as 

the ICC treaty went into force. Otherwise the choice is peculiar as the NATO-led 

troops are not under U.N. command but are endorsed by the Security Council. 

<p>

In addition, the Balkans are under the jurisdiction of an ad hoc Yugoslav

war crimes U.N. tribunal, which takes precedent over the ICC and has fewer

restrictions than the new court.</p>
