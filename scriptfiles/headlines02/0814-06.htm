<p> TEHRAN - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused President Bush 

Wednesday of using the same language as Adolf Hitler to bully the world.

<p>Khamenei, the most powerful man in Iran, has been opposed  to any rapprochement with Washington, which in turn has branded  Iran part of an "axis of evil" for allegedly pursuing weapons  of mass destruction, backing terrorism and sheltering fleeing  al-Qaeda fighters.<p>"Arrogance has drawn the bullying West into disgrace," the  official IRNA news agency quoted Khamenei as saying, "and the  president of a country which claims to support human rights and  freedom speaks the same language to the people of the world as  Hitler used."<p>Iranian leaders have been at odds about how to respond to  the American accusations. President Mohammad Khatami's  reformist allies have called for dialogue with Washington to  ward off possible military attack, but hard-liners led by  Khamenei have quashed such talk.<p>Khamenei is both Iran's spiritual leader and the final  authority on matters of state.<p>His comments come in the wake of news that Iran has  surrendered 16 suspected al Qaeda fighters to Saudi Arabia in  the knowledge that any intelligence gleaned from their  interrogation would be passed to the United States, its ally.<p>Al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, is believed by Washington  to be responsible for last September's airliner attacks on  Washington and New York.<p>Iranian reformist analysts saw the handover as a sign that  the Islamic Republic was seeking to mollify Washington amid  signs that it is gearing up for an attack on neighboring Iraq  to topple President Saddam Hussein.<p>With a U.S.-friendly government in Afghanistan to the east,  Iran is wary of another pro-Western state emerging in Iraq, to  the west. Many in Tehran fear Iran could be next on the  hit-list of Bush's "war on terror."<p>Khamenei's defiant words appeared to offer no hope of an  improvement in relations between Tehran and Washington, which  have been enemies ever since radical students stormed the U.S.  embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held dozens of diplomats hostage  for 444 days.<p>A government spokesman Wednesday also denied there was any  link between the handover of al Qaeda suspects to Saudi Arabia  and any attempt to curry favor in Washington.<p>"A number of foreigners who illegally crossed into Iran  were arrested and the relevant embassies were informed,"  Abdollah Ramazanzadeh told a news conference.

<p>"Those arrested included individuals from European, Arab and African countries. 

The number was higher than 16."</span>
