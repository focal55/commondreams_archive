<p>The United States government is actively intervening in Bolivia's choice of 

new president next month, warning that US aid will be withdrawn if the socialist 

Evo Morales is appointed. 

<P>It is the latest in a series of recent interventions by the US in Latin American 

elections in an attempt to keep leftwing politicians from power.

Union Workers and civil leaders in downtown La Paz, July 12, 2002. Thousands of 

demostrators of union workers were protesting against the possible future use 

of Chilean territory, to export natural gas to North America. Chile and Bolivia 

have maintained only consular ties since 1978 due to territorial disputes. Bolivia 

lost territory, including an outlet to the sea, during a war with Chile in 1879.

</table></font>Congress will elect the president from the two leading candidates in the elections 

of two weeks ago: Mr Morales and the rightwing ex-president Gonzalo Sanchez de 

Lozada. 

<P>Otto Reich, the Cuban-American appointed by President George Bush as his assistant 

secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, warned that American aid to 

the country would be in danger if Mr Morales was chosen on August 3. 

<P>Mr Morales is leader of the country's coca-growers and is opposed to the coca 

eradication program sponsored by the US as part of the "war on drugs" on the continent. 

<P>"We do not believe we could have normal relations with someone who espouses 

these kinds of policies," Mr Reich said on a visit to Buenos Aires. 

<P>The US ambassador to Bolivia, Manuel Rocha, had already issued a similar warning, 

suggesting that if Mr Morales was elected US aid would be cut off. 

<P>"The Bolivian electorate must consider the consequences of choosing leaders 

somehow connected with drug trafficking and terrorism," said Mr Rocha in a speech 

last month. "I want to remind the Bolivian electorate that if they vote for those 

who want Bolivia to return to exporting cocaine, that will seriously jeopardize 

any future aid to Bolivia from the United States." 

<P>But the comments appeared to infuriate Bolivians and enhanced the popularity 

of Mr Morales who called the ambassador his "best campaign chief". 

<P>Mr Reich's intervention is the latest in a series of moves to influence politics 

in the region. He has been criticized for the way the US administration was seen 

as giving the green light to the military coup in Venezuela in April which would 

have removed the leftwing president, Hugo Chavez. Mr Chavez was returned to power 

after 48 hours but is still thought to be at risk from another possible coup attempt. 

<P>Last year, the US intervened in the Nicaraguan elections, warning that if the 

Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega, won, there would be disastrous financial consequences 

for the country. A US state department official, Lino Gutierrez, visited the country 

to urge the conservative parties running against Mr Ortega to bury their differences 

to defeat him. Mr Ortega lost the election heavily although the US intervention 

was far from the decisive factor. 

<P>Mr Reich is a controversial figure in Latin-American politics. Under Ronald 

Reagan, he was the head of the office of public diplomacy at the state department 

and used his position to promote the cause of the "contras" in their war against 

the Sandinistas. 

<P>In an investigation in 1987 by the comptroller-general of the US he was found 

to have abused his office which had been engaged in "prohibited, covert propaganda 

activities... beyond the range of acceptable public information activities". 

<P>He was appointed to his current post despite strong opposition from Democrats 

on the foreign relations committee.</p>
