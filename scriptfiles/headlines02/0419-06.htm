Moves by French and Spanish investigators to question Henry Kissinger for "terrorist 

crimes" have been welcomed by protesters planning to disrupt the former United 

States Secretary of State's talk to 2,500 business leaders at a convention in 

Britain next week. 

<p> 

Spanish newspapers reported Thursday that a Spanish judge, Baltazar Garzon, had 

asked British authorities for permission to question Kissinger while he is in 

London to address the April 24 annual convention of the Institute of Directors 

(IoD). They also cited a similar request to Interpol, the international police 

network, from a French judge. 

<p> Both men were quoted as saying that the moves related to Kissinger's role 

in abuses which took place in Chile under former dictator Augusto Pinochet. They 

referred particularly to "Operation Condor," in which five Latin American rulers 

worked together to get rid of opponents, and the disappearance of a number of 

Europeans in Chile after the coup d'etat that brought Pinochet to power in 1973. 

<p> It was on similar grounds that Pinochet was arrested during a private visit 

to London in 1998. After Britain's highest court ruled that he could be extradited 

to Spain to stand trial on charges of torture and conspiracy, the human rights 

organization Amnesty International said, "The message is loud and clear: head-of-state 

immunity does not grant freedom to commit crimes against humanity and acts of 

torture." Pinochet was subsequently freed on grounds of ill-health. 

<p> Kissinger's presence in Britain next week will prompt calls from human rights 

and global justice campaigners for the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair 

to hold the 79-year-old to account under the principle of "universal jurisdiction," 

which gives national courts the power to prosecute anyone on their territory suspected 

of committing a crime against humanity. 

<p> "We are against the idea of Kissinger coming to this country," said Guy Taylor 

of London-based Globalize Resistance, adding, however, that he would support any 

domestic legal moves against the Harvard-educated National Security Adviser to 

former U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. 

<p> The radical group is using leaflets, posters, and the Internet to generate 

support for a morning demonstration next Wednesday outside London's Royal Albert 

Hall where IoD delegates are scheduled to gather for a breakfast meeting. Campaigners 

staged a mock trial of Kissinger earlier this week, at which the "chief prosecutor" 

was veteran peace-activist Bruce Kent. 

<p> Taylor said the protesters were concerned not only with Kissinger's activities 

in Chile, but also with the 1969 bombing of Cambodia, an attempt to thwart the 

independence struggle of Bangladesh, and the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, 

among other interventions which have caused major political shifts on the international 

stage. 

<p> An IoD spokesman said Kissinger had been invited to address the conference 

because he was "one of the world's most respected individuals." In addition to 

being an entertaining speaker, he said, Kissinger's varied experience was relevant 

to the meeting's theme, "Globalization - the real nature and impact." 

<p> Harvard-educated Kissinger was the joint winner of a Nobel peace prize in 

1973 for his part in arranging a ceasefire in Vietnam. He was also the author 

of a round of secret diplomacy that led to the opening of relations between the 

US and communist China.
