<p>Washington stepped up its saber-rattling against Iraq, saying it is determined to see Saddam Hussein removed from power, as the defiant Iraqi leader vowed that he would never be defeated.</p>

<p>"The Iraqi regime, hostile to the United States and supporting terrorism, is a danger that we cannot afford to live with indefinitely," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told reporters here after talks with Turkish leaders.</p>

<p>In Baghdad meanwhile, Saddam had fighting words of his own.</p>

<p>In a televised speech marking the 34th anniversary of the coup that brought his Baath Party to power, Saddam said: "Iraq will emerge eventually triumphant."</p>

<p>Evoking the return of the "July revolution," he said: "You will never defeat me this time. Never! Even if you come together from all over the world, and invite all the devils as well."</p>

<p>The administration of US President George W. Bush has openly threatened to take military action against Iraq and unseat Saddam, whom it accuses of developing weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>The prospect of US military action loomed larger after the breakdown of July 4-5 talks between Baghdad and the United Nations on the return of UN weapons inspectors to Iraq -- which has been under crippling sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.</p>

<p>Media leaks have revealed an alleged plan calling for a massive US air, land and sea invasion of Iraq from three directions, including the use of bases in Jordan to stage air and commando operations.</p>

<p>The leaks embarrassed the White House and compromised relations with Jordan and other Arab allies, with Amman and Abu Dhabi issuing a statement Wednesday registering their opposition to a US military strike.</p>

<p>They said military action "would have grave repercussions not only in that country but also on regional security and stability."</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, furious over the media leaks, circulated a memo to Pentagon officials ordering them to stop disclosures of classified information.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his deputy Wolfowitz has been in Turkey to sound out Ankara over the US campaign, finding similar skittishness about military action against its neighbor to the south.</p>

<p>The United States has anxiously been watching the political turmoil in Turkey, a key NATO ally and cornerstone of its containment policy against Iraq.</p>

<p>But Turkey, engulfed in a severe political and economic crisis over the past 10 weeks, has little room to manuever, commentators said, although it has pressed Washington to keep it abreast of its plans.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit met with Wolfowitz despite a new wave of defections from his party that caused his fractious coalition government to lose its parliamentary majority and led him to call for early elections in November.</p>

<p>Wolfowitz said Washington had not yet specifically sought the support of Turkey, while a Turkish official said Ankara had reiterated its reservations over military moves, fearing "unfavorable" repercussions on the country and the region.</p>

<p>Ankara is wary that an operation against Baghdad may help the Kurds in northern Iraq to set up an independent state, which could have a domino effect on its own Kurds at a time when a bloody Kurdish rebellion in the southeast of the country has abated.</p>

<p>The US official argued however: "When there is a democratic Iraq it will not be only the people of Iraq that will benefit from that, it will benefit the whole world and very much this region."</p>

<p>The mainly Muslim but staunchly pro-Western Turkey is home to a US base that was used to launch strikes against Baghdad in the 1991 Gulf War and which remains in use to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair lent new support to US plans against Iraq, saying: "The issue of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq is an issue we have to deal with. It won't go away."</p>

<p>He added that a new UN resolution would not necessarily be required for any 

military action against Iraq, but said any such action must be in accordance with 

international law.</p>
