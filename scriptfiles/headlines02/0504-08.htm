PANCEVO, Yugoslavia (Reuters) - Three years ago, NATO

bombed a petrochemical plant and oil refinery at Pancevo near

the Danube river, sending a huge black cloud into the sky and

releasing more than 2,000 tons of noxious chemicals.

</table></font>The town's 140,000 residents still are waiting for a

clean-up -- and their fate is reflected elsewhere in

poverty-stricken Yugoslavia as it struggles with the poisonous

twin legacies of war and dirty socialist-era industry.

<P>

<P> "This town has a huge ecological problem," Pancevo Mayor

Borislava Kruska told Reuters. "I'm very, very concerned. We

are dealing with toxic, carcinogenic material."

<P>

<P> She complained that U.N.-led efforts to clear the hazard

had moved too slowly, but acknowledged that the dilapidated

complex already was an environmental headache before the Kosovo

war.

<P>

<P> Pancevo's pollution woes show that the reformers who ousted

Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslav leader in 2000 have their work

cut out for them to improve environmental standards, which

until now largely have been ignored.

<P>

<P> They need to redress years of neglect and under-investment

in new technology as well as the impact of sanctions and air

strikes against Milosevic's Yugoslavia, which left traces of

depleted uranium munitions at several locations.

<P>

<P> "We are facing a very big task," said Andjelka Mihajlov,

who heads the environmental protection unit of the health

ministry of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.

<P>

<P> BELGRADE NO WHITE CITY

<P>

<P> Beograd (Belgrade) means White City in Serbian, although

these days that name belies its familiar grime-encrusted

concrete.

<P>

<P> A Western consulting firm recently ranked it among the

dirtiest cities in the world, an indication of the scope of the

challenge to narrow the environmental gap with the European

Union, the wealthy Western bloc it hopes to join around 2010.

<P>

<P> "Belgrade has never been so dirty," said Bane, a

31-year-old born in the city of 2 million people. "It has

become a lot worse in the past 10 years."

<P>

<P> Like others in eastern Europe in the Cold War, old

socialist Yugoslavia focused on industrial growth, paying

little attention to environmental issues in comparison to

Western countries. But its environmental standards were still

higher than in the Soviet bloc.

<P>

<P> During the Milosevic era, when Yugoslavia plunged into

poverty, the over-riding priority for many Serbs was staying

alive, not keeping rivers and forests clean.

<P>

<P> "Environmental issues were sleeping during these eight to

nine years," Mihajlov said. "Some things were put on paper but

not implemented."

<P>

<P> Eleven weeks of NATO bombing caused more damage, especially

in Pancevo, just a few miles up the road from Belgrade, and

three other "hot spots" that a U.N. expert mission identified

as in need of urgent action after the war.

<P>

<P> U.N. scientists said in March they had also found

widespread traces of depleted uranium from NATO munitions at

five other sites in Serbia and the coastal republic of

Montenegro.

<P>

<P> They said the level of contamination posed no immediate

health threat but still urged precautionary measures.

<P>

<P> Mihajlov said the government was stepping up its

environmental efforts with plans to create a dedicated

ministry. It also has drafted a protection law with the help of

Western experts.

<P>

<P> But Serbia faces a tricky balancing act with so many

pressing priorities. Most factories would have to close if

strict standards were introduced overnight, a social disaster

in a country with a jobless rate of at least 30 percent.

<P>

<P> "The environment is a high priority for the government of

Serbia but not the first priority," Mihajlov said.

<P>

<P> SEWAGE IN THE DANUBE

<P>

<P> In its quality of life survey published in March, Mercer

Human Resource Consulting said Belgrade scored an environmental

rating of only 53 points, based on the level of air pollution

and the efficiency of waste disposal and sewage systems.

<P>

<P> It came nowhere near the cleanest city, Calgary in Canada

at 166, and was also below other eastern European cities.

<P>

<P> That will come as no surprise for visitors to Belgrade, a

run-down city where battered old cars spew out fumes and sewage

is dumped into the rivers.

<P>

<P> "Air pollution is worse than it was before," Mihajlov said.

"No city in Serbia has a waste-water treatment plant.

Everything goes into the Danube."

<P>

<P> In Pancevo, Mayor Kruska suggested that the bombed

industrial complex should not have been built on the edge of

the town in the first place, even if the jobs were needed. "We

all knew it was dangerous ... that it was attacking our lungs

... our health."

<P>

<P> Nothing was invested in the plants during sanctions,

leaving them "rotten, old and neglected," she said. Then NATO

struck, causing a huge spill of oil, mercury and other toxic

substances.

<P>

<P> A U.N. team sent to Yugoslavia after the conflict urged the

immediate cleaning up of pollution caused by the bombing in

four "hot spots" -- Pancevo, the central town of Kragujevac,

Novi Sad in the north and the Bor mining center in eastern

Serbia.

<P>

<P> The U.N. Environmental Program identified 27 priority

projects, estimating the cost at &#36;20 million, of which just

over half has been raised. Pancevo was the worst affected, and

clean-up work there is lagging behind the others.

<P>

<P> NATO insisted that such industries were legitimate targets

in its campaign to end Serbian repression of Kosovo's Albanian

majority. Kruska said it should now foot the bill for causing

an "ecological catastrophe."

<P>

<P> U.N. project coordinator Dennis Bruhn painted a more

nuanced picture, saying the bombing's short-term impact was

limited. "The long-term damage could be huge. We don't know

about that yet."

<P>

<P> Visiting the war-scarred petrochemical plant in Pancevo, he

said good progress had been made but suggested not everything

could be removed unless donors gave more money. "You wouldn't

have enough funds to go all the way," he said.
