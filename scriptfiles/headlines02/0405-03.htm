</font>Mr Peres accepted the peace prize jointly with the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israel's late prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, in 1994.  

<P>&nbsp;

<FONT FACE="sans-serif" SIZE="2">







In an interview with a Norwegian newspaper, committee members said they regretted that Mr Peres' prize could not be recalled because, as a member of the Israeli cabinet, he had not acted to prevent Israel's re-occupation of Palestinian territory. 

<P>

One member said Mr Peres had not lived up to the ideals he expressed when he accepted the prize.

<P>

"What is happening today in Palestine is grotesque and unbelievable," said Hanna Kvanmo. 

<P>

"Peres is responsible, as part of the government. He  has expressed his agreement with what [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon is doing," she said.

<P>



"If he had not agreed with Sharon, then he would have withdrawn from the government."

<P>

Oslo Bishop Gunnar Stalsett, a committee member for the past eight years, describes as "absurd"  what he sees as the involvement of a Nobel laureate in human rights abuses.

<P>

Other committee members argue that the Israeli government's actions in general and Mr Peres' involvement in particular are threatening to bring the prize into disrepute. 

<P>

Ms Kvanmo said however that "at the time, it was a correct decision" to honor Peres.

<P>

"He was the one of the three that really deserved the prize, because he took the initiative to the talks that led to the Oslo accords," she said.



<P>

Committee chairman Geir Lundestad voiced the concern of several members that if Mr Arafat were to be killed as a result of Israeli actions, one Nobel laureate might in effect be said to have killed the other.
