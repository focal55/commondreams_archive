<p>The United Nations dismissed as "not credible" yesterday an Israeli army claim 

that Palestinian gunmen fired from inside a UN compound in the West Bank city 

of Jenin on Friday before its soldiers shot dead Iain Hook, a 52-year-old British 

relief worker.</p>

by Israeli troops in the West Bank, as Israel pressed ahead with military operations 

it says aim to root out Palestinian suicide bombers. REUTERS<br>

</table></font>Paul McCann, a spokesman for the UN relief agency, said: "Our preliminary findings 

are completely contrary to what the Israeli army said. The compound is quite small. 

At no point did we lose control of the site. There were no militants on the site. 

I am very sad and angry that the man was shot dead while working in a clearly 

marked UN compound."</p>

<p>A security expert from UN headquarters in New York began immediately to investigate 

in greater depth how Mr Hook, who was heading a &#163;17m project to rebuild the 

Jenin refugee camp razed in an Israeli invasion in April, met his death. He was 

transferred last night to an Israeli forensic medicine laboratory near Tel Aviv, 

but UN officials were awaiting his family's decision on where to hold a post-mortem 

examination. Palestinians showed up in big numbers with flowers when the dead 

man was put into a UN ambulance for transfer to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The Israelis said Mr Hook was shot by a soldier who mistook a mobile phone 

he was holding for a grenade. They maintained that militants were firing from 

inside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency compound and from neighboring 

alleys, using civilians as defensive shields. In one case, the army said, a gunman 

shot from behind a woman carrying a blue flag of the agency.</p>

<p>The troops were on a search mission for a top Islamic Jihad operative, Abdullah 

Naji Wahash, when they came under fire. Israel blames Mr Wahash for plotting many 

bombings, including a suicide attack on a bus that killed 14 Israelis last month. 

He surrendered after the shooting abated.</p>

<p>Although Israel apologized for the "error", the shooting provoked a crisis 

in its relations with the UN and Britain. Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, demanded 

a full investigation. Mr Hook is the first foreign UN official to be killed since 

the Palestinian intifada broke out 26 months ago.</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the West Bank, Israeli troops yesterday barred worshippers from 

attending services in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. They reoccupied 

the city of Jesus Christ's birth on Thursday after a Hamas suicide bomber killed 

11 Israelis on a Jerusalem bus.</p>

<p>Thursday's bus bombing provoked a series of attacks by angry Jews against Arabs 

and their property in Jerusalem. Such reprisals have been surprisingly limited 

inside Israel after previous atrocities.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, dozens of Jewish youths stormed an Arab-owned bakery near 

the site of the bombing and caused heavy damage. Others had earlier tossed a firebomb 

into the building. The two owners, who were on the premises, escaped unhurt. Police 

arrested three Jewish suspects.</p>

<p>Other youths pelted an Arab car and attacked two female Arab students at the 

Hebrew University who were returning to their dormitory. Across Jerusalem, in 

the mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Abu Tor, vandals slashed the tires of 14 

cars owned by Palestinians.</p> </p>
