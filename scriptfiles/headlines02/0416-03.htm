WASHINGTON   - 

The Bush administration regrets its

hasty embrace of the short-lived coup against Venezuelan

President Hugo Chavez, experts in touch with U.S. officials

said on Tuesday.

<p>In public U.S. officials have shown no signs of remorse for

the position they took last Friday after the military forced

Chavez out of office and installed new civilian rulers.

<p>

The White House said Chavez, a frequent critic of U.S.

foreign policy, was responsible for his own fate because he had

ordered troops to open fire at unarmed demonstrators.

<p>

After Chavez returned to power on Sunday, U.S. officials

said they had spoken on Friday on the best information then

available, in the belief that Chavez had resigned.

<p>

But the experts, who have had private contacts with U.S.

officials this week, said the Bush administration now realized

their apparent sympathy for the coup was a mistake.

<p>

"Given my contacts with people in the administration over

the last two days -- they will not say so publicly -- but quite

clearly there has been a rethink of the decision last week at

the time of the coup," said Riordan Roett, director of the

Western Hemisphere program at the School of Advanced

International Studies in Washington.

<p>

"I have spoken to several people and they recognize the

damage. There is no question about that," said Larry Birns,

director of the liberal Council on Hemispheric Affairs.

<p>

The New York Times also made an unusual expression of

remorse in an editorial, saying that in welcoming the departure

of Chavez last week, it had "overlooked the undemocratic manner

in which he was removed."

<p>

"Forcibly unseating a democratically elected leader, no

matter how badly he has performed, is never something to

cheer," the editorial said.

<p>

LOSING MORAL LEADERSHIP

<p>

The administration's handling of the coup attempt has won

little support inside the United States, even at a time when

the attacks of Sept. 11 continue to give President Bush extra

leeway in conducting foreign policy.

<p>

Arturo Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin

American Studies and a former Clinton administration official,

said: "Unfortunately, the Bush administration did not seem to

understand what was at stake in Venezuela.

<p>

"The United States now risks losing much of the

considerable moral and political leadership it had rightly won

over the last decade as the nations of the Americas sought to

establish the fundamental principle that the problems of

democracy are solved in democracy."

<p>

Birns said the Bush administration was the primary loser

from the failed coup and had given ammunition to Latin

Americans who assume the United States has been behind every

coup in their region for decades.

<p>

The United States has denied it encouraged those

responsible for the coup, although U.S. officials had met

opponents of Chavez frequently in recent months.

<p>

"People have been coming to us complaining. We told them

that we support the democratic process and everything has to be

done constitutionally. We didn't so much as wink at them," said

a State Department official.

<p>

But Roett said the incident reinforced the impression among

Latin Americans that Bush does not take them seriously.

<p>

"He (Bush) can't get Congress to cooperate on trade

promotion authority. ... The FTAA (Free Trade Area of the

Americas) appears to be going nowhere.

<p>

"A series of issues have begin to raise some questions

about the commitment of the administration to the region. This

is one more step that will convince people who are skeptical

that there isn't much depth to the commitment," he added.
