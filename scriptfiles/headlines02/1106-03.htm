NATIONS - A U.N. special envoy expressed concern on Tuesday that a growing number 

of countries around the world were adopting post-Sept. 11 anti-terrorism strategies 

that threatened basic human rights.

<P> &quot;The list is growing every day,&quot; said Hina Jilani, the

special representative for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on

human rights defenders.<P> &quot;Threats to security must be eliminated through the rule of

law rather than outside it,&quot; she told a news conference after

briefing the 191-nation General Assembly.<P> The United States, Britain, Australia, Indonesia, Colombia

and Guatemala were among the countries that concerned her

because of anti-terrorism laws and actions taken after the

Sept. 11, 2001 attacks that killed about 3,000 people in the

United States, she said.<P> She also singled out Pakistan, where President Gen. Pervez

Musharraf gained power in a 1999 bloodless coup and has

recently moved to shore up his own considerable powers even as

his country held parliamentary elections last month.<P> &quot;Pakistan is in a very difficult situation right now, and

there is no reason to believe, either right now or in the very

near future, that there are good prospects for restoration of

democracy,&quot; Jilani said.<P> While anti-terror strategies varied from country to

country, some threatened human rights champions and their

families while others undermined independence movements,

asylum-seekers, political activists or opposition parties and

movements, she said.<P> In some countries, which she declined to name, &quot;it has been

very easy for governments to target the opposition by labeling

them as terrorists,&quot; she said.<P> &quot;In Africa, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in Asia

-- there is not a single region where countries are not fast

joining the rank of those who are adopting anti-terrorist

legislation,&quot; she said.<P> While she understood governments' need to protect their

citizens from terror attacks, &quot;I very firmly believe that the

imperatives of security will not be served by violating human

rights, and by undermining and derogating the standards that we

have already adopted,&quot; she said.
