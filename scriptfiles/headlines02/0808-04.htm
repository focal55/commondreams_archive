<p>Saudi Arabia announced yesterday it would veto the use of any of its territory 

for an attack on Iraq. The announcement is a severe blow to attempts by the United 

States and Britain to forge an international coalition against Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>The public opposition by the Saudis, traditionally seen as the West's staunchest 

Arab ally in the region, is the latest rebuff for George Bush and Tony Blair who 

have found themselves increasingly isolated by European and Middle Eastern states, 

as well as Russia and China.</p>

<p>The German Chancellor, Gerhard Schr&ouml;der also issued his strongest warning 

so far against an invasion of Iraq, saying it could "destroy the international 

alliance against terrorism".</p>

<p>Because of the Saudi reticence, the United States is now planning to use Qatar 

as its headquarters for the air campaign in any coming war. Work has been secretly 

under way for months to build up an air base there in case the Saudis refused 

permission, as they have.</p>

<p>The Al Udeid base, 20 miles from the Qatari capital, Doha, is now said to be 

almost ready, and squadrons of American and British warplanes are expected to 

arrive in the near future, according to defense sources.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia was the launchpad for Western forces in the Gulf War and played 

a crucial role in later actions against Iraq. The Prince Sultan air base is still 

used by American and British warplanes to patrol the southern "no-fly zone". But 

political and religious tension in the kingdom is now high amid a growing anti-Western 

feeling, fueled by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are also protests at 

the continuing presence of large groups of American forces in the land of Islam's 

holiest shrines.</p>

<p>Against that volatile backdrop, the kingdom also faces the likelihood of a 

power struggle within the House of Saud between conservatives and reformers because 

King Fahd is seriously ill in Geneva and may die.</p>

<p>The timing and the forthright nature of the statement, by Prince Saud al-Faisal, 

the Foreign Minister, is seen as highly significant. He said: "We are against 

any attack on Iraq because we believe it is not needed, especially now Iraq is 

moving to implement United Nations resolutions. For the government of Iraq, the 

leadership of Iraq, any change that happens there has to come from the Iraqi people."</p>

<p>Relations between the Saudis and Americans are at a low ebb. Colin Powell, 

the US Secretary of State, rang Prince Saud yesterday in a fence-mending exercise 

after it was revealed that a confidential Pentagon briefing had described Saudi 

Arabia as a funder of international terrorism, and the "kernel of evil and the 

most dangerous opponent" America faces in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The Bush administration meanwhile sent out conflicting messages. President 

Bush said he would be "patient" and consult Congress and the US's allies over 

Iraq, but Vice-President Dick Cheney stuck to the administration's hawkish stance 

by expressing skepticism about the value of the UN inspectors' return. Presidential 

aides later said it was not Mr Bush's intention to send a conciliatory message 

by promising to explore "all options and all tools at my disposal: diplomacy, 

international pressure, perhaps the military". US oil futures dipped because his 

remarks were taken as a sign that an offensive was some time away.</p>

<p>The confusion was echoed across the Atlantic, when Mike O'Brien, a Foreign 

Office minister, said war would be averted if Saddam Hussein readmitted arms inspectors. 

But that was at odds with Tony Blair who supports Mr Bush's policy of "regime 

change" in Baghdad.</p>

<p>If military action does begin, the Al Udeid base will play an important role. 

Defense sources say it has a 12,500ft runway, with hangars fortified against chemical 

and biological attacks, for up to 120 warplanes. The base has also been supplied 

with satellite links that enable the command center to co-ordinate air strikes 

and download reconnaissance footage from unmanned aircraft.</p>

<p>The US is expected to deploy F-16 and F-15E fighter bombers at the base, as 

well as unmanned Predators and Global Hawks. The British contribution is likely 

to consist of RAF Tornado strike aircraft, TriStar and VC-10s to provide air-to-air 

refueling, and AWACS, Nimrods and Canberras for reconnaissance. The Americans 

also have four warehouses with tanks and armour to equip a mechanized brigade 

at Al Udeid.</p>

<p>President Saddam is due to address his nation in a televised speech today as 

his government steps up efforts to avert a war.</p>
