<p>FRANKFURT, June 26 — It was not just WorldCom that took a beating today. It 

was also the United States itself, and the American gospel of how business should 

be done. </p>

</table>After years of pumping billions of dollars into the United States because 

it seemed the land of opportunity, foreign investors are pulling back. And people 

around the world who for decades have looked to the United States as the model 

for openness and accountability in business have been sorely disillusioned by 

the mounting waves of scandal. </p>

<P> "This is the most pessimistic sentiment against the United States that I have 

ever experienced in my career," said Wolfram Gerdes, chief investment officer 

for global equities at Dresdner Investment Trust in Frankfurt. "There is unanimous 

agreement that the U.S. is not the best place to invest anymore."</p>

<P> The immediate impact is discernible in the value of the dollar, which has 

been sliding since March. It fell today to its lowest level against the euro in 

28 months. The dollar has also fallen against the Japanese yen, and even gold 

has been rising steadily in dollar terms.</p>

<P> The loss of foreign confidence in the United States is important in itself, 

because of the huge deficit the United States runs in its trade with the world. 

To cover that deficit, America must attract a net inflow of $1.3 billion in foreign 

money every day. Even a modest decline in the flow can weaken the dollar and drive 

up the prices of imported goods. </p>

<P> But the fall from grace is broader than just a turn in the monetary tide. 

The more enduring impact of the accounting and boardroom scandals may be the tarnish 

they spread on the "American model," a philosophy that emphasizes bare-knuckle 

competition, aggressive deal making, a high level of public disclosure and fantastic 

rewards for executives who deliver the goods.</p>

<P> Europe has had its own run of financial scandals, generally involving young 

technology and media companies, that match the worst cases to surface during the 

dot-com bubble. But Guido Rossi, a former chairman of Telecom Italia and now one 

of Italy's most outspoken advocates for modernizing the way companies are run 

in Europe, said: "What is lacking in the U.S. is a culture of shame. No C.E.O. 

in the U.S. is considered a thief if he does something wrong. It is a kind of 

moral cancer." </p>

<P> There is a groundswell among executives in Europe against the American system 

of corporate accounting — the so-called generally accepted accounting principles 

— that was supposed to be the gold standard in disclosure.</p>

<P> Before Enron, Global Crossing and WorldCom, America had been winning the argument 

on accounting standards. But now, a growing number of Europeans are convinced 

that the American system is both too complex and too easy to manipulate. "We always 

thought it was too good to be true in America, and this has proved it," said Angela 

Knight, the chief executive of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers 

and Stock Brokers in Britain.</p>

<P> To be sure, American corporate practices in general remain at least as open 

and accountable as those in any other country, and they have raised the expectations 

that shareholders elsewhere have of their own companies. And most experts agree 

that the main problem is not with the principles themselves but with people who 

are determined to distort their companies' financial results. </p>

<P> European corporations like Vivendi Universal are reeling from shareholder 

wrath over their inscrutable finances and unsupportable debt. Deutsche Telekom, 

Germany's biggest telephone company, is for the second time in two years fighting 

off charges that it grossly overvalued billions of dollars worth of real estate 

before it went public six years ago.</p>

<P> In Germany, Italy and elsewhere, many of the biggest companies remain shielded 

from takeovers by byzantine cross-holdings and capital structures and by laws 

that arm entrenched management with a variety of defenses against their own shareholders.</p>

<P> Nor are Enron-like problems unknown elsewhere, as shareholders in HIH, a major 

Australian insurer, and Asia Pulp and Paper discovered last year when the companies 

plunged into default.</p>

<P> Indeed, advocates of improved corporate governance in countries like Japan 

say they only wish their companies were as accountable as those in the United 

States. The problem now, they say, is that the scandals in America will be used 

by opponents of openness and accountability to justify their intransigence.</p>

<P> "This has disappointed many people who tried to work to modernize themselves 

along the lines of the American model," said Haruo Shimada, a professor of economics 

at Keio University in Tokyo, who has pushed for freer markets in Japan and has 

been an adviser to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</p>

<P> In Russia, where corporate governance has all too frequently meant blatant 

theft and Machiavellian intrigue, corporate executives say the scandals prove 

that Russia is not so different from the United States after all.</p>

<P> "At a certain point, Americans began thinking that they were the ideal," said 

Anatoly M. Karachinsky, president of Information Business Systems, one of Russia's 

largest information-technology companies. "But there are no ideal laws."</p>

<P> The American model has put down roots around the world that are too deep to 

be uprooted entirely by the recent wave of scandals, especially in developing 

countries like India that have pushed hard to modernize in recent years. Executives 

there said that a decade ago, an Enron or WorldCom collapse might have tipped 

the policy argument against Westernization of the economy, but there is no turning 

back now.</p>

<P> What has happened instead, in India, Russia and elsewhere, is a painful loss 

of face for the consultants and accountants representing American companies. "The 

scandal has been unhelpful, especially since we, as a profession, operate on a 

reputation and the implicit trust that follows," said Gautam Dalal, chief executive 

of the Indian arm of KPMG.</p>

<P> In Western Europe, corporations have been gravitating toward American management 

principles for much of the last decade. They raise money on Wall Street, and a 

growing number now list their shares on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, 

obliging them to report their results according to American rules.</p>

<P> But those rules have also met growing resistance. The New York Stock Exchange 

recently invited Porsche to list its shares. Porsche will not make a decision 

until December, but its executives have openly balked at some of the requirements 

that would go with such a listing. Porsche refuses to publish its financial results 

quarterly, as American companies must, because executives worry about being held 

hostage to short-term pressures.</p>

<P> The American practice of executive enrichment is also coming under attack. 

Appalled at the tens of millions of dollars that executives at Enron and many 

other companies received through stock options, the chairman of Germany's biggest 

steel manufacturer cautioned his peers this week against following suit. "I warn 

people not to simply take over rules from the United States without first reflecting 

on them critically," said Gerhard Cromme of ThyssenKrupp. </p>

<P> German companies, led by Volkswagen, are adamantly fighting proposals by the 

European Commission that would make hostile takeovers easier. Advocates of the 

new rules say they would force companies to become more accountable to their shareholders, 

but German leaders say they would create an "unfair playing field." </p>

<P> European leaders are also pushing for greater acceptance of their auditing 

rules, known as the international accounting standards, as an alternative to American 

rules. The great virtue of the international accounting standards, which all European 

Union companies will have to adopt by 2005, is that it is a simple and fairly 

compact list of basic principles. The American system, by contrast, is made up 

of volumes and volumes of decisions reached over the years on the finest nuances 

and shadings of every issue. </p>

<P> European critics (and a growing number of Americans) say the American system 

permits companies to follow the letter of the law while violating its spirit — 

to "tick boxes rather than use sound judgment," said Peter Wyman, president of 

the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.</p>

<P> Whether the international standard wins out over the American standard or 

not, global investors are clearly anxious to see some kind of meaningful accounting 

reform before they plunge back into the United States. A survey this month by 

UBS Warburg and the Gallup Organization found that only 32 percent of European 

investors now rank the United States as the most attractive market in the world. 

</p>

<P> But investors do not have many other places to go. European economic growth 

is expected to remain slower than American growth for the foreseeable future, 

Japan remains moribund and other markets are seen as fraught with risks.</p>

<P> "The one major currency area that has been able to play the role of safe harbor 

is the American area," said Jürgen Müller, a senior economist at DaimlerChrysler. 

"Everybody in the world is staring at the U.S. economy. Everybody is waiting for 

the U.S. economy to boom again." </p>
