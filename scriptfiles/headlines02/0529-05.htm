<p> AUGUSTA, Maine (AP)   More than 200 candidates had qualified as

of Tuesday for public financing in advance of next month's

primaries for Maine legislative seats, nearly double the figure two

years ago.

<p>   The state Ethics Commission said it had certified 156 House of

Representatives candidates and 48 Senate candidates for public

campaign funding under Maine's Clean Election law.

<p>   The 204 party candidates do not include several unenrolled, or

independent, candidates who also have qualified. The total

certified as of Tuesday stood at about 210, according to Ethics

Commission figures.

<p>   The total approaches a doubling of the 115 candidates who

qualified for Clean Election funding before legislative primaries

in 2000, the first year for voter-approved public financing in

Maine.

<p>   Candidates qualify by agreeing to forego most private donations

and collecting $5 contributions from a fixed number of supporters.

<p>   The surge in certifications was greeted as a positive

development by the Maine Citizen Leadership Fund, which said the

increase will help to dry up the flow of private and special

interest money into legislative campaigns.

<p>   The effect will be to break a direct link between candidates and

special interest groups, said Doug Clopp of the MCLF in Portland.

<p>   Critics say public financing systems like Maine's don't keep

special interest money out of elections, but simply alter its path

to influence voters.

<p>   Publicly financed candidates who win their June 11 primaries are

also eligible to receive public funds for their November general

election campaigns.

<p>   Money to fund Clean Election candidates comes from a state

interest-bearing account that now stands at roughly $8 million.

Ethics Commission Executive Director William Hain said he expects

$2 million to $3 million to be spent on publicly funded candidates

during the 2002 election cycle, but the final figure could be

influenced by many factors.

<p>   Two years ago, 115 of the 374 legislative primary candidates

were certified for public financing. Nearly half of the senators

who were seated and a quarter of the House members had used public

funds. The Legislature has 186 seats.

<p>   The Citizen Leadership Fund predicts the percentages will

increase sharply when the next Legislature is seated in December,

perhaps to 75 percent of the Senate and half of the House, Clopp

said.

<p>   The numbers for this year's primary races remain subject to

change in the weeks and months ahead. While some publicly financed

candidates will lose their primaries or withdraw, more independents

could win certification.

<p>   In addition, candidates who replace those who withdraw from

races will get 30-day periods to earn Clean Election eligibility.

<p>   The 2002 elections are Maine's first in which gubernatorial

candidates can also seek public financing. Jim Libby, who faces a

Republican primary against Peter Cianchette, has won certification.

<p>   Jonathan Carter, who is unopposed in the Green party's primary

for governor, has also qualified.

<p>   Two independent candidates for governor, John Michael, a state

representative from Auburn, and John Jenkins of Lewiston, a former

Democratic state senator, are trying to meet a June 3 deadline to

meet qualifications for Clean funding.

<p>   Clean Election certification could make gubernatorial candidates

with primary and general election opponents eligible for more than

$1 million in funding.

<p>   Senate candidates can qualify for more than $52,000 in contested

general elections, and House candidates can qualify for nearly

$13,000 in contested general elections. Uncontested candidates get

smaller distributions in uncontested races.
