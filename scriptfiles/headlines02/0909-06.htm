<p>Canadian Deputy Prime Minister John Manley said his country will not support US military action against Iraq aimed at toppling its government.</p>

<p>"We have not signed on for the change-the-regime movement in Iraq," Manley said Sunday in an interview with CTV television.</p>

<p>"They would be going in without Canadian support, but I'm not so sure they would be going in alone," he added.</p>

<p>The comment came ahead of a US-Canadian working summit in Detroit, Michigan, where President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Jean Chretien were to discuss Monday the situation in Iraq and US charges that Baghdad poses a threat to the international community by secretly building up its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>The meeting is seen as part of the Bush administration's attempt to rally international support for its possible military campaign against Iraq. </p>

<p>But Manley said Canada was not "in the camp" with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and others "who say there should be a preemptive attack." </p>

<p>"We have said there should be, in order to consider this part of the war against terrorism, evidence that Iraq is somehow connected to al-Qaeda," said the deputy prime minister. </p>

<p>The international Islamic terror network al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, are blamed for the September 11 attacks on the United States, which left about 3,000 people dead.</p>
