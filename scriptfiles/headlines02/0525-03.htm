<p>A LIMITED nuclear war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir would kill at least three million people, scientists said yesterday. 

<P>Millions would die in the immediate blast and fire and from radiation. Others would suffer destroyed homes, lack of water and facilities and disease years later. 

<P>M. V. Ramana, of Princeton University in New Jersey, told <I>New Scientist</I> magazine: “It is imperative that the two countries do not go to war, however limited in scale. 

<P>Even the most local conflicts have the potential to escalate into a full-scale war, possibly nuclear.” 

<P>Mr Ramana and other nuclear researchers at the US university have estimated that if only a tenth of the nuclear weapons of the two countries were exploded above ten of their largest cities, 2.6 million people would die or be injured in India and 1.8 million in Pakistan. 

<P>Their calculations are based on what would happen if ten explosions, similar in size to the one over Hiroshima in Japan in 1945, took place over some of India’s and Pakistan’s most populated cities. 

<P>The targeted cities used in the scenario are Bangalore, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Delhi in India, and Faisalabad, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan. 

<P>Casualties on the Indian side would be 1.7 million dead and 900,000 injured, while the toll in Pakistan would be 1.2 million dead and 600,000 injured. 

<P>These would be, however, only the immediate casualties from blast, fire and radiation. An unknown number of deaths would occur from cancer in future years. 

<P>Radioactive dust, if the bombs exploded on the ground, would kill people across hundreds of square miles. Because the prevailing winds are from the west, India is a likelier victim of fallout than Pakistan. 

<P>Estimates of the countries’ nuclear arsenals are based on their stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium, according to <I>New Scientist</I>. 

<P>“The Institute for Science and International Security in Washington suggests that India has about 65 warheads made from 310 kilograms of plutonium, while Pakistan has about 40 made from 690 kilograms of uranium,” it said. But other estimates differ. 

<P>Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary, warned India and Pakistan yesterday that war was not an option because of the risk of escalation between the two nuclear armed states. 

<P>Mr Rumsfeld said that both countries, which have fought three wars and tested nuclear weapons in 1998, were capable of waging nuclear war but he said that the consequences would be devastating. 

<P>“It would be bad, it would not be pretty, it would be not short-lived,” he said. 

<P>Mr Rumsfeld said that message was delivered to India during US-Indian defense talks at the Pentagon on Thursday. 

<P>“We also expressed our country’s very serious concerns about the dangerous situation between India and Pakistan and the need to reduce tensions between the two countries,” he said. </P>
