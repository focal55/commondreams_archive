<p>The earth summit has been hijacked by big business and the original goals of 

enhancing the lives of the world's poor are fast disappearing, according to research 

by an aid agency seen by the Guardian. 

<P><a href="http://www.christian-aid.org.uk/" target="_new">Christian Aid</a> 

has launched a blistering attack on the business community in the lead-up to the 

world summit on sustainable development, which opens in Johannesburg on August 

26.

</table>Binding regulations on companies, covering such issues as human rights and 

the environment, have been dropped in favor of voluntary codes, its report says. 

The draft plan now calls only for the "promotion of corporate accountability and 

responsibility and the exchange of best practices". 

<P>It blames this on specially formed lobby groups including <a href="http://www.basd-action.net/" target="_new">Business 

Action for Sustainable Development</a> (BASD), supported by the <a href="http://www.wbcsd.ch/" target="_new">World 

Business Council for Sustainable Development</a> and the <a href="http://www.iccwbo.org/" target="_new">International 

Chamber of Commerce</a>. 

<P>"Business has greater access and influence than any other group and we are 

concerned that the agenda is being unduly skewed towards the wishlists of companies 

and away from those of the poor," the agency says. Its report concludes: "Ten 

years after the Rio earth summit, the Johannesburg summit offers the chance to 

place corporate accountability at the center of sustainable development. Corporate 

influence means this does not look like happening." 

<P>Business leaders last night said the summit was an intergovernmental conference 

and they had no more influence as observers than any other non-governmental organization.

<P>As for regulation of corporate accountability, BASD said: "It is up to individual 

governments to look at what is feasible, possible and desirable. NGOs have the 

best interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized companies at 

heart but they have not really thought through the consequences." 

<P>Tougher rules could set standards that many smaller firms could not meet, leading 

to decreased investment in developing countries. 

<P>But Christian Aid points to comments made by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, 

last September, who said: "We cannot leave companies to regulate themselves globally, 

any more than we do in our national economies." 

<P>The agency is not the only NGO to complain that the summit has come under the 

sway of big business. This week <a href="http://www.foei.org/" target="_new">Friends 

of the Earth</a> said a "creeping corporate takeover of the UN itself" was under 

way. 

<P>Meanwhile, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said yesterday he was 

delighted to have been picked as part of the five-strong ministerial team to attend 

the summit, after Downing Street announced it had reinstated him in the British 

delegation. 

<P>Mr Meacher had been dropped on the instructions of Tony Blair, who was concerned 

Britain was taking too many ministers in a delegation of 100 to what will be the 

world's biggest conference. 

<P>After the Guardian reported that Mr Meacher had been excluded, enraged environmental 

groups offered to pay his fare and hotel bill so Britain could be represented 

by the only minister they think fully understands the issues. 

<P>"Of course I am delighted to be going," Mr Meacher said. "Now we have settled 

the delegation I hope we can concentrate on the issues involved. I believe &#91;these 

are&#93; pushing forward the agenda on energy, water, health, food security and 

biodiversity to make the world better for the poor and underdeveloped countries."
