MEXICO CITY -- The Bush administration's rapid initial approval of this month's 

coup in Venezuela has tarnished its status as self-proclaimed champion of democracy 

and the rule of law in Latin America.

<p>Moreover, the reaction to the attempted ouster of President Hugo Chavez especially 

rankled Latin leaders because it followed recent trade and security measures in 

which the U.S. has been seen as contradicting its principles.

<p>The practical effects could include an erosion in support for U.S. policies 

on Iraq and the Middle East conflict, Latin American diplomats say. To be sure, 

there is little sympathy in the region for Chavez, who has trampled on a few democratic 

principles himself. But by seemingly backing the overthrow of a freely elected 

leader, the United States has diminished its capacity for moral suasion.

<p>"There is at least a short-term cost. It's not something people will forget," 

said Carlos Elizondo Mayer-Serra, a political scientist and director of the Mexico 

City-based Center for Economic Research and Teaching. "It's a displacement of 

the very ends that the United States is trying to promote."

<p>After Chavez was replaced April 12, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer 

declared the Bush administration's support for new elections. And National Security 

Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on a television news show two days later that Chavez's 

policies were not working for his country. But the administration has insisted 

that it took no action to encourage a coup or ensure its success.

<p>Response Draws Fire

<p>For all the administration's talk of backing democracies and free markets, 

its response gave the impression that the U.S. government selectively supports 

coups d'etat and a short-circuiting of the popular will, various observers in 

the hemisphere say.

<p>A leading Brazilian newspaper, O Globo, said, "Washington's impatience, its 

supposed approval of the coup leaders and its hurry to approve an interim government 

bring back memories of a past that democracies of the continent repudiate with 

fervor."

<p>Most Latin American leaders--led by the presidents of Mexico, Brazil and Argentina--were 

quick to condemn the coup attempt. Upon his return to office, Chavez singled out 

Mexico's Vicente Fox by thanking him for refusing to recognize the coup leaders.

<p>The Brazilian government reacted "with pleasure to Venezuela's return to constitutional 

order and its democratic process. . . . It marks an important achievement in the 

reaffirmation of Latin American values and democratic principles."

<p>By contrast, President Ricardo Lagos of Chile is under fire at home for his 

seemingly ambivalent initial response to the news. Lagos' fellow leftists say 

Chilean leaders have a special responsibility to denounce coup attempts, given 

the violent 1973 overthrow of President Salvador Allende.

<p>But it was the U.S. reaction that had immediate repercussions at the United 

Nations, with Latin American diplomats holding a private conclave and the large 

developing-nation bloc uniting quickly behind Chavez and, by implicit extension, 

against Washington.

<p>The consensus, participants said, was that the coup plotters had acted only 

because they believed--rightly or not--that they had been given a green light 

by the Bush administration.

<p>"The United States blew it badly," said a senior Latin American diplomat at 

the U.N. from a country that is normally supportive of Washington. "It is now 

trying to get out of this situation the best that it can. But damage has definitely 

been done."

<p>U.S. Actions a Concern

<p>The Venezuelan fiasco occurred amid lingering bitterness in the region after 

the U.S. slapped tariffs of up to 30% on foreign steel this year. That measure 

in effect seals off the U.S. market from exporters such as Brazil, which says 

the tariff runs counter to free trade principles.

<p>U.S. law enforcement agencies' roundup of hundreds of foreigners after Sept. 

11 and the secrecy surrounding their detention also concern many Latin Americans 

for what the actions convey about legal institutions that heretofore were regarded 

as exemplary.

<p>"Some of the measures have been more appropriate to a dictatorship, and so 

I hope they are only temporary," said Diego Valades, director of the Center for 

Juridical Studies at Mexico's National Autonomous University.

<p>In Mexico, Fox is under fire for forging stronger U.S. links. It doesn't help 

that his quest for legal status for about 3 million undocumented immigrants in 

the United States is stalled.

<p>Elsewhere, there is exasperation in Argentina over U.S. reluctance to approve 

a financial assistance package to help the Latin nation out of its economic crisis.

<p>Seeking to mend diplomatic fences after a difficult week in the region for 

the United States, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell assured the representatives 

of the Organization of American States at a meeting Thursday in Washington that 

the administration stands with critics of the failed coup.

<p>That effort was undercut, however, by U.S. efforts to water down the initial 

OAS resolution to repudiate Chavez's attempted ouster.

<p>"We condemn the blows to constitutional order that Venezuela has suffered," 

Powell told the gathering. "We look to the legal authorities of Venezuela to hold 

accountable all who violated the law both before and during the recent crisis."

<p>In a reference to the shaky history of democratic regimes in Latin America, 

Powell said: "Coups are a thing of the past, not a pathway to the future."

<p>He also acknowledged that the coup raised the question of how vigorously other 

countries, including the United States, had acted in support of Venezuelan democracy. 

And he said words that Latin leaders wanted to hear--that democratic processes 

must be observed.

<p>"We must do this not just for Venezuela's sake but for all our sakes," he said, 

"because the consolidation of democracy in our hemisphere is profoundly important 

to all of us--to our freedom, to our prosperity and to our security."

<p>Some U.S. analysts say the administration's handling of the coup attempt was 

a diplomatic setback but will probably not have lasting effects on its influence 

in the region.

<p>But others say it raised questions about the competence of the Bush team dealing 

with Latin America.

<p>Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 

Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said the episode showed that the administration 

needs more "adult supervision."
