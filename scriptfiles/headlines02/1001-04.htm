<p>Tens of thousands of unionists belonging to South Africa's largest labor federation 

were marching against the government's economic policies, which it blamed for 

job losses in the country.</p>

<p>The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), with its claimed 1.7 million-strong 

membership is mounting a two-day strike, with mass marches Tuesday and a stayaway 

on Wednesday, which it hoped would influence government to put a moratorium on 

privatization.</p>

<p>In Johannesburg, police estimated some 25,000 COSATU members marched through the city to two parastatals, electricity supplier Eskom and rail utility Spoornet.</p>

<p>The African National Congress-led government wants to sell at least parts of 

these assets, a move criticized by COSATU and the South African Communist Party 

(SACP), alliance partners of the ANC, which said it would cause the further loss 

of jobs.</p>

<p>Watched by a contingent of police, which included at least two armored cars, 

the protesters -- many dressed in red union T-shirts -- gathered at Beyers Naude 

Square, in the city center.</p>

<p>They carried placards and banners saying: "Privatized services won't serve 

the poor" and "Away with the maize meal high prices".</p>

<p>One of the protestors said she was angry because she had not seen any change since democratic elections in 1994.</p>

<p>"There's no food, no money, no jobs, nothing," unionist Poppie Mhlambe told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's the government's fault. I voted for the ANC before but I will never vote for them again," she said.</p>

<p>In the capital Pretoria, some 2,000 COSATU members marched to hand a memorandum 

to Reserve bank governor Tito Mboweni, while in Cape Town, the same number were 

converging on parliament.</p>
