<p>AUGUSTA, Maine -- Organizers of an anti-war protest at the Maine capitol complex 

Saturday said their effort to bring together various opponents of military action 

against Iraq demonstrated by itself the possibilities of negotiation. 

<p> ''These people had differences,'' said Greg Field, executive director of <a href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/">Peace 

Action Maine</a>, gesturing toward a rain-drenched crowd variously estimated to 

include 1,000 to 3,000 people.

</table></font></font>Signs bobbing above umbrellas carried a broad array of messages,

ranging from ''Diplomacy not War'' to ''War is Terrorism.''

<p>   Some marchers departed soon after reaching the capitol without

staying for the rally, making estimates of the number of

participants highly uncertain.

<p>   Field said a unifying theme was the desirability of nations

agreeing to ''work through the U.N.'' and that protesters shared a

belief that unilateral military action was unwarranted.

<p>   ''A pre-emptive strike is wrong,'' he said. ''There is not an

imminent threat.''

<p>   After marching to the State House from a nearby school,

demonstrators gathered near a statue of Samantha Smith, the Maine

schoolgirl who was internationally known for her advocacy of peace.

<p>   Joining intermittently in songs performed by a string of

musicians, protesters applauded anti-war speeches.

<p>   ''I think the overarching issue is the war,'' said Veterans for

Peace activist Dud Hendrick, adding that an additional concern of

demonstrators was ''the endless war on terrorism.''

<p>   The Augusta rally coincided with similar gatherings elsewhere in

the state, around the nation and overseas.

<p>   Organizers were exultant at the size of the crowd and Field said

he was sure the turnout had been held down by the inclement weather

because some planning to attend had notified others they had

changed their minds.</p>
