NEW DELHI, January 3   -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari 

Vajpayee on Wednesday said that all military options were open in India's war 

against terrorism, the Hindu newspaper reported Thursday. 

<P>Addressing a rally in Lucknow of India's north state of Uttar Pradesh, 

Vajpayee said that no weapon would be spared in self-defense. Whatever weapon 

was available, it would be used no matter how it wounded the enemy, he said. 

India was a worshipper of peacebut if the situation demanded, it was always 

ready to fight, the prime minister stressed. 

<P>The attack on Parliament was not only an attack on a building made of 

cement and mortar, but an attack on the heart of India, Vajpayee said, adding 

this kind of an attack was different from killing a few persons. 

<P>The prime minister recalled that when India conducted nuclear tests there 

was adverse reaction from other countries. But he affirmed that in self-defense 

no weapon would be spared, saying while India wanted peace, it was capable of 

being fierce, if needed. It was time it gave a reply to Pakistan, he was quoted 

as stating. 

<P>Rejecting Pakistan's demand for proof against terrorist organizations 

functioning from its territory, he asked, "Why was it that the terrorists came 

from Pakistan? Whose hand was behind the terrorist attack on the Indian 

Parliament?" He said it was strange that the same people were demanding proof. 

Even documents recovered from the slain terrorists proved their links with 

Pakistan, he noted. 

<P>The Indian Prime Minister said that Pakistan had no alternative but to fight 

terrorism. Since it was part of the international community which was fighting a 

war against terrorism, it must take the steps which the international community 

had taken, he said.</p>
