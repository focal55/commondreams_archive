</table></font>A huge pall of smoke rose from the compound in Ramallah as a series of explosions rocked the area.

<P> Latest reports say an armoured bulldozer is digging a trench around Mr Arafat's 

office building.

<P>

One of the demolished buildings is thought to be directly behind where Mr Arafat is currently located. 

<P>

But the Associated Press quotes one of his aides as saying he remains in good spirits.

<P>

The army has blown up or bulldozed more than 10 structures in the compound, already battered by previous incursions that followed Palestinian attacks in Israel, Reuters news agency said. 

<P>

There has been no immediate comment from the Israeli military, whose tanks have been surrounding the compound since late on Thursday.

	</table></font>The BBC's Barbara Plett in Ramallah says the Israelis are levelling the compound 

around the Palestinian leader, aiming to isolate him completely. 

<P> They accuse him of failing to rein in Palestinian militants involved in this 

week's suicide bombings inside Israel. 

<P> During the night, about 20 Palestinians left the compound and surrendered 

to the Israelis. 

<P> However, the army is demanding the surrender of other key figures - including 

the head of West Bank intelligence - they believe to be inside. 

<P> Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat appealed to the international community 

to take action to end the Israeli "aggression", particularly against Mr Arafat. 

<P> In comments to the French news agency, AFP, Mr Erekat said the siege was part 

of a plan by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to destroy the peace process. 

<P> However, Israeli Defence Minister Binyamin Bin-Eliezer told army radio that 

Israel had "no intention" of firing at Mr Arafat or expelling him from the West 

Bank. 

<P> Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has said the cycle of violence in the Middle 

East "will never diminish unless the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are 

achieved." 

<P> The Palestinians faced a "human catastrophe" because of Israeli policies of 

siege, starvation, military incursions and destruction of property, Foreign Minister 

Saud al-Faisal told the UN General Assembly late on Thursday. 

<P> For much of the past year, the Palestinian leader has been confined in Ramallah, 

with most of his compound destroyed and his security forces decimated. 

<P><B>Helicopter fire</B> 

<P> The Ramallah siege coincided with two Israeli army incursions into the Gaza 

Strip, with one group advancing to the edge of Gaza City and another penetrating 

two kilometres (one mile) near the towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanun. 

<P> Witnesses in Gaza City saw tanks and helicopters fire into the densely populated 

Shijaia district. 

<P> Two Palestinians - a man and a woman - were killed by the Israeli fire. Witnesses 

said that troops blew up several metal workshops in Gaza. 

<P> Thursday's bombing in Tel Aviv was the second in two days - the first fatal 

suicide attacks in Israel for six weeks. 

<P> A Palestinian bomber blew himself up on a crowded bus in Allenby street, instantly 

killing five people and injuring about 50 others. 

<P> One of the wounded - a young man from Scotland - has since died of his injuries. 

<P><B>'Cruel terrorism'</B> 

<P>Israel's cabinet met for a full emergency session for the first time in six 

months on Thursday night and decided to "isolate" Mr Arafat. 

<P> But the question of expelling the Palestinian leader was apparently dropped 

on the grounds that it would do Israel more harm than good. 

<P> The wanted Palestinians inside Mr Arafat's compound are accused of mounting 

attacks on Israelis. 

<P> They include the head of West Bank intelligence, Tawfiq Tirawi, accused by 

Israel of involvement in terrorist activities, and Mahmud Damra, the leader of 

Mr Arafat's Force 17 bodyguard. 

<P> Israeli sources are talking about an unlimited stay for the military. 

<P> They have tightened the curfew in Ramallah and other West Bank towns.
