<p>Pakistan, a key US ally in the war against terror, has been named as a major 

supplier of equipment for North Korea's secret program to develop nuclear weapons, 

whose disclosure this week stunned the Bush administration.</p>

<p>The charge was hotly denied yesterday in Islamabad, where General Hamid Gul 

a former head of Pakistan's powerful Inter Services Intelligence service, insisted 

there had been no exchange of his country's nuclear technology for North Korean 

missiles. "North Korea's technology has always been ahead of ours," he said. He 

claimed China and Russia were the suppliers. "We are no position to help them." 

But the Russian Foreign Ministry also denied any part in the Korean program</p>

<p>Whatever the truth &#150; and US intelligence officials are confident Pakistan, 

Russia and China are involved &#150; the episode illustrates the ambiguities and 

contradictions enveloping Washington's attempts to widen the war against terrorism 

to Iraq, and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p><i>The New York Times </i>said the equipment may have included the gas centrifuges 

needed to create weapons-grade enriched uranium (the same technology secretly 

used by Iraq before the Gulf War). It appeared to have been part of a barter deal 

in the late Nineties, trading Korean missiles to bolster Pakistan's defenses against 

India, for nuclear technology.</p>

<p>If so, a mystery which baffled Clinton administration officials &#150; of how 

a near-broke Pakistan found the hard currency for North Korean missile technology 

&#150; would be solved. But the answer only raises other, even more troubling 

questions.</p>

<p>Pakistan was closer than any other country to the fallen Taliban regime in 

Afghanistan. That uncomfortable fact, and the undemocratic rule of General Pervez 

Musharraf, have been ignored by the US, to secure Islamabad's co-operation in 

rooting out remnants of al-Qa'ida and other Islamic groups now based in Pakistan.</p>

<p>But it has been supplying the tools which qualify North Korea for its membership 

of President George Bush's "axis of evil". The revelation that Pyongyang probably 

has nuclear weapons is forcing the administration to rely on diplomatic means 

to persuade the North to abandon them, in contrast to the saber-rattling against 

Iraq which is generally conceded to represent no immediate nuclear threat.</p>

<p>This week, John Bolton, the Under Secretary of State, and Assistant Secretary 

of State James Kelly have been in Beijing, trying to persuade China, which is 

reckoned to have the closest ties to North Korea, to exert pressure on the reclusive 

regime of Kim Jong Il.</p>

<p>North Korea also will dominate next week's talks between Mr Bush and the Chinese 

leader, Jiang Zemin, at the President's ranch in Texas. Mr Bush had intended to 

try to line up Chinese support for the toughest possible United Nations resolution 

on Iraq. Now Mr Bush will have to discuss damage control on North Korea, and prevent 

this arms-control crisis from interfering with his strategy against Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>The White House insists the cases are not comparable. "Effective international 

pressure may have an effect on North Korea," Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's national 

security adviser, said. "Saddam Hussein is in a category by himself."</p> <p></p>
