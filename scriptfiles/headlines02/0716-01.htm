<p>As part of the country&#39;s war against terrorism, the Bush administration 

by next month wants to recruit a million letter carriers, utility workers and 

others whose jobs allow them access to private homes into a contingent of organized 

government informants. 

<p> The Terrorism Information and Prevention System (Operation TIPS), a national 

reporting pilot program, is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 

million informants — or nearly 4 percent of Americans — initially participating 

in the program. 

<p> The program will allow volunteers, whose routines make them well-positioned 

to recognize suspect activities, to report the same to the Justice Department, 

which is running the project. The Justice Department will enter the information 

into a database, which will then be broadly available within the department, and 

to state and local agencies and local police forces. At local and state levels, 

the program will be coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

<p> Operation TIPS is one part of President Bush&#39;s new volunteer Citizen Corps 

program that urges Americans to keep their neighborhoods safe. The program is 

described on the government Web site <a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/tips.html" target="_new">www.citizencorps.gov</a>.

<p> &#34;This broad network of volunteer efforts will harness the power of the 

American people by relying on their individual skills and interests to prepare 

local communities to effectively prevent and respond to the threats of terrorism, 

crime, or any kind of disaster,&#34; the program&#39;s description on the Web 

site states. 

<p> The program has already alarmed several civil liberties groups, including 

the American Civil Liberties Union and the Rutherford Institute, which say the 

administration should not allow TIPS to become &#34;an end run around the Constitution.&#34;

<p> Critics say that having Americans act as &#34;domestic informants&#34; is 

reminiscent of the infamous Stasi, the new-disbanded communist East German secret 

police service that snooped on dissidents and ordinary East German citizens for 

more than 40 years, compiling a huge catalogue of notes.

<p> Rachel King, an ACLU legislative counsel, said yesterday the organization 

is concerned that law enforcement will use the volunteers, especially those whose 

occupations allow them to enter homes and monitor residents — to search people&#39;s 

residences, without a warrant. She said that the organization is also worried 

that the program will adversely affect the fight against terrorism by wasting 

resources on useless tips and that the program will encourage vigilantism and 

racial profiling.

<p> &#34;The administration apparently wants to implement a program that will 

turn local cable or gas or electrical technicians into government-sanctioned peeping 

Toms,&#34; Miss King said. 

<p> John Whitehead, executive director of the Rutherford Institute, agreed.

<p> &#34;This is George Orwell&#39;s &#39;1984.&#39; It&#39;s an absolutely horrible 

and very dangerous idea,&#34; he said. &#34;It&#39;s making Americans into government 

snoops. President Bush wants the average American to do what the FBI should be 

doing. In the end, though, nothing is going to prevent terrorists from crashing 

planes into buildings.&#34;

<p> A Justice Department official in charge of answering questions about Operation 

TIPS was out of the office yesterday and not available for comment.</p>
