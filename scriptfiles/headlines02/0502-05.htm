<p> WASHINGTON   - 

More than half of all Americans

breathe polluted air that can damage their health because the

government doesn't fully enforce clean air laws, the American

Lung Association said on Wednesday.

<p>



Standards are in place to cut back pollution, but since

they are not being enforced, nearly 400 counties in the United

States have smog levels above the legal limits, the group said.

<p>

"It is clearly time to get serious about enforcing all of

the provisions of the Clean Air Act so that we place Americans'

health above business and political interests," said

John Kirkwood, president and chief executive officer of the

American Lung Association.

<p>

Kirkwood said industry was fighting to roll back

important provisions of the Clean Air Act, and ozone standards

set in 1997 are still not being enforced.

<p>

"More protective ozone standards effectively have been on

hold due to challenges by industry, which have kept states

relying on weaker standards they have used since 1979," Kirkwood

said.

<p>

Ozone has been linked with poor air quality, smog, asthma

and other respiratory conditions.

<p>

A coalition of business groups, led by the American

Trucking Association, filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the

Environmental Protection Agency's 1997 pollution standards

saying they were arbitrary and had no scientific basis.

<p>

But last month, the US Court of Appeals for the District of

Columbia Circuit rejected the argument, saying the EPA "must err

on the side of caution" and set pollution standards at "whatever

level it deems necessary and sufficient to protect the public

health."

<p>

Other legal issues also are still unresolved concerning

the pollution standards--which the EPA estimates would prevent

15,000 premature deaths, 350,000 cases of asthma and 1 million

cases of decreased lung function in children.

<p>

"Somehow, industry believes it needs to continue to

pollute," Kirkwood said. "They have fought every step we have

taken toward cleaner air for all Americans. Now is the time for

EPA to act."

<p>

According to the association's report, the 10 most polluted

areas were Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange County in southern

California; Bakersfield, Fresno, Visalia, Tulare and

Porterville, California; Houston, Galveston and Brazoria, Texas;

Atlanta; Merced, California; Knoxville, Tennessee; Charlotte,

North Carolina, and neighboring Rockville, South Carolina, and

Sacramento, California.

<p>

The cleanest big cities included Bellingham, Washington;

Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
