WASHINGTON  - 

The White House apparently changed a

draft energy proposal circulated by the State Department last

year to add a provision aimed at helping energy-trader Enron

Corp. in India, a Democratic lawmaker says.

<p>

Rep. Henry Waxman of California wrote Friday to Vice

President Dick Cheney, who headed the administration's energy

policy task force, to point out the change.

<p>



 A week ago Waxman said he had found 17 policies in the

White House's May 2001 energy plan, including the India

provision, that were either advocated by Enron or benefited

Enron.

<p>



 He said in his letter to Cheney on Friday that it now

appeared the India provision had been missing from the draft

energy policy proposal circulated by the State Department

during an interagency review in March 2001.

<p>



 "Instead, the provision appears to have been added to the

plan during the period in which the White House directly

controlled the drafting," Waxman wrote.

<p>



 The White House has strongly denied that its energy plan

was crafted to help Enron, President Bush's biggest political

patron, and has sought to keep the financial scandal around the

now-collapsed energy trader from spreading to the Bush

administration.

<p>



 The added provision recommended that the U.S. secretaries

of state and energy help India maximize its domestic oil and

gas production, Waxman said.

<p>



 "The energy plan does not discuss this recommendation or

explain why maximizing oil and gas production in India should

be a U.S. national energy priority," Waxman said in his letter

to Cheney, a copy of which was provided to Reuters.

<p>



 But he asserted that the recommendation "benefited Enron by

formally enlisting two Cabinet secretaries in Enron's conflict

with the Indian government."

<p>



 Enron's &#36;2.9 billion gas-fired power plant and adjacent

liquefied natural gas facility at Dabhol, about 155 miles (250

km) south of Bombay, has been idle since last June due to a

tariff dispute with the government.

<p>



 Last week the White House acknowledged that the

administration had intervened with Indian officials last year

in a bid to salvage the Dabhol plant, and also noted that

former President Clinton's commerce secretaries had made

similar appeals on behalf of Dabhol.

<p>



 But the White House has rebuffed calls by Waxman and other

lawmakers for the energy task force's records. On Friday the

head of the Congress' auditing arm, the General Accounting

Office, said he would decide within days whether to take the

administration to court to try to get the records.
