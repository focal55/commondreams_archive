<p> The American Civil Liberties Union plans to announce today a $2.5 million 

media campaign aimed at the aggressive anti-terrorism policies of the Bush administration 

and Attorney General John D. Ashcroft -- the largest such effort in its 80-year 

history.</p>

<p>Dubbed the "Campaign to Defend the Constitution," it will include rallies, 

legislative lobbying and television ads on major networks in New York, Los Angeles, 

Washington and other markets, the group said.</p>

<p>The campaign, launched shortly before the Nov. 5 elections, appears to be the 

first concerted public relations effort by critics of the administration's anti-terrorism 

tactics. The small coalition of groups opposed to the government's anti-terror 

tactics has focused primarily on the courts.</p>

<p>"We perceive a real need to reach out to the American public and inspire discussion 

and debate on these issues," said Anthony D. Romero, ACLU executive director. 

"This campaign is really a response to the statements of John Ashcroft and the 

policies of John Ashcroft's Justice Department."</p>

<p>Civil liberties advocates and liberal critics have protested guidelines issued 

by Ashcroft after Sept. 11, 2001, that give authorities broad new powers to conduct 

surveillance in domestic terror probes. Critics have also objected to the investigations 

and detentions of foreign nationals that have occurred in almost complete secrecy.</p>

<p>Ashcroft and President Bush have defended the tactics as lawful and necessary 

to help prevent future terrorist attacks. "Our critics seem to think that business 

as usual . . . would keep America safe from terrorists," Ashcroft said in recent 

remarks. "History instructs us that caution and complacency are not defenses of 

freedom."</p>

<p> While they acknowledge that Ashcroft's policies have not met with major opposition, 

ACLU officials say they believe that, more than a year after the attacks on New 

York and Washington, the tide of public opinion is turning.</p>

<p> "We have to balance the need for safety with the need to protect our freedoms," 

Romero said.</p>
