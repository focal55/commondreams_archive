PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil -- A day before the World Social Forum draws to a close here, 

the debate raged, with protesters demonstrating against the Free Trade Area of 

the Americas (ALCA) and representatives from some 150 countries urging nations 

to promote peace and social justice.

</font>Participants at the World Social Forum released a document calling for 

"resistance toward neoliberalism and militarism and support for peace and social 

justice."

<p>"September 11 marked a dramatic change," the document said, condemning the 

terrorist attacks on the United States which killed more than 3,000 people while 

also denouncing the "massive" military operation the United States and its allies 

launched in response to the strikes.</p>

<p>"In the name of the war against terrorism, civil and political rights have 

been attacked throughout the world," the text said.</p>

<p>"The war against Afghanistan has been extended into other areas. It is starting 

a permanent global war to strengthen the domination of the US government and its 

allies," the document warned.</p>

<p>It also charged that "the neoliberal promise of growth and prosperity is a 

lie" and declared the foreign debt of developing countries "illegitimate" and 

"unjust."</p>

<p>The final version of the text will be approved on Tuesday, before the forum 

draws to a close, Carlos Frape of the group ATTAC Espana told AFP.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thousands of people from rural workers movements and other groups 

marched here late Monday to protest the Free Trade Area of the Americas.</p>

<p>Antiglobalization activists held another demonstration on Thursday to open 

the six-day forum, created last year as an alternative to the World Economic Forum 

of economic luminaries, held this year in New York.</p>

<p>The New York forum has been informally dubbed Davos-on-the-Hudson, as it is 

being held outside Davos, Switzerland, for the first time in its 32-year history.</p>

<p>Exchanging the first direct dialogue with its opponent event in New York, Brazilian 

representative there Candido Grzybowski told Forum director Andre Schneider that 

the Brazilian event had racked up three times the support of last year.</p>

<p>In a debate on Swiss television Grzybowski declared: "This year, it's New York-Davos 

which must pay attention to us.</p>

<p>"Last year, we found a need for the Social Forum to mark the birth of a major 

movement, and our idea was more promising than we thought. The 60,000 people who 

are there prove that. It is the greatest proof that we want a different world, 

on a grand scale."</p>

<p>But in New York, Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo called for way to bridge 

the gap between the two forums. "The world is waiting today for the industrialized 

nations to build a bridge with the forum in Porto Alegre," he told the World Economic 

Forum.</p>

<p>The World Social Forum, meanwhile, will close noon Tuesday after worlds from 

Portuguese Nobel peace prize winner Jose Saramago, followed by a touch unlikely 

to be seen in New York, as a samba school brings in the Carnival spirit with a 

singing-dancing finale.</p>
