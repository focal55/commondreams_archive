</table></font>Five foreign activists were injured on Monday during a demonstration against Israel's military presence near Jerusalem.



<FONT FACE="sans-serif" SIZE="2">

<P>



As the Israeli army tightens the ring around Palestinian leaders, it has ordered activists to keep out of its way.



<P>



Three French activists arrested along with Mr Bove arrived back in Paris on Monday evening after being expelled from Israel.



<P>



Mr Bove himself was being held with French colleagues at a detention centre at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport and, according to one report, is due to be put on a Turkish Airlines flight on Tuesday.

<B>'Unbearable to behold'</B>



<P>



The veteran campaigner, who has backed political causes as far away as Mexico, said he had seen some "unbearable" sights in recent days, especially at a detention centre for Palestinians where he was held briefly .



<P>



"There we saw hundreds of men sitting on the ground, under canvas and behind barbed wire, surveyed by watchtowers," he said.



<P>



"We saw 300 people kneeling down and blindfolded, waiting to be interrogated in the cold and the night. It was unbearable to behold."

<P>On Monday, a crowd of 100 foreign, mainly European, protesters confronted Israeli tanks at Beit Jala, near Bethlehem.



<P>



Eyewitnesses said that an Israeli machine-gunner fired a burst at the ground as they approached the armour and five activists were injured along with a Palestinian cameraman.



<P>



None were seriously injured although one British woman received a live bullet in her abdomen.
