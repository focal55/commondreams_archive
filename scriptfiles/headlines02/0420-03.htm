The head of the international scientific panel on climate change, which has called 

for urgent action to curb global warming, was deposed yesterday after a campaign 

by the Bush administration, Exxon-Mobil and other energy companies to get him 

replaced.

At a plenary session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 

Geneva, Robert Watson, a British-born US atmospheric scientist who has been its 

chairman since 1996, was replaced by an Indian railway engineer and environmentalist, 

R K Pachauri. 

<P>Dr Pachauri received 76 votes to DR Watson's 49 after a behind-the-scenes diplomatic 

campaign by the US to persuade developing countries to vote against DR Watson, 

according to diplomats. The British delegation argued for DR Watson and DR Pachauri 

to share the chairmanship. 

<P>The US campaign came to light after the disclosure of a confidential memorandum 

from the world's biggest oil company, Exxon-Mobil, to the White House, proposing 

a strategy for his removal. 

<P>This included the removal of President Bill Clinton's appointees on the US 

delegation, and their replacement by officials more sympathetic to the needs of 

industry. 

<P>Steve Sawyer, a Greenpeace climate change specialist, said: "Even the most 

cynical would be shocked by the heavy-handed tactics of the US delegation's bald 

display of their fossil fuel- backed politics." 

<P>Diplomats in Washington confirmed that the US had pursued an active campaign 

against DR Watson. 

<P>Although he comes from an industrial background, DR Pachauri is one of India's 

leading environmentalists and has supported implementation of the Kyoto treaty 

on global warming - a treaty the Bush administration has rejected. 

<P>Environmentalists argued that the anti-Watson campaign was a show of strength 

by the US, oil producers like Saudi Arabia, and oil corporations like Exxon-Mobil, 

intended to cow the IPCC. 

<P>However, the head of the US delegation to the IPCC, Harlan Watson, denied claims 

of a vendetta and said that DR Pachauri was both well qualified and the first 

strong candidate put forward by the developing world.</p>
