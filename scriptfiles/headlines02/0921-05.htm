<p>Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said President Bush’s plans to invade Iraq are 

a conscious effort to distract public attention from growing problems at home.</p>

<p>“This administration, all of a sudden, wants to go to war with Iraq,” Byrd 

said. “The [political] polls are dropping, the domestic situation has problems.... 

So all of a sudden we have this war talk, war fervor, the bugles of war, drums 

of war, clouds of war.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me that things suddenly went wrong. Back in August, the president 

had no plans.... Then all of a sudden this country is going to war,” Byrd told 

the Senate on Friday.</p>

<p>“Are politicians talking about the domestic situation, the stock market, weaknesses 

in the economy, jobs that are being lost, housing problems? No.”</p>

<p>Byrd warned of another Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Passed on Aug. 7, 1964, that 

resolution handed President Lyndon Johnson broad powers to escalate the war in 

Vietnam, a conflict that cost 58,202 American lives and millions of Asian lives.</p>

<p>“Congress will be putting itself on the sidelines,” Byrd told the Senate. “Nothing 

would please this president more than having such a blank check handed to him.”</p>

<p>Byrd said his belief in the Constitution will prevent him from voting for Bush’s 

war resolution. “But I am finding that the Constitution is irrelevant to people 

of this administration.”</p>

<p>Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., both praised Byrd after 

he spoke.</p>

<p>“It is the height of patriotism to ask such hard questions,” Clinton said. 

“No one exemplifies that more than the senior senator from West Virginia.”</p>

<p>Byrd said, “Before the nation is committed to war, before we send our sons 

and daughters to battle in faraway lands, there are critical questions that must 

be asked. To date, the answers from the administration have been less than satisfying.”</p>

<p>Byrd repeatedly said Bush has failed to give members of Congress any evidence 

about any immediate danger from Iraq. Byrd also criticized his speech to the United 

Nations.</p>

<p>“Instead of offering compelling evidence that the Iraqi regime had taken steps 

to advance its weapons program, the president offered the U.N. more of a warning 

than an appeal for support.</p>

<p>“Instead of using the forum of the U.N. General Assembly to offer evidence 

and proof of his claims, the president basically told the nations of the world 

that you are either with me, or against me,” Byrd said.</p>

<p>“We must not be hell-bent on an invasion until we have exhausted every other 

possible option to assess and eliminate Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction 

program. We must not act alone. We must have the support of the world.”</p>

<p>Byrd said Congress needs solid evidence and answers to several specific questions, 

including:</p>

<li>Does Saddam Hussein pose an imminent threat to the U.S.? 

<li>Should the United States act alone? 

<li>What would be the repercussions in the Middle East and around the globe? 

<li>How many civilians would die in Iraq? 

<li>How many American forces would be involved? 

<li>How do we afford this war? 

<li>Will the U.S. respond with nuclear weapons if Saddam Hussein uses chemical 

or biological weapons against U.S. soldiers? 

<li>Does the U.S. have enough military and intelligence resources to fight wars 

in Afghanistan and Iraq, while mobilizing resources to prevent attacks on our 

own shores? 

<p>Byrd said the proposed resolution Bush sent Congress on Thursday would be the 

“broadest possible grant of war powers to any president in the history of our 

Republic. The resolution is a direct insult and an affront to the powers given 

to Congress.”</p>

<p>Byrd also criticized Bush’s request for power to carry out “pre-emptive attacks” 

and send troops to Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, the West Bank and anywhere 

else in the Middle East.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe the gall and the arrogance of the White House in requesting 

such a broad grant of war powers,” Byrd said. “This is the worst kind of election-year 

politics.”</p>
