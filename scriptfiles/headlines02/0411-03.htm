Jewish demonstrators demanding that Israel pull out of Palestinian 

territory were arrested in front of the Israeli Consulate in San Francisco 

yesterday, and they vowed that protests would continue all week.

</table></font>Police hauled 16 members of <a href="http://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/" target="_new">A Jewish Voice for Peace</a> out of the middle of 

Montgomery Street -- where they stood for 20 minutes with arms linked, 

chanting slogans and singing Israeli songs -- after they refused to quit 

blocking traffic.

<P>They were all cited for minor traffic infractions related to obstructing 

the roadway and then released, said San Francisco police Captain James Dudley. 

The protest, and the arrests at 1:45 p.m., were conducted with no violent 

outbursts, he said.

<P>The demonstration of about 200 people, which began at noon on the street 

outside the consulate and in its front hallway, was held "to raise another 

Jewish voice, one that lets everyone know that what Israel is doing is not 

happening in our name," said co-organizer Penny Rosenwasser.

<P>"The Israeli army is demolishing Palestinian houses with people still 

inside them, and using older people as human shields in front of their tanks," 

said Rosenwasser, who lives in Oakland. "Bodies are being left to rot in the 

streets.

<P>"It's important that people know we care about Israel and believe it has 

the right to exist, but that Palestinian lives are just as valuable as Israeli 

lives."

<P>About a dozen counter-demonstrators stood near the protesters, holding 

Israeli flags, but there were no clashes between the two sides. A pair of 

dueling protests over the same issue drew about 1,000 demonstrators -- equally 

divided for each camp -- to the consulate last Friday and also ended 

nonviolently.

<P>Rosenwasser said that members of A Jewish Voice For Peace, a Bay Area 

group, would be back at the consulate today with members of <a href="http://www.tikkun.org" target="_new">Tikkun Community</a>, 

another Jewish organization, and that another protest would follow tomorrow 

involving Arabic groups.</p>
