</table>Small nuclear bombs would also be targeted on heavy bunkers and deep cave complexes like the ones used by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.</p> 

<p>US defense experts have been ordered to start the rapid development of new 

weapons.</p>

<p>A senior Westminster source told the Daily Mirror the Ministry of Defense was 

also planning for their use.</p>

<p>He said: "If you are dealing with forces with weapons of mass destruction and the willingness to use them, then we also need to look at new sorts of weapons technology.</p> <p>"Destroying deep cave complexes can take huge amounts of manpower and military force."</p> <p>Donald Anderson, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, called for Ministers to come clean about the proposals.</p> <p>He said: "The development of a new generation of tactical nuclear weapons in response to the terrorist threat would have implications for arms control policy."</p> <p>There was an argument for updating the nuclear strike policy from the Cold War era, when two sides faced each other with massive arsenals.</p> <p>But he said: "If it is to be revised it needs to be done with full public debate, not by a few mandarins talking among themselves."</p> <p>He was backed by a report from his committee.</p> <p>The all-party group said: "The Government must state clearly what is its policy on the first use of nuclear weapons."</p> 

<p>Labour anti-war campaigner Alice Mahon said: "This is madness. It will cross 

a threshold which is totally and completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>"It will give the green light to the rest of the world to get in on the nuclear action and develop their own weapons."</p> <p>She warned that the move will spark a massive rebellion at the party conference in October.</p> <p>Her Halifax party was planning to put in a motion warning against adopting a new nuclear policy and she expected "dozens and dozens" more to flow in to party HQ. Carol Naughton, chairwoman of CND, said: "The adoption of a first strike strategy, potentially with nuclear weapons, is a very disturbing development."</p> 

<p>A Ministry of Defense spokesman said Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon had spelled 

out the position in the Commons two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr Hoon said then: "There has been no change in the essential rules we follow on the use of nuclear weapons.</p> 

<p>"They would be used in only what are described as extreme conditions of self-defense 

... proportionately and consistently with our obligations in international law."</p>

<p>Mr Hoon caused anger this year when he said Britain would be ready to use its long range nuclear weapons against Iraq.</p> <p>In March it was revealed that US President George Bush had ordered a "nuclear posture review".</p> <p>He wants battlefield nuclear weapons to be developed within three years to attack deep underground facilities beyond the reach of conventional weapons.</p> <p>Low yield nuclear warheads could also be used against buried stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons.</p>
