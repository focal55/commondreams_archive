            <p>Under the hot sun, a metal railing snakes its way incongruously 

              through the hills. On one side are olive groves. On the other, huge 

              banana plantations rear up. This is the Green Line, the 1967 border 

              between Israel and the occupied West Bank &#150; and the setting 

              for a very unusual meeting between Palestinian farmers and Israelis 

              from a nearby kibbutz.</p>

            <p>The Palestinians are not allowed to cross the railing into Israel, 

              the Israelis are not supposed to cross it into the West Bank, but 

              they meet here to talk together across the barrier. The olive groves 

              belong to Palestinians from the village of Kafin, the banana plantations 

              to Israelis from Kibbutz Metser. Although they have been neighbors 

              for half a century, few could remember ever meeting like this before.</p>

            <p>The reason for this extraordinary gathering is that the Israeli 

              government is planning to build a wall to separate them completely. 

              Not a metal railing like the small section here, which was begun 

              a few years ago to stop cars crossing, but a full Berlin-style concrete 

              wall that will carve its way through the hills, complete with pillboxes 

              and Israeli snipers to shoot anyone who tries to cross it. The official 

              reason is to prevent Palestinian suicide bombers crossing into Israel.</p>

            <p>The wall will not run along the path of the Green Line, however. 

              Here it will be some 400 to 800 yards east, cutting off the Palestinian 

              farmers completely from their land &#150; for most of them, their 

              only source of income.</p>

            <p>But the Israeli government has run up against an unexpected source 

              of opposition &#150; the people of Kibbutz Metser. There are few 

              more potent symbols of Israel than the kibbutzim, the communes of 

              Jewish families which encapsulated the spirit of the young country 

              in its early days.</p>

            <p>"We think if a wall has to be built here it should be built on 

              the Green Line," said Dov Avital, a leader from the kibbutz. Dressed 

              in the scruffy gray T-shirt and work trousers of a no-nonsense kibbutznik, 

              he stood side by side with the neatly groomed Palestinian Mayor 

              of Kafin, who was wearing a tie despite the intense heat.</p>

            <p>"If land has to be destroyed, we offer our own land," Mr Avital 

              went on. "If a wide strip of land has to be uprooted, we say it 

              should be shared equally between both sides." In the distance the 

              Israeli army had already begun cutting down Palestinian olive trees 

              to make way for the wall.</p>

            <p>The facts are stark. The planned course of the wall will cut off 

              80 per cent of the farming land from the village of Kafin. Most 

              of the village's 10,000 people will lose all their income. There 

              are supposedly plans to issue permits for Palestinian farmers to 

              cross. But according to the Mayor of Kafin, the nearest gate in 

              the wall will involve a six-mile detour. And there are no guarantees 

              they will all get permits.</p>

            <p>Kafin is not an isolated case. Throughout the West Bank, the wall 

              will be a disaster for Palestinians. Long sections of it will not 

              follow the Green Line, but will cut swathes out of Palestinian territory, 

              permanently cutting off thousands of farmers from their land. Some 

              Palestinian villages will be stranded on the Israeli side of the 

              wall, but the villagers will not be allowed into Israel proper.</p>

            <p>Some observers believe the reason for not putting the wall on the 

              Green Line is that Ariel Sharon's government fears that could make 

              it into a de facto border for a future Palestinian state.</p>

            <p>"My father's land used to be over there, on the other side of the 

              Green Line," said Ibrahiam Suleiman, one of the Palestinian farmers. 

              "Now they are taking away what was left after 1948 [when the Palestinians 

              were cut off from their land in the new state of Israel]." He has 

              six children to support and no means of income other than his olive 

              trees.</p>

            <p>One of the Israelis from the kibbutz, Yohanan Margalit, was translating 

              for Mr Suleiman, who spoke no English. We asked the Palestinian 

              farmer what he would do. Mr Margalit, the translator, was visibly 

              shocked at his answer. "He says all that is left for him is to die," 

              he translated. "If they take your land from you, what else can you 

              do?"</p>

            <p>The Israeli shrugged. "I feel a little powerless to do anything 

              about this," he said. "You can speak to your government, but they 

              don't listen." </p>
