<p> WASHINGTON — In two nondescript, heavily guarded offices 10 blocks apart in 

downtown D.C., Kate Michelman and Wanda Franz head bustling national war rooms. 

They are sworn enemies in a resurgent battle across America over women's reproductive 

rights, a confrontation orchestrated out of these private enclaves that could 

soon land back in the U.S. Supreme Court.

<P></P>

Almost three decades after the court affirmed the right of American women to safe 

therapeutic abortions in the historic Roe v. Wade case, the divisive issue is 

on the front burner again, with both sides mounting enormous campaigns to influence 

the November mid-term election.

<P></P>

The issue, about one of the most private decisions women make in their lifetimes, 

is going public again. With pro-life President George W. Bush in the White House, 

proponents on both sides say that never before in the 29 years since Roe v. Wade 

has that ruling been in such peril. 

<P></P>

Both sides' strategies are exactly the same: help elect governors and members 

of the Senate and House who will vote for their views. The Senate, where Democrats 

hold a one-seat majority, is crucial. If pro-life groups can elect like-minded 

senators, they believe their ally in the White House will respond to anticipated 

Supreme Court retirements by appointing judges who will tilt the court's power 

balance in favor of reversing Roe v. Wade. Pro-choice groups are busily planning 

to elect senators who would veto such appointees. 

<P></P>

The Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established the right to 

an abortion, began in Texas when a pregnant waitress, identified in court papers 

by the pseudonym Jane Roe, sued District Attorney Henry Wade, whose job was to 

enforce a state law prohibiting abortion in all cases, except where it was necessary 

to save a woman's life.

<P></P>

The new battle is happening at two Washington offices that are hard to find, and 

even harder to get into.

<P></P>

Near Pennsylvania Ave. downtown, right beside the museum where tourists line up 

to see The House Where Lincoln Died, sits a white, art deco-style building with 

an imposing steel gate, double security doors with buzzers and a security camera 

peering down. Inside Franz's National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) headquarters, 

10,000 square meters are spread over four floors decorated with pictures of babies 

and, on one table, a model showing the developing stages of the fetus. 

<P></P>

NRLC members speak openly about "when," not if, Roe v. Wade will be overturned, 

with Bush's blessing. Last week he delivered an inspirational message via videotape 

to the group's national membership when it gathered in Pittsburgh.

<P></P>

Ten blocks uptown, across the parking lot from the Washington Post offices, Michelman's 

<a href="http://www.naral.org/" target="_new">National Abortion Rights Action 

League</a> (NARAL) occupies a vast array of offices on the seventh floor of a 

more modern building. One must pass a security guard in the lobby, have a swipe 

card for the elevator and then be buzzed through a security door to gain entrance. 

<P></P>

The feeling inside among NARAL workers is of being under siege. Gone is the veto 

power they enjoyed for eight years under pro-choice president Bill Clinton. Since 

the first day of Bush's administration, when he cut off — by executive order — 

funding for international family planning programs, they have watched abortion 

access slowly, but determinedly, be whittled away.

<P></P>

For example, in January, Bush cleared the way for states to allow "unborn children" 

to be eligible for funding under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 

His plan would make the unborn child, not the woman, the client under CHIP and 

was widely perceived as an attempt to lay the groundwork for the Supreme Court 

to one day declare the fetus a "person" entitled to rights and protections.

<P></P>

The White House is also backing the state of Ohio's defense in court of its ban 

on mid-term, so-called "partial birth" abortions. Such abortions are very rare, 

but can occur in the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy when the fetus is discovered 

to be severely damaged, or the woman's life is put in danger by the continued 

pregnancy. The NRLC is working with members of Congress to try to pass a national 

ban on partial birth abortions.<b> 

<P></P>

</b>Michelman says it doesn't take much tea-leaf reading to understand the grave 

threat posed to Canadian women if Roe v. Wade is overturned, despite the protections 

of the Canadian Supreme Court's 1987 decision in the case of Dr. Henry Morgentaler.

<P></P>

The two countries share the world's longest undefended border. She says there 

is no way American pro-life groups, if emboldened further by Roe v. Wade's defeat, 

would stand idle while American women hop over the border for abortions. Given 

the existing close ties to Canadian pro-life groups, Canada would become the next 

battleground.

<P></P>

"I don't think people realize what a critical moment we've reached in the historic 

struggle for women's rights to reproductive freedom and choice," Michelman says.
