In an 11th-hour settlement reached yesterday, former Green Party candidate Ralph Nader dropped his suit against the Commission on Presidential Debates for barring him from attending the October 2000 debate in Boston after the commission agreed to issue an apology and pay an undisclosed amount of money.



<P>The case was scheduled to go to trial today in US District Court in Boston.</P>

<P>Chief US District Judge William G. Young already had dismissed several of Nader's claims, and in pretrial hearings in February had suggested that Nader had presented little evidence to bolster his complex civil rights case against the commission.</P>

<P>''I'm glad that after 18 months we spent on this, it has been resolved,'' said Janet Brown, executive director of the commission. ''We don't believe his claims were substantiated.''</P>

<P>Nader had mounted a  crusade against the commission after he was barred from attending the presidential debate at the University of Massachusetts-Boston on Oct. 3, 2000, because security officials considered him a likely disruption. Two days before, Nader, who had not been invited to participate in the debate as a third-party candidate, had publicly declared, ''Maybe I'll crawl up on the stage there.''</P>

<P>Originally scheduled to begin March 4, the trial had already been pushed back twice before the  sudden resolution yesterday. According to Brown, Nader's lawyers contacted the commission last week to discuss a settlement after last-minute depositions  weakened Nader's case.</P>

<P>The apology letter has not been finalized and commission lawyers would only confirm that some ''token'' amount of money would be paid.</P>

<P>In a statement yesterday, Nader reiterated that he had demanded that the commission contribute $25,000 to the Appleseed Center for Electoral Reform at Harvard Law School. But it could not be determined yesterday if the commission had agreed to make the donation to settle the case.</P>

<P>Nader  contended that the commission violated his civil rights by prohibiting him from watching the debate on the UMass campus and then serving as a guest commentator for Fox News.</P>

<P>''The debates are produced for a huge national and international audience,'' Brown said. ''We try very hard to avoid disruption.''</P>

<P>The commission is an independent nonprofit organization led by two former Republican and Democratic party chairmen. Since it began sponsoring presidential debates in 1988, it has staved off numerous lawsuits from third-party and independent candidates who chafe at being excluded from one of the most-watched events of the campaign season.</P>

<P>Current rules require that a candidate  have at least 15 percent of the electorate's support in opinion polls to join the debates.</P>
