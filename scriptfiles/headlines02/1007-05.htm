<p>RIO DE JANEIRO - </b> Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva easily won Sunday's presidential 

elections in Brazil, but failed to garner the majority needed to avoid a run-off 

vote, slated for Oct 27, in nationwide balloting that was bogged down by voters' 

problems with a computerized ballot. 

<p> Lula, 57, leader of the leftist Workers Party (PT) and a former metalworker, 

gave his rivals a run for their money with his Lula President coalition that includes 

the right-leaning Liberal Party, and its José Alencar, textile mogul, as his vice-presidential 

candidate. 

<p> With around 47 percent of the vote, Lula will face José Serra, 60, candidate 

of the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government and of the "Grand Alliance" between 

the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) and the Brazilian Democratic Movement 

Party (PMDB), two of the country's leading political forces. 

<p> Serra polled at nearly a quarter of the valid votes cast for president Sunday. 

<p> Brazil's Electoral Tribunal was scheduled to announce the official results 

at midnight Sunday (3:00 GMT Monday), but delays involving the computerized ballot 

ruined those plans. 

<p> The Electoral Tribunal, which regulates the voting process, reported that 

less than one percent of the 406,000 electronic ballot boxes used across the country 

presented defects. But in at least 110 voting stations it was necessary to use 

the traditional manual balloting method. 

<p> Even with the second round presidential elections, Lula is considered the 

favorite. The electoral support of the PT is more consolidated than that of the 

other parties, say political analysts. 

<p> Most of the people who cast their ballots for leftists Ciro Gomes or Anthony 

Garotinho, two candidates who won an important portion of the vote (around 13 

and 17 percent, respectively) but not enough to beat Serra, are more likely to 

support Lula. 

<p> Lula's candidacy also received a boost from two former presidents José Sarney 

(1985-1990) and Itamar Franco (1992-1994), both of the PMDB, who threw their support 

behind the metalworker-turned-politician. 

<p> Furthermore, general support for the PT increased in the final days of the 

campaign, as evidenced in several local races, such as the governorship of Sao 

Paulo, Brazil's most populous and wealthiest state. The PT's José Genoina defied 

all predictions and will face current governor Geraldo Alckmin in the run-off 

vote. 

<p> Economist Aloizio Mercadante, PT candidate for the Senate representing Sao 

Paulo, also saw greater than expected support. The rise of the PT in Sao Paulo 

state is decisive for Lula's chances on Oct 27 as it is home to nearly 20 percent 

of the national electorate. 

<p> But the run-off vote "is a different election", say analysts. José Pimenta 

da Veiga, former communications minister and director of Serra's campaign, believes 

it is possible to erase the 20-million-vote advantage Lula had Sunday in the three 

weeks before the second round. 

<p> The debate now will be between just two candidates, and the best one will 

be able to alter the situation, says Da Veiga. 

<p> Meanwhile, in economic and financial circles, it is being assumed that Lula 

will be Brazil's president as of Jan 1, the day that Cardoso ends his second four-year 

term. 

<p> It will be up to him to prevent Brazil's financial collapse under pressures 

of economic crises throughout Latin America, but the major challenge in the next 

four years will be to reduce the country's profound social inequalities and poverty. 

<p> Brazil is among the countries with the biggest gap between rich and poor, 

to the extent that sociologists often use the term "Brazilianization" to describe 

processes in other countries in which the poor distribution of wealth continues 

to worsen. 

<p> The demand for solutions will be especially burdensome for Lula, as he is 

seen as the standard-bearer of movements that have historically been involved 

in social justice issues. 

<p> The gap between rich and poor in this giant South American nation -- home 

to more than 160 million people -- is seen as the result of a series of economic 

crises over the last 20 years. 

<p> Inequalities, impunity and the ease of obtaining weapons are blamed as the 

main causes of the rise in violence that costs Brazil 1.9 percent of its gross 

domestic product (GDP) in medical treatment for its victims, says a World Health 

Organization report released Thursday. 

<p> The percentage of people without enough income to pay for their basic necessities 

was reduced by the implementation in 1994 of Plan Real, which put an end to three 

decades of high inflation, though it has begun an upwards climb again in the last 

three years. 

<p> In 1993, 41.7 percent of the population lived in such a situation, falling 

to 32.7 percent in 1998. But last year, 33.6 percent could not meet their basic 

necessities on their income, reflecting the turning point in 1999, when the financial 

crisis caused a sharp depreciation of the national currency, the real. 

<p> In 2001, 58 million people earned less than they needed to ensure a minimally 

decent standard of living, and of them, at least 22 percent lacked sufficient 

income to maintain adequate nutrition. 

<p> Brazil suffers greater income disparity than Mexico and much more than Argentina, 

and poverty here is not a problem of wealth, but rather of its distribution, according 

to researchers.</p>
