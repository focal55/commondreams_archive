<p> WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Colin Powell will lead the American delegation 

to the <a href="http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/" target="_new">World Summit 

on Sustainable Development</a>, to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa from 

August 26 through September 4. President George W. Bush made the announcement 

late Monday, giving no explanation as to why he will not be attending the summit 

to join 106 other world leaders on the speaker's podium.

</table></font>Secretary Powell will be joined by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator 

Christie Todd Whitman, Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality James 

Connaughton, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Andrew Natsios, 

and Under Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky, the President said. 

<p> The World Summit on Sustainable Development is sponsored by the United Nations 

as a 10 year follow up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which was attended 

by then President George H.W. Bush, father of the current President. 

<p> Other heads of government and heads of state who are on the speakers list 

in Johannesburg include all the other leaders of G8 countries - UK Prime Minister 

Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, 

Italian President Silvio Berlusconi and Russia's Vladimir Putin among them. 

<p> President Bush has been under pressure from Republican Party and conservative 

lobbyists not to attend the summit. 

<p> A letter to Bush made public Friday by Friends of the Earth UK shows the nature 

of that pressure. Dated August 2, the letter is signed by 31 political groups 

and individuals. It says "We applaud your decision not to attend the summit in 

person." 

<p> "Even more than the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992," the letter says, "the Johannesburg 

Summit will provide a global media stage for many of the most irresponsible and 

destructive elements involved in critical international economic and environmental 

issues. Your presence would only help to publicize and make more credible various 

anti-freedom, anti-people, anti-globalization, and anti-Western agendas." 

<p> Signatories to the letter include representatives of seven think tanks that 

receive funding from oil giant ExxonMobil, according to figures in an official 

Exxon document. 

<p> The lobbyists' letter states that "the least important global environmental 

issue is potential global warming, and we hope that your negotiators at Johannesburg 

can keep it off the table and out of the spotlight." 

<p> In his announcement Monday, President Bush said the U.S. team will offer plans 

that "advance the new approach to development that I embraced with other national 

leaders at the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development this past May." 

<p> "This new approach is based on shared accountability among developed and developing 

nations," the President said. 

<p> "The U.S. delegation will come to Johannesburg with concrete and practical 

proposals for strong and lasting partnerships to advance some of the world's key 

development priorities - clean water, modern energy, good health, and productive 

agriculture - that can lead us to a world without poverty," said President Bush. 

<p> A U.S. federal government report prepared for the World Summit on Sustainable 

Development issued today says the U.S. team will be promoting "good governance" 

and anticorruption at the summit, in particular "an integrated, cross-sectoral 

approach to addressing governance and sustainable development." 

<p> "The U.S. Government promotes good governance in every region of the world 

and believes that a good governance component makes environmentally oriented programs 

more effective. USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] is the lead 

agency in this work, providing &#36;700 million annually to support an array of 

democracy and governance activities," the report says. 

<p> The goals of U.S. assistance programs that support good governance are: democratic 

institutions that are effective, accountable, and transparent; an independent 

and fair judiciary; law enforcement that - with integrity - protects the people 

while strengthening their capacity to combat corruption; sound monetary; fiscal, 

and trade policies that promote economic growth, social development, and environmental 

protection; participation by all members of civil society in decisions that affect 

them.
