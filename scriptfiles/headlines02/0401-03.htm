BERLIN - 

Thousands of people attended Easter peace marches in cities across Germany on Monday, calling for a halt to the violence in the Middle East and voicing opposition to the U.S.-led military campaign to root out terrorism around the world.

<p>



The marches, a traditional appointment for left-wing groups in Germany, appeared better attended than usual, prompting organizers to claim that Germans are increasingly queasy about the country's role in the international coalition.</p>

<p>

In Berlin, some 1,200 protesters marched from the Alexanderplatz square in the former communist east of the capital to the Brandenburg Gate, brandishing banners with slogans including "Stop Bush's global war" and "War is the terror of the arms industry."</p>

<p>

About a third of the marchers, many carrying Palestinian flags, chanted slogans against Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  and "Intifada until victory."</p>

<p>

Others called for the withdrawal of German troops deployed to areas including Afghanistan and West Africa as part of the search for members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida and the Taliban.</p>

<p>

Demonstrations, church services and bicycle rallies were held by peace activists in some 70 cities, including Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich over the Easter holiday period.</p>

<p>

Germany's sizable pacifist movement, including lawmakers for the former East German communist party, has been vocal in its criticism of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's pledge of "unrestricted solidarity" with the United States following the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>

<p>

Peace groups and anti-globalization activists have announced plans for massive demonstrations during U.S. President George W. Bush's planned trip to Germany in May.</p>
