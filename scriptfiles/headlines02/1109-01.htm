Italy - More than half a million anti-war protesters from across Europe marched 

through this Italian Renaissance city on Saturday in a loud and colorful demonstration 

denouncing any possible U.S. attack on Iraq.

</font>Brimming with anti-American feelings and riled by a tough new U.N. resolution 

to disarm Iraq, young and old activists from as far afield as Russia and Portugal 

joined forces for the carnival-like rally, singing 1970s peace songs. 

<p>"Take your war and go to hell," read one banner, in a  forest of multi-colored and multi-lingual placards.<p>"Drop Bush, not Bombs" read another. Some placards depicted  President Bush as Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi as Mussolini.<p>Organizers said the rally, planned months ago, gained added  relevance by Friday's U.N. Security Council resolution which  gave Iraq a last chance to disarm or face almost certain war.

<p>The protest, involving children as well as grandmothers, marked the climax 

of the first <a href="http://www.fse-esf.org/" target="_new">European Social Forum</a>, 

a four-day meeting of anti-globalization campaigners from all over Europe. Delegates 

discussed topics from debt-reduction to support for the Palestinian uprising against 

Israeli occupation.

<p>Florence has been virtually shut down for the November 6-10  period, with the State Department advising its citizens to  steer clear of Italy's art capital over concerns that violent,  anarchist groups might infiltrate the demonstration.<p>Authorities estimated that some 450,000 protesters flooded  Florence's streets for the march on a chilly autumn afternoon.<p>But by dusk, the crowed had swelled to over half a million,  many of them arriving on specially chartered trains and buses.  Organizers estimated the gathering at around one million,  making it one of Italy's biggest ever anti-war rallies.<p>Despite the large crowds, the march was largely peaceful  and no incidents were reported.<p>"The atmosphere here is wonderful. Absolutely perfect. It  shows that a new young left is emerging," said Stavos Valsamis,  a 27-year-old Greek activist from Athens.<p>Children climbed on their parents' shoulders to get a view  of the sea of crowds marching along the seven-km (4.5-miles)  route. Many clapped as marchers passed by.<p>"This is amazing, it's so impressive," said 12-year-old  Bianca Ronglia as she watched with her family from the side of  the road. "I'm happy and proud that my city is holding this."<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

Station in Florence, Italy, Friday, Nov. 8, 2002. An anti-globalization meeting 

organized by the European Social Forum started Wednesday and is expected to bring 

over 450,000 anti-war activists who will take to the streets for a massive demonstration 

on Saturday. (AP Photo/Pier Paolo Cito) <br>

</table></font>BIGGER THAN GENOA<p>The march was bigger than a protest at a G8 summit in Genoa  last year, when 300,000 demonstrators took to the streets and  an orgy of violence left one protester dead and hundreds  injured.<p>Some 7,000 police officers were on call but security forces  kept a low profile along the rally's route. No incidents were  reported.<p>The rest of Florence was a ghost town with most shops in  the art-rich historical center pulling down the shutters for  fear of vandals. However, the city's famed museums remained  open and offered free entry to the few tourists around.<p>Many Florence residents deserted the city for the four days  of the forum, prompting criticism from those who stayed behind.<p>"I'm really disappointed by my fellow Florentines -- it  really shows very little faith. This whole event has been very  calm, in fact the city has been much calmer and friendlier than  usual," said housewife Maria Briccoli, 37.<p>As well as university-age students, older political  activists and thousands of trades unionists, Saturday's throng  also included Italian World War II partisans and a U.S. Vietnam  war veteran who marched in the first row of the crowd.<p>While Friday's U.N. resolution gives the Security Council a  central role in assessing the new arms' inspection program for  Iraq, it does not require the United States to seek U.N.  authorization for war in case of violations.

<p>"I think it's a scandalous resolution," said Sean Murray, 29, a member of Workers' 

Revolution. "It proves once more that the U.N. is a puppet of America, Britain 

and France."
