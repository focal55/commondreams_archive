<p>Student Government passed a resolution Tuesday condemning any attack on Iraq 

by the Bush administration after a heated debate and a narrow vote.

<p> The assembly of hundreds roared as the 20-17 vote was read by Vice President 

Stacey Kounelias.

<p> "This makes the statement that the student body of the nation's largest university 

and in Bush's hometown feels that an unprovoked war is wrong," said SG two-year 

at-large Representative Jordan Buckley, author of the resolution and a key mediator 

in the evening's debate.

</font>The anti-war resolution, thought by most representatives to stand little 

chance of passing, condemns Saddam Hussein but opposes any pre-emptive attack 

against Iraq.

<p> The bitter debate fought not only the resolution, but the assembly's right 

to vote on a resolution at all.

<p> "For those of you who feel it is inappropriate to debate foreign policy within 

the Student Government institution, please realize that it is more inappropriate 

that people die at the hands of the United States," said Amber Novak, a journalism 

graduate student.

<p> The vote set a precedent for the assembly, said Buckley, who rallied support 

until minutes before the meeting's start.

<p> Ben Durham, a liberal arts representative, said supporting a preemptive strike 

against the Iraqi people directly involved the University. Durham cited the U.S. 

Energy Department's Academic Strategic Alliances Program, which involves universities, 

he said, in the production and research of weapons of mass destruction.

<p> Advocates for the resolution argued that the United States has supported Saddam 

previously, and a hunger for control of the world's oil supply weighed heavily 

in its push for war.

<p> Representatives would be held accountable for their vote, said Andrew Dobbs, 

a communication studies freshman.

<p> "We will make sure that whoever votes against this resolution will be out 

of this room next year," Dobbs said.

<p> Opposition rebuked the credibility of the resolution's declarations and its 

authors. The Young Conser-vatives of Texas vehemently objected to any variation 

from the congressional package passed last week and became irate at claims that 

Bush mongers terrorism.

<p> "It's a dark day for the diverse views that constitute this university," religious 

studies sophomore Austin Kinghorn said. "I thank the members that opposed this."

<p> SG President Katie King, who under procedure, could not vote on the issue, 

yielded her chance to speak to Charles Ganske of the H.L. Menken Society, a conservative 

campus group.

<p> Ganske said his father, a veteran of two wars, performed a necessary duty 

for his country. Ganske responded to questions of conscience of soldiers who kill 

in conflict, saying the defense of U.S. freedoms could justify such actions.

<p> The resolution also condemned any racial backlash against persons of Middle 

Eastern decent that might come as a result of war.

<p> Some representatives and the Young Conservatives of Texas said a different 

resolution could be seen in the assembly soon. Tuesday's proposal spawned numerous 

questions of documentation and diction.

<p> Students on both sides of the issue praised the assembly for facilitating 

the open debate on such a pertinent issue.

<p> "The point is we're debating the issue," Durham said.

<p> Proponents of the resolution mobbed Buckley upon the result - the culmination 

of the four-hour debate. Buckley said the entire situation was a draining experience 

and a positive step for the peace movement and for challenging the U.S. government's 

rush for war.

<p> "I'm overwhelmed," Buckley said. "This is unbelievable." </p>
