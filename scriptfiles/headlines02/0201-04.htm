WASHINGTON - A few months after the White House got a list of recommended candidates 

from former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, a friend and backer of President Bush, 

two of them were appointed to a federal energy commission. 

<p>Lay gave the list of names to Clay Johnson, Bush's personnel director, White 

House spokeswoman Anne Womack said Thursday. Among the eight or so names were 

Pat Wood, now chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Nora Brownell, 

a member of the commission. 

<p> "It was one of many, many recommendations that he (Johnson) received" from 

industry executives, members of Congress and state officials, Womack said in an 

interview.</p>

<p> Disclosure of Lay's recommendations to the White House last spring comes as 

congressional panels investigate the relationship between Houston-based Enron 

Corp., which filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, and the Bush administration.</p>

<p> The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating 

Enron's complex accounting and what role its auditor, Arthur Andersen, played 

in the Houston-based company's collapse. Andersen has acknowledged destroying 

Enron-related documents.</p>

<p> A senator leading an investigation said Thursday that Enron had not cooperated 

in providing important information on the complex web of partnerships used by 

the company to conceal massive debts. The company's attorney said it doesn't have 

the documents sought.</p>

<p> As head of a major campaign donor, Enron, wielding significant influence in 

Washington, Lay enjoyed access to top government officials of both parties. The 

White House has acknowledged that Lay met once privately last year with Vice President 

Dick Cheney, who headed a task force that formulated the administration's national 

energy policy.</p>

<p> Lay disclosed the existence of the list of Enron favorites in an interview 

being broadcast Friday on PBS' "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/index.html" target="_new">NOW 

with Bill Moyers</a>."</p>

<p> "I brought a list, we certainly presented a list. ... As I recall, I signed 

a letter which in fact had some recommendations as to people that we thought would 

be good (FERC) commissioners," Lay said in the interview, which was taped in May 

but never aired.</p>

<p> Bush, as Texas governor, had appointed Wood in 1995 as head of the state's 

Public Utilities Commission. Wood has been an advocate of market-oriented regulation 

of utilities, a position espoused by Enron, a big, aggressive energy trader that 

had become a favorite of Wall Street.</p>

<p> Bush appointed Wood as FERC chairman in August, replacing Curt Hebert.</p>

<p> Hebert said in the PBS interview that Lay "has asked me to take certain positions 

but I've had those conversations with Ken Lay for a long time. And have disagreed 

with him for a long time."</p>

<p> Brownell, a member of Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission, was nominated 

by Bush in March. During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee 

Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation.</p>

<p> Lay will be the star witness next week as a blizzard of hearings by several 

congressional panels put the Enron collapse under intense public scrutiny.</p>

<p> Enron officials "just simply have not cooperated" in providing the documents 

sought, said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of a Senate Commerce subcommittee. 

"We again renew our request."</p>

<p> An estimated 3,000 partnerships, some with names of "Star Wars" characters 

such as Jedi, were created by Enron, which took a 97 percent stake in each of 

them and brought in outside investors for the remainder. The partnerships were 

kept off Enron's books and helped create the accounting debacle that pushed the 

company into the biggest U.S. corporate bankruptcy filing ever.</p>

<p> Dorgan said the committee had no immediate plan to subpoena the documents 

from the company.</p>

<p> Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing Enron, said, "We have been 

fully cooperating with them."</p>

<p> Bennett said the committee has asked Enron for documents that the company 

doesn't have and must be obtained from the partnerships or people representing 

them.</p>

<p> "We are exercising enormous good faith in cooperating with that committee," 

the attorney said in a telephone interview.</p>

<p> In a related dispute between Congress and the Bush administration, investigators 

at the General Accounting Office told the White House on Wednesday they would 

sue to make officials identify the industry executives, including some from Enron, 

who met last year with Cheney's energy task force.</p>
