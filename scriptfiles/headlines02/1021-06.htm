<p> PRAGUE - The external debt of developing countries should not just be cancelled 

but the debtors compensated, civil society activists told a meeting of international 

officials, business leaders, scientists and non-governmental organizations members 

in Prague Saturday.

<p> The globalization process led by corporations has ''privatized profits and 

nationalized debt,'' said Indian journalist and food security activist Anuradha 

Mittal. The issue now is not just cancellation of external debt, it is time for 

reparations to those victimized by neo-liberal economic policies, she said. 

<p> Other activists made a similar demand. ''Your reform does not include compensation 

for the damage done to hundreds of millions of lives,'' said Pakistani journalist 

and women's rights activist Najma Sadeque, looking straight at Eduardo Aninat, 

deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

<p> The demand came at a meeting called by the Forum 2000 Foundation led by Czech 

President Vaclav Havel. The conference has brought together more than 40 leading 

officials, scholars and activists from all over the world. It aims to create a 

dialogue between divergent views that is otherwise missing. 

<p> Aninat, a former finance minister in Chile and a keynote speaker on the first 

day of the two-day conference 'Bridging Global Gaps' acknowledged that the IMF 

was ''imperfect'' but defended its record of reforming itself. 

<p> Aninat criticized NGOs for their ''impatience'' in achieving goals such as 

environmental protection and elimination of poverty. ''Yes, power is as it has 

been described here and yes, institutions are imperfect, but we have to move forward 

with this agenda (of economic growth) and not just deliver nice speeches,'' he 

said. 

<p> ''Without growth we can do a lot of statements but in the medium term we will 

not achieve the purpose of improving living standards,'' he said. 

<p> Argentinean politician Mario Cafiero said that not long ago his country was 

the IMF's ''best student'' but that it is now becoming a pariah state. He accused 

the financial institutions of promoting corruption by providing easy loans to 

military dictators in the seventies and eighties. 

<p> ''It is a dirty external debt which comes from a military dictatorship and 

was used not to finance investment and development, but capital flow,'' said Cafiero. 

<p> The IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO) were prime 

targets of activists and political scientists who warned of environmental and 

social catastrophe if the current system of trade and financial relations continues. 

The organizers hope that antagonistic positions can come a little closer together 

through workshops held after the first plenary. 

<p> Mark Sakady, a U.S. economist and advisor to the Global Compact initiative 

of the United Nations asked NGOs to keep up their passion but stop acting victimized. 

They should participate in a new ''global social contract'' in which all would 

learn to listen better to others. 

<p> That seemed easier said than done. ''There is an unbridgeable gap between 

the need of multinational corporations to increase profit and those of making 

the planet viable,'' said British scientist Edward Goldsmith. 

<p> People also seem not to understand that global warming ''is going to affect 

every aspect of our lives'' by increasing poverty, pushing millions of people 

out of their lands, unleashing deadly diseases and causing a loss of some 30 per 

cent of the world's agricultural land, Goldsmith said. 

<p> ''Even if we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, the planet will keep warming 

for another 150 years,'' he said. 

<p> U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said that more than the IMF or the World Bank, 

governments in rich countries, the U.S. in particular, are responsible for the 

imbalances and shortcomings of globalization. ''The current path is taking us 

to war and mass pandemic disease,'' he said. 

<p> 'Bridging Global Gaps' was inaugurated Friday evening at the majestic Czech 

National Museum by President Havel and co-sponsor Yohei Sasakawa, a Japanese philanthropist 

and president of the Nippon Foundation. 

<p> Havel said that instead of big annual meetings as planned initially, Forum 

2000 would initiate smaller gatherings to bring together those who must play a 

fundamental role in the survival of Earth. 

<p> Mats Karlsson, a Swedish economist and vice-president for global communications 

with the World Bank said he was tired of hearing again and again ''that things 

are not happening.'' He praised the ''new leaders'' of developing countries. Had 

any of them been invited to the conference, delegates ''would hear another story'' 

on economic growth and development, he said. 

<p> The moderator for the plenary, Czech professor Josef Jazab, hoped that Prague 

with its enlightened architecture and the humanistic spirit that had attempted 

to give ''socialism a human face'' 35 years ago would now exert a positive influence 

on the debate. 

<p> In August 1968, however, the ''Prague spring'' was crushed by Soviet tanks, 

sent by those who panicked at the prospect of uncontrolled civil forces taking 

charge of their lives.
