<p>UNITED NATIONS - Human rights activists and senior U.N. officials have faulted 

an Indonesian court for imposing a lenient sentence on a former governor of East 

Timor charged with war crimes. 

<p> "The accused (Governor Abilio Soares) was found guilty of the charge (of crimes 

against humanity) and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, which is below the 

statutory minimum of 10 years," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary 

Robinson, said Thursday. 

<p> The sentence was imposed Wednesday by a homegrown war crimes court called 

the Ad Hoc Human Rights Tribunal in Jakarta, whose creation last year had the 

blessings of the U.N. Security Council. 

<p> Soares faced the death penalty for failing to halt the "large-scale, organized 

and coordinated violence" after the Indonesian-held territory voted for independence 

in late 1999. According to some reports, more than 1,000 civilians died during 

rioting after the vote. 

<p> On Thursday, the Tribunal also found that the former regional police commander 

and five other military, police and government officials were not guilty. 

<p> John Miller of the New York-based <a href="http://www.etan.org" target="_new">East 

Timor Action Network</a> said the verdict shows the United Nations and the Security 

Council should have set up an international war crimes tribunal for East Timor 

modeled on those created for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. 

<p> Both tribunals, created by the Security Council, are currently holding trials 

for those accused of genocide and war crimes in the two war-ravaged countries. 

<p> "The verdict by the tribunal in Jakarta shows the process was badly constituted," 

Miller told IPS. 

<p> "The Security Council, in effect, said 'let's give Indonesia a chance'", Miller 

said. "They have been given a chance - and now it's up to the Council to create 

an international tribunal," he said. 

<p> The verdicts were the first arising from a series of human rights trials in 

Jakarta, where more than 18 army officers and civilians are being prosecuted for 

atrocities committed in late 1999. 

<p> The new government in East Timor has also established a body to try allegations 

of serious crimes, including war crimes, but Indonesia has so far refused to co-operate 

with it. 

<p> Miller said an international tribunal for East Timor is needed because the 

newly created International Criminal Court (ICC) can only try those accused of 

genocide and war crimes after it came into force on Jul. 1. 

<p> Robinson said the United Nations is concerned prosecutors in Soares' trial 

did not submit evidence that portrayed the killings and other human rights violations 

as part of a widespread and systematic pattern of violence. 

<p> "Rather, the indictments present the killings and other abuses as a result 

of spontaneous conflict between armed factions within East Timorese society," 

she said. 

<p> "This seriously undermines the strength of the prosecution's case and jeopardizes 

the integrity and credibility of the process," Robinson added. 

<p> She also said the United Nations was concerned that prosecutions to date have 

presented to the court "only a small percentage of the available testimony and 

evidence of victims and eyewitnesses to the 1999 violence". 

<p> Amnesty International also criticized the Tribunal. In a statement, the human 

rights group said the indictments presented in court did not correspond with the 

available evidence. 

<p> Prosecutors "deliberately failed to prove the widespread and systematic nature 

of the violations that occurred in East Timor", it added. 

<p> The judge who delivered the verdict against Soares blamed the United Nations 

for recruiting "pro-independence" staff and election monitors when it conducted 

the vote. 

<p> The judges, the prosecutors and defendants also accused the United Nations 

Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) of "irregularities" in the conduct of the vote 

in the territory in September, 1999. 

<p> "These allegations are false," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters 

Thursday. 

<p> Indonesian authorities, not UNAMET, were responsible for security throughout 

the entire consultation process, as set out in agreements signed by the United 

Nations and Indonesia, he said. 

<p> "Further UNAMET was completely unarmed," Eckhard said, in contrast to the 

Indonesian military. 

<p> And an independent Electoral Commission certified the results, after a close 

scrutiny of complaints, he added. "Not one ballot box was unaccounted for." 

<p> Recruitment for UNAMET was open to all qualified East Timorese, regardless 

of their political beliefs. As a result, said Eckhard, it cannot be concluded 

that the violence was a consequence of "any irregularities in the ballot, bias 

or abdication of security responsibility on the part of UNAMET". 

<p> "It should also be recalled that in the violence, U.N. local staff were killed 

because they worked for UNAMET, and U.N. property was systematically looted and 

destroyed."
