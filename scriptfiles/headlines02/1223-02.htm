<p>BAGHDAD -- A candle clutched in one hand, Elizabeth Boardman is bundled up 

in a chill desert wind, standing outside the Al-Taji power-generating plant 15 

miles from downtown Baghdad. <P>The plant was destroyed by U.S. bombs in the 1991 

Gulf War, and if war comes again, as seems increasingly likely, American missiles 

may once again reduce the plant to rubble. Elizabeth Boardman, 61, is here to 

"bear witness," doing her part, however small, and possibly in vain, to try to 

stop it. <P>"Saddam Hussein doesn't know me, and I'm not here to support him," 

says Boardman, one of several dozen foreign peace activists conducting a vigil 

in the cold Iraq night air. "I'm here to stand with the Iraqi people, who are 

suffering from U.S. policies that I think are completely wrong." <P>With war perhaps 

just weeks away, activists such as Boardman have been coming to Iraq, and some 

say they will stay even if the bombs start to fall and American soldiers fight 

their way through the streets of Baghdad. They are here, they insist, not to support 

the regime of Saddam Hussein -- "He's an evil man," says Boardman -- but to remind 

the world of the damage a war can bring. <P>Their presence angers critics who 

regard activists like Boardman as propaganda dupes of a totalitarian regime. <P>When 

actor and Marin County resident Sean Penn visited Baghdad last week, he was labeled 

by some as a latter-day "Hanoi Jane," a reference to actress Jane Fonda's notorious 

visit to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Further ammunition for such criticisms 

came when the Iraqi government claimed that Penn agreed with its contention that 

the regime possessed no weapons of mass destruction, an assertion angrily denied 

by Penn. <P>Boardman insists she is not driven by politics or ideology. The executive 

director of the North and South Market Adult Day Health Center, a San Francisco 

nonprofit that provides medical care for senior citizens, Boardman describes herself 

as a "hard-core Quaker pacifist." <P><b>FAMILY TRADITION</b> <P>The daughter of 

a World War II conscientious objector, she protested U.S. intervention in Central 

America in the 1980s by withholding her federal income taxes. Now, with a war 

in Iraq seeming closer, she decided that Baghdad was the place to be. <P>"My daughter 

said, 'Oh, Mom, you would do this,' and a lot of other friends and family worry 

about me here. And I was petrified for a while after I made the decision to come," 

she says. "But I just remind people now of the Iraqi civilians and U.S. soldiers 

who will be in real danger. They're the ones to worry about." <P>Standing alongside 

Boardman outside the Al-Taji power plant are Catholics, Mennonites, Jews and Buddhists, 

prompted to come here, they say, by deeply held religious beliefs. <P>"The principal 

thing for me, for my soul, is to identify with the victims," says Charles Liteky, 

a former Army chaplain who says he plans to stay if war comes. A San Francisco 

resident whose long career as an anti-war activist has earned him two stints in 

federal prison, Liteky spends most of his days here at a local orphanage run by 

Catholic nuns, helping children with cerebral palsy to eat and play. <P>"I may 

be able to save a child in the orphanage during the bombing, or administer first 

aid to somebody in the neighborhood with the skills I learned in Vietnam," says 

the 71-year-old Liteky, who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1968 

when he carried 22 wounded soldiers to safety during heavy combat in Vietnam. 

<P>Asked whether he would do the same for a wounded American soldier fighting 

in Baghdad, Liteky responds, "Of course I'd go get him, no matter whether he was 

an American soldier or an Iraqi soldier. They're all human beings." <P><b>VOICES 

IN THE WILDERNESS</b> <P>Liteky, Boardman and other activists are members of an 

organization called Voices in the Wilderness, whose headquarters is in Chicago. 

The anti-war group has brought dozens of American delegations to Iraq since 1996 

to protest U.S. policies toward Iraq and U.N. sanctions, in effect since the 1991 

Gulf War, saying they have unfairly affected Iraq's civilian population. <P>After 

Voices in the Wilderness was fined $20,000 by the Treasury Department for violating 

the U.S. ban on travel to Iraq, members of the group traveled to Washington earlier 

this month to deliver payment -- in virtually worthless Iraqi dinars. <P>Kathy 

Kelly, co-founder of Voices in the Wilderness, acknowledges that her organization's 

credibility was tarred last September when it staged a demonstration outside U.N. 

headquarters in Baghdad. Critics point out that demonstrations except those staged 

by the government are usually banned. <P>It was "a disaster," she said. "We're 

here to protest the fact that U.N. sanctions and U.S. bombs have killed hundreds 

of thousands of children in the past decade, but we get saddled somehow with being 

dupes." <P>Many of the activists seemed aware of the contradictions of protesting 

against U.S. policies in a country where free speech is sharply curtailed. <P>"If 

I got up in a church service here and yelled, 'Down with Saddam,' I'd be tossed 

out of here, I wouldn't last 24 hours," admits the Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a Catholic 

Maryknoll priest and longtime anti-war activist who just ended a two-week visit 

with other religious activists, during which they held a service at a local Chaldean 

Catholic church and read a statement opposing a U.S. war. "There's control here 

that I've never seen." <P>Many of the visiting Americans say that whatever their 

misgivings about the political situation, they have been surprised by the warmth 

and hospitality of everyday Iraqis they have met. <P>"I expected people here to 

be very angry at Americans, but I've found that they make distinctions between 

the American people and our government, which is a lot more than our government 

does in return," said Sister Simone Campbell, a Catholic nun who is a Sacramento 

lobbyist for Jericho, an interfaith social- services coalition. "I met a mother 

who can't get chemotherapy for her young boy with cancer because the medicines 

are viewed as 'dual use,' " referring to materials that the United Nations says 

could be used for chemical or biological weapons. "It broke my heart. But she 

was very sweet. She wasn't angry at me." <P><b>WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTS</b> <P>But 

even those who say they are willing to stay even if war comes know there may be 

little they can do once the shooting starts. <P>"We couldn't stop a bomb with 

our bodies, and we can't stop the war," said Kelly. <P>Nevertheless, for Boardman, 

who plans to return to the Bay Area early next month, her visit to Iraq has been 

more than a quixotic gesture. In addition to resuming her day job, she says, she 

will be undertaking a hectic round of speaking engagements. <P>"I hope that my 

experience here can help invigorate people back home who may think war is inevitable 

and are losing hope," she says. <p align="center">&copy;2002 San Francisco Chronicle</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
