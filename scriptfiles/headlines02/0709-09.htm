HAVANA - Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said on Tuesday that President Bush was 

in a unique position to clean up corporate America because he had been an "irresponsible 

corporatist" himself a decade ago.

</font>"If it takes one to know one, he should be in a very experienced position 

to advocate a comprehensive corporate reform package and get it through Congress," 

Nader, the Green Party 2000 presidential candidate, told reporters on a visit 

to Cuba. 

<p> The president went to Wall Street on Tuesday to announce measures to make 

corporate officers more accountable and boost criminal penalties for corporate 

fraud in response to scandals that have shaken investor confidence. 

<p> Bush is facing questions about his integrity as a director of Texas-based 

Harken Energy Corp. a decade ago, when the company faced an inquiry by the Securities 

and Exchange Commission (SEC) for masking huge losses. Democrats in Congress have 

called for full publication of records of the SEC's 1992 investigation of Bush's 

trading in Harken shares. The SEC concluded he did not have access to insider 

information. 

<p> "Bush was an irresponsible corporatist with Harken Energy. He managed to sell 

his stock for hundreds of thousands of dollars two months before the bad news 

came out," Nader said. "He was on the audit committee. He was on the board of 

directors. He clearly knew about the bad news." 

<p> While Democrats have questioned Bush's qualifications for leading the charge 

against corporate corruption, Nader said the president was just the man for the 

job. "Coming out of the corporate world, having done some of these things, having 

associated with people like Kenny Boy -- Ken Lay of Enron -- he is in the best 

position possible to enact very fundamental structural systemic corporate reform, 

and unleash major prosecution against these companies and their bosses through 

the Justice Department and the SEC," Nader said.
