<p> For anyone who has watched the Bush administration during its first 19 months in office, what happened this week on Iraqi policy follows a familiar pattern: a strategic, if obvious, shift that takes the White House off the defensive and gives the president an opportunity to retake control of the agenda.</p>

    <p>White House officials argue that the decision to launch intensive consultations with Congress and U.S. allies about how to bring about the administration's goal of a regime change in Baghdad was neither a dramatic change of heart nor a sudden retreat in the face of two weeks of damaging coverage about internal divisions and charges of unilateralism.</p>

    <p>Others see a repeat of what happened earlier this year on the debate over whether to create a Department of Homeland Security or whether to make airport security screeners federal employees, when the administration embraced positions it had previously argued against.</p>

    <p> In this case, the administration's problems were partly of its own making. The internal divisions spilled into public view, and the president's hawkish statements alarmed European allies. Before administration officials were prepared to begin making their public case, public opinion was shifting away from them, and when Bush returned to Washington from Texas last weekend, he faced an entirely different political climate on Iraq than when he left.</p>

    <p>On Wednesday, the White House moved to contain the damage -- as it has done in the past. "They have consistently proven themselves willing to shift at the last moment when the tides are moving against them," said Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.).</p>

    <p>But Kerry, a probable presidential candidate in 2004, said that what preceded this week's moves were potentially consequential mistakes that could make it more difficult for the president to rally support for getting rid of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "They were way behind the curve in defining the nature of a real problem," he said, "and it has cost us in terms of our national security and our relationships needed to protect that security."</p>

    <p>It was only a few weeks ago that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, standing with Bush at the president's Texas ranch, dismissed news coverage suggesting the administration was moving toward war as "a frenzy." But this week's frenzy of attention to Iraq was entirely generated by a White House whose occupants returned from the August recess anxious and ready to push the debate to a new level.</p>

    <p>Why now? The same official put it this way yesterday: "From my perspective, because the president was ready."</p>

    <p>Administration officials said yesterday there was never any serious consideration given to avoid consulting Congress, despite an interpretation by White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales that Bush has all the authority he needs, from the 1991 resolution authorizing his father to go to war against Iraq, to mount a military campaign to depose Hussein.</p>

    <p>Though some White House officials {ndash} Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis Libby, among them {ndash} were privately squeamish about the idea of taking the case on Iraq to Congress, there was no significant opposition in the White House, officials said. "The inclination has always been to consult and we gave fairly serious indications of that," said a White House official.</p>

    <p> Although Bush has used the words "consultation" and "debate," senior officials repeatedly say he has not made up his mind yet on an Iraqi invasion, nor has he indicated what he might ask for in a congressional resolution.</p>

    <p>But in attempting to stipulate that they were under no obligation to seek a new resolution, the administration ceded the playing field to others, and brought rebukes upon themselves from such prominent Republicans as House International Relations Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde (Ill.) and Sen. John W. Warner (Va.), ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who urged Bush in blunt terms to embrace consultation.</p>

    <p>Gary J. Schmitt, director of the Project for the New American Century and an advocate of military action against Iraq, said the administration had a plausible case for not consulting but couldn't sustain it politically.</p>

    <p>"What happened to them was they didn't want to start talking about the case against Iraq, but that meant they left the field open for other people to make counter arguments," he said. "They concluded that we can't let this drift even if we're not ready to go to war. That dynamic caused them to change their game plan."</p>

    <p>More than that may have forced the administration's hand, however. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), another possible 2004 presidential candidate, said the administration's own rhetoric created a backlash that required a change in course.</p>

    <p>"They rattled sabers without explaining why," he told reporters yesterday, adding later, "They raised anxieties, alarmed those who oppose moving into Iraq and allowed the debate to get away from them."</p>

    <p>Lieberman, once an advocate for acting unilaterally, if necessary, now says the United States should not go it alone.</p>

    <p>What also drove the decision to move the debate to center stage was the pace of deliberations inside the administration about how next to proceed. Bush will speak at the United Nations on Thursday during a stay in New York to commemorate last year's terrorist attacks, an opportunity to lay out his case against Iraq.</p>

    <p>"It is time for the discussion and it's one that not only does the Congress deserve but the American people deserve," said Dan Bartlett, White House communications director. "The president understands that if he were to choose the ultimate action that we will do it with the full moral authority of the United States, and that requires the support of the people of the United States and the Congress."</p>

    <p>Kerry said the administration's challenge is great now as a result of its own mistakes. "They've crisscrossed the rhetorical landscape in a way that's left them with an unfocused rationale and created their own problem of credibility now on why it is they need to proceed," he said.</p>

    <p>But Sen. Fred D. Thompson (R-Tenn.) argued that there is plenty of time to make that case successfully. "The conversation got a little ahead of the rest of the process and gave [Bush's] statements a chance to become kind of an international punching bag for awhile," he said. "Now I think that they can more systematically sell their ideas."</p>
