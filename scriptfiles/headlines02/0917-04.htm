<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 — American and British warplanes patrolling Iraq's no-flight zones have recently shifted tactics to bombing major air defense sites in those areas, a move that could help clear air lanes for an allied attack, military officials said today. Meanwhile, the military is preparing to base B-2 bombers outside the United States for the first time, officials said.</p>

<P> As part of its effort to ratchet up pressure on Saddam Hussein, the United States has asked Britain to allow the bombers to use an air base on the tiny British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. That would reduce the flight distance to Baghdad to about 3,300 miles, from 6,800 miles.</p>

<P> The B-2's can carry 16 2,000-pound laser-guided bombs and the Air Force is preparing within the next few months to equip the aircraft to hold as many as 80 500-pound laser-guided bombs, which the Air Force is expected to stock in its arsenal within months, an Air Force official said today.</p>

<P> In response to almost daily Iraqi antiaircraft fire at allied planes patrolling the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that he had recently ordered warplanes to strike command-and-control sites, linked by Chinese-made fiber-optic networks, that guide the Iraqi surface-to-air missiles to their targets.</p>

<P> "I directed it," Mr. Rumsfeld told reporters. "I don't like the idea of our planes being shot at. The idea that our planes go out and get shot at with impunity bothers me."</p>

<P> In the last 10 days alone, allied warplanes have attacked five sites across southern Iraq, including an air defense communications installation near Tallil, 160 miles southeast of Baghdad, on Sunday.</p>

<P> While the total number of strikes against Iraqi targets this year is about the same as in past years, the focus of the attacks has changed.</p>

<P> Since the new tactics took effect, the military says, the strikes have weakened Iraq's air defenses, which unlike the rest of its military infrastructure, Baghdad has been able to rebuild largely to levels that existed before the Persian Gulf war.</p>

<P> "The recent strikes have degraded the air defense capabilities," said Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

<P> The American military is already stationing B-52 bombers at Diego Garcia. Mr. Rumsfeld and British officials declined to discuss any future deployments, but other officials said the Pentagon had asked Britain to allow the Air Force to erect portable, climate-controlled shelters for four to six B-2 bombers, which are normally based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.</p>

<P> The skin of the radar-evading planes is sensitive to heat, humidity and moisture, and the planes require a special hangar for maintenance. Air Force officials say the shelters take about a month to erect.</p>

<P> The deployment plans for the bat-winged B-2 were reported today in The Wall Street Journal. If they are realized, it will be the first time the planes, which cost about $2 billion each, will be based overseas for combat missions.</p>

<P> Stealthy B-2's would lead any military campaign to topple Mr. Hussein, and Iraq's formidable air defenses would be among their first targets. </p>

<P> Mr. Rumsfeld, however, declined to say today whether the change in tactics was essentially meant to lay the groundwork for an attack against Iraq, asserting that President Bush had not yet decided that.</p>

<P> The United States typically flies patrol missions over southern Iraq from Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. If American warplanes on routine patrol are fired on by Iraqi antiaircraft batteries, warplanes from Kuwait are usually called in to retaliate using a list of preapproved targets.</p>

<P> Until a few months ago, retaliatory strikes were typically made against Iraqi missile launchers, antiaircraft artillery emplacements or the radars used to cue them.</p>

<P> "It really did not make an awful lot of sense to be flying patterns that we were getting shot at if, in response, we were not doing any real damage that would make it worth putting pilots at risk," Mr. Rumsfeld said.</p>

<P> Under the new tactics, General Pace said, the retaliatory strikes are being directed at fixed targets like buildings, command-and-control centers and military airfields instead of mobile radars and other shifting targets.</p>

<P> Mr. Rumsfeld said he did not know how quickly Baghdad could repair command-and-control buildings and military airfields.</p>

<P> The commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, was scheduled to arrive in the gulf state of Qatar on Tuesday for a regional environmental conference. But in further evidence of American war preparations, American officials said General Franks would also meet with senior Qatari officials to discuss his plans to move a part of his headquarters in Tampa, Fla., to an airfield outside Doha, the Qatari capital.</p>

<P> About 600 planners under General Franks's command will move to Qatar in November. Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week that the vanguard would probably establish a forward headquarters, allowing General Franks to have a battle staff in place should Mr. Bush order an attack on Iraq later this year or early next.</p>

<P> Military officials also said about 2,000 marines would begin an amphibious assault exercise in Kuwait later this month. The biannual exercise is scheduled to last about a month and, like the shift in bombing tactics, could foreshadow an attack against Iraq, military officials said.</p>

<P> At the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld praised a top Saudi official for comments made on Sunday indicating that Saudi Arabia would let the United States use its military bases in a United Nations-backed attack on Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld said the Saudi remarks, which represented a shift, would intensify pressure on Iraq.</p>

<P> When a country like Saudi Arabia supports "what the president is doing and 

what we're trying to achieve in the Congress and the United Nations, that's helpful," 

he said.</p> </p>
