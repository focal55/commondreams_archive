WASHINGTON  - 

Most Americans believe the United

States should halt or reduce economic and military aid to

Israel if Prime Minister Ariel Sharon does not immediately

withdraw troops from Palestinian areas, according to a Time

Magazine/CNN poll released on Friday.

<p>

The poll of 1,003 adults also found most Americans back

Secretary of State Colin Powell's Mideast peace mission,

although they expect few results and consider Palestinian

leader Yasser Arafat a "terrorist" and an enemy of the U.S.

<p>

The public opinion sampling was conducted on Wednesday and

Thursday, before Powell arrived in Israel on Friday, when a

suicide bomber killed six people outside a Jerusalem market.

<p>

Sharon has rejected repeated direct calls by President Bush to withdraw troops from Palestinian areas, prompting some

critics to raise the possibility of sanctions.

<p>

But the administration has made clear it has no plans to

threaten key ally Israel with a cut in its &#36;3 billion in annual

aid. Even if it did, a strongly pro-Israel U.S. Congress likely

would oppose the move.

<p>

The Time/CNN poll found that 60 percent of Americans

favored the aid cut off if an Israeli troop withdrawal does not

take place immediately.

<p>

An even larger number -- 75 percent -- think Powell's

Mideast trip is a good idea but only 21 percent of the

respondents believe major progress toward peace will result.

<p>

As for Arafat, 59 percent of Americans consider him an

enemy of the United States, 62 percent think he's a terrorist

and 90 percent believe he cannot be trusted, according to the

poll.

<p>

Sharon's standing is better. One quarter of the respondents

consider him an enemy of the United States, 20 percent say he

is a terrorist and 65 percent do not trust him.

<p>

The poll found that 65 percent of Americans think Bush is

doing a good job handling foreign policy, a significant decline

from the 80 percent favorable rating he had in December 2001,

three months after the Sept. 11 attacks.

<p>

Fear of terrorism has declined. Last September, 45 percent

of the poll respondents identified terrorism as the main

problem facing the United States. That number declined to 25

percent in December and 21 percent this week.

<p>

The poll was conducted by Harris Interactive and has a

margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.</p>
