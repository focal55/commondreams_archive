<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->International concern about the human toll caused by Israel's continuing military offensive in the Palestinian West Bank is rising steeply amid reports of hundreds killed and rumors of summary executions and beatings of prisoners.

<p>

Hopes that the imminent arrival in Israel of United States Secretary of State Colin Powell would spur Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  to curtail operations sank Wednesday after a Palestinian suicide bomber blew up a bus in the northern port city of Haifa, killing at least eight people.

</table></font>Sharon's security cabinet reportedly reaffirmed its decision to continue the offensive in a meeting after the bombing and later sent tanks and soldiers into Bir Zeit, north of occupied Ramallah, even as Powell joined his colleagues from the European Union (EU) and Russia at a meeting in Madrid in calling for Israel "to halt immediately" its military operations.

<p>







That demand was backed by a coalition of European relief and labor groups, Solidar, which, while condemning "unreservedly" the attacks on Israeli civilians, called on the EU to suspend trade preferences to Israel until the occupation of Palestinian territory ends. Echoing a number of United Nations agencies, the coalition also urged the EU to "take the lead in demanding an international presence in the Middle East" in order to reduce the level of violence there.

<p>







In two statements released Wednesday, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a> condemned the suicide bombing, noting "that even the gravest human rights abuses do not justify the deliberate retaliation or targeting of civilians." At the same time, however, it expressed fears about abuses by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), especially in Jenin, where it said 200 people had been killed over the last several days.

<p>







"We fear that the gravest abuses against the Palestinian population are taking place behind closed doors as humanitarian agencies and the media are being barred access to most of the Occupied Territories...Families whose relatives have been arrested often do not know if they are alive or dead. Reports of extrajudicial executions cannot be verified," the London-based group said, repeating its previous call for human rights observers to be deployed throughout the West Bank.

<p>







Local human rights groups were busy Wednesday trying to get their own picture of what was taking place in the Palestinian towns and cities which have come under attack since Sharon launched his offensive following a suicide bombing on a Passover dinner at a hotel in Netanya which killed more than 20 Israelis March 27.

<p>







Palestinian human rights groups said Wednesday they had received reports that an undetermined number of Palestinian fighters in the Jenin refugee camp had been summarily executed after trying to surrender to the IDF. Jenin has been the site of the most unrelenting resistance to the IDF, 13 of whose soldiers were killed Tuesday in an ambush.

<p>







The <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org/" target="_new">Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment</a> also said it had received reports from witnesses leaving the camp of bodies of residents that appeared to have been run over by military bulldozers and others within the rubble of their homes. It estimated that 30 percent of the total area of the camp, including homes and other buildings, had been destroyed.

<p>







<a href="http://www.btselem.org" target="_new">B'Tselem</a>, Israel's foremost rights watchdog active in the occupied territories, released a report Wednesday summarizing some of the specific incidents which have taken place, adding, however, that, in most cases, its fieldworkers were unable to reach the victims and eyewitnesses to collect testimonies in person.

<p>







Among the cases were the deaths of two Palestinian men returning from morning prayers when a missile was shot from a helicopter. Their bodies were taken to a nearby house, which was also hit in the attack, but neither they nor those injured in the house were evacuated due to IDF curbs on the movement of ambulances.

<p>







In another case reported by B'Tselem, a 30-year-old Nablus man was shot and killed five meters from the road and in plain view of nearby IDF soldiers. When another unidentified Palestinian tried to evacuate the body, he was detained by soldiers, who beat him, took off his clothes and took him away. When the Palestinian Red Crescent Society tried to remove the body Tuesday, they were shot at by the IDF which finally allowed the group to evacuate it Wednesday evening.

<p>







Seven IDF soldiers were also reported to be patrolling one village near Nablus where each day they have chosen a house at random and thrown shock and tear-gas grenades into it. On Tuesday, the same group reportedly stopped passers by and beat them at a cafe in the village center.

<p>







B'Tselem also reported that at least 1,000 Palestinian detainees were being held in Ofer military camp and another 1,000 to 1,500 in Megiddo military prison, as well as dozens more in jails throughout the West Bank.

<p>







Detainees released from the Ofer camp had reported extremely overcrowded conditions with insufficient space even to sleep, inadequate food supplies, beatings, and humiliation. Human rights groups have tried to gain access to the facilities, but on Sunday Israel's highest court rejected a petition requesting permission to visit Ofer.

<p>







"This report paints only a partial picture and does not necessarily reflect the worst of the human rights violations being perpetrated," the Israeli group said.
