BOSTON --

With a bleak assessment of the health of the planet, the president of 

the nation's largest scientific organization opened its 168th annual meeting 

here with a ringing call for conservation of resources and expanded use of 

renewable energy.

<P>In remarks prepared for delivery yesterday evening, Peter Raven, president 

of the <a href="http://www.aaas.org/" target="_new">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, warned that the 

affluent lifestyle of Western society is increasingly unsustainable and 

unattainable for most of the world's teeming population of 6.1 billion.

<P>"We have become accustomed to thinking of the world as a place in which 

everyone could eventually become rich," he said. "This may be so, but it 

cannot happen using the technologies we possess now, and building to 

industrialized-world levels of consumption everywhere."

<P>Raven, who is director of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, said 

it is urgent that the United States reduce dependence on "both foreign and 

domestic sources of oil, coal and natural gas," and that the country put a 

priority on conservation and the use of alternative energy such as wind, solar 

and geothermal power.

<P>Raven singled out for particularly harsh criticism Danish statistician 

Bjorn Lomborg, whose recent book, "The Skeptical Environmentalist," argues 

that the global environment is improving, not deteriorating. 

Environmentalists' arguments to the contrary, Lomborg argues, are ill informed.

<P>Raven said that the success of Lomborg's book "demonstrates the 

vulnerability of the scientific process -- which is deliberative and 

hypothesis driven -- to outright misrepresentation and distortion."

<P>". . . It is difficult to understand why Cambridge University Press 

published his book, or why the justifiably respected and useful journal like 

the Economist would rush to his defense."

<P>Raven painted a picture of the human species at once blossoming and 

plundering the globe's resources, setting the stage for enormous biological 

extinctions on a scale not seen since the end of the Cretaceous Period.

<P>"We can see that the world has been converted in an instant of time from a 

wild, natural one to one in which human beings, one of an estimated 10 million 

species of organisms, are consuming, wasting or diverting an estimated 45 

percent of the total net biological productivity on land and using more than 

half of the renewable fresh water."

<P>With world population projected to grow by 3 billion in 50 years, he said, 

"We clearly will have an increasingly difficult time in maintaining our 

current levels of affluence."

<P>Science, he maintained, still has the solutions for a sustainable society. 

Raven said that industrialized nations must combat ignorance with education 

and attend to the growing gap between rich and poor nations. The model for a 

sustainable society, he said, was laid out during another time of national 

crisis, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, when he delivered his famed "Four 

Freedoms" address of Jan. 6, 1941.

<P>Raven said Roosevelt's call for freedom of speech, freedom of worship, 

freedom from want and freedom from fear needed to be re-embraced by global 

leaders of both public and private institutions.

<P>A sustainable future will depend, said Raven, on "a new industrial 

revolution" that uses science to address issues of overconsumption, 

overpopulation and the development of "appropriate technologies."

<P>His remarks opened the 168th annual meeting of the organization, which was 

founded in 1848 and this year is drawing 5,000 scientists from across the 

country in a rare blending of multiple research disciplines.

<P>An enormously diverse array of programs, spanning biology, earth science, 

medicine and astrophysics, is offered in hopes that all this brainpower drawn 

together can draw new insights by exposure to different disciplines. It is 

also a bit of a party, where top researchers socialize and recall their 

laboratory triumphs and challenging days as graduate students.

<P>The meeting is a snapshot of what our technological society has become, 

where it has been and where it is going -- a long strange trip from the first 

session, which was held the year gold was discovered in California.
