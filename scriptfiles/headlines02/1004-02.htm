<p>In one of his most impassioned speeches during his 50 years in Congress, Sen. 

Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., pleaded with fellow senators on Thursday not to issue 

a “blank check” to President George W. Bush.</p>

<p>“The president is using the Oval Office as a bully pulpit to sound the call 

to arms. But it is from Capitol Hill that such orders must flow. The people, through 

their elected representatives, must make that decision,” Byrd said.</p>

<p>Quoting Roman historian Titus Livius, Byrd called Bush “blind and improvident....</p>

<p>“As sure as the sun rises in the east, we are embarking on a course of action 

with regard to Iraq that, in its haste, is both blind and improvident. We are 

rushing into war without fully discussing why, without thoroughly considering 

the consequences, or without making any attempt to explore what steps we might 

take to avert conflict.” </p>

<p>The “bellicose stance” taken in Bush’s resolution, sent to the Senate 33 days 

before Election Day, is motivated by campaign politics, Byrd argued.</p>

<p>“Before risking the lives of American troops, all members of Congress, Democrats 

and Republicans alike, must overcome the siren song of political polls and focus 

strictly on the merits, not the politics, of this most serious issue.”</p>

<p>Immediately after Byrd sat down, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said, “He has 

been a voice of sanity and reason. He has been a voice the American people wanted 

to hear....</p>

<p>“When our president didn’t want to come to Congress, Sen. Byrd stood up and 

said, ‘Just a moment. Read the Constitution. The Congress shall have the power 

to declare war,’” Boxer said. “I cannot support a blank check. It would be an 

affront to the people of this country to do that.”</p>

<p>Bush defended himself Thursday, saying his resolution would affirm his right 

to use pre-emptive military strikes only as a last resort.</p>

<p>Byrd called the Bush resolution “a product of haste ... a product of presidential 

hubris. This resolution is breathtaking in its scope. It redefines the nature 

of defense, and reinterprets the Constitution to suit the will of the Executive 

Branch.</p>

<p>“It would give the president blanket authority to launch a unilateral pre-emptive 

attack on a sovereign nation that is perceived to be a threat to the United States. 

This is an unprecedented and unfounded interpretation of the president’s authority 

under the Constitution, not to mention the fact that it stands the charter of 

the United Nations on its head,” Byrd said. </p>

<p>Last month, the Congressional Research Service issued a report noting the 1962 

Cuban Missile Crisis “represented a threat situation which some may argue had 

elements more parallel to those presented by Iraq today. But it was resolved without 

a ‘pre-emptive’ military attack by the United States.”</p>

<p>Bush argues the Joint Resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force, 

passed in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, authorizes him to initiate military 

actions on his own.</p>

<p>Byrd called Bush’s argument “a cynical twisting of words.... Nowhere was there 

an implied recognition of inherent authority under the Constitution to ‘deter 

and prevent’ future acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>“Other nations will be able to hold up the United States as the model to justify 

their military adventures. Do you not think that India and Pakistan, China and 

Taiwan, Russia and Georgia are closely watching the outcome of this debate?” Byrd 

asked.</p>

<p>“A war against Iraq will affect thousands if not tens of thousands of lives, 

and perhaps alter the course of history. It will surely affect the balance of 

power in the Middle East. It is not a decision to be taken in haste,” Byrd said. 

“Yet that is exactly what the Senate is proposing to do.”</p>

<p>Byrd said the White House failed to establish any concrete ties between Iraq 

and al-Qaida.</p>

<p>“We know who was behind the Sept. 11 attacks,” Byrd said. “We know it was Osama 

bin Laden and his al-Qaida terrorist network. We have dealt with al-Qaida and 

with the Taliban government that sheltered it. We have routed them from Afghanistan 

and we are continuing to pursue them in hiding....</p>

<p>“No one in the administration has been able to produce any solid evidence linking 

Iraq to the Sept. 11 attack,” Byrd said.</p>

<p>Byrd also warned that Saddam, “ruthless in gaining and staying in power,” is 

likely to use all weapons at his disposal if attacked.</p>

<p>“Iraq is not Afghanistan, impoverished by decades of war, internal strife, 

and stifling religious oppression. Though its military forces are much diminished,... 

it is a large country that has spent years on a wartime footing, and it still 

has some wealth.”</p>

<p>And even a successful attack could lead to a long-term, expensive occupation 

of a nation so religiously and ethnically divided.</p>

<p>“If the Congress authorizes such a mission, we must be prepared for what will 

follow,” Byrd said. “Nation-building cannot be accomplished with the wave of a 

wand by some fairy godmother.”</p>

<p>Byrd criticized Bush for providing no detailed estimates of the costs of war, 

including the cost in human lives.</p>

<p>“The questions surrounding the wisdom of declaring war on Iraq are many and 

serious. The answers are too few and too glib. This is no way to embark on war.”</p>

<p>Byrd again said the United Nations is the “proper forum” to search for and 

destroy Iraq’s weapons. “If Iraq again chooses to interfere with such an ongoing 

and admittedly intrusive inspection regime, then and only then should the United 

States, with the support of the world, take stronger measures....</p>

<p>“Let us guard against the perils of haste, lest the Senate fall prey to the 

dangers of taking action that is both blind and improvident.”</p>
