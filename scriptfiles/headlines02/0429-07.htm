It looks like a North Atlantic salmon. But it grows seven times faster, and it's much more attractive to the opposite sex than a normal salmon.

<P>It's a transgenic fish, the first genetically engineered animal under 

review for the U.S. food supply. Embedded in every cell of its body are genes 

from the Chinook salmon and the ocean pout fish that make it grow more quickly.

<P>The altered salmon is likely to become the next focus in the battle over 

bioengineered food, after controversies over the desirability of genetically 

altered bovine growth hormones in cows and modified corn, soybeans and canola 

in cereals and tortilla chips.

<P>In the next year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will consider a 

petition by Aqua Bounty Farms of Waltham, Mass., to farm and market the 

altered salmon.

<P>Already, the prospect of mutant fish escaping and disrupting already 

threatened wild populations has prompted lawmakers in several states to take 

pre-emptive steps. California could become the first state to ban transgenic 

fish outright.

<P>Last week, the Senate Natural Resources Committee approved a bill by Sen. 

Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, that would make it illegal to import, transport, 

possess or release transgenic fish. They would be considered an "aquatic 

nuisance," a category that includes piranhas, slugs and giant toads that 

threaten wildlife.

<P>Another bill by Assemblywoman Virginia Strom-Martin, D-Duncan Mills, would 

require labeling of transgenic fish sold in markets. And a joint legislative 

resolution introduced by Assemblyman Joe Nation, D-San Rafael, urges the FDA 

to deny Aqua Bounty's petition and put in place a moratorium on transgenic 

fish.

<P><b>'FRANKENFISH' CONDEMNED</b>

<P>The bills -- and Sher's in particular -- have strong support from consumer, 

environmental and commercial fishing groups, which dub the altered salmon a 

"Frankenfish" that would eat or outcompete smaller wild species and cause 

their extinction. What's more, critics say, federal regulatory oversight of 

bio-engineered foods is not sufficient to guarantee the fish are safe to eat.

<P>Proponents of biotechnology, on the other hand, view transgenic fish as the 

answer to supplying consumers with healthful fish without depleting the 

ocean's declining populations. To fish farmers, it means being able to grow 

salmon in half the time and at lower feed costs.

<P>Sher's bill could abruptly end these hopes. Biotechnology trade groups, the 

National Food Processors Association, the state Chamber of Commerce, 

California Farm Bureau and the California Grocers Association oppose the 

legislation.

<P>Passing a strict anti-transgenic fish state law would create "a precedent, 

and could poison the well. Once the door is shut, we may never be able to find 

the key to open it up again," said George Gough, a Sacramento lobbyist for 

Monsanto Co.

<P>He urges legislators to leave it up to the FDA, which must consult with 

federal wildlife and fisheries agencies, to decide whether the bio-engineered 

salmon is safe.

<P>"This is really the first biotech animal that is going through the review 

process. The FDA is going to be taking a microscope to this, and it should. 

When you you say 'fish' or 'beef,' it hits you more than when you say 'soybean,

' " he said.

<P>While Monsanto doesn't work with fish, it's one of the largest producers of 

transgenic crops, holding dozens of patents on new biotech products, among 

them soybeans, potatoes, canola and corn. The company believes a California 

ban would have a chilling effect on the industry and investors.

<P>Opponents of biotechnology say a pre-emptive strike is crucial. About two 

dozen varieties of genetically engineered fish or shellfish are under 

development, most aimed at increasing growth and resistance to disease in such 

species as abalone, oysters, stripped bass, rainbow trout, catfish and tilapia.

<P><b>THREAT TO NATURAL RESOURCES</b>

<P>"These genetically engineered fish will pose a threat to our natural 

resources," said Natasha Benjamin, program officer with the Institute for 

Fisheries Resources, a research arm of the Pacific Coast Federation of 

Fishermen's Associations.

<P>"California is known to set a precedent when it comes to environmental 

standards. We hope to see the state take the lead in this issue, and hopefully 

other states will follow," she said.

<P>At the crux of the debate is whether the superfish would escape into the 

wild and harm native salmon populations. Damaged by dams, pollution, invasive 

species and loss of fresh water, salmon are already struggling for 

sustainability on the Pacific Coast.

<P>A 1999 study by Purdue University scientists predicted ecological risks 

from the release of transgenic fish into the wild.

<P>The researchers found the larger transgenic fish were more attractive mates 

for native fish, thus allowing a trait to spread quickly through the wild 

population. But because the offspring don't live long, eventually the native 

population would be wiped out.

<P>The study caused widespread concern because in aquaculture, the escape of 

farmed fish is inevitable.

<P><b>TRANSGENIC FISH LAWS</b>

<P>Last year, Maryland passed a law prohibiting transgenic fish any place that 

might connect with waterways. In Oregon, the law prohibits the release of 

transgenic fish into locations where they can mingle with wild populations. 

There are discussions in Alaska over an outright ban.

<P>Representatives of Aqua Bounty Farms say its modified Atlantic salmon won't 

threaten wild stocks. The company will use only sterile females in netted pens, so, if they escape, they won't spawn and pass along the genetic traits.

<P>Joseph McGonigle, vice president of Aqua Bounty, said the technique that 

his company uses to sterilize eggs "is 100 percent effective. We will be doing 

. . . screening on every batch of eggs that is done."

<P>But fish scientists, including some from the aquaculture industry, say 

there is still a chance that a small percentage of fish will be fertile. And 

they predict another problem: Wild male salmon will try to mate with the 

larger but sterile female salmon, depressing reproduction rates.

<P>Aquaculture is the fastest growing segment of agriculture, according to the 

U.S. Department of Agriculture. In California, sales of farmed fish and 

shellfish have jumped from $33 million a year in 1991 to $71 million in 1999 

from more than 100 producers.

<P>"The majority of our producers are not involved in transgenics. What we're 

grappling with is that there may be some transgenic techniques that are proven 

safe that would be excluded by this bill," said Justin Malan, executive 

director of the California Aquaculture Association.

<P>The trade group is negotiating with the bill's author to change the 

language. One of the aquaculture industry's problems is that the bill shuts 

out all commercial ventures.

<P>"It's a question of whether the importation of transgenic fish should be 

banned or adequately regulated," Malan said. "We don't have a problem with 

stipulations that will safeguard the environment or public health, but a ban 

is forever."</p>
