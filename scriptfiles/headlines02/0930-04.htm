<p> Leaders of the Washington State Democratic Party have voted unanimously to 

condemn a unilateral attack on Iraq or a war to force a regime change in that 

country without congressional approval.</p>

<p>Party Chairman Paul Berendt said state Democrats overwhelmingly believe the 

Bush administration is railroading the American people into a war that has not 

been adequately justified. </p>

<p>The vote, with all 102 state committee delegates approving a resolution of 

condemnation, came Saturday in Yakima.</p>

<p>"In eight years as (state party) chairman, there has been nothing that has 

made people more angry or passionate than the possibility of this war," Berendt 

said. "People feel that it's time to speak out and be heard. </p>

<p>"The fear is the Congress will act and we will be heading down this path before 

there is a real debate among the American people. The feeling is that left unchecked, 

the president is going to go way too far.</p>

<p>"We are not unreasonable. With the information that we have now, we are asking 

them to oppose the action in Iraq. We are not sympathetic with the leadership 

of Iraq, but we think that Bush needs to take a deep breath, instead of just jamming 

it through."</p>

<p>The strongly worded resolution harshly criticizes President Bush's foreign 

policy for an apparent preference for force over diplomacy as a means of resolving 

international disputes, and for lacking a plan to rebuild the Iraqi government. 

</p>

<p>It asserts that the Bush administration has offered no concrete evidence that 

there is no alternative to war, and implores Washington's elected Democrats to 

oppose any declaration of war that does not address their complaints. </p>

<p>"More and more people view this as some kind of cowboy action instead of an 

action that is in the best interest of the American people," Berendt said. </p>

<p>While opinion among Washington's congressional delegation generally follows 

party lines, there are variations among members. Rep. Jim McDermott, a Seattle 

Democrat, strongly opposes a U.S. war against Iraq while Rep. Norm Dicks, a Democrat 

representing Pierce and Kitsap counties, has been a consistent backer of military 

intervention. </p>

<p>Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen has asked Bush for more specific information on 

why a preemptive military strike is necessary. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said last night that she is still 

reviewing the proposed resolution Congress will begin debating this week.</p>

<p>"Senator Murray believes Saddam Hussein is a menace and the appropriate course 

is to consult with our allies" before deciding on an action, spokesman Todd Webster 

said. </p>

<p>Rep. Jennifer Dunn, an Eastside Republican, has been a strong backer of Bush. 

But even she had some concerns about the cost of sending troops to Iraq. </p>

<p>But those evaporated last week, Dunn's spokeswoman Jennifer Burita, said after 

Dunn had a classified briefing from CIA Director George Tenet and National Security 

Adviser Condoleezza Rice.</p> </p>
