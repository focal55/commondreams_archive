<p>JOHANNESBURG - With just two weeks before the start of the <a href="http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/" target="_new">World 

Summit on Sustainable Development</a>, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan 

has sent world leaders a letter strongly encouraging their active participation 

at the summit in Johannesburg.

<p> "Your presence would send a strong message of global solidarity and signal 

commitment at the highest level to a sustainable future for all," the Secretary-General 

wrote. 

<p> To date, 106 heads of state and heads of government have indicated that they 

will attend the high level segment of the conference September 2-4, but U.S. President 

George W. Bush is not among them. 

<p> In his letter, Annan told the leaders that the summit will be an opportunity 

to reinvigorate a global commitment to sustainable development and to maintain 

the positive momentum generated at the World Trade Organization meeting in Doha, 

Qatar, and the UN's International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, 

Mexico. 

<p> South Africa has so far raised 80 percent of the money needed to host the 

summit the Johannesburg World Summit Company (Jowsco) has announced. 

<p> The official summit opens at the Sandton Convention Center August 26 and concludes 

on September 4. The total budget is estimated at R550 million (&#36;US55 million), 

of which the South African government is expected to contribute R200 million (US&#36;20 

million). 

<p> Jowsco CEO Moss Mashishi told reporters at the National Press Club in Pretoria 

last week that contributions from governments and private corporations were "looking 

quite good" in terms of initial predictions, but he did not give exact figures. 

<p> Mashishi said, "We just had advance team briefings which were attended by 

109 countries - a pretty high number." 

<p> About 6,000 delegates are expected to attend the official UN meeting. An estimated 

5,000 media representatives will cover the event, according to the South African 

Press Association. About 10,000 representatives of nine key interest groups will 

also get accreditation to enter the official conference at Sandton. 

<p> Another 15,000 people are expected to attend a civil society conference at 

the Nasrec Expo Center south of Johannesburg, while 800 business people will gather 

for a forum at Sandton's Hilton hotel. 

<p> At least 500 events parallel to the summit are planned in an around Johannesburg, 

from arts exhibits and cultural performances to a Water Dome based close to the 

official conference center. Sponsored by the Africa Water Task Force and endorsed 

by African Water Ministers, the Water Dome will be active from August 29 through 

September 2. It aims to create water awareness by allowing all stakeholders to 

showcase their water related activities, policies, initiatives, new technologies, 

and products. 

<p> If participants at the World Summit on Sustainable Development ever feel they 

have lost touch with the world outside the meeting, a Virtual Exhibit webcast 

during the summit will restore the connection, bringing real world problems and 

solutions to the Sandton Convention Center. 

<p> The exhibit will allow live links to sustainable development projects all 

across the globe, and will allow people at the summit - presidents, prime ministers, 

leaders of nongovernmental organization and businesses - to talk to people in 

the field. Anyone with access to the Internet, anywhere, can watch. Johannesburg 

Summit Secretary-General Nitin Desai has called Johannesburg "the first truly 

interactive world summit." 

<p> "We hope to bring the world to Johannesburg. We want to make the thousands 

of summit delegates aware that there are people in the field doing innovative 

things in the pursuit of sustainable development and give those people a chance 

to participate in the summit process." 

<p> Local governments from all over the world will make their views known at a 

four day session August 27 to 30. More than 500 mayors and representatives of 

local authority associations will meet in the summit district of Sandton during 

the first week of the event to challenge summit delegates and agreements. 

<p> About half of the world's population, an estimated 2.7 billion people, live 

in urban areas. Increasing fossil fueled transport, declining water and air quality 

as well as poverty and unemployment are issues challenging local governments throughout 

the world today. 

<p> A strategic plan known as "Local Action 21" is planned to be launched at the 

end of the local government session in Johannesburg. It will be presented by the 

local government representatives in concert with the United Nations Development 

Programme (UNDP). 

<p> "Local authorities are already moving from agenda to action - despite the 

difficulties," reports Konrad Otto-Zimmermann, secretary general of the International 

Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), the association leading the 

local government preparations for Johannesburg. 

<p> The main obstacles - the lack of access to financial resources, the inflexibility 

of tax structures, weak decision making power, and lack of capacity - have continued 

to keep local governments from exploiting their high potential to address key 

sustainable development issues. 

<p> Still, in Johannesburg local governments will be highlighting their accomplishments 

since the last UN environment and development summit, in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. 

Since then more than 6,000 municipalities worldwide have addressed issues of sustainable 

development within Local Agenda 21 processes agreed at the Rio summit. 

<p> "Achievements on the local level could be even more impressive, if cities 

did not face so many obstacles in taking local action," says Otto-Zimmermann. 

<p> UNDP Administrator Mark Malloch Brown expressed his conviction that local 

governments will play a key role in Johannesburg. "Only if we succeed in convincing 

national governments and organizations that the crucial and heaviest workload 

for sustainable development is to be done at the local level, do we have a chance 

at leading the summit to a successful end."
