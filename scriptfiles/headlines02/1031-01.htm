<p>Thousands of people were today expected to take part in a series of demonstrations 

up and down Britain to protest against military action on Iraq.

<P>The <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/" target="_new">Stop the War</a> umbrella 

group was hoping for "the largest protest of direct action and disobedience there 

has been in Britain for decades", with mini-protests, sit-downs and occupations 

"from Beccles to Bournemouth, Canterbury to Aberdeen".

<P>The spark for today's day of action came from comments made by Tony Benn last 

summer. 

<P>In a departure from his normal aversion to civil disobedience as a form of 

protest, the former Labour cabinet minister said: "Non-violent resistance to the 

government will show they cannot do this in our name. We should stop the buses, 

stop the trains, stop the schools." 

<P>Following last month's Stop the War march in London, attended by up to 400,000 

protesters, the group has called on supporters to organize their own local acts 

of civil disobedience. It advocates three forms of protest: 

<P><B>&#183;</B> Meetings in or near the workplace with anti-war speakers, perhaps 

with a local march <BR>

&#149: College occupations and teach-ins <BR>

<B>&#183;</B> Evening protests in town centers, where demonstrators are urged 

by Stop the War to sit down and block traffic.

<P>In London, protesters will rally at Parliament Square, as MPs leave the Commons 

for their constituencies at the end of the parliamentary working week.

<P>Stop the War has called for all protests to be peaceful and urged demonstrators 

to bring banners, whistles, drums and candles.
