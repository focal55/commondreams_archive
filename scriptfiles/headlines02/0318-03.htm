When Noam Chomsky takes the stage today at the University of San 

Francisco to give a speech titled "Human Rights: Global Change and Continuity,

" he'll be greeted by an audience that sees him as the antidote to U.S. 

leaders who back the military campaign in Afghanistan and want to expand the 

war on terrorism to Iraq and other countries.

</table>Chomsky, the noted MIT linguistics professor who is best known for his 

scathing critiques of U.S. foreign policy, says the United States itself was 

practicing terrorism when it bombed Afghanistan and forced the Taliban from 

power. And it was terrorism, Chomsky says, when President Bush -- without 

publicly providing conclusive proof, and without going to an international 

court of law -- decided he wanted Osama bin Laden "dead or alive."

<P>"By the U.S. definition, those are textbook illustrations of international 

terrorism, which is the use of force or violence to attain political ends 

(and) the targeting of civilians through intimidation and fear," Chomsky said 

in a weekend phone interview from his Massachusetts home, before flying to the 

Bay Area to make a weeklong series of talks.

<P>Since Sept. 11, Chomsky has been deluged with requests to speak at 

universities, fund-raisers and public forums. He published a best-selling book, "9-11," which explains -- in a series of interviews with journalists -- his 

view that the United States is "a leading terrorist state" that circumvents 

international law and wrongfully supports murderous conditions around the 

world, whether it's in Iraq, the Palestinian territories, Nicaragua or 

Indonesia.

<P>"Right now, the United States is asking Turkey to become the international 

military force in Afghanistan," said Chomsky. "Well, what's Turkey? In the 

1990s, funded almost completely by the Clinton administration, atrocities 

increased (in Kurdish areas of Turkey) -- to the point that (up to 3 million) 

refugees were driven out and maybe 50,000 people were killed and thousands of 

villages were destroyed. That's U.S. terrorism in the 1990s. I'm not talking 

about ancient history. And now Turkey is being asked to supervise the 'war on 

terrorism?' If some Martian observer were looking at this, he'd crack up in 

ridicule."

<P>Critics say Chomsky is reflexively anti-American, and publications as 

varied as the New Republic and the Weekly Standard have derided his post-Sept. 

11 comments, especially remarks Chomsky made last November in Pakistan's 

capital, when he reportedly told an audience, "The coalition forces are making 

plans to further destroy the hunger-stricken country (of Afghanistan). The 

consequences of their crimes will never be known and they are quite confident 

about that."

<P>Under the title of "Paging Jane Fonda," the New Republic wrote that Chomsky 

"appeared in Islamabad to peddle his by now banal theories of American 

malfeasance" and that, "At the end of his speech, the audience of 1,500 gave 

Chomsky a standing ovation. He'd doubtless receive a similarly warm reception 

in Kandahar."

<P>Chomsky dismisses his critics as "commissars," saying he takes their put-

downs "for granted. It's been done throughout history. How were dissidents 

treated in the Soviet Union? Let's look at the First World War. The first 

thing that happened as the war opened was that 93 leading German intellectuals 

issued a proclamation requesting that intellectuals all over the world support 

Germany's noble war effort. On the Anglo-American side, exactly the same thing 

happened. There were a couple of dissidents, like (author and philosopher) 

Bertrand Russell and (Socialist presidential candidate) Eugene Debs in the 

United States -- and, yes, they ended up in jail."

<P>His speech in Islamabad, Chomsky points out, was arranged by Pakistan's 

Eqbal Ahmad Foundation, "and Eqbal Ahmad was the leading opponent of religious 

fundamentalism and nuclear armament in Pakistan. He was also the leading 

proponent of democracy. That's who I was speaking for -- for the group of 

people who are radically opposed to Islamic fundamentalism. The liberal press 

(in the United States) presented it as if I was somehow giving a pro-Taliban 

speech."

<P>Tomorrow and Wednesday, Chomsky will give speeches on linguistics at UC 

Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall. Then he'll talk Thursday night at the Berkeley 

Community Theatre in a benefit for the Middle East Children's Alliance, and 

Friday night at the Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto in a sold-out discussion 

sponsored by the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center. Chomsky's Thursday night 

speech is titled "Middle East Peace in a 9-11 World," and his Friday night 

speech is titled "Peering Into the Abyss of the Future." All of his talks, 

including today's, will touch on Afghanistan and a war against terrorism that 

he says is morally unfair and misdirected.

<P>Since Sept. 11, Chomsky says, his speeches have been more heavily attended 

than ever, and his views have been disseminated more than ever.

<P>"It's not just me, incidentally," Chomsky said. "It's everybody. There's 

probably been more openness and dissent now than at any time in modern history.
