Palestinian sources yesterday emphatically denied Israeli claims that armed Palestinian gunmen taking sanctuary in Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity are holding hostages. However, four priests who were allowed to leave the compound on Friday said that they had been forcefully held by the gunmen. Dozens of priests and several nuns are still inside the church compound.

</table>The Palestinian sources said most of the armed men inside the church were members of the Palestinian police and National Security Force who had entered the church to take refuge and not with the aim of holding hostages.

<p>Colonel Marcel Aviv, commander of Israeli forces surrounding the church said Friday that senior Palestinian officials, including the governor of Bethlehem and the head of the General Intelligence Services in the city were also inside the church. He said that the army's aim is to end the operation with all persons currently in the church, outside and unarmed, without harming the holy site.

<p>Meanwhile, Roman Catholic officials have put forward a proposal to to end the standoff at the Church of the Nativity, Vatican sources said yesterday. However, an official Vatican statement said there was no "plan of the Holy See" to end the stalemate.

<p>One source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the proposal had been made after the standoff began five days ago and has been renewed regularly. Another well-informed Church source said that a proposal aimed to "provide for the armed men who are in the Holy place improperly to end this improper presence while guaranteeing their safety and dignity and without any danger thereby to the Israelis".

<p>Father David Jaeger, spokesman for the Franciscan custodians of Roman Catholic sites in the Holy Land said on Friday that the Franciscans feared the Israeli army was trying to legitimize an "imminent" attack on the Church of Nativity by declaring the friars inside to be hostages.

<p>"There are allegations that the Israeli army has decided to consider the Franciscan Friars at the Shrine of the Nativity in Bethlehem as hostages," Jaeger, currently in Rome, said. "It is impossible not to fear that the use of this term is meant in an effort to legitimize a perhaps imminent military assault," he said.
