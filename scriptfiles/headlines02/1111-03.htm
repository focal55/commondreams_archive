<p>Countries taking part in talks on strengthening a global ban on germ warfare were urged to consider a "rescue operation" to break a deadlock since the United States withdrew from the last round of negotiations almost a year ago.</p>

<p>As the review conference on the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) re-opened here, the chairman, Tibor Toth of Hungary, introduced a compromise proposal dropping any explicit mention of the verification measures which the US had opposed.</p>

<p>"This is a rescue operation, because this effort is more limited," Toth later told journalists.</p>

<p>The 146 countries that have ratified the BWC have been trying to strengthen it for the past seven years to try to keep pace with the progress in biotechnology. </p>

<p>That update included considering verification through on-site inspections in participating countries.</p>

<p>The existing convention bans the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological weapons, but did not include measures to check on possible illicit germ warfare production when it was concluded 30 years ago.</p>

<p>Any changes need to be agreed by all the countries in the BWC.</p>

<p>At the previous round of the review conference last December, the US publicly 

vetoed moves supported by many of the other countries in the BWC to set up a system 

of independent inspections of laboratories and defense facilities.</p>

<p>The talks had been suspended since then. </p>

<p>Experts have warned of an urgent need to move ahead with strengthening the treaty amid growing worldwide fears about the possibility of germ warfare attacks since September 11.</p>

<p>Toth told delegates his "draft decision" was the only realistic way ahead.</p>

<p>It aimed to keep more restricted talks alive through a series of annual meetings of signatories until the next review scheduled in 2006, he said.</p>

<p>"We cannot pretend that the political differences between delegations are not serious," Toth told the conference.</p>

<p>His timetable does cover other areas related to strengthening the Convention which most countries, including the US, have supported in the past.</p>

<p>They include the examination of a code of conduct for scientists, national 

measures to improve security of laboratories, boosted surveillance of infectious 

diseases, as well as national legislation to criminalize the possession of biological 

agents.</p>

<p>"What is important is that the US remains engaged in the discussion that is going on right now," said Jayantha Dhanapala, the United Nations under-secretary general for disarmament affairs.</p>

<p>Toth said he was adjourning the conference until late Tuesday to give governments a chance to examine the proposal. He said he hoped to wind up the conference swiftly if they agreed.</p>

<p>Other countries, including Iraq, North Korea, China and Iran, also have qualms about an inspection regime, according to observers.</p>

<p>US officials said last year that they felt intrusive, independent inspections 

at defense laboratories or private biotechnology laboratories would jeopardize 

national security, and provide little in return.</p>

<p>"This was a terrible mistake and it's going to take a long time to rectify it," Malcolm Dando, an expert on biological weapons control at Britain's Bradford University said.</p>

<p>Dando was among a group of experts who on Monday launched an initiative by 

non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to establish a global monitoring network.</p>

<p>They admitted that their effort would be flawed since it did not have access to sensitive information, but said the publication of an annual report would put pressure other countries, notably in Europe, to implement verification.</p>

<p>"There is a problem in the US at the present time but that's no reason for 

the rest of the states to wash their hands of the issue," Ian Davis, of the British 

American Security Council (BASIC) said.</p>

<p>Washington insists that international efforts should concentrate on enforcing the existing BWC.</p>

<p>The US has accused six countries -- North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan and 

Syria -- of developing or producing germ warfare agents in violation of the treaty.</p>
