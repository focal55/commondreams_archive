<p>BRUSSELS   - The European Union has attacked United  States efforts to undermine a global war crimes court which  came into existence in April despite Washington's opposition.</span>

							</p><p>In a statement issued after a meeting in Luxembourg late on  Monday, EU foreign ministers severely criticized the draft  American Servicemembers' Protection Act, which seeks to  guarantee that U.S. soldiers could never face trial before the  International Criminal Court.</span>

							</p><p>The 15-nation bloc expressed concern that the bill, being  considered by Congress, would restrict U.S. participation in  U.N. peacekeeping operations, prohibit the transfer of evidence  to the court and bar U.S. military assistance to parties to the  tribunal.</span>

							</p><p>"These provisions could seriously undermine the work of the  ICC," they said.</span>

							</p><p>"The Council is particularly concerned about the current  provision authorizing the President to use all means necessary  and appropriate to bring about the release of any person who is  being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the  request of the ICC, including on the territory of EU member  states."</span>

							</p><p>The new court, which has yet to sit, will be based in The  Hague. Created by a U.N. treaty negotiated in Rome in 1998, it  is meant to try the most heinous war crimes, genocide and  crimes against humanity.</span>

							</p><p>The United States voted against the court's statute,  largely because it wanted exemptions for its own personnel and  demanded that the U.N. Security Council determine who should or  should not be prosecuted in the tribunal.</span>

							</p><p>Former President Bill Clinton signed the statute shortly  before leaving office in January 2001, but the Republican  administration of President Bush withdrew that signature and  has vowed to oppose the court.</span>

							</p><p>In its latest move, the Bush administration is trying to  get the U.N. Security Council to exclude all peacekeeping  operations from the tribunal's jurisdiction, diplomats in New  York said on Monday.</span>
