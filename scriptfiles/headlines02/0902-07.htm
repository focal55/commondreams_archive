<p>MOSCOW - Russia warned the United States on Monday that using force against 

Iraq would undermine stability in the region and complicate chances of settling 

the Iraqi issue, Russian news agencies said.

<p>Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, speaking at a news conference  alongside his Iraqi counterpart, said Russia had no evidence  that Iraq posed any threat to U.S. security. He said there was  no alternative to Iraq accepting the return of United Nations  inspectors to determine whether Baghdad held weapons of mass  destruction.<p>"Any decision to use force against Iraq would not only  complicate an Iraqi settlement, but also undermine the  situation in the Gulf and the Middle East," Ivanov was quoted  as saying after talks with Iraq's Naji Sabri.<p>Sabri was visiting Russia, a permanent member of the U.N.  Security Council, as part of Baghdad's concerted efforts to  fend off U.S. threats to attack it on grounds that it was  trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction.<p>Sabri visited China last week and Iraqi Vice-President Taha  Yassin Ramadan toured Syria and Lebanon.<p>Ivanov said he hoped the issue of authorizing a strike on  Iraq would never go before the Security Council.<p>"We hope that the question of use of force will not be put  to the Security Council and, therefore, the right of veto will  not be necessary," he was quoted as saying.<p>Ivanov said Russia could can not see "a single well-founded  argument that Iraq represents a threat to U.S. national  security" and disagreed with suggestions by senior officials in  Washington that there was no alternative to a military  solution.<p>"I will say frankly that I see no alternative to a return  of the international observers," he was quoted as saying. "Our  task is not to seek alternatives of any sort but to create  conditions for the return of the inspectors in order to open  the way for sanctions against Iraq to be lifted."<p>TIES FROM THE SOVIET ERA<p>Moscow has strongly backed Washington's "war on terrorism,"  launched after last September's hijacked airliner attacks on  the United States, but has rejected U.S. talk of an "axis of  evil" of states bent on obtaining weapons of mass destruction.<p>Russia enjoys good ties with Iraq dating from Soviet times  and has long called for the return of inspectors to deflate  pressure for U.S. military action and allow for the lifting of  U.N. sanctions first imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.<p>U.N. arms experts left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of a  U.S.-British bombing campaign to punish Baghdad for its alleged  failure to cooperate with inspectors.<p>Washington has used Iraq's alleged possession of chemical,  biological and possibly nuclear weapons to underpin President  Bush's campaign for a "regime change" -- a euphemism for  ousting Saddam.<p>Ivanov had urged Iraq at the start of the talks to pursue  talks with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to facilitate the  return of the inspectors and the eventual lifting of sanctions.<p>Ivanov also praised the "dynamic development" of relations  between Russia and Iraq. He made no mention in his opening  remarks of a cooperation program which Baghdad's ambassador  last month said was close to signature and worth $40 billion.<p>In Johannesburg, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz  told Reuters that the return of the inspectors was "still under  consideration." On Sunday, he said told CNN that the return of  the monitors under chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix was not an  option.<p>Wider rifts appeared in U.S. public opinion at the weekend  over any possible attack, with Secretary of State Colin Powell  suggesting the return of the inspectors was a critical step, in  contrast with Vice-President Dick Cheney. Several commentators  were quick to point out the contradictions.<p>Russian opposition to any attack on Iraq is seen linked in  part to efforts to recover billions of dollars in debts run up  by Iraq during the Soviet era. It also hopes its oil firms will  secure lucrative pumping contracts when sanctions are lifted.<p>Sabri was due in Cairo after Moscow to lead his country's  delegation at a meeting of Arab foreign ministers starting  there on Wednesday, an Iraqi Foreign Ministry source told  Reuters.</span>
