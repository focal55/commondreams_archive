<p>A boy was killed and seven people were injured in disputed Kashmir as Indian and Pakistani troops traded mortar fire, an official said.</p>

<p>The shelling further heightened the tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours that has been building since an Islamic rebel attack in Kashmir on Tuesday which killed 35 people.</p>

</font>Friday's fighting sent some 400 panic-stricken families scuttling from border villages, witnesses said.

<p>An Indian army spokesman said Pakistani troops opened "unprovoked" fire early in the morning on Indian posts in the Samba, R.S. Pura and Kathua sectors of Kashmir, 75 kilometres (47 miles) south of the winter capital Jammu.</p>

<p>The shelling killed a boy and injured four people in the southern border district of Arnia, while three people, two of them women, were injured in Kashmir's southern Poonch district, Colonel S.P.K. Singh, spokesman for the Indian army's Northern Command, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Small-arms fire -- from medium and light machine guns -- is common in this area on the border," said Singh.</p>

<p>"But this time Pakistan has been using mortars to target our posts," he said.</p>

<p>The Indian troops retaliated, Singh said.</p>

<p>The fighting affected the villages of Kathua, Hiranagar, Vijaypur, Samba, Arnia and Ranbir Singh Pura, a village chief, Omkar Saini, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We have prepared a plan to evacuate the people," Saini said.</p>

<p>"If more people migrate, we will set up relief camps in government schools and buildings and keep them there."</p>

<p>Rangeel Singh, a resident of Nanga village close to the border with Pakistan, said villagers were panic stricken.</p>

<p>"We want to immediately shift from this area because we suspect Pakistan will retaliate and we will be the target," he said.</p>

<p>Rohit Kansal, deputy commissioner of the Jammu region, said senior local officials had been despatched to the area to monitor the situation.</p>

<p>Colonel Singh said Pakistani fire had targeted the Sundari Nala and Gantar Mod areas of Poonch district, which is used by the Indian army to move men and supplies to forward areas.</p>

<p>"Pakistan is deliberately targeting the area to ensure vehicular movement is disrupted," he said.</p>

<p>According to the Indian army, Pakistani troops fire across the border to provide cover for Islamic rebels crossing into Indian Kashmir.</p>

<p>More than 35,000 people have been killed in the region since the beginning of a Muslim insurgency in 1989. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming and advising the rebels.</p>
