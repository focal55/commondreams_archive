<p>AMERICAN forces are preparing to hold a rehearsal for war with Iraq from a 

new military headquarters in Qatar. 

<P>Hundreds of officers from the US Central Command have arrived in the Gulf kingdom 

and will be joined by General Tommy Franks, their commander, this week. Within 

ten days they will begin a simulated “war game” in the region, the first of its 

kind outside the United States, Pentagon officials said yesterday. 

<P>The officials said that the commanders would return to their base in Tampa, 

Florida, after the exercise, called Internal Look, which is scheduled to last 

up to ten days. Nevertheless, the operation is a sign of the continued US military 

build-up in the Gulf as the possibility of war with Iraq looms. 

<P>President Saddam Hussein — and potential US allies in the region — will view 

the exercise as a demonstration of Washington’s resolve. In particular, it will 

send a message to Riyadh that the US is prepared to conduct a war without large-scale 

access to bases in Saudi Arabia. 

<P>It also highlights the growing American military presence in Qatar, where the 

new al-Sayliyah base has been transformed in recent months into a potential nerve 

center for American operations throughout the Middle East. The 262-acre base, 

which cost $100 million (£64.5 million), has more than 20 climate- controlled 

warehouses storing hundreds of tanks and other armored vehicles designed for desert 

combat. 

<P>About 300 American troops have been permanently based there since it opened 

in August 2000, but the exercise about to unfold, which will see an influx of 

750 US officers, could see the base become the centerpiece of the US military 

presence in the region. 

<P>General Franks, Commander-in-Chief of US Central Command (Centcom), will use 

the exercise to test whether the base’s command and control facilities are suitable 

for overseeing a war with Iraq. The 1991 Gulf War was run from Centcom’s Florida 

headquarters, as was the war in Afghanistan, although some decisions were taken 

from US bases in the Gulf. 

<P>The war game, which will be played out on computer screens and is distinct 

from the US military exercises under way in Kuwait, will see General Franks commanding 

his forces from Qatar alongside fellow US commanders in other Gulf countries. 

If it is a success, Internal Look will provide him with a template for a war with 

Iraq. 

<P>Al-Sayliyah is distinct from Qatar’s $1 billion al-Udeid airbase, which was 

built by Qatar to entice American military might. It would also play a crucial 

role in a war, especially if the Saudis refused to allow the US to run its air 

campaign from the Prince Sultan airbase near Riyadh. 

<P>Co-operation between the United States and Qatar is on a significantly higher 

level than US-Saudi relations, blighted by criticism from Washington that Riyadh 

is failing to do enough in the search for terrorist financiers. US officials say 

that they have not tabled a formal request with Qatar to command American forces 

from there. The Emir and his family have local sensibilities to consider, but, 

keen for US protection, they have long suggested that Centcom relocate to their 

country. 

<P>Iraqi officials said yesterday that four people had been killed and 27 injured 

by Western warplanes patrolling the southern no-fly zone in Iraq. US officials 

confirmed that American and British aircraft had attacked, but had hit an Iraqi 

air defense facility in response to Iraqi artillery fire. The Iraqis said that 

the aircraft had hit the administrative offices of the Southern Oil Company in 

Basra.</p>
