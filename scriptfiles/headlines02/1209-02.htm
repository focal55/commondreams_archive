<p>WASHINGTON&#8212;Jane Coe says she cannot sit home any longer and listen to 

the drums beating for war against Iraq. So, tomorrow, she'll take to the streets 

of the U.S. capital to join this country's growing anti-war movement.

<P></P>

"I'm not an activist really. I much prefer letter-writing to marching,'' the 64-year-old 

anthropologist said this weekend. "But I just couldn't sit at home any longer 

amid this drift, and all the buildup to a war in Iraq that we don't need."

<P></P>

Coe is helping to organize a peace march in downtown Washington on International 

Human Rights Day, a rally expected to bring together faith groups, seniors and 

peace activists.

<P></P>

"The public discourse is: `Bomb 'em. Gear up for war.' But in terms of Iraq, they 

didn't have anything to do with Al Qaeda, so linking them to terrorism is stretching 

it. And we need to give weapons inspections a chance to work. That's a chance, 

that's a hope,'' Coe said.

<P></P>

(The Bush administration blames Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network for 

the Sept. 11 attacks against America that killed about 3,000 people in New York, 

Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania last year.)

<P></P>

Saturday morning, Coe attended a meeting of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the 

Gray Panthers, a group dominated by seniors that has lobbied for decades on social 

justice issues. It's part of a growing coalition against war with Iraq.

<P></P>

In an auditorium foyer at the University of the District of Columbia, about 20 

people pulled their chairs in a circle for the meeting; the Gray Panthers moved 

their chairs closer together when one complained she could not hear.

<P></P>

"My motto is health care, not warfare,'' said Abe Bloom, 89, from his wheelchair, 

a magnifying glass hanging on a cord around his neck to help him read the handouts.

<P></P>

"It seems to me that Bush is determined, no matter what, to get a war out of this; 

but we're not about to send our children to die for oil,'' said Ethel Lubarsky, 

85, who sat next to Bloom and leaned on a cane.

<P></P>

As the Gray Panthers met, President George W. Bush used his weekly radio address 

to make clear he believes Iraq is hiding weapons of mass destruction, despite 

its submitting thousands of pages of documents disavowing such weapons to U.N. 

inspectors last week. "Inspectors do not have the duty, or the ability, to uncover 

terrible weapons hidden in a vast country,'' he told listeners.

<P></P>

Largely below the radar of mainstream media, the anti-war coalition is gaining 

momentum and members. They range from key labour unions, religious movements, 

campus groups and such groups as Black Voices for Peace to traditional Marxists.

<P></P>

John J. Sweeney, president of the 13-million strong AFL-CIO labour union has joined 

the movement, as has the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National 

Council of Churches, representing 36 Protestant and Orthodox denominations.

<P></P>

United for Peace, the Web site a San Francisco-based human rights group set up 

to track events commemorating Sept. 11, now has evolved into a clearing house 

for anti-war groups.

<P></P>

Pat Elder, who owns a real estate title company in Bethesda, Md., says he got 

involved with a Quaker group after attending an anti-war protest in October.

<P></P>

"A third of the people there were over 50 and I thought, `Jesus, man, that's not 

what I remember from Vietnam. I'm 47 and I was a teenager when the big Vietnam 

demos were going on." 

<P></P>

Now, he said, it merges "the person in the suburbs, the conservative crowd and 

the traditional activists ... to strike a tone that is more palatable to middle 

America. So we're not 20-year-olds in bandanas, shouting that Bush is a bastard."</p>
