<p>QUITO, ECUADOR&nbsp; - A United States citizen was deported Thursday from Ecuador 

after being detained Tuesday along with seven Ecuadorians as they engaged in a 

protest against the construction of an oil pipeline through the country's Amazon 

region. 

<p> The activist, Julia "Butterfly" Hill, best known for her two-year protest 

in which she lived in a giant redwood tree in the U.S. state of California, was 

taken without prior notice from the Provisional Detention Center, where she was 

held under arrest, to the Quito airport. Two hours later, the remaining detainees 

were released. 

<p> Hill said she had spent a long, tiring few days in Ecuadorian prison, but 

was not surprised to hear during the deportation hearing that the consortium Oleoducto 

de Crudos Pesados (OCP, heavy crude pipeline) Limited had sent a letter to the 

local police pressing for her deportation. 

<p> She also stated that the proceedings were illegal and that the rights of the 

people arrested had not been respected. But her greatest concern is the violation 

of "the rights of the communities devastated by oil exploitation," said Hill. 

<p> The oil pipeline targeted by the environmental activists is 540 km long and 

is to transport petroleum from the Ecuadorian Amazon region to the Pacific coast 

for refining and export. 

<p> The protesters were detained by the police as they staged a demonstration 

outside the offices of Occidental Petroleum, a member of the OCP Limited consortium, 

which is building the pipeline. 

<p> "The immigration police attacked us and beat us, and although some in our 

group were able to run, others were forced into the police cars," said Ricardo 

Buitr&#243;n, member of the environmental organization Acci&#243;n Ecol&#243;gica. 

<p> "I was never told what I'm being charged with. I was never once read my rights. 

I was shown a piece of paper in Spanish but was refused a translator," said U.S. 

activist Hill. 

<p> "The only reason I am being deported is because I have lent my solidarity 

to the forests of Ecuador and the communities defending their lands and their 

basic human rights," she added. 

<p> Hill, famous for her efforts to protect the world's forests, said by telephone 

from Panama, where she was waiting while arrangements were being made for her 

return to the United States, that her intention in Quito was to make it known 

that Occidental Petroleum is not complying with environmental standards in its 

construction of the pipeline. 

<p> On another front, several rural residents were arrested Thursday in the northeastern 

province of Sucumb&#237;os when the demanded compensation for the use of their 

lands for the pipeline route. 

<p> Since the beginning of the year, environmentalists from several countries 

have mobilized in protest against the Ecuadorian pipeline, citing its negative 

ecological and social impacts. 

<p> In March, special units of the police force arrested 17 members of Acci&#243;n 

Ecol&#243;gica and of the international environmental watchdog Greenpeace who 

had chained themselves to trees in the Mindo-Nambillo forest, a protected area 

50 km northwest of Quito, to obstruct work on the pipeline. 

<p> Then, in May, environmentalists and landowners from the same forest were detained 

for standing in the way of the OCP route. 

<p> The activists showed the press the ownership certificates of an 840-hectare 

tract of land through which the pipeline was to pass. They demanded the removal 

of the heavy construction machinery from the area. 

<p> But OCP Limited claimed to hold "right of way," granted by the government, 

to build on privately held property. 

<p> In June, environmentalists, lawmakers and journalists arrived from Italy and 

took over the offices in Quito of the Italian petroleum firm Agip Oil to protest 

its role in the pipeline-building consortium. 

<p> Ecuador's President Gustavo Noboa has accused Acci&#243;n Ecol&#243;gica of 

obstructing a project that, according the government, would provide important 

economic benefits to the country. 

<p> Noboa stated in May 2001 that he would fight the environmentalists "in the 

trenches" if they continued to take action against the pipeline project. 

<p> "In the past, we knew what they were called. We knew they were the extreme 

left. Today they are known as 'greens', ecologists," said the president. In his 

opinion, it is just "a handful of idiots" protesting the pipeline construction. 

<p> Greenpeace, meanwhile, has taken action in Germany to prevent WestDeutche 

Landesbank (WestLB) from freeing up a 900-million-dollar loan to finance the pipeline 

in Ecuador. 

<p> The government of the western German state of North Rhine Westphalia, holder 

of 43 percent of the WestLB shares, announced it would postpone financing until 

it verified the environmental impacts of the pipeline construction. 

<p> Representatives of OCP Limited, consisting of the Canadian transnational Alberta 

Energy, Italy's Agip Oil, Spain's Repsol-YPF, the U.S.-based Kerr McGee and Occidental 

Petroleum and Argentina's Techint, assured that the project complies with the 

environmental norms stipulated by the World Bank. 

<p> But the World Bank even contradicted that statement. In a communiqu&#233; 

issued in December, it reported that the OCP was not following its environmental 

rules.
