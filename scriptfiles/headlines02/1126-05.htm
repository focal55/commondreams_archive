<p>The global AIDS epidemic is expanding most rapidly in Eastern Europe and Central 

Asia and is fueling famine in southern Africa, according to the latest report 

from UNAIDS. The authors warn that the international response is desperately under-funded. 

</P>

<P>An estimated 42 million people worldwide are now living with HIV, up from 40 

million in 2001. Five million people were newly infected in 2002. And despite 

some success with AIDS awareness and prevention programs in South Africa and Ethiopia 

in particular, the African sub-continent continues to suffer most from the infection. 

More than three-quarters of the 3.1 million AIDS deaths in 2002 will be in this 

region. </P>

<P>"What we are seeing today in a number of countries of sub-Saharan Africa is 

an HIV epidemic that is overwhelming the resources of entire communities," says 

Peter Piot, executive director of <a href="http://www.unaids.org/" target="_new">UNAIDS</a>. 

</P>

<P>"We must act now, on a much larger scale than anything we have done before, 

not only to assist those nations already hard-hit but also to stop the explosive 

growth of AIDS in parts of the world where the epidemic is newly emerging," he 

says.</P>

<P>In 2002, there were 250,000 new infections in Eastern Europe and the Central 

Asian republics, bringing the total for the region to 1.2 million. In Uzbekistan, 

there were almost as many new infections in the first half of 2002 as in the entire 

previous decade. The sharing of needles by drug users is the main route of HIV 

transmission in these countries. </P>

<P> <B class="newscrosshead">"Critical moment"</B> </P>

<P>Across Asia, the spread of HIV is still in its early phase, the report says. 

Without effective action, an estimated 11 million more people will become HIV-positive 

in the region by 2007.</P>

<P>"This is a critical moment today in a number of countries in Eastern Europe, 

central, south and eastern Asia," says Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general 

of the World Health Organization. "Unless we see national initiatives championed 

by the highest level of government, the growth in infections can be unstoppable." 

</P>

<P>In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS is contributing to a steady fall in agricultural 

production, worsening the effects of devastating drought. </P>

<P>In 2001 alone, AIDS killed 500,000 people in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, 

Zambia and Zimbabwe. About 20 per cent of the adult population in these countries 

are living with HIV/AIDS and more than 14 million people are at risk of starvation. 

</P>

<P> <B class="newscrosshead">Fighting back</B></P>

<P>But the report also highlights the limited success of some anti-HIV programs 

In South Africa, the number of pregnant HIV-positive women under 20 fell to 15.4 

per cent in 2001, from 21 per cent in 1998. And in Ethiopia, the HIV rate is declining 

in young women in the capital, Addis Ababa.</P>

<P>"There is strong evidence from around the world that the AIDS epidemic does 

yield, in some cases dramatically, to determined human intervention," says Piot. 

"We can prevent 29 million new HIV infections this decade if we implement a full 

prevention package globally by 2005."</P>

<P>UNAIDS estimates that these programs in developing countries will require $10.5 

billion by 2005. To successfully combat AIDS, funding will have to rise to $15 

billion annually by 2007 and be maintained for at least a decade.</P>

<P>But earlier in 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 

announced it has allocated only about $1 billion over five years to fight HIV/AIDS.</P>
