<p>WASHINGTON  - Italian Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi met President Bush on Saturday and predicted  afterward that action might be taken against Iraq in early 2003  if Baghdad continued to bar U.N. arms inspectors.<p>It was the clearest indication yet from a world leader on  the timetable for any move against Baghdad, but Berlusconi said  he was sure Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would eventually bow  to United Nations' demands rather than face attack.<p>"However, if I should be proved wrong tomorrow and Iraq  does not comply with the U.N. ... then I think one can think in  terms of (action) in January or February," Berlusconi told a  news conference following his meeting with Bush at Camp David.</span>

<P>"You need time for any action. Nothing can be improvised in  this sort of field," he said.<p>Although he declined to discuss what precise steps might be  taken against Saddam, Berlusconi said it was clear the United  States was ready to use force.<p>The Bush administration is pushing the United Nations to  issue a tough new resolution in the coming weeks aimed at  forcing Baghdad to comply with previous pledges to open up its  weapons' program to outside inspectors.<p>"Saddam will have to accept the resolution that the United  Nations is drawing up. It will be in his best interests," said  Berlusconi, adding that the Iraqi leader was "a pragmatic  person" who would not want to risk losing power.<p>Bush has said he is "highly doubtful" that Saddam will end  11 years of defiance of the United Nations and has called on  the world body "to show some backbone" and stand up to Iraq.<p>BEST OF FRIENDS<p>Berlusconi is eager to portray himself as Bush's closest  continental European ally and was rewarded for his loyalty with  a coveted invitation to the rural Camp David retreat where he  had lunch with the president's family.<p>He was only the second Italian prime minister to go to Camp  David and he followed in the footsteps of another staunch U.S.  supporter, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who flew to the  Maryland retreat for talks with Bush last weekend.<p>If Washington decides to go to war with Iraq it will almost  certainly need to use numerous air and naval bases dotted  around Italy as staging posts during the build-up.<p>A senior political source said Berlusconi would want to  offer up Italian forces for the war effort, but said the prime  minister would face a tough time winning the backing of Italy's  traditionally anti-war public.<p>Making the case for action, Berlusconi told reporters he  believed Iraq posed a serious threat to world peace and urged  the United Nations to act with determination.<p>Ministers from the five permanent members of the U.N.  Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia  and China -- met on Friday for exploratory talks on a new  resolution aimed at getting weapons inspectors back into Iraq.<p>France wants a two-stage approach, with an initial  resolution demanding the return of the inspectors to be  followed by a second document spelling out the consequences  should Iraq continue to breath defiance.<p>Berlusconi, a billionaire media mogul turned politician,  said the French approach didn't make sense.<p>"What happens if Saddam says 'no' to the first resolution?  We have to hang on for a second resolution, leaving Saddam to  twiddle his thumbs waiting to be attacked?," he said.<p>Italy is not a member of the Security Council and  Berlusconi's comments are bound to annoy Paris. The United  States has yet to reply publicly to the French suggestion.</span>
