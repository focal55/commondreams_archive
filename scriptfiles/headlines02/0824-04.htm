<p>Iraq, strengthened by growing worldwide support against a US offensive, forged ahead with plans to resist the United States, announcing a diplomatic charm offensive.</p>

<p>Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan sounded the rallying call, mixed with a warning that Arab countries face dangers too if the United States seeks to overthrow the Bagdad regime.</p>

<p>"In a few days, emissaries of President Saddam Hussein will be sent to all Arab countries to update their leaders on the real situation," Ramadan said.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who openly embraced the United States to save them from Iraqi forces in 1991, came in for special mention by the vice president.</p>

<p>"We are confident that they understand the American threats against Iraq are against the whole Arab nation and confirm the intentions of the US-Zionist administration to attack the capacities of the nation, be it in Iraq, in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, in Syria or elsewhere," he told al-Ittihad weekly.</p>

<p>Ramadan said Iraq "hopes for more" from Saudi Arabia, noting that Riyadh's position "is moving towards the rejection of any attack against Iraq as several Saudi leaders have said on more than one occasion."</p>

<p>Baghdad's ties with Riyadh, broken since the 1991 Gulf War, are warming.</p>

<p>The first Saudi Arabian trade fair to be held in Iraq since Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990 is to open on September 9. A big Saudi trade delegation is expected and major Saudi firms will attend, the official al-Ittihad weekly said.</p>

<p>Rapprochement began at an Arab summit last March as it did with Kuwait, and has been bolstered by Saudi Arabia's steadfast refusal to countenance a US-led attack on Iraq from its soil.</p>

<p>Ramadan said Thursday that Baghdad would be ready to restore ties when Riyadh decided the time was right. Iraq was also looking to continue to mend fences with Kuwait, he added.</p>

<p>Foreign ministers of the six Gulf Arab states, who have individually all expressed opposition to a new war on Iraq, are to meet on September 2-3 to study the US threats.</p>

<p>The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has already expressed its opposition to an attack on Iraq, citing the negative repercussions on the entire region. Iraq has also been bolstered by the opposition of several European countries, notably Germany.</p>

<p>However, the vice president had harsh words for Israel, accusing it of pushing the United States to attack as a way out of the Palestinian uprising or intifada.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon urged Washington during a meeting with 

US officials in Tel Aviv not to delay in attacking the Iraqi regime, the daily 

Ha'aretz said last week.</p>

<p>Bush has come under fire, even by supporters of military action against Iraq, for failing to make his case to the US public and US allies.</p>

<p>Adding to Bush's predicament, Russia renewed demands Saturday that any US military strike be put to the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>Russia is sending a top delegation to Washington in September to argue against military strikes and has demanded firm proof from the United States that Baghdad was stocking up on weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>The Kremlin also played down recent reports of a 40-billion-dollar economic cooperation plan linking Baghdad with Moscow, that had spurred concern in Washington.</p>

<p>Turkey, a key US ally from where US warplanes fly to monitor and bomb Iraq 

almost daily, has also agreed to work for a long-term economic cooperation pact 

with Baghdad, and is strongly opposed to any military operation against Baghdad.</p>
