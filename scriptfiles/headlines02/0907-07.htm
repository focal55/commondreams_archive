<p>An internal inquiry by the Israeli army into the killing of 12 Palestinian 

civilians by its forces last week, including four fruit-pickers blown up by a 

tank shell packed with thousands of darts, has cleared the soldiers involved.</p>

<p>Investigations by the Israeli army into the killing or maiming of Arab civilians 

in the 23-month conflict have almost invariably resulted in whitewashes, but this 

did not diminish the condemnation with which yesterday's findings were greeted 

by Western sources, Israeli peace activists and Palestinian officials.</p>

<p>The inquiry said the "open-fire" orders that led the Israeli army to fire a 

120mm air- burst shell packed with 3,000 flechettes (inch-long darts), at a Palestinian 

family in their camp in a fig orchard in the Gaza Strip, were "appropriate". So, 

too, were the orders given to the snipers who picked off four laborers in a West 

Bank quarry on Sunday, allegedly because they saw them cutting a fence. And so 

was the command issued to an Israeli death squad in a helicopter that killed two 

teenagers and two children aged six and 10 in a botched assassination.</p>

<p>The inquiry found that in the first two of these cases, both on Palestinian-controlled 

land inside the occupied territories invaded by the Israeli army, soldiers had 

acted because they identified Palestinians who were behaving "suspiciously", including 

being in an "unauthorized area" late at night, crawling towards an illegal Israeli 

settlement and infiltrating Israeli agricultural land.</p>

<p>An Israeli army statement did not confirm or deny using a tank flechette round. 

But <i>The Independent</i> has examined an X-ray of one victim. Darts were embedded 

in his chest and stomach. The deaths of the children caused by the helicopter 

missile strike, in the West Bank village of Tubas, were dismissed by the Israeli 

army as "collateral damage" that was "probably caused by a technical malfunction".</p>

<p>The inquiry was ordered by the Defense Minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who 

complimented the Israeli army yesterday on its "thorough" work, a military statement 

said.</p>

<p>But Uri Avnery, an activist with the Israel pressure group Gush Shalom, said 

the three incidents were "manifestly illegal actions". He added: "If the army 

says its soldiers followed their standing orders, this shows their standing orders 

are manifestly wrong, and responsibility for all these actions rests on the army's 

high command."</p>

<p>One Western source declared himself to be "speechless" on hearing the outcome 

of the inquiry, which he described as a cover-up. "Why bother to set up an inquiry 

unless it is going to be thorough and impartial and unless the results will be 

followed up. None of this is true in this case."</p> </p>
