<p>COLUMBUS, Ga. -- More than 90 people, including at least 6 nuns, were arrested 

for marching onto Fort Benning grounds Sunday during an annual protest of a U.S. 

military program that trains Latin American soldiers. 

<P> "I feel anger at the deliberate teaching of violence," said

Caryl Hartjes, a nun from Fondulac, Wisc., as she entered the

compound. "I don't feel anger at the military who will put

handcuffs on me."

</table>About 6,500 protesters gathered for the 13th annual

demonstration by the School of the Americas Watch, which continues

to protest the Nov. 19, 1989 killings of six Jesuit priests in El

Salvador. Protesters said they demonstrate because some of the

people responsible for the killings were trained at the military

school.

<P> Demonstrators passed through gates, including one where they cut

the padlock and slipped through fenceposts to gain access onto the

property.

<P> Inside, a line of military police guided protesters up a hill

where they were arrested, a federal offense that carries up to six

months in prison.

<P> "This decision to go in is a spontaneous thing. There was no

planning," said Bill Quigley, a lawyer representing the

protesters. "We're here to support the voices that are trying to

make our country's international actions more just."

<P> Demonstrators carried American flags and crosses honoring the

alleged victims of the abuses in Latin America. Three protesters

carried a mock-coffin draped in black. Others wore shirts that said

"No War in Iraq."

<P> "I don't want to give up my freedom and I would enjoy peace and

justice more, but as a person of faith, I can't stand back and

watch the atrocities," said Dorothy Pagosa, a 48-year-old nun, as

she was being arrested. "The atrocities that have happened have

brought shame on this country."

<P> About 7,000 protesters took part last year, including 31 who

entered the post illegally.

<P> The Army's School of the Americas was replaced last year by a

new institution operated by the Department of Defense and

supervised by an independent 13-member board that includes

lawmakers, scholars, diplomats and religious leaders.

<P> Officials say the new school, known as the Western Hemisphere

Institute for Security Cooperation, still trains Latin American

soldiers, but also focuses on civilian and diplomatic affairs.

Human rights courses are mandatory.

<P> Protest leaders say the change was only cosmetic, and they have

promised to continue the demonstrations.
