<p>BUENOS AIRES — Pedro Troiani was at work on the assembly line at the Ford Motor 

plant here one morning in April 1976 when more than a dozen heavily armed men 

burst into the factory and made their way toward him, he recalled recently. </p>

<P> At gunpoint, he said, he was paraded through the plant and driven in a company 

truck to a soccer field in the factory complex where, he said, the Argentine Army 

had set up a barracks and detention center.</p>

<P> He described being bound with wire, kicked and held for eight hours on the 

factory grounds. Mr. Troiani, a labor leader at the time, said he and four other 

Ford employees were then transferred to a secret prison and eventually to a special 

detention camp as part of the "dirty war" against anyone considered a leftist 

opponent by the military dictatorship that ruled this country from 1976 to 1983. 

</p>

<P> A spokesman for Ford here, Rolo Ceretti, said he could neither confirm nor 

deny Mr. Troiani's account "because these events happened 26 years ago and most 

of the people who worked at the company no longer do." </p>

<P> But, he said, "to talk of a detention center within our plant is not correct." 

</p>

<P> "This was a very sad and bitter time," he added, "and no one can defend what 

happened. But to attempt to place responsibility on the company for things that 

happened at the level of government seems to me to be a bit absurd." </p>

<P> Based in part on Mr. Troiani's account, a federal prosecutor here filed a 

criminal complaint against Ford Argentina this month and ordered an investigation 

into the company's conduct under the junta that ruled this country. It charges 

that Ford and its senior executives "managed, participated in or covered up the 

illegal detention" of Mr. Troiani and nearly two dozen other employees. </p>

<P> In an interview, Mr. Troiani said: "Jail was pure terror because people were 

disappearing all the time and you didn't know if you were going to be the next 

to be killed. A lot of time has passed, but the truth is that Ford and its executives 

colluded in the kidnapping of its own workers, and I think they should be held 

responsible for that." </p>

<P> Over the next year, he says, he was repeatedly beaten, tortured and deprived 

of sleep and food. </p>

<P> The case is an outgrowth of similar charges made against Mercedes-Benz, today 

a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler. A total of 16 workers at its plant in a suburb 

of Buenos Aires were abducted either at home or on the job from 1976 to 1977. 

All but two are assumed to have been killed. </p>

<P> The Mercedes-Benz hearings have been going on for four years, propelled largely 

by the effort of a German journalist, Gabriele Weber, who has published her findings 

in a book in German, "The Disappeared of Mercedes-Benz." But the inquiry has received 

relatively little attention here because most Argentines are focused on the country's 

current economic collapse and are not eager to reopen an even more painful chapter 

of their history. </p>

<P> DaimlerChrysler Argentina did not respond to several phone calls requesting 

comment on the investigation. But Ursula Mertzig, a spokeswoman for the parent 

corporation in Germany, said the company was cooperating fully and was confident 

that no wrongdoing had occurred. "We have no hint that our management was involved 

in the disappearance of the 14 workers, which we regret very much," she said. 

</p>

<P> During the 1980's, an investigation by the National Commission on Disappeared 

Persons, a government body, found that abductions of workers occurred at Ford, 

Mercedes-Benz and other factories owned by both Argentine and foreign interests, 

including shipyards, steel mills and pharmaceutical plants.</p>

<P> By some accounts, about half of the estimated 15,000 to 30,000 people who 

disappeared during the dictatorship were workers or union leaders. </p>

<P> The prosecutor who filed the charges against Ford, Félix Crous, said both 

automakers not only colluded with the military, but also profited as the junta's 

campaign of kidnappings and killings made targets of workers and union leaders.</p>

<P> Each company, he said, had particularly close ties with the military as suppliers. 

Mercedes-Benz made trucks for the army, while Ford made the greenish-gray Falcons 

used by death squads in the kidnapping of thousands of people.</p>

<P> Ken Zino, executive director of international public affairs at Ford headquarters 

in Michigan, said: "Our situation is not analogous to Mercedes-Benz. We are aware 

of the allegations, but have yet to see anything and will respond at the appropriate 

time." </p>

<P> Both Ford and Mercedes-Benz were targets of the left-wing Montonero urban 

guerrilla movement during the chaotic period of political violence that preceded 

the March 1976 military takeover in Argentina. </p>

<P> A Mercedes-Benz executive was kidnapped and released only after the payment 

of a multimillion-dollar ransom. Ford withdrew its American employees from Argentina 

after at least two executives were ambushed and killed and others were injured 

between 1973 and 1975. </p>

<P> Mr. Ceretti, the Ford Argentina spokesman, said the threats "led Ford to ask 

for army protection for a time," but he added, "That is different from a detention 

center." </p>

<P> The day after Mr. Troiani was abducted, his wife says, she received a telegram 

from Ford warning that he was "absent without authorization" and would be fired 

unless he reported back to work immediately. </p>

<P> Mrs. Troiani replied with a telegram "saying that management knew perfectly 

well that I had been detained in the plant," Mr. Troiani said. But Mr. Troiani 

said he was treated simply as an absentee employee and was formally dismissed 

as soon as Argentine law permitted.</p>

<P> Mr. Ceretti, the Ford Argentina spokesman, said it was standard procedure 

at the time to dismiss absentee workers after they had been given proper warning. 

</p>

<P> After being held for nearly a year in three different prisons, Mr. Troiani 

said, he was then released to care for a sick child. Eventually, he opened an 

auto body shop, which he continues to operate today. </p>

<P> A court rejected his efforts to collect back pay from Ford for the time he 

was imprisoned, ruling that by the time he filed, after the fall of the dictatorship, 

the statute of limitations had expired. </p>
