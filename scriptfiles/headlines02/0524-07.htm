<p>Rock star Bono made a grab for America's purse strings as a four-nation aid and debt factfinding tour with US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill reached South Africa.

<P>

"He is the man in charge of America's wallet," Bono said of Mr O'Neill.

<P>

"And it's true, I want to open that wallet."

</table></font>The comment came as the dynamic do-good duo arrived in Pretoria for talks with South African President Thabo Mbeki.

<P>

"All three of us have a passion for seeing the world's living standard increase quickly for people who have been poor too long," Mr O'Neill said.

<P>

In a break from protocol, Bono, lead singer with U2, also met Trevor Manuel, South Africa's finance minister, in a meeting ostensibly called to sign a joint US/South African money laundering agreement.

<P>

Bono, who has long fought for the abolition of Third World debt, was welcomed by Mr Manuel as "an old friend".

<P>

<B>Cheers to boos</B>

<P>

The meetings followed a visit to Ghana, where Mr O'Neill and Bono toured villages, markets and a hospital.

<P>

"People should not be expected to live without clean water," Mr O'Neill said after his hospital visit.

<P>

"We should do something about it and do something about it now."

<P>

Mr O'Neill has been a vocal critic of anti-poverty programmes, saying they have wasted huge amounts of cash by failing to stimulate economic development.

<P>

But Bono warned that anger against the US could grow if it failed to act against poverty.

<P>

"We are driving down the streets and people are waving,

people are jumping up and down, they are glad to see the United

States," Bono said. 

<P>

"If this country doesn't get help, doesn't get the sense of a new beginning... you come back in five years and they'll be throwing rocks at the bus."

<P>

The US recently committed to boost aid by $10bn in 2004-06.
