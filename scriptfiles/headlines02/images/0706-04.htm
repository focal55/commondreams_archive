<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The US general leading the coalition campaign in Afghanistan said nearly 50 people may have been killed in a bombing raid on a wedding party, but that American investigators had been unable to determine how many people died.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Dan McNeill, commander of the coalition forces in Afghanistan, said that a more thorough investigation was needed into Sunday's bombing in central Uruzgan province as the US investigators were not shown any graves during a fact-finding mission.</p>
<p>"I believe there's 48 dead and 117 wounded," McNeill told a joint press conference 
with Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah while emphasizing that the figures 
were those of Afghan investigators.</p>
<p>"I believe that a more formal investigation will expose a lot more facts and 
expose a lot more of what occurred and why it occurred"</p>
<p>The joint Afghan-US fact-finding mission, which returned to Kabul on Saturday, was dispatched to Uruzgan province's Dehrawad district to probe the bombing which the US claims was prompted by hostile anti-aircraft guns in the area.</p>
<p>The United States has insisted that coalition aircraft attacked six targets near the village where pre-wedding celebrations were being held only after they were fired on.</p>
<p>McNeill maintained that American aircraft had come under direct fire but conceded that innocent civilians may have been killed.</p>
<p>"There is ample indication of direct fire against aircraft reported both from the ground and the air," the general said, confirming that a B-52 fighter and AC-130 gunship were involved in the incident.</p>
<p>"We have had in the process of this fact-finding some Afghan citizens saying there was fire from the ground although they offered they were celebratory types of fire.</p>
<p>"We do not attack our allies. Indeed, if innocent civilians died it had to be an accident. It is not our policy to target people."</p>
<p>Asked if the scale of the bombing was an overreaction to the fire from the 
ground, McNeill said that coalition forces always tried to respond with appropriate 
firepower.</p>
<p>"We always give due consideration to proportionality... That has been the consistent policy in this fight against terrorism."</p>
<p>McNeill's comments come after US President George W. Bush phoned his Afghan counterpart and close ally Hamid Karzai to express his condolences over the incident.</p>
<p>Bush "expressed his sympathies to the families there whose loved ones lost their lives," White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan told reporters Friday.</p>
<p>Abdullah said that the Afghan government would continue to back the US-led campaign against remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters but added that the "legitimate concerns of the people must be addressed" over the incident.</p>
<p>"Support for the coalition is there. The question is not whether to continue 
against al-Qaeda or whether to support the coalition, the question is to find 
ways and means to prevent tragedies such as these in the campaign," he told reporters.</p>
<p>McNeill said that the results of a more thorough investigation would take weeks but denied that there would be any attempt to sweep the matter under the carpet.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt it will take a few weeks. I simply do not have a timeline right now," he said.</p>
<p>"There has been injury and loss of life to innocent civilians ... we will want to know why."</p>
<p>Abdullah also said he expected it would take some time before a full picture emerged.</p>
<p>Grieving residents in the Dehrawad area have accused the United States of attacking their villages on the basis of flimsy intelligence.</p>
<p>"All of us in this village have been supporting Hamid Karzai in the process against the Taliban," said Abdul Qadir in the village of Kakarak.</p>
<p>"And we're given this treatment in return: dead bodies."</p>
