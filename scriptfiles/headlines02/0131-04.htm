The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) should focus a key session 

in March on 10 countries where labor activists are being targeted for harassment, 

repression, and, in some cases, even assassination, for trying to improve the 

lives and labor conditions of common workers, according to the world's largest 

union confederation. 

<p>In a report submitted this week to the European Union (EU), the Brussels-based 

International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) listed Colombia, where 

163 labor activists were killed last year, as the world's most dangerous country 

for union organizers. 

<p> The ICFTU, which includes 225 affiliated unions in 148 countries, said Burma--which 

last year was the target of unprecedented sanctions imposed by the International 

Labour Organization (ILO) for its use of forced labor--should also get special 

attention from the UN's top human rights body, which will meet from March 18 to 

April 28 in Geneva. 

<p> Others countries accused of targeting trade unionists include Belarus, Brazil, 

China, Colombia, Djibouti, Guatemala, Haiti, South Korea, and Swaziland, according 

to the report submitted to the EU's Human Rights Contact Group Tuesday. 

<p> The UNCHR, which consists of 53 countries, meets each year for six weeks during 

which it takes up submissions by governments and non-governmental organizations, 

like the ICFTU, about a variety of human rights concerns. 

<p> It may also consider issuing statements or resolutions to draw world attention 

to or condemn particularly troubling situations on which at least a majority of 

commission members agree. In some cases, it may even nominate a "special rapporteur" 

with a mandate to investigate the situation and report back to the commission. 

<p> The ICFTU has long tried to persuade the commission to adopt a special resolution 

on Colombia and nominate a special rapporteur to investigate the plight of labor 

organizers there. 

<p> Colombia--whose civil war has steadily escalated over the last five years--accounts 

for about 75 percent of all killings of union activists worldwide, according to 

the latest annual survey released by the ICFTU last October. 

<p> Most of the victims were assassinated by hired killers or right-wing paramilitary 

groups that are backed by wealthy businessmen, ranchers, and elements of Colombia's 

armed forces, according to independent human rights groups. In addition to the 

killings, hundreds of union organizers have received death threats, and many have 

been forced to flee their homes to save themselves and their families. 

<p> The Colombian government has successfully resisted the ICFTU's efforts at 

the commission in the past, but the umbrella union group said it was encouraged 

by talks last week with EU diplomats who reportedly expressed increasing frustration 

with Bogota's failure to stop the killings or, in many cases, to identify and 

prosecute the killers. 

<p> "No improvements could be expected from the Colombian authorities unless the 

pressure on them was stepped up considerably," the ICFTU said in its statement 

to the commission. 

<p> The ICFTU is also asking for a resolution in support of last year's ILO condemnation 

of Burmese forced labor, as well as a "clear message" to multinationals that are 

taking advantage of repressive policies in Myanmar to review their investments 

there. 

<p> Parts of Brazil, according to the ICFTU, suffer from similar problems as Colombia, 

with organizers of landless and indigenous workers being murdered and virtual 

impunity for gunmen hired by ranchers and wealthy landowners. 

<p> Latin America as a whole is considered the most perilous region by far for 

trade unionists, according to the ICFTU's general secretary, Bill Jordan. In the 

year 2000, it accounted for the some 90 percent of the world's total number of 

trade unionists who were killed or disappeared for their union work. 

<p> China is also a major concern, according to the ICFTU, both because of its 

refusal to guarantee the right of workers to organize independently of the state 

and because of the potential impact of its recent entry into the World Trade Organisation 

in increasing unemployment and aggravating social and economic tensions. 

<p> As a result, a new legal framework guaranteeing core labor rights in China 

is urgently needed, according to the confederation.
