            NEW DELHI   - India's army chief Gen. Sunderajan Padmnabhan on Friday 

dared Pakistan's president and military ruler, Gen Pervez 

Musharraf, to launch a nuclear first strike against his 

country, stepping up bilateral tensions even further. 

<p>

''If he (Musharraf) is man enough, let me correct that, if 

he is mad enough to override international opinion on that 

scale, then surely he must do it (launch a nuclear 

strike),'' Padmanabhan said at a press conference, a day 

before Musharraf was due to make a televised address 

outlining his policy toward 'jihadist' groups operating from 

Pakistan. 

<p>

Following a visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to 

the sub-continent earlier this week to help defuse tension 

as the nuclear-armed neighbors massed troops along their 

3,000 km border, pressure has been growing on Musharraf to 

clearly state his stand on terrorism. 

<p>

''We are looking forward to the speech he (Musharraf) will 

be giving later this week, which I think will be a powerful 

signal to his nation and to India and to the rest of the 

world,'' U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was quoted as 

telling journalists in Washington following a meeting with 

India's Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani on Thursday. 

<p>

Powell prompted Musharraf to include in the address, 

scheduled for Saturday evening, ''a condemnation of 

terrorism of any kind, because it is no longer acceptable in 

the 21st century for nations to live under this kind of 

threat''. 

<p>

For Musharraf, that would be a clear comedown from the 

position he took at last week's South Asian summit in 

Kathmandu, where he reiterated that ''freedom struggles'' 

had to be differentiated from terrorism. 

<p>

Musharraf's reference was to the territory of Kashmir, the 

possession of which is disputed by Pakistan and India when 

they were created by dividing what was British India until 

independence in 1947. 

<p>

Since then, the armies of the two countries have fought each 

other to a standstill along the Line of Control (LoC), which 

runs through Kashmir and across which artillery fire is 

regularly exchanged. 

<p>

India alleges that Pakistan has been arming and training 

'jihadist' groups to foment separatist violence in its 

portion of Kashmir, but Pakistan claims that these are 

indigenous groups fighting for freedom. 

<p>

After a suicide squad made an aborted attempt to blow up 

Indian Parliament on Dec.13, India's normally mild-mannered 

prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said his patience was 

at an end. 

<p>

He and his Cabinet ordered the halving of the strength of 

diplomatic Missions, the recall of India's high commissioner 

in Islamabad and banned flights by Pakistani aircraft over 

Indian airspace. 

<p>

But what set alarm bells ringing internationally was the 

reported redeployment of the bulk of India's more than a 

million-strong army, along with tanks and missile batteries, 

on the border with Pakistan, where US troops fighting the 

war against terror in Afghanistan are based. 

<p>

The 'New York Times' reported Friday that the US national 

security staff has intensified surveillance in the region 

for any evidence of the two countries deploying their 

nuclear arsenals. 

<p>

''We are significantly more worried today than were several 

days ago,'' the 'Times' quoted a senior member of President 

George W Bush's national security staff as saying. 

<p>

Padmanabhan admitted that a nuclear exchange between the two 

neighbors would be ''disastrous'', but was confident that 

India would survive a first strike by Pakistan to inflict 

unacceptable damage on its adversary. 

<p>

''Let me assure you of one thing as surely as I'm alive,'' 

he said. ''Should a nuclear weapon be used against India, 

Indian forces, our assets at sea, economic, human or other 

targets, the perpetrators of that outrage shall be punished 

so severely that their continuation thereafter in any form 

or fray will be doubtful.'' 

<p>

Echoing the stand of other Indian officials, Padmanabhan 

dismissed steps taken by Pakistan since the Dec 13 attack. 

He said the banning of two 'jihadist' groups that India 

named as responsible for the attack on its Parliament and 

the arrest of some of their leaders and cadres was 

''cosmetic'', and meant for the benefit of the US forces 

in Pakistan. 

<p>

''The terrorist cadres have been dispersed -- some to nearby 

villages, others to Pakistan Army units - so that they won't 

come to the notice of US forces,'' he added. 

<p>

In addition to its call for the closure of 'jihadist' camps 

operating from Pakistani territory, India has also demanded 

that Islamabad extradite 20 individuals, on charges ranging 

from hijacking to acts of terrorism. 

<p>

Musharraf, under growing pressure at home not to be seen as 

giving in too much to India, has refused to comply with his. 

He said that Pakistan could try, in its territory, whoever 

was involved in the Indian Parliament attack. 

<p>

India has matched its military posture with a diplomatic 

offensive led by Advani, who is currently campaigning for 

New Delhi's position in Washington as India tries to get the 

United States to bear down on Pakistan under the 

international campaign against terrorism. 

<p>

Powell, who is due to travel to South Asia next week to 

counsel peace, was quoted as saying he has indicated to 

Advani that the United States was hopeful.</p>
