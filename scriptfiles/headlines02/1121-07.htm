<p><a href="http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/" target="_new">The Rainforest 

Foundation</a>, which was set up by Sting and his wife, Trudi Styler, fell foul 

of other environmental groups yesterday by declaring that a scheme to promote 

ecologically sound timber was deceiving consumers.</p>

<p>The foundation claimed in a report that the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 

had failed to police the system for certifying that timber bearing its logo had 

been produced in a way that did not add to the destruction of rainforests or the 

exploitation of local people. The FSC was set up in 1993 to reassure consumers, 

and it has the support of groups including Friends of the Earth and the Worldwide 

Fund for Nature.</p>

<p>But the foundation claimed that timber companies certified by the FSC were 

implicated in human rights abuses, were logging in the rainforest habitats of 

endangered wildlife such as the Sumatran tiger and that "uncertified" wood had 

been labeled as environmentally friendly. The report also accused the FSC of marginalizing 

local communities in its decision-making process.</p>

<p>In its response, the council said it would investigate any abuses of human 

rights and asked the foundation for further details. It said the claim about the 

Sumatran tigers referred to concerns about a particular company in Indonesia which 

had already been dealt with by the local certification body.</p>

<p>But it added: "Concerns over tigers were not upheld as repeated audits have 

found evidence that wildlife, including tigers, are actually moving into the certified 

area as a result of improved forest management in the certified area."</p>

<p>The FSC said that when breaches of the certification system were found, action 

was taken immediately. "Whilst we welcome the Rainforest Foundation report for 

its extensive research we find that it cites many cases that have long been solved 

and in some cases major rule changes in FSC have resulted.''</p>

<p>Beatrix Richards, forests policy officer of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, 

said: "We have faith that this system is the best one available and that any faults 

can be dealt with. We can't do away with the council because what would you replace 

it with?"</p>

<p>A spokesman for Greenpeace, which is not a member of the FSC's council, said 

it still backed the body. "It's the only credible system that exists. The report 

does identify some failings and if that helps to strengthen the FSC, it can only 

be a good thing." </p>
