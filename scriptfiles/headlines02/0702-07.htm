<p>Mohammed Dahlan, the man widely regarded as the US and Israel's preferred successor 

to Yasser Arafat, today accuses President Bush of demanding a "coup d'&#233;tat" 

against the Palestinian leader and declares that he will not stand against Mr 

Arafat while he is under attack by Israel. 

<P>While conceding "reservations" about some of Mr Arafat's decisions, Mr Dahlan 

- who stood down as head of Palestinian security in Gaza last month - says Mr 

Bush's intervention had backfired and would keep Mr Arafat in place, rather than 

encouraging reform and a new generation of leaders.</P>

<P>Writing in the Guardian, Mr Dahlan says one result of Mr Bush's intervention 

is that the latest polls show nine out of 10 Palestinians would vote for Mr Arafat. 

"As long as the Israelis are against Arafat, I'm with him - whatever reservations 

I have about some of the decisions that have been made."</P>

<P>Mr Dahlan's conclusion supports the European view that Mr Bush made a misjudgment 

in his speech last week by targeting Mr Arafat. The speech opened a rift between 

the US and European countries, including Britain, which have said they will continue 

to work with Mr Arafat.</P>

<P>The strain in transatlantic relations has worsened over the past few days in 

a row over the international criminal court. Private criticism of the US by European 

governments has reached unprecedented levels because US hostility to the court 

threatens the peacekeeping missions in the Balkans.</P>

<P>The Arafat row has also widened the split within the American administration. 

The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, had shared the view of the Europeans 

but was overruled by Mr Bush, and, in a humiliating climbdown on Sunday, in effect 

severed ties with the Palestinian leader.</P>

<P>The Palestinian election will be held next January. Without the US ultimatum 

Mr Dahlan would almost certainly have been a contender.</P>

<P>Before Mr Bush's speech, Mr Dahlan and others had been quietly preparing for 

the succession. But such moves now appear to have been scuppered. Mr Dahlan said: 

"While the chairman is under siege, it would be wrong to criticize him - that 

would only serve Israel and America. There is no question of changing the leadership 

in these circumstances. If they try to expel or kill him - and anything is possible 

in the era of Bush and Sharon - they will come to regret it bitterly. Bush is 

now effectively demanding a coup d'&#233;tat against Arafat, because the American 

administration says even if he is re-elected in new elections, it will not deal 

with him."</P>

<P>Mr Dahlan - who remains a close adviser to Mr Arafat - yesterday ridiculed 

what he called the "lies and false allegations" that he was somehow favored by 

Israel, recalling an incident last year when his car was shot at by Israeli soldiers.</P>

<P>Mr Bush found himself isolated on the Arafat issue last week at the G8 summit 

in Canada . The Arab world is also uniting behind Mr Arafat.</P>

<P>The de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Abdullah, yesterday said his 

country "rejects any intervention by any side in Arab internal affairs, and on 

top of it the affairs of the Palestinian people, who alone have the right to choose 

their leadership".</P>
