<p>Bay Area organizations, backed by high-powered corporate attorneys, are taking 

the lead in a growing movement that uses U.S. courts to go after abusers of human 

rights worldwide. 

<P>Far from being just a rhetorical exercise, the potential impact of the movement 

became clear three weeks ago, when the <a href="http://www.cja.org/" target="_new">Center 

for Justice and Accountability</a>, based in San Francisco, won a $54.6 million 

judgment against two former Salvadoran generals living in Florida. 

<P>The ruling in favor of San Francisco high school teacher Carlos Mauricio and 

two other Salvadorans, who were tortured by security forces during El Salvador's 

civil war in the early 1980s, was the movement's biggest legal victory to date. 

<P>More than a dozen other cases are under way. The guiding doctrine is "universal 

jurisdiction" -- a legal concept stating that war crimes and other human rights 

cases can be tried in any nation's courts, no matter where the abuses took place 

or where the alleged offenders currently live. 

<P>"Universal jurisdiction is gaining force, and although it's far from clear 

how far the courts will take it, there are more and more cases all the time," 

says Naomi Roht-Arriaza, a professor of international law at Hastings College 

of the Law in San Francisco. 

<P>Roht-Arriaza points out that the two federal laws that support the concept 

are not new -- the Alien Tort Claims Act dates from 1789, and the Torture Victims 

Protection Act was enacted in 1991. 

<P>"There haven't been changes in the laws, but there's much more awareness by 

judges and litigants that these laws are out there," she says. 

<P>The Center for Justice and Accountability, a six-person nonprofit organization 

with only a $550,000 annual budget, is pursuing five other cases against individuals 

from China, Indonesia, Chile, Serbia and Honduras. 

<P>In one case, Gen. Johny Lumintang, the No. 2 official in the Indonesian army, 

is being sued by six victims of human rights abuses by troops under his command 

in East Timor. Lumintang initially chose to ignore the case -- a miscalculation, 

as he found out in September when a Washington, D.C., court awarded the plaintiffs 

$66 million. Now, the court is deciding whether to accept Lumintang's request 

to contest the charges. 

<P>Other cases brought by the center include: 

<P>-- China. Six Falun Gong practitioners are suing Liu Qi, mayor of Beijing and 

president of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2008 Olympics, for his alleged 

responsibility for police repression of the religious group. Liu was served with 

the complaint at San Francisco International Airport in February. 

<P>-- Chile. Armando Fernandez-Larios, a former Chilean army officer living in 

Miami, is being sued for his alleged involvement in the "Caravan of Death" - - 

a helicopter death squad that tortured and killed at least 72 political prisoners. 

<P>Meanwhile, another significant victory may be near in a case brought by three 

Bay Area activist groups -- <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/" target="_new">Global 

Exchange</a>, <a href="http://www.sweatshopwatch.org/">Sweatshop Watch</a> and 

<a href="http://www.asianlawcaucus.org/" target="_new">Asian Law Caucus</a> -- 

against 26 clothing corporations over abuses against Chinese workers in Saipan, 

a U.S. island in the western Pacific. Sources say all but one of the defendants, 

which include San Francisco firms Gap and Levi Strauss, are offering to pay the 

ex-workers $20 million and create a monitoring system to prevent labor abuses 

in their factories. A settlement is expected in the coming weeks. 

<P>But the universal-jurisdiction movement has had its setbacks, even in countries 

that have laws strongly supporting the concept. 

<P>Two years ago, Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon failed in his attempts to extradite 

former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to stand trial in Spain for human rights 

abuses. In April, a Belgian appeals court threw out a lawsuit against Israeli 

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon over his alleged role in massacres of Palestinian 

refugees in Lebanon in 1982. That case is being appealed to the Belgian Supreme 

Court, and the nation's parliament is debating a law that would allow the trial 

to go forward. 

<P>Although most of the U.S. cases originate with low-budget nonprofit groups 

such as the Center for Justice and Accountability, much of the actual prosecution 

is carried out by corporate law firms that donate their services pro bono. In 

a complex, long-running case, the value of these services can amount to millions 

of dollars. 

<P>The Salvadoran plaintiffs' case, for example, was led by a three-lawyer team 

from Morrison & Foerster, an international law firm based in San Francisco. The 

Caravan of Death plaintiffs are being represented by attorneys from Wilson, Sonsini, 

Goodrich & Rosati, a large corporate law firm based in Palo Alto. 

<P>On Monday, Morrison & Foerster is scheduled to receive the American Bar Association's 

annual award for pro bono work. Last year, the firm gave $21 million in free legal 

services to nonprofit groups or poor individuals. 

<P>According to <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/" target="_new">Amnesty International</a>, 

there are hundreds of foreign human rights abusers now residing in the United 

States -- many of them, like the Salvadoran generals, in luxurious retirement. 

<P>Their former victims, along with organizations like the Center for Justice 

and Accountability and their teams of blue-chip lawyers, have plenty of work left 

to do.</p>
