<p>Washington police are bracing themselves this morning for what could be the 

biggest weekend of protest in the US since the Seattle riots of 1999. With thousands 

of demonstrators expected, commuters have been urged to stay off the roads to 

prevent chaos. 

<P>The event is timed to coincide with the annual meetings of the World Bank and 

International Monetary Fund, but the demands on the placards will cover matters 

way beyond world capitalism - with the impending attack on Iraq probably top of 

the agenda. 

<P>As ever, the protesters will be ignored if they are peaceful, and condemned 

- but noticed - if they are not. But they will gather with a growing sense that 

the anti-war forces in the US have, not the wind behind them exactly, but at least 

the first puffs of a breeze. 

<P>Those implacably opposed to the war range from the far left to one congressman 

normally regarded as an extreme rightwinger. This week they at last acquired a 

semblance of leadership when the two most important Democrats, Al Gore - increasingly 

likely to be the presidential candidate again in 2004 - and the Senate majority 

leader, Tom Daschle, stopped trying to change the subject away from Iraq and hit 

back at the president. 

<P>In one of the most electrifying speeches the current Senate has heard, Mr Daschle, 

almost in tears, condemned as "outrageous" White House attempts to equate criticism 

with lack of patriotism. 

<P>He said he had never seen the words "Democrat" or "Republican" on a soldier's 

grave. 

<P>"We ought not politicize this war. We ought not politicize the rhetoric about 

war and life and death," he said. 

<P>The president failed to offer the apology Mr Daschle wanted, but changed his 

tone. "Democrats and Republicans," he said inclusively and pointedly, "refuse 

to live in fear." 

<P>The White House is negotiating with congressional leaders on the wording of 

the resolution they are expected to pass authorizing military action in Iraq. 

The negotiations are "civil", the president said, which may not be the whole truth. 

<P>Part of the subtext of the Daschle attack was that the administration is spinning 

the arguments out so the vote is held closer to the midterm elections on November 

5. 

<P>Both houses of Congress should pass authorizing resolutions by large majorities, 

with Mr Daschle and other Democrat leaders in reluctant acquiescence. But there 

will be a revolt, perhaps a substantial one. 

<P>This reflects a very different public mood from a year ago when only one lone 

Congresswoman, Barbara Lee of California, rejected the president's demand to act 

on Afghanistan. 

<P>There are also memories of the most infamous of these votes, in 1964, when 

just two senators voted against giving Lyndon Johnson authority to go to war in 

Vietnam. 

<P>The Senate figures may depend on the final judgment of a few influential doubters, 

like the respected Republican foreign affairs specialist Chuck Hagel. In the House 

of Representatives, where all the members face re-election, decision-making is 

complicated by imminent political concerns. 

<P>But David Bonior, a former Democratic whip, insisted that up to 100 of the 

House's 212 Democrats could vote against, along with "a handful" of Republicans. 

<P>Mr Bonior is visiting Baghdad with an anti-war colleague, Jim McDermott. They 

are politically fireproof: Mr Bonior is not running again, and Mr McDermott has 

a safe seat in liberal Seattle. 

<P>But they and other hardcore members of the awkward squad report a surprising 

amount of support for their stand even in less promising parts of the country. 

Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat congresswoman from Ohio, said she was buoyed up by the 

response of voters. 

<P>"I had a big party meeting in Toledo this week and, just listening to the people, 

you could tell the country isn't where the president is. They're stunned at the 

thought of war," she said. "I left Washington where the place is hunkered down 

for war. Back there they're concerned about the Oktoberfest, and the baseball 

and the football. 

<P>"I've had people coming up to me and questioning the president's balance and 

judgment. If there's an imminent threat, that's different, but they don't see 

it. " 

<P>Her views are echoed by a more improbable figure: Ron Paul, an off-message 

anti-government-interference Republican from Texas who rejects assisted health 

care as well as aggressive wars. 

<P>Mr Paul, who came third in the 1988 presidential election on the Libertarian 

ticket, brandished 200 papers which he said were the day's e-mail intake. "There's 

about 10 in there which say I'm a jerk," he said. "Most are very supportive." 

<P>He says that pre-emptive strikes are unconstitutional, since the president 

only has the right to respond to imminent threats, adding: "I disagree that there 

is a threat to the US from someone as small and ill-equipped as Saddam Hussein." 

<P>Ron Paul makes an unlikely bedfellow with the protesters due on the streets 

today, but this is a strange alliance. About 70 items of street art - decorated 

donkeys and elephants that have adorned Washington pavements this summer - have 

been moved for fear of vandalism. 

<P>They have found sanctuary in the grounds of a university. The idea that a student 

campus should be considered a safe haven from anti-war activists is just one more 

sign that this is not a re-run of the 1960s. 

<p><B>The lesson of Vietnam</B>

<p>The words "Gulf of Tonkin" have echoed round Washington again this week as 

old-timers remember how war panic can produce bad law. In August 1964, just two 

senators - Wayne Morse of Oregon and Ernest Gruening of Alaska - held out against 

a tidal wave of indignation. 

<P>President Lyndon Johnson got Congress to authorize"all necessary measures" 

after two North Vietnamese patrol boats reportedly launched unprovoked attacks 

on US ships. This became the legal basis for the subsequent war. 

<P>It is widely accepted now that the first ship attacked, the USS Maddox, was 

spying, and that the second attack did not happen. 

<P>Mr Gruening said: "This resolution is a further authorization for escalation 

unlimited. I am opposed to sacrificing a single American boy in this venture." 

<P>Mr Morse said: "I believe this resolution to be a historic mistake." 

<P>Nine years later, the War Powers Resolution was passed: now a president can 

take military action immediately, but he must go to Congress within 60 to 90 days 

for permission to continue the engagement.</p>
