<p>WASHINGTON, May 19 &#151; As President Bush heads to Miami on Monday to lay out tougher restrictions on travel to Cuba and lend support for government opponents there, a growing number of lawmakers from both parties are visiting the island on their own and demanding that the United States open it up to tourism and trade.

<P> Mr. Bush is personally and politically committed to a hard-line policy toward Cuba. In his speech on Monday, he will condition any easing of this policy on Cuba's adoption of democratic reforms, such as freeing all political prisoners and giving opposition parties the freedom to organize and speak. </p>

<P> In excerpts released by the White House on Sunday night, Mr. Bush laid out specific conditions that also included allowing outside observers to monitor the 2003 assembly elections and giving human rights organizations access to the country.</p>

<P> His appearance at a lavish fund-raiser of Cuban-Americans who support continued pressure against Havana will be a reminder of this group's pivotal role in the president's victory in 2000, and a vivid example of where domestic politics and foreign policy intersect.</p>

<P> But after decades in which the forces for isolating Cuba have dominated the policy, a new crop of lawmakers have demanded change. Advocates say that a majority in the House and Senate favor lifting the travel ban, but that the House Republican leadership has stymied any action. Farm groups, with substantial Republican support in Congress, are the most important growing organized constituency pressing to open lucrative overseas markets to American agriculture.</p>

<P> "For the first time, we have a debate on this when there may be a real balance of forces," said Lisandro Perez, a sociologist at Florida International University and a critic of the current American policy.</p>

<P> On Capitol Hill, Cuba is no longer a partisan issue with Republicans generally urging strict measures and Democrats advocating an end to them. Now, Midwestern Republicans have joined Northeastern Democrats to challenge the sanctions on trade and travel, and to call for a new approach in dealing with Havana.</p>

<P> "I'm with the president 95 percent of the time, but not on this one," said Representative Tom Osborne, a Nebraska Republican and former University of Nebraska football coach. "After 40 years, let's not just keep running up the middle. Let's throw a pass. Let's try something different."</p>

<P> But hard-liners say loosening the pressure now would be a mistake. Jaime Suchlicki, the director of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban American Studies at the University of Miami, said that a cash infusion would give new life to Fidel Castro's government and that farm-state lawmakers were undercutting the president by trying to strip him of his ability to punish rogue regimes.</p>

<P> Arguments that tourism and greater engagement would help open up Cuba, Mr. Suchlicki said, "are at best naïve and at worst hypocritical." He added: "They see Cuba as a bonanza, which it's not. Cuba is bankrupt."</p>

<P> Former President Jimmy Carter's call for easing sanctions against Cuba during a visit there last week elevated this running debate, and was groundbreaking on several other levels, said Jorge Dominguez, a Cuba expert and professor of government at Harvard.</p>

<P> "He compelled the Cuban government, and Fidel in particular, to recognize the opposition," Mr. Dominguez said. "He got to have his remarks in Spanish broadcast over Cuban national television. Only the pope has had that opportunity."</p>

<P> Cuba policy takes on added importance because of its political implications in Florida, where President Bush's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, is running for his second term and has relied on the strongly Republican Cuban-American vote. In recent years, Florida has emerged as a crucial swing state, magnifying the importance of Cuban-Americans, who represent only about 5 percent of the state's electorate.</p>

<P> Al Cardenas, the chairman of the Republican Party in Florida, said Cuban-American support for President Bush had increased to about 80 percent since he took office.</p>

<P> But Cuban-Americans are no longer united in their stance toward Cuba. Sergio Bendixen, a Miami pollster who tracks Hispanic issues, said that slightly more than half of Cuban-Americans in South Florida arrived since the early 1980's, and that they supported a more moderate policy. But their political influence is eclipsed by those who arrived in the 1960's and 70's, who generally take a much harder line and make up 70 percent of the Cuban-American electorate, Mr. Bendixen said.</p>

<P> "The challenge for the president will be not only to make hard-liners happy, but also hang onto a significant chunk who want more moderation," Mr. Bendixen said.</p>

<P> The tone and content of the Cuba policy debate are evolving. A decade ago, Cuban-American lawmakers, their allies and a well-financed lobby blocked discussion of engagement by questioning the anti-Communist credentials of the policy critics. Now, with the cold war a fading memory, the forces for engagement are demanding to know why the United States pursues trade or political dialogue with authoritarian states like China, but not Cuba.</p>

<P> A growing number of lawmakers are traveling to Cuba. This year, two Republican senators, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, dined with Mr. Castro and crossed paths with a bipartisan group of six House members.</p>

<P> "There's no question that Congress is moving toward a different policy with Cuba based on the reality that the current policy is outdated and irrelevant," said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.</p>

<P> Nonetheless, there is a growing sense among Democratic critics that some members of the Bush administration are using the possibility of a new national security threat to blunt calls for improved relations with Cuba. John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control, this month accused Cuba of developing biological weapons; both Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld distanced themselves from the charge.</p>

<P> Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who heads a Western Hemisphere subcommittee, announced hearings for this week to "review discrepancies" among administration officials on Cuba's ability to produce biological weapons.</p>

<P> Lawmakers on both sides of the debate said they faced an uphill struggle. There are enough votes in the House and Senate to lift the travel ban, advocates say. But the House leadership has twice blocked majorities seeking to open Cuba to travel. Even if supporters of change could muster enough votes, however, any easing of sanctions is likely to face a presidential veto.</p>

<P> "We're butting heads with the administration on this," said Representative John Thune of South Dakota, whom the White House has championed as the Republican candidate in the state's hotly contested Senate race this fall. "But we'll keep applying the pressure."</p>
