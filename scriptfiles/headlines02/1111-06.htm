<p>Bill Gates was last night facing the prospect of a humiliating snub from India's 

prime minister in a row over whether India will soon have the world's largest 

number of HIV/AIDS cases. 

<P>Mr Gates, the world's richest man, arrives in New Delhi today to announce a 

$100m charitable programme to fight the virus in India. 

<P>He had been expected to meet the country's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, 

but yesterday India's rightwing nationalist government made it clear that it was 

deeply unhappy with a study endorsed by Mr Gates that suggests 20-25 million Indians 

are likely to have the HIV virus by 2010. 

<P>The report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies 

, also predicted that India will overtake South Africa as the country with the 

largest number of AIDS cases. 

<P>In an interview over the weekend India's health minister, Shatrughan Sinha, 

said that Mr Gates was guilty of "spreading panic". The government took a dim 

view of "negative" comments by the Microsoft founder and by the US ambassador 

in New Delhi, Robert Blackwill, who last week warned that India was on the brink 

of a huge HIV/AIDS crisis, officials said. 

<P>Mr Vajpayee has now cancelled a meeting with Mr Gates scheduled for later today. 

<P>The unprecedented rebuff to the world's biggest philanthropist is all the more 

extraordinary given the fact that India's crumbling healthcare system clearly 

needs his money. 

<P>"I don't think anyone should contribute to spreading general panic," Mr Sinha, 

an actor-turned-politician, told the Indian Express newspaper. 

<P>"We are aware of the situation and it does concern me personally. But what 

do we achieve by saying in public that we will have 25 million people with AIDS 

in the coming years?" he asked. 

<P>"Every year we update the information on the HIV/AIDS scene in this country. 

And we are surprised by the figures being cited so freely." 

<P>Mr Sinha is also likely to be "unavailable" during Mr Gates' two-day trip to 

India, even though he recently agreed to take time out from his apparently hectic 

ministerial schedule to star in a Bollywood film. 

<P>India's ruling BJP party is notoriously sensitive to any criticism from abroad, 

and earlier this year fell out with both Britain and the European Union after 

they questioned its role during communal riots in the state of Gujarat. 

<P>Campaigners say the Indian government has deliberately underestimated the number 

of Indians with HIV/AIDS, and is in "deep denial" about the sheer scale of the 

problem. 

<P>Since the first case of HIV in India was discovered in 1986, the disease has 

spread from cities via truck drivers and prostitutes into the general population. 

Officially, New Delhi insists only 4 million people have the virus, but other 

estimates claim India already has 5-8 million cases. 

<P>Mr Gates last week paid tribute to India and said he wanted to put something 

back. "India is a super, super important country for the world, for the software 

industry and Microsoft in particular," he told the Times of India.</p>
