<p>The United Nations went into abrupt reverse yesterday and said it no longer 

intended to release a report compiled by a team of UN officials who visited the 

site where a US warplane attacked a wedding party in Afghanistan on 1 July. </p>

<p> The change of tack by the UN was apparently the result of pressure from within 

its own hierarchy, particularly in Afghanistan itself, and from the US not to 

release the report that allegedly contradicts claims made by the US about the 

circumstances of the attack. </p>

<p> The controversy first erupted on Monday when it emerged that a <a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines02/0729-01.htm">first 

draft of the report</a> written by the UN fact-finding team featured a number 

of potentially embarrassing allegations. They included the charge that the US 

had under-reported the numbers of people who had died and US soldiers had removed 

evidence from the site, suggesting a cover-up. </p>

<p> A UN spokesman said on Monday that a final draft would be made public within 

24 hours. That had all changed by yesterday morning, however. Instead, a statement 

from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said the report would 

remain an internal document and would be shown only to the Afghan and American 

governments. </p>

<p> The row came as Kabul released fresh details of a bombing attack that was 

foiled when a man driving a car loaded with explosives was arrested in the capital 

on Monday. Officials said the man was a foreigner, which often means Arab or Pakistani 

in local parlance. By all accounts, the plot, if successful, could have been devastatingly 

effective. The plotter had allegedly planned to detonate himself and the car in 

an attack either on the president, Hamid Karzai, his top officials or on foreign 

targets such as the US embassy or the headquarters of the International Security 

Assistance Force. </p>

<p> The Toyota was packed with large quantities of TNT and C4 explosives that 

could have caused widespread damage. </p>

<p> It would have been detonated by wires connected to two extra car batteries. 

"He mentioned Karzai as one of his natural targets," Amruallah Salhi, an Afghan 

security official, said of the suspect. "What we have gathered indicates he was 

a suicide bomber." </p>

<p> Though it was thwarted, the plot highlights the vulnerability of the new Afghan 

leadership. </p>

<p> In the statement, the UN Assistance Mission said: "The United Nations was 

not involved in either an inquiry or an investigation but simply responding to 

humanitarian needs as it does everywhere in the world." Sources confirmed the 

UN report had put the death toll at 80, compared to 48 deaths cited by the Afghan 

government. The Pentagon said it found only five graves there. </p>

<p> * The White House has set up an office devoted to improving the United States' 

image. The Office on Global Communications was unveiled yesterday just as a New 

York-based institute, the Council on Foreign Relations, urged Mr Bush to fix "America's 

shaky image abroad" before negative sentiment undercuts US interests.</p>
