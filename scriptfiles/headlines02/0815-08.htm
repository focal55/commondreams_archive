<p>DALLAS - The U.S. Justice Department official in charge of cracking down on 

corporate corruption was sued on Wednesday for alleged securities fraud.

<p>Legal watchdog group Judicial Watch said it filed a suit in  federal court in San Francisco charging Deputy Attorney General  Larry Thompson of conducting misleading accounting practices  and insider trading when he was on the board of Providian  Financial Corp .<p>Other directors of the San Francisco-based credit card  issuer were also named in the complaint.<p>"The Providian scandal points to the current Washington  culture where politicians, business leaders, accounting firms  and lawyers are all in bed with each other," Larry Klayman,  Judicial Watch's chairman, told a press conference.<p>The suit said that Thompson was a board member and chairman  of Providian's audit and compliance committee from 1997 until  he was named to his new job in the Bush administration in May  2001.<p>The complaint alleges that Thompson and other directors  knew that Providian's financial condition was deteriorating,  and they adopted a fraudulent scheme to delay recognition of  losses from the second quarter of 2001 into the third quarter  of 2001.<p>The alleged scheme allowed Providian's stock prices to  become artificially inflated. Before the financial problems  became public, and the company's shares fell, the suit alleges  that Thompson and other sold off the stock they had acquired by  exercising stock options.<p>Klayman claims Thompson sold up to $5 million of stock.<p>An official with Thompson's office was not immediately  available for comment.<p>Officials at Providian also were not immediately available  for comment.<p>Klayman said the suit was filed on behalf of Robert Lake, a  Texas resident and a shareholder of Providian, who is seeking  unspecified compensatory damages and over $75,000 in punitive  and exemplary damages.<p>Washington-based Judicial Watch is an eight-year-old legal  foundation that has filed a number of highly publicized  lawsuits against government officials.<p>Described by Klayman as "fiercely nonpartisan but  conservative," the group's targets have included former  President Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Janet Reno, the  White House, the State Department, the Pentagon, the FBI and  the CIA.<p>Not all the suits have been successful, but they have  earned Klayman a reputation for bringing sensitive documents to  public view and for aggressive promotion in the media.<p>The group recently sued Vice President Dick Cheney and  Halliburton Co.,the oil services company he once ran, alleging  they defrauded shareholders by overstating company revenues.

<p>Providian shares were off 1.28 percent, or 6 cents, to $4.63 in early afternoon 

trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
