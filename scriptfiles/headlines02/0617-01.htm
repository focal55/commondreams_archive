<p>WASHINGTON - John Lewis remembers seeing them just on the periphery of the 

action.</P>

<P>He and others would be rallying, meeting, or marching, pressing for civil rights 

deep in the American South of the 1960s, and the FBI agents would often be there, 

too.</P>

<P>They'd be nonparticipants, of course. But they'd be there just the same.</P>

<P>Lewis, director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, wanted the 

agents to take a more active role, ''stopping the discrimination and the beatings,'' 

he said.</P>

<P>A few years later, Lewis learned why the G-men simply scribbled down names 

and notes while he and others were bitten by dogs and beaten by local police.</P>

<P>''They were spying on the movement,'' said Lewis, now a US representative from 

Georgia.</P>

<P>The spying extended to individuals as well. Tom Hayden, a former California 

state legislator who was a leader of the civil rights and antiwar movements during 

the 1960s, found memos calling for him to be ''neutralized.''</P>

<P>The FBI's counterintelligence programs on civil rights advocates, black radicals, 

and pacifists - code-named Cointelpro - generated a backlash after they came to 

light in the early 1970s. That backlash led to restrictions on how agents could 

conduct surveillance, how long they could conduct it, and who could be the subject 

of such surveillance.</P>

<P>Sept. 11, however, has provided federal officials with the motivation for a 

return to domestic surveillance. New guidelines spelled out by the Justice Department 

on May 30 make it clear that agents will be allowed to conduct ''online research'' 

even if their efforts are not linked to an established criminal investigation. 

Preliminary inquiries, which allow agents to gather evidence before a crime is 

committed, can take as long as a year, well beyond the old 90-day limit. Special 

agents in charge at the field office level can authorize terrorism investigations 

that used to require the approval of the director or assistant director of the 

bureau.</P>

<P>The new rules also allow agents to enter public places and events, such as 

religious gatherings and political events, to investigate possible terrorist activities.</P>

<P>Justice Department officials have emphasized that the excesses of the past 

won't be repeated.</P>

<P>But Lewis and others who found their names in once-secret FBI files aren't 

so sure. </P>

<P>''If they start down this road, it won't be halfway,'' Lewis said. ''It won't 

be a little bit. This is a very dangerous thing to do in a society such as ours.''</P>

<P>Supporters of the new policies argue that the safety of that society depends 

on an FBI that can monitor some residents to make sure all are protected. Even 

before the new rules were announced, former FBI agent Michael Miles was calling 

for more internal scrutiny.</P>

<P>''We're going to have to have an MI-5-type organization that just does domestic 

intelligence,'' said Miles, who was a counterterrorism consultant for Saudi Arabia. 

''We can't win this war without domestic intelligence.'' MI-5 is the British security 

intelligence system. It is similar to the CIA, but has more power to spy in domestic 

matters.</P>

<P>The British and people in some other European nations are more comfortable 

with domestic surveillance than Americans are, a fact that terrorists are well 

aware of, he said. Germany is an example of how opportunistic terrorists are, 

Miles said.</P>

<P>''There's a reason Al Qaeda based themselves in Germany,'' Miles said. ''With 

the history of the Gestapo, they know Germany's not going to spy on them. So they've 

used Germany as a sort of base. It's frustrating.''</P>

<P>However, many Americans, particularly those who have been the subject of domestic 

surveillance, find the prospect of a newly aggressive FBI alarming.</P>

<P>Lewis recalls former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's determined view, evident 

years later in the reams of documents Lewis got through the Freedom of Information 

Act, that the antiwar and civil rights movements had been infiltrated by communists 

who were using them to destabilize the United States.</P>

<P>And now, in Attorney General John D. Ashcroft's statements and in the new insistence 

that terrorists have burrowed deep into American society, Lewis sees frightening 

parallels. ''It is eerie,'' he said. ''It reminds me of another period in our 

history.''</P>

<P>After hearing how the bureau spied on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis 

requested documents on the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He got one 

batch on the organization and another on him.</P>

<P>The documents tracked Lewis's movements, noted people he spoke to and what 

he did. He was outraged, he said, but not shocked. ''We had lived with the possibility 

that this was going on,'' Lewis said. ''I was more surprised that they spent all 

of this time doing this. I felt then and still do feel that it was a waste of 

manpower.''</P>

<P>Hayden shares that view.</P>

<P>He obtained more than 20,000 pages of information through the Freedom of Information 

Act documenting domestic surveillance by both the CIA and the FBI.</P>

<P>''Included were memos from Hoover ordering that I be `neutralized' and inviting 

FBI suggestions,'' Hayden said.</P>

<P>Louis Schneider, executive secretary of the pacifist American Friends Service 

Committee from 1974 to 1980, said he remembers the day he got copies of the secret 

files the FBI had compiled on his organization.</P>

<P>The large stacks of boxes came with a 50-page summary that concluded that AFSC 

is not a ''subversive organization. It is a sincere pacifist organization.''</P>

<P>''I was amazed to see letters I had written to agencies in other countries'' 

inside the boxes, Schneider said. One letter, addressed to an agency head in Moscow, 

was opened and resealed.</P>

<P>Hayden said he does not oppose monitoring groups that could do serious harm, 

''but my experience indicates that our intelligence agencies always have a political 

and ideological agenda that interferes with their ability to understand the sources 

of hatred and alienation,'' he said.</P>

<P>That fundamental lack of understanding is part of the reason why the FBI has 

gone too far in the past, said Brian Glick, a lawyer who has represented civil 

rights era clients and written a book about the bureau's actions during Cointelpro.</P>

<P>Glick said he believes the bureau never completely stopped conducting Cointelpro-like 

operations; they just did fewer on a smaller scale. But now, with old restrictions 

removed, all bets are off, he said.</P>

<P>''My sense is the restrictions have operated somewhat like speed limits,'' 

he said. ''If the speed limit is 55 miles per hour, we'll drive 65, 70, or even 

80.''</P>
