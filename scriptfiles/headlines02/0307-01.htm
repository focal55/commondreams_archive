Israel has rejected a rare rebuke from the United States, by using tanks and warplanes to launch new attacks on Palestinian targets.

<p>The Israeli offensive continued despite Washington  Israel's staunchest ally  directing some of its toughest criticism yet at the Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon.

<p>"If you declare war on the Palestinians and think you can solve the problem by seeing how many Palestinians can be killed  I don't know that [that] leads us anywhere," the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, told a congressional hearing on Wednesday.

<p>"Prime Minister Sharon has to take a hard look at his policies to see whether they work," he said.

</font>But there was no let-up in the Israeli offensive, with dozens of tanks rolling into the Palestinian-ruled city of Tulkarm and air raids launched in the West Bank, just hours after an attack on the West Bank headquarters of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.

<p>

Mr Arafat, who has been confined to Ramallah by Israeli forces for three months, was meeting the European Union Middle East envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos when a missile slammed into an adjacent building. No-one was hurt.

<p>Elite Israeli commando units took control of parts of Tulkarm and two nearby refugee camps, confining people to their homes, as they carried out house-to- house searches for terrorist suspects. At least two Palestinians were reported killed in one of the camps, while a third was shot dead by Israeli troops in a village south of the West Bank city of Jenin.

<p>Mr Sharon rejected Mr Powell's criticism, saying that the military operations were carried out in self-defence.

<p>"The Palestinian Authority and its leader [Mr Arafat] declared war on Israel, and those who have initiated the war also have the power to stop it," he said.

<p>Mr Sharon received the backing of his Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, often a strong critic of the military strategy and who supports an immediate return to negotiations. Mr Peres said he objected to Mr Powell's remarks. Israel was "not fighting the Palestinian people", he said, only those bent on killing Israelis.

<p>On Monday Mr Sharon said that before peace talks with the Palestinians could resume, "they must first be hit hard ... so that they understand terrorism will achieve nothing".

<p>"Only after they are beaten will we be able to hold talks, and I want a peace deal," he said.

<p>Mr Powell had also spoken to Mr Sharon earlier in the week, saying Israel and the Palestinians were following policies that would lead to more violence.

<p>"It's a tragic situation," he said. "I am not satisfied that both sides have thought through the consequences of the policies they are following."

<p>The United Nations warned that the situation was spiralling out of control. The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, called on Mr Arafat and Mr Sharon to halt the fighting and begin talking.

<p>"History will judge them harshly. And their people will not absolve them if they fail to do so."

<p>The carnage and the hostile rhetoric between the two sides appalled him, he said.

<p>"The situation has clearly got completely out of hand, and the risks are great."
