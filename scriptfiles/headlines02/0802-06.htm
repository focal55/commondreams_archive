<b>Land</b>

<p>Scientists estimate that over the past 150 years humans have altered nearly 

47 per cent of the Earth's land surface. The World Atlas of Biodiversity, published 

by the United Nations yesterday, suggests that the complex but delicate interaction 

between terrestrial plants and animals will be threatened on almost three quarters 

of the total land surface within the next 30 years.</p>

<p>The terrestrial environment extends over little more than one quarter of the 

Earth's surface, or nearly 150 million square kilometers (58 million square miles). 

It is the most accessible to humans and has therefore suffered the most in terms 

of environmental degradation and loss of species.</p>

<p>Dry land is characterized by its extensive collection of complex plants harboring 

a rich and diverse array of animals. Forests and woodlands are the natural cover 

for much of the world's land. Photosynthesis &#150; the process used by plants 

to convert sunlight into chemical energy &#150; is most intense in tropical forests, 

which are among the richest places in the world in terms of biodiversity.</p>

<p>The Atlas says that half of the area of forest that had developed since the 

last ice age has since been cleared or degraded by man. The decline is especially 

prevalent today in the tropical rainforests of South-East Asia, the Congo and 

parts of the Amazon. About 22 per cent of these areas are used for farming, towns 

and other kinds of human development. By 2032, scientists estimate this exploitation 

may more than double to 48 per cent of the total land area that they now cover.</p>

<p>Areas of the land that are not covered by trees &#150; such as shrubland, deserts 

and tundra &#150; tend to be poorer in terms of biodiversity, with the exception 

of Mediterranean-type shrub, which can be among the richest places on Earth for 

plants and animals. Humans have degraded many of the natural shrubland regions 

by burning and overgrazing, activities that have also led to the loss of valuable 

plant species.</p>

<p>The extinction of land plants is contributing to the loss of important genes 

for crops as well as new sources of medicines and pharmaceutical products. The 

Atlas suggests that we are losing one important new drug every two years because 

of the extinction of plants and animals and yet less than 1 per cent of the world's 

estimated 250,000 tropical plants has been screened for potential pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, 

said this loss of new sources of drugs could be arrested if local people were 

encouraged to take part in their preservation. "We must address the issue of genetic 

resource sharing by giving developing countries, where the majority of biodiversity 

remains, an economic incentive to protect wildlife by paying them properly for 

the plants and animals whose genes get used in new drugs or crops," Mr Toepfer 

said.</p>

<p><b>Oceans</b></p>

<p>Human activities, directly or indirectly, are now the primary cause of changes 

to the makeup of the animals and plants in the oceans.</p>

<p>About one third of the human population lives within the coastal zone &#150; 

within 60km (37.3 miles) of the sea &#150; and this proportion is forecast to 

rise this century. "Pressures exerted by the human population on the marine biosphere 

are substantial and increasing," the Atlas says.</p>

<p>In many ways the Earth is a water world, with oceans covering 71 per cent of 

the surface. Furthermore, the average depth of the oceans is about four times 

the average elevation of the land, making it even bigger in terms of total volume.</p>

<p>Despite its size, however, the marine environment produces about the same amount 

of organic matter as the land because photosynthesis &#150; the process on which 

all life ultimately depends for energy &#150; is limited to the upper layers of 

the ocean.</p>

<p>Some parts of the oceans are highly productive whereas others are virtually 

barren. The diversity of marine species is not as great as the diversity of terrestrial 

species, perhaps because the marine environment is more uniform and continuous.</p>

<p>The seas are the richest source of wild protein in the human diet. It comes 

in the form of fish, mollusks (e.g. mussels) and crustaceans (e.g. shrimps), but 

over the past decade this supply has begun to dwindle. Over the past 50 years 

the world catch has grown fivefold but since the 1990s it has declined substantially 

despite increased efforts to find fresh stocks of fish. More than half of the 

world's main fisheries are suffering from overfishing.</p>

<p>The Atlas identifies 18 marine "hotspots" in the world that are rich in endemic 

species. Many of these are coral reefs &#150; often described as the tropical 

rainforests of the sea &#150; which harbor some of the most diverse wildlife communities 

on Earth.</p>

<p>Although marine algae, microscopic plants, provide most of the energy needed 

to support life in the sea, other plants also play a role. Among the most important 

of these are the sea grasses. As with the coral reefs, some of the most important 

sea grass beds are being lost. Since the 1930s, sea grass beds along the Atlantic 

coasts of America and Europe have been lost to a marine slime mould possibly linked 

with toxic pollution and trawling.</p>

<p>In addition to fish, the oceans also support other important groups of animals, 

such as sea mammals and sea birds, which have all suffered through hunting and 

modern fishing methods.</p>

<p><b>Lakes and rivers</b></p>

<p>Inland waters constitute a tiny fraction of the Earth's total surface area 

yet they are vital for human settlements and have consequently borne the brunt 

of the worst excesses of man's activity, often by becoming a dumping ground for 

human waste. Only 2.5 per cent of the world's water is freshwater and a large 

proportion of this, some 69 per cent, is locked up in the form of ice and permanent 

snow. Much of the rest is in subterranean aquifers, which means that only 0.3 

per cent of the world's freshwater resides in lakes and rivers.</p>

<p>While the amount of available freshwater is limited, demands on it continue 

to grow as the human population expands. Agriculture consumes about 70 per cent 

of all water drawn from the world's lakes, rivers and aquifers, but much of this 

soaks away or evaporates before it reaches the intended crop.</p>

<p>Freshwater, and the lakes and rivers that provide it, being a vital resource 

for human survival, come under conflicting demands with increasingly adverse consequences 

for their biodiversity, according to the World Atlas on Biodiversity. "There are 

indications that, overall, a higher proportion of inland water species are in 

decline than marine or terrestrial forms," it says.</p>

<p>Animals are particularly diverse in inland waters. Freshwater fish, for instance, 

are more diverse than their marine cousins, probably because of the isolated nature 

of rivers and lakes. Scientists estimate there is one fish species for every 15 

cubic kilometers of freshwater compared with one fish species for every 100,000 

cubic kilometers of seawater.</p>

<p>About 40 per cent of known fish species occur in freshwater, with about 10,000 

species confined solely to lakes and rivers. Inland waters support a large number 

of wildlife species, wading birds, freshwater reptiles and mammals, despite accounting 

for such a small proportion of the Earth's surface area.</p>

<p>Freshwater, which links the land with the sea, typifies the complex interactions 

that characterize the study of biodiversity. Affecting the land can have an impact 

on lakes and rivers, which in turn can change the oceans.</p>

<p>Mark Collins, the director of the United Nations Environment Programme World 

Conservation Monitoring Center in Cambridge, emphasized at yesterday's launch 

of the Atlas that life on Earth cannot be considered in isolation. He cited the 

case of land degradation on the slopes of Mount Kenya, which is not just affecting 

the species on the mountain. People downstream from the river formed by Mount 

Kenya now have to contend with flash floods and droughts caused by a sporadic 

flow of water resulting from deforestation.</p>

<p>"Biodiversity is not just about species. It's about how they interact with 

one another," Dr Collins said. "The conservation of the resources of the natural 

world is not a luxury any more but essential to the quality of human life." </p></p>
