<p>Dozens of multinationals including Barclays Bank, De Beers and Anglo American 

have been accused of facilitating the plunder of the Democratic Republic of Congo's 

wealth in a scathing UN report published yesterday. 

<P>An independent panel of experts reported to the UN security council that 85 

multinational companies based in Europe, the US and South Africa had violated 

ethical guidelines in dealing with criminal networks which have pillaged natural 

resources from the war-torn central African country. 

<P>According to the panel, a scramble for gold, diamonds, cobalt and copper by 

army officers, government officials and entrepreneurs from Congo and neighboring 

African countries had generated billions of dollars which found its way to mining 

companies and financial institutions. 

<P>The panel did not detail the accusations against the 85 multinationals but 

said it had evidence that they violated OECD ethical guidelines, to which Britain 

was a signatory. The British government will be expected to take action because 

12 of the companies are registered in Britain. 

<P>"Home governments have the obligation to ensure that enterprises in their jurisdiction 

do not abuse principles of conduct that they have adopted as a matter of law," 

said the 59-page report. 

<P>The panel's report accuses a Zimbabwean businessman of procuring military equipment 

from BAE Systems (part of the former British Aerospace) in violation of European 

sanctions. The report named John Bredenkamp as a key investor in the Aviation 

Consultancy Service Company, which represents BAE Systems. The report alleges 

that he offered to mediate sales of British Aerospace military equipment to Congo. 

The panel said he procured aircraft parts for Zimbabwe, which was propping up 

the Kinshasa government. 

<P>"Mr Bredenkamp's representatives claimed that his companies observed European 

Union sanctions on Zimbabwe but British Aerospace spare parts for Hawk jets were 

supplied early in 2002 in breach of those sanctions," the report said. 

<P>The publication of the report caught several of the multinationals by surprise 

and they scrambled to obtain copies. 

<P>A Barclays spokesman said: "We have not yet seen a copy of the report . . . 

but I can assure you that we take our ethical responsibilities extremely seriously 

and apply high standards of business conduct across our operations worldwide." 

<P>De Beers declined to comment until it had seen the report and Anglo American 

did not return calls. The other British-registered companies were Afrimex, Mineral 

Afrika, Euromet, Das Air, A Knight International, A&amp;M Minerals and Metals, 

Alex Stewart, Arctic Investment and Amalgamated Metal Corporation. 

<P>Fran&#231;ois Grignon, the central Africa director for the research organization 

International Crisis Group, welcomed the report's targeting of multinationals. 

"Even providing a bank account to those who are exploiting the resources is a 

substantive role," he said. "The corporations must accept responsibility. They 

benefit more from this dirty business than those doing the digging and mining." 

<P>The report named an additional 29 companies and 54 individuals, mostly African 

and Belgian, which it said were directly involved in the plunder and should be 

considered for financial restrictions. 

<P>The five-member panel had Egyptian, Canadian, American, Belgian and Senegalese 

members, and British and Swiss technical advisers. It was mandated by the security 

council to investigate the scramble for Congo's resources in the wake of four 

years of war which left 2 million dead. 

<P>Some of the report's harshest criticism was leveled at officials from several 

African countries who stayed in Congo after peace deals led to the official withdrawal 

of outside forces. The list of the accused is a roll call of top military officers, 

government officials and businessmen, including the Rwandan army's chief of staff, 

James Kabarebe, Zimbabwe's parliament speaker, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and Uganda's 

army chief of staff, Major General James Kazini. 

<P>"The elite networks derive financial benefit through a variety of criminal 

activities, including theft, embezzlement, diversion of public funds, undervaluation 

of goods, smuggling, false invoicing, non-payment of taxes, kickbacks to public 

officials and bribery," the report said. 

<P>So lucrative and elaborate was the looting that there were attempts to prolong 

the fighting by stirring conflict between rival militias and rebels. "Those &#91;criminal&#93; 

groups will not disband voluntarily. They have built up a self-financing war economy 

centered on mineral exploitation," the panel said. 

<P>Rwanda's claim to have stayed in Congo to hunt the Hutu interahamwe militia 

responsible for the 1994 genocide was described as a cover for its army's desire 

to strip minerals. The report even claimed that Rwanda had collaborated with its 

enemies. It cited a letter from Jean-Pierre Ondekane, a senior pro-Rwandan official, 

urging all army units to maintain good relations "with our interahamwe and Mayi-Mayi 

brothers", and "if necessary to let them exploit the sub-soil for their survival".
