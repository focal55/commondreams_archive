            <p>MEXICO CITY - More than 2,000 peasant farmers from throughout Mexico 

              staged a protest Tuesday in the capital to demand a freeze on the 

              agricultural provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement 

              (NAFTA), which they blame for most of their economic and social 

              woes.

                  U.S. into Mexico as they fear the market will be flooded with

</table></font>But their demands do not appear to have much chance of winning 

              the desired response from the government. 

            <p> ''I have nothing. I am here out of desperation because I am poorer 

              than I have ever been,'' said Francisco Martínez, an elderly farmer 

              who took part in Tuesday's march in Mexico City, carrying a sign 

              that read ''NAFTA Equals Death''. 

            <p> Under the slogan ''the countryside can endure no more'', farmers 

              from 24 of Mexico's 32 states marched in Mexico City to the Congress 

              building to present their demands and later staged protests outside 

              the U.S. and French embassies. 

            <p> UNORCA, the national union of some 30 regional peasant groups, 

              organized the demonstrations with the aim of preventing the agricultural 

              trade liberalization measures -- agreed under NAFTA, which comprises 

              Canada, Mexico and the United States -- from taking effect in January. 

            <p> The new phase of liberalization entails the complete elimination 

              of tariffs on 21 farm products, including potatoes, wheat, apples, 

              onions, coffee, chicken and veal. 

            <p> The NAFTA mechanism, which UNORCA describes as ''toxic to the 

              Mexican countryside,'' establishes three steps towards liberalizing 

              the farm and livestock sector. The first occurred in 1994 when the 

              three-nation treaty entered into force, the second is slated for 

              January, and the third in 2008. 

            <p> In 1993, when NAFTA was still being negotiated, the government 

              of Carlos Salinas, then president of Mexico (1988-1994), agreed 

              to the process of a gradual elimination of agricultural tariffs 

              with the support of the country's leading farm organizations. 

            <p> Now, nearly a decade later, they are all complaining. 

            <p> Recognizing the difficulties that Mexican farmers face with the 

              deepening of trade liberalization, President Vicente Fox announced 

              in November that the government would provide support for rural 

              producers to the tune of 10 billion dollars in 2003, or 7.7 percent 

              more aid than this year. 

            <p> Fox stated last month that he is very concerned about how the 

              trade liberalization process is unfolding, ''in light of the U.S. 

              subsidies to its agricultural production.'' 

            <p> He said he would take up the matter with the George W. Bush administration, 

              but there has not been any indication of action so far. 

            <p> The Mexican president's aim would be to press the United States 

              to eliminate its farm subsidies, which total 19 billion dollars 

              a year, nearly double what Mexico has budgeted for its farmers in 

              2003. 

            <p> But Washington announced that it will not alter its farm subsidy 

              policies and that the situation of the Mexican farmers does not 

              justify annulment of the agricultural chapter of NAFTA. 

            <p> Mexico would not ask for a suspension of the trade agreement's 

              farm provisions anyway, say Fox administration sources, because 

              doing so would mean revoking the country's recognition of the treaty 

              itself. 

            <p> Since NAFTA took effect, Mexico's overall exports shot up from 

              60.9 billion dollars in 1994 to 158.4 billion dollars in 2001. In 

              that same period, imports jumped from 79.3 billion dollars to 168.4 

              billion dollars annually. 

            <p> More than 85 percent of Mexican trade is currently concentrated 

              in exchange with the United States. 

            <p> But for Mexico's rural areas, where 75 percent of the population 

              living in extreme poverty is concentrated, the three- country treaty 

              has meant the loss of more than 10 million hectares of cultivated 

              land. 

            <p> And the decline of the rural sector has pushed 15 million peasants 

              -- and mostly young people -- to move to the cities, either in Mexico 

              or in the United States, according to a study by the Autonomous 

              National University of Mexico (UNAM). 

            <p> Over the last 10 years, the participation of the farming sector 

              in Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen from 7.3 percent 

              to less than 5.0 percent. 

            <p> The protests Tuesday echoed similar demonstrations in November, 

              including the blockade of a main federal highway by farmers in the 

              state of Morelos, neighboring the Mexico City federal district, 

              and protests by peasants from the southern states of Oaxaca and 

              Guerrero outside government offices in the capital. 

            <p> The common denominator of all of these events is the rural producers' 

              rejection of NAFTA. 

            <p> ''The farmers are walking towards death because they are up against 

              the 'disloyal' trade competition from the United States and the 

              Mexican government's desertion of the countryside,'' says Alberto 

              Gómez, UNORCA executive coordinator. 

            <p> Without exception, Mexico's farmer organizations believe the new 

              phase of NAFTA-stipulated farm trade liberalization will generate 

              more poverty and prompt more people to leave rural areas. 

            <p> They also reckon that the financial support Fox has promised will 

              not be nearly enough. 

            <p> Mariano Ruiz, an analyst with the Mexico City-based Grupo de Economistas 

              y Asociados, says the worst blow for the Mexican farmers will come 

              in 2008 when the agricultural tariffs on products like maize and 

              beans are lifted. 

            <p> An estimated 2.8 million Mexican farm families make their livelihood 

              from these commodities. 

            <p> ''The countryside is a time-bomb that could explode very soon,'' 

              commented Rosario Robles, chairwoman of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary 

              Party (PRD), the country's third political force. 

            <p> The elderly farmer Martínez, who joined his colleagues for the 

              Mexico City march Tuesday, does not believe in anything that the 

              Fox government is offering. 

            <p> ''I have heard many things in the two years since he took office. 

              The one thing for certain is that I am getting poorer and poorer,'' 

              he said.
