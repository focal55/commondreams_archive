<p>BAGHDAD - Qatar has joined other Arab countries in opposing a possible U.S. 

military attack against Iraq to oust the government of President Saddam Hussein.

<p>Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr  al-Thani said his visit to Baghdad, which ended on Tuesday, was  aimed at averting a "catastrophe," in clear reference to  looming U.S. threats of military action to oust Saddam.<p>"We are of course against any military action," he told  reporters on Monday.<p>U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney on Monday cited mortal  danger to the United States from Iraqi weapons of mass  destruction falling into the hands of terrorists, and said:  "The risk of inaction is far greater than the risk of action."<p>Al-Thani said Washington had not asked Qatar to provide  military facilities to U.S. troops to attack Iraq.<p>"America has not yet asked us to provide new military  facilities or informed us that it is intended to launch a  military action (against Iraq)," he said.

<p>Qatar hosts a U.S. military base, which Washington is upgrading, prompting 

speculation it could be used as a launch pad for attacks on Iraq.
