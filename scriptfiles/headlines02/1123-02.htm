<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 — The <a href="http://www.aclu.org" target="_new">American 

Civil Liberties Union</a> has agreed in principle to hire Representative Bob Barr, 

a Georgia Republican and one of the most conservative members of Congress, as 

a consultant to work on privacy, surveillance and national security issues.</p>

<P> Mr. Barr was defeated in the Republican primary in August after redistricting forced him into a contest with another Republican congressman.</p>

<P> Anthony D. Romero, the A.C.L.U.'s executive director, said in an interview today that his group was completing a six-month contract with Mr. Barr that will start on Jan. 1.</p>

<P> "We are delighted to have Congressman Barr join us in advocating for individual privacy," Mr. Romero said. "It indicates that the A.C.L.U. has no permanent friends and no permanent allies, just permanent values."</p>

<P> Mr. Barr, a former prosecutor, gained national notice for his aggressive pursuit of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. </p>

<P> Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he has made a point of challenging Bush administration's policies that he believes could violate civil liberties. </p>

<P> Today's announcement follows a similar arrangement the A.C.L.U. has with Representative Dick Armey, the departing House majority leader who is also a conservative Republican. Mr. Armey has also been critical of some Bush administration initiatives, including a program that would have enlisted workers, delivery people and others to report suspicious activities by people in their homes and workplaces.</p>
