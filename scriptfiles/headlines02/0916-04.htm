<p>Two ships carrying radioactive material back to Sellafield were expected to 

face a massive protest today when they entered the Irish Sea.</P>

<P>A fleet of up to 20 boats, led by Greenpeace’s <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>, were 

on standby this morning in the south of the Irish Sea to highlight what they described 

as the "dangers of nuclear material".</P>

<P>The five-tonne cargo of plutonium mixed oxide fuel (mox) was sent back from 

Takahama in Japan after safety records at Sellafield, which is operated by British 

Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), were exposed as false in 1999.</P>

<P>The two nuclear freighters, the <EM>Pacific Pintail </EM>and <EM>Pacific Teal</EM>, 

carrying the&nbsp;the fuel were located yesterday by Greenpeace in the North Atlantic, 

200 miles off the French coast.</P>

<P>The ships, which were heading north towards the Irish Sea, have sailed around 

17,500 miles since they left Japan in July and are expected to reach port at Barrow, 

near Sellafield, Cumbria, tomorrow morning.</P>

<P>Part of the flotilla of protesting boats left the port of Holyhead yesterday 

morning to station itself in the south of the Irish Sea, while others departed 

for Barrow.</P>

<P>Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace said the Nuclear Free Irish Sea Flotilla now numbered 

more than 20 yachts and had been growing daily, with other yachts on standby.</P>

<P>"It has been deployed to different areas of the Irish Sea to ensure the ships 

receive the maximum impact of the protest," he said. </P>

<P>"These two international pariah ships will enter the Irish Sea to be confronted 

with flotilla boats, which together represent the views of countries around the 

world which are saying this trade in nuclear bomb material has to stop before 

a disaster happens."</P>

<P>The activists, including Irish rock star Jim Corr, put to sea on Thursday to 

search for the radioactive shipment on its way back to Sellafield.</P>

<P>The group’s flagship, the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>, led a handful of boats from 

Dublin port while more vessels set sail further south from Arklow in County Wicklow.</P>

<P>In addition to the protest, the Irish government has decided to deploy Navy 

vessels and spotter aircraft in its territory in the region to monitor the shipment 

when it nears its shores.</p> </P>
