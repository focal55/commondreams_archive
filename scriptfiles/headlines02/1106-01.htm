<p>BERLIN - Europeans, having at times accused George W. Bush of cowboy diplomacy, 

worried on Wednesday the U.S. president would be more emboldened, especially on 

Iraq, following his Republican party's mid-term election gains.

<p>The man from Texas and his center-right party gained the  historically rare opportunity to control the presidency and  both houses of Congress with a strong showing in Tuesday's  elections.<p>"The likelihood that the American president will feel even  more self-confident about his own views than prior to the  election is great," Karsten Voigt, German Chancellor Gerhard  Schroeder's U.S. affairs coordinator, told Reuters.<p>"But on the other side, I think that he needs to convince  Europeans. And so far as military action (in Iraq) is  concerned, he has not convinced the Germans -- yet."<p>Much of Europe has voiced concern about U.S. calls for  regime change in Iraq and criticized Bush on such issues as  global warming, the U.N. war crimes court and his branding of  Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil."<p>The Bush administration has had to prepare three drafts  since early last month of a resolution on disarming Iraq in  hopes of getting it through the U.N. Security Council.<p>Schroeder has been the strongest voice in Europe against a  possible U.S.-led war against Saddam Hussein, resulting in a  worsening of German-American ties.<p>Will the Republican victory lead to a more unilateralist  foreign policy and irritation abroad?<p>"Any support for Bush and the Republicans will be in the  interests of Bush's vision so that he can do what he wants,"  said Emad Gad, political analyst at Egypt's al-Ahram Center for  Political and Strategic Studies.<p>"He considers this as authorization from the people for his  policies, especially on Iraq."<p>One top U.S. diplomat in Europe said Bush would be  encouraged by the election result but insisted the president  would not become reckless.<p>"More self-confident, yes. More authority? He'll probably  interpret it that way," he said. "But does that mean that he is  going to grab the steering wheel and veer off course? No, I  don't believe that."<p>FEARS OF MORE TENSION<p>European Union diplomats expressed concern privately that  the Republican sweep could take the Bush administration further  down the path of unilateralism which has caused serious tension  with Europe since Bush took office in January 2001.<p>"This is not going to make transatlantic relations easier  because we have many issues on the table which could be  complicated to handle with a Republican president and  Congress," one diplomat said, citing Iraq and the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular.<p>The sources said EU policymakers had hoped the Democrats  would at least hold on to their control of the Senate and rein  in the more hawkish, go-it-alone elements of the Bush  administration.<p>"Their economic policy worries us to a lesser extent than  political issues, because in trade you have the independent  World Trade Organization which is a mechanism to solve  disputes. We don't have that mechanism on political issues,"  another diplomat said.<p>In Russia, analyst Sergei Morgunov of the Politika  foundation said: "There will not be a cardinal change, but the  current positions will be strengthened, especially as the  defense budget is likely to receive a boost."<p>Andrei Ryabov, an analyst with the Moscow-based Carnegie  Endowment for International Peace, said the Republican gains  would strain U.S. ties with Europe rather than with Russia.<p>"There is no reason for change, especially as the Russian  and the U.S. positions on terrorism are converging, while this  is not true for U.S.-European relations," he said. "The U.N.  resolution on Iraq will depend less on Russia and China than it  will on France."<p>Some officials were more optimistic about Bush's approach.

<p>"I am still hopeful that President Bush will follow through on his Iraq course 

of the last few weeks concentrating on the United Nations," Friedbert Pflueger, 

a conservative expert on foreign affairs in the German parliament, told Reuters.
