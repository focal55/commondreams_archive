<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 27 — The Bush administration has approved construction 

of a geothermal power plant in the Modoc National Forest, a remote volcanic field 

near California's border with Oregon that local tribes consider sacred.</p>

<P> Indians and environmental groups accused the government of betrayal today 

and said they would fight the decision.</p>

<P> The project, at Telephone Flat, was blocked two years ago by the Clinton administration 

because of concerns about intrusion on the lands. The plant would be two miles 

from Medicine Lake, which the tribes believe has healing powers.</p>

<P> In reversing the Clinton administration decision, officials said "the overall 

interests of the public would be best served" by allowing the project to proceed. 

Specifically, the decision, released on Tuesday, cited the need for developing 

renewable energy sources.</p>

<P> Calpine, the utility in San Jose that wants to build the 48-megawatt plant, 

owns extensive leases for geothermal development in the national forest. Calpine 

sued the government for $100 million when the project was rejected, but agreed 

to drop the claim if the Bush administration reconsidered the plan.</p>

<P> Gene Preston, chairman of the Pit River Tribe, one of four near Medicine Lake, 

said his 2,000 members felt cheated by the reversal.</p>

<P> Two years ago, when the plant was rejected, another geothermal complex proposed 

by Calpine was approved at nearby Fourmile Hill, just outside the most sacred 

area. Mr. Preston said the tribe agreed to drop public protests over the Fourmile 

Hill plant in exchange for a five-year moratorium on additional power projects.</p>

<P> "We sat down and worked out a compromise," Mr. Preston said. "We thought we 

had five years so that studies could be done and level minds could make more informed 

opinions. Now that is all moot."</p>

<P> Mark Rey, under secretary for natural resources and environment in the Agriculture 

Department, which oversees the forest service, said Mr. Preston's complaint was 

with the Clinton administration.</p>

<P> "I don't know the specifics of this promise because I was not there," Mr. 

Rey said. "But I can tell you the lion's share of my first year in office has 

been spent trying to figure out what the outgoing administration promised and 

whether or not it would be wise public policy to redeem those promises. We are 

trying to do what is right here."</p>

<P> He said the Calpine suit had heavily influenced the Telephone Flat decision.</p>

<P> "The Justice Department said we are going to lose boatloads of taxpayer money 

if we don't find a way to give these guys a fairer hearing," Mr. Rey said. "If 

some folks don't like the decision, the company has already made commitments to 

make the decision more palatable."</p>

<P> A spokesman for Calpine said it was studying the decision, which included 

new conditions, including moving the 13-mile power line to run parallel to a Forest 

Service road and not pass near Medicine Lake.</p>

<P> "There are a number of things that have to be reviewed," the spokesman, David 

J. Michetti, said.</p>

<P> In approving the plant, the administration rejected the recommendation of 

the Advisory Council on Historical Preservation, a federal agency that seeks to 

preserve important cultural and historical places.</p>

<P> About 24 square miles of volcanic fields near Medicine Lake, known as the 

Medicine Lake Highlands, were declared a traditional cultural district in 1999 

and are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. In a letter to 

Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, the advisory council urged denying the plant 

a permit. "The costs to the historic resources of Native Americans and our nation 

are too high," the letter said.</p>

<P> The Pit River tribe and others consider Medicine Lake and the surrounding 

area a spiritual sanctuary. They believe that the creator descended from nearby 

Mount Shasta and bathed in the lake, giving it healing powers. Medicine men still 

train there, and coming-of-age ceremonies are conducted there. Many Indians immerse 

themselves in the lake to cleanse the body and soul.</p>

<P> Mr. Preston said the tribes believed that the geothermal energy, which would 

be tapped for electricity, had a spiritual origin and should not be tampered with. 

Already, he said, tribe members wait until nightfall to conduct ceremonies at 

the lake to avoid motor homes and boaters. A plant at Telephone Flat would further 

tip the balance toward the outsiders, Mr. Preston said.</p>

<P> "We have to hide in the bushes and wait until everybody is gone and sneak 

out on the lake," he said. "Our land was taken away initially with land claims, 

and now they are trying to take our culture and religion."</p>

<P> Deborah Sivas, director of the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford 

University, who has represented the Pit River tribe in a suit over Fourmile Hill, 

said the reversal on Telephone Flat was a big setback. Calpine might view the 

ruling as a green light to move forward with more geothermal projects, Ms. Sivas 

said.</p>

<P> "We really perceive this as a policy coming down from Washington to push energy 

development at whatever cost," she added.</p>

<P> Mr. Preston said he worried about the future of his ancestral lands, as well 

as the precedent. He said he recently met for three hours with Kathleen Clarke, 

director of the Bureau of Land Management, and Dale N. Bosworth, chief of the 

Forest Service.</p>

<P> "They gave me a clear and open opportunity to make our case," Mr. Preston 

said. "But at the end, they described it as a clash of cultures. They understood 

our plight and were sympathetic to it. They said they recognize our culture, but 

also the culture of capitalism."</p>
