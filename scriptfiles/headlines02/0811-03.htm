<p>Days after returning from his third trip to Iraq, Phil Steger told more than 

200 antiwar demonstrators at a Saturday afternoon rally in Minneapolis to keep 

up the fight for peace.</P>

<P>"A war will destroy Iraq," said Steger, who was at the rally with two members 

of a delegation that spent 10 days in Iraq. "There is no such thing as a war against 

a government or a president.</P>

<P>"War is against people," he said, "Only people."</P>

<P>The rally marked the 12th anniversary of the imposition of sanctions on Iraq 

and the 57th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. 

It came as the Bush administration is saying it might use military force to oust 

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Saddam has barred U.N. weapons inspectors from 

returning to the country. </P>

<P>Iraq remains under tight U.N. sanctions until inspectors are allowed back in 

the country to ensure that Saddam no longer has chemical, nuclear or biological 

weapons or missiles to deliver them.</P>

<P>Steger was joined by Kathy Kelly, founder of <a href="http://www.nonviolence.org/vitw/" target="_new">Voices 

in the Wilderness</a>, a campaign aimed at ending economic sanctions against Iraq. 

She has gone there 16 times.</P>

<P>Kelly said that children are most affected by the sanctions and that about 

5,000 children under the age of 5 die every month in Iraq. They are poisoned by 

contaminated water; die from dysentery, cholera and diarrhea, or die from respiratory 

infections, she said. She talked of visiting schools and hospitals, neither with 

enough supplies to do their work.</P>

<P>"We have a huge responsibility," she said. "Cuff yourself to your congressperson&#39;s 

desk and say, &#39;We don&#39;t need a new war." &#39;</P>

<P>Samantha Smart, who attended the rally with her two children, ages 7 and 5, 

said she thinks her generation has failed in the fight for peace.</P>

<P>"If we were doing what we should, there would be 100,000 people in the park 

today," she said. "It is up to our children to carry the struggle for justice."</P>
