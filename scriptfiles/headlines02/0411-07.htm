With a rallying cry of "Donate the Dollars, Treat the People, Drop the Debt," public health experts, religious leaders, and AIDS activists gathered Wednesday to demand that the United States Congress increase its contributions to a global fund aimed at combating the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and eliminating the debt burdens carried by some of the poorest African nations.

<p>

"We are asking Congress and the President to take the appropriate action, nothing more," said actor and AIDS activist Danny Glover from the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. Wednesday. "In the face of unprecedented disaster we call on you to put life above profit. It's about moral action," he added.

<p>







The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, created by United Nations  Secretary General Kofi Annan  last year, has received US&#36;5 billion worth of requests for help but has less than &#36;1 billion at its disposal. To help reduce the shortfall, AIDS activists want Congress to add &#36;750 million to an emergency supplemental budget request under consideration by Congress this week.

<p>







According to activists--who also want Congress to significantly raise the Bush administration's 2003 budget request for the Fund from &#36;200 million to &#36;2.5 billion--the need for greater funds is most evident in Africa, where many countries lack the resources to buy life-prolonging medicines. More than 15 million people have died from AIDS on the continent, and more than 90 percent of new cases are occurring in those aged under 15.

<p>







Uganda has reduced HIV  prevalence from 30 percent to below 10 percent by taking an aggressive approach and investing in improved treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, giving pregnant women a drug that prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and expanding testing for the virus, said former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates  in an opinion article carried by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> April 7.

<p>







"The more we realize that pennies a day can save millions of lives, the more we should insist that the world's wealthiest nation continue to increase its health aid and take a lead role in ending this disease," Carter and Gates argued.

<p>







One reason that AIDS continues to hit Africa so hard, activists argue, is that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund continue to collect large debt payments that leave poor countries with few resources to devote to buying medicines, expanding healthcare, or educating their population about AIDS prevention.

<p>







"Every dollar spent on servicing the debt is a dollar not spent on HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention," noted Mara Vanderslice of Jubilee USA, which advocates bold debt relief for the world's poorest countries. The group cites progress in the battle against AIDS in countries such as Uganda, Malawi, and Cameroon which are part of a World Bank debt-reduction plan that leaves them with more funds to invest in a broad range of health programs - from training new nurses to promoting behavior changes.

<p>







While most senators support an increase of &#36;700 million for the Fund this year, and another &#36;2 billion in 2003, Republican Senator Jesse Helms--who has recently taken an interest in AIDS, apparently as a result of talks with U2 rock star Bono--would like to increase U.S. AIDS funding by only &#36;500 million and make it contingent on raising matching funds from the private sector.

<p>







Decisions on numbers and whether any increase should go directly to the Fund or to programs sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development are up for debate this week during Senate discussions on the supplemental budget request.

<p>







Referring to the lower level of funding being offered by the U.S, Glover told a cheering crowd, "If your neighbor's house is burning down, you don't hand him a cup of water. You help him put out the fire. America must not be a nation of passive onlookers; we must not remain silent when 8,000 people are dying everyday from an illness that can be treated."
