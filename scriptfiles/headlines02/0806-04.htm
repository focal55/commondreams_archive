<p>Delegations from 174 countries which are meeting for nine days to try to cure 

the world's environment and development problems later this month will have to 

do it without the help of Britain's environment minister, Michael Meacher. 

<P>The conference, seen by many as a talking shop and too unwieldy to produce 

concrete results, takes place 10 years after the first <a href="http://www.earthsummit2002.org/" target="_new">Earth 

Summit</a> in Rio and is designed to assess progress and give new impetus to the 

political process. 

<P>A staggering 65,000 people have registered to attend the conference in Johannesburg, 

which will be turned into a fortress for nine days with 27,000 police enforcing 

security. Every hotel room and boarding house and many holiday flats have been 

taken over by the government to squeeze everyone in. 

<P>At least 10,000 of those attending will be government officials, and 6,000 

will be journalists. Each head of government will be allotted 10 minutes to speak. 

<P>There are 20 UN bodies, each with their own delegation. A second parallel conference 

attended by environment groups, big business, the landless poor, and hundreds 

of lobby groups, from bird-watchers to the oil industry, has already attracted 

15,000 registrations. Each of these groups will also send separate delegations 

to lobby the main conference. It is so complex that no one is sure it will work, 

still less achieve anything. 

<P>But the conference takes place against an alarming backdrop of famine in Southern 

Africa, caused partly by climate change which is reducing rainfall, and the steady 

destruction of the earth's natural resources, and lack of clean water and sanitation. 

The failure to reach many of the UN's development targets and reduction in world 

poverty by promoting development and education will be top of the agenda. 

<P><B> Poverty targets</B>

<P>More than 100 heads of state will arrive in the last two days of the conference 

to sign a declaration designed to set new targets on poverty and development aid. 

Among the issues that Tony Blair will be pushing is the plight of two billion 

people in the world who are without electricity, many in rural Africa. 

<P>The problem is that unlike Rio there are no great new conventions to be signed. 

At the first summit the Climate Change Convention, designed to combat global warming, 

and the Biodiversity Convention, to protect vulnerable species and protect the 

natural world, were agreed and signed, giving high hopes of a brighter future. 

<P>In addition developing countries got together and set up an agreement to combat 

the spread of the world's deserts. An attempt was made to get a forest convention, 

but this proved impossible and despite years of subsequent talks failed to materialize.

<P>Apart from those agreements, a vast document called Agenda 21, a blueprint 

for the environment and development in the 21st century, was agreed and signed. 

Every local authority was supposed to create a plan for sustainable development 

under the slogan "think globally, act locally". Many in Britain have adopted Agenda 

21 policies with varied success. 

<P>This time the agenda has changed. Big businesses, particularly multinationals, 

are now charged with pouring money into developing countries and creating partnerships 

with local people to aid development. The idea is to improve social, environment 

and economic advancement all in one go, under the catch-all phrase of sustainable 

development. This is really what the summit is supposed to be about, how to encourage 

economic development of the poorest countries without further damaging their environment 

and destroying yet more natural resources like forests. A phrase that will be 

repeated again and again in Johannesburg will be "not leaving the earth for our 

children in a worse state than we found it". 

<P>As at Rio the main problem will be seen as the role of the US. There have been 

many preparatory meetings, but the US delegation, numbering more than 130, has 

been accused by environment groups of obstructing any attempts to impose new targets 

and timetables on relieving poverty and promoting development. 

<P>So little progress had been made after the "last" preparation meeting in Bali 

in June that many feared that Johannesburg would be a complete failure. Another 

meeting was hastily arranged for New York last month to try to pin down some concrete 

proposals. 

<P>Still undecided is whether George Bush will attend. The conference, which was 

to have been in the first two weeks in September, was moved back to run from August 

26 to September 4, to avoid the September 11 anniversary and allow the president 

to attend. 

<P>Like his father, who was US president during the Rio conference, Mr Bush is 

less than enthusiastic about the environment and development aid. In 1992 George 

Bush senior refused to sign the Biodiversity Convention in case it cost the US 

money but he did go to Rio and endorsed the Climate Change Convention. 

<P>His son is even more antagonistic towards the environment, and although the 

US remains part of the climate convention, the new president pulled out of the 

subsequent Kyoto agreement which would have given the convention teeth. 

<P>The rest of the world has continued with Kyoto, a snub to the US, which is 

now seen as an international environmental pariah, at least in the eyes of the 

green movement. 

<P>As at the Rio summit there will be a split between the northern developed countries 

which regard Johannesburg as a vital step to safeguarding the environment as well 

as promoting development, and the developing world, which looks on it as an opportunity 

for more aid to promote industry and clean technology. 

<P><B> Leap forward</B>

<P> But in the 10 years since Rio the aims of development and environment groups 

have got much closer. There has been a vast growth in the environment movement 

in developing countries. They do not want to repeat the mistakes of the industrial 

revolution of Europe and the US where air pollution and toxic wastes wrecked large 

areas. The developing countries want to leap from the 19th century to the 21st 

without the mess in between. 

<P>To this end they find a sympathetic ear in Mr Blair, who wants to switch the 

lights on in Africa using technologies like wind and solar power. This will have 

the dual effect of allowing a leap forward in education using computers and other 

technology, and at the same time prevent the further destruction of trees used 

daily for fuel. 

<P>The other great issues are lack of clean water and sanitation, which cause 

millions of deaths a year among children from avoidable diseases. Africa is particularly 

prone to virulent forms of malaria, which is spreading to ever increasing areas 

of the globe because of climate change. 

<P>Biodiversity and its continued destruction are again on the agenda and how 

to keep the food supplies going for ever increasing human populations. The world's 

population of 6 billion population will grow to 8 billion in less than 50 years. 

<P>With multinationals and environment groups sending delegations as large as 

any government's, trade and globalization will be a simmering issue. Many see 

the greater emphasis in Johannesburg on big business helping to solve the world's 

problems as a further erosion of the power of governments, and a lack of political 

will to make the summit a success.
