<p>NEW DELHI -- Unlike their Western counterparts, India's antinuclear activists are a lonely bunch.</p>

<p>But talk of a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan has suddenly raised their profile with a recent cover story in the country's leading news magazine, India Today, showing people fleeing a giant mushroom cloud and a headline, "What If?"</p>

<p>Still, India's antinuclear movement says there is huge ignorance about the devastating consequences of a nuclear war in a country where hundreds of millions of people have to devote their energy to eking out a subsistence living.</p>

<p>"People in India are preoccupied with everyday problems and don't know what nuclear weapons are - they don't even know the fact that even a 'limited' nuclear war can kill millions," said Achin Vanaik, an executive member of the Coalition for Nuclear Peace and Disarmament.</p>

<p>In India, antinuclear activists are often accused of being unpatriotic because the country's membership in the nuclear club is seen by many as affirmation of its big power status, Vanaik said in an interview.</p>

<p>The antinuclear coalition, which bands together doctors, scientists, academics, social activists and writers, and runs on a shoestring out of members' homes, was founded two years after India held nuclear tests in 1998.</p>

<p>Those explosions were followed by tit-for-tat blasts by Pakistan with which India has fought three wars - two of them over the disputed Kashmir region, which is also the trigger for the latest crisis.</p>

<p>"Our argument then was: 'Don't add a new layer of frightening tension. It's a stupid and bad thing to do,' " said Vanaik, coauthor of a book, <i>South Asia On A Short Fuse,</i> and a Third World Studies expert. "What we said then was valid and correct."</p>

<p>Analysts say the imminent threat of war has receded over the last few days with a promise by Pakistan to halt "cross-border infiltration of terrorists" into the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, where a separatist revolt has raged since 1989.</p>

<p>But the next days and weeks will be crucial as India assesses whether Pakistan has honored its pledge, and many analysts say that if a conflict does erupt, it could escalate into a nuclear conflict.</p>

<p>A U.S. Defense Department study says an all-out nuclear war in South Asia could kill nine million to twelve million people and injure two million to seven million.</p>

<p>Jane's Strategic Weapons Systems in London estimates that New Delhi has between 100 and 150 nuclear warheads and Pakistan 25 to 50.</p>

<p>While civil authorities make preparations for a possible war, there are no public shelters for the 13 million people in the capital, New Delhi, which is seen as a prime target for a nuclear attack.</p>

<p>Even in the event of conventional attack, India's medical system, notoriously overcrowded, would be unable to cope, experts say.</p>

<p>Antinuclear campaigners such as Vanaik have long said there is no point in civil defense for a country as big as India with its population of more than one billion, arguing that the best thing would be to rid the region of nuclear weapons altogether.</p>

<p>Vanaik said he did not believe a nuclear war between the neighbors was inevitable but was a "real possibility."</p>

<p>He said there were crucial differences between the Cold War of the former communist Soviet Union and West and the confrontation between India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>In the Cold War, the disagreements were ideological, he said. But the differences between mainly Hindu but officially secular India and Islamic Pakistan have been fed by religious extremism.</p>

<p>"Feelings are much more venomous than they were between the Soviet Union and the U.S.," Vanaik said. Enhancing the risks is the fact that "hostility between India and Pakistan has existed for 55 years [of independence] and shows no signs of diminishing."</p>

<p>"Nuclear war is not a worst-case scenario, it's a real-case scenario," he said.</p>
