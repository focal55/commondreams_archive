JENIN, West Bank (Reuters) - Israeli forces fired on a market in the West Bank 

city of Jenin Friday, killing two people and wounding dozens after Palestinians 

mistakenly thought a curfew had been lifted, Palestinian witnesses said. 

<p>The Israeli army had no immediate comment. 



<p>Ambulances raced to a local hospital, where officials said they were overwhelmed by the number of casualties. 



<p>"People thought the curfew was no longer on. They got hungry and wanted bread, so they went to the market to buy some. The Israelis opened fire," Jenin's acting governor, Haider Irsheid, told Reuters. 



<p>Hospital officials said a seven-year-old girl and the deputy director of the 

city's department of education were killed and dozens of people were wounded. 

Israeli troops pushed into Jenin, a city it describes as a "terrorists' nest" 

on Tuesday, after a suicide bombing killed 19 people on a Jerusalem bus.</p>
