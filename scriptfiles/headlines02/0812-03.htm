<p>McROBERTS, Ky. — People in Chopping Block Hollow, an old coal hamlet that corkscrews 

handsomely down the side of Dunham Mountain, used to speak in awe of "the 50-year 

flood" that swept through their homes after a drenching storm in 1957.</p>

<P> But that historic reference has been washed away this year as residents have 

repeatedly had to muck out their houses and businesses. They aim their anger up 

the mountain at a mining technique aptly named mountaintop removal.</p>

<P> "Every time we get a rain now it's the 50-year flood, what with all the destruction 

coming off that mountain," says Betty Collins, who complained of shoveling four-inch-deep 

mud and mine silt off her property after five rainfalls since May.</p>

<P> Hollow dwellers insist that the lucrative blasting and grinding away of the 

mountaintop for its coal in the last four years have stripped their hillsides 

of vegetation, obliterated streams and drainage patterns and turned the hollow 

into an overflowing funnel every time rain drains off the mining plateau being 

created above their houses.</p>

<P> Coal producers dispute that, insisting that mountaintop removal actually makes 

them more sensitive to the communities below. But residents here say company efforts 

at reclamation are cosmetic, and they hoot at the industry's environmental awards 

to mountaintop mining companies.</p>

<P> "The company and government inspectors tell us the rain's an act of God," 

said Betty Banks, who lives here. "Well it wasn't God who went up on our mountain 

with a 'dozer to leave it naked. They are destroying us here." Ms. Banks said 

her property had not flooded in 40 years before decapitation of the mountain.</p>

<P> Complaints from communities whose residents once earned most of their livelihoods 

from coal are increasing across Appalachia. People resent living in the shadow 

and dust of mountaintop removal, with waste routinely dumped into the valleys. 

Here, as in other back-road hamlets, people are starting to organize. They are 

forming a local chapter of <a href="http://www.kftc.org/" target="_new">Kentuckians 

for the Commonwealth</a>, a nonprofit citizens' lobby that recently scored a stunning 

court victory against the corporate and political interests in Appalachia long 

known as Big Coal.</p>

<P> In response to complaints by Kentuckians for the Commonwealth about mountaintop 

removal on the West Virginia border, Judge Charles Haden II of Federal District 

Court in Charleston, W.Va., ordered a halt last May to new mining permits. The 

permits had allowed hundreds of streams to be buried under rock and dirt in violation 

of environmental laws, Judge Haden said. His ruling is being appealed, and business 

and political leaders predict a reversal.</p>

<P> But the lawsuit is becoming a rallying flag in the coal regions of Appalachia. 

Judge Haden's name is invoked with the reverence accorded in the old days to Joe 

Hill, the mine union martyr.</p>

<P> Gale A. Norton, the interior secretary, recently sought an office meeting 

in Appalachia with the <a href="http://www.ohvec.org/" target="_new">Ohio Valley 

Environmental Coalition</a> and six other groups critical of mountaintop removal. 

But the groups declined, proposing instead a longer day to see the problems firsthand.</p>

<P> "We respectfully decline to let our organizations be used in what would be 

mostly a public relations gimmick," said Frank Young, president of the <a href="http://www.wvhighlands.org/" target="_new">West 

Virginia Highlands Conservancy</a>. The groups complained that the government 

was intent on weakening laws against the abuses of mountaintop mining.</p>

<P> "There's good mining and there's bad mining," said Lucious Thompson, who lives 

in Tom Biggs Hollow nearby. Mr. Thompson joined Kentuckians for the Commonwealth 

when he found his land disrupted from above.</p>

<P> "Mountaintop removal takes the coal quick, 24 hours every day, making my streams 

disappear, with the blasting knocking a person out of bed and the giant 'dozers 

beep-beeping all night so you cannot sleep," Mr. Thompson said with the authority 

of a gray-bearded retiree from Appalachia's underground mines.</p>

<P> With underground mining, coal miners led quieter, more pastoral lives above 

harsh workplaces deep in the ground and far out of sight. With mountaintop removal, 

a fast, high-volume process that uses mammoth machinery to decapitate the coal-rich 

hills that help define the hollows, the residents have become witnesses more than 

miners.</p>

<P> "They make monster funnels of our villages," said Carroll Smith, judge-executive 

— the top elected county official — in Letcher County, Ky. The hollows in his 

county that adjoin mountaintop removal sites have had some of the worst flooding.</p>

<P> "They haven't been a real good neighbor at all," Mr. Smith said of the mountaintop 

mining company.</p>

<P> The company, <org idsrc="NYSE" value="TE-T;TE-U">TECO Energy</org> Inc. of 

Tampa, Fla., firmly rejects that assessment. "Saying we're not good neighbors 

— that's very upsetting to the people who work for TECO Coal," said Laura Plumb, 

a company spokeswoman.</p>

<P> Years of letting residents dump garbage into the streams and permitting home 

building to impede waterways had contributed more to the flooding than had mountaintop 

mining, Ms. Plumb said.</p>

<P> "Mining does take a toll on the land while it's occurring," Ms. Plumb conceded. 

"However, when we're done we reclaim the area to better standards than before."</p>

<P> Such statements compound the local fury.</p>

<P> "State authorities tell us what the company is doing is legal, and I tell 

them it may be legal, but it's wrong," Mr. Smith said at an organizational meeting 

in Mrs. Banks's house, where residents passed around snapshots of the latest rain 

damage.</p>

<P> "A meeting like this couldn't have happened in the old days of coal; they 

would have found a way to bust it up," he said. He is confident, he added, that 

Chopping Block Hollow has some fight left in it.</p> </p>
