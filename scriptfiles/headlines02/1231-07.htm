</table></font>Speaking after the United Nations approved tougher  sanctions to prevent Baghdad from importing goods which could  be used in war, Annan said Iraq was cooperating with  inspections demanded by the Security Council.<p>



		He said he saw no need for military action until the  inspectors searching for suspected weapons of mass destruction  report back to the council, probably on January 27.<p>



		"Iraq is cooperating and they (inspectors) are able to do  their work in an unimpeded manner and therefore I don't see an  argument for a military action now," Annan said in an interview  with Israel's Army Radio monitored in Jerusalem.<p>



		"They may give an interim report before the 27th and I  really do not see any basis for an action until then,  particularly as they are able to carry out their work in an  unimpeded manner."<p>



		U.N. arms experts swooped on at least eight suspect sites  in central Iraq Tuesday, pushing ahead despite the new year.<p>



		Among the sites visited, witnesses said a team from the  U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission  (UNMOVIC) drove to a military base in Fallujah, northwest of  Baghdad. They said the facility is used to train officers in  chemical warfare.<p>



		"WORK OF GANGS"<p>



		Despite Annan's insistence that inspections were proceeding  smoothly, the chief of a missile facility which was scrutinized  by inspectors Monday accused them of behaving like gangsters.<p>



		"A team of 25 inspectors stormed into the plant...in a way  never seen before and in a manner similar to the work of  gangs," director of the facility Mohammad Hussein told  reporters.<p>



		The United States has declared Baghdad in material breach  of a Security Council resolution passed in November giving Iraq  one last chance to disarm. Baghdad says it has no banned  weapons.<p>



		Monday, the United States won approval for a new Security  Council resolution, co-sponsored by Britain, which named goods  such as drugs, trucks and boats that cannot be imported by Iraq  without prior approval.<p>



		The 15-nation council voted 13-0 to expand the list of  civilian goods under sanctions. Russia and Syria abstained.<p>



		Iraqi envoy Mohammed S. Ali said the resolution would  aggravate the suffering of the Iraq people, which could be  eased only by a lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's  1990 invasion of neighboring Kuwait.<p>



		The resolution modified a 300-page "goods review list"  itemizing goods that Iraq is barred from importing without  first obtaining Security Council approval on a case-by-case  basis.<p>



		Additions to the list range from drugs to protect Iraqi  soldiers from both anthrax and poison gas to boats similar to  the one used in the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen two years  ago. Electronic gear that could jam global positioning systems  used to guide some U.S. smart bombs will also come under  review.<p>



		PRICE TO PAY<p>



		The New York Times reported Tuesday that White House Budget  Director Mitchell Daniels estimated the cost of a war with Iraq  at from $50 billion to $60 billion, well below earlier  estimates from other administration officials.<p>



		A spokesperson for Daniels disputed the report, saying the  budget director was referring to the cost of the 1991 Gulf War  rather than projecting the cost of a potential war with Iraq.<p>



		Daniels, in a telephone interview with the paper, would not  provide specific costs for either a long or a short military  campaign to oust President Saddam Hussein. But he said that the  administration was budgeting for both, the article said.<p>



		"This is nothing more than prudent contingency planning,"  Daniels was quoted as saying. "At this point there is no war."<p>



		German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, providing the logic  for a possible reversal in his strong anti-war stance, said  that force was sometimes needed against dictators.<p>



		"We Germans know from our own experience that sometimes  only violence can stop dictators," Schroeder said in his New  Year's televised address to the nation. "But we also know what  bombs, destruction and losses at home mean for people."<p>



		The U.S. Central Command said in a statement that U.S. and  British aircraft used precision-guided weapons to target Iraqi  air defense targets in strikes Monday.<p>



		It was the fourth day in five that Western aircraft  attacked Iraqi targets in the southern no-fly zone.
