HANOI   - The U.S. government and chemical firms that sold it Agent Orange had a moral duty to compensate Vietnamese who have suffered from exposure to the toxic defoliant in the Vietnam War, U.S. veterans said on Monday.

</table>Members of the <a href="http://www.vva.org/" target="_new">Vietnam Veterans of America</a>, the driving force behind a scientific conference on Agent Orange and dioxin that opened in Hanoi on Sunday, said they hoped it would bring a better deal for both their members and the Vietnamese. 



<p>The conference has brought together Vietnamese and U.S. government scientists and dioxin experts worldwide to assess current knowledge about the effects of Agent Orange and map out future research paths. 



<p>Paul Sutton, head of the VVA's Agent Orange/Dioxin committee, whose three children were born with birth defects he believes were caused by his exposure to the toxic chemical said the U.S. government and the makers of the defoliant -- Dow Chemical Co and Monsanto Co -- shared a responsibility to compensate victims. 



<p>"This is a very thorny issue that has to be worked out," he said. "We, in our organization, certainly think that there should be a fair and equitable compensation or an ability to solve the health problems in this population in this country." 



<p>U.S. forces dumped millions of gallons of defoliants on Vietnam from 1962 until 1971 when spraying was halted after it was discovered they contained the most dangerous form of highly toxic dioxin, TCDD, and caused cancer in rats. 



<p>The veterans and Vietnam blame Agent Orange for numerous illnesses including: physical and mental birth defects, cancers, diabetes and nervous disorders. 



<p>Vietnam estimates more than a million of its people were exposed to the spraying, which it blames for tens of thousands of birth defects. Washington argues the scientific evidence is inconclusive and more research is needed. 



<p>"This has been their line all along," said Sutton. "They are worried it might end up costing them millions and millions of dollars to do something they could have solved 40 years ago." 



<p>The U.S. embassy made clear on Sunday Washington was not going to entertain Vietnamese compensation claims. 



<p>"U.S. Vietnam-relations were normalized in 1995 after Vietnam dropped claims war reparations/compensation," it said. "At the time of normalization, neither compensation nor reparations were granted or contemplated for the future." 



<p>Sutton and VVA president Thomas Corey, said it was difficult to say how much compensation might be in order, but described a $184 million settlement reached by the chemical firms with U.S. veterans in 1984 as "chump change." 



<p>More than 100,000 U.S. veterans have filed claims for help with illnesses related to Agent Orange, but only 7,500 are currently receiving assistance.
