</table></font>It is one of the world's most famous photographs. The body of 13-year-old Hector 

Petersen, the first child to die in the 1976 Soweto Uprising against apartheid 

in which more than 1000 black children were killed across South Africa, is being 

carried by a schoolmate. Next to the two boys is Petersen's youngest sister, Lulu, 

consumed by grief and crying uncontrollably. 

<p>Now Lulu Petersen is in the world spotlight, at the center of a lawsuit that 

could cost American and Swiss banks more than $50 billion in reparations for their 

collaboration with South Africa's 1948-1993 apartheid governments. 

<p>The American lawyer representing the four initial plaintiffs, including Petersen, 

is Ed Fagan who helped to force Swiss banks into paying about $1.25bn to families 

of Holocaust victims. Fagan's legal team lodged the class action suit against 

Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS and America's largest financial institution, 

Citicorp Bank, on June 16, the 26th anniversary of Hector Petersen's death and 

the first day of the Soweto Uprising. The legal team expects hundreds of thousands 

of South Africans to join the suit. A special telephone hotline has been set up 

in South Africa for people who want to join the case. 

<p>A class action suit occurs when a group of people -- as opposed to an individual 

-- sues a company. The action by the Apartheid Reparations International Legal 

Claim is being made in New York under United States laws that permit non-US citizens 

to file claims of human rights abuses and torture in that country's courts -- 

provided the company concerned has US operations. 

<p>Lawyers for the complex lawsuit, which could drag on for years, said they plan 

to target more international banks and other companies, including some in Britain, 

France and Germany. German computer companies will be targeted because they provided 

the technology for the implementation of the infamous pass system which required 

all blacks, banned from the streets in white areas after dark, to carry passes 

at all times.

</table></font></font>Lulu Petersen, standing at the Hector Petersen memorial in Soweto, told reporters 

that she and her fellow plaintiffs want reparations from the international banks 

that 'profited from the blood and misery of our fathers and mothers, our brothers 

and sisters'. 

<p> Fagan, in his initial submission, linked the apartheid-era governments to 

Nazi ideology. He said: 'In 1948, in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust, a racially 

exclusive government, led by supporters of a Nazi victory in the second world 

war, took power in South Africa.' He quoted Colonel Craig Williamson, a senior 

secret agent in the apartheid era's BOSS (the Bureau of State Security), who told 

South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) : 'Our weapons, ammunition, 

uniforms, vehicles, radios and other equipment were all developed by industry. 

<p>'Our finances and banking were done by foreign bankers who even gave us credit 

for covert operations.' Fagan argued that were it not for the 'conspiracy' of 

banks such as Citicorp, Credit Suisse and UBS, apartheid could not have been prolonged 

for as long as it was. 

<p>He added: 'For justice to be done, the financial institutions and companies 

that fueled and made possible the apartheid regime's reign of terror must account 

for their sins, crimes and profiteering -- just as did the companies that fueled 

and made possible the Nazi reign of terror.' 

<p>The other claimants with Lulu Petersen include Sigqibo Mpendulo, Lungisile 

Ntsebeza and Themba Makubela. Mpendulo, a former anti-apartheid activist who fled 

into exile, is the father of 12-year-old twin brothers, Samora and Sadat, who 

were shot dead with three friends in a 1993 apartheid undercover death squad raid 

as they all slept in front of a television in their Transkei home. The man alleged 

by Fagan to have authorized the raid was President FW de Klerk who, at the time, 

was about to travel to Oslo to accept, with Nelson Mandela, the 1993 Nobel Peace 

Prize. 

<p>Ntsebeza is the brother of Dumisa Ntsebeza, the sharp chief investigator for 

South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission -- prominent in scrutiny of 

Winnie Mandela for alleged violence against and murder of township children -- 

and now one of the lead counsels under Fagan for the Apartheid Reparations International 

Legal Claim. Dumisa said: 'The claim is justified because the banks and other 

multinationals knew that the United Nations had declared apartheid as a crime 

against humanity.' 

<p>

<p>Makubela fled abroad after refusing to testify against Lungisile Ntsebeza in 

a political trial. Victims of apartheid human rights abuses were promised reparations 

by the TRC. However, the reparation process has become bogged down as the South 

African government waits for the TRC's final report and balks at the potential 

reparations bill -- estimated to run into many hundreds of millions of dollars. 

<p> Fagan has achieved a measure of notoriety for the way he operates and attracts 

media attention, thus increasing pressure on the other side in his cases. His 

method is to go for the biggest companies on the biggest issues -- and there are 

hardly many issues bigger than the Holocaust and apartheid. He lifted legal battles 

into the realm of public relations when he became involved in the fire in an Austrian 

tunnel in 2000 in which 155 people died, and in the row over BSE which he said 

was spread in Europe by companies ignoring warnings about the dangers of animal 

feed. 

<p>Fagan knows, like many rich and famous lawyers, that the law often needs a 

good kick. Swiss banks, for example, fobbed off for half a century relatives of 

Holocaust victims who sought their families' missing money -- until Fagan came 

along and shamed them into settling. Last week, angry Swiss people in Zurich heckled 

Fagan as he arrived to present his apartheid lawsuit. He was forced to move the 

site of his press conference. The best guess among lawyers is that the banks will 

offer substantial compensation rather than face the scrutiny and adverse publicity 

of an extended court action that would be ruthlessly exploited by Fagan's publicists. 

<p>If Fagan wins the apartheid lawsuit, he and his legal team will receive at 

least 30% of the award as fees. In the event of victory, one man who will not 

benefit is Mbuyisa Makhubu, the boy carrying Hector Petersen in that famous photograph. 

Makhubu wanted to be a priest, and had become a political activist by the time 

of the incident of June 16, 1976. He was horrified by Petersen's violent death 

in a hail of police bullets. The traumatized Makhubu fled to Nigeria more than 

20 years ago and has never been heard of since. There are rumors that he got involved 

with the Nigerian drug scene and might have drowned while attempting to swim across 

a river.</p>
