<p>The town officially goes by the name of <a href="http://www.stricom.army.mil/PRODUCTS/ITS/" target="_new">Shughart 

Gordon</a> - a cluster of buildings set in forests that could be almost anywhere 

in the world. But in the minds of the soldiers of the 101st Airborne who stormed 

it, it was Baghdad. 

<P>Troops from the division's 3rd Brigade fought from house to house in this mock-up 

settlement, as part of an exercise intended to get them ready for their next battle, 

only a few months after their return from Afghanistan. 

<P>Most of the 600 soldiers in the exercise believe that if an invasion of Iraq 

is ordered, the highly mobile 101st Airborne, the "screaming eagles", will be 

among the first units sent in. And they are aware that the endgame against Saddam 

Hussein's special republican guard is likely to be fought out in Baghdad, in Tikrit 

- the Iraqi dictator's home town - and other urban areas. They would be full of 

civilians, snipers and booby traps. 

<P>Perhaps that is why the planners of the war game chose the name Shugart Gordon 

for the fictional Baghdad. Urban warfare has given US military planners bad dreams 

since the assault on the Somali capital Mogadishu in 1993, when two Black Hawk 

helicopters were shot down and 18 American soldiers were killed in the labyrinth 

of the capital. 

<P>Shughart Gordon is named after two of those dead soldiers. 

<P>Along with a chemical or biological attack, urban warfare is the US army's 

biggest nightmare. 

<P>That goes for Private First Class Mark Meshreky too. "Urban warfare is the 

number one worry," Private Meshreky said. "You've got to have 360-degree vision. 

In Afghanistan, around Kandahar it was just a desert. You could see in every direction. 

Here, you've got to see around every corner." 

<P>Even through the camouflage paint on his face, it was clear that Private Meshreky 

was exhausted. He had not slept for more than 30 hours, but as the sun came up 

over Shughart Gordon, he beamed with the elation of a survivor, as dozens of fellow 

soldiers lay dead and wounded. 

<P>On this occasion, they had been hit by lasers fitted to the guns of the town's 

defenders, played with appropriate ferocity by two platoons from the 509th Parachute 

Regiment. The lasers are picked up by shiny black receptors on every uniform and 

helmet, that emit a whine when struck. Explosions are mimicked with ear-bursting 

effect by Hollywood-style pyrotechnics. 

<P>It is as close to real life as the army can make it. And these exercises, no 

matter how well orchestrated, can also be dangerous. Two soldiers were killed 

in a similar exercise last week when a tank ran over them. But much of the adrenalin 

in this particular war game was the knowledge that it could soon be played out 

for real in Iraq. 

<P>"It's kind of why we're doing this," said Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Sabb, 

who led the 15 Black Hawk helicopters used in the assault. "It's never away from 

our minds that the things we are doing here are going to happen to us in real 

life. 

<P>"We want to avoid an urban fight as much as possible. You have the danger of 

fratricide &#91;killing soldiers on your own side&#93;. And we don't want to hurt 

civilians. 

<P>"We'll be at a disadvantage out there because there's a lack of knowledge of 

what we're about. The regime's propaganda machine is at work. People of Iraq don't 

know we're not there to hurt them." 

<P>Lt Col Sabb's other big worry was in a satchel at his waist - his chemical 

and biological protection gear. While waiting for the war game assault, the helicopter 

squadron was attacked three times with chemical weapons. 

<P>In the final assault on Shughart Gordon, some of the 3rd Brigade's troops had 

to don protective gear to detonate what they thought could be a chemical booby 

trap. In the town's last stand, however, the defending forces opted not to use 

chemical or biological agents, on the grounds that it would be suicidal - a premise 

that might not hold in Iraq. 

<P>The demand for the war game facilities at Fort Polk is at an all-time high. 

The training base is normally dormant in December, but not this year. Next week, 

it is the turn of the 10th Mountain Division, another combat unit that fought 

in Afghanistan and could well play a role in Iraq. 

<P>The Louisiana base is a prime example of everything the US army is good at. 

It is a technological marvel which allows officers to watch the progress of the 

battle through hundreds of thermal imaging cameras and, through satellite positioning 

technology, to see individual platoons move across maps lit up on giant screens 

in a control center.

<P>In the cold night outside, however, the vastly superior American technology 

was of less use in close-quarters street fighting. A mighty MI Abrams tank was 

brought to a halt for more than an hour because barbed wire got tangled in its 

tracks. Dozens of troops were picked out by a single sniper before he could be 

found and killed with a tank shell. Total casualties from the exercise were not 

released. 

<P>It is clear from the hints seeping out of the Iraqi regime, that in the event 

of a US attack, President Saddam would not repeat the mistake he made 11 years 

ago of leaving his best troops out in the desert to be slaughtered by American 

air power. This time, he is more likely to pull back the special republican guard 

into Baghdad and Tikrit where civilians would serve as human shields. 

<P>The US military is trying to send a message, to say it is not afraid of going 

into the streets, which may in part explain why international journalists, including 

a television crew from the Arabic channel al-Jazeera, were invited to Fort Polk. 

<P>"If you show you're ready and willing to go in there and do it, then perhaps 

the Iraqis will think twice about it," said Gary Anderson, a retired marine colonel 

who is advising the Pentagon. "I think we have to show we won't be deterred by 

this kind of blackmail, or else we'd turn urban warfare into a bogey man, and 

we'll be held hostage by it."</p>
