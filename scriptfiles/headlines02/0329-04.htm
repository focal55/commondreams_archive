RAMALLAH, West Bank &#150;&#150;  Yasser Arafat's office came under heavy Israeli tank fire Friday as part of a raid on the Palestinian leader's compound. Arafat's aides said he was in the building but unharmed.<P>Arafat was in a windowless ground-floor room during the shelling of the building. His main office is on the third floor.<P>Israel has said it would not harm the Palestinian leader. However, intensive gunbattles were being waged in his compound between Israeli troops and his guards.<P>One guard was killed and 25 were wounded in the fighting.<P>During much of the day, Arafat was speaking to world leaders by phone or watching events on television. He gave several live interviews to Arab satellite television stations.<P>Israeli troops stormed Arafat's compound early Friday. Tank shells punched holes in the wall ringing the complex, and troops took over two buildings. Snipers set up positions on rooftops, giving them a clear view of Arafat's third-floor office.<P>In the afternoon, Israeli tanks that had been deployed near the entrance of the compound moved close to the office building and opened fire on it with shells and machine guns, Arafat's aides said.<P>Friday's attack marked the first time Arafat's office building was targeted. In the past 18 months of fighting, Israel has repeatedly shelled other buildings in the compound.<P>The incursion was the first phase of a wide-scale military operation against the Palestinians approved by the Israeli Cabinet after a string of Palestinian attacks that killed 27 people over the past three days. The Cabinet formally declared Arafat an enemy and said it would isolate him.<P>"Israeli snipers are on the roofs of all the buildings around Arafat's office, and they are shooting at anyone who dares to move in the compound," said Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, who was in the compound. "Israeli tanks are at Arafat's door, and they are not allowing anyone in or out."<P>The Palestinian leader's sprawling complex includes several buildings, including the three-story office where Arafat has been working and sleeping for the past four months while under a travel ban imposed by Israel.<P>Israeli soldiers demanded over a loudspeaker that Arafat's security guards surrender. Other officials said parts of the compound were on fire.<P>The Israeli troops knocked down some of the compound's walls, which stretch for a city block, before entering it, Abed Rabbo said. An Associated Press photographer at the scene said he saw both tanks and troops go inside.<P>Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Israel had no intention to harm Arafat physically, while Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon left open the possibility that Arafat could be expelled from the West Bank at a later stage.<P>Sharon confirmed in a news conference that Israeli forces were inside Arafat's compound, but would not give details of the Israeli operation.<P>Abed Rabbo said Sharon was attempting "to destroy the Palestinian Authority and the peace process and to harm President Arafat personally. Therefore we think that there is a need now for wide and immediate Arab, European and international intervention."
