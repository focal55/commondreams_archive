<p>WASHINGTON -- Saying there is little evidence of an imminent threat to the 

United States, the nation's Catholic bishops overwhelming approved a resolution 

Wednesday opposing President Bush's threatened war against Iraq. 

<P>By a 228-14 vote, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said the 

administration lacked "clear and adequate evidence" that military action against 

Saddam Hussein would be morally justified. 

<P>"We fear that to resort to war, under present circumstances and in light of 

current public information, would not meet the strict conditions in Catholic teaching 

for overriding the strong presumption against the use of military force," the 

prelates said. 

<P>The bishops made it clear they had "no illusions about the behavior or intentions 

of the Iraqi government," and they called on the Hussein regime to cease internal 

repression and "abandon its efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction." 

<P>They praised President Bush for working with the U.N. Security Council to persuade 

Iraq to disarm and for seeking congressional approval before taking military action.</p>
