British Prime Minister Tony Blair lined up behind the US portrayal of Iraq as part of an "axis of evil," saying Baghdad's development of weapons of mass destruction was a threat to world stability.

<p>In an interview with Australia's ABC television, a transcript of which was released here Thursday, Blair gave his strongest backing yet to US President George W. Bush's tough line on Saddam Hussein's regime.</p>

<p>The prime minister is said to be preparing to hold talks with Bush in April in Washington to finalize what action should be taken against Iraq as part of the "second phase" of the war against terrorism.</p>

<p>"I certainly agree with him (Bush) very strongly that weapons of mass destruction represent a real threat to world stability," Blair said in the interview.</p>

<p>He recalled how, speaking to parliament in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, he had said the next issue to be tackled after global terrorism was the issue of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>The development of such weapons were "a real threat," Blair told ABC, adding: "George Bush is right to draw attention to that ... It is important that we act against them.</p>

<p>"It is an issue that those who are engaged in spreading weapons of mass destruction are engaged in an evil trade and it is important that we make sure that we take action in respect of it."</p>

<p>Blair was speaking before leaving later Thursday for Australia for a summit of Commonwealth heads of state and government.</p>

<p>London has been Washington's staunchest ally in the campaign launched after the September 11 suicide plane atrocities, joining in military action and helping forge a US-led global coalition against terrorism.</p>

<p>The military action led to the ouster of Afghanistan's Taliban regime which sheltered the al-Qaeda group of Osama bin Laden, chief suspect for the attacks in New York and Washington.</p>

<p>Blair went on to praise the way Bush had handled events since the attacks on the US. "I think that George Bush has shown tremendous leadership since September 11," he said.</p>

<p>"I think he has acted always in a very measured way, in a calm way, but he is right to raise these issues and certainly he has our support in doing so."</p>

<p>He said he and Bush were in constant contact and agreed on the "general issues."</p>

<p>"We do constantly look at Iraq ... Saddam Hussein's regime is a regime that is deeply repressive to its people and is a real danger to the region.</p>

<p>"Heavens above, he used chemical weapons against his own people, so it is an issue and we have got to look at it, but we will look at it in a rational and calm way, as we have for the other issues.</p>

<p>"The accumulation of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq poses a threat, a threat not just to the region but to the wider world, and I think George Bush was absolutely right to raise it. Now what action we take in respect of that, that is an open matter for discussion.</p>

<p>"Since September 11 we have proceeded in a calm, measured, sensible way, by discussion and we will carry on doing so, but when we are ready to take action then we will announce it."</p>
