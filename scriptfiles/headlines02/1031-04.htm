<p> Despite the deaths of 119 hostages, Russia's success on Saturday in saving 

hundreds of others using a knockout gas against their bomb-toting captors in a 

Moscow theater is likely to boost efforts to develop similar "nonlethal" weaponry. 

<P>That's bad news to chemical arms control advocates, who fear the unraveling 

of 80 years of treaties that stemmed from worldwide revulsion at the use of poison 

gases in the trenches of Europe during World War I. 

<P>"There are very good reasons why chemical weapons were prohibited," said Edward 

Hammond, of the <a href="http://www.sunshine-project.org/" target="_new">Sunshine 

Project</a>, an Austin, Texas, group that has unearthed public documents about 

U.S. efforts to make such weapons. "The great fear is that this incident in Moscow 

will send us down a slippery slope. . . . It is very worrying to us that governments 

around the world are not condemning it." 

<P>Hammond said distinctions between lethal and nonlethal chemical weapons tended 

to blur quickly in a crisis. In the Moscow theater, the gas was clearly deadly 

to hostages and captors alike. Once the cap on chemical weapons use is lifted, 

Hammond fears, the full range of horrors made possible by modern chemistry becomes 

possible. 

<P>After days of international pressure, Moscow acknowledged Wednesday that the 

active ingredient in the incapacitating agent pumped into the theater was a form 

of fentanyl, a synthetic drug similar to morphine, but about about 80 times more 

potent. 

<P>In all likelihood, the Russian gas is an artifact of the Cold War. 

<P>"Both the United States and the former Soviet Union did a lot of research on 

incapacitants, including some related to morphine," said Eric Croddy, senior researcher 

at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. 

<P>But experts said fentanyl proved difficult to aerosolize and even harder to 

control safely, so it is unlikely Americans have stores of it, even in the nation's 

most secret warehouses. Use of such an agent in warfare is also strictly prohibited 

by treaties such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by the United States 

in 1997. 

<P>Proponents of the use of nonlethal weapons said rigid interpretation of those 

treaties prevented development of more humane weapons. 

<P>"People had been working on these things into the mid-1970s, then it became 

politically incorrect," said John Alexander, a retired colonel and author of "Future 

Wars," a book about nonlethal weaponry. "It's a real paradox. 

<P>The treaties were designed to prevent large-scale casualties and fatalities. 

But these are life-conserving technologies that are possible." 

<P>Alexander said that "the net has been cast too broadly" and that such treaties 

"need to be revisited." 

<P>Regardless, the United States has been conducting research on a range of incapacitating 

weapons for possible use in terrorist attacks or civil disturbances. Hammond maintains 

such work violates international law, and he accuses U.S. institutions of withholding 

public information about it. 

<P>Hammond has used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain documents detailing 

significant research in nonlethal weaponry. That research, described in nonclassified 

documents, discloses the development of a chemical-bearing mortar shell that can 

carry incapacitating gases a mile and a half from the firing point, and of microscopic 

capsules to carry and disperse nonlethal chemicals. 

<P>The Sunshine Project has been attempting since March to pry from the National 

Academy of Sciences a series of reports written in 1994 by Army chemical weapons 

experts on the use of "calmative agents," military argot for incapacitating agents. 

<P>"NAS has critical information for understanding the chemical agents used in 

Moscow, but it is refusing to release it because it wants to avoid embarrassing 

the Pentagon, which denies that this type of research exists in the United States," 

Hammond said in a press release. 

<P>Academy spokesman Bill Skane replied that the documents had been cleared as 

nonclassified but cannot be released without final clearance from the Department 

of Defense. The final sticking point has to do with concerns that the documents 

contain information that would be barred from disclosure abroad under export control 

rules governing the transfer of technology from one country to another. 

<P>"We're in the midst of a very long-lasting process," Skane said. 

<P>Although the law requires the academy to disclose nonclassified material, it 

cannot do so without the export control clearance. "We are caught between two 

responsibilities," Skane said. </p>
