<p>The bleak, barren land in Utah that was given to the Goshute Indians as their reservation in the 19th century could now turn the tribe's few remaining members into millionaires by becoming a nuclear waste dump - to the fury of the rest of the state. 

<P>The 70 members of the Goshutes have offered their inhospitable land in Skull Valley, Utah, to utility companies looking for a place to store 40,000 tons of highly radioactive nuclear waste in advance of the construction of a permanent site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. It is believed that the companies would pay about $48m (&#163;33m) to the tribe over 40 years for the use of the land, which is about 50 miles from Salt Lake City.  

<P>An agreement has already been reached between the tribe and the eight relevant utilities companies. Now it needs only approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to become a reality. An NRC staff report has already been completed and concluded that the site meets all requirements. The storage facility could open by 2005.  

<P>"We were given the land to use and this is how we want to use it," Leon Bear, a former security guard who is now the Goshute Indian tribal chairman, told the Los Angeles Times. He said that the tribe needed money for health care, housing and other social programs. He points out that the military already uses land near the reservation for incinerating chemical weapon stockpiles and as a bombing range.  

<P>The rest of the state views the plan with alarm. "I have one focus these days: to stop the storage facility from being licensed," said Utah's governor, Mike Leavitt. "We don't produce nuclear waste and we refuse to store it for those who do." The state has filed lawsuits to stop the site being built.  

<P>The reservations were given to Indian tribes as sovereign territory in the 19th century as a permanent settlement of land disputes with the federal government. In general, the tribes were given the most infertile and least desirable land.  

<P>Over the past decade, many tribes have found that casinos - which are illegal in most of the US - can provide the revenue they could never obtain from farming the land. But few imagined that a tribe might one day make its money from nuclear dumping and some members of the tribe are unhappy with the plan. "We're here to defend the land not destroy it," said Sammy Blackbear, a tribal member.  <P>Most Utah residents are also alarmed. Polls show that more than 80% are opposed to the reservation being used as a dump. The Yucca Mountain site also faces opposition - mostly from tribes in Nevada who claim the site would be built on their traditional lands.</p>
