President Bush  says the Mideast summit sponsored by former President Clinton   resulted in a "significant intefadeh," or uprising, repeating an accusation his press secretary got in trouble for uttering.

<p>

"It wasn't all that long ago where a summit was called and nothing happened, and as a result we had significant intefadeh in the area," Bush told Britain's ITV network in an interview taped for his weekend talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Twenty-five Palestinians have been killed in one of the bloodiest days since Israel began a military offensive in the West Bank, despite President George W. Bush's call for Israeli forces to withdraw. Any faint hopes raised by Bush's demand and a meeting between U.S. envoy Anthony Zinni and besieged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Friday were dashed by the heavy death toll in Palestinian cities and refugee camps on the West Bank.

</font>The Middle East crisis and Bush's decision to send Secretary of State Colin Powell  on a peacemaking mission will dominate their talks.

<p>

During his last months in office, Clinton was heavily engaged in pressing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat  and then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak  to strike an accord, but his intensive diplomacy &#151; capped by the 2000 Israeli-Palestinian summit at the Camp David presidential retreat &#151; failed.</p>

<p>

White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, defending Bush against criticism that he had not played an active peacemaking role in contrast to Clinton, noted to reporters in February that the 17-month Palestinian uprising broke out during Clinton's presidency.</p>

<p>

"In an attempt to shoot the moon and get nothing, more violence resulted," Fleischer said.</p>

<p>

Clinton's former national security adviser, Sandy Berger, lodged a complaint with Bush's national security chief, Condoleezza Rice. She asked Fleischer to retract his comment, though advisers said at the time that Fleischer reflected the president's privately held views.</p>

<p>

"No United States president, including President Clinton, is to blame for violence in the Middle East," Fleischer said in retraction.</p>

<p>

Aides said Friday that Bush was not blaming Clinton, either, but rather Arafat for missing opportunities to make peace with Israel &#151; both in 2000 and during Bush's presidency.</p>

<p>

Without mentioning Clinton by name, Bush said in the British television interview that a U.S. president should not call a summit without a good prospect for success.</p>

<p>

"The only time that's appropriate for a U.S. president to call a summit, when it looks like something can get done," he said.</p>

<p>

"The problem is, the American president, when he calls a summit, better get it right," Bush said. "If a summit fails, if the president ... lays it out there and nothing happens, generally the ... follow-up is worse than the status quo."</p>

<p>

Bush did not rule out sponsoring a Mideast summit down the line. "Someday you may say, `I remember when I talked to old Bush, and there he is, sitting there with a big summit.' But now is not the time for one. I've got a different strategy."</p>
