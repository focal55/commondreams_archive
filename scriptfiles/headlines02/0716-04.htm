<p>MOSCOW - Russia has condemned British and U.S. air strikes on Iraq, accusing 

them of complicating peace efforts in the Middle East and the Gulf, amid mounting 

speculation over U.S. plans to oust Saddam Hussein.

<p>The U.S. armed forces bombed what they said were military  targets in Iraq's southern "no-fly" zone on Saturday and  Sunday, striking a mobile radar unit and air defense  facilities.<p>Iraqi spokesmen said one person had been killed and six  were wounded when allied planes struck civilian targets on  Sunday. A further seven were hurt in strikes the previous day.<p>"Russia is convinced that such operations in illegitimate  "no-fly" zones complicate the efforts of the international  community to find a political and diplomatic solution to the  Iraqi problem, and to ease tensions in the Middle East and the  Gulf region," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement  late on Monday.<p>U.S. and British jets patrol "no-fly" zones in northern and  southern Iraq set up by Western powers after the 1991 Gulf War.  The Iraqi government does not recognize the zones, ostensibly  set up to protect minority populations from possible attacks by  Baghdad.<p>Russia, which has close economic ties with Baghdad, has  long spoken out against U.S. plans for military action against  Iraq, judged by Washington to be part of the "axis of evil"  along with Iran and North Korea.

<p>Washington, which accuses the "axis" of seeking to obtain weapons of mass destruction, 

says Iraq has been a threat since it invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf 

War.</span> </p>
