<p>UNITED NATIONS -  In a near-unanimous voice the United Nations General Assembly called on the United States on Tuesday to end its 42-year embargo against Cuba.

<p>



 





The vote marked the 11th consecutive year the 185-member General Assembly has adopted a resolution in favor of lifting the embargo. States voted 173 countries in favor, four abstentions and three against.

 <p>

 





Israel and the Marshall Islands were the only countries that sided with the United States.

 <p>

 







Delegates from country after country expressed serious concern over the U.S. blockade, which they said violates international law, infringing on Cuba's sovereignty. The resolution itself charges the United States with violating the ''purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations''.

 <p>

 





Not so, said the U.S. delegate.

 <p>

 





''The United States embargo against Cuba is strictly a matter of bilateral policy,'' Sichan Siv, U.S. representative to the U.N. economic and social council told delegates. ''It is not a subject which the General Assembly should spend valuable time considering.''

 <p>

 





Since 1992, when the General Assembly first adopted a resolution calling for an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade, the stance has been reiterated every year with increasingly greater support. Last year 167 countries voted in favor.

 <p>

 





The resolution will have special significance this year because it has not only the support of nearly all U.N. member states but also ''the majority of the people of the United States'', said Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of Cuba's national assembly.

 <p>

 





Many civil society groups and influential business concerns in the United States have advocated lifting the blockade and resuming normal economic activity with Cuba.

 <p>

 





USA Engage, a coalition of more than 670 small and large businesses, agricultural groups and trade associations makes regular appeals to end or reduce sanctions. ''Especially active in this regard are U.S. farmers, their organizations and major agricultural production and export companies,'' said de Quesada.

 <p>

 





Two years ago, Congress exempted food from the U.S. embargo, but banned official and private financing of food exports to Cuba, forcing Havana to pay for the goods in cash.

<p>







In the last 11 months, 712,000 tons of U.S. agricultural products, worth 140 million dollars, have arrived in Cuba, according to de Quesada. These sales galvanized U.S. food industry interest in trade with Cuba, and its members are now pushing for legislation that would allow U.S. banks to finance sales to Cuba.

<p>







But successive U.S. laws have strongly discouraged foreign countries from trading with Cuba.

<p>









For example, the representative of Denmark, speaking on behalf of the European Union (<a href="http://rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/oneworld/wl_oneworld/inlinks/*http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22European%20Union%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw">news</a> - <a href="http://rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/oneworld/wl_oneworld/inlinks/*http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?cs=nw&p=European%20Union">web sites</a>) on Tuesday, expressed concern over the extraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton Act of 1996. Under this legislation, the United States assumes the right to penalize countries that trade with Cuba.

<p>







Under the 1992 Cuba Democracy Act, commonly known in Cuba as the ''Torricelli Law'', cargo vessels from third countries are prevented from docking in U.S. ports if they have called in Cuba in the previous six months.

<p>







According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), last year proved to be one of the most difficult in Cuba in recent history, as a consequence of global economic slowdown, the fallout from the Sep. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States and poor production in the sugar sector.

<p>







''The embargo has served to exacerbate the effects of what was already a difficult year,'' ECLAC stresses.

<p>







The difficulty of importing certain medicines and other products made in the United States or by U.S. subsidiaries has a negative impact on the quality of services in Cuba.

<p>







Following Hurricane Michelle, which struck in November 2001, Cuba contacted 17 U.S. companies to purchase emergency medicines. Of these, only eight replied. Four did not make an offer and one said that it would not make an offer because it did not have a permit from the U.S. government, according to U.N. sources.

<p>







Medical supplies are not blocked by the embargo but, ECLAC explained, the embargo gives rise to an environment of uncertainty that discourages many entrepreneurs from seeking business with, making sales to or even visiting Cuba.

<p>







A recent study found that 59 new unilateral sanctions were imposed between 1997 and 2001, a significant decrease from the 1996 rate. In 1996 alone the U.S. administration imposed 26 new unilateral sanctions, says the study by the Washington-based International Business and Economic Law Program of Georgetown University.

<p>







In contrast to the general reduction of unilateral sanctions and a move toward more targeted 'smart' sanctions, ''the economic, commercial, financial and social coercive measures imposed on Cuba during the last four decades are still being implemented'', says Barry Carter, author of the study.

<p>







The question currently being debated among U.S. policy-makers is whether the embargo is an appropriate foreign policy instrument for achieving foreign policy goals.

<p>







The Cuba Working Group, comprising 40 U.S. lawmakers, equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, has proposed a nine-point plan to ease the embargo and promote bilateral trade and travel, but it falls far short of calling for direct U.S. investment, establishment of diplomatic relations or foreign aid.

<p>







The Cuban government estimates the negative effect of the blockade at more than 67 billion dollars.
