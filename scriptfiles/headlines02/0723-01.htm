<p>US military investigators are to travel to a village in Afghanistan later this 

week to try to explain why an American AC-130 gunship killed at least 48 civilians 

in a bombing raid on a wedding party. 

<P>About 117 Afghans were injured in the attack on villages near Kakrak in southern 

Afghanistan earlier this month. US military officials at first refused to apologize 

for the bombing raid, insisting their pilots were fired at from the ground. 

<P>The attack appeared to trigger the first opposition to the US military from 

within the Kabul regime and has opened a potentially damaging rift between the 

president, Hamid Karzai, who is a Pashtun, and the powerful Tajik foreign minister, 

Abdullah Abdullah. 

<P>US investigators have started questioning servicemen involved in the operation 

at a military base in Kandahar. The team will travel next to the targeted villages 

where they will work "for as long as it takes" to find out what happened on the 

night of the raid, Colonel Roger King, a US military spokesman, said yesterday. 

<P>"War is not a precise art," Col King said, admitting that US military planners 

frequently had to rely on incomplete intelligence from local Afghan commanders. 

<P>"You can have precision munitions and they may indeed strike exactly where 

you think they ought to strike from 30,000ft &#91;9,000 meters&#93;, but that 

may not be where you ought to strike when you're three feet away," he said. 

<P>"You may also have, from time to time, less than perfect intelligence upon 

which you're acting." 

<P>Shortly after the July 1 attack Mr Karzai summoned US military chiefs to insist 

that "all necessary measures" were taken to prevent civilian deaths in future. 

Now, however, he appears to have tempered his anger and has defended US military 

tactics. 

<P>But others in the government are still furious. At the weekend Dr Abdullah 

said for the first time that Afghan officials wanted a say in the conduct of future 

raids. 

<P>"We have to be given a larger role. If things do not improve, well, I will 

certainly pray for the Americans and wish them success but I will no longer be 

able to take part in this," the foreign minister told the New York Times. 

<P>Yesterday Mr Karzai's chief of staff appeared to be at odds with Dr Abdullah. 

He said the Kabul government continued its support for US military actions and 

dismissed concerns about the number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan. 

<P>"Considering the scope of the operations I think the number of casualties is 

not that extensive," said Tayeb Jawad. "The fact is that the Afghans and the Americans 

are fighting the same war against terrorism. This is a combat in which we share 

many common objectives." 

<P>After the powerful defense minister, Field Marshal Mohammad Fahim, Dr Abdullah 

is the most important figure from the Northern Alliance in the Kabul government. 

Diplomats and aid workers in Kabul fear a split between the Alliance and Mr Karzai 

could seriously disrupt hopes for a stable government. 

<P>Marshal Fahim's forces include 500 armored personnel carriers and 300 tanks, 

which would be enough to dislodge the international security assistance force 

(Isaf) providing security in Kabul. US troops have in the last two weeks been 

called in to help guard Mr Karzai. 

<P>The New York Times said it had reviewed 11 areas in Afghanistan bombed by US 

planes and found 400 civilians were killed. Global Exchange, an American organization 

studying the effects of the military campaign, has drawn up a list of 812 Afghan 

civilians killed in US air strikes. 

<P>At the heart of the problem appears to be an American reliance on often faulty 

intelligence. In the villages near Kakrak there were at least two engagement parties 

on the night of the bombing and guests fired their guns into the air in a traditional 

form of celebration. US special forces troops in the area reported seeing anti-aircraft 

fire, although Afghans denied targeting American planes. Among the dead were 25 

relatives of Abdul Malik, a local warlord who fought alongside Mr Karzai after 

September 11. 

<P>Aid workers have also questioned the heavy firepower used in such raids. The 

AC-130 gunship is often used for devastating saturation night-bombing.
