<p> Gerhard Schr&#246;der's Social Democrats opened talks with the Greens yesterday 

on the shape and program of their new coalition government. 

<P>The Greens, who played a crucial role in securing victory for the center-left 

at last Sunday's general election, went into the negotiations with a far stronger 

hand than four years ago when the 'red-green' experiment was launched after the 

ousting of Helmut Kohl. 

<P>It was unclear whether the Greens would get a fourth seat in the cabinet. There 

have been indications that they might prefer to secure more power and funding 

for the ministries they already control. 

<P>Joschka Fischer, the party's most experienced and charismatic figure, is certain 

to remain in the foreign ministry. 

<P>And no signs of imminent change have emerged at either the environment ministry, 

headed by J&#252;rgen Trittin, or the food, farming and consumer protection 'super-ministry', 

run by Renate K&#252;nast. 

<P>The first likely sticking point for the coalition may be military conscription. 

With a majority of just nine seats, the two parties must reach a clear understanding 

to forestall a backbench rebellion that could bring down the government. 

<P>The Greens want to start building a volunteer army. But the Social Democrat 

(SPD) defense minister, Peter Stuck, was reported yesterday to be insisting that 

the coalition pact include a commitment to retain conscription. 

<P>No official deadline has been set for the conclusion of negotiations, but both 

sides were aiming to finish before October 18, when the Greens begin a special 

delegate conference at which the rank and file membership could endorse the coalition 

pact. 

<P>In an interview with Stern magazine yesterday, the governor of Lower Saxony, 

Sigmar Gabriel, an influential figure in the SPD, said a central aim of the new 

government should be to get non-wage labor costs below 40%. The burden of employers' 

social security contributions holds down profits and deters bosses from hiring 

staff 

<P>Unemployment, running at almost 10%, was a central theme of the election, which 

Mr Schr&#246;der came within a whisker of losing. Mr Gabriel, who is close to 

the chancellor, said the result of the election was a "yellow card" for both the 

parties in government. 

<P><B>&#183;</B> The US defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, denied snubbing the 

German defense minister, Peter Stuck, by walking out before his speech at a Nato 

meeting on Tuesday. He also took a swipe at Berlin's efforts to mend the rift 

with the US over Mr Schr&#246;der's anti-war rhetoric, saying : "We do have a 

saying in America: if you're in a hole, stop digging." </p>
