<p> Weeds have become stronger and fitter by cross-breeding with genetically modified 

crops, leading to fears that superweeds which are difficult or impossible to control 

may invade farms growing standard crops. 

<P>Two separate teams, one working on sunflowers in the US and the other on sugar 

beet in France, have shown weeds and GM food crops readily swapping genes. 

<P>In the case of wild sunflowers, classed as "weed" varieties in America, specimens 

became hardier and produced 50% more seeds if they were crossed with GM sunflowers 

which had been programmed to be resistant to seed-nibbling moth larvae.

<P>Allison Snow, who headed the team at Ohio State University, confessed in New 

Scientist that she was "shocked" by the results. "It does not prove all GM crops 

are dangerous," she said. "I just think we need to be careful because genes can 

be very valuable for a weed and persist for ever once they are out there." 

<P>Pioneer Hi-Bred, which developed the GM sunflower, has abandoned the idea of 

selling the strain commercially. 

<P>The sugar beet results show that wild and GM varieties swapped genes, sometimes 

to the advantage of the wild varieties and the detriment of the GM plants, which 

produced lower yields. Writing in the Journal of Applied Ecology, the University 

of Lille team said they had underestimated the likelihood of GM beets swapping 

genes with the beet weeds that grow among them. 

<P>The two sets of results add to the fears of environmental groups and organic 

farmers that normal crops could be contaminated by GM varieties - and make weeds 

impossible to control. This is less of a problem in countries where crops have 

been introduced, for instance soya grown the US, because no native weed varieties 

exist. But in Europe, particularly in Britain, where weed species of both beet 

and oil seed rape exist, the risk is potentially serious. 

<P>Adrian Bebb, GM campaigner at the environmental group Friends of the Earth, 

said GM beet was now being grown at 16 farm-scale trial sites in England. "Once 

again scientists are discovering new impacts of GM crops," he said. "The government 

always emphasizes the importance of a sound scientific approach to GM crop safety, 

so they should look at this research seriously and question whether or not we 

should be testing GM crops out of doors." 

<P>Two years ago government research reported that GM crops could cross-pollinate 

with ordinary crops over larger distances than had been thought. The government 

is in its final year of trials to investigate the effect of growing GM crops on 

the countryside.</p>
