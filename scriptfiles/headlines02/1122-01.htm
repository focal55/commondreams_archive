<p>WASHINGTON - </b> Despite two years of unprecedented violence between Israelis 

and Palestinians, Arab and Jewish Americans generally agree on the outlines of 

a final settlement between the two peoples, according to an unprecedented poll 

released here Thursday. 

<p> The poll, carried out late last month by the <a href="http://www.aaiusa.org/" target="_new">Arab-American 

Institute</a> (AAI) and <a href="http://www.peacenow.org/" target="_new">Americans 

for Peace Now</a> (APN), found that both communities were critical of the Mideast 

policies of the administration of President George W. Bush and overwhelmingly 

support a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 

<p> It also found that majorities in both groups supported a final settlement 

based on the outlines agreed to by the last Labour government in Israel and the 

Palestinian National Authority (PNA) at Taba, Egypt in January 2001, just before 

the election of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 

<p> Of 500 people polled at random from each community, 52 percent of U.S. Jews 

and 79 percent of Arab Americans said they would support a settlement that led 

to two independent and secure states with a common border that would be defined 

roughly by Israel's 1967 frontiers, with a shared capital. 

<p> Less than one-third of Jewish respondents opposed such a solution, with 18 

percent expressing uncertainty or no opinion. Only 11 percent of Arab-American 

respondents said they would oppose such a resolution. 

<p> ''The AAI/APN joint survey reveals that our two communities are much more 

moderate on Middle East-related issues than people are often led to believe,'' 

said Debra DeLee, APN's president. 

<p> ''In fact, this study provides encouraging information about the potential 

for both communities to work together in pursuit of common interests in the region, 

(and) sends a message to decision-makers in Washington that Arab Americans and 

Jewish Americans at large want to the see the U.S. follow policies that will encourage 

the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, rather than distract from it,'' she said. 

<p> The survey results were released at a moment of tension and uncertainty in 

the Middle East, caused above all by speculation over whether the United States 

will go to war against Iraq. 

<p> But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has killed more than 2,000 people 

in the past two years, shows little sign of winding down: 11 Israelis were killed 

in a Palestinian suicide bombing aboard a bus in Jerusalem on Thursday, and senior 

Israeli officials vowed a response. 

<p> On the other hand, the resignation of the Labour Party from Sharon's government 

and its election this week of ret. Gen. Amram Mitzna, who wants to renew peace 

talks with the PNA, to lead the party into the January 28 elections have altered 

the political dynamics in Israel. 

<p> The developments could encourage U.S. Jews, like the Labour Party, to be more 

outspoken against the hawkish policies of Sharon's Likud Party. 

<p> Significantly, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser and close confidant 

of former President George H.W. Bush who played a key role in persuading Bush 

junior to go to the U.N. Security Council before striking Iraq, urged the president 

in a column published in the Washington Post on Thursday to take advantage of 

Labour's decision to put the peace process at the top of the election agenda. 

<p> Launching a new diplomatic initiative on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 

would bolster Arab support for Washington in its confrontation with Iraq, said 

Scowcroft. 

<p> He called in particular for Washington to both spell out ''the road map'' 

it has worked out with the United Nations, the European Union (EU), and Russia, 

for achieving a Palestinian state by 2005 and to press Israel to stop all settlement 

expansion and pull back its forces from population centers in the West Bank. 

<p> ''The administration owes the parties a clear statement of its vision," Scowcroft 

wrote. ''Presenting it at this time could provide both the Israeli and Palestinian 

publics a broader perspective on the most important issue facing them even as 

they engage in the election process.'' 

<p> Judging by the AAI-APN survey results, Bush would also gain much support for 

such an effort from the Arab- and Jewish-American communities, which number some 

three million and 5.2 million people, respectively. 

<p> ''If politicians are looking for a constituency for peace,'' said AAI president 

James Zogby, ''they'll find it in these two communities.'' 

<p> Both Zogby and DeLee said they were surprised by the extent of agreement between 

the two communities after two years of often-horrific violence between Israelis 

and Palestinians. 

<p> ''If we'd done this survey in 2000, we might have expected these results,'' 

said Zogby. ''But, after two years of terrible violence, the fact that we could 

get this degree of a commitment to a common future is really quite heartening.'' 

<p> Two-thirds of respondents in both communities rated the administration's performance 

either ''poor'' or ''fair'' in dealing with the Middle East, as opposed to ''excellent'' 

or ''good''. 

<p> Nearly two-thirds of Arab-Americans and 45 percent of Jewish Americans said 

the administration should try to ''steer a middle course'' between the Palestinians 

and Israelis in its pursuit of peace. But 65 percent of Arab-Americans and nearly 

40 percent of U.S. Jews said the administration favors Israel. 

<p> Asked whether they agreed or disagreed that Palestinians have a right to live 

in a ''secure and independent state of their own'', 85.5 percent of Jews agreed, 

as did 95.6 of Arab-Americans. Posed the same choice about the right of Israelis 

to an independent and secure state, 96.6 percent of Jews agreed, as did 95.4 percent 

of Arab-Americans. 

<p> Asked who was responsible for the breakdown in the peace process, 42.1 percent 

of Jewish-Americans and 49.6 percent of Arab-Americans blamed both sides, a particularly 

significant result given that respondents were given seven possible choices. 

<p> The survey found a high level of support for the Taba framework, whose main 

elements include a two-state solution, the evacuation of most Jewish settlements 

from the occupied territories, the establishment of a border roughly along the 

pre-1967 frontiers, a Palestinian right of return only inside a new Palestinian 

state, and a shared capital in Jerusalem. 

<p> Only 30 percent of Jewish-Americans and 11 percent of Arab-Americans opposed 

such a solution. 

<p> The study also found that, despite areas of agreement, both communities harbored 

misconceptions about the attitudes of each other. Thirty percent of Arab Americans 

thought that less than half of the Jewish community supported a secure and independent 

Palestinian state, while the actual level of support was 85.5 percent. 

<p> Similarly, 41 percent of Jewish Americans thought that less than half of Arab 

Americans supported a secure and independent Israel, when the actual percentage 

was 95.4 percent. Despite those differences, 94 percent of Arab Americans and 

87 percent of Jewish Americans agreed that it was either ''very'' or ''somewhat'' 

important for the two communities to work together. 

<p> ''Both communities don't know each other to the degree that they should,'' 

said Zogby, who noted that Jewish-Arab dialogue groups have been proliferating 

at the grass-roots level in the past year ''in part because the situation (in 

the Middle East) feels like it's spinning out of control''.
