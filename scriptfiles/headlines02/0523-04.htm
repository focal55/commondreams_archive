<p>WASHINGTON, May 22 &#0151; Congressional negotiators failed today to overcome sharp differences about an abortion-rights provision that is threatening to scuttle a bill overhauling the nation's bankruptcy system.</p>

<P> The bill, which would crack down on debtors, enjoys wide support on Capitol Hill.</p>

At what was promoted as a pivotal meeting on the fate of the five-year-old bill, members of a House-Senate conference committee engaged in an often emotional debate over whether it should include language to stop protesters who block access to abortion clinics from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court-ordered fines or civil judgments owed to the clinics.

<P> Democrats led by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and other abortion-rights supporters said any compromise bankruptcy bill must prevent the practice, while anti-abortion House Republicans led by Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois said Senator Schumer's provision would limit the rights of peaceful anti-abortion protesters.</p>

<P> The hearing, which ended with an agreement to continue the negotiations, was a reminder of how abortion rights can overwhelm any other set of issues in American politics and how the debate polarizes lawmakers who might otherwise agree.</p>

<P> At one point in the hearing, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the normally even-tempered Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, angrily reminded his colleagues that he had been designated as a target for violent attacks, even assassination, on a Web site run by abortion opponents who later declared bankruptcy to avoid paying court judgments. The Web site was known as the Nuremberg Files.</p>

<P> "I don't take the Nuremberg Files lightly, and I don't take this issue lightly," Mr. Leahy said. "This is not sticks-and-stones. This loophole has to be closed." </p>

<P> Almost lost in the debate today was the potential impact of the overall bill, which would limit the ability of millions of Americans to erase their credit card bills and other debts when they declare bankruptcy. </p>

<P> The bill has been championed by lobbyists for banks, credit card companies and retailers who have sharply increased their campaign contributions to members of Congress in recent years. The bill has been widely criticized by consumers' groups and professors who specialize in bankruptcy law.</p>

<P> Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and is leading the conference committee, said he was frustrated that the bill's approval was being blocked by the abortion provision, which he described as "mostly an extraneous issue that purports to deal with a problem that, in large measure, does not exist."</p>

<P> But Senator Schumer said that in several recent cases, abortion opponents had turned to bankruptcy courts to erase the debts they owe as a result of protests intended to shut down abortion clinics.</p>

<P> Mr. Schumer cited documents and Internet sites on which anti-abortion groups outlined their plans to use bankruptcy filings to erase their debts. "This is the method these extremists have chosen," he said. </p>

<P> Representative Hyde said current law already accomplished the central goal of blocking violent anti-abortion protesters and others who break the law in abortion protests from escaping their debts in bankruptcy. </p>

<P> Mr. Hyde said he was concerned that Senator Schumer's provision might be used to punish nonviolent protesters, offering the example of an "85-year-old nun who is standing in front of an abortion clinic saying the rosary who crosses a police line she doesn't see." Looking across the table at Senator Schumer, he said, "You sensitive civil libertarians should feel just as strongly as I do about this."</p>

<P> Senator Schumer said that his provision was written to ensure that peaceful protesters were not punished &#0151; "certainly not an 85-year-old nun who inadvertently crosses a line" &#0151; and that he was prepared to continue to negotiate with Mr. Hyde on a compromise. But he said he was not willing to compromise on "rock-bottom principles that are not pro-life or pro-choice."</p>
