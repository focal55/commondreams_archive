<p>WASHINGTON -- A Baghdad mob burnt President George W. Bush in effigy yesterday, 

hours after U.S. warplanes bombed Iraqi air-defense sites, as the two sides traded 

insults and accusations that undermined hopes for a resumption of weapons inspections 

that might avert war.</P>

<P>The White House poured scorn on a Baghdad invitation to congressmen and U.S. 

experts to tour suspected biological-, chemical- and nuclear-weapons sites in 

Iraq. In turn, an Iraqi legislator who appeared at a state-organized demonstration 

denounced Mr. Bush as &#34;a danger to human civilization because he is the No. 

1 terrorist in the world.&#34;</P>

<P>Salim Qubiesi, a member of Iraq's powerless parliament, told a chanting crowd 

of about 10,000 in Baghdad that the world should get rid of the U.S. President, 

not Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</P>

<P>Washington was equally blunt. Senior officials dismissed as a &#34;stunt&#34; 

Baghdad's offer to let U.S. politicians tour suspected weapons sites.</P>

<P>Amid the bluster of rhetorical salvos, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi 

Annan gave a careful reply to Baghdad's vague offer to hold talks about renewed 

UN inspections of alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.</P>

<P>&#34;We would want to discuss with them the return of the inspectors,&#34; 

Mr. Annan said after lunching with ambassadors of the 15-member Security Council 

in New York. &#34;If Iraq is open to that idea, there are practical means to send 

the inspectors back.&#34;</P>

<P>However, it is clear that Baghdad's offer of talks about the possibility of 

renewed inspections isn't sufficient to satisfy Washington. &#34;Nothing's changed,&#34; 

was Mr. Bush's dismissive response to last week's letter to the UN from Iraqi 

Foreign Minister Naji Sabri.</P>

<P>There seems little likelihood of a diplomatic breakthrough. Washington is steadfast 

that Iraq must allow unobstructed, inspections any time, any where and must comply 

fully with UN resolutions on destruction of all its weapons of mass destruction.</P>

<P>&#34;There's no discussion required,&#34; said State Department spokesman Philip 

Reeker yesterday. &#34;This is not about obfuscating or trying to change the subject 

or move the goal posts. It's about disarmament, and that's where we'll continue 

to keep the focus.&#34;</P>

<P>Even if Baghdad were to capitulate and allow full, unfettered weapons inspections, 

the Bush administration has said it still wants &#34;regime change&#34; in Iraq, 

despite the misgivings of many and the outright opposition of some of Washington's 

closest allies.</P>

<P>Mr. Bush is committed to ousting Mr. Hussein. Although the U.S. President insists 

Washington is not committed to war and will try economic, political and diplomatic 

leverage, his administration's uncompromising insistence that the Iraqi leader 

must go leaves little room for peaceful maneuvering.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, U.S. and British warplanes pounded an Iraqi air-defense command 

bunker yesterday. It was the 25th time this year that allied strike aircraft have 

bombed or fired missiles at Iraqi targets.</P>

<P>The Pentagon says that on at least 70 occasions this year, Iraq has fired surface-to-air 

missiles or anti-aircraft artillery at British and U.S. warplanes patrolling the 

no-fly zones, which cover about two-thirds of Iraq.</P>

<P>Baghdad regards the zones as illegal and arbitrarily imposed by the United 

States.</P>
