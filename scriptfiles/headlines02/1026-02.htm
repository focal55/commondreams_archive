<p>NEW DELHI  - By the year 2080, Manhattan

and Shanghai could be underwater, droughts and floods could

become more extreme and hundreds of millions of people will be

at risk from disease, starvation and water shortages.<P> That is the picture that a Greenpeace senior official

painted of the future if the world failed to take urgent steps

to curb greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming.<P> &quot;We're talking of about the submergence of islands,

submergence of Shanghai, the submergence of Bombay, the

submergence of New York City,&quot; Greenpeace climate policy

director Steve Sawyer told Reuters late on Friday.<P> &quot;Manhattan would be under water.&quot;<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

of the building where U.N. delegates from 185 countries work to implement a global 

warming accord at the U.N. Climate Change talks in New Delhi, India Friday, Oct. 

25, 2002. The ten-day meeting, began Wednesday, aims to chalk out measures for 

governments and civilians before the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on climate changes takes 

effect early next year. (AP Photo/Elizabeth Dalziel) <br>

</table></font></font>Sawyer, who is in New Delhi for a 10-day annual U.N.

climate change conference, said global warming would lead to

the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which in turn would

cause a five to seven metre (16 to 23 ft) sea-level rise and

the inundation of coastal regions.<P> &quot;Most coastal cities would be uninhabitable in their

present forms...and that's a catastrophic change of the shape

of continents.&quot;<P> Some environmentalists have said that recent climate

disasters around the world -- from droughts in India, Australia

and the United States to floods in Europe -- have been graphic

harbingers of some of the expected consequences of global

warming.<P> The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has

predicted that by 2100 global average surface temperature will

be 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius higher than it was in 1990.<P> Sawyer said an increase in temperatures would lead to more

extreme droughts and a rise in frequency and intensity of

tropical cyclones.<P> &quot;What these temperature changes are going to do to the

hydrological cycle, particularly in the tropics, is not a very

pretty picture,&quot; he said.<P> Between 2050 and 2080, tens of millions of people would be

more at risk of malaria, coastal flooding and starvation and

hundreds of millions of people would be at risk from water

shortages, he said.<P> Delegates from 185 countries are attending the climate

conference, which is likely to be the last major climate

meeting before the 1997 Kyoto Protocol is expected to come into

force early next year.<P> The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

from the developed world by 2012 to 5.2 percent below 1990

levels.<P> But the United States, the world's biggest air polluter,

has refused to ratify the treaty, which it sees as flawed

because it does not bind developing countries. It also says it

would hurt the U.S. economy.<P> The Earth Summit in Johannesburg earlier this year was

widely criticised by environmentalists and vulnerable Pacific

nations for barely touching on the problem of global warming.

The United States was singled out for criticism.</p>
