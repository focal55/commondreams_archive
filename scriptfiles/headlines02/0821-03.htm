<p> CHICOUTIMI, Quebec - The Canadian government said on Tuesday it would not 

engage in U.S.-led military action against Baghdad unless it had stronger evidence 

of imminent Iraqi aggression.

<p>Defense Minister John McCallum said the Canadian government  did not have clear evidence that military action should be  undertaken.<p>"Based on the information that we have now, everyone in  this government has been saying it is unlikely that we would  join an attack against Iraq," he told Reuters at a meeting of  the governing Liberal Party in Chicoutimi, Quebec.<p>Foreign Minister Bill Graham told Reuters separately that  the government was not looking at taking part in military  action now.<p>"If there was a clear danger that Iraq was going to attack  its neighbors, that it has the capacity to use weapons of mass  destruction and was about to use it, clearly we would  reevaluate our policy," Graham said.<p>"We have not been asked to take part in military action and  we are certainly not contemplating that."<p>The minister said that it was important to work through the  United Nations and to be "aggressive" in pursuing Iraq for  weapons of mass destruction.<p>"We are telling Iraq 'you better allow inspectors in,  because it is in your interest if you wish to avoid a  conflict'," Graham said.

<p>After Iraq was expelled from Kuwait in 1991, the United Nations instituted 

inspections to look for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, but Iraq has 

barred the inspectors from returning since they left in 1998.
