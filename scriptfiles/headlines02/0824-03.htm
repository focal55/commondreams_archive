<p>Six Greenpeace activists landed at a jetty at South Africa's only nuclear reactor and climbed onto the roof of the plant to protest over nuclear power in the country, a spokeswoman said.</p>

</table></font>The activists -- two from the Netherlands, one Australian, one Lebanese, one Mexican and one Argentinian -- unfurled two huge yellow banners, saying: "Nukes out of Africa."</p>

<p>Greenpeace spokeswoman Sarah Holden told AFP Saturday the activists arrived by inflatable boat at around 7:30 am (0530 GMT) at the Koeberg nuclear plant, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Cape Town.</p>

<p>"They are still on the roof and will stay there as long as they can and it is safe to do so," Holden said from outside the reactor.</p>

<p>Holden said Koeberg was the only nuclear power plant in the country, and Greenpeace wanted it to be the last.</p>

<p>The activists wanted to draw the public's attention to the dangers of nuclear 

power -- which she described as "madness" -- and to discourage the expansion of 

South Africa's nuclear energy program, she added.</p>

<p>Nuclear power and fossil fuel in Africa formed a major part of Greenpeace's agenda for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg which starts Monday.</p>

<p>"We call on the South African government, who is hosting this conference, to be the leader in the renewable energy revolution," Greenpeace spokesman Mike Townsley told AFP.</p>

<p>He said police have arrived at the reactor in vans and armored cars, while 

a police helicopter was buzzing two inflatables in the bay close to the reactor.</p>

<p>Police declined to comment when contacted by AFP.</p>
