The administration of President George W. Bush   is actively considering "unsigning" the 1998 Rome Protocol establishing an International Criminal Court (ICC) before it takes effect next week when the 60th signatory to the treaty is expected to deposit its ratification with the United Nations, according to knowledgeable sources.

<p>

An "unsigning," which was first hinted at by a senior State Department official 10 days ago, would be designed to show strong U.S. opposition to the new court whose task it will be to prosecute and try cases involving war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and international terrorism.

<p>







At the same time, the administration in recent days has moved to reassure its European allies that it will not try to pressure any of the anticipated signatories into changing their minds or to actively pursue a campaign to undermine the court, a course which has been urged on the administration by far-right sectors in the U.S. Congress.

<p>







"If the administration goes ahead with the 'unsigning' it will be mostly symbolic," said one State Department official, who opposes the move and asked not to be identified.

<p>







The move against the treaty, which was signed by Bill Clinton as one of his last acts as president, is unprecedented and is almost certain to provoke protests from Washington's European allies, all of which have ratified the treaty.

<p>







"Unsigning this treaty is an unnecessary, unilateralist act that would undermine the war against terrorism," said Heather Hamilton, director of programs at the World Federalist Association (WFA), part of a coalition of groups which back the treaty, called 'USA for ICC.'

<p>







"The administration has a critical decision to make: either it can pander to the right wing in an election year, or it can maintain the international coalition it has worked so hard to build for American national security," said Hamilton.

<p>







Rightwingers in Congress strongly oppose the treaty due to fears that it compromises U.S. constitutional guarantees, U.S. sovereignty, and could be used to pursue politically motivated prosecutions of U.S. troops stationed overseas.

<p>







They have rallied behind a pending bill in Congress, the American Servicemen's Protection Act (ASPA), which not only bars any U.S. cooperation with the court, but also bars U.S. military aid to other countries unless they agree to shield U.S. troops on their territory from ICC prosecution. It also bans U.S. troops from taking part in UN peacekeeping operations unless the UN Security Council explicitly exempts them from possible prosecution.

<p>







One version of the bill, which is still being discussed in Congress, would open the way for the president to use force to free U.S. prisoners hauled before the ICC, which is to be located at The Hague, in the Netherlands.

<p>







The administration endorsed ASPA last Fall on the condition that the president is given the authority to waive any of its provisions if he determines it is in the national interest to do so.

<p>







The State Department has reportedly opposed any "unsigning" of the treaty, fearing that even such a symbolic move will further strain relations with European allies which have voiced increasing concern over the administration's unilateral direction on a number of international issues.

<p>







But both Vice-President Dick Cheney  and defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld are reported to strongly favor "unsigning" the treaty.

<p>







Fifty-six countries of the 139 which have signed the treaty since 1998 have deposited their ratifications with the UN. The UN has scheduled a ceremony for April 11 at which as many as eight countries--including Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Greece, Jordan, Latvia, Niger, and Romania--are expected to add their signatures to the list, bringing the total to more than 60, the number required for the treaty to take effect.

<p>







The court's operations will then begin July 1 for crimes committed after that date. Past crimes will remain restricted to national courts or the special UN tribunals that have been set up over the past decade for Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
