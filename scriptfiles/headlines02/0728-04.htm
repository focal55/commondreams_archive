<p>BAGHDAD - Iraq said on Sunday it had taken all measures to face a possible 

U.S. military strike to topple President Saddam Hussein.

<p>"Our leadership has prepared everything and our people are  determined to resist all attempts against our country," said  the speaker of parliament, Saadoun Hammadi.<p>"Our people's morale is high, our financial potential is  good and we are quite certain we will be able to thwart the  U.S. aggression," he told reporters after parliament met to  discuss preparations for a U.S. military attack.<p>President Bush said this month Washington would use all  tools at its disposal to topple Saddam. He has branded Iraq  part of an "axis of evil" supporting terrorism and developing  weapons of mass destruction.<p>Iraq has repeatedly denied the U.S. charges.<p>Baghdad also renewed a challenge to British Prime Minister  Tony Blair on Sunday to produce evidence his government claims  to possess about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction.<p>Saddam said this month that the United States and its  allies would not be able to topple his government and Iraq's  parliament has voted to back military preparations to repel any  attack.<p>"We shall defend our country in our territory," Iraqi  Foreign Minister Naji Sabri told CNN on Saturday.<p>WEAPONS INSPECTIONS<p>He said Washington wanted U.N. weapons inspectors to return  to Iraq "for the sole purpose of updating their military and  intelligence information on Iraq to be used in any attack on  the Iraqi population."<p>Iraq would only allow the return of inspectors if it was  based on what he called a U.N. agenda, not a U.S. one, he said.<p>Resuming weapons inspections is key to suspending U.N.  sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. It could  also ward off a U.S. attack on Iraq.<p>After three rounds of talks with Sabri, U.N. Secretary  General Kofi Annan told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday  that until Baghdad indicated it was prepared to allow  inspectors back in there would be no further talks at his  level.<p>Arms experts have been barred from Iraq since December 1998  when the United States and Britain launched a bombing campaign  to punish Baghdad's alleged failure to cooperate with them.<p>An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman repeated on Sunday an  offer Iraq made last February to let in a team of British arms  inspectors if Britain could say where any Iraqi weapons of mass  destruction were being produced.<p>"Blair is determined to avoid replying to an offer made by  Iraq on February 28 to immediately receive a British mission  sent by Blair himself to show how and where Iraq is attempting  to produce such weapons," the Iraqi spokesman said.<p>"If the British prime minister wants to prove his claims,  the offer still stands and we challenge him once again to  produce any evidence," the spokesman added.<p>Blair said on Thursday that "Saddam is in breach of all the  United Nations resolutions. Weapons of mass destruction is an  issue but we have taken no decisions as how to deal with it."</span>
