<p>America has infuriated its allies at the United Nations by threatening to keep 

US troops out of peacekeeping forces unless they are granted a blanket immunity 

from prosecution by the International Criminal Court, which comes into being next 

month. 

<P>Richard Williamson, a US representative at the UN, said he had warned the security 

council that "there should be no misunderstanding. If there is not adequate protection 

for US peacekeepers, there will be no US peacekeepers." 

<P>Human rights campaigners accused the US of a "shortsighted and ultimately pathetic" 

scare campaign. 

<P>Mr Williamson's comments reflect long-standing US opposition to the court, 

which opens its doors on July 1. 

<P>The treaty to establish it was ratified by more than 60 countries. But America 

failed to sign up, saying it was not bound by former president Bill Clinton's 

support for the court. The decision was interpreted by critics of the Bush administration 

as a concession to conservative Republicans who fear US citizens could become 

the victims of politically motivated war crimes trials. 

<P>The court, strongly supported by the British government, will have the power 

to prosecute political leaders or military officers thought to have committed 

war crimes or crimes against humanity. 

<P>Diplomats at the UN dismissed the idea that the security council would agree 

to a US proposal, made yesterday morning, for a resolution placing all peacekeepers 

outside the court's reach. 

<P>"That will not get support," a western diplomat said. "The US ideal is almost 

certainly more than the others can accept. Members of the council, even where 

they haven't yet ratified the court, are supporters, and don't want to do anything 

that would completely damage the court and the spirit of the court." 

<P>Another diplomat said: "Even close friends are very, very nervous. This is 

really a serious assault on the international legal order." 

<P>"This is a scare campaign, driven by a unilateralist animosity towards international 

institutions, and the rule of law in particular," said Richard Dicker, a legal 

expert with Human Rights Watch. 

<P>"Those in this administration who are the most virulently opposed to extending 

the rule of law are dictating a shortsighted and ultimately pathetic policy." 

<P>Coming soon after reports that the US is planning a new military approach of 

pre-emptive strikes against suspected enemies, the move highlights the objection 

some in the Bush administration have to a single worldwide approach to the laws 

of war. 

<P>The framework of the court allows for signatories to reach individual agreements 

with the US that its citizens will not be subject to the court's rule. Supporters 

of the court argue that this ought to be enough to protect US troops. 

<P>But a US official said yesterday that those agreements were insufficient. "They 

don't go far enough, they take a long time, and we don't think that's the best 

approach," the official said. "This resolution is the best way. We're not trying 

to undercut the court, we're trying to make sure that peacekeeping will be workable 

in the future and that peacekeepers will not have to worry about having politicized 

charges brought against them."</p>
