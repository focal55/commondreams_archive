<p>BAGHDAD  - If a U.S.-led war with Iraq smears

blood on his hands as an American citizen, Sean Penn  wants to

know why -- and he has come to Baghdad to find out.

</table></font>"Absolutely I think war can be avoided, but obviously it's

going to take enormous commitment on the part of the Iraqi

government as well as the United States," the actor-director

told Reuters television in an interview on Sunday.

 <p>

 "I will certainly do what I can to support that commitment

to looking for other options," Penn said.

 

<p>

 The former Hollywood bad boy and Oscar nominee paid for a

&#36;56,000 advertisement in the Washington Post in October

accusing President Bush  of stifling debate on Iraq.

 <p>

 He declined to renew his criticism of Bush on foreign soil,

saying he would reserve political comments for his return home.

 

<p>

 Bush has threatened war to topple President Saddam Hussein 

if he fails to abandon his alleged doomsday arsenal.

 <p>

 Penn said it would "suit us all" if Iraq fully disclosed

any banned weapons it still has, but questioned whether U.S.

national security concerns about this justified war.

 <p>

 Asked if his three-day trip to Baghdad might expose him to

charges of lack of patriotism, Penn said he would be happy to

debate anyone who made such accusations.

 <p>

 "I'm here for a simple reason, which is because I'm a

patriot and an American who has benefited enormously from being

an American, and because I had areas of personal concern and

conscience that led me to come to Iraq.

 <p>

 "I believe, however I vote and whatever my perspective,

that I do deserve the government I get," he said.

 <p>

 "And if there's going to be blood on my hands, I'm

determined that it's not going to be invisible. That blood is

not just Iraqi blood, it's the blood of American soldiers."

<p>

SMILING IN ADVERSITY

<p>

Penn's visit was organized by the <a href="http://www.accuracy.org" target="_new">Institute of Public

Accuracy</a>, a U.S. group of policy analysts.

<p>

He has toured a Baghdad children's hospital, wandered the

streets without an Iraqi minder and had meetings with Deputy

Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and Health Minister Umeed Madhat

Mubarak -- who gave him a hard time for his smoking habit.

<p>

Penn said he had been touched by the warmth of ordinary

Iraqis despite the tension and suffering of their daily lives.

<p>

"I do find it very moving, you know, the strength of a

smile in those circumstances, and the smiles that I saw were

abundant," he said.

<p>

Penn's advertisement in the Washington Post took the form

of an open letter in which he urged Bush to stop a cycle where

"bombing is answered by bombing, mutilation by mutilation,

killing by killing."

<p>

"Sacrificing American soldiers or innocent civilians in an

unprecedented pre-emptive attack on a separate sovereign nation

may well prove itself a most temporary medicine," he said.

<p>

More than 100 other American celebrities, including

Hollywood stars Kim Basinger, David Duchovny  and Mia Farrow,

signed an open letter last week which said rigorous United

Nations inspections were the best way to disarm Iraq, not war.

<p>

"HEIGHTENED DESPERATION"

<p>

Asked to explain his interest in Iraq, Penn said it was the

"current headline" for the Bush administration's war on terror.

<p>

"It's a war that is going to affect the generation of my

children," he said.

<p>

"Because of the technology and the heightened desperation

of the world today, I think it's very possible that we are

facing the first century that will complete itself without

mankind -- and that's not the future that I want for my

children, or for their children," he declared.

<p>

Penn said his Iraq odyssey, by helping him to be aware of

the times he lived in, could play into his professional life.

<p>

"Whatever story you have to tell, you have to be aware of

who you are telling it to and what the benefit of it is,

whether it's limited to amusement or a political statement,

because short of that it's simply what someone does alone in a

bathroom," the 42-year-old Californian said.

<p>

Did he hope to bridge the gap between American perceptions

of Iraq and the reality?

<p>

"I have to start with bridging my own gap," he replied.

<p>

"Ultimately if I can do that in the way you expressed, that

would be something I'd be very proud of."
