<p>WASHINGTON --

The Senate abruptly scaled back plans to boost global AIDS relief this 

year after the White House urged key Republicans to withdraw their support.

<P>The unanticipated development came just as Congress appeared on the verge 

of spending historic amounts to fight the deadly pandemic, which has infected 

4.5 million children and kills 5,000 people each day in Africa alone.

Hours before a vote Thursday on a $500 million AIDS proposal, White 

House budget director Mitch Daniels persuaded the measure's author, Republican 

Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, to reduce it by 60 percent.

<P>White House aides said President Bush would make his own announcement over 

the next few weeks to establish his commitment to the issue, but supporters of 

AIDS relief expressed doubts it would approach the level abandoned by the 

Senate Republicans.

<P>"Do we have any faith that the White House will make up for it? No," said 

Paul Zeitz, executive director of Global AIDS Alliance.

<P>Bush has proposed steady increases in AIDS funds, but his requests have not 

kept pace with the appetite of many lawmakers, including those from his own 

party. Support for fighting the disease reached critical mass this year on 

Capitol Hill, where, after years of more modest allocations, an unusual 

alliance of Republicans and Democrats made dramatic spending increases appear 

likely.

<P>More than 36 million people in the world today have HIV, the virus that 

causes AIDS, and 95 percent of those live in developing countries, according 

to a United Nations report. AIDS already has surpassed the plague, which 

ravaged medieval Europe, as the world's No. 1 killer.

<P><b>SOME RECENT UNLIKELY ALLIES</b>

<P>Jolted particularly by the number of mother-to-child transmissions in 

Africa, longtime opponents of AIDS relief have joined the crusade. One former 

opponent, Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, noted that at age 81, 

he is "mindful of soon meeting" his maker and confessed recently that he was 

"ashamed that I had not done more."

<P>Helms and Frist, a close ally of Bush, joined forces to propose a half-

billion-dollar addition to the emergency terror bill now before Congress to 

supplement the $750 million already being spent on international AIDS this 

year.

<P>But Thursday afternoon, after several conversations with Daniels, Frist 

stunned his colleagues by announcing that he no longer supported his own $500 

million proposal and planned to scale it back to $200 million.

<P>Democratic efforts to push the measure without the support of Frist and 

Helms, who is recuperating in the hospital from heart surgery but went along 

with his Republican colleague, failed by a 49-46 vote. Eight Democrats joined 

41 Republicans voting against it.

<P>"It's a bait and switch," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who like many 

of her colleagues assumed the Senate would approve at least $500 million in 

relief and perhaps as much as $700 million.

<P>Had she known that Frist, the only physician in the Senate, and Helms would 

pull their support at the 11th hour, "I would have organized my colleagues. I 

would have done something," Boxer said.

<P>The $200 million in AIDS spending approved by the Senate was part of a $31.

5 billion emergency bill directed mostly at providing money as soon as 

possible to combat terrorism. The Republicans' decision came amid a veto 

threat by Bush, who said the price tag on the terror bill was too steep. The 

spending bill isn't confined to terrorism measures, however, and includes $2 

million to store animal specimens at the Smithsonian and $2.5 million to map 

the Hawaiian coral reef.

<P>Aides to Frist and Helms said they agreed to drop their support of the more 

costly AIDS measure only after being assured by the White House that Bush 

would unveil a "comparable" plan to combat international AIDS, perhaps as 

early as next week.

<P>"We're going to end up at the same place by taking another route," said 

Frist spokeswoman Margaret Camp.

<P>"We feel very good about it. It's vastly better to have the president's 

support," said Helms' spokesman, Lester Munson.

<P><b>$100 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS

</b>

<P>Several sources on Capitol Hill and among AIDS activists said the Bush plan 

would include $100 million a year in additional AIDS funds for each of five 

years starting in 2004, which would fall far short of the Helms-Frist plan.

<P>White House spokesman Ken Lisaius said Helms and Frist are "working closely 

with the president" on the White House proposal, but he did not divulge any 

details or dollar amounts.

<P>The change drew charges of betrayal from advocates who said they have no 

reason to believe the White House will follow through on its commitment.

<P>"In no way do I believe that there is a deal or agreement I can accept," 

said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, one of Washington's most vocal advocates for 

increased spending to fight AIDS. "This was a real jolt. As we address the 

challenges of 9/11, we must not forget there are other challenges that affect 

the lives of millions of people."

<P>Boxer said, "We had an opportunity to be a real world leader on this, and 

we blew it."</p>
