<p>WASHINGTON &#150;&#150;  While the Clinton administration was pressuring Colombia to stop human rights abuses, Rep. Dennis Hastert was telling the country's police and military leaders that rights concerns were overblown, a newly declassified government document says.<P>In a May 1997 visit to Colombia before becoming House speaker, Hastert "decried 'leftist-dominated'" U.S. Congresses of years past that "used human rights as an excuse to aid the left in other countries," according to a cable signed by then-Ambassador Myles Frechette.<P>Hastert "vowed that he was committed to correcting that situation," it said.<P>Hastert also encouraged Colombian military and police to bypass the White House and deal directly with Congress, the cable said.<P>John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman, said the speaker strongly supports human rights efforts in Colombia and that the language in the cable likely reflected that Hastert "did not have a particularly strong relationship" with Frechette.<P>The Frechette cable was among 70 documents obtained by the National Security Archive, an independent foreign policy research center. It was posting the documents on its Web site Friday.<P>The release comes as the Bush administration is trying to persuade Congress to lift restrictions that generally limit Colombia's use of military aid to counternarcotics missions. It wants to allow Colombia to use U.S.-funded helicopters and other equipment to fight leftist guerrillas.<P>Documents going back as far as 1989 deal with some of the same issues being debated today. Among them are questions about how deeply the guerrillas are involved in drug trafficking.<P>A 1992 CIA memo says that "Andean government assertions that increased attacks against the insurgents wold affect the drug trade are primarily an attempt to convince the U.S. to allow the use of counternarcotics aid for counterinsurgency purposes."<P>Other documents show that in 2000, U.S. officials feared that Colombian soldiers from a U.S.-trained counternarcotics battalion were interacting with soldiers from Colombia's 24th Brigade, which has been linked to right-wing paramilitaries.<P>Colombia's paramilitaries are blamed for most of the country's massacres and are considered terrorists by the United States. The military's historical link to paramilitaries is a major reason some U.S. lawmakers are reluctant to expand U.S. aid. Officials from the Bush and Clinton administration have repeatedly stressed the need for progress in human rights as a condition for continued support.<P>In his 1997 visit, Hastert, R-Ill., led a delegation from the government reform national security subcommittee he chaired.<P>The Frechette cable quoted Hastert as telling Colombian military and police officials that he and other lawmakers were "sick and tired of people who spend most of their lives living outside the U.S. inhibiting the process by placing conditions on military aid when the lives of U.S. children and youth are being destroyed by drugs."<P>Hastert said police and military "already knew they could bypass the U.S. executive branch and communicate directly with the Congress; he encouraged them to continue to do so," the cable said.<P>In another cable two months later, Frechette said the Hastert visit was partly responsible for difficulties he was having in reaching an agreement with Colombia to assure that newly arriving military aid would be subjected to human rights conditions.<P>Feehery said the cables "have to be taken with a grain of salt" because of Hastert's differences with Frechette. About bypassing the executive branch, Feehery noted that Hastert worked closely with President Clinton in developing the $1.3 billion Plan Colombia aid package in 2000.<P>Frechette, now retired from the foreign service, said in an interview that the cable "was not intended to point fingers at Hastert." He said he was trying to provide an honest account of the visit to the State Department.<P>He said it was "ridiculous and absurd" to suggest that his relationship with Hastert colored the language. He said, though, that Hastert frequently criticized him because he didn't like the Clinton administration's policies toward Colombia.<P>"Hastert didn't like the policy, so he attacked me. I liked Hastert just fine," Frechette said.<P>&#150;&#150;&#150;
