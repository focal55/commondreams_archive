<p>WASHINGTON- Public opinion across the Arab world is deeply ambivalent about 

the United States, which is widely admired for its technological prowess and political 

institutions but disdained and even hatred for its policies toward Palestinians 

and Israel, says an unprecedented survey released here Tuesday. 

<p>The survey, whose results directly contradict declarations by top U.S. officials 

that Arab opposition to Washington derives from hatred of western ideals of democracy 

and freedom rather than U.S. policies, found that other western countries, particularly 

France and Canada, were widely respected throughout the Arab world. 

<p> ''They like our values but are angry at our policies,'' said James Zogby, 

president of the Arab American Institute (AAI), an influential, Washington-based 

lobby and public-education group. 

<p> The survey was based on face-to-face interviews last April and May of 3,800 

adult Arabs in eight countries: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, 

Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Each respondent was asked 92 

questions covering their personal values, political attitudes and priorities, 

and views of other countries. 

<p> It was funded by the Beirut-based Arab Thought Foundation and carried out 

by Washington-based Zogby International. 

<p> The unprecedented survey was undertaken in part to better define who Arabs 

are, particularly in the aftermath of last year's Sep. 11 terrorist attacks against 

New York and Washington, when U.S. public opinion became fixated on the question, 

''Why do they hate us?'' 

<p> The administration of President George W. Bush and its supporters in the Christian 

Right and the mainly Jewish neo-conservative movements claimed the attacks were 

inspired by Arab hatred for western values and ''what we stand for''. 

<p> But experts on the region, as well as Middle Eastern governments, insisted 

that whatever anger was directed at Washington was due to the perception that 

its policies were unfair, especially to Palestinians. 

<p> An earlier poll released by Zogby International last April appeared to bear 

that out. It found that large majorities of respondents in five countries, including 

several Gulf states and Egypt, felt very positively about U.S. science and technology, 

education, exports, and political values. 

<p> ''They told us in effect that they hated U.S. policy toward Iraq, toward other 

Arab counties, and most of all, U.S. policy toward Israel,'' said John Zogby, 

the firm's CEO, who is also James Zogby's brother. 

<p> The latest survey was aimed more at determining the personal values and perspectives 

of Arabs. 

<p> What it found is that Arabs, like most other ethnic and other groups around 

the world, are focused most on matters close to home, said James Zogby. 

<p> Asked to choose among a list of a dozen values they felt were important to 

teach their children, respondents selected ''self-respect, good health and hygiene, 

personal responsibility, respect for elders and working to achieve a better life'', 

according to the report. 

<p> When asked to rank political issues that were of importance to them, respondents 

placed civil and personal rights at the top, followed closely by health care. 

<p> But, in a highly significant twist, respondents ranked ''Palestine'' and ''the 

rights of Palestinians'' with their personal economic situation as the next-ranking 

concerns, far ahead of other issues, such as their national economies and their 

country's relationship with other Arab or non-Arab countries. 

<p> Palestine ranked as the highest political concern for Saudis and Moroccans, 

third highest among Egyptians, and fourth among Jordanians and Israeli Arabs. 

<p> ''The issue of Palestine doesn't exist as a foreign-policy concern,'' said 

James Zogby. ''Palestine is an existential, a personal issue,'' he noted, adding 

that Arabs may view it similarly to how U.S. Jews see the Nazi Holocaust. 

<p> As a result, Arabs' views about how Palestinians are being treated appear 

to play a major role in how they rate foreign countries, particularly the United 

States, he suggested. 

<p> Asked to rank 13 foreign countries, Israel consistently scored the lowest 

marks by far, followed, almost invariably, by the United States and the United 

Kingdom -- the two western countries most closely identified with support for 

Israel -- in that order. Respondents from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt gave 

the United States the lowest marks. 

<p> ''The attitudes toward the U.S. are framed in terms of its relationship with 

Israel,'' said James Zogby. 

<p> On the other hand, France, Canada, Japan, and Iran all received positive ratings 

from six of the eight countries covered by the survey, while China and Germany 

were viewed positively in five of the eight. 

<p> Those ranked in the middle included Russia, India, Pakistan and Turkey, although 

Turkey also received consistently negative scores. 

<p> Turkey's poor ratings in comparison to Iran were particularly striking. Neo-conservative 

commentators close to the anti-Iraq hawks in the Bush administration cite Turkey, 

whose military has close ties with Israel, as the model on which a ''liberated'' 

Iraq should be rebuilt. 

<p> On other issues, the survey found that a significant plurality of Arabs in 

seven of the eight countries prefer to identify themselves as ''Arabs'' rather 

than as citizens of specific countries or adherents of Islam or other religions. 

''The nation-state is still new,'' noted James Zogby. 

<p> The one exception was Lebanon, where respondents said they preferred to be 

identified as Lebanese rather than as belonging to any specific religious or ethnic 

group. 

<p> John Zogby said that the office of public diplomacy at the State Department, 

which has mounted a number of major initiatives designed to affect Arab and Islamic 

opinion toward the United States, has taken an interest in his firm's two surveys 

and may have used its earlier work in setting up Radio Sawa, which broadcasts 

music and news in the Middle East. </p>
