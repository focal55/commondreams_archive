<p>Earth's magnetic field - the force that protects us from deadly radiation bursts 

from outer space - is weakening dramatically. 

<P>Scientists have discovered that its strength has dropped precipitously over 

the past two centuries and could disappear over the next 1,000 years. 

<P>The effects could be catastrophic. Powerful radiation bursts, which normally 

never touch the atmosphere, would heat up its upper layers, triggering climatic 

disruption. Navigation and communication satellites, Earth's eyes and ears, would 

be destroyed and migrating animals left unable to navigate. 

<P>'Earth's magnetic field has disappeared many times before - as a prelude to 

our magnetic poles flipping over, when north becomes south and vice versa,' said 

Dr Alan Thomson of the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh. 

<P>'Reversals happen every 250,000 years or so, and as there has not been one 

for almost a million years, we are due one soon.' 

<P>For more than 100 years, scientists have noted the strength of Earth's magnetic 

field has been declining, but have disagreed about interpretations. Some said 

its drop was a precursor to reversal, others argued it merely indicated some temporary 

variation in field strength has been occurring. 

<P>But now Gauthier Hulot of the Paris Geophysical Institute has discovered Earth's 

magnetic field seems to be disappearing most alarmingly near the poles, a clear 

sign that a flip may soon take place. 

<P>Using satellite measurements of field variations over the past 20 years, Hulot 

plotted the currents of molten iron that generate Earth's magnetism deep underground 

and spotted huge whorls near the poles. 

<P>Hulot believes these vortices rotate in a direction that reinforces a reverse 

magnetic field, and as they grow and proliferate these eddies will weaken the 

dominant field: the first steps toward a new polarity, he says. 

<P>And as Scientific American reports this week, this interpretation has now been 

backed up by computer simulation studies. 

<P>How long a reversal might last is a matter of scientific controversy, however. 

Records of past events, embedded in iron minerals in ancient lava beds, show some 

can last for thousands of years - during which time the planet will have been 

exposed to batterings from solar radiation. On the other hand, other researchers 

say some flips may have lasted only a few weeks. 

<P>Exactly what will happen when Earth's magnetic field disappears prior to its 

re-emergence in a reversed orientation is also difficult to assess. Compasses 

would point to the wrong pole - a minor inconvenience. More importantly, low-orbiting 

satellites would be exposed to electromagnetic batterings, wrecking them. 

<P>In addition, many species of migrating animals and birds - from swallows to 

wildebeests - rely on innate abilities to track Earth's magnetic field. Their 

fates are impossible to gauge. 

<P>As to humans, our greatest risk would come from intense solar radiation bursts. 

Normally these are contained by the planet's magnetic field in space. However, 

if it disappears, particle storms will start to batter the atmosphere. 

<P>'These solar particles can have profound effects,' said Dr Paul Murdin, of 

the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. 'On Mars, when its magnetic field failed 

permanently billions of years ago, it led to its atmosphere being boiled off. 

On Earth, it will heat up the upper atmosphere and send ripples round the world 

with enormous, unpredictable effects on the climate.' 

<P>It is unlikely that humans could do much. Burrowing thousands of miles into 

solid rock to set things right would stretch the technological prowess of our 

descendants to bursting point, though such limitations do not worry film scriptwriters. 

Paramount's latest sci-fi thriller, The Core - directed by Englishman Jon Amiel, 

and starring Hilary Swank and Aaron Eckhart - depicts a world beset by just such 

a polar reversal, with radiation sweeping the planet. 

<P>The solution, according to the film, to be released next year, involves scientists 

drilling into Earth's mantle to set off a nuclear blast that will halt the reversal. 

<P>Given that temperatures at such depths rival those of the Sun's surface, such 

a task would seem impossible - except, of course, in Hollywood.
