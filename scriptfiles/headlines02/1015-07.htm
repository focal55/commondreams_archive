<p> As the administration prepares for war with Iraq, a new mantra has emerged 

in the campaign to win the hearts and minds of Americans and, in effect, put Saddam 

Hussein on notice. 

<p>"America speaks with one voice," says President Bush. 

<p> In Washington, Bush, having been empowered by both houses of Congress to use 

force, seems to face very little opposition on Iraq. 

<p> <b>On the streets of America, nothing could be further from the truth. </b> 

<p><b> Across the nation, in city after city, ABCNEWS found voices of opposition, 

and many of them were from military towns.</b>

</font>"I am not convinced President Bush has yet made the case," said Miles Harvey, 

a San Diego retiree. San Diego is home port to the Navy's Pacific Fleet, which 

directly employs more than 100,000 people. 

<p> "We have to be convinced that there is a credible threat from Iraq and that's 

what I haven't seen," said Harvey. 

<p> Algene Miller, a Vietnam War veteran, said he was worried about potential 

casualties. 

<p> "You can't have a war without them," he said. "I know, I've been there." 

<p> On the other side of the country, in Charleston, S.C. &#0151; home to The 

Citadel military college and Charleston Air Force Base &#0151; there is also opposition, 

especially from those who remember U.S. forces becoming bogged down in Vietnam 

while losing support back home. 

<p> "If the president could show a clear and present danger I would support action 

against Iraq, but I don't support it without any evidence, " said Robert Rhame, 

a retired businessman who served in Vietnam. 

<p> "To me, our economy is far more important than removing Saddam Hussein from 

power," he said. 

<p> <span class="subhead"><b>Skepticism Over President&#146;s Motives</b></span> 

<p> In the Central Plains states, there is concern about the prospect of the United 

Staets going to war alone. 

<p> At a coffee shop in Denver's Cherry Creek neighborhood, homemaker Christa 

Rogers said unilateral action would be a mistake. "I think we have to go with 

other people, other countries, I don't think we can take this on, on our own," 

she said. 

<p> Her friend Cathy Roper agreed. "It all seems too fast," Roper added. "We need 

to do something, but it seems like it's really being shoved onto everybody, it 

seems too fast." 

<p> In addition to concern over timing and unilateral pre-emptive action, people 

question the president's motives. Many people told ABCNEWS they thought it was 

a "diversion from the faltering economy." 

<p> Debra Cassens, a businesswoman from San Diego, said it was about revenge. 

<p> "Bush is trying to settle a score that began with his father," she said referring 

to the failed Iraqi assassination attempt on the president's father following 

the Persian Gulf War. 

<p> John Schneider, also from San Diego, said, "I think the president wants to 

take action to enhance his own position. 

<p> "The war powers resolution was timed to benefit those running for election 

this November," Schneider said. 

<p> Although organized demonstrations have yet to produce large crowds, there 

have been several protests. In Los Angeles, 3,000 people gathered outside the 

federal building this month and chanted "no war," while a group of American Indians 

staged a peace dance nearby. 

<p> In Portland, Ore., approximately 6,000 people recently crowded the narrow 

streets to march and be heard while about 10,000 people gathered in New York City's 

Central Park to oppose war plans. 

<p> "What concerns me," said Rhame, the retired Vietnam War vet, "is what we do 

over there could bring more terror to the United States." 

<p> Denver resident Cassens agreed. "We need to build some bridges with the Muslim 

world, not make things worse," she said. 

<p> Contrary to what the president says, when it comes to war, Americans do not 

speak with one voice. A national day of protest has been scheduled for Oct. 26.</p>
