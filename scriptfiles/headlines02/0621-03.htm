<p>Warming temperatures around the world are increasing the geographical range 

and virulence of diseases, a trend that could mean more devastating epidemics 

in humans, animals, and plants, according to a report published in the magazine 

Science yesterday.

</table>Already, the dengue virus in Latin America and Rift Valley fever in the Middle 

East, which can cause people to vomit blood, have expanded their deadly range. 

Meanwhile, an oyster disease has gained a foothold in Maine waters, the report 

said.</P>

<P>Researchers have long accepted that global warming will affect a wide range 

of organisms, but they are only now beginning to predict what those will be. While 

climate change scientists have studied a handful of human diseases, yesterday's 

report was the first to study dozens of diseases in both humans and nonhumans.</P>

<P>''We are seeing lots of anecdotes and they are beginning to tell a story,'' 

said Andrew P. Dobson, professor at Princeton University's department of ecology 

and evolutionary biology and one of the authors. ''It's a much more scary threat 

than bioterrorism.''</P>

<P>The report comes at a crucial time. Earlier this month, the Bush administration 

concluded that manmade sources of heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases were responsible 

for global warming. Yesterday's report adds to the growing evidence that nearly 

every part of the natural world could suffer in some way from the long-term warming 

trend. </P>

<P>The report notes that many regions, including New England, could be losing 

one of their best defenses against disease: cold weather. Every fall, mosquitoes 

that may be carrying the deadly West Nile virus, for example, are killed off before 

they multiply and spread the disease too widely. But as global warming heats up 

the Earth, even by minute degrees, disease-carrying organisms may regenerate faster 

or go into new areas where populations may have little or no natural resistance.</P>

<P>''It's possible that the time that it takes for [a disease-carrying organism] 

population to double might be halved with a single degree or half degree of warming,'' 

said Rick Ostfeld, an animal ecologist at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in 

Millbrook, N.Y., one of authors. ''What we found were striking patterns of climate 

warming and spread of disease, and greater incidence of disease.''</P>

<P>The report notes that with increased temperature, mosquitoes that carry the 

dengue virus bite more often. Slime mold grows faster on eelgrass. Parasites that 

attach to butterflies gather in greater density.</P>

<P>Not everyone will consider the news bad, however. A fungus in frogs decreases 

with higher temperatures. An avian cholera that favors cold weather could disappear.</P>

<P>Of course, not all disease spread can be attributed to climate change. Authors 

say many other reasons can account for it, including increased human travel and 

resistant bugs.</P>

<P>Still, the spread of Rift Valley fever and even eastern oyster disease appears 

to be largely related to long-term temperature fluctuations. Rift Valley, a particularly 

nasty disease that can make victims go blind and vomit blood, spread across the 

Red Sea in 2000 and killed 200 people in Yemen and Saudi Arabia; and its range 

is expanding. Eastern oyster disease is now found in Maine waters that have warmed 

slightly in recent years. </P>

<P>''The disease is normally limited by cold winters,'' said C. Drew Harvell, 

lead author of the report and a Cornell professor in the department of ecology 

and evolutionary biology. She said the virus was in Long Island and then jumped 

to Maine.</P>

<P>''While there are multiple reasons for the redistribution of emerging disease 

... it's clear there is an emerging pattern here,'' said Paul Epstein, associate 

director of Harvard Medical School's Center for Health and the Global Environment. 

''We've clearly underestimated the rate at which climate would change, and we 

have underestimated the response to ecological systems to that warming.''</P>
