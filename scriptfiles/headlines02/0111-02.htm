            The Enron affair exploded around the Bush Presidency last night, as 

            his administration's top legal officer was forced to remove himself 

            from the newly launched criminal investigation &#173; and the accounting 

            firm that audited the failed energy giant's books admitted it had 

            destroyed thousands of documents relating to the case.

            <p> Yesterday, the White House shifted into full scandal defense mode. Mr Bush 

              intervened in the affair directly for the first time, ordering the 

              Treasury Department to review federal pension regulations. He also 

              denied he had ever discussed the company's difficulties with Kenneth 

              Lay, Enron's chairman and a long time friend and benefactor of the 

              President. </p>

            An especially shocking aspect of the Enron d&eacute;bacle has been 

            the way in which senior executives were able to cash in up to $1bn 

            (&#163;700m) of Enron stock and options in the 18 months before the 

            company began to unravel last autumn &#173; while many employees, 

            obliged to hold stock in pensions schemes, saw retirement funds virtually 

            wiped out. 

            <p> Already, civil suits have been filed against 29 Enron directors 

              and senior executives, charging they sold shares while knowing the 

              company was in dire trouble. The Justice Department investigation 

              will examine whether Enron, in the last few years, was no more than 

              a giant fraud. </p>

            <p> It was disclosure of unreported debts shielded by secret partnerships 

              run by senior Enron executives, and its October admission that it 

              had overstated its profits by $586m in the previous four years that 

              created the crisis of investor confidence that drove Enron into 

              bankruptcy at the start of December. In the process, what was once 

              the seventh-largest US corporation saw its shares plunge from $85 

              to under $1 apiece, in the largest corporate collapse in US financial 

              history. </p>

            <p> Last night, Arthur Andersen, Enron's accountants stunned the US 

              financial community by revealing its employees had destroyed a "significant" 

              number of paper and electronic documents relating to its audit had 

              been destroyed. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Wall Street's 

              top regulatory body, described the admission as an "extremely serious 

              matter". </p>

            <p> In a separate embarrassment for Mr Bush, Attorney General John 

              Ashcroft, head of the Justice Department and thus the country's 

              top law enforcement official, announced he would have no involvement 

              in the investigation. Mr Ashcroft reportedly accepted up to $60,000 

              to help his failed 2000 Senate campaign. </p>

            <p> In the short term, the probe could take some of the sting out 

              of the Congressional hearings due to start next month into the collapse. 

              Scheduled witnesses, including Mr Lay and other senior executives, 

              are likely to be the object of the federal investigation and under 

              threat of criminal indictment, they may be able to say little to 

              interrogators on Capitol Hill. </p>

            <p> Even so, the once-close relationship between Mr Lay and the President 

              will come under ever-fiercer scrutiny. Denying he had ever discussed 

              Enron's finances with Mr Lay, Mr Bush said had not seen him since 

              last May. He expressed "great concern" for the people who had entrusted 

              their money to Enron, and then "for whatever reason, based upon 

              some rule or regulation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy." 

            </p>

            <p> The real target for Democrats will be the large political donations 

              Enron made to the Republican party, including more than $100,000 

              to Mr Bush's election campaign, and a similar contribution to the 

              2001 inauguration gala.</p>
