<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp; - New House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, 

a liberal who has been at odds with President Bush on Iraq, pledged on Sunday 

to support him if the United States goes to war in Iraq.

<p>



		"Yes, I would support the president," the California  Democrat responded on NBC's "Meet the Press" program when asked  if she would back Bush even if he opted for military action  without U.N. support.<p>



		Pelosi, who voted against the congressional resolution  authorizing force in Iraq, stressed that she still believed a  diplomatic approach was preferable to a military one, and if  military action does become necessary, she thinks a  multilateral response is preferable to a unilateral one.<p>



		But if U.S. soldiers are put in harm's way, "I certainly  will support the action of the president," said Pelosi, who was  elected this week to succeed Dick Gephardt of Missouri as the  leader of the minority Democrats in the House. She is the first  woman to head either party in Congress.<p>



		"I hope that it does not come to that," said Pelosi, who is  the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. She said  she is very concerned that Iraq could use chemical or  biological weapons on U.S. troops.<p>



		"I don't trust Saddam Hussein for one second. Let's be very  clear, this is a person who does very evil things and he is a  menace," she said. "But nonetheless we want to make sure that  we can resolve this and show our greatness by resolving it  diplomatically, rather than just showing our power by going in  militarily."<p>



		She also declined to join in with Senate Majority Leader  Tom Daschle's comments last week questioning whether Washington  has really made progress in the war on terror.<p>



		"What is enough? Enough is a guarantee that it won't happen  again," she said, adding that "The war on terror is about more  than Osama bin Laden."<p>



		Questioned several times about her liberalism, Pelosi  stressed that she saw her role as unifying her party and  developing consensus, not necessarily imposing her own views.<p>



		"The role of the leader is to build consensus in the  party," she said. For instance, she personally opposes making  Bush's tax cuts permanent, she said, but she will seek  consensus among Democrats and evaluate economic proposals in  terms of their fairness and whether they can create jobs and  grow the economy.

<p> Pelosi succeeds Gephardt, who is stepping down from the leadership after Democrats 

unexpectedly lost seats in the Nov. 5 elections.
