<p>LONDON   - The learning gulf across the globe is  deepening, with schooling systems in some countries actually  regressing, the United Nations said on Wednesday.<p>Eighty-three countries were on track to deliver by 2015 an  Education For All (EFA) target, set by the World Education  Forum in Dakar two and a half years ago.<p>But at the same time, 70 other countries would fail to meet  the target and some were actually going backwards, it said.<p>The problem was being made worse by a shortage of teachers  -- some 35 million more are needed throughout the world.

<p>The findings appear in the "<a href="http://www.unesco.org/bpi/eng/unescopress/2002/02-93e.shtml" target="_new">Education 

For All Global Monitoring Report: Is The World On Track?</a>" published by the 

United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

<p>"It reconfirms the Forum's diagnosis that almost one-third  of the world's population live in countries where achieving the  EFA goals remains a dream," said education expert and co-author  of the report, Christopher Colclough.<p>The report said 28 countries accounting for 26 percent of  the world's population might not meet any of the three  measurable goals of Dakar -- universal primary education (UPE),  gender equality and the halving of illiteracy rates.<p>Most of these were in sub-Saharan Africa, but the list also  included India and Pakistan.<p>Another 43 nations accounting for 35.6 percent of the  world's population risked missing at least one of the goals,  the Paris-based UNESCO said.<p>"At current rates of progress, UPE is unlikely to be  reached in 57 countries," the report said, adding that 43 of  them including several in central and eastern Europe were  actually regressing.<p>Efforts to achieve gender parity were making ground but  still left much to be desired, while attempts to improve  literacy rates were making relatively little headway.<p>"Unless a much greater effort is made, a total of 78  countries will not be able to halve their rate of illiteracy by  2015. These include four of the world's most populous  countries, Bangladesh, China, India and Pakistan," UNESCO said.<p>It added that these four together accounted for 61 percent  of the world's illiterate adults.

<p>However, efforts to hit the Dakar targets were being severely hampered by a 

world shortage of teachers, with three million more needed in sub-Saharan Africa 

alone out of the estimated need to find up to 35 million more worldwide.
