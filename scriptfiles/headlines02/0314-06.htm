A total of 1,250 service members left the U.S. military last year after declaring themselves gay in what amounted to the largest exodus of gay service members since 1987, according to an advocacy group for gays in the military.

<p>The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, in a report scheduled for release today based on Pentagon statistics, also says gay discharges have more than doubled since 1994, after the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy was implemented. It permits gays to serve in the military as long as they do not engage in homosexual conduct or reveal their sexual orientation.</p>

    <p>The advocacy group faulted the Bush administration and U.S. military commanders for allowing a "pervasive anti-gay sentiment to fester and grow" throughout the ranks, concluding: "Harassment continues in epidemic proportions."</p>

    <p>While federal law bans gays from military service, "don't ask, don't tell" prohibits commanders from asking service members about their sexual orientation or pursuing investigations absent evidence of homosexual conduct or a service member's acknowledgment. The policy was expanded in 2000 to prohibit harassment of service members suspected of being gay.</p>

    <p>But SLDN, a privately funded organization based in Washington, alleges in its report that every branch of the military has "virtually ignored" an "anti-harassment action plan" adopted in 2000 by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. It was adopted after the slaying of Army Pfc. Barry Winchell in 1999 by fellow soldiers at Fort Campbell, Ky., who suspected he was gay.</p>

    <p>The group singled out Army leadership for tolerating anti-gay harassment, reporting that 616 men and women were discharged from the Army for being gay, including 222 at Fort Campbell, more than any other Army installation.</p>

    <p>"The story in the Army this year, much more so than in the past, is about failed leadership driven by callous indifference," the group stated. "Army leaders, up and down the chain of command, have failed to implement the safety and training initiatives launched in the wake of Pfc. Winchell's murder."</p>

    <p>Lt. Col. James Cassella, a Pentagon spokesman, took strong exception to the group's findings, saying the military's commitment remains "steadfast" to enforcing the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. "We're taking extraordinary measures to foster an environment that's free of any type of harassment based on respect for fellow service members," he said.</p>

    <p>Cassella said gay discharges often do not connote harassment, since service members who go to their superiors and acknowledge that they are gay are discharged from the military as a matter of law.</p>

    <p>"Discharges and harassment are two different things," he said. "Discharges relate to people who are in violation of the homosexual conduct policy."</p>

    <p>Elaine Kanellis, an Army spokeswoman, said 92 percent of the Army's 616 gay discharges were based on "simple statements" by soldiers that they are gay. "All that is required is for the soldier to claim they are homosexual," Kanellis said. "Those claims are routinely accepted at face value and not investigated."</p>

    <p>Kanellis and Col. Tom Begines, chief of Army media relations, attributed the large number of gay discharges at Fort Campbell, home of the 101st Airborne Division, to a policy decision made after Winchell's murder to expedite the processing of gay discharges for the safety of gay service members.</p>

    <p>"The increase should be viewed as preventative rather than punitive," Begines said. "All of that, I think, is to the Army's credit."</p>

    <p>Kanellis said that once the expediting of gay discharges at Fort Campbell was discontinued late last year out of concern that nongay service members were improperly obtaining gay discharges as an easy way to leave the military, the number of gay discharges dropped from 33 in July to three in December.</p>

    

<p>C. Dixon Osburn, executive director of SLDN, responded that there is a strong correlation between increases in gay discharges and increased harassment. "The fact that this is the highest number of discharges since 1987 says something to us," Osburn said. "There are reasons for that, and one of the reasons for that is harassment."</p>
