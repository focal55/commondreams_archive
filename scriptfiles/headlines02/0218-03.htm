BAGHDAD  - 

Iraqi newspapers said on Monday the

United States was launching a psychological war on Iraq in

preparation for military strikes on the country.

<p>

Babel, the newspaper of President Saddam Hussein's eldest

son Uday, said that as part of the "psychological war against

our country" the United States "concentrates on reiterating its

aggressive intentions on Iraq to prepare peoples minds to

accept this."

<p>

It said the U.S. administration was preparing for military

action against Iraq after the failure of its policy to

"dismantle Iraq and its territorial integrity" -- a reference

to the 1991 Gulf war over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<p>

"These desperate attempts will fail as they have failed in

the past," Babel said in a front-page editorial.

<p>

Iraq on Friday tested war sirens throughout the capital

Baghdad for the first time since February last year when U.S.

planes attacked a radar system in southern Baghdad.

<p>

Speculation has mounted that Washington might launch

military action against Baghdad after President Bush  described

Iraq, Iran and North Korea  last month as forming an "axis of

evil" developing weapons of mass destruction and sponsoring

terror.

<p>

Bush has also warned Saddam his country will face the

consequences if he does not allow U.N. weapons inspectors to

return.

<p>

But senior U.S. officials said Bush had not yet decided

whether to take military action against Iraq.

<p>

Iraq has barred the arms inspectors, charged with scrapping

its chemical, nuclear and biological arms programs, since U.S.

and British warplanes bombed Baghdad in December 1998. Iraq

denies it has any weapons of mass destruction.

<p>

The ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra said Washington

was using the issue of the inspectors as an excuse to attack.

<p>

"America wants the inspectors to return in order to

manufacture a new crisis with Iraq which it will use as a

pretext to attack Iraq under a U.N. cover," Thawra said.

<p>

The paper echoed a recent statement by Iraq's vice

president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, in which he said there was no

need for the inspection teams to return.

<p>

Secretary of State Colin Powell   on Sunday rejected fresh

assurances from Saddam that Iraq was not obtaining weapons of

mass destruction and reaffirmed that the United States would

act to counter what it sees as clear and present danger.
