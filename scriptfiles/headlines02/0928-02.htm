            <p>WASHINGTON - Hundreds of activists opposed to the corporate model 

              for globalization demonstrated in the streets here yesterday to 

              protest the start of annual World Bank and International Monetary 

              Fund meetings.

                  September 27, 2002. Finance chiefs from the world's richest 

                  nations gathered in Washington under the shadow of war fears 

                  and spiraling oil prices to discuss how to keep a shaky global 

                  recovery on track. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)<br>

</table></font>The protests were mostly peaceful, although the predominantly young 

              activists occasionally skirmished with the overwhelming police presence 

              that shadowed them through the day. Police said that about 650 people 

              among the estimated 1,500 to 2,000 demonstrators had been arrested.</P>

            <P>About 1,700 police came from as far away as Chicago and Macon, 

              Ga., to help patrol the city during the annual gathering of the 

              two institutions this weekend, said Sergeant Joe Gentile, a spokesman 

              for the District of Columbia police.</P>

            <P>The protests are expected to continue today when thousands of activists 

              plan to rally on the Mall before marching past the White House.</P>

            <P>The activists were protesting the policies of the World Bank and 

              IMF, which they argue harm developing countries. Some protesters 

              also decried the apparently imminent conflict with Iraq.</P>

            <P>''We're hoping to make a very loud and boisterous, resounding cry 

              that will be heard across the country and around the world, a cry 

              that undemocratic, unaccountable institutions have taken control 

              of our lives,'' said David Levy of Newton, Mass., an organizer with 

              the Mobilization for Global Justice, a group that helped coordinate 

              the weekend's activities. ''We have to wrest that power from the 

              hands of corporate lobbyists who fill the halls of the World Bank, 

              IMF, and Congress as well. And we have to forge truly democratic 

              decision-making bodies.''</P>

            <P>A different group, the Anti-Capitalist Convergence, organized demonstrations 

              at different sites around downtown, drawing a couple of hundred 

              people at each.</P>

            <P>''People are against the IMF and World Bank and capitalist policies 

              without any protections for labor and the environment,'' said Gregg 

              Mosson, a D.C.-based professional writer holding a sign for passing 

              traffic that said, ''No More Capitalist Wars.''</P>

            <P>The protesters, some of whom covered their faces, hoped to shut 

              down chunks of the city to tie up traffic, and in a way they succeeded 

              - the police, many in full riot gear, responded in such numbers 

              that they themselves shut down surrounding streets.</P>

            <P>Early in the morning, a couple of hundred protesters gathered at 

              a park about six blocks from the White House to march against capitalism. 

              They went a block down a major street before being diverted by a 

              police blockade into a side street where authorities bottled them 

              up. A stand-off followed, punctuated by a figure clad entirely in 

              black, with his face covered - the garb of the self-described ''Black 

              Block'' - hurling a pair of objects through the window of a Citibank 

              branch. Eventually police - holding their clubs horizontally to 

              push back on the crowd - arrested most of the group, putting protesters 

              on city buses in plastic cuffs and taking them away.</P>

            <P>The scene was played out during rush hour, frustrating bystanders 

              trying to get to work.</P>

            <P>Ben Stanfield, who was unable to get into his office at the National 

              Center on Education and the Economy, described himself as ''sympathetic 

              to the cause, but not to the methods.''</P>

            <P>''I think they could accomplish a lot more if they actually targeted 

              the issues and not the people who can't affect the issues,'' he 

              said. ''Their right to protest ends at my right to get to work.''</P>

            <P>A couple of hours later, a similar confrontation took place at 

              Pershing Park, near the White House. Police, some on horses and 

              bicycles, surrounded the protesters and slowly closed ranks around 

              them, eventually arresting everyone in the perimeter. In arranging 

              the activities, the Anti-Capitalist Convergence had not gotten permits.</P>

            <P>A sympathetic crowd, which had not entered the park before police 

              sealed it off, chanted, ''Let them free, let them free, this is 

              not democracy'' and other slogans.</P>

            <P>''Charges vary from disorderly conduct to crossing a police line, 

              to demonstrating without a permit, inciting a riot. There's a number 

              of different charges; it just depends on what they were doing at 

              the time,'' said police spokesman Tony O'Leary. </P>

            <P>A student who had come from Seattle and identified herself only 

              as Savahn said she felt intimidated by the police presence. ''If 

              they would allow us to assemble peaceably, it would be far less 

              of a hassle for the city,'' she said.</p>
