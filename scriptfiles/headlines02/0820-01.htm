the International Criminal Court could spell difficulty for newly inaugurated

US officials have asked allies to sign on to a waiver so that US troops could 

not be tried for genocide, and before the United Nations court.</p> 

<p>"I don't like the way the United States has cast this debate because it is 

tied to international drug war aid," said former economy minister Juan Camilo 

Restrepo.</p>

<p>Colombia is the third-largest recipient of US foreign aid in the world, after 

Israel and Egypt.</p>

<p>Under the American Service Members Protection Act signed into law by US President 

George W. Bush last week, Washington could withhold military aid from ICC member 

countries that do not sign bilateral exceptions for US troops.</p>

<p>"That has the bad taste of blackmail," said the former Conservative Party presidential 

candidate.</p>

<p>"(It amounts to) aggressive diplomacy with poor countries."</p>

<p>Former leftist presidential candidate Luis Eduardo Garzon wondered who would 

be responsible if US personnel committed excesses in Colombia.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I believe the request is the height of cynicism.</p>

<p>"We are losing any possibility of having a minimum of independence (from the 

United States)," he said.</p>

<p>Former Conservative Party foreign minister Noemi Sanin recalled that Colombia 

has ratified the court and should act with other Latin American countries.</p>

<p>"Colombia rightly approved the International Criminal Court because crime has 

no borders.</p>

<p>"Colombia should not make that decision alone, but in unity with all of Latin 

America should take a common stand."</p>

<p>Maria Teresa Bernal, director of a grass-roots peace group, Redepaz, disagreed 

with the US proposal.</p>

<p>"If the United States has offered economic aid and military assistance, I believe 

it can turn into blackmail for a country that has ratified the court before the 

world community."</p>

<p>On August 5, Colombia became the 77th country to ratify the Rome Treaty that 

established the court, which came into being on July 1.</p>

<p>"It is absurd for the United States to demand democracy and respect for human 

rights only when it applies to others," Bernal said.</p>

<p>However, the Uribe government said that it would let its position be known 

in good time.</p>

<p>"What we have clear is that the United States is a great ally of Colombia, 

is a generous contributor to the struggle against crime, corruption and violence 

and for human rights," Vice President Francisco Santos said Saturday.</p>

<p>US undersecretary of state for political affairs Marc Grossman urged Colombia 

to sign the bilateral deal to give US troops immunity during a visit to Bogota 

last week.</p>

<p>"We have serious, serious reservations (on) the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p>"We believe the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has no checks 

and balances on him or her. ... We think that's too bad," he said.</p>

<p>"So we have proposed to the government of Colombia that they sign with us what 

is called un article 98 agreement. And that's to protect American service men 

and women and official Americans serving in Colombia for what we worry will be 

political prosecutions by this Court," Grossman said.</p>
