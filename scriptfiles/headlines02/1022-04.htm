<p>UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 21 — In an episode that raised new questions about security at United Nations headquarters, demonstrators today, protesting the Bush administration's confrontation with Baghdad, got inside the General Assembly, where they shouted, "No war in Iraq!" United Nations officials said.</p>

</table></font>The authorities said United Nations security officers had removed the group of 13, who had entered the visitors' gallery in the Assembly hall as part of a regular tour that went through routine security procedures. They were handed over to the New York City police. </p>

<P> Most of the protesters were college students from a New York group called No Blood for Oil! — a recently formed coalition that says it plans "direct action" against a United States attack on Iraq, according to Eric Laursen, a spokesman for the group.</p>

<P> The protesters were apparently not armed or carrying any unusual items. Because of tighter security at its entrance, they were not able to approach the Security Council, whose members are debating a resolution on Iraq. </p>

<P> Six other protesters from the group, also chanting antiwar slogans, were arrested today outside the United States mission, across from the United Nations.</p>

<P> As recently as Oct. 3, an American postal worker scaled the front fence and fired pistol shots through upper windows in the building to protest human rights violations in North Korea.</p>

<P> United Nations security officials have hesitated to cancel the popular public visits inside the headquarters building, which draw many schoolchildren, even though it has long faced terrorist threats.</p>

<P> Michael McCann, the head of United Nations security, said today that the protesters 

had breached no security procedures. "The public loves seeing the meetings in 

session," he said. "As long as the building is open with guided tours, this is 

a risk we run."</p>
