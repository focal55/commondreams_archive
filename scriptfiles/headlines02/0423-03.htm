UNITED NATIONS  - The United Nations is sending a five-member team to probe reported atrocities by Israeli military forces in the Jenin refugee camp last week.

<p>

"I am not sending a team of prosecutors or criminal investigators", U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters Monday. "The team will try to get the facts as quickly as possible."

<p>







Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari will lead the team, consisting of former U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, former International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) head Cornelio Sammaruga, retired U.S. General William Nash, and Peter Fitzgerald, a former senior U.N. official in Cambodia and El Salvador.

<p>







Team members were chosen in consultation with the U.S. and Israeli authorities, Annan said, adding that the Israeli government had assured him it would cooperate with the U.N. team. "They said they have nothing to hide," he said.

<p>







Over the weekend, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson said three U.N. officials would be unacceptable as fact-finders: Terje Roed-Larsen, the U.N.'s Special Coordinator for the Middle East; Peter Hansen, head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA); and Mary Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.

<p>









All three have been outspoken in condemning Israeli atrocities in the occupied territories.

<p>







Phyllis Bennis, of the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies, said that since Israel is the occupying power and the main subject of the fact-finding mission, it has no right to determine the composition of the U.N. team.

<p>







"There are precedents here, especially in Iraq, where Baghdad tried to impose restrictions on the composition of the U.N. Special Commission to exclude Americans and Britons," she told IPS.

<p>







The United Nations refused to accept those terms, stating appropriately that no subject government had the right to dictate terms to the world body.

<p>







"Israel has no right to pick and choose its human rights interlocutors. The attempt to exclude Roed-Larsen and Hansen, two of the U.N.'s most experienced diplomats in the region, and Robinson, the U.N.'s top human rights official, is particularly egregious," said Bennis.

<p>









"Now that the tide of international and growing domestic pressure has forced the (George W.) Bush administration to accept the international consensus, and allow the United Nations to send an investigation team,'' she added, ''we must insure that the ability of the commission to work unhindered to uncover the reality of what Roed-Larsen called horrifying must not be compromised."

<p>







After a visit to the Jenin refugee camp last week, Roed-Larsen said: "Let me be very clear. I have not and am not accusing anyone of massacres; we do not have the full facts from Jenin. But what I saw yesterday was truly appalling. The destruction was massive; the stench overwhelming."

<p>







Roed-Larsen also said that combating terrorism does not give the Israelis "a blank check to kill civilians."

<p>







On Sunday, the New York Times quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying that Roed-Larsen's action was "something the foreign ministry should consider so serious that we have to consider serious measures."

<p>







Annan said Monday he was disappointed that senior U.N. officials have been criticized thus. Roed-Larsen, he added, described what he saw "and he did not use the word massacre."

<p>







Asked about the absence of Roed-Larsen, Hansen and Robinson, Annan said "there was never any intention of making them part of the fact-finding mission." Mission members, he added, would be at liberty to talk to the three officials.

<p>







Annan said that the fact-finding team would assemble in Europe later this week and travel to the region as quickly as possible.

<p>







The Security Council adopted a resolution on Friday welcoming Annan's initiative "to develop accurate information regarding recent events in the Jenin refugee camp".

<p>







Annan declined to a timeframe for the mission to complete its investigations.</p>
