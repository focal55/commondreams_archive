<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The US detention of prisoners from the Afghan conflict at a military outpost in Cuba is "un-American," human rights advocates said as they sought to revive a legal challenge to the practice.</p>

<p>The claim Wednesday came six months after the first shackled detainees from the US war on terror were flown to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba where 534 men from 39 countries are now being held in a state of legal limbo.</p>

<p>Rights advocates opposing the legality and of the detentions on behalf of some of the prisoners, who have been denied access to legal counsel, asked an appeals court to overturn an earlier judgment that threw out their case.</p>

<p>"Our laws prohibit holding them the way we're holding them," said Stephen Yagman, the attorney for the group of clergy, lawyers and journalists challenging the detentions. "It's a paradox, un-American," he added.</p>

<p>Yagman said it was "absurd in a democratic system" to hold the prisoners incommunicado and deny them a hearing in an established US court.</p>

<p>"These are people who are being held perhaps in perpetuity," Yagman told the judges of the federal ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in the city of Pasadena, near Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The appeal came after a US federal judge in February threw out the first legal challenge to the military detentions, saying the advocates had no legal right to bring it on behalf of the prisoners with whom they had no ties.</p>

<p>The rights advocates had claimed that the detentions violated the US Constitution and the Geneva Convention on the rights of prisoners and wanted the charges against the prisoners to be defined in a US court.</p>

<p>No charges have been publicly filed against the detainees and they are being held indefinitely as enemy combatants in a war whose limits defy clear definition.</p>

<p>But the US government moved Wednesday to block the attempt to revive the case, insisting that the rights advocates had no business bringing the case as they were not linked to the detainees in any way.</p>

<p>"There's absolutely no relationship between the petitioners and the detainees," US Deputy Solicitor General Paul Clement to the judges. "There has to be some significant relationship." </p>

<p>Only the friends or family of the prisoners would be in any position to challenge their detentions, he said, adding that no US court had the jurisdiction necessary to hear the advocates' case.</p>

<p>"If these individuals can litigate on behalf of the detainees, then any individual can litigate" on their behalf, Clement argued, adding that the detainees represented a potential threat to national security following the September 11 terror strikes on US targets.</p>

<p>The appellate panel took the case under submission and was expected to issue 

a ruling at a later date.</p>
