<p>On any given Wednesday night, specks of candlelight illuminate the square as 

people gather quietly, praying for peace.</P>

<P>For about a month, people from community churches have stood near the gazebo 

on Wednesday evenings from 5-6 p.m. holding a peaceful protest against the possibility 

of war between the United States and Iraq.</P>

Each Wednesday evening, candles flicker near the gazebo on the square in downtown 

Wooster as people gather quietly, praying for peace and holding a peaceful protest 

against the possibility of a war between the United States and Iraq. Rakim Sunra

On average, Pastor Carroll Meyer of Westminster Presbyterian Church said, about 

two dozen people congregate.</P> 

<P>"All of us are concerned about the issues that seem to be developing," Meyer 

said.</P>

<P>The demonstration is a far cry from anti-war demonstrations that flash across 

the evening news, the pastor said.</P>

<P>"This is a quiet kind of demonstration," he said. "We're not yelling in the 

streets. We're quietly talking about praying for peace."</P>

<P>Cindy Gooch joined the vigils because she's frustrated.</P>

<P>"Some of us don't know what else to do," Gooch said.</P>

<P>With the possibility of war with Iraq looming, participating in the demonstrations 

gives Gooch a sense of accomplishment.</P>

<P>"I have the feeling that I haven't just been sitting at home, bemoaning the 

fact," Gooch said.</P>

<P>As an avid churchgoer, Gooch said mixing her patriotism with spirituality was 

hard at first. But after meeting people at the demonstrations, it was easier to 

blend church and state.</P>

<P>Participants are from all spectrums of the rainbow, young and old, Gooch said.</P>

<P>"It's refreshing to be around younger patriotism," she said. "It shows a different 

point of view and activity."</P>

<P>One group of participants who are especially affected by the possibility of 

war include students at The College of Wooster who are from Mideast countries.</P>

<P>For about two years the group has been studying conflicts in the Middle East, 

Meyer said. With the conflicts escalating, the group decided to join the demonstrations.</P>

<P>"It is very personal for them," Meyer said. "Their sisters and brothers, their 

homeland. When we think about what's happening there, it's very personal and painful."</P>

<P>"We don't want our nation to go headlong into war by ourselves," Gooch said. 

"If there's a backing of other nations, that's another matter."</P>

<P>She said the United States needs to step back to look at the picture as a whole 

before drastic measures are taken.</P>

<P>"We need to give Iraq another chance," Gooch said. "before we do something 

horrible. Many innocent people, who Hussein has taken advantage of, are going 

to be killed."</P>

<P>The square demonstrations may be small, but Meyer and Gooch hope they send 

a mighty message.</P>

<P>"We know we're a small group of people in a very large community," Meyer said. 

"We need to constantly remind people that there are alternatives and that we need 

to work on those alternatives."</P>

<P>The right to hold demonstrations is one freedom this nation offers that Gooch 

said she's thankful for.</P>

<P>"I don't want to live any place else," she said. "This is the country I want 

to be in."</P>
