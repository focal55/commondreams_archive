Four policemen have been tailing Jos&#233; Bov&#233;, the French farmer and activist, 

who is in Brazil to attend the second World Social Forum - the anti-capitalist 

counterpoint to the Davos World Economic Forum in New York. 

<P>Mr Bov&#233; became the unwitting star of last year's inaugural event, also 

in Brazil, when he helped destroy a plantation of genetically modified soya and 

was ordered to leave the country. He has returned to Porto Alegre as an organiser 

of the summit, which has grown from 4,000 delegates last year to 40,000 this. 

<P>Under the banner of "Another world is possible", the broad collection of left-leaning 

activists is set to discuss alternative visions of how the world should work. 

<P>Nobel laureates like Guatemala's Rigoberta Menchu and Argentina's Adolfo Perez 

Esquivel are expected to attend the forum, which was started in 2001 with the 

intention of becoming an annual mirror to Davos. 

<P>Six French junior ministers and three French presidential candidates will be 

present, as will United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson. 

<P>"It's about the policies governing globalisation that give a pre-eminence to 

economic and business concerns to the complete exclusion of labour, human rights 

and judicial concerns," said James Garrison, a delegate to the forum and chief 

organiser of the Commission on Globalisation. </p>
