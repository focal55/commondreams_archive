<p>BOSTON -- </b>A peace activist is challenging U.S. Sen. John Kerry to protest 

Kerry's vote in favor of using military force in Iraq. The activist calls her 

write-in candidacy a "referendum on commitment to peace in Massachusetts." 

<P></P>

Randall Forsberg, a Democrat who has been active in the nuclear freeze movement 

for more than 20 years, said unilateral U.S. action on Iraq would weaken the United 

Nations and hurt international arms control efforts. (<a href="http://www.rforsberg.com/" target="_new">http://www.rforsberg.com/</a>) 

<P></P>

She said Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, voted in favor of President Bush's Iraq 

war resolution in order to buttress his all- but-announced bid for the presidency 

in 2004. 

<p></p>

"It looks like the best way to run for president is to favor going to war, instead 

of preventing it," Forsberg said. 

<P></P>

A Kerry spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. 

<P></P>

Forsberg, 59, has been director of the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies, 

a non-profit think tank in Cambridge, since 1990. 

<P></P>

She alerted Kerry of her intentions on Friday and registered her write-in candidacy 

with the Secretary of State's office on Monday. 

<P></P>

An author and expert on disarmament, Forsberg advised former U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston 

of California, a nuclear arms control activist, during his unsuccessful 1984 presidential 

run. 

<P></P>

Kerry faces Libertarian Michael Cloud on the Nov. 5 ballot. His only Republican 

opponent, Anthony Kandel, failed to collect enough signatures to qualify. 

<P></P>

Kerry voted two weeks ago in favor of a congressional resolution authorizing President 

Bush to use force to disarm Iraq. He said at the time, "I believe that a deadly 

arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in (Saddam's) hands is a real and grave 

threat to our security."
