<p>The officer who commanded the British 7th Armored Brigade in the Gulf War has 

revealed that he is strongly opposed to a military invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>Maj Gen Patrick Cordingley, who commanded the brigade - the renowned Desert 

Rats - in 1991, believes that Iraq poses no imminent threat to Britain or its 

interests and that "the case for war has not yet been made by the politicians".</p>

<p>Gen Cordingley told The Telegraph: "I'm absolutely opposed to a war. I feel 

very strongly that it is wrong. There is no justification for sending British 

troops to Iraq." </p>

<p>He doubted that the dossier of evidence against the Iraqi regime - to be released 

by Tony Blair on Tuesday - would prove the case for war. "I don't think they have 

much, frankly," he said.</p>

<p>It is understood that Gen Cordingley also has grave concerns about the number 

of casualties that could result from having to fight all the way to Baghdad.</p>

<p>Based on his forecast from 1991 that military casualties in a full-scale conflict 

could amount to 15 per cent, a suggested British and American invasion force of 

250,000 troops could suffer more than 37,000 casualties. </p>

<p>In the event in 1991, the predicted battles between two large armies did not 

materialize and allied casualties numbered fewer than 250. The United States lost 

148 men and Britain 24 - nine of them to US friendly fire.</p>

<p>Gen Cordingley, 58, is the first retired senior Army officer and Gulf War veteran 

to condemn the Government's stance on a possible Iraq war.</p>

<p>The Telegraph has learnt, however, of a growing unease among senior British 

officers. One serving officer said that Britain and the US should embark on a 

war only with the sanction of the UN.</p>

<p> He said: the Army is apolitical and will do as it's told. But there is concern 

that an invasion of Iraq could totally destabilize the entire region. Saddam Hussein 

has been contained for 10 years. </p>

<p>The question being asked is, 'Why choose war now?' - especially when there's 

no proof that he's linked to al-Qa'eda.</p>

<p>"There is also growing frustration that, while the Americans appear to be making 

all sort of plans for an invasion, the British military is completely in the dark. 

Nothing has come down from the top, and we need direction."</p>

<p>Gen Cordingley has immense experience of the complex politics and culture of 

the Gulf region. </p>

<p>In 1996, he published an account of his experiences, entitled In the Eye of 

the Storm, which was based on a diary he kept throughout the conflict. In the 

epilogue, he records the sense of inevitability of war as the military build-up 

began.</p>

<p>"Once the coalition was ready to fight, the temptation for the politicians 

to find a military solution to the problem must have been overwhelming," he wrote.</p>

<p>"The political conundrum as to whether Saddam Hussein should have been removed 

from power is perhaps more difficult to comment on without reference to hindsight, 

but I remember thinking at the time that no one wanted a vacuum in the Middle 

East, nor did the Americans want to be seen as king-makers."</p>
