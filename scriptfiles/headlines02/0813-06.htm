<p>BAGHDAD — A senior Iraqi official said today that there was no need for United 

Nations weapons inspectors to return to Baghdad and branded as a "lie" the allegation 

that Saddam Hussein still had weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<P> Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, Iraq's information minister, said President Bush was lying about the country's weapons programs to drum up support for Mr. Hussein's ouster. </p>

<P> In an interview on the Arabic satellite television channel Al Jazeera, Mr. Sahhaf also said that Mr. Bush "knows that he is standing in quicksand when it comes to his baseless talk on Iraq." </p>

<P> "This is a lie," Mr. Sahhaf said of Washington's insistence that Iraq still possessed or sought to build chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. "This is an American stance."</p>

<P> The State Department responded by saying that Baghdad was not giving a straight answer on resuming inspections after a break of nearly four years.</p>

<P> "They refuse to face up to their obligations, and obfuscate and look for ways to move the goal posts when it's a simple situation," said Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman.</p>

<P> "The issue is not inspections but verified disarmament," he said. "Iraq needs to disarm."</p>

<P> Mr. Sahhaf's remarks came as many countries — including some American allies and some powerful legislators — have expressed opposition to the possibility of military action against Iraq. Baghdad has opened a campaign portraying itself as the victim of false American propaganda.</p>

<P> Mr. Sahhaf said the United Nations work concerning Iraqi weapons programs was completed. "They claim something remains," he said. "This talk can be responded to and disproved. Inspections have finished in Iraq."</p>

<P> A report by the United Nations inspection agency issued in January 1999 — 

a month after inspectors were withdrawn — mentioned priority issues that Iraq 

had not satisfactorily resolved. Those included its development of VX, a deadly 

chemical weapons nerve agent; its missile production abilities; and many remaining 

question marks about its biological weapons program.</p>
