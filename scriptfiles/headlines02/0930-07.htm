<p>SILVER SPRING, Maryland - Every United States coral reef system is suffering 

from both human and natural disturbances, warns a new report from the National 

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 

<p>The first national assessment of the condition of U.S. coral reefs links development, 

pollution and destructive fishing practices with the decline of reefs in U.S. 

waters and around the globe. 

<p>The 265 page report, "<a href="http://www.coralreef.noaa.gov/" target="_new">The 

State of Coral Reef Ecosystems of the United States and Pacific Freely Associated 

States</a>," identifies the pressures that pose increasing risks to the nation's 

estimated 7,607 square miles of coral reefs, particularly in hot spots located 

near population centers. The report also assesses the health of reef resources, 

ranks threats in 13 geographic areas, and details ongoing efforts to mitigate 

damage to coral reefs. 

<p>Craig Manson, the Interior Department's assistant secretary for fish and wildlife 

and parks, called the study "an important first report card on the health of U.S. 

reefs. It's a valuable tool for raising public awareness about the global decline 

of these unique treasures." 

<p>Raising public awareness and stimulating official action on coral reefs is 

crucial, the report's authors say, because an estimated 27 percent of the world's 

shallow water coral reefs may already be beyond recovery. An estimated 66 percent 

are now considered to be severely degraded. 

<p>Thirty-eight coral reef experts and 79 expert contributors collaborated on 

the report, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) 

Ocean Service. They found that while some U.S. reefs are in good to excellent 

health, all are already at risk from human activities. 

<p>U.S. reefs share problems with reefs around the world, particularly the effects 

of growing coastal populations. More than 10.5 million people now live in U.S. 

coastal areas adjacent to shallow water coral reefs, and every year, some 45 million 

people visit these areas. 

<p>Natural environmental pressures such as temperature, sea level changes, diseases 

and storms have shaped coral reefs for thousands of years, but human induced pressures 

are now forcing rapid changes on reef ecosystems. Coastal pollution, coastal development 

and runoff, and destructive fishing practices are among the top ranked threats 

to reefs. 

<p>Other risks come from ship groundings, diseases, changing climate, trade in 

coral and live reef species, alien species, marine debris, harmful tourist activity 

and tropical storms. Coral reefs - Earth's largest biological structures - are 

an essential source of food, jobs, chemicals, shoreline protection and pharmaceuticals 

for the United States. Tourism in U.S. coral reef areas generates more than &#36;17 

billion a year, while commercial fishing generates an additional &#36;246.9 million. 

<p>In South Florida alone, where many reefs are damaged or dying, reefs now support 

44,500 jobs, providing a total annual income of &#36;1.2 billion. Live coral cover 

in the Florida Keys has declined by 37 percent over the past five years. 

<p>The NOAA report shows that reefs along Florida and the U.S. Caribbean are in 

the poorest condition of all U.S. corals, because of nearby dense populations 

and the effects of hurricanes, disease, overfishing and a proliferation of algae. 

Of 31 coral reef fishery stocks in federal waters, 23 are overfished in the U.S. 

Caribbean. 

<p>Coral disease is also a major problem in the Caribbean, where more than 90 

percent of the once abundant longspine sea urchins died in the early 1980s. These 

urchins, which keep coral from being overgrown and killed by algae, have since 

recovered to just 10 percent of their original numbers off the coasts of Florida, 

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

<p> In the past 20 years, white-band disease has killed almost all the elkhorn 

and staghorn corals off the coasts of St. Croix, Puerto Rico and southeast Florida. 

<p> The report also details coral reef conditions in the Flower Garden Banks of 

the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, Nassau, the Hawaiian Archipelago, American Samoa, 

Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana islands and the Pacific Freely 

Associated States, which include the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated 

States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau. 

<p> Prepared under the guidance of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, the report 

is intended to establish a baseline that can be used for biennial reports on the 

health of U.S. coral reefs. The task force was established in 1998 to help lead 

U.S. efforts to address threats to coral reefs. 

<p> Co-chaired by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, it includes the 

heads of 11 federal agencies and governors of seven states, territories and commonwealths. 

<p> Among the initiatives spearheaded by the Task Force, and detailed in the new 

report, is an innovative mapping project used to explore coral reefs around Puerto 

Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The project used a new, 26 category classification 

system to examine the environmental health and biological diversity of the reefs. 

<p> "The new classification is a vital management tool that tells us where the 

reefs are, what lives on them, and what relationships may be to neighboring habitats 

and human activities," said NOAA Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher. "We now have 

a complete snapshot of the U.S. Caribbean region, a clear, consistent baseline 

for future mapping, and a solid model to implement good management in other regions." 

<p> The mapping process developed in the Caribbean is now being applied in Hawaii, 

and future projects will map reefs in Guam, American Samoa and other U.S. territories 

with coral reefs. 

<p> Data and other information derived from NOAA's coral reef efforts are now 

available at CoRIS, a new Coral Reef Information System website that provides 

a single point of access for almost 20,000 aerial photos, navigational charts, 

photo mosaics, monitoring reports, professional exchanges and more. 

<p> One of the highlights of the website is NOAA's report to Congress on "A National 

Coral Reef Strategy," outlining 13 major goals, including continuing mapping and 

monitoring, intended to safeguard reefs. 

<p> The strategy and the report on U.S. coral reef status will be referenced this 

week when the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force holds its annual meeting in San Juan, 

Puerto Rico.
