            <p>GEORGE Bush was about to be hoist by his own petard. It was Monday 

              last week, and the president was glad-handing with the great and 

              the good at the Cincinnati Museum Center in Ohio as he waited to 

              give one of his most bellicose speeches yet.

            <p>In the audience were Ohio state governor Bob Taft and a host of 

              business and political luminaries. As the deadline approached for 

              the Senate and House of Representatives vote on whether or not to 

              give Bush the backing he wanted to attack Iraq, this speech was 

              to be the president's final flourish in the propaganda war to get 

              the US marching in line behind him.

            <p>Calling Saddam Hussein a 'murderous tyrant', he made it clear why 

              America had to finish off the Iraqi dictator. 'Facing clear evidence 

              of peril,' he told the audience, 'we cannot wait for the final proof 

              -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom 

              cloud.' He went on: 'We have every reason to assume the worst and 

              we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from happening.'

            <p>What Bush could not have guessed was that his claims that Iraq 

              was intent on attacking the USA had already began to unravel. The 

              denouement started a few days before, on Thursday, October 3, when 

              Senator Bob Graham, chair of the Senate intelligence committee, 

              metaphorically donned his hob-nailed boots and began delivering 

              some well-aimed kicks to the head of George Tenet, the director 

              of the CIA. The CIA, Graham said, were monkeying with democracy. 

              The agency was not telling his committee what they needed to know 

              about the Iraqi regime. Tenet was damaging the ability of Congress 

              to assess the need for military action.

            <p>With one week until Congress voted on authorizing Bush to use force, 

              Graham was impatient. These are serious times, he said , and he 

              needed serious answers. Graham and the committee had received an 

              anodyne intelligence report from the CIA on the threat posed by 

              Iraq the day before -- Wednesday, October 2. This, however, answered 

              none of the questions the Senate committee wanted answered: would 

              Saddam use weapons of mass destruction (WMD); how would his regime 

              react if attacked; and what would be the consequences of war?

            <p>On October 9, almost a week after Tenet received his whipping at 

              the hands of Graham, the senator's hardman approach paid off when 

              the director of the CIA admitted that the only reason Saddam would 

              use WMDs against the United States was if he was backed into a corner 

              -- due to a strike by the American military -- and realized he was 

              about to fall. Saddam, Tenet was saying, would only become the nightmare 

              that Bush envisaged, if Bush attacked him first. Within two days, 

              then, of Bush's flag-waving call to arms, his most senior intelligence 

              officer had pulled the rug from under the biggest project of his 

              presidency.

            <p>Tenet's admission left Bush in disarray with revelations making 

              it appear as if the president was exaggerating the threat from Iraq, 

              to say the least. Tenet, a loyal subject of the Bush administration, 

              had no option but to come clean -- no matter how difficult a position 

              it put the president in. 

            <p>The CIA director's hands were tied on October 3 by Senator Graham, 

              a democrat who represents Florida, when he told the CIA it was acting 

              'unacceptably', and added: 'We're trying to carry out a very important 

              responsibility, and given the nature of this classified information, 

              we are the only means by which the intelligence community can communicate 

              to the legislative branch of government.'

            <p>There was no way that Tenet could play fast and loose with the 

              Senate. Both the FBI and CIA have been attacked repeatedly in Congressional 

              hearings since September 11 for a series of intelligence cock-ups.

            <p>Later on October 3, after Graham met with Tenet, his mood had changed 

              -- Graham seemed to be cooler, calmer. He said the meeting had been 

              frank and candid. What Graham wanted was a flavor of the classified 

              National Intelligence Estimates, prepared by the National Intelligence 

              Council, whose analysts report directly to Tenet. On Monday, October 

              7, around the time Bush was in Ohio cheerleading for war , Graham 

              received just what he had been looking for -- it came in the shape 

              of a letter from the CIA director. It made astonishing reading. 

              Two days later, on Wednesday, October 9, the Senate intelligence 

              committee voted to make the full text of Tenet's letter public.

            <p>

            <p>Tenet's letter said he was declassifying selected material to help 

              the Senate's deliberations on whether or not to support the president 

              over attacking Iraq. 'Baghdad, for now, appears to be drawing a 

              line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or 

              CBW (chemical and biological weapons) against the United States,' 

              the declassified material read.

            <p>'Should Saddam conclude that a US-led attack could no longer be 

              deterred, he probably would become much less constrained in adopting 

              terrorist actions. Such terrorism might involve conventional means 

              ... or CBW.

            <p>'Saddam might decide that the extreme step of assisting Islamist 

              terrorists in conducting a WMD attack against the US would be his 

              last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims 

              with him.'

            <p>Tenet went on to declassify formerly secret evidence given at a 

              closed hearing of the Senate's intelligence committee in which democrat 

              Carl Levin, was told by a 'senior intelligence witness' that the 

              'probability ... would be low' of Saddam initiating a WMD attack. 

              The agent also said the chances were 'pretty high' that Saddam would 

              launch a WMD attack 'if we initiate an attack and he thought he 

              was in extremis'. Tenet's revelations left the entire basis of Bush's 

              call to arms in ruins, and the CIA director swiftly became an embarrassment 

              to the president as the propaganda war backfired . Tenet was not 

              deliberately trying to undermine Bush -- he was simply forced into 

              a corner by the Senate and compelled to reveal his true understanding 

              of the Iraqi crisis.

            <p>Kenneth M Pollack, who worked as a military analyst at the CIA 

              before serving as a top aide on Persian Gulf affairs on President 

              Clinton's National Security Council, said: 'The agency line is that 

              it is basically unlikely that Iraq would give WMDs to terrorists 

              under most circumstances. The Bush administration is trying to make 

              the case that Iraq might try to give WMDs to al-Qaeda under certain 

              circumstances. But what the agency is saying is that Saddam is likely 

              to give such weapons to terrorists only under extreme circumstances 

              when he believes he is likely to be toppled.'

            <p>The White House tried to put a different spin on the Tenet letter. 

              Sean McCormack, the White House National Security Council spokesman, 

              said the portions of the letter released by Graham gave a misleading 

              impression of the CIA's overall conclusion. 'There were parts of 

              the Tenet letter that weren't read in,' he said. Other parts were 

              'taken out of context', he said. However, Graham's spokesman, Paul 

              Anderson, denied there had been any misquoting, and the full document, 

              which the Senate committee has released, supports Anderson's line.

            <p>Lee Hamilton, the former chairman of the House of Representatives 

              Intelligence Committee, added pointedly: 'It's an overwhelming temptation 

              to manipulate intelligence to serve policy and, to some extent, 

              I think that's what's happening here with Iraq.'

            <p>Tenet did, however, leave the Bush conspiracists something to cling 

              to. In his letter to Graham, he played up the alleged links between 

              al-Qaeda and Iraq, saying: 'We have solid reporting of senior level 

              contacts between Iraq and al-Qaeda going back a decade. 

            <p>Credible information indicates that Iraq and al-Qaeda have discussed 

              safe haven and reciprocal non-aggression ... we have solid evidence 

              of the presence in Iraq of al-Qaeda members ... we have credible 

              reporting that al-Qaeda leaders sought contacts in Iraq, who could 

              help them acquire WMD capabilities ... Iraq has provided training 

              to al-Qaeda members in areas of poisons and gases and making conventional 

              bombs.'

            <p>

            <p>This was not a smoking gun, but it kept suspicions alive that Iraq 

              might just pass terrorists WMDs any day now. Tenet's tentative connection 

              between Iraq and al-Qaeda is a far cry from the findings of his 

              counterparts in Europe. Try as it might, the UK has been unable 

              to produce any evidence clearly linking Saddam to bin Laden, and 

              the French have positively ruled out any connection. Jean-Louis 

              Brugui&#143;re, France's leading terrorist investigator, says years 

              of investigation into radical Islamic terror groups have not produced 

              a trace of evidence linking them to Iraq.

            <p>Brugui&#143;re is an investigative magistrate empowered to view 

              French domestic and foreign intelligence material. Much of the material 

              he sees is passed on to the CIA and FBI by French intelligence. 

              He says: 'We have not found any link between al-Qaeda and Iraq. 

              Not a trace. There is no foundation to our investigations for the 

              information given by the Americans.'

            <p>The French believe the secular nature of Saddam's regime deters 

              him from getting into bed with the likes of bin Laden. It also makes 

              cozying up to Saddam an anathema to the fundamentalists of al-Qaeda. 

              Despite the admissions in the Tenet letter, the Senate voted 77-23 

              in the early hours of last Friday morning to authorize Bush to use 

              force against Iraq. Earlier, the House of Representatives had voted 

              the same way by a margin of 296-133.

            <p>It seems that most of the Senate listened to the US Defense Secretary 

              Donald Rumsfeld's reply to claims that the White House was exaggerating 

              the Iraqi threat. 

            <p>'Each of us has a solemn responsibility,' he said, 'to do everything 

              in our power to ensure that, when the history of this period is 

              written, the books won't ask why we slept.'

            <p>The doubts of the intelligence community were washed away against 

              such patriotic phrase-making. It should be noted, however, that 

              a few senators listened to Tenet's admissions and voted 'no'. Among 

              them was Senator Bob Graham.
