Street protests against Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right pitted against conservative President Jacques Chirac in May 5 elections, snowballed into violent demonstrations.

</font>From the first hours after first-round elections on Sunday that knocked out the top left-wing favorite, Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and 13 other candidates anti-Le Pen opposition has gathered force, and is becoming organized.

<p>More than 10,000 people vented their rage at the results in Paris demonstrations Sunday and Monday night at the Place de la Bastille, Place de la Republique and Place de la Concorde -- traditional rallying points since the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Each time, police were forced to fire tear-gas grenades to disperse the crowds after a small hard core of militants clashed with them.</p>

<p>Some, overnight Monday, threw Molotov cocktails, firebombs made from bottles filled with petrol. Others broke windows and telephone cabins and damaged parked vehicles. Thirteen police were slightly injured and 14 youths were arrested.</p>

<p>In the rest of France, similar disturbances have erupted without warning.</p>

<p>On Monday, a total 100,000 people marched through Lyon, Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux and other towns and cities.</p>

<p>Most were started by high school and university students, who streamed out of classes to parade past startled police. They soon gathered force as others stepped into line.</p>

<p>In Tours, star anti-globalization militant Jose Bove marched at the head of a 12,000-strong crowd that included his supporters who have rejected Le Pen, despite his promises to erect protectionist trade barriers around France.</p>

<p>More militant protests were swelling early Tuesday in the towns of Le Havre, Rouen, and even in the southern Le Pen stronghold of Toulon.</p>

<p>A climax will come on May 1, a public holiday, when all the protesters will be urged to drown a counter rally Le Pen has called in central Paris for his final electoral push.</p>

<p>Many of the younger protesters were organizing themselves through e-mailings and via their cellphones, particularly using rapid-fire text messages to give places and times and to outfox police lines, he said.</p>

<p>The violence that has accompanied some of the demonstrations was "worrying, but nothing new in France," he said. </p>
