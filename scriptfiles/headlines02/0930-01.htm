<p> The EU is ready to agree a deal with the US giving American citizens a degree 

of immunity from prosecution by the new International Criminal Court, having been 

persuaded by Britain to step back from its hardline opposition to prevent a transatlantic 

row. 

<P>Its foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels today, are expected to set out the 

conditions in which separate immunity arrangements can be concluded for Americans. 

<P>Human rights groups and the Council of Europe urged the EU not to take this 

step. 

<P>The court, which is due to begin work in the Hague next year, was created as 

a permanent institution to try individuals for genocide, war crimes and other 

human rights abuses. 

<P>Washington has refused to back the court, fearing its people could become targets 

for politically motivated charges. It is far from clear whether it will find the 

new EU position acceptable. 

<P>"This is as far as we can go," a Brussels diplomat said last night. 

<P>The row about the court has added to the strain caused by Iraq and trade disputes, 

and underlined the gap between American unilateralism and the EU's multilateral 

approach to international issues. 

<P>It has also shown how hard it is to square EU aspirations for a common foreign 

and security policy with the reality that member states often differ on fundamental 

issues. 

<P>Under the compromise, individual EU members may sign immunity agreements with 

the US but must respect the ICC statute. 

<P>The US will have to guarantee that there would be no impunity for crimes by 

promising that Americans accused of abuses will be tried in their own country. 

It will also have to drop its demand for blanket exemptions.

of slavishly torpedoing a united EU position.
