<p>WASHINGTON - Accusing the Bush administration of a "cozy, permissive relationship" 

with corporate America, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said on Sunday the 

chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission was largely responsible and 

should be replaced. 

<p>

Daschle faulted Chairman Harvey Pitt for having "too cozy a relationship" with 

those his agency regulates, including meeting with accountants he used to represent 

"on many occasions before issuing regulation." 

<p>

Asked on CBS' "Face the Nation" if he thought Pitt should

leave the SEC, the top U.S. markets regulator, Daschle said,

"That is an issue that I think we are going to want to explore

a little more carefully."

<p>

"I have to say that at this point, we could do a lot better

than Harvey Pitt in that position today. That cozy permissive

relationship has to end and he in large measure has

orchestrated that over the last 18 months."

<p> In Kennebunkport, Maine, where President Bush was on a long Fourth of July 

weekend, White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said Bush had total confidence 

in Pitt and rejected Daschle's charges. 

<p>

"The SEC under Harvey Pitt is doing a great job of taking

steps to increase disclosure and increase the level of

information that is available to shareholders and potential

shareholders," she said.

<p>

"And the SEC has stepped up enforcement and has a very

strong record of getting tough on corporate wrongdoing," she

said, adding that Bush wanted the Senate to approve his

proposal for giving the SEC administrative authority to punish

corporate officers involved in wrongdoing.

<p>

In the wake of WorldCom Inc.'s announcement of a &#36;3.85

billion accounting error following last year's spectacular

collapse of Enron Corp. and other corporate debacles, Daschle

said greater regulation was needed and Pitt instead was

overseeing "a kinder and gentler SEC, just the opposite of what

we should have had."

<p>

"He has been a huge disappointment," Daschle said.

<p>

Though many of the actions took place before he became

chairman last August, Pitt, a former Wall Street lawyer with

prominent clients that included the major accounting firms, has

faced criticism. Daschle last week said Pitt, a Republican

appointment under Bush, had "a perception problem" and needed

to prove his independence.

<p>

Pitt told CNN last week that he would "not stoop to the

level of those who seek to attack a diligent agency for

political advantage."

<p>

HARVEY'S WATCH

<p>

Rep. Michael Oxley, whose U.S. House of Representatives

Financial Services Committee opens a hearing on Monday on the

WorldCom case, also defended Pitt. "This just didn't start on

Harvey Pitt's watch," Oxley told "Fox News Sunday." "I have

nothing but faith in Harvey's abilities, his integrity."

<p>

Daschle spoke before Bush was to unveil a crackdown on

corporate misconduct in an address on Wall Street on Tuesday,

and said others in the administration were also to blame for

the permissive attitude that has allowed corporate earnings

scandals to happen.

<p>

"There has been too much of a permissive attitude ... all

the way through," he said. "We've seen this from top to bottom.

We've even seen that in relationships that some of the members

of the administration have had with their own corporate roles,

and the responsibilities they had in the corporate sector."

<p> The SEC has launched an investigation of Halliburton Co., the company Vice 

President Dick Cheney ran from 1995 to 2000. 

<p>

Daschle also called on Bush to release SEC information

regarding his sale of stock while a director of Texas-based

Harken Energy Corp. . The SEC investigated Bush in 1991 for

being up to 34 weeks late in reporting stock sales worth more

than &#36;1 million but concluded he did not engage in illegal

insider trading. Bush's father was president at the time.

<p>

"The president would do well to ask the SEC to release the

file -- release it all. Let everyone see just what is there,"

Daschle said. "There have been some real questions I think

about what happened."

<p>

The White House blamed a "mix-up" by company lawyers for

Bush's failure to comply with the stock sale disclosure rules

more than a decade ago.

<p>

The South Dakota Democrat said Bush's comparing what he had

done to driving 60 mph in a 55 mph zone was "illustrative of

this permissive environment and this attitude about business

that is very destructive and very disconcerting to many of us."

<p>

"That is the kind of thing that got us into the trouble in

the first place, winking at regulation," he said.
