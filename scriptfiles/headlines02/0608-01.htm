<p>ITALIAN police are bracing today for demonstrations by anti-globalization protesters on the eve of the World Food Summit which begins in Rome on Monday. 

<P>The Italian authorities, fearing a repeat of the mayhem at the G8 summit in Genoa a year ago, have blocked off the streets around the headquarters of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) where the summit is being held. 

<P>They have also mobilized more than 5,000 police and troops both for the four-day summit and for an anti-globalization march today through the center of Rome which is expected to draw more than 50,000 protesters. 

<P>Officials said that the security measures had been prompted not only by memories of the Genoa riots, in which one demonstrator was killed, but also by the “heightened tensions” the September 11 attacks. Silvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister, had initially sought to have the summit postponed or moved to a more remote venue. 

<P>Today’s march will be led by José Bové, the French anti-globalization militant who was arrested in France for attempting to destroy a McDonald’s outlet. 

<P>The summit is likely to be dominated not only by disputes between the West and the Third World over global hunger and poverty but also by US-European tensions over genetically modified foodstuffs. The meeting is a follow-up to the first UN food summit held five years ago, which set a target of halving world hunger by 2015. 

<P>FAO officials said that, while Genoa was seen as confrontation between the “rich and powerful” G8 nations and campaigners for the world’s poor and dispossessed, the FAO itself agreed with the protesters that the world was “failing to feed the hungry even though it produces more food than it needs”. 

<P>“Basically we are on the same side” said Nick Parsons, the FAO spokesman. “We are all concerned about how to feed 800 million hungry people”.</P>
