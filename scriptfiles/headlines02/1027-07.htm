<p>Tens of thousands of people marched in peaceful protest of any military strike 

against Iraq yesterday afternoon, in an antiwar demonstration that organizers 

and police suggested was likely Washington's largest since the Vietnam era.</p>

</font></font>Organizers with International ANSWER, a coalition of antiwar groups 

that coordinated the demonstration, had hoped for a turnout rivaling that of its 

pro-Palestinian rally in April that officials estimated at about 75,000. Organizers 

said they easily eclipsed that figure yesterday, assessing attendance at well 

more than 100,000. D.C. Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey also said he figured yesterday's 

rally turnout exceeded that in April, but he didn't provide a specific number.</p> 

<p> "We think this was just extremely, extremely successful," said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, 

a D.C. organizer with International ANSWER, Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. 

"It absolutely shows that when George Bush says America speaks with one voice, 

and it's his voice, he's wrong."</p>

<p> After a rally that lasted more than three hours at Constitution Gardens, near 

the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the march began at 21st Street and Constitution 

Avenue. Using 17th, H, 15th and E streets NW, protesters circled the White House 

and returned to their starting point. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds filled the streets 

for several blocks. When marchers at the front of the procession returned to Constitution 

Avenue on their way back, they had to wait to allow demonstrators at the tail 

of the march to pass.</p>

<p> Demonstrations in other cities, including Rome, Berlin, Copenhagen, Denmark, 

Tokyo and Mexico City, were held to coincide with the Washington march, and in 

San Francisco, thousands marched through downtown.</p>

<p> Protesters arrived by the busload, by car and by Metro early yesterday morning, 

some carrying signs and later joining in chants that echoed a common theme: A 

war against Iraq would be unjustified, and there is no consensus for it.</p>

<p> "Nebraskans for Peace" and "Hoosiers for Non-Violence" chanted alongside silver-coiffed 

retirees from Chicago and a Muslim student association from Michigan. Parents 

could be seen enjoying a sunny, picnic-perfect afternoon by pushing a stroller 

with one hand and carrying a "No War for Oil" sign with the other. Police on horseback 

monitored nearby.</p>

</font></font>The tone of the rally was far different from the District's last 

major protest -- the September demonstrations during the annual meetings of the 

International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. During those events, anti-globalization 

protesters had intended to paralyze the city with disruptive throngs, but their 

numbers were much smaller than expected, and they were dominated by a massive 

police presence. More than 600 people were arrested during the IMF and World Bank 

protests; yesterday, police reported three arrests.</p> 

<p> Several groups, including the Anti-Capitalist Convergence that organized one 

of September's protests, mounted an independent march that fed into yesterday's 

rally and said everyone had agreed upon a non-confrontational goal from the outset.</p>

<p> "I don't think police want problems, and I don't think we want problems either," 

said Pat Elder, 47, a Bethesda antiwar activist who participated in the unpermitted 

feeder march.</p>

<p> The morning began under hazy skies on the wet grass at Constitution Gardens, 

as thick mud sucked at the heels of the arriving demonstrators and the nearby 

Washington Monument appeared truncated by fog. But by noon the skies cleared and 

most of the lawn was shoulder-to-shoulder with people listening to Jesse Jackson, 

actress Susan Sarandon, singer Patti Smith and former Attorney General Ramsey 

Clark, among other speakers.</p>

<p> Several speakers referred to Vietnam era protests, and organizers were eager 

to compare the current movement with the one that peaked with a rally of between 

250,000 and 500,000 people in Washington in 1969. The last large-scale peace protest 

in Washington was in 1991, when about 75,000 demonstrated during the height of 

the Persian Gulf War.</p>

<p> Unlike those protests, yesterday's rally was different in that it preceded 

war, and many interpreted that as an indication of a potentially powerful movement.</p>

<p> "During the Vietnam War, no demonstration of comparable size took place until 

1967, three years after the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution [that gave President Lyndon 

B. Johnson congressional authority to expand the war in Vietnam]," said Brian 

Becker, co-director of the International Action Center, one of the groups that 

make up International ANSWER.</p>

<p> But if the passions of the Vietnam era led to protests that often trembled 

on the edge between control and chaos, yesterday's event suggested that this movement 

is burning at a lower flame.</p>

<p> "Here I'm not being spit on, people aren't throwing tomatoes at me and Joan 

Baez isn't singing," said protest veteran Dot Magargal, 77, from Media, Pa. "People 

just want to come out and say that not everyone wants to go to war. This is a 

lot of people, a lot of voters, and it has to count for something."</p>

<p> For those looking for symbols often associated with left-wing demonstrations 

-- Grateful Dead T-shirts, dreadlocks, anti-corporate slogans, Socialist newsletters 

-- plenty could be found. But it wasn't necessary to comb through the fringe to 

find people who didn't fit the mold. Many said they were first-time protesters 

who had never attended a rally. Some said they were against all war, no matter 

the circumstances, and others said they were simply against the possibility of 

an Iraq invasion.</p>

<p> "I've never in my life done anything like this before," said Marie Johnson, 

31, of Columbia. "What I wanted to do was say that even though Bush puts forth 

that everyone supports going to war against Iraq, some of us don't. I just thought 

it was important for me to do something to show how I felt."</p>

<p> Peggy McGrath, 59, said she hoped that Bush would look out of the windows 

of the White House to see that thousands disagreed with him. She said she remained 

optimistic that he might change his mind, especially if enough people voiced opposition.</p>

<p> "I think there's actually been a shift already in Bush's rhetoric in the last 

two weeks," said McGrath, who was on one in a caravan of eight buses from Chicago. 

"The hope is that maybe he'll see this, and maybe it can be stopped before it's 

started."</p>

<p> Bush, however, wasn't at the White House. He and first lady Laura Bush flew 

yesterday from their Texas ranch to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where the president 

was attending the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Among other things, 

Bush was seeking to rally fellow leaders behind his Iraq stance.</p>

<p> The president had some support at the rally from a group of about 100 counter-protesters 

who gathered at 17th Street and Constitution Avenue. Along with activists from 

the national group Free Republic, a group of Iraqi exiles chanted slogans against 

Saddam Hussein. In one of the few points of tension during the day, police stepped 

into a scuffle between peace activists and counter-protesters and led away two 

of the former.</p>

<p> One who joined the counter-protesters, Imam Husham Al-Husainy, explained that 

he came to Washington from the Detroit area with about 40 Iraqis to present the 

view of people who had suffered under Hussein.</p>

<p> "Most of these people across the street, they don't know the reality in Iraq," 

Al-Husainy said.</p>

<p> Although the main protest message was focused on opposing war in Iraq, a few 

other causes slipped into the mix. Many of the same people who marched for Palestinian 

rights in April joined yesterday's march, waving Palestinian flags. But like others 

who had become activists for other causes, they said opposing the war was what 

brought them out yesterday.</p>

<p> "I don't come here to carry signs for fun," said Ribhi Ramadan, 36, who brought 

his family of seven from Paterson, N.J., to the protest. "I support not just Palestine, 

but everywhere that's threatened by war."</p>

<p> Luigi Procopio, 45, a social worker from the district, wore a pink triangle 

with "$ FOR AIDS NOT WAR" written on it. He said even though he normally focuses 

his activism on issues in the gay community, he and at least a dozen friends came 

to protest the war in Iraq.</p>

<p> "It's time, man. . . . It feels imminent," he said. "Congress has just rolled 

over."</p>

<p> Some protesters said they had been worried about attendance before they arrived 

at the rally. Larina Brown, 22, a student from the University of Minnesota-Morris, 

said she had feared that she and the 30 friends she traveled with would be greeted 

by scant crowds.</p>

<p> "It's a relief, really," Brown said. "I really wanted this to be a big statement, 

to show it's not just radical, anti-American people who go to these things."</p>

<p> Most of those who arrived in the morning on buses climbed back aboard shortly 

after the rally ended. By 5:45 p.m., the streets were almost deserted, and protesters 

had put down their signs and were sitting on park benches snacking.</p>

<p> Mark Zheng, 33, of Amherst, Mass., stopped to take a photo of two friends 

in front of a fountain in Lafayette Square. Zheng, from China, had been at the 

Tiananmen Square protests. He said he was impressed by the orderliness of the 

march.</p>

<p> "I think maybe people have different thoughts on things, but one thing is 

clear," he said. "Peace."</p>
