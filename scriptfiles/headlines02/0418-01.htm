The devastation of Jenin refugee camp, invaded by the Israel army, is "horrific 

beyond belief," UN special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen lamented.

<p>"It is totally destroyed, it looks like an earthquake has hit it," said Roed-Larsen, 

visiting the northern West Bank camp with Red Cross and UN workers.</p>

<p>"It is totally unacceptable and horrific beyond belief," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"It is totally unacceptable that the government of Israel for 11 days did not 

allow search and rescue teams to come. This is morally repugnant," said Roed-Larsen, 

the UN Sepecial Coordiator for the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>Israel declared the camp -- which it said was a hotbed of Palestinian militancy 

-- a closed military zone when it invaded on April 3, and refused to allow aid 

groups or media in afterwards, except for in small groups accompanied by the army.</p>

<p>It said that unexploded bombs and booby traps made it too dangerous to allow 

anyone in.</p>

<p>Larsen denounced that argument, saying Israel could have allowed in international 

experts to help clear the area and search for possible survivors trapped in the 

rubble.</p>

<p>"That is no excuse," he said.</p>

<p>"I am watching two brothers pull their father from the ruins, the stench of 

death is horrible. We're seeing a 12-year-old boy being dug out, totally burned.</p>

<p>"We have expert people here who have been in war zones and earthquake and they 

say they have never seen anything like it," he said.</p>

<p>Larsen said the top priority was to bring in search-and-rescue teams which 

he said were already on the way but had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>The only rescue efforts currently underway were local residents digging though 

the ruins of their homes and looking for survivors. </p>

<p>Larsen said such efforts jeopardised the safety of the desperate diggers, working 

close to buildings that were in danger of collapse.</p>

<p>He said his organisation would try to find out exactly what happened in the 

week-long fight in the camp, as the Israeli army moved in to hunt down Palestinian 

militant groups.</p>

<p>The Palestinians call the army operation a "massacre" which killed hundreds 

of people, some of them allegedly executed after surrendering.</p>

<p>Israel says that dozens rather than hundreds of Palestinians died, pointing 

to the fact that its army lost 23 soldiers -- 14 in one day -- as evidence that 

the camp was the scene of heavy house-to-house fighting which took its toll on 

both the Palestinians and its own forces.</p>
