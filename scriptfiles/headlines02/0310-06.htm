ROME (AFP) &#151; Tens of thousands of

        people marched in Rome on Saturday to call for the

        creation of a Palestinian state and express solidarity

        with the Palestinian people.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators, most of them young people, marched through the Italian capital on Saturday in a noisy, peaceful show of support for Palestinians in their battle with Israel.

</font>The protest &#151;

        organized by the Democratic Left, the Green party  and anti-globalization groups &#151;

        brought traffic in central Rome to a standstill, as

        demonstrators marched in intermittent rain. 

<p>Organizers said some 50,000 people participated in the

        three-kilometer march along the Italian capital's main

        thoroughfares. </p>

        <p>The demonstration ended at the Piazza Navona, where

        speakers called for peace in the Middle East and an end

        to the bloodshed, a day after the deadliest day in the

        17-month conflict, which left more than 50 Palestinians

        dead. </p>

        <p>Many protesters &#151; among them women wearing

        Islamic headscarves &#151; said they believed Israelis

        and Palestinians could live together in peace. </p>

        <p>Demonstrators said they supported both the security of

        the state of Israel, and the creation of a Palestinian

        state. </p>

        

<p>Police were out in force to maintain order &#151;

        ahead of a Lazio-AS Roma football match set for today

        &#151; but no incidents were reported.</p>
