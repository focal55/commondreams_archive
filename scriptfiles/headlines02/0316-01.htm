PARIS (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah has warned the  United States against attacking Iraq, saying the stability of  the Middle East cannot withstand such a war while the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict is also raging.

<P>

							In an interview published on Saturday as Vice President  Dick Cheney toured the region to drum up Arab support for the  U.S.-led war on terrorism, Abdullah urged the West to give Iraq  a new chance of talks. That should be coupled with pressure on  Israel and the Palestinians to halt their conflict, he said.

<P>

							"I have told him (Cheney) that the Middle East cannot  support two wars at the same time -- the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict and an American intervention against Iraq," Abdullah,  who met Cheney on March 12, told Le Figaro newspaper.

<P>

							"To attack Baghdad now would be a disaster. The security  and stability of our region would not be able to cope with it."

<P>

							Cheney visited Jordan as his first stop in an 11-nation  trip to Middle Eastern countries, as speculation grew that the  United States is preparing to attack Iraq.

<P>

							Secretary of State Colin Powell told French television on  Friday however there were no plans to attack either Iraq or  Iran, which along with North Korea have been named by President  Bush as forming an "axis of evil" because of their efforts to  develop weapons of mass destruction.

<P>

							Cheney was due on Saturday to meet Saudi Arabia's Crown  Prince Abdullah, who has joined a chorus of Arab opposition to  the idea of U.S. strikes on Iraq while floating a peace plan  for the Arab-Israeli conflict which has been welcomed by  Washington.

<P>

							Jordan's Abdullah said failing to resolve both problems  peacefully would inflame the regional crises which had drawn  recruits to Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born militant blamed by  Washington for orchestrating the September 11 attacks.

<P>

							"To win the battle against the extremists, we have to  finish with conflicts which justify bin Laden's propaganda," he  told the French newspaper.

<P>

							"If we do nothing to solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem,  if we add an expedition against Iraq on top of the conflicts in  Palestine and Gaza, we are shooting ourselves in the foot. The  West would simply be detested even more," he added.

<P>

							Abdullah has generally strong relations with the United  States, but faces domestic pressure from a public alarmed at  the Israeli crackdown against Palestinians and wary of an  assault on neighboring Iraq. Jordan is one of four countries  bordering Iraq which are part of Cheney's Middle East tour.

<P>

							The United States has said it is determined to prevent Iraq  acquiring or using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and  is demanding unconditional international arms inspections.

<P>

							U.S. Middle East envoy Anthony Zinni held a first round of  talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Friday and said  the meetings with both sides had been "positive" in the wake of  some of the bloodiest Arab-Israeli fighting in decades.
