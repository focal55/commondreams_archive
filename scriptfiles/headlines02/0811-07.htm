<p> WASHINGTON - It could cost billions of dollars to defeat and then rebuild Iraq. An invasion could subject US soldiers to biological and chemical weapons. Oil prices could surge. US allies in the Muslim world could face turmoil.

<P>



   A campaign to force President Saddam Hussein from power could have enormous costs for the United States and the rest of the world, analysts say. US policymakers are trying to decide  whether the danger of the Iraqi dictator remaining in power outweighs the risks of trying to topple him.

<P>



   ''Even if you think we need to get rid of Saddam, and you'd like to do it, there are a lot of hard questions that need to be answered,'' said Morton Halperin, a State Department official in the Clinton administration.

<P>



   The White House has been considering those questions for months and will continue to do so. ''I have no timetable for any of our policies in regard to Iraq,''President Bush said yesterday.

<P>



   Congress is only beginning to explore the questions. Just before Congress began its August recess, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held two days of hearings, listening to analysts' opinions on the consequences of an invasion.

<P>



   More House and Senate hearings are planned after the break.

<P>



   Many lawmakers support Bush's call for Hussein's removal. He is widely believed to be developing chemical and biological weapons and pursuing nuclear weapons. The Bush administration fears he could use those weapons himself or share them with terrorists.

<P>



   Analysts are divided about how much resistance the Iraqi military could put up. It is weaker than it was during 1991 Persian Gulf War, but still is a significant force, with 350,000 to 400,000 troops.

<P>



   In a televised speech Thursday, Hussein warned that anyone who attacks Iraq ''will carry their coffins on their backs to die in disgraceful failure.''

<P>



   Many Iraq-watchers expect that US forces would face a tougher fight and suffer many more casualties than in the Gulf War. In that conflict, 148 soldiers were killed in combat, and 235 died outside combat.

<P>



   Hussein did not use chemical or biological weapons against US troops who pushed his fighters out of Kuwait.

<P>



   The United States cannot count on the international support it had in 1991. Many US allies oppose an invasion. In an article published Wednesday, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany warned that an attack on Iraq could destroy the coalition against terrorism.

<P>



   If the United States invaded Iraq on its own, it would be left paying the financial costs. The 1991 war cost the United States $61 billion; allies paid for all but about $7 billion.  ''If it's a coalition of one, it's a bill-payer of one,'' Samuel Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, told the Senate committee.

<P>



   Those costs could strain the federal budget, forcing policy-makers to cut domestic spending or raise taxes or see deficits balloon. World oil prices could rise.

<P> Without support from other countries, the United States also would lack access 

to foreign bases and air space. The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud, said 

Wednesday that his country has told the United States it cannot use his country's 

soil to attack on Iraq.
