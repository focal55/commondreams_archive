<p>The 2400 block of Woolsey Street in Berkeley is a neighborhood in the 

old-fashioned sense. Families here share more than a street. We've watched 

each other's children grow up; we've consoled and celebrated together; and, 

through the years, we've joined to keep our neighborhood intact and livable.

</table></font>Eight Woolsey Street households, some long-term residents and some 

relatively new on the block, comprise the Words on Woolsey project.

<P>The group came together shortly after the November elections, but our 

concern began after the 2000 presidential election and the months following 

Sept. 11 as we watched the Bush administration's increasingly belligerent and 

go-it-alone approach to foreign policy, its clear indifference to the Bill of 

Rights and its refusal to even give a hearing to dissenting voices on the 

gravest environmental and ecological problems. We've come to understand that 

secret dealmaking and bullying rhetoric are now the coins of the realm, and 

that the dissenting voices within the Republican Party and even in the 

Democratic Party have been effectively silenced.

<P>Our first project presents a simple message on a set of signs, inspired by 

the famous Burma Shave billboards that once lined the nation's highways. Two 

sets of signs, one for each side of the block, start out with "Bush foreign 

policy" followed by "All war all the time" and finish with "Bush domestic 

policy" followed by "All war all the time." The signs are silent, but they 

have quickly enlivened the conversations on our sidewalks.

</table></font>We hope, through this and other projects, to begin to revive discourse, 

debate and dissent in a nation that seems so calmly indifferent to the erosion 

of our own quality of life and so willing to base our national identity on the 

extension of military power and a new, American-style colonialism even more 

dependent on the exploitation of foreign resources and people to feed our 

economy.
