<p>The United States has intervened to quash a lawsuit filed against Exxon alleging that the energy company abetted abuses in Indonesia.</p>

<p>The State Department told a court that the action against Exxon, which sometimes uses the Esso name, could have a "potentially serious adverse impact on significant interests of the United States, directly related to the ongoing struggle against international terrorism".</p>

The suit was filed last year by the <a href="http://www.laborrights.org/" target="_new">International 

Labor Rights Fund</a> on behalf of 11 villagers from Aceh, a province that is 

a stronghold for Islamic extremists seeking secession from Indonesia. It was filed 

under a law that allows foreigners to sue American companies in US courts.</p> 

<p>Exxon is accused in the suit of having paid Indonesian security forces to protect its interests there while turning a blind eye to abuses they committed on villagers, including torture and rape. The company has denied the charges.</p>

<p>Washington has appealed to Indonesia to help fight terrorism and is worried that a suit could hurt its economy by discouraging foreign investment.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lchr.org/">Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights</a> 

in Washington said that the war on terrorism "is now going to be used as a cover 

for all kinds of corporate malfeasance".</p>
