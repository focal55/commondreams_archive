<p> Pedestrians in Harvard Square had their pick of rallies yesterday; students 

protested Coca-Cola's health-care policy in Africa at 2 p.m. and a different group 

demonstrated later against the Gap's labor policies in Central America. 

<P> The rally against Coca-Cola, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/iop/other-AIDS.html" target="_new">Harvard 

AIDS Coalition</a>, drew about 50 students, who, according to organizers, condemned 

the '' exploitation'' of African workers. Protesters contend that Coca-Cola is 

the largest private employer on the continent, but does not extend health benefits 

to 100,000 contract employees and their families, scores of whom are HIV-positive. 

<P> ''Why is it you can get a soda anywhere in Africa, but people infected with 

HIV can't get medication?'' asked organizer Florence Twu. 

<P> Attempts to reach Coca-Cola Co. for comment last night were unsuccessful. 

<P> Students protesting what they said were sweatshops the Gap clothing store 

chain runs in Central America argued that the average salary of the 100,000 textile 

workers in El Salvador is $5 a day - one third the daily salary considered to 

be poverty level by the government. 

<P> Ginny Coughlin, an organizer for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and 

Textile Employees, said that when some of the 10,000 employees working under contract 

for the Gap tried to unionize, the work was moved to different factories. 

<P> The protest, which organizers said drew about 100 people, highlighted a report 

by a group of students who recently returned from a fact-finding mission to some 

of the factories, as well as tearful speeches by Central American textile-factory 

employees. Coughlin said organizers are not yet calling for a boycott of the Gap, 

but are demanding accountability from corporate headquarters. 

<P> The store in Cambridge referred questions to a Gap spokesman. Calls to him 

were not returned last night, but a message on the company's Web site said, ''We 

want garment workers to be treated with dignity and respect.''
