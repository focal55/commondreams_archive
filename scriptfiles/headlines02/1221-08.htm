<p>UNITED NATIONS   - The United States vetoed a  Syrian-sponsored U.N. Security Council resolution that would  have condemned Israel for the recent killings of a Briton and  two Palestinians working for the United Nations in the West  Bank and Gaza.

<p>



		Twelve council members, including Britain, voted in favor  and Bulgaria and Cameroon abstained late on Friday.<p>



		But the negative vote by the United States, one of five  permanent council members with veto power, meant the resolution  was not adopted.<p>



		The proposed measure, backed by Arab nations, would have  condemned the killings by the Israeli army as well as the  destruction of a U.N. World Food Program warehouse in Gaza as a  violation of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention on the  protection of civilians in time of war.<p>



		U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, who had submitted a  substitute draft that removed the condemnation of Israel but  expressed "grave concern" at the killings, said Syria's  proposed resolution, was unbalanced and not conducive to Middle  East peace efforts.<p>



		"The proponents of this resolution appear more intent on  condemning Israeli occupation than on ensuring the safety of  U.N. personnel," he told the council before the vote.<p>



		Negroponte said the United States reserved the right to  resubmit its own resolution next week. But diplomats said Arab  nations had threatened to call an emergency U.N. General  Assembly if he did so.<p>



		The United States, which has vetoed some 30 Middle East  resolutions since 1972, last used its veto power in December  2001 to kill a resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<p>



		Syria's U.N. ambassador Mikhail Wehbe said he had accepted  amendments from council members all week but the United States  was "attempting to equate the victim with the butcher."<p>



		Palestinian envoy Nasser al-Kidwa told the council he could  not understand the U.S. veto "but we note that the United  States is biased toward Israel."<p>



		"It seems that this bias knows no limit even if this has to  be at the expense of international humanitarian law and if it  comes at the expense of the lives of those who work in the  humanitarian field," he said.<p>



		KILLING OF BRITON<p>



		Israeli soldiers killed Briton Iain Hook on Nov. 22 after a  gunbattle with Palestinians in the West Bank Jenin refugee  camp. A week later two Palestinians were shot in Gaza. All  worked for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, known as UNRWA,  which gives aid to Palestinians.<p>



		The Israeli army said its soldiers mistook a cell phone  that Hook, a senior UNRWA official, was holding for a weapon  and that gunmen had entered a walled U.N. compound in Jenin.<p>



		But U.N. officials denied this and said there was no threat  to Israeli soldiers near the U.N. compound.<p>



		Aaron Jacob, Israel's deputy U.N. ambassador, said his  country was investigating Hook's death and would make its  finding known "to the relevant authorities."<p>



		"While it is right and proper to scrutinize the action of  states, failure to hold accountable those armed groups who  abused the protected status of civilians only encourage  terrorist groups to increase their reliance on this  reprehensible tactic, he said."<p>



		Calling the draft resolution a "cynical diplomatic game,"  Jacob said the peace process was frozen and "the credibility of  the Palestinian leadership is barely greater than zero."<p>



		"The only difference is the number of gravestones that  stand as a testament to the failed policies of the past," he  said.<p>



		The Security Council on Dec. 13 condemned last month's  attacks in Mombasa, Kenya against Israeli tourists, explicitly  mentioning Israeli victims of terrorism for the first time.<p>



		Syria cast the lone negative vote on that occasion, arguing  the resolution was one-sided because Israel too had committed  "terrorist atrocities."<p>
