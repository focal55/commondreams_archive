<p>WASHINGTON - Harvard University's financial relationship with President Bush's 

former oil company was deeper than previously understood, with the university's 

management fund creating a separate ''off the books'' partnership with Harken 

Energy Corp. that helped keep afloat the financially troubled company, according 

to a report to be released today. 

<P> <a href="http://www.harvardwatch.org/" target="_new">HarvardWatch</a>, a student-alumni 

group that monitors the school's investments, plans to issue the report and say 

that it has analyzed documents showing that the Harvard fund, an independent entity 

that manages the university's endowment, formed a partnership in 1990 with Bush's 

oil firm called the Harken Anadarko Partnership. The partnership effectively removed 

$20 million of debt from Harken's books, relieving the Texas company's short-term 

financial problems. 

<P> About the same time, the Harvard fund invested about $30 million in Harken, 

which also helped keep the firm afloat. The partnership has not been mentioned 

in recent accounts of Bush's financial dealings in the oil business. 

<P> William K. Black, a former federal banking regulator, said in a telephone 

interview that he has examined the Harken Anadarko Partnership and concluded the 

arrangement was a significant expansion of the Harvard fund's involvement in the 

company beyond the $30 million investment. 

<P> ''Harvard had a dramatically larger financial stake and a much more interesting 

financial stake'' than was previously understood, Black said. ''It all serves 

as a partnership device to move money from Harvard to Harken. This is beyond nuts 

from an institutional investor's standpoint.'' 

<P> The creation of the partnership was approved in a motion made by Bush, who 

was on the Harken board of directors and its audit committee, said Black, an assistant 

professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Austin. 

<P> White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the idea of the partnership came 

from the Harvard fund. 

<P> ''This is something that Harvard proposed, and Harvard set the terms of the 

partnership,'' McClellan said yesterday. ''Harvard proposed the partnership because 

Harvard decided it wanted to get more involved in the energy sector and be more 

directly involved in operational aspects.'' 

<P> Representatives of Harvard Management and Houston-based Harken Energy did 

not return phone calls seeking comment on the partnership. 

<P> In May 1990, Black said, the Harvard fund and another unnamed shareholder 

loaned Harken a total of $46 million. But with Harken still having a debt load, 

the fund and Harken formed the Harken Anadarko Partnership in December 1990. The 

partnership was ''off the Harken books,'' Black said, which he said means that 

Harken's stake in the partnership was reported but the financial details did not 

need to be revealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

<P> Such a partnership was legal, he said. 

<P> According to Black, the partnership was set up to help Harken avoid bankruptcy 

and included $64.5 million worth of unrelated energy properties owned by the Harvard 

fund and $26 million of drilling operations from Harken - along with $20 million 

worth of Harken's debt and liabilities. Harken held a 16 percent stake in the 

partnership while the Harvard fund owned 84 percent, according to HarvardWatch. 

Nonetheless, the operation was run by Harken, which was paid $1 million per year 

to operate the partnership's oil and gas ventures, the report said. 

<P> Harken ''transferred an enormous amount of liabilities to the partnership,'' 

Black said. ''You don't see the Harvards of the world doing things like this.'' 

<P> With so much debt removed from Harken's own books, Harken's stock price rose 

and the Harvard fund sold 1.6 million shares during this temporary stock bubble, 

the report says. 

<P> The formation of the partnership, coupled with the fund's purchase of Harken 

stock, kept the firm afloat financially, according to Black. Black's review of 

the partnership may add weight to the findings of HarvardWatch. 

<P> Black, a registered Democrat, is a well-known specialist in reviewing financial 

transactions; he was the deputy director of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 

Corp. during the Reagan and first Bush administrations and played a key role in 

investigating the ''Keating Five'' scandal that involved five senators. Black 

also played a role in the investigation that helped lead to the resignation of 

House Speaker Jim Wright, a Democrat. He said he has conducted financial reviews 

that make him unpopular among Democrats and said he did not examine the Harken 

partnership for political reasons. 

<P> It was 1986 when George W. Bush's struggling oil venture, Spectrum 7, was 

purchased by Harken. Harken gave Bush a seat on the board of directors and an 

annual paycheck of $120,000. At the time, Bush's father, George H. W. Bush, was 

vice president. It was around this same time that the Harvard fund began investing 

in Harken. The fund eventually poured $30 million into Harken and became the largest 

shareholder. A Harvard Management official, Michael Eisenson, was given a seat 

on the Harken board.
