<p>Police arrested nine anti-war protesters at Rep. Tom Lantos' office in 

San Mateo after they entered the building Thursday afternoon and refused to 

leave.

<P>The protesters wanted Lantos to sign a pledge saying he would vote against 

a pre-emptive military strike on Iraq and work with the United Nations to 

prevent any action against the Arab nation.

<P>Officers arrested the protesters for trespassing and released them after 

returning to the police station, said Lt. Barbara Hammerman.

<P>Lantos is the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations 

Committee and has supported President Bush's call for action against Saddam 

Hussein.

<P>Lantos represents southwest San Francisco and much of the Peninsula.

<P>The protesters were among 100 or so demonstrators who gathered outside 

Lantos' office on El Camino Real. Many carried signs bearing slogans like "No 

blood for oil" and "George Jr. don't pour gas on the fire."

<P>The Peninsula Peace and Justice Center, based in Palo Alto, led the effort 

with Global Exchange, a human rights organization based in San Francisco.

<P>"We are focusing on Congressman Lantos because he is very much out of step 

with the Bay Area opinion on this issue," said Ted Lewis, human rights 

director for Global Exchange.

<P>Neither Lantos nor his spokesman could be reached for comment.
