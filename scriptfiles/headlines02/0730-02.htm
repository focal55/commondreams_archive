</table>It aims to secure consensus on uncontentious issues, and purely voluntary agreements on more ambitious goals.

<P>

The approach could go a long way to make the summit's goals a reality.

<P>

But there are fears it may play into the hands of governments unwilling to make real changes. 

<P>

The acknowledgement that the UN's strategy is fraught with problems comes from Jan Pronk, the special envoy to the WSSD of the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan.

<P>

Mr Pronk, a former Dutch environment minister, briefing journalists in London, UK, said Johannesburg would need to agree a plan of action, with an agreed timeframe on implementation. 

<P>

There were three areas, constituting an action plan, needing agreement:

<UL><LI>Agenda 21, the sustainable development plan of action drawn up at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit

<LI>the Millennium Goals, which Mr Pronk said effectively meant "halving world poverty by 2015"

<LI>financial commitments to implement the plan.</UL>

There will be two levels of commitment sought from governments: consensus agreements, a sort of lowest common denominator approach, known as type one, and voluntary type two commitments, much more ambitious but entirely voluntary.

<P>

<B>Results expected</B>

<P> Mr Pronk said: "Type two is for the many countries which are willing to go 

further. 

"It will let them set up networks with other countries, with business, and with 

non-governmental organizations.

<P>

He told BBC News Online: "The cynics can certainly say this is something that may let unenthusiastic governments agree very little.

<P>

"But the developing countries want agreement on a text first, and then the topping-up through type two agreements. 

<P>

"That's pragmatism, the only possible approach. This is a UN conference, and countries have been told they'll have to negotiate an outcome.

<P>

"It is a risky strategy. But you have to take risks."

<P>

Mr Pronk said he thought preparations for Johannesburg had taken "a good turn" since the fractious preparatory meeting in Bali in June.

<P>

"All the signs are that the Bali problems are not insurmountable," he said.

<P>

<B>Attendance not optional</B>

<P>

"I expect the WSSD will be a success, meaning it won't be a failure. But whether it's simply a success or a big success depends on commitment to guarantee the implementation of the action plan.

<P>

"Many countries see Johannesburg as an opportunity to address some of the underlying causes of alienation, frustration and the inclination towards violence.

<P> "George Bush should be told he can't afford not to attend. It's not a question 

of the US doing something for others - the interests of its people are at stake." 

<P> The twin-track approach fills some observers with dismay. The UK's Royal Society 

for the Protection of Birds, a key environmental policy campaign body, is among 

them. 

<P> It says it is "concerned that type two agreements are principally a US cover 

for business as usual, and for governments to produce a weak plan of action". 

<P> <B>American support</B> 

<P> Liana Stupples, of Friends of the Earth, told BBC News Online: "Type two agreements 

are an unproven way of trying to run the world on a whim and a guess. 

<P> "They give the US a trump card, allowing it to continue to exercise a veto." 

<P> But Derek Osborn, chair of the UN Environment and Development UK Committee, 

told BBC News Online: "Partnerships like this are a good idea, and a complement 

to effective action. 

<P> "That mustn't let governments off the hook. But it's easy to cast all the 

blame on the US. 

<P> "They're not being purely negative, and we sometimes have a beam in our own 

eye, anyway."
