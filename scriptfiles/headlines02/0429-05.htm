SAUGUS - In a sharp staccato, an eager auctioneer barked prices at the crowd inside the Caruso's Diplomat ballroom on Route 1 yesterday, tempting bidders with 13 not-quite-new vehicles seized from the state Lottery Commission. 

<P>''Twelve thousand, eight hundred! Sold!'' he declared as the state unloaded one of 11 Ford Taurus wagons.</P>

</font>In this space, far from battles on Beacon Hill, buyers - everyone from professional dealers to a giddy 38-year-old and her mother - competed for the cars taken away from the lottery in one of the most unusual chapters in the struggle over funding the Clean Elections public financing campaign law.

<P>''I know nothing whatsoever about Clean Elections,'' said Edward Hutton, 58, of North Quincy, still smiling from the realization that his $12,800 offer had secured him a 2002 Taurus wagon. And he didn't seem to want to know more, he was simply happy to collect his car.</P>







<P>Jackie Comeau, 38, of Lynnfield, had similar feelings as she savored her bidding victory. The politics, she said, ''doesn't affect me.''</P>







<P>It was a strange afternoon, but, in Massachusetts these days, the fight over public financing of elections is anything but ordinary.</P>







<P>The Clean Elections supporters have been blocked repeatedly this year in their efforts to fully launch the new campaign system. They won a victory in January, when the Supreme Judicial Court ruled the Legislature is in violation of the state constitution and should appropriate the money. But lawmakers again refused, so a single justice of the SJC permitted the auction instead.</P>







<P>''I think it's a sad day for the Commonwealth,'' said former state senator Warren Tolman, who is running for governor under the Clean Elections system.</P>







<P>Under the law, funds were to be distributed to candidates who agreed to limit fund-raising and spending for the 2002 election. Despite an order from the state's highest court, the Legislature has refused to repeal or fund the measure.</P>







<P>Maine and Arizona passed similar laws. But in those states, money has been made available and the system is functioning.</P>







<P>''Massachusetts is the only state in the country where a Legislature has failed to implement a mandate of the voters,'' said Ken White, executive director of Common Cause, a public interest group. ''When we passed the law in 1998, I think everyone took the constitution at face value.''</P>







<P>It has been more than four years since actor Alec Baldwin, joined by 3,000 volunteers, canvassed the Commonwealth in support of a ballot initiative promising public funds to political candidates who limit individual campaign contributions to $100. Clean Elections passed by a 2-1 ratio.</P>







<P>The two-year delay built into the initiative gave lawmakers a chance to adjust to the system. But Clean Elections activists say the state's elected leaders used the time to weaken the law and mobilize legislative opposition.</P>







<P>''I felt duped,'' Tolman said. ''They encouraged people to run by setting aside </P>







<P>money and, all of a sudden, none of it is available.''</P>







<P>House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, a leading opponent of the law, has argued that in a time of budget deficits, the funds would be wasted on political campaigns. On Friday, Finneran, through a spokesman, refused to comment.</P>







<P>But other opponents of Clean Elections have questioned the public auctioning off of state property, and say supporters of the measure have turned the debate into a circus, especially with their recent threat to sell Finneran's office furniture. And some lawmakers say the public understands that social services and other state programs must take priority over Clean Elections.</P>







<P>''This isn't anyone's choice of how it would turn out,'' White said. ''Auctioning state assets is an extreme solution, but extreme circumstances call for unusual measures.''</P>







<P>Tolman, as well as two legislative candidates, will receive funds from the $176,800 raised at yesterday's auction. Tolman has already received $582,000 from a court-controlled legal settlement fund, which is now depleted.</P>







<P>Clean Elections supporters may also ask for the sale of public land, but the 30-day processing period has deterred plaintiffs from exercising that option. They are also investigating the possibility of seizing legislators' parking spaces under the State House, but their legal prospects for dividing the property are unclear.</P>







<P>In addition to vehicles from the state Highway Department, the next auction, which could take place as early as next weekend, may put Finneran's office furniture on the block. The attorney general, saying the sale would disrupt the functioning of state government, stymied activists' first attempt to seize the furniture. A hearing on the matter is set for today before Supreme Judicial Court Justice Martha Sosman.</P>
