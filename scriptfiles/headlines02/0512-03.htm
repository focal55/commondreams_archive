<p>WASHINGTON - 

Grandma may be upset that her

teen-age son will not eat her chicken casserole, but U.S.

researchers say vegetarian teen-agers have a healthier diet

than their meat-eating counterparts.

<p>



What many parents may fear is youthful rebellion or even an

unhealthy way of keeping off weight is actually a good way to

get the recommended vitamins and minerals -- and avoid fatty

junk food in the process, a team at the University of Minnesota

found.

<p>

"It seems that rather than viewing adolescent vegetarianism

as a difficult phase or fad, the dietary pattern could be

viewed as a healthy alternative to the traditional American

meat-based diet," epidemiologist Cheryl Perry and colleagues

wrote in Sunday's issue of the journal Archives of Pediatric

Adolescent Medicine.

<p>

They studied more than 4,500 teen-agers, with an average

age of about 15, from 31 middle schools and high schools in

Minnesota. Of them, about 262, or nearly 6 percent, said they

were vegetarian.

<p>

They compared the diets of these boys and girls to the

Healthy People 2010 recommendations, which are dietary targets

issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

<p>

They include goals of getting less than 30 percent of one's

daily calories from fat and less than 10 percent from saturated

fat, eating more than two servings of fruit and three servings

of vegetables daily.

<p>

"Overall, adolescent vegetarians were significantly more

likely to meet the dietary recommendations of Healthy People

2010," Perry's group wrote.

<p>

"Vegetarian adolescents were more than twice as likely to

eat less than 30 percent of their calories from fat and nearly

three times more likely to eat less than 10 percent of their

calories from saturated fat," they added.

<p>

"They were also 1.4 to two times more likely to eat two or

more servings of fruit, three or more servings of vegetables

... and five or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily."

<p>

Both the vegetarians and the meat-eaters failed to get

enough calcium every day, the researchers found, but the

vegetarians got significantly more iron, vitamin A, folate and

fiber.

<p>

They also drank more diet soda and caffeine, which the

researchers said reflected the desire of most of the teen-agers

to keep weight off.

<p>

"Vegetarian adolescents, similar to their adult

counterparts, have dietary patterns that, if maintained, could

significantly lower their risk of the leading causes of death

as adults," the researchers said.
