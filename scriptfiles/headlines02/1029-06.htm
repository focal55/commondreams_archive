France is privately warning the US and the UK that they will be left alone in the political and economic task of reconstructing Iraq if they press ahead with a war on Saddam Hussein without UN support. 

<P>The French warning comes as the US and UK demanded a decision from the UN security 

council this week in support of a tough new resolution, or recognize that the 

British and the US will take unilateral action. 

<P>But the French foreign minister, Dominque de Villepin, yesterday refused to back down as the last round of the six weeks of talks on the text of a UN resolution got under way in New York.  <P>He insisted that France would not support any clause in a UN resolution that could be interpreted as giving the US automatic authority to take military action if Iraq is deemed to be in breach of the proposed new weapons inspection regime.  <P>The French warned that the lack of UN authority for military strikes would mean the US could not hope for the kind of international initiative seen in Afghanistan to rebuild the country. The threat is one of the few negotiating levers left to the French.  <P>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said Britain would prefer to see agreement on a UN resolution, but could not wait indefinitely. "We would prefer there to be a security council resolution and we would prefer this to be resolved by peaceful means," Mr Straw told MPs on the Commons foreign affairs select committee. "But I know that it can only be resolved by peaceful means if we are prepared for and prepared to take military action.  <P>"We do not rule out the possibility of being involved in military action within international law even if there is no UN security council resolution. But I would prefer there to be a new resolution."   <P>Mr Straw was speaking as the latest Guardian tracking poll showed that Britain is now almost evenly split over whether or not to support military action.  <P>The balance of opinion remains marginally on the side of the 40% (unchanged in the last week) who oppose the war as against the 38% (up 3 points) who believe that military action against Baghdad is needed.  

<P>The results of the weekly tracker poll on Iraq, which the Guardian has been 

running since August, show that opposition to war has retained the backing of 

about two-fifths of voters since the crisis intensified over the summer. Similarly, 

about one in three voters have consistently said they support military intervention. 

<P>This week's poll confirms the existence of a strong gender gap in attitudes 

towards military intervention. Among men the balance of opinion is in favor of 

an attack by 45% to 35%. Among women the position is reversed with 46% disapproving 

of a military attack and only 32% in favor

<P>The increasingly impatient US calls for a decision from the UN this week were echoed strongly by the prime minister's spokesman and other government sources. If no agreement is reached by the end of this week, there is little expectation that a fresh resolution will be agreed.  <P>Expressing his irritation with French tactics, Mr Straw said: "You could end up with a situation where the future integrity of the whole system of international law is at stake - military action is necessary and yet one or two members of the security council decide to veto it."  <P>The British stance follows renewed efforts by the Bush administration over the last few days to ratchet up the pressure on France, Russia and China.  <P>"This is coming down to the wire," Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman, said yesterday, as he accompanied George Bush on the mid-term campaign election trail.  <P><B>&#183;</B> ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between October 25-27. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.
