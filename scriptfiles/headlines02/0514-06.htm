<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - An e-mail from a high-ranking staff member of the Bush 

administration's energy task force said officials were "desperately trying to 

avoid California" in a report dealing with the energy crisis last year, Rep. 

Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, said Monday.

<P>The e-mail, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by watchdog and 

environmental groups and also provided to Waxman, was largely redacted, and 

neither administration officials nor the congressman could say specifically 

what the task force staffer was discussing.

<P>But Waxman seized on the missive to turn the heat up on the White House to 

release all documents relating to the task force's discussions about 

California's energy crisis.

<P>Waxman said the e-mail, along with the recent release of documents showing 

Enron sought to manipulate the California energy market, "underscores the need 

for the administration to provide a complete accounting of its understanding 

of and approach to the energy crisis."

<P>The e-mail was sent May 4, 2001, by Karen Knutson, deputy director of the 

energy task force, to Jacob Moss of the Environmental Protection Agency. It 

raised concerns about putting into the report a paragraph "emphasizing 

environmentally difficult issues about expediting permitting to deal with a 

crisis."

<P>"We are desperately trying to avoid California in this report as much as 

possible," the e-mail continues. "Can you make the same point without going 

into California . . ."

<P>Knutson could not be reached for comment, and administration officials 

could not immediately say what it was about California that she sought to keep 

out of the report. But they defended their actions on California's energy 

crisis.

<P>"Congressman Waxman has confused the Bush administration with the lack 

of action taken by the Clinton administration," Energy Department spokeswoman 

Jeanne Lopatto said. She said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, on 

Bush's watch, had imposed electricity price controls and begun an 

investigation into whether Enron and other power sellers sought to use their 

market power to drive up prices.

<P>The task force report released last year actually features California 

prominently, using the state's problems to bolster its arguments for building 

more power plants.

<P>Waxman said the e-mail raised questions about whether the widespread 

deletion of information from thousands of pages of documents turned over by 

federal agencies was the result of the administration's claims that disclosure 

would chill frank and open discussion or was intended to avoid embarrassment.

<P>Waxman's letter was the latest salvo in a yearlong effort by congressional 

Democrats to force the administration to make public details of private 

meetings held with lobbyists during drafting of the energy plan.

<P>The battle was fired up last week with the release of internal Enron memos 

that detailed an array of Enron price-manipulation strategies. Two Senate 

committees plan hearings on the memos Wednesday.</p>
