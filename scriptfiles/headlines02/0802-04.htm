<p>France's unlikely folk hero, the walrus-mustached sheep farmer and crusader 

against globalization Jos&#233; Bov&#233;, was given a rapturous reception by 

800 cheering supporters yesterday when he emerged from prison after 44 days behind 

bars. 

<P>Bov&#233;, who was serving the remainder of a three-month sentence for wrecking 

a partly built McDonald's restaurant in the south of France three years ago, denounced 

the new center-right government for sending him, a trade union leader, to prison, 

and said he would continue his fight against la malbouffe (lousy food), come what 

may.

</table></font>Looking a lot thinner after being on hunger strike for four weeks at Villeneuve-les-Maguelone 

jail near Montpellier, the leader of the radical Conf&#233;d&#233;ration Paysanne, 

thanked the crowd for its support, which had "turned this intolerable sentence 

into a resistance movement". 

<P>Beaming broadly, he added: "Our struggle is just starting. We must denounce 

the arbitrary actions of a government that puts trade union leaders into jail. 

<P>"Prison is abominable, but I was here for all of you, so that helped me." 

<P>He said he had received about 2,000 letters a day from well-wishers during 

his spell in prison: where he may well return later this year if another French 

court finds him guilty of two incidents of destroying genetically modified maize. 

<P>The verdict is expected on September 16. 

<P>His attack on the McDonald's in Millau in August 1999 was prompted by America's 

decision to impose punitive import tariffs on such French specialties as Dijon 

mustard, foie gras and Roquefort cheese (which Mr Bov&#233; produces). Washington 

was retaliating against the European Union's refusal to lift a ban on US hormone-treated 

beef. 

<P>"We had no other way to denounce this scandal," he said at a huge picnic outside 

the prison immediately after his release. 

<P>"The World Trade Organization had just ordered Europe to accept hormone-treated 

beef. It was illegal, but when legality is illegitimate, it becomes perfectly 

legitimate to move into illegality." 

<P>The once-portly campaigner, a media-savvy fixture at anti-globalization rallies 

and WTO protests from Seattle to Genoa, drank only water and one glass of orange 

juice a day for almost a month in prison and lost about 11kg (24Ib). 

<P>He described his time in jail as an "unbearable experience unfit for any human 

being", and said he now planned to take a week's much-needed holiday on his sailing 

boat with his partner, Ghislaine Ricez, to recover. 

<P>The justice minister, Dominique Perben, admitted yesterday that Bov&#233;'s 

growing popularity posed something of a problem to the French judicial system. 

<P>"He's an awkward customer for the jail services," he said. "But he's served 

his sentence, and he's getting out. I hope he has fewer problems with the justice 

system in future."</p>
