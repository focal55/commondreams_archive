<p> KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa  - In a dark  storeroom in the Kruger National Park lies the booty of a  massive environmental war: South Africa's ivory collection.

<p>



		"This is an asset," said Kruger's public relations manager  William Mabasa as he pointed to the almost 5,000 pieces --  nearly 37 metric tons -- of the "white gold" stacked along  wooden shelves.<p>



		Many conservationists would view the room as a ghastly  chamber of horrors.<p>



		In November animal rights groups howled in protest when the  12th conference of the Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species (CITES) in Chile gave South Africa tentative  permission to auction 30 metric tons of ivory.<p>



		Neighboring Botswana and Namibia were also given the  conditional go-ahead to auction 20 and 10 metric tons,  respectively, from their stockpiles.<p>



		The auctions cannot be held before May 2004 to give CITES a  chance to monitor poaching and population trends.<p>



		CITES will not allow the sales if the monitoring networks  detect an upsurge in the poaching of elephants -- which is  precisely what many conservationists and some elephant range  states like Kenya believe is already happening.<p>



		They fear that poachers, anticipating fresh demand for a  commodity that has been banned from the global market since  1989, with the exception of "experimental sales" by Zimbabwe,  Namibia and Botswana in 1999, will try to build up supplies now  in a bid to launder dirty ivory with the clean supplies.<p>



		South Africa says it needs to unlock the value of its  stockpile for badly needed conservation projects.<p>



		"The current South African government has many priorities  -- crime, health care, poverty -- and so conservation really  has to pay its way," Mavuso Msimang, CEO of South Africa  National Parks, told Reuters.<p>



		"We need to sell this ivory for conservation," he added.<p>



		LOCATION OF IVORY ROOM A TIGHTLY-GUARDED SECRET<p>



		The 4,844 pieces of ivory in South Africa's ivory room --  some tusks are broken up -- have each been recorded  meticulously and given a CITES number.<p>



		Access is extremely limited and the building's description  and precise location cannot be disclosed for security reasons.<p>



		Only two senior park officials are allowed to open the door  -- and only if they are both present as they each have  different keys.<p>



		The biggest tusk, at about 6 1/2 feet in length and  weighing 130 pounds, must have belonged to a truly massive  animal.<p>



		Much of the ivory has been collected in the bush from the  carcasses of animals that died from natural causes.<p>



		Some of the tusks sat in the bush for a long time and have  a weathered look, their surface browned and roughened to the  point that it looks almost like tree bark.<p>



		The ivory was reaped from controversial culls once used to  control Kruger's elephants. No cull has been conducted since  1994 and there are concerns that the population is now too big  for the habitat available -- even in a park the size of Israel.<p>



		These concerns are driving plans for a transfrontier park  with neighboring Mozambique, where it is hoped Kruger's  "excess" elephants might find additional space to roam and  feed.<p>



		The last survey, in July and August 2002, showed that there  were 10,459 elephants in Kruger, up from around 7,800 at the  time of the last cull -- a 34 percent rise in just eight years.<p>



		ELEPHANTS ELSEWHERE IN DECLINE<p>



		Botswana and Namibia also have healthy, growing  populations.<p>



		But elsewhere in Africa, populations of the world's largest  land mammal are -- or have been until recently -- in decline.<p>



		Conservationists fear that fresh ivory sales will rekindle  a bloodbath in the bush that saw Africa's elephant population  plummet from an estimated 1.2 million to 600,000 in the space  of a little over a decade.<p>



		The 1989 ivory trade ban is widely credited with stemming  that slaughter, itself triggered by a surge in demand from  newly affluent Asian economies which sent prices soaring.<p>



		Long before the mass poaching of the 1970s and 1980s, the  trade had soaked the world's poorest continent in blood.<p>



		Along with slaves, gold and rubber, the allure of ivory  drew Europeans to Africa's shores and played a major role in  some of the darkest chapters of white colonial rule on the  continent.<p>



		Demand for the coveted commodity led to the massacre of the  elephants of Africa and the Middle East, which once numbered in  the millions. And 19th century ivory workshops churned out a  range of products from piano keys to billiard balls, fueling  the killing.<p>



		The South Africans maintain that the free-for-all  slaughters of the past can be prevented by strict monitoring of  the ivory, which will likely be sold to Japanese buyers.<p>



		"Inspectors are welcome to be there when the ivory is  packed for shipment and be there on the other end when the  shipment is opened up," said Msimang.<p>



		Critics contend that the South Africans are ignoring  evidence of an increase in poaching in their own backyard.<p>



		In 1981, 102 of the park's elephants were poached but this  number was almost halved the following year.<p>



		The number of elephants killed illegally dropped off  sharply and in 2000 and 2001 no elephants were known to have  been poached there -- the first two-year period in decades with  no recorded elephant poaching incidents.<p>



		But this year, at least five elephants were killed in the  park -- and Kenya and conservation groups are seething because  South Africa failed to inform CITES about the killings when it  applied for permission to sell part of its Kruger stock.<p>



		"It was a mistake on our part, we did not inform the  department of environmental affairs about the killings. But the  information gathered for our CITES proposal was made around  July, before the carcasses were found," said Msimang.<p>



		The jury is out on the ultimate impact of the impending  ivory auctions on poaching in Africa.

		<p>



		In the mean time, South Africa's ivory room will remain  firmly locked up.
