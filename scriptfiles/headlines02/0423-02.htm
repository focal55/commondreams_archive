Having led the nation in divesting from South Africa and helping bring 

an end to apartheid, the Berkeley City Council tonight will consider clearing 

the city's portfolio of investments in Israel and Palestinian territory in an 

attempt to bring peace to the Middle East.

<P>The ambitious plan also calls on City Hall to boycott firms doing business 

with Israel and the Palestinians and would prohibit the purchase of products 

made there. Backers believe it would make Berkeley the first city to boycott 

the two sides.

<P>No one backing the proposal by the city's Peace and Justice Commission 

believes that Berkeley alone can end the violence. But they hope other cities 

will follow its lead, creating economic incentive for Jews and Palestinians to 

make peace.

<P>"Berkeley is a small city, and its economy is not going to make or break 

the Middle East," said commissioner Steve Freedkin. "But if others follow suit, it could have quite an impact."

<P>The true effect of the measure remains to be seen, as no one at City Hall 

had a clue yesterday how much money Berkeley has invested in the region, nor 

did anyone know how many contracts it holds with companies doing business with 

Israel and the Palestinians.

<P>City Manager Weldon Rucker is urging the council to delay action until May 

28 so he can answer those questions. He also wonders how the measure would be 

adopted and enforced.

<P>"Managing this thing would be a major undertaking," said Fred Medrano, who 

supervises the Peace and Justice Commission for Rucker. "The finance 

department is real concerned with its ability to implement this."

<P>If the measure is approved, every city investment and contract would have 

to be reviewed. The effect could be huge because some of the nation's biggest 

companies, including General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, AOL 

Time Warner and Microsoft do business in Israel.

<P>While there is mounting pressure on many college campuses -- including the 

University of California at Berkeley -- for universities to divest from Israel, Berkeley is unique in making targets of both Israel and the Palestinians.

<P>"We feel that all parties need to respect human rights and provide for 

peace and security in the region," Freedkin said.

<P>Although the council probably will delay deciding on divestiture, it is 

expected to embrace the commission's more mainstream proposals, including 

"supporting all efforts by individuals and groups toward a just peace in 

Israel and Palestine."

<P>Berkeley has long used its pocketbook to influence global affairs with 

varying degrees of success. Its pioneering decision to divest from South 

Africa in 1979 was widely seen as a turning point in the effort to end 

apartheid.

<P>But the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago unanimously barred Berkeley and 

other cities from boycotting Burma because the United States must speak with 

one voice in foreign affairs.

<P>In an embarrassing turn of events, the city in 1997 had to scramble to find 

a gasoline supplier when it decided to boycott Nigeria, precluding it from 

dealing with most petroleum firms.
