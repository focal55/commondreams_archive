<p>CARACAS - Over the two years preceding the thwarted coup in April against President 

Hugo Chavez, a US-funded prodemocracy group financed a range of antigovernment 

programs, including some that have come under scrutiny for the way they spent 

their money. 

<P>An examination of grants of more than $1 million, given to organizations in 

Venezuela by the National Endowment for Democracy, has found that US tax money 

financed several Chavez opponents, including two organizations prominent in the 

protests that led up to the coup. The documents and interviews also report that 

money sent to one US-funded organization never reached its intended target and 

that another organization apparently falsified its Venezuelan accomplishments.</P>

<P>An endowment-funded trip to Washington by Chavez opponents may have accelerated 

the events leading to the April 11 uprising.</P>

<P>The revolt against Chavez fell apart after two days, allowing him to return 

to power. The United States soon came under a barrage of criticism for appearing 

to support the coup against a democratically elected president, apparently in 

contradiction to US policy to strengthen democracy in Latin America.</P>

<P>The endowment, founded in 1983 during the Cold War, is a private, nonprofit 

institution that receives almost all of its annual $33 million budget from the 

US Congress. Its purpose is to strengthen democracy worldwide, but critics have 

accused it of acting as an extension of US foreign policy.</P>

<P>In 2000 and 2001, as opposition to Chavez's leftist policies intensified Venezuela's 

political and social crisis, the endowment more than tripled funding to the country, 

from $257,831 to $877,435, according to the organization's grants lists. On April 

12, the president of one of the endowment's ''core grantees,'' the International 

Republican Institute, praised the removal of Chavez.</P>

<P>Chavez, a charismatic populist who favors leftist rhetoric, won the presidency 

in a 1998 landslide. He has frustrated Washington by befriending the leaders of 

Cuba, Iran, and Iraq, by criticizing the war in Afghanistan, and by favoring increases 

in international oil prices. Venezuela is the third-largest oil exporter to the 

United States.</P>

<P>At home, too, the confrontational Chavez has made many enemies. In April, street 

protests resulted in 17 deaths, which prompted military officials to arrest Chavez 

and replace him with Pedro Carmona, a pro-US businessman. Chavez loyalists then 

swept him back into office.</P>

<P>Shortly after the coup, The New York Times reported that the National Endowment 

for Democracy had financed opposition groups, highlighting the money sent to a 

union opposed to Chavez. More recently, scrutiny has focused on how the money 

was spent.</P>

<P>The country's biggest union, the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, received 

$154,377 last year, more than double its $60,084 grant in 2000. The group was 

a leader in the protests that led up to Chavez's ouster. </P>

<P>Part of the grant, distributed by the AFL-CIO's American Center for International 

Labor Solidarity, another of the endowment's recipient, was supposed to have paid 

for union elections in November. But the money is being used for courses at the 

confederation's training institute,<b> </b> said institute director Jesus Urbieta.</P>

<P>Urbieta has said that all the US money was spent to rent classrooms, pay teachers' 

salaries, and finance legitimate training efforts.</P>

<P>Alfredo Ramos, a member of the confederation's executive committee who is also 

a congressman and opponent of Chavez, said that Urbieta is close to one of the 

principal anti-Chavez political parties and that the institute operates without 

financial oversight.</P>

<P>''They don't have to show their books,'' Ramos said. The union did not provide 

him with a report on how the money was spent, he added.</P>

<P>A second organization prominent in the anti-Chavez demonstrations, the Assembly 

of Education, received a $55,000 grant to monitor education reform. The name of 

the assembly's director, Leonardo Carvajal, was listed as the prospective minister 

of education in papers left behind by Carmona after he fled the presidential palace. 

Carvajal said the endowment funds were used for carrying out workshops.</P>

<P>Several other beneficiaries of endowment funds are also headed by Chavez critics.</P>

<P>The director of the organization Process of Legislative Development, which 

received a $50,000 grant in 2000 to promote government decentralization, was secretary 

to the exiled former president, Carlos Andres Perez.</P>

<P>In January, the Venezuelan media broadcast a recorded telephone conversation 

between Perez and Carlos Ortega, president of the Confederation of Venezuelan 

Workers, in which the pair plotted against Chavez.</P>

<P>In testimony to the National Assembly in May, Ortega acknowledged his conversation 

with Perez but said all decisions concerning union activism had been made by the 

union alone. He said the endowment money had been used for ''development, training, 

and education of union members.''</P>

<P>Although Chavez antagonized much of Venezuela's civil society, the inclusion 

of so many government opponents among endow ment grant recipients angers Chavez 

supporters.</P>

<P>''This must be investigated because almost all of these organizations are open 

enemies of the Chavez government,'' said Tarik William Saab, a congressman and 

a leader of Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement party.</P>

<P>Neither the endowment nor the AFL-CIO's labor solidarity center responded to 

repeated requests for interviews. In April, an endowment official told the Times 

that none of its money had gone to support the coup.</P>

<P>The International Republican Institute, which has an office in Caracas and 

is an arm of the US Republican Party, also has been questioned over its activities 

and of the anti-Chavez zeal of its leader. The institute's grant from the National 

Endowment for Democracy grew from $50,000 in 2000, to promote youth participation 

in politics, to $339,998 last year for political party building.</P>

<P>On the day of the coup, the institute's president, George A. Folsom, sent news 

media a fax rejoicing over Chavez's fall. ''The Venezuelan people rose up to defend 

democracy in their country,'' he wrote.</P>

<P>The institute's grant in 2000 had been intended for work with a Venezuelan 

partner organization, the Youth Participation Foundation. </P>

<P>But dozens of interviews with activists, leaders of nongovernmental organizations, 

and government officials - including several people who had worked with the institute 

- turned up no evidence that the foundation had actually existed or that forums 

supposedly sponsored by the foundation and organized by the institute had been 

held.</P>

<P>The institute office in Caracas referred questions about the group to Washington, 

where a spokesman said the institute declined to comment on its work in Venezuela.</P>

<P>Another institute-sponsored activity, flying Chavez opponents to Washington 

to meet with US officials, may have accelerated the events leading to the coup.</P>

<P>During a trip in mid-March, less than a month before the uprising, Venezuelan 

participants said, US officials expressed support only for a constitutional departure 

for Chavez. </P>

<P>But Carvajal, the Education Assembly leader and one of the institute's invitees, 

said the trip helped to unite the opposition.</P>

<P>Within weeks after the trip, Carvajal said, the opposition ''precipitated'' 

its strategy, which previously had included a referendum on Chavez's rule followed 

by strikes to force his resignation. In early April, union and business leaders 

called the nationwide strike that culminated April 11 with street shootings and 

the coup.</p> </P>
