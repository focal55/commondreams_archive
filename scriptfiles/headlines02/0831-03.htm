<p>JOHANNESBURG   - Zimbabwe will not accept  genetically modified (GM) foodstuffs as part of mostly U.S. aid  shipments to its famine-threatened population, its agriculture  minister, Joseph Made, said on Saturday.<p>"We do not accept genetically modified material into  Zimbabwe," Made told Reuters in Johannesburg following the  arrival of President Robert Mugabe for the Earth Summit.<p>Of six southern African nations threatened by famine,  Zambia has also rejected GM grain. Most of it comes from the  United States, which is providing the bulk of food aid in the  region.<p>Zambia has said it shares European fears that GM is not  safe and wants its own scientists to probe the issue. Western  nations have accused Mugabe's government of hurting output in  southern Africa's "breadbasket" through land seizures from  white farmers.

<p>Asked if he was prepared to discuss the aid issue with U.S. officials at the 

Earth Summit, Made said: "There is nothing to discuss...You can't use the Zimbabwean 

population as guinea pigs...There is no way we can bring that material into Zimbabwe, 

which is a very clean environment."
