<p>Law professor and pro-Palestinian agitator Francis Boyle expected to have a 

lot of e-mail waiting for him after his two-and-a-half-week vacation. But he never 

imagined that there would be 55,000 messages packing his inbox -- many of them 

hurt, even belligerent, notes from friends and fellow activists. </p>

<p> Why, they wondered, had Boyle -- who appeared on national television last 

Sept. 13 to campaign against U.S. involvement in Afghanistan -- written "when 

I see in the newspapers that civilians in Afghanistan or the West Bank were killed 

by American or Israeli troops, I don't really care"?<droplinks> </p>

<p> The answer was simple. The message that supposedly came from Boyle was a forgery 

-- one of thousands sent out in the names and from e-mail addresses of prominent 

advocates for the Palestinians -- designed to sow dissension, create confusion 

and waste time in the activist community. </p>

<p> "Primarily, it's been a frustrating nuisance. But there have been a lot of 

angry misunderstandings, creating a lot of distraction," said Nigel Parry, co-founder 

of the <a href="http://electronicintifada.net" target="_new">Electronic Intifada</a> 

website. "Some people are closing accounts, others are getting off (activist e-mail) 

lists entirely." </p>

<p> Palestinian and Israeli hackers have been going after each other since the 

latest round of Middle East violence erupted in September 2000. But this tactic, 

e-mail identify theft -- known as a "Joe job" by spam experts -- is a new one, 

possibly the most disruptive yet. </p>

<p> Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois, spent 

nearly four days sifting through the messages, writing personal apologies to the 

offended and manually deleting thousands of bounce-backs. </p>

<p> Monica Tarazi, New York director of the <a href="http://www.adc.org" target="_new">American-Arab 

Anti-Discrimination Committee</a>, recently had her personal Yahoo e-mail account 

shut down for one day for spamming after a message bearing her name was sent to 

more than 80 Yahoo groups. </p>

<p> Yale medical school professor Mazin Qumsiyeh received dozens of e-mails from 

irate colleagues after messages he had written to a private list of activists 

were forwarded to more than 1,500 people in the Yale community without his knowledge. 

</p>

<p> The content of the impersonated e-mails has varied widely: news accounts of 

terrorist attacks; historical looks at the relationship between the United States 

and Jewish people; anti-Semitic rants; pro-Israel analysis. There have even been 

forged warnings that "the e-mails of the members of this group are hacked by pro-Israeli 

people." </p>

<p> Earlier this month, Tarazi and Parry discussed the problem with agents from 

the FBI's computer crimes and civil rights divisions in a half-hour conference 

call. But the FBI said there was little they could do to stop the e-mail impersonations 

from continuing. </p>

<p> "While these e-mails are a nuisance, offensive and intimidating, the FBI didn't 

find anything illegal: There haven't been threats that rise to the level of a 

hate crime, no money has been stolen, public safety has not been endangered and, 

as far as we can tell, our computers have not been hacked or 'technically intruded 

into' as one agent put it," Tarazi said in an e-mail. "The offensive messages 

are all protected by the First Amendment." </p>

<pagebreak> 

<p> Qumsiyeh was quick to blame "these Zionists" for the mimicry, saying in an 

e-mail that the FBI would have taken the case "seriously of course if the shoe 

was on the other foot, if you know what I mean." </p>

<p> The Palestinian movement is legendarily polarized. For example, in 1993 Boyle 

-- then the Palestinian delegation's legal adviser at the Middle East peace negotiations 

-- refused to attend the signing of the Oslo peace agreement on the White House 

lawn in part because he thought Arafat had caved in to the Israelis and Americans. 

</p>

<p> So it's not out of the question that this operation could be carried out by 

people within the pro-Palestinian community. </p>

<p> Jewish leaders like Abraham Foxman, national director of the <a href="http://www.adl.org" target="_new">Anti-Defamation 

League</a>, said that the e-mail impersonations of Qumsiyeh, Boyle and others 

were "absolutely improper" and that the events show "the Internet's dark underside 

(as) a vehicle for creating mischief and abuse." </p>

<p> These comments come despite the fact that Boyle has refused to condemn the 

killing of Israeli civilians by suicide bombers and once labeled Foxman's group 

a "dirty tricks organization for Israel." </p>

<p> "The Palestinian people are defending themselves and their land and their 

homes against Israeli war crimes and Israeli war criminals, both military and 

civilian," Boyle wrote in a recent issue of <I>The Link,</I> a pro-Arab journal. 

</p>

<p> According to Laura Atkins, president of the anti-spam group <a href="http://www.spamcon.org" target="_new">SpamCon 

Foundation</a>, several of the missives forged in Boyle's name were sent from 

a Kinko's in the St. Louis area. These were then routed through an e-mail server 

connected with <a href="http://www.arabwideweb.com" target="_new">Arab Wide Web</a>, 

a Middle Eastern news and culture website based in Dubai.</p>
