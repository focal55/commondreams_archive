BANFF, Alberta (Reuters) - 

The divisions between the world's

leading nations over the Kyoto protocol  on global warming deepened

dramatically on Sunday, when an informal discussion on climate

change ended in disarray with both the United States and Canada

looking increasingly isolated.

<p>



Washington has been relentlessly attacked since abandoning

Kyoto last year but after environment ministers from the Group of

Eight leading nations ended their 45-minute meeting it

was clear European leaders were fast losing patience with Canada's

dithering over whether to ratify the accord.

</font>Ottawa, which is under heavy pressure from energy producers and

several powerful provinces to follow the U.S. lead and ditch Kyoto,

has abandoned all talk of ratification this year and is calling for

more nationwide consultations.

<p>

Crucially, it also wants to be given more credit for exporting

clean energy to the United States as a way of meeting its Kyoto

target for cutting emissions of the greenhouse gases blamed for

global warming.

<p>

But both the European Union  and individual European nations --

who have been politely predicting Canada would ratify Kyoto soon --

said the idea of clean energy credits would wreck the protocol and

harshly made their displeasure known.

<p>

"My initial reaction is that if Canada now comes back to say we

have to reopen all the negotiations because we have seen the costs

are high -- that is not unique for Canada," said Margot Wallstrom,

the environment commissioner for the 15-nation European Union.

<p>

"We think this proposal...would actually completely change the

whole structure and architecture of the Kyoto protocol and this is

simply not acceptable to us," she told the closing news conference

after two days of talks as Canadian Environment Minister David

Anderson fumed in silence.

<p>

The European Union is especially unhappy about the Canadian

idea, given that Kyoto has already been changed once to give Canada

credit for the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by its large

forests.

<p>

But Anderson made clear that Ottawa would press ahead with

plans to formally present the clean energy proposal at a meeting in

Canada next month, saying he was not convinced by what the critics

had to say.

<p>

And he lost his temper when pressed repeatedly on Kyoto,

pointing out that the G8 ministers' meeting in the Rocky Mountain

resort town of Banff had formally been working on the agenda for a

major conference on sustainable development in Johannesburg this

August.

<p>

"A child dies every 10 seconds, every 10 seconds. Think how

many children have died since we began this press conference and

then say to me 'Keep talking about only one subject, only one

subject, only one subject and ignore everything else, including

those children who are dying'," he snapped.

<p>

The meeting was clearly something of a disaster for Anderson,

who lost another battle when G8 delegates overrode Canadian

objections and insisted there should be specific mention of Kyoto

ratification in the final protocol.

<p>

"They basically tried to duck the issue, they tried to keep it

off the agenda. Well, they failed," said Benedict Southworth, the

climate change director of Greenpeace.

<p>

"Fortunately the more progressive elements of the G8 have said

'No, you are going to talk about Kyoto. We are going to keep on

track'."

<p>

Some delegates said they suspected that Canada might even be

tempted to abandon Kyoto altogether over clean energy export

credits, a concept which attracted a steady drumbeat of disapproval

during the day.

<p>

"It is obvious that this is not an idea that has been thought

through to its real final consequences," German Environment

Minister Juergen Trittin told reporters.

<p>

Despite Canada's noted recent softening of its pro-Kyoto

stance, Anderson angrily insisted that "There has be no, no, no

change of position of the federal government of Canada" and

proceeded to accuse journalists of misquoting him.

<p>

Although the G8 ministers put less pressure than usual on

Christine Todd Whitman, the much-criticized head of the U.S.

Environmental Protection Agency, they made clear that President

George W. Bush's proposal to introduce voluntary guidelines for

emissions reductions were inadequate.

<p>

"We don't think what the United States is doing is enough. It

will be very little more than business as usual and allow emissions

to rise more than 30 percent," said Wallstrom.

<p>

"The basic problem is of course that the United States has

chosen to stand outside the Kyoto protocol. I hope we will be able

one day to convince them to come back into this process."

<p>

The G8 comprises Canada, Britain, the United States, Japan,

Italy, Germany, France and Russia.
