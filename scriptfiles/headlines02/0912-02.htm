<p>America's determination to topple Saddam Hussein has intensified the debate 

over enforcement of UN resolutions, reviving claims they are selectively targeted 

to reflect the political interests of the major powers. 

<P>Opponents of UN sanctions against Baghdad allege that Israel has been permitted 

to defy resolutions for the past 30 years ordering it to quit the West Bank and 

Gaza, while Iraq's non-compliance has been punished by repeated bombings and a 

rigorously enforced trade embargo. 

<P>President Bush's speech to the UN general assembly in New York today recognizes 

mounting international pressure for a fresh resolution against Iraq before any 

military action is taken. 

<P>His critics are unlikely to be persuaded. "The US has consistently employed 

a double standard when it comes to UN resolutions and international law," maintains 

<a href="http://www.vitw.org" target="_new">Voice in the Wilderness</a>, the campaign 

to end economic sanctions against Iraq. "For decades the US has vetoed UN resolutions 

condemning Israel's occupation of Arab territories." 

<P>Professor Malcolm Chalmers, who teaches international studies in the department 

of peace studies at Bradford University, agrees that UN resolutions reflect political 

relationships between permanent members of the security council and their allies. 

<P>"The way the security council works from the beginning is governed by its composition," 

he says. "In the case of Iraq the driving force is not what the United Nations 

said but what the major powers and the United States see as their priorities. 

<P>"There are other countries which have not complied with international treaties. 

Israel has been supported by America. It's a reflection of the modern world in 

which the US is the only power with the military might to enforce resolutions." 

<P>Sir Adam Roberts, professor of international relations at Oxford University, 

believes there is a fundamental difference between the UN's forthright condemnation 

of Iraq and its disapproval of Israel. "The comparison that is frequently made 

between Iraq's response to the resolutions relating to disarmament and Israel's 

responses to the resolutions about occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is a facile 

comparison," he says. 

<P>"The resolutions of the security council 242 and 338 call on all the parties 

to negotiate a peace settlement and it's perfectly possible to argue that serious 

attempts have been made ... and that responsibility for failure is not entirely 

Israel's fault. 

<P>"By contrast the resolutions on Iraq from 91 ... call unequivocally on Iraq 

to take certain actions and accept certain conditions as a quid pro quo for the 

ceasefire, and Iraq has been said quite clearly by the security council in 1998 

to be in 'flagrant violation' of various resolutions. That was unanimously passed 

by the security council in resolution 1205 of 98. Iraq is the only state the security 

council itself has said is in flagrant violation of its resolutions."</p>
