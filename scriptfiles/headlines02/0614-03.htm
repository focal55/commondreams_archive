<p>A world food summit ended 

in recrimination yesterday when it was branded a waste of time for everyone except 

the United States, which successfully sold genetically modified crops as a solution 

to famine. 

<P>The UN denied that the exercise in the Italian capital had been ineffective, 

despite the event being snubbed by western governments, complaints from leaders 

of developing countries and disagreements on strategies to avoid malnutrition 

and famine. 

<P>Environmental and agricultural groups accused the US of steamrollering the 

summit into approving biotechnology, after robust lobbying by Washington. 

<P>"The US played very hard and succeeded. They now have the moral authority to 

use genetically modified food for aid purposes," said Fernando Almansa of Oxfam. 

<P>He hoped the defeat would shock opponents of GM food into mobilizing for the 

UN summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in August. 

<P>The US delegation was led by the agriculture secretary, Ann Veneman, and made 

no secret that its priority was to promote the wider use of biotechnology, an 

industry dominated by American companies. 

<P>"Biotechnology has tremendous potential to develop products that can be more 

suited to areas of the world where there is persistent hunger," Ms Veneman said. 

"There is no food safety issue whatsoever." 

<P>Another delegate was more forthright: "We're here to sell biotech, and that's 

what we've done." 

<P>Advocates say GM crops with improved yields, resistance to drought and tolerance 

of salt could ease food shortages in stricken areas. But critics say it could 

destroy biodiversity and force poor farmers to buy seeds from US corporations. 

<P>Fred Kalibwani, an ecology activist from a Zimbabwe-based non-governmental 

organization, said that the patented GM seeds in effect placed food security in 

the hands of a few corporations. "This will be tragic for Africa in the next few 

years," he said. 

<P>Jacques Diouf, director general of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization 

which hosted the summit, said the event was a success because it reaffirmed the 

pledge of a 1996 food summit to halve world hunger by 2015. 

<P>But little headway has been made in the past six years: more than 800 million 

people are still hungry, famine is looming in southern Africa and a request for 

an extra &#163;16bn each year fell flat. 

<P>Some 181 countries were represented, but of the 74 heads of state or government, 

only two were from the west. South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, accused the 

west of indifference. 

<P>Clare Short, Britain's secretary of state for international development, said 

the summit was a waste of time, and the EU's aid commissioner, Poul Nielson, accused 

organizers of trying to build an empire rather than tackling the real problem 

of hunger. 

<P>Other delegations expressed frustration they were unable to address western 

leaders about the damage their tariffs inflict on poor farmers. 

<P>Some UN officials said the &#163;1.6m cost of the event would have been better 

spent on grain for the poor. </p>
