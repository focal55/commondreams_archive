<p>WASHINGTON - 

In the months before the Sept. 11

attacks, the Bush administration received intelligence that

Osama bin Laden  could be plotting to hijack U.S. aircraft,

prompting it to put security agencies on alert, the White House

said on Wednesday.

<p>

"The information the president got dealt with hijackings in

the traditional sense, not suicide bombers, not using planes as

missiles," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer  said of the

intelligence, which was presented to President Bush last

summer.

<p>

Fleischer said the information prompted the administration

to put domestic law enforcement agencies on alert, though it

was not announced publicly.

<p>

"The administration, based on hijackings, notified the

appropriate agencies and, I think, that's one of the reasons

that you saw that the people who committed the 9/11 attacks

used box cutters and plastic knives to get around America's

system of protecting against hijackings," Fleischer said.

<p>

The disclosure followed reports that an FBI  agent urged the

bureau to investigate Middle Eastern men enrolled in U.S.

flight schools several months before Sept. 11, even naming bin

Laden, who Washington later accused of masterminding the

attacks.

<p>

When four hijacked airliners plowed into the World Trade

Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania on Sept. 11,

Middle Eastern men trained at U.S. flight schools were at the

controls. The attacks killed more than 3,000 people and

destroyed the World Trade Center.

<p>

Fleischer said Bush had been given general information

about the threat of hijackings by bin Laden. "That was

information that has been known and the president was informed

of it," he said.

<p>

But Fleischer would not discuss specific information Bush

received during his daily intelligence briefings. "We don't

discuss the president's morning briefings as a matter of

policy," Fleischer said.

<p>

"I will say that there has been long-standing speculation,

which was shared with the president, about the potential of

hijackings in the traditional sense ... I've also indicated

that we've had threatens involving bin Laden around the world,

and including in the United States," Fleischer said.
