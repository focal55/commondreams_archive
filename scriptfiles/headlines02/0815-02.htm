<p> WASHINGTON -- An army may still travel on its stomach, but a vital point of 

attack these days is the brain -- the electronic brain.</p>

<p>With modern warfare so dependent on computers and communications devices, a 

weapon that renders them useless could be invaluable. And after decades of research, 

U.S. scientists and engineers may be close to fielding an effective technology 

known as high-powered microwave weapons.</p>

<p>At least, that is the latest buzz. Recent articles have speculated microwave 

weapons could be deployed if the United States invades Iraq. But some experts 

-- including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- say considerable work remains.</p>

<p>"It's been this elegant promise for decades that never quite seems to happen," 

said John Alexander, author of "Future War: Non-Lethal Weapons in Twenty-First 

Century Warfare" and a retired Army colonel who directed non-lethal weapons development 

at Los Alamos National Laboratory. "The check's always in the mail."</p>

<p>The concept behind high-powered microwave weapons is simple. A burst of electromagnetic 

energy is created and directed at an enemy's electronics. The force burns them 

out much like a lightning strike can destroy home appliances.</p>

<p>Challenges, though, lie in a number of areas, according to several experts.</p>

<p>For example, delivering the weapons would likely be done by cruise missiles 

or unmanned aerial vehicles to help get close to the target. That requires making 

the weapons not only high powered, but also rugged and relatively small, which 

Air Force Col. Eileen Walling labeled "extremely challenging and technically difficult" 

in a paper she wrote in 2000 on the weapons.</p>

<p>Alexander explained another problem: unpredictability, even when everything 

goes right.</p>

<p>"Electrical components are really rather tricky," he said. "You can put the 

same amount of energy into 10 identical targets and you can destroy two of them, 

upset five of them and, in three of them, nothing happens."</p>

<p>High-powered microwave weapons are one component of a broader category known 

as directed energy weapons that includes lasers.</p>

<p>"When people are talking about high-powered microwave weapons, they're not 

talking about a single device like the stealth bomber," said John Pike, director 

of globalsecurity.org, a Washington-area policy organization seeking to reduce 

reliance on nuclear weapons. "Rather, they're talking about a physical principle 

and an effect which can be generated a number of different ways for a number of 

different purposes."</p>

<p>Most of the Defense Department's work on high-powered microwave weapons takes 

place at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, N.M..</p>

<p>"We are looking at different sources and devices that can produce that microwave 

energy and propel it," said Rich Garcia, a spokesman for the project where nearly 

all of the work is classified.</p>

<p>Researchers also are exploring ways to block incoming high-powered microwave 

weapons. That will require something of a super surge protector, experts point 

out, because the blasts are so intense and brief they can escape detection.</p>

<p>The former Soviet Union once was deeply involved in exploring high-powered 

microwave weapons, but it is now thought Russia is no longer pursuing them. Other 

nations believed to be conducting research are China, Great Britain and France.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the widely respected magazine Aviation Week & Space Technology 

printed an article stating that "an attack on Iraq is expected to see the first 

use of high-power microwave weapons..."</p>

<p>The New York Post, citing unnamed U.S. military officials, reported yesterday 

that a preliminary Iraq battle plan "outlined for President Bush last week calls 

for the most extensive use of electronic and psychological warfare in history 

-- including secret new electromagnetic pulse weapons to disable Saddam (Hussein)'s 

entire command and control structure."</p> </p>
