<p> It is more than 50 years since India and Pakistan achieved independence from 

Britain, and since then the two South Asian nations have argued and squabbled 

-- incessantly and sometimes bloodily -- over the contested state of Kashmir.

</table>The possibility that the conflict could go nuclear has haunted the region since 

1974, when India first detonated an atomic bomb in response to China's development 

of nuclear weapons a decade earlier. In 1972, Pakistan began a nuclear weapons 

program shortly after its loss of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in a war with 

India. 

<P>If a nuclear war between the two countries broke out, millions of survivors 

might be disabled, blinded or deafened by the nuclear thunderclaps. Radioactive 

fallout might poison soil and rivers and crops across South Asia and points beyond. 

A new Dark Age of political chaos -- exploited by religious demagogues, high-tech 

warlords and neighboring powers with their own strategic ambitions -- might descend 

upon these impoverished lands. 

<P>As to how many warheads each side has, in addition to conventional forces, 

estimates vary. 

<P>

<P><b>Assessing Countries' Bombmaking Abilities</b>

<P>India's known plutonium reserves indicate it has the potential to assemble 

at least 65 weapons, according to veteran defense analyst Anthony Cordesman of 

the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. In theory, India 

and Pakistan could make even more bombs through clever designs and miniaturization 

techniques, similar to those the United States and Soviet Union developed during 

the Cold War to "get more bang for the buck," as the nation's weapons designers 

loved to say. In 1998, Indian officials said they had enough fissile material 

to make 125 bombs. Other Western estimates go as high as 200 Indian warheads. 

<P>Pakistan has enough weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium to assemble up to 

25 bombs, according to analysts at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 

Also, Pakistan's heavy-water research reactor at Khushab, which was completed 

in the mid-1990s, is "estimated to be capable of generating enough plutonium for 

between one and two nuclear weapons annually," Cordesman notes. 

<P>Fallout from nuclear blasts could travel hundreds or thousands of miles, even 

around the world, depending on prevailing winds, weather conditions and how close 

to the ground the blasts occur. Low-altitude blasts, which are more likely to 

destroy hardened targets such as bunkers, could boost mountains of "radioactivated" 

dirt into the sky. The resulting fallout could rain across Asia, spoiling farmland 

across an overpopulated continent already desperate for every inch of tillable 

soil. 

<P>

<P><b>Fallout May Spare Americas, Europe</b>

<P>Even if winds blew fallout around the world, however, the radioactivity would 

be so diluted it would have negligible health impact on Europe and the Americas, 

some experts say. 

<P>"Neither side seems to pay (in) public much attention to factors like fallout, 

collateral damage from inaccurate strikes, and problems with reliable calculation 

of height of burst," Cordesman notes in "The India-Pakistan Military Balance," 

a report he recently wrote for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

As a result, the report said, "Either side could launch a strike with far more 

civilian casualties than it planned, triggering a much higher level of retaliatory 

escalation than it intended." 

<P>Western analysts are divided, though, on whether the India-Pakistan conflict 

is a nuclear disaster in the making or an overblown crisis. 

<P>Each side's apparent confidence that it can militarily and politically navigate 

through the quarrel without plunging into an atomic abyss is justified, according 

to some experts, who accuse Westerners of underestimating the maturity and sophistication 

of the Pakistani and Indian leaders. 

<P>"There is almost a racist tendency to depict these guys as a bunch of mango 

republic nut jobs, and they aren't," says one high-placed U.S. analyst, referring 

to Indian and Pakistani leaders. The analyst, who has extensive field experience 

in Pakistan, declined to be identified. 

<P>Still, surprise shocks can ruin politicians' best-laid plans, transforming 

semi-stable regional tensions into bloody cataclysms, just as the assassination 

of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 hurled Europe into World War I, other observers 

warn. 

<P>"The dynamics of the situation could overcome the carefully scripted plans 

of the political leaders if there's one (more) major terrorist attack" on India 

by militants operating out of Pakistan or the Pakistani-run sector of Kashmir, 

warns Joseph Cirincione, director of the nonproliferation project at the Carnegie 

Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. 

<P>"I'm very pessimistic," Cirincione adds. "Unless the United States can delay 

this for two more weeks, I think we're going to go to war, and it has a very high 

probability of going nuclear." 

<P>Analysts believe the next few weeks are decisive because India is unlikely 

to take military action after the summer monsoon season starts in late June. The 

seasonal rains would make it difficult to move troops and equipment through the 

mountainous terrain of Kashmir. 

<P>Defense strategists in India, which has by far the greater conventional military 

might, have discussed several major options including: 

<ul>

<li>A "salami strategy" in which the Indian army would incrementally seize slices, 

or small pieces, of Pakistani territory. Then the Indian government would use 

these "slices" as pawns in peace negotiations, promising to return the territory 

in return for Pakistani concessions.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>Making bold strikes against Pakistani military bases. One problem with trying 

to obliterate these bases in Pakistan is that the Indian forces might well obliterate 

U.S. military forces stationed at these bases in connection with al Qaeda opposition 

operations in Afghanistan.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>Launching conventional air raids against Pakistan from Indian aircraft carriers 

positioned in the Indian Ocean. Having a much weaker navy, Pakistan would have 

trouble responding directly to such attacks. </li>

</ul>

<P>

<P><b>Pakistan Already 'A Failing State'</b>

<P>The trouble with such Indian schemes is that they must succeed without oversucceeding. 

That's because Pakistan is already politically unstable, held together mainly 

by its army, according to some Western experts. If Pakistan collapsed under a 

crushing Indian onslaught, then there'd be no entity left to control Pakistani 

guerrillas just beyond India's border -- unless India itself took on that task. 

<P>Pakistan already is "what people mean by a failing state," Cirincione says. 

"If there is no Pakistani government, then there's nobody to crack down on and 

there'll be an increase in terrorist attacks" against India. Thereafter, for India, 

"it starts to look a lot like Vietnam." 

<P>And that raises the specter of nuclear war: If Pakistan thinks its survival 

is threatened, its surviving leaders, whether civilian or military, might deploy 

nuclear weapons as desperate last-minute defenses. 

<P>In recent years, Western analysts have conducted many computer-assisted scenarios 

about hypothetical India-Pakistan nuclear wars. These "war games" simulate conventional 

and nuclear conflicts. 

<P>One such scenario was described in a report co-written in the late 1990s by 

David Shlapak, an international policy analyst at the Rand think tank whose experience 

with war gaming goes back to the Cold War. The report depicts a hypothetical India-Pakistan 

war that breaks out in 2005. Participants in the scenario "gamed" what happened 

next. They based their actions on their knowledge of the region and its leadership. 

<P>Here's what they anticipated: "In the spring of 2006, India dramatically increases 

its counterinsurgency operations in both Kashmir and Punjab, and the rebels are 

pushed into precipitate retreat," the Rand report says. "Pakistan responds by 

infiltrating a number of special forces teams, which attack military installations 

supporting the Indian operations. 

<P>"India mobilizes for war," the report continues, "and launches major attacks 

all along the international border, accompanied by an intense air campaign. . 

. . As Indian forces continue to press forward, Pakistan detonates a small fission 

(nuclear) bomb on an Indian armored formation in an unpopulated area of the desert 

border region; it is unclear whether the weapon was intended to go off over Pakistani 

or Indian territory. 

<P>"India responds by destroying a Pakistani air base with a two-weapon nuclear 

attack. Condemning the 'escalation' to homeland attacks, Pakistan attacks the 

Indian city of Jodhpur with a 20-kiloton weapon and demands cessation of hostilities." 

<P>Then "India strikes Hyderabad with a weapon estimated to be 200 kilotons and 

threatens 10 times more destruction if any more nuclear weapons are used. Pakistan 

offers a cease-fire in place." The war game ends shortly after the cease-fire. 

<P>The report doesn't estimate the likely number of deaths in such a war. Some 

other scenarios have estimated the number of dead in an India-Pakistan war at 

up to 17 million. 

<P>The report also details the extreme difficulty of post-atomic war Western humanitarian 

efforts in the region, where the atomic blasts have rendered many air fields inaccessible. 

<P>

<P><b>Media Accused of Overplaying Threat</b>

<P>Are such frightening scenarios overblown, though? 

<P>"This whole thing about nuclear conflict is overplayed. The Western media feeds 

on the frenzy," charges an Indian-born analyst, Gaurav Kampani, a research associate 

at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International 

Studies in Monterey. He was speaking of Western speculation about a South Asian 

nuclear war in general and not referring to any specific nuclear scenarios. 

<P>Even if Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is overthrown, he probably wouldn't 

be replaced by grossly irresponsible leaders, Kampani says. "I don't see the plausibility 

of hard-liners replacing him. Pakistan is economically bankrupt. It's surviving 

on handouts from IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank. It is politically 

isolated and under a spotlight. So it would be very foolish for hard-liners to 

replace Musharraf." 

<P>In interviews with The Chronicle, other analysts depicted the "crisis" as a 

kind of publicity stunt by the Indians. As the analysts see it, the Indians hope 

that by rattling their nuclear sabers, they'll scare the United States into insisting 

that Musharraf rein in the militants. 

<P>If that was the Indians' plan, then they've apparently succeeded: By early 

this week, according to news reports, U.S. officials informed the Indians that 

Musharraf had promised he'd take action. Russian leader Vladimir Putin is trying 

to bring about face-to-face discussion between Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister 

Atal Behari Vajpayee, so far unsuccessfully. At an international conference this 

week, the two men refused to acknowledge each other's presence although they sat 

only a short distance apart. 

<P>"I personally think this nuclear issue is blown well out of proportion," says 

Chris Fair, an associate political scientist at Rand's headquarters in Santa Monica. 

"It's more stable than you'd think. . . . Pakistan well knows that if it were 

to use its nuclear weapons and India were to retaliate (with nuclear bombs), Pakistan 

would never be able to recover." 

<P>Even if the Indians' and Pakistanis' nuclear bombast is strictly for show, 

though, it might boomerang, some Western critics warn. 

<P>"The problem is not one of Indian or Pakistani leaders being 'irrational' in 

any way. I think they are as rational as any American or (Soviet) leader was during 

the Cold War," says Scott Sagan, co-director of Stanford's Center for International 

Security and Cooperation. 

<P>Rather, "the problem is they have found themselves locked into a crisis where 

it will not be easy for either side to back down at this point," Sagan says. Hence, 

"I'm extremely worried . . . I think it's the most dangerous nuclear situation 

the world has seen since the Cuban missile crisis" 40 years ago this autumn. 

<P>The crisis is a long-term relic of the collapse of British imperial power in 

the region more than a half-century ago. Their coffers and manpower exhausted 

after World War II, British forces departed the region in relative haste. They 

left behind leadership vacuums, confused borders and ethnic rivalries that seethe 

to this day -- especially in the contested state of Kashmir between India and 

Pakistan. 

<P>In the latest episode of the Kashmir melodrama, India is furious over the repeated 

militant attacks on its soil. These include a murderous assault on its Parliament 

in New Delhi in December. 

<P>Pakistan's defenders insist that most or all of the terrorists are rogue elements 

beyond Musharraf's control. Besides, they charge, India has invited the attacks 

by suppressing democratic freedoms in the Indian-run sector of Kashmir. 

<P>India's conventional military muscle is greater than Pakistan's: India's "military 

expenditures have recently been 3 to 5 times higher," Cordesman says. 

<P>India "has a much larger defense industrial base, can manufacture and assemble 

more advanced arms, and gets most of its arms from Russia. . . . Pakistan imports 

most of its arms from China and Eastern Europe and they are notably less advanced 

than those imported by India." 

<P>

<P><b>Pakistan's Terrorists Present Wild Card</b>

<P>Even so, India's conventional muscle could be of little use in deterring attacks 

by terrorist bands, which roam and hide with near impunity in the mountain ranges 

of the contested Kashmir borders. 

<P>In any case, Musharraf has limited room to maneuver, Cirincione says. "My opinion 

is (Musharraf) doesn't control these groups. But like (Palestinian leader Yasser) 

Arafat, he's afraid that if he cracks down, they could topple him. . . . (In Pakistan), 

there's a perception (among many Muslims) that he has abandoned Afghanistan. If 

he's now perceived as abandoning Kashmir, he may be committing political suicide." 

<P>And if Musharraf falls, who replaces him? More importantly, into whose hands 

will Pakistan's military -- and its nuclear weapons -- fall? 

<P>"Right now, the weapons are under very tight control by the (Pakistani) army," 

Cirincione says. "But if the army disintegrates, who's controlling those weapons? 

Where are their loyalties? There'd be a very high risk those weapons could fall 

into terrorist hands." 

<P>The Indians and Pakistanis can learn a few things from the U.S.-Soviet Cold 

War experience, says Michael May, former director of Lawrence Livermore National 

Laboratory. 

<P>One lesson, May says, "is the importance of communicating," as U.S. and Soviet 

leaders did via the famous "hot line" telephone. Recently, "I was troubled by 

the refusal of the Indian leader to talk to his (Pakistani) counterpart. It's 

important to communicate during a crisis."</p>
