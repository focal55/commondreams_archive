<p> BAGHDAD - President Saddam Hussein told Iraq's parliament in a message broadcast 

on Saturday that he had decided to accept the terms of a harsh U.N. resolution 

to disarm to avert a U.S. attack.

<p>The Iraqi leader said he hoped this decision would prove  that Baghdad was not concealing any weapons of mass  destruction.<p>In a letter addressed to parliament, Saddam said he had  mulled the MPs' recommendation that Baghdad reject the  resolution, but had chosen to allow the weapons inspectors back  to undermine the United States and foil its plans for war.<p>"We hope that the method we have used will achieve the  stated aim of those with no evil intentions in the Security  Council, and that is that they know the truth as it is: Iraq is  devoid of weapons of mass destruction, and they can now work on  ending the embargo and the tyrannical sanctions."<p>Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix said in Paris on  Saturday that the inspections will begin on November 27, and  warned Saddam to disclose all his weapons of mass destruction.<p>Saddam's letter, dated November 12, was read out by the  National Assembly speaker at Saturday's parliamentary session.  It was also broadcast on Iraqi TV and carried by the state-run  Iraqi news agency INA.<p>In it, Saddam told MPs he had decided to allow the  inspectors to return because "your enemy, the Zionist coalition  with the American administration, and all those devils that  follow them, have chosen this time, after sabre rattling...to  fight our heroic and struggling people."<p>The Iraqi parliament had recommended Saddam reject the U.N.  resolution but left the final say to him. Many Iraqis, weary  from two wars in two decades, were relieved Saddam accepted the  resolution ordering Iraq to disarm, saying it could avert a  war.<p>U.N. resolution 1441, adopted on November 8, gives Baghdad  one last chance to disarm and cooperate with U.N. weapons  inspectors or face "serious consequences."<p>Saddam said in his letter he hoped his actions would lead  to "ending all kinds of interference in Iraq's affairs,  respecting its sovereignty, independence and security."<p>Iraq, he said, will continue to adhere to both its rights  and commitments according to the U.N. declaration and  international law.<p>But he sounded a warning that "if the tyrants continue  their tyranny, then all of you know that we have enough  revolutionary capabilities against tyranny and tyrants that  will make them be disappointed, God willing."<p>Iraq, once a leading oil exporter, is reeling under a harsh  sanctions regime imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.<p>Iraq's official media on Saturday said that the U.N.  weapons inspections will prove once and for all that Baghdad  has no weapons of mass destruction.<p>The papers, which reflect official thinking, also heaped  scorn on President Bush's administration, accusing it of  wanting to strike Iraq under any pretext.<p>The media praised Saddam for averting an imminent showdown  by accepting the resolution to submit to new arms inspections  that were broken off four years ago.<p>TRIGGER FOR ATTACK<p>The Security Council will also have to ensure that the rest  of the Middle East should have no weapons of mass destruction,  the papers said. This applied in particular to Israel, as laid  down by U.N. resolution 687 on the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire.<p>The latest U.N. resolution on Iraq says any false  information in Baghdad's declaration and non-cooperation with  weapons inspectors would constitute a "material breach" --  legal terminology that could trigger a U.S. attack against  Baghdad.<p>The actions of the new inspection teams will be the test of  their credibility, "which dictates they should be professional  and precise," said al-Jumhouriya daily, adding that the truth  of Iraq's insistence that it has absolutely no nuclear,  chemical or biological weapons will then be clear.

<p>But the Iraqi newspapers accused Washington of racing against time to launch 

military action against Iraq. "America wants war at any price and under any pretext," 

al-Iraq said.
