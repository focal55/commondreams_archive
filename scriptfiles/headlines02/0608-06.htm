<p>MADISON, Wis.  - 

Former U.S. Vice President Al

Gore  on Saturday criticized President Bush  for refusing to

accept a federal agency report that blames humans for global

warming.

<p>



The recently released Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

report appeared to back the view of many scientists who believe

global warming is caused mainly by emissions from automobiles,

power plants, and oil refineries.

<p>

Bush appeared to dismiss the report, calling it a product

of bureaucracy, and said he would continue to press for

voluntary efforts and financial incentives for U.S. companies

to reduce emissions.

<p>

Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee and a

champion of environmental protection as vice president, said

the president had succumbed to powerful interests that run the

Republican Party and rejected the report rather than accept it

and do something about global warming.

<p>

"That's not a moral choice," Gore said. "I don't want to

hear from this bunch: 'We didn't know'."

<p>

Gore has questioned Bush's policies on the economy,

environment and values in previous appearances since emerging

from a year of political seclusion in February. He has not said

whether he will make another run at the White House in 2004.

<p>

The Bush administration has put "lobbyists for the

polluters in charge of policies" and put "the hungriest fox

they could find" to guard government henhouses, Gore said.

<p>

The Bush administration had repeatedly emphasized that

there was not enough scientific evidence to link global warming

to industrial emissions and has refused to sign the Kyoto

Treaty, which seeks to reduce worldwide atmospheric emissions.

<p>

The State Department has submitted the report by the EPA,

whose top officials are appointed by the president, to the

United Nations.

<p>

Republicans want to turn their back on the environment

rather than embrace new technologies that can clean up the

environment and create jobs, Gore said.

<p>

"It is our moral responsibility and it's our economic

opportunity,' Gore said.
