Two Israeli reserve soldiers are to be jailed for 28 days for refusing to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<P>

The sentence, decided by their battalion commanders, comes a day after another reservist soldier was jailed for a similar term, for abandoning an army road block in the West Bank.

<P>

The pair had signed a petition backed by a growing number of Israeli soldiers objecting to serving in areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.

<P>

They are the first of the signatories to be imprisoned over the petition, which has prompted heated debate in Israel.

<P>

The movement behind the petition - called "There is a Choice " - denounced the sentence and said the protest action would continue, according to Israel's centre-left Ha'aretz newspaper.

<P>

Israeli police are considering charging soldiers who disobey orders to serve in the disputed territories with inciting revolt, the newspaper reported.

<P>

The soldiers who were jailed were named as 31-year-old Staff Sergeant Amit Gal, from a parachute regiment, and Sergeant Major O M, 27, from an armoured unit.

<P>

They refused to report for duty after being called up for "operational duties".

<P>



<B>Opinion divided</B>

<P>

Ha'aretz quoted one of the movement's members, Amit Mashiach, as saying: "Amit [Gal] begged his commanders not to send him to the territories and to find something for him to do within the Green Line [Israel's pre-1967 borders]."



"He wants to serve the country, but is not willing to go against his conscience." 

<P>



The petition began on 25 January, when 52 soldiers signed the declaration.

<P>

Since then, nearly 300 dissenters have pledged their support.

<P>

The controversial document has sparked a fierce debate in Israel, with the army saying it could jeopardise the security of the Jewish state.
