President Bill Clinton will make his preference for his former chief fund-raiser over his former Labor secretary clear today. Making an unusual foray into a state party primary contest, the former president will bring his star power and media coverage when he appears alongside Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steven Grossman at Grossman's Somerville paper factory.



<P>Grossman, a longtime contributor to the Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee chief in 1997 and 1998, has often said he considers Clinton a personal friend. </P>

<P>Earlier in the gubernatorial campaign, when former US Labor secretary and Grossman rival Robert B. Reich said Clinton had been encouraging about his candidacy, Grossman took pains to point out that Clinton had offered to use his considerable clout on Grossman's behalf. Recently, Clinton himself took the extraordinary step of weighing in, telling a Globe columnist he would ''never'' support Reich over Grossman.</P>

<P>Grossman has long said that Clinton supports his candidacy and had promised to come to Massachusetts  on his behalf. His campaign manager, Colleen McGee, said yesterday she wasn't sure if the former president would issue a formal endorsement of Grossman's candidacy, but said she expected some very warm words from him.</P>

<P>Clinton will also speak at Tufts University this afternoon.</P>
