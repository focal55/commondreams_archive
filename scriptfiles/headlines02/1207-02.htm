<p>SAN FRANCISCO - A federal appeals court, upholding California's assault-weapons ban, decided that the Second Amendment does not guarantee individuals the right to bear arms.

<P>



   The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling Thursday conflicts with Attorney General John Ashcroft's interpretation of the Second Amendment and with a 2001 ruling by the federal Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

<P>



   The decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the right to bear arms is intended to maintain effective state militias and is not an individual right.

<P>



   ''The historical record makes it equally plain that the amendment was not adopted in order to afford rights to individuals with respect to private gun ownership or possession,'' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote.

<P>



   Andrew Arulanandam, spokesman for the National Rifle Association, said it was too early to know how Thursday's ruling will affect the gun-rights debate. 

<P>



   ''For 131 years we've been standing steadfastly to protect the freedoms of all law abiding Americans and stand steadfastly that the Second Amendment is an individual right - and [we] will continue to do so,'' Arulanandam said.

<P>



   The amendment reads, in full: ''A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' 

<P>



   In its ruling last year, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, said that the Second Amendment does protect an individual's right to bear arms but that those rights are subject to narrowly tailored restrictions.

<P>



   Ashcroft has said that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to bear arms, prompting a flood of defendants to petition federal judges to vacate their weapons convictions. Many of those cases are on appeal.

<P>



   Attorneys for the gun owners who sued in the case decided Thursday did not return telephone calls seeking comment on whether they would appeal to the US Supreme Court. 

<P>



   In Thursday's case, weapons owners challenged 1999 amendments to a California law passed in 1989 that outlawed 75 high-powered weapons. 

<P>



   The initial law, enacted in response to a 1989 schoolyard shooting in Stockton in which five children were killed and 30 were wounded, banned certain makes and models of firearms. The amendments banned additional ''copycat'' weapons based on a host of features.
