<p>Diane MacPherson, of Lowell, Mass., lost her job at a relocation management 

company last November, and with it the health insurance for herself, her husband 

and their 4-year-old daughter. Her husband works in construction and does not 

have access to health care coverage at work.</p>

<P> Continuing her family health insurance under the federal Cobra program would 

have cost $931 a month, so the couple decided to insure only their daughter, at 

a cost of $270 a month. Two months ago, when Ms. MacPherson's unemployment compensation 

payments ran out, they dropped their health insurance altogether. Although her 

husband earns about $75,000 a year, construction work is seasonal and they could 

not be assured of enough income every month to pay for health insurance.</p>

<P> Then their daughter came down with strep throat. "That was rather humiliating, 

being in the doctor's office without insurance," Ms. MacPherson said. "You become 

very obvious to everyone."</p>

<P> The family represents a changing portrait of the 41 million Americans who 

do not have health insurance today. Once thought to be a problem chiefly of the 

poor and the unemployed, the health care crisis is spreading up the income ladder 

and deep into the ranks of those with full-time jobs.</p>

<P> According to recently released Census Bureau figures, 1.4 million Americans 

lost their health insurance last year, an increase largely attributed to the economic 

slowdown and resulting rise in unemployment. The largest group of the newly uninsured 

— some 800,000 people — had incomes in excess of $75,000. They either lost their 

jobs, or were priced out of the health care market by rapidly rising insurance 

premiums, or, like Ms. MacPherson, both.</p>

<P> While it is true that the number of uninsured people rises when unemployment 

goes up, it is also true that the rolls of the uninsured can expand even when 

joblessness is going down, as it did through most of the 1990's.</p>

<P> The numbers of uninsured during the last recession from 1990-92 jumped to 

35.4 million from 32.9 million. But the number continued to rise even in the boom 

years of the mid- to late 1990's, reaching 40.7 million in 1998 before dipping 

slightly in 1999 and 2000.</p>

<P> Labor economists say that much of the job growth during the expansion of the 

1990's came in small businesses and in service industries, low-wage, nonunion 

sectors that are much less likely to offer health insurance as a benefit to new 

workers. There was also a demographic bulge of young people and recent immigrants 

entering the work force during the decade, with many of them willing to take jobs 

that did not offer rich benefit packages.</p>

<P> The problem has long been acute among minorities, immigrants, part-time workers 

and employees in low-wage service jobs. What is different this time, analysts 

say, is that the problem is hitting middle-income and upper-income families harder 

because many of the job losses are in high-wage industries like technology and 

telecommunications.</p>

<P> Thirty million Americans in working families today — 16 percent of all those 

in families headed by a worker — lack health care coverage, according to a four-year 

tracking study by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research 

group financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. An additional 16 million 

Americans — mostly low-income workers — are offered health insurance through their 

jobs but decline because they get health care from government programs or it is 

too expensive, the study found.</p>

<P> "The failure of the economic boom to expand employer-based coverage for working 

families significantly is ominous," the center said in a recent study. It found 

that the current slowdown and the rising cost of providing health care to employees 

produced a double whammy: fewer companies are now willing to offer their workers 

health care coverage, and those that do will demand that employees shoulder a 

far higher share of the cost.</p>

<P> <strong> Rising Concerns</strong></p>

<P> Policy makers and health care analysts say the United States is again confronting 

a crisis in its medical delivery system. </p>

<P> "The number of uninsured will continue to grow as long as health insurance 

premiums rise more rapidly than earnings, as they have for a decade," said Drew 

E. Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health 

coverage trends.</p>

<P> "Losing health benefits is becoming a middle-class issue," Mr. Altman said. 

"If it had not been for expansions in the child health program and Medicaid, we 

would have 10 million more uninsured."</p>

<P> The growing number of uninsured and the rising cost of health insurance have 

stimulated Congressional interest on a scale not seen since 1993 and 1994, when 

President Bill Clinton tried to remake the health care system and guarantee coverage 

for all Americans.</p>

<P> The major proposals being debated now fall into two main categories. One approach, 

favored by Republicans and some Democrats, would provide tax breaks to help individuals, 

families and small businesses buy health insurance in the open market. The other, 

preferred by many Democrats, would expand eligibility for Medicaid or the Children's 

Health Insurance Program to include the parents of some children who are already 

eligible.</p>

<P> Either plan could have eased the situation of Brian and Anna Brooks, who run 

a small electrical contracting business in Westminster, Colo. They gave up their 

health insurance for themselves and their 8-year-old daughter this year to keep 

their business afloat.</p>

<P> They had already let go four of their five workers and wanted to maintain 

health coverage for their remaining employee.</p>

<P> Ms. Brooks said that they dropped their health coverage in July after the 

family premium jumped to $989 a month from $489 a month. Business was slow, and 

their previous income of more than $60,000 a year had fallen by half.</p>

<P> The effect has been immediate. Mr. Brooks, 50, has stopped taking Lipitor 

to control high cholesterol and has started taking over-the-counter herbal supplements. 

Ms. Brooks no longer takes Singulair for asthma and has adopted an exercise program 

intended to regulate her breathing. Ms. Brooks estimates they are saving $150 

a month by not using prescription drugs.</p>

<P> "We changed our diets a lot in order to help the effectiveness of the supplements, 

and maybe that's a good thing," she said. They are setting aside $30 a month for 

their daughter's medical needs, but one ear infection would quickly empty the 

pot.</p>

<P> The federal Cobra program, enacted as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget 

Reconciliation Act of 1986, is devised to provide a cushion for those who have 

recently lost their jobs. It allows workers to maintain their health care coverage 

for up to 18 months if they assume the full cost of the health coverage provided 

by their former employer. But many find the cost prohibitive, and only a quarter 

of workers say they would keep up their coverage under Cobra because of its high 

cost, according to a new survey from the Commonwealth Fund, a private research 

group.</p>

<P> <strong>Betting on Good Health</strong></p>

<P> The high cost of Cobra coverage presents many people who have recently been 

laid off with a cruel choice. Audrey Robar of Milwaukee, 63, who lost her job 

at a private social services agency in September, decided to skip the $300 a month 

Cobra package in the expectation that she would soon find another job.</p>

<P> It was a gamble, and she lost.</p>

<P> "She was thinking she could get away with it," her daughter, Eva Robar-Orlich, 

said in an interview last week.</p>

<P> In the early hours of Oct. 23, Ms. Robar began to suffer chest pain and dizziness. 

She called her sister to ask whether she could seek medical care immediately and 

sign up for Cobra later. Her sister, Alden Egan, urged her to call an ambulance 

right away, but Ms. Robar set down the phone to look for the Cobra documents. 

Ms. Egan then heard over the open phone line the sound of her sister falling to 

the floor and quickly called 911. By the time paramedics arrived a few minutes 

later, Ms. Robar was dead of a heart attack.</p>

<P> "I think the fact that she hadn't paid for Cobra very well could have cost 

her her life," said Ms. Robar-Orlich. "She deliberated over calling an ambulance 

at a time when every minute was urgent."</p>

<P> Because the insurance crisis has hit high-income families and millions of 

middle-class Americans with jobs, advocates for the uninsured have expressed hope 

that Washington will finally resolve the problem. High-wage workers and small-business 

owners are a much more effective lobbying force than the unemployed, children 

and the poor.</p>

<P> Mary R. Grealy, president of the Healthcare Leadership Council, an industry 

coalition seeking coverage for the uninsured, said: "We are very optimistic. More 

and more people say that the uninsured will be a big issue in the next Congress."</p>

<P> "Lawmakers have seen the new face of the uninsured — it's not a welfare population 

— and will seek solutions for the employed uninsured," the many working families 

who lack insurance, Ms. Grealy said. "This is now an issue for Republicans," she 

added. "It's not just a one-party issue."</p>

<P> Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group, said 

that Republicans and Democrats could agree on proposals combining tax credits 

with some expansion of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p>

<P> On the other hand, proposals to aid the uninsured could easily touch off a 

partisan brawl, in which lawmakers fight over the merits of government programs 

versus the private market.</p>

<P> President Bush has already proposed tax credits and is expected to offer more 

proposals to help the uninsured as part of his budget early next year.</p>

<P> In his first two budgets, Mr. Bush earmarked a large amount of money for health 

insurance tax credits: $89 billion over 10 years, for people who are not covered 

by an employer's plan and not eligible for public programs. The proposal languished 

in Congress, but Mr. Bush will have a greater incentive to push for action this 

year.</p>

<P> "The president wants to develop a record on health care to neutralize this 

issue going into the 2004 elections," Mr. Pollack said.</p>

<P> The issue is of particular concern to small-business owners, who say they 

would like to offer their employees health insurance but cannot keep up with the 

fast-rising premiums. They are a large and influential lobby and an important 

base for the Republican Party.</p>

<P> Martyn Hopper, the California state director for the National Federation of 

Independent Business, said that 42 percent of the state organization's 37,000 

member businesses did not offer their employees health care coverage. He blames 

rising premiums and the high cost of doing business in California, which has imposed 

a number of expensive mandates on employers. Big companies, Mr. Hopper said, can 

move operations to cheaper locations or offshore, but mom-and-pop businesses are 

forced to lay off workers or make their employees pay an ever-increasing share 

of health care costs.</p>

<P> Tom Lucas, who owns two plant nurseries outside Los Angeles, said that he 

provided health coverage to his 70 employees until the mid-1990's, when the cost 

became crushing. Mr. Lucas said that some of his workers have spouses with jobs 

that provided insurance, some drove to Mexico to seek cheap treatment and drugs, 

and some did without.</p>

<P> He said that health coverage was particularly expensive in California because 

the legislature had imposed a number of mandates on the policies that employers 

must offer, including coverage for mental illness, comprehensive cancer screening, 

substance abuse treatment and weight loss programs.</p>

<P> "Health insurance is a luxury I can't afford for my people," he said. "It's 

a great perk, but in an industry like my own, it's not reality. There's not enough 

dollars to go around."</p>

<P> <strong> Roadblocks to a Solution</strong></p>

<P> While there is continuing public concern about health care and gathering sentiment 

in Washington to do something about it, a number of constraints are limiting the 

likelihood that the growth in the numbers of the uninsured will be reversed any 

time soon.</p>

<P> Growing federal and state budget deficits will make it difficult to find money 

to subsidize coverage for the uninsured. The president and members of both parties 

have promised prescription drug benefits to the elderly, who vote in large numbers, 

and fulfilling that commitment is a higher political priority for most lawmakers 

than addressing the problem of the uninsured.</p>

<P> In addition, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers 

are demanding higher Medicare payments, which will eat up money that could be 

used to cover people with no insurance. Medical providers are much more effective 

lobbyists than are the uninsured.</p>

<P> A number of proposals on Capitol Hill would at least incrementally address 

the problem. One, sponsored by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and 

Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, would provide tax credits for the health 

insurance expenses of individuals, families and small businesses; allow small 

businesses to take a tax deduction for the full cost of their premiums; and allow 

states to cover low-income parents and legal immigrants under Medicaid and the 

Children's Health Insurance Program, know as CHIP. The bill would also provide 

federal money to the states to establish insurance purchasing cooperatives for 

small businesses and high-risk pools for people who cannot get insurance in the 

private market because of chronic illnesses.</p>

<P> As Congress debates, however, employers and workers continue to struggle with 

higher costs and more difficult access to health care.</p>

<P> Mitch Flinchum, the controller at a highway paving company in Burlington, 

N.C., sees the problems from both ends — as an executive in charge of benefits 

and as a consumer.</p>

<P> Mr. Flinchum pays more than 10 percent of his $65,000 annual salary for health 

insurance for his family, but he considers himself better off than most of his 

company's 350 workers. Only 119 of the employees accept the coverage, and two-thirds 

of those pay only for themselves and not their dependents. Mr. Flinchum says most 

of the workers who decline insurance do so because the premiums are costly and 

the coverage is so meager.</p>

<P> "When you look at your benefits, you've got massive deductibles, massive co-pays, 

and unless you have a heart attack or cancer, which would be devastating in itself, 

it's like you don't have any insurance," he said.</p>

<P> "I don't know where it stops," Mr. Flinchum added. "With a 20 percent increase 

each year, over time the only two people in this country who will be able to have 

health insurance are Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. No one else can afford it."</p>
