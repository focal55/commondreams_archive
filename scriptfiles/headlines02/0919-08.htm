<p>COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Even on a day when a late-summer rain coats the woods, 

it is clear that Idaho Panhandle National Forest is sick.</p>

<p>Beetles have sucked life from thousands of acres. Floods have torn out mountainsides 

and stirred up old mining pollution. A century of fire suppression and logging 

have radically altered the forest fabric.</p>

<p>To save this forest, one of the nation's biggest at 2.5 million acres, federal 

officials have concluded that they have to burn or log sections of it, tear out 

some roads and then hope that nature takes over the healing.</p>

<p>The Bush administration and Western Republicans like that idea, especially 

the logging part. But the administration is pushing to go further: to suspend 

environmental laws and citizen appeals so logging in dangerously fire-prone forests 

like this one can be done without disruption. The White House has asked Congress 

to exempt about 10 million acres of federal forestland from environmental reviews 

to speed treatment of overgrown forests.</p>

<p>But as the Bush plan moves through the Senate this week in the form of a rider 

promoted by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, the resistance among environmentalists 

and some Western politicians has grown fierce. A tentative peace that fell over 

public forests this summer, during one of the biggest most disastrous wildfire 

years in history, has been replaced by a political battle that threatens forest 

management.</p>

<p>Environmentalists say President Bush is using fire treatment as a way to let 

the timber industry log without laws.</p>

<p>Gov. John Kitzhaber, D-Ore., accuses the administration of betraying an agreement 

among Western governors to treat fire-prone forests without suspending the law 

or taking away judicial appeals. Bush signed on to the governors' 10-year plan 

last May, but then took it a step further in an initiative unveiled three weeks 

ago.</p>

<p>Opposition to the Bush plan promises to be particularly intense here in the 

Idaho Panhandle, which has at least one legendary trout stream and a tradition 

rich in silver mining and logging. Several retail-level environmental groups have 

persistently thwarted plans here to treat forests by cutting down trees.</p>

<p>All 16 proposals to log or thin the Panhandle's woods in the last two years 

were stalled by appeals from these groups, forest officials said. Still, the plans 

are moving ahead, usually in a modified form to answer the concerns of critics.</p>

<p>One logging plan would cut 1,400 acres in an area that holds water for thousands 

of people in Idaho and Eastern Washington. It has been appealed by the Lands Council, 

based in Spokane. The group also appealed another plan, which called for quick 

removal of beetle-infested trees.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of dead and dying trees out there that need treatment," said 

Dave O'Brien, spokesman for the managers of the Panhandle National Forest. "But 

the law gets very difficult to comply with. We end up spending so much time just 

trying to make these forest decisions bulletproof."</p>

<p>The biggest hindrance to healthy forests, Bush officials say, are laws that 

force managers of public land to spend too much time responding to objections 

from citizens.</p>

<p>But what the Bush administration characterizes as "gridlock" and "analysis 

paralysis" is seen by others as the messy but necessary products of making land 

decisions in a democracy. The president's plan, they say, would take the public 

out of public forest management.</p>

<p>"This plan is about as extreme, wrongheaded and overreaching as it could possibly 

be," said Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society.</p>

<p>The wilderness group is not opposed to thinning forests for fire prevention 

near urban areas, but does object to large-scale logging in the name of forest 

health.</p>

<p>Even if the Senate approves part of the Bush plan this week, and environmental 

laws are suspended for the one year called for in the Senate amendment, the Forest 

Service has an enormous task in trying to reduce fire risk in the West. About 

70 million acres of Forest Service land are dry, overgrown and ready to burn after 

a century of fire suppression. The Forest Service no longer talks of preventing 

fires in these areas, but letting fire do the work it once did in the natural 

world.</p>

<p>"It is absolutely critical that we get fire back into those woods," said Dale 

Bosworth, the chief of the Forest Service, in an interview.</p>
