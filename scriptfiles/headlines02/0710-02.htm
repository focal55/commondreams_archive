generations can expect to see a severe fall in living standards as humanity begins 

to pay for its huge environmental "overdraft" with planet Earth, a leading conservation 

group has claimed.</p> 

<p>Human development will begin to plummet within 30 years because we are fast 

running out of space and resources to sustain the turbo-charged lifestyle of the 

developed world, says <a href="http://www.panda.org/" target="_new">WWF International</a>.</p>

<p>Unless governments take urgent action to encourage a more sustainable way of 

life, human welfare will go into drastic decline by 2030 with falls in average 

life expectancies, lower educational levels and a shrinking economy, the WWF's 

<i>Living Planet Report 2002 </i>says. Exploitation of the Earth's renewable resources 

has grown by 80 per cent in the past 40 years and is now 20 per cent higher than 

the natural capacity of the planet to replenish itself, the report, published 

yesterday, says.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s the use of natural resources has consistently outstripped supply 

and yet the rate at which resources are being depleted is increasing because more 

people are chasing a higher standard of living at the expense of environmental 

degradation.</p>

<p>Within 50 years we will be exploiting the renewable resources equivalent to 

two planet Earths &#150; which is clearly impossible to maintain.</p>

<p>Jonathan Loh, the author of the report, said the current rate at which the 

human population was growing and using natural resources was fundamentally unsustainable 

and, without further change, a point would come when development would go into 

reverse.</p>

<p>"We do not know exactly what the result will be of running this massive overdraft 

with the Earth. What is clear, though, is that it would be better to control our 

own destiny, rather than leave it up to chance," Mr Loh said.</p>

<p>According to the report, the Earth has about 11.4 billion hectares of productive 

space on land and sea, which means about 1.9 hectares for each of the 6 billion 

people on the planet. Yet the average consumption per head of population is equivalent 

to about 2.3 hectares per person.</p>

<p>This "ecological footprint" varies enormously when differences in lifestyle 

are taken into account. The typical African, for instance, consumes resources 

equivalent to 1.4 hectares of land, whereas for the average European it is 5 hectares, 

rising to 9.6 hectares for the typical American.</p>

<p>Claude Martin, the director general of WWF International, says in the report's 

foreword that improvements in the quality of life for many people in the world 

since the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 have exacted an "unacceptable price" from the 

global ecosystem.</p>

<p>"The past decade has witnessed fires on an unprecedented scale in the tropical 

forests of Brazil and Indonesia, coral bleaching that has left vast areas of reef 

in the Caribbean, Indian and Pacific oceans as ghosts of their former selves, 

the collapse of commercially viable fish stocks in the Atlantic, the ecological 

devastation of the Black Sea, Aral Sea and Lake Chad, and the continual loss of 

precious wetland and freshwater ecosystems around the world," Mr Martin said. 

"By continuing to abuse the biosphere, and through the inequitable sharing of 

the Earth's resources, we undermine the chances of eradicating poverty, and put 

the whole of humanity under the threat of global climate change."</p>

<p>A spokesman for the WWF said that where once each generation could expect to 

be financially better off and have a higher standard of living than their parents 

and grandparents, scientists were now predicting a reversal of fortunes.</p>

<p>The report was published 50 days before the start of the World Summit on Sustainable 

Development, which begins in Johannesburg on 26 August.</p> </p>
