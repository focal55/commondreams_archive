<p>HELSINKI   - The U.N.'s human rights chief said  Tuesday that the U.S.-led "war on terror" was hurting human  rights and exacerbating prejudices around the world.

<p>



		"The war on terrorism has had some damaging effects, I  would suggest, on human rights standards across the world,"  United Nations High Commissioner for Human rights Sergio Vieira  de Mello told a news conference in Helsinki.<p>

</table></font>Governments across the globe have invoked the "war on  terror," announced by President Bush after Sept. 11, 2001,  attacks in the United States, to justify activities that de  Mello said are damaging human rights in the industrialized and  developing worlds.<p>



		De Mello said he understood the need to provide security  against attacks on civilians after the September 11 attacks  which killed more than 3,000 people. But he said that the "war  on terror" had aggravated existing prejudices.<p>



		On Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers seized four airliners, smashed  two into the World Trade Center in New York and another into  the Pentagon near Washington. The fourth crashed in a rural  Pennsylvania field.<p>



		The U.N. human rights chief echoed the worries expressed by  his predecessor Mary Robinson last month about the rise in  discrimination against Muslims.<p>



		"Arabs and Muslims at large are experiencing increasing  incidents of racial discrimination ... Singling out, finger  pointing and ... even in some instances (violence)," he said.<p>



		The United States blamed the September 11 attacks on Saudi  born Islamic militant Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network.  Several of the suspected hijackers were Saudis.<p>



		De Mello also said anti-Semitism was an issue that needed  to be met head on.<p>



		He declined to predict if he believed there would be a war  on Iraq, but said that the United Nations had learned its  lesson from past conflicts and would be ready to act if a  humanitarian crisis developed.<p>



		"We must at any cost prevent civilians from becoming what  some irresponsible people call 'collateral damage'," he said.  "In Iraq...civilians have suffered enough."<p>



		De Mello, speaking earlier at conference on racism and  xenophobia, also said he would unveil a plan in 2003 for  improving relations between the Muslim and non-Muslim world,  warning that differences would lead to disaster. "I intend to  take an initiative in 2003 to improve understanding between the  Muslim world and ourselves and open a new era," de Mello said.  "If we continue on this (current) path, we will end up in  disaster."<p>



		He did not comment further on the initiative, saying he was  still consulting with governments.<p>
