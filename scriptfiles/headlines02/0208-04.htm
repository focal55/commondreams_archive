GENEVA   - 

The International Committee of the Red

Cross said on Friday it considered Taliban and al Qaeda

fighters held by U.S. forces to be prisoners of war, despite

Washington's refusal to accept that.

<p>"They were captured in combat (and) we consider them

prisoners of war," ICRC spokesman Darcy Christen told Reuters.

<p>

President Bush agreed on Thursday to apply the Geneva

Conventions to Taliban prisoners but said the al Qaeda network

could not be considered a state that is party to the treaty,

which guarantees a wide range of rights to captives.

<p>

Even though acknowledging the Conventions applied to the

Taliban, Washington said that group would not be granted full

prisoner of war status.

<p>

A spokesman for United Nations High Commissioner for Human

Rights Mary Robinson, who has warned the United States it must

treat captives humanely, said she felt Washington's decision

could be a "step forward."

<p>

But Jose Luis Diaz added that her legal advisers were still

examining the implications of Bush's announcement.

<p>

Britain, the staunchest ally of the United States in its

war against those it considers responsible for the September 11

attacks in New York and Washington, welcomed the move.

<p>

There was no immediate response from other European

countries, several of which have expressed strong reservations

about the way captives from the war in Afghanistan are held.

<p>

Washington triggered a storm of international protest after

a photograph was released showing some inmates at the

Guantanamo Bay prison camp manacled, blindfolded and on their

knees. The United States has dismissed all suggestions of

mistreatment.

<p>

STATUS STILL DISPUTED

<p>

Granting prisoner of war status to the captives would have

given them sweeping rights, including the right to disclose

only their name, rank and serial number under interrogation and

to go home as soon as the conflict ended.

<p>

Both the ICRC and Robinson said that under the Geneva

Conventions, to which the United States is a signatory, any

dispute over the status of a prisoner must be settled by a

tribunal and not the government of one of the sides to the

conflict.

<p>

"You cannot simply decide...what applies to one person and

what applies to another. This has to go to court because it is

a legal decision not a political one," Christen said.

<p>

The ICRC spokesman also noted that Article Three of the

Third Geneva Convention on captives taken in international

combat applied to all fighters.

<p>

The article sets out minimum standards, including

prohibiting cruel treatment and guaranteeing that any trial of

prisoners must be carried out before a "regularly constituted"

court.

<p>

Christen said that there was no category under humanitarian

law giving more than minimum Article Three protection but

falling short of full prisoner of war status -- as the U.S.

decision implied. "It does not exist," he said.

<p>

U.S. officials have expressed concern that if Washington

gave prisoner of war status to Taliban fighters and members of

al Qaeda -- the network loyal to Saudi-born militant Osama bin

Laden who Washington says masterminded the September 11 attacks

-- it would be virtually impossible to interrogate them.

<p>

Christen noted that former Panamanian dictator Manuel

Noriega -- overthrown and captured by U.S. troops in 1990 --

was formally declared a prisoner of war but this did not

prevent him being tried and jailed in the United States for

drugs offences.

<p>

The ICRC is visiting prisoners held at the U.S. naval base

at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as well as inside Afghanistan and will

continue to report on their treatment based on standards laid

down in the Geneva Convention.</p>
