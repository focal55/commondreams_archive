<p>As George Bush was displaying his grasp of  diplomatic vocabulary in front of the UN yesterday,  7,000 miles away in the Gulf his fellow Americans were  speaking a different language. 

<P>Their words were military terms: frigates, bombers, air defense fighters, refueling 

tankers, carrier battle groups, reconnaissance planes, special forces. All these 

things are on their way to the region or already in position in readiness for 

a possible attack on Iraq.

<P>In the most blunt indication yet that the US  administration's threat is not an idle one and it will  force Iraq if necessary to meet its UN pledges, the US  central command will move its headquarters to Qatar in  November, perhaps indefinitely. The relocation is the  culmination of a series of low-key moves on the Gulf  chessboard designed to put all the pieces in place for  a rapid US assault should the UN route now being  pursued by Washington fail.

<P>The establishment of command posts and the pre-positioning of heavy equipment 

in the region over the past year have put central command (CENTCOM) in a position 

to launch a strike on Baghdad within a fortnight of the order being given, if 

it is decided to mount the operation with a fast and light force of 50,000. There 

are about 30,000 American troops in the region already.

<P>"It would take 10 days to bring in the additional  equipment, 10 days to airlift the troops and 10 days to  get to Baghdad," said John Pike, the head of  GlobalSecurity.org, a thinktank which closely monitors  military movements.

<P>Nor would it take long to complete the military build-up if it were decided 

to play it safe and gather an overwhelming force of 200,000 or more before striking. 

Under CENTCOM's blueprint for a full-scale invasion, Operation Plan 1003, the 

force could be assembled in two months. That would be much faster than the six 

months' build-up in the last Gulf war, partly because it would involve fewer troops, 

partly because the sluggish US military machine has become gradually more nimble.

<P>The deployment of CENTCOM's headquarters from Florida to Qatar is officially 

part of a biennial exercise called Internal Look and is supposed to last a week. 

However it is highly unusual for General Tommy Franks, the man who would command 

an Iraqi invasion, and 600 of his top staff, to take part in such a distant relocation. 

The Pentagon has also made it clear that the move could be permanent.

<P>In the past few months, the $1.7bn al-Udeid base in Qatar has been expanded 

and enhanced to serve as an alternative to Saudi Arabia, which acted host to US 

headquarters in the first Gulf war, but which has refused to get involved this 

time. Some Pentagon officials still believe that the Saudis will relent at the 

last moment, and say that the Prince Sultan air base near Riyadh, where a hi-tech 

command and control center was completed last summer, is their first choice.

<P>The US air force has since the spring been moving computer equipment and munitions 

to al-Udeid, home to the region's longest runway (4,500 meters). Engineers are 

also at work replicating the base's state-of-the-art combined air operations center, 

from where complex large-scale air raids can be coordinated.

<P>Viewed on their own, each of these individual chess  moves looks quotidian. Taken together, they start to  look like a well-implemented game plan.<P>There are already 400 US warplanes in the region.<P>In another small sign of military wheels turning faster,  the Washington Kurdish Institute received a call  yesterday from the US air force seeking a "crash  course" in Kurdish. It would have to start soon, an air  force officer said, and some students might have to  leave at short notice.<P>Gen Franks's force commanders are also already in  the Gulf, having quietly established and expanded  command posts there over the past few months.

<P>The US third army, CENTCOM's ground component, set up its headquarters in Kuwait 

in November, and work has been under way since then to transform it into a hub 

for ground operations. A specialized marine unit with equipment to detect chemical 

biological or radiological attacks, is also on the way to Kuwait.

<P>The marine headquarters was ordered to Bahrain in  January this year, to set up camp alongside the US  navy's 5th fleet, which has been based there for years.<P><B>Reinforced</B><P>US special forces are also believed to have been  considerably reinforced in the Gulf. The navy seals  have set up a headquarters in Bahrain. Other units are  in Kuwait, Qatar and Oman, where the SAS is also  training.

<P>Large amounts of equipment have been warehoused in the Gulf so that it is instantly 

available when the order to invade is given. Mr Pike said there were enough tanks, 

armored cars and munitions in place in Qatar and Kuwait for three heavy mechanized 

brigades (a total of up to 15,000 troops).

<P>Less visible, but no less definite, is the British move towards military preparedness. 

The Royal Navy's flagship, the Ark Royal, is on long-planned exercises in the 

Mediterranean. It could provide a floating command and control center for British 

forces and base for Royal Marine commandos and special forces.

<P>There are two specific ways in which the RAF could help the US - refueling 

US navy aircraft and providing intelligence from high-flying Canberra planes equipped 

with aerial reconnaissance cameras. The third - passive - contribution would be 

the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. It was used by B-52 bombers 

in the 1991 Gulf war and in the recent Afghanistan campaign. Equipment loaded 

on to ships ready to sail from Diego Garcia could be in the Gulf within a week.

<P>On the ground, Britain's contribution would consist of two distinct elements 

- paratroopers from the 16 assault brigade, SAS troops, and possible marine commandos 

dropped into Iraq by helicopter, and - in the event of a full-scale land invasion 

- two heavily armored brigades equipped with Challenger 2 battle tanks.

<P>These are based in Germany and are unlikely to be ready for action in the Gulf 

before the end of the year, British defense sources say. On top of this litany 

of military preparations, the bombing, of course, is already under way. Senior 

British defense sources yesterday told the Guardian that US and UK aircraft were 

stepping up "no-fly" patrols over southern Iraq to destroy the air defense system, 

as a prelude to a possible invasion.

<P>British defense sources said yesterday that US and UK planes were patrolling 

in an "unpredictable" way. However, the past week's air strikes show that they 

are attacking targets over a wide area.

<P>The targets have included a large Iraqi military base  250 miles south-west of Baghdad and an anti-ship  missile base near the southern port of Basra. One of  the reasons why the patrols have increased is that US  radar-jamming "Prowler" aircraft have returned to the  Gulf after action in Afghanistan. British Tornado fighters  and bombers based in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia rely on  American planes to jam Iraqi radar.

<P>British defense sources have now given up the pretence that the southern no-fly 

zone is a humanitarian exercise designed to protect Iraqi Shias and Marsh Arabs. 

They too are increasingly bluntly speaking the language of war.</p>
