<p> Israel's embassy in Dublin said yesterday it is sacking a press officer who 

wrote a letter to Irish newspapers condemning the Israeli air force bombing of 

the Gaza strip this week.</p>

<p>In a letter published in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> Dr Noreen O'Carroll, 

an Irish citizen employed by the embassy, wrote that "I am sick at heart at this, 

as I am at each and every attack on Israeli citizens".</p>

<p>Fifteen Palestinians were killed and hundreds more injured when an Israeli 

F-16 fighter bomber dropped a one-ton bomb to assassinate the military chief of 

the extremist Hamas militia and his bodyguard.</p>

<p>Dr O'Carroll's letter said "a missile attack on an apartment building, after 

midnight when children and adults are asleep in their beds, is no more justifiable 

than a suicide bombing. I am appalled and ashamed of the current Israeli government 

for sanctioning this and other similar operations."</p>

<p>She added: "I am also appalled and ashamed of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's 

cold-hearted response to it, stating that it was 'one of our greatest successes'. 

Has he any heart, any moral sense at all?"</p>

<p>The letter concluded that "there is a huge divergence of opinion within both 

the political establishment and civil society in Israel about the policies of 

the current Israeli government. I want to put it on record that such divergence 

of opinion also extends to the 'local staff' of Israeli embassies."</p>

<p>In another version of the letter published in the rival <i>Irish Examiner</i> 

Dr O'Carroll quoted the Jewish-Italian writer and Holocaust survivor Primo Levi, 

who wrote that in such matters "silence is complicity".</p>

<p>The letters were signed by Dr O'Carroll in her capacity as "press officer, 

Embassy of Israel, Dublin". Yesterday, the charg&eacute; d'affaires in the Dublin 

embassy, Boaz Rodkin, said that Dr O'Carroll had been suspended and further action 

would follow after consultations with the Israeli foreign ministry &#150; "at 

the end of the day she will not be able to come back to work", he said.</p>

<p>Mr Rodkin added: "Nobody in their right mind expects an organization to keep 

a press officer who speaks against it. It's extraordinary what she did."</p>
