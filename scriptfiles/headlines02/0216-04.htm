<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Thomas E. White left the Enron Corporation last year to become George Bush's  Secretary of the Army. He was sworn in on May 31, 2001. Soon thereafter his 'Official Biography' was put up on the US Department of the Army's <a href="http://www.army.mil">website</a>.

<p>Secretary White  was proud of his long-time leading role in the Bush family's favorite corporation. And it showed in his 'Official Biography':

<p>

<i>&quot;Prior to his appointment as Secretary of the Army, Secretary White served as Vice Chairman of Enron Energy Services, the Enron Corporation subsidiary responsible for providing energy outsource solutions to commercial and industrial customers throughout the United States. Mr. White was responsible for the delivery component of energy management services, which included commodity management; purchasing, maintaining, and operating energy assets; developing and implementing energy information services; capital management; and facilities management. &quot;

</i>

<p><i>&quot;Secretary White also served as a member of Enron's Executive Committee and was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for Enron Operations Corporation. He was also responsible for the Enron Engineering and Construction Company, which managed an extensive construction portfolio with domestic and international projects.&quot;</i>

</i></font>White had just cashed in $12.1 million in Enron stock and remained close with 'Kenny Boy' Lay and other Enron executives.

<p>Then the shit hit the fan. 

<p>And now the Secretary of the Army's 'Official Biography' has been altered - and White's Enron role - moved to the tail end  - is reduced to:

<p><i>&quot;From 1990 to 2001, Mr. White was employed by Enron Corporation and held various senior executive positions.&quot;</i>
