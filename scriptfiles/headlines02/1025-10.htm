<p>ST. PAUL — Senator Paul Wellstone, a two-term Democrat locked in one of the 

tightest campaigns in the nation, was killed this morning when his campaign plane 

crashed in freezing rain near Eveleth, Minn., a small town in the northeastern 

part of the state. </p>

<P> Mr. Wellstone's high school sweetheart and wife of 39 years, Sheila, 58; their 33-year-old daughter, Marcia Markuson; three campaign aides; and two pilots also died in the fiery crash, which obliterated their 11-seat turboprop among the pine trees. </p>

<P> Senator Wellstone, 58, a former political science professor, was an unabashed liberal who often landed on the short end of 99-1 votes. He remained a vigorous spokesman for the traditional brand of Democratic New Deal liberalism at a time when his party's mainstream was moving to the right, putting him at the center of a complicated political year.</p>

<P> Mr. Wellstone was one of just 23 senators — the only one in a close re-election fight — to vote this month against a resolution authorizing President Bush to take unilateral action against Iraq.</p>

<P> While Mr. Wellstone's death was mourned across the political spectrum, it produced an immediate partisan reaction, here and in Washington, because his race is seen as so critical to the balance of power in the Senate, where the Democrats hold a 50-to-49 edge.</p>

<P> With the election only 11 days away, Democrats realized they needed a strong, recognizable candidate to take his spot on the ballot. Many in the party were pushing former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, 74, who represented Minnesota in the Senate from 1964 to 1976, to take over if Senator Wellstone's sons agreed. </p>

<P> The plane crash was a shocking echo of the crash that killed Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, the Democratic Senate nominee, shortly before Election Day in 2000. In that race Mr. Carnahan's name remained on the ballot. He was elected posthumously, and his wife, Jean, was appointed to the seat.</p>

<P> Mr. Wellstone's Republican opponent, Norm Coleman, the former mayor of St. Paul, as well as the three candidates for governor immediately suspended campaign activities, while Gov. Jesse Ventura, an independent, ordered flags to half-staff through Election Day.</p>

<P> The cause of the crash was unknown. Officials said they lost track of the plane, which was supposed to land at 10 a.m. at the Eveleth-Virginia airport, at around 10:50. Ten minutes later they confirmed that the plane, a King Air A100 manufactured by <org idsrc="NYSE" value="RTN;RTN-">Raytheon</org>, had crashed a few miles from the runway there.</p>

<P> Mr. Wellstone and the others were flying from St. Paul to Eveleth to attend the funeral of Martin Rukavina, a longtime steelworker whose son, Tom, is in the Minnesota House of Representatives. He had decided to skip a rally and fundraiser with Mr. Mondale and Senator Edward M. Kennedy here in the Twin Cities this morning so he could be there. He was scheduled to meet Mr. Coleman tonight for a debate in Duluth.</p>

<P> "He was a man of principle and conviction, in a world that has too little of either," Mr. Wellstone's campaign manager, Jeff Blodgett, said as he stood outside campaign headquarters here, where scores of weeping supporters gathered as the news spread. "He was dedicated to helping the little guy, in a business dominated by the big guys."</p>

<P> Unlike the situation in Missouri two years ago, where Governor Carnahan's name remained on the ballot, Minnesota law demands that Mr. Wellstone's name be removed, according to State Attorney General Mike Hatch. It gives the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party until Thursday to nominate a replacement. The death gives Mr. Coleman an advantage, since absentee ballots already cast count.</p>

<P> In addition to Mr. Mondale, Democrats were discussing as possible replacements Alan Page, a state Supreme Court justice and former Minnesota Vikings player; Mr. Hatch; Ted Mondale, the son of the former vice president; and Hubert H. Humphrey III, known as Skip, a former state attorney general and also the son of a former vice president.</p>

<P> Mike Erlandson, the state Democratic chairman, refused today to discuss possible candidates or whether he would try to assemble the party's 500-member central committee or let the 40-member executive committee choose a replacement. </p>

<P> "I wouldn't even venture a thought today," Mr. Erlandson said. "We have to make sure we do everything in our power — Senator Wellstone would want us to — to make sure that on November 5th it's a Democrat that's elected to the United States Senate from Minnesota."</p>

<P> Mr. Ventura could appoint someone to fill out the remainder of Mr. Wellstone's term, though that person would be replaced by whoever wins the Nov. 5 election. </p>

<P> The Wellstone campaign decided to keep broadcasting one 30-second television spot, which the senator himself had helped write. "You always know where he stands and who he stands up for," the announcer says. "He's fearless about challenging even the most powerful interests to do what's right for people, for Minnesota, and that's pretty rare these days."</p>

<P> Then the senator appears, saying he does not represent oil companies, pharmaceutical companies or "the Enrons of this world."</p>

<P> "But you know what? They already have great representation in Washington," he says. It's the rest of the people that need it."</p>

<P> Messages of sympathy and admiration poured in from across the political spectrum. President Bush called him "a man of deep convictions" and "a plain-spoken fellow who did the best for his state and for his country," while the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose presidential campaigns Mr. Wellstone supported, described him as "the voice of conscience in the U.S. Senate and the catalyst of the coalition of hope."</p>

<P> Tom Harkin, the Democratic Senator from Iowa, could barely keep his composure as he tried to read a statement. He mumbled, "I can't do it," and an aide urged him to take a breath before he began. He spoke of "my best friend in the Senate," his voice breaking several times.</p>

<P> "Bobby Kennedy did not know Paul Wellstone," he said. "But he spoke of him in Cape Town, South Africa, when he said, `Each time a person stands up for an idea, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.' " </p>

<P> John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called Mr. Wellstone "tireless and unapologetic for championing the rights of working men and women — even when he stood alone." </p>

<P> Ralph Nader said the loss of the three Wellstones "deprives our country of courageous and steadfast fighters for a more just society and a peaceful world."</p>

<P> As national leaders mourned, grief spilled from the sidewalk outside Mr. Wellstone's headquarters here, where people on their lunch breaks flocked to place a bouquet under the trademark green campaign signs, grab a Wellstone button, light a candle or just cry. By 2 p.m., 100 people had crowded into the adjacent parking lot, where the dilapidated green school bus Wellstone had long used to travel the state when not hopping around it in small planes was adorned with American flags.</p>

<P> "This is the only place to be," said Dan Dobson, a lawyer who owns several office buildings in the area. "It's a dark moment for the state of Minnesota and it's a dark moment for our country, because I fear the forces of darkness will take over."</p>

<P> Janna Dethmers, 33, tears spilling down her cheeks, said, "He was one of my personal heroes." </p>

<P> Ms. Dethmers said she regretted that when she saw Mr. Wellstone out for a walk in her neighborhood recently, she left him alone rather than telling him herself. "He represented everything I believed in, and everything good."</p>

<P> Besides the Wellstones, those killed on the plane include Mary McEvoy, 49, a professor of early childhood education, associate director of the state Democratic Party and mother of three; Tom Lapic, who had worked in the senator's Minnesota office for 10 years; and Will McLaughlin, 22, who had spent the last six months as Mr. Wellstone's driver and logistics coordinator on the campaign trail. A local television station reported tonight that the pilots had been identified as Richard Conry and Michael Guess.</p>

<P> The Wellstones, who lived in a St. Paul town house, are survived by two sons, David, 37, and Mark, 30, and six grandchildren. Ms. Markuson leaves her husband, Todd, a 6-year-old son and three stepchildren.</p>

<P> A former wrestler who stood about 5 foot 5, Mr. Wellstone was recently found to have multiple sclerosis, which worsened a limp in his left leg. Still, he held records at the Capitol Police gym in Washington for the most pushups (91 in a minute) and pullups (28). </p>

<P> He disliked flying, especially in small planes, and often teased the pilots about frightening him with rough landings.</p>

<P> Even political opponents recalled warm encounters with the senator. Mr. Ventura said he always ran into Mr. Wellstone on Veterans Day, and Mr. Coleman said that despite the venom of the campaign, he never forgot a phone call he received from the senator when two St. Paul police officers were killed early in Mr. Coleman's tenure as mayor.</p>

<P> "Paul was a wrestler and we fought this out," Mr. Coleman said on the steps of his St. Paul home, where a neighbor's Wellstone lawn sign was draped with a black cloth. "If you ever watch prizefighting, at the end, the two fighters give a hug. This was never about personal stuff. I had the greatest respect for his passion."</p>

<P> Mr. Ventura, speaking at the Capitol hours before people gathered there for a candlelight vigil, urged Minnesotans to "be strong," adding, "And to be strong, we only need to remember Paul Wellstone's energy, Paul Wellstone's integrity, Paul Wellstone's absolute love of his country, the people he represented, his friends and most of all his family."</p>

<P> Mr. Mondale, who was a senator for eight years before becoming vice president in 1976 and is seen as the Democrats' elder statesman here, said Mr. Wellstone "was one of the most valiant public servants and leaders I've ever known.</p>

<P> "He had a very good mind, but he also had an honest mind," Mr. Mondale said. 

"He also had a good heart. He fought all of those years, right up until this morning, 

to change this country."</p> </p>
