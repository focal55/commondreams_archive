<p>NEW DELHI, June 19 — The game of nuclear brinkmanship between India and Pakistan, already six months old, is far from over. </p>

<P> India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said in an interview published this week that India would have gone to war if Pakistan had not promised to stop the infiltration of Islamic guerrillas into Kashmir, India's only majority Muslim state.</p>

<P> India itself has committed never to using nuclear weapons first, but Mr. Vajpayee said India was ready to risk a nuclear strike from Pakistan, which has professed no such doctrine, to stop what India regards as nearly two decades of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. </p>

<P> "India was prepared for nuclear war, but we were confident our neighbor would not resort to such madness," Mr. Vajpayee said.</p>

<P> Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, did not let India's claim of diplomatic victory stand. He asserted that India was deterred from attacking by Pakistan's conventional military prowess as well as the nuclear ability it demonstrated in 1998 and its missile tests last month.</p>

<P> "Our capability was being doubted and it was being said with arrogance that Pakistan's nuclear bluff had been called," Pakistan's official news wire quoted him as telling a group of scientists and engineers. "We were compelled to show then, in May 1998, that we were not bluffing and in May 2002 again we were compelled to show that we do not bluff." </p>

<P> Such overt talk of nuclear war has alarmed the United States, Britain and much of the world — and it appears that both India and Pakistan intended it to do so. </p>

<P> Six months ago, India mounted a huge military buildup after an attack on Parliament that India blamed on Pakistan-based Islamic militants who want to wrest Kashmir from Indian control.</p>

<P> Ever since, the world has witnesses a new brand of nuclear diplomacy in South Asia, one intended to use the threat of nuclear war to engage the influence of United States and other outside powers as leverage to settle the region's most neuralgic dispute.</p>

<P> It is a strategy that carries nearly unfathomable dangers, which have yet to pass.</p>

<P> Many analysts — both Indian and American — say Pakistan has thought for years that it could endlessly bleed India in Kashmir by covertly backing Islamic militants, safe in its belief that India would never strike back for fear Pakistan would use its nuclear weapons, as it had threatened to do. </p>

<P> But India now seems to have decided two can play that game.</p>

<P> "Until recently, it was Pakistan which sought to manipulate the risks of a nuclear confrontation for political objectives," C. Raja Mohan, the strategic affairs editor of The Hindu, wrote recently. "But it is New Delhi today that is subtly using the threat of nuclear war to get the international community to pressure Pakistan to end terrorism."</p>

<P> To be effective, India needed its threat of war to be taken seriously. By and large it has succeeded with the United States and Britain, but less conclusively with Pakistan. The Kashmir dispute seems as intractable as ever.</p>

<P> Just after India took several steps on June 10 to ease tensions, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage told the BBC that "the international community was frightened to death that we were on the verge of nuclear war."</p>

<P> Privately, some diplomats have wondered if India really would have followed through on the threat of war. By general consensus, it has no good military options. </p>

<P> The network of training camps, safe houses, communications centers and launching pads used by the militants is so widely dispersed in Pakistan that India could not wipe them all out without threatening Pakistan's independence — something India said it had no intention of doing.</p>

<P> An inconclusive military move against Pakistan — perhaps, for example, symbolic commando strikes on militants' camps in the portion of Kashmir that Pakistan controls — would have raised the military cost for Pakistan, but might also have inflamed Islamic extremists in Pakistan and further fueled anti-India terrorism.</p>

<P> Some South Asia experts and Western diplomats feared that, with a million troops facing each other on the border, even a modest strike could set off a chain of military moves that escalated into a nuclear exchange. </p>

<P> Despite the likely futility of Indian military action, Western diplomats said they said they had little choice but to assume the worst — that India might start a war that could go nuclear and kill millions of people.</p>

<P> General Musharraf himself said in an interview this spring that he would consider using nuclear weapons if Pakistan's survival were at stake, though he backed off such statements lately under international pressure. </p>

<P> "Was the huge ratcheting up of military pressure solely designed to scare the pants off the international community and pressure Pakistan or were the Indians really prepared to use it?" asked a senior Western diplomat based here. "As a last resort, they probably were prepared to use it, but the saner figures in the government wanted to avoid war, including Mr. Vajpayee."</p>

<P> Mr. Vajpayee's remarks — made to Dainik Jagran, one of India's largest Hindi-language newspapers and confirmed by his office — were emphatic about India's willingness to go to war. But they also betrayed deep doubts in India about whether General Musharraf would actually keep his pledges to end the infiltrations in Kashmir and strongly suggested that India will again wield the same threat of war some months down the line if the general does not. </p>

<P> Mr. Vajpayee said India as yet has no plans to demobilize hundreds of thousands of Indian soldiers along the border. "There is no hurry to withdraw the forces from the border," Mr. Vajpayee said. "There is no possibility of dialogue now between the two countries."</p>

<P> In the meantime, each side seems determined to convince the other that it is not blustering, maintaining the risk of actual war.</p>

<P> After General Musharraf boasted at the dinner for scientists and engineers that "we do not bluff," Nirupama Rao, spokeswoman for India's ministry of external affairs, was nothing less than dismissive. </p>

<P> "This is classic Musharraf," she replied tartly. "It's more loose talk and 

ersatz bravado."</p>
