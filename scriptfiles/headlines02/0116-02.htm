The Enron scandal has pushed US politics to the brink of a fundamental overhaul after more details emerged yesterday of the intricate web of relationships built up between the bankrupt energy trading corporation and the Bush administration with the help of millions of dollars of campaign cash. 

<P>Sponsors of a campaign finance bill, aimed at curbing the influence that heavy-spending companies wield in Washington, claimed yesterday that the controversy was almost certain to force a vote on the legislation in the House of Representatives where it has been stalled since last summer by Republican leaders. That bill needs just four more signatures to put it on the floor of the House, where its sponsors - the Republican Christopher Shays and the Democrat Marty Meehan - believe it commands a majority among congressmen shamed by the debacle.  

<P>The Senate has already passed a virtually identical bill, and President Bush, the biggest single beneficiary of Enron's largesse and a staunch opponent of campaign finance reform, would find it difficult to block. Enron's fall, Mr Meehan said, "makes it all the more likely the president will sign our bill".  

<P>"This has helped push the issue over the edge," said Jeff Cronin, a spokesman for Common Cause, a pro-reform pressure group. "The only way for congressmen to absolve themselves of the Enron taint is to support the bill."  

<P>The Enron scandal has illustrated how widely the taint has spread. According to figures compiled by a Washington watchdog, the Center for Responsive Politics, Enron spent a total of $5.8m (&#163;4m) on federal elections over the past 12 years, 73% of the money going to Republicans. The company's donations went to 71 out of 100 senators and 188 out of 435 House members.  

<P>Enron's deep financial roots on Capitol Hill helped insulate it from government attempts to regulate its business dealings. In 1996 and 1997, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, the Clinton administration attempted to persuade Congress to close a financing loophole, known as "trust-preferred securities", which was helping Enron conceal some of its debts while avoiding tax. Congress refused and the Internal Revenue Service had to drop a legal challenge to Enron's broad use of the dodge, which might have forestalled the company's meltdown last year.    

<P><B> Cash and politics jigsaw</B><BR>

 

<P>Enron's links reached deepest inside the Bush administration, packed with former Enron officials, major Enron shareholders and large-scale recipients of Enron campaign funding. President Bush himself received $826,000 from the Texan company in the eight years since he first ran for governor of that state. 

<P>The corporation's CEO, Kenneth Lay, was in many senses his political godfather and the president used to refer to him chummily as "Kenny Boy" until the scandal broke. Since then it has been "Mr Lay".  

<P>The question at the center of the US political stage now is what Enron got in return for its investment. No evidence has yet emerged that the Bush administration attempted to throw a lifeline to Enron as it fell into spectacular collapse. But the focus is shifting to the influence Enron wielded before the collapse. That appears to have been far-reaching and powerful.  

<P>The latest piece of the cash-and-politics jigsaw emerged yesterday in the form of a reported conversation between Mr Lay and the White House budget director   Mitch Daniels in October to discuss the president's proposed economic stimulus package. Enron stood to gain millions of dollars from tax cuts in the stimulus package that was blocked at the senate.  

<P>Another significant recipient of Enron's campaign help was the right-wing Texas Republican Senator Phil Gramm, one of the strongest advocates of deregulation on Capitol Hill. His wife Wendy, as the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, pushed hard to have a rule adopted which would exempt energy swaps (Enron's stock-in trade) from federal oversight.  

<P>After Mrs Gramm got her way on the rule-change, she promptly resigned from her regulatory role and joined Enron's board of directors. Her husband, who has   just announced his retirement from the Senate, has received $233,000 in campaign funding from Enron.  

<P>Enron executives also held a total of six meetings last year with the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and his staff, who were responsible for the drawing up of one of the administration's most important initiatives, the energy plan, which advocates expansion and deregulation of US production, including the opening up of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling. The Bush team also changed the law on derivatives trading in a manner that was directly beneficial to Enron.  

<P>"Enron's woes aren't really a scandal at all - instead, they're a magnifying glass allowing us to see clearly exactly how government and business operate today," the commentator Andrew Leonard wrote in the liberal online magazine Salon.com.  

<P>"You spend enough money on campaign contributions and lobbyists to buy influence and get the laws changed on your behalf, and then you sit back and count your stock options.  

<P>"Enron did it on a bigger scale than anybody else in recent memory, and ultimately, on a more incompetent scale than everybody else, but that doesn't make it exceptional."  

<P>Politicians from both parties are now falling over each other in the rush to return Enron donations.  

<P>The taint of the Enron disaster may just prove to be deep enough this time to bring down a long-entrenched system. The main barrier to its passing in the House is now the Republican whip, Tom DeLay, who has vowed to fight the Shays-Meehan bill tooth and nail. At last count, Mr Delay received a total of $28,900 from Enron's generous coffers.</p>
