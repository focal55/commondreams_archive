<p> WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 — Democratic congressmen who are visiting Iraq this week 

stirred up anger among some Republicans when they questioned the reasons President 

Bush has used to justify possible military action against Iraq.</p>

<P> One of the congressmen, Representative Jim McDermott of Washington State, 

said today that he thought President Bush was willing "to mislead the American 

people" about whether the war was needed and that the administration had gone 

back and forth between citing supposed links between Iraq and the terrorist network 

Al Qaeda and Iraq's supposed attempts to obtain weapons of mass destruction.</p>

</table></font>Mr. McDermott and Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan also said it 

might still be possible to work out a new inspection approach that would satisfy 

the Iraqis but fall short of what Mr. Bush wants.</p>

<P> The two Democrats' strong comments about a foreign policy matter while traveling 

abroad drew rebukes from Republicans at a time when the political furor over Iraq 

and over a bill on domestic security has sharply divided leaders of the two parties.</p>

<P> They spoke on the ABC News program "This Week" and in other broadcast interviews.</p>

<P> Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, who is the party's assistant 

leader in the Senate, said Mr. McDermott and Mr. Bonior "both sound somewhat like 

spokespersons for the Iraqi government." He said it was "counterproductive" to 

undermine Mr. Bush when he was seeking support from allies.</p>

<P> Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, was gentler. "As long as they're 

careful what they say and what they do, then I think it's fine," he said. "But 

all of us should keep in mind that foreign affairs, national security issues, 

etc., are generally handled by the executive branch, with the advice and consent 

of the Congress."</p>

<P> Speaking of the administration, Mr. McDermott said, "I believe that sometimes 

they give out misinformation." Then he added: "It would not surprise me if they 

came up with some information that is not provable, and they've shifted. First 

they said it was Al Qaeda, then they said it was weapons of mass destruction. 

Now they're going back and saying it's Al Qaeda again."</p>

<P> When pressed for evidence about whether President Bush had lied, Mr. McDermott 

said, "I think the president would mislead the American people." But he said he 

believed that inspections of Iraq's weapons programs could be worked out.</p>

<P> "I think they will come up with a regime that will not require coercive inspections," 

Mr. McDermott said, anticipating meetings on Monday between Hans Blix, the leader 

of the United Nations inspection group, and Iraqi officials.</p>

<P> "They said they would allow us to go look anywhere we wanted," he said of 

the Iraqis. "And until they don't do that, there is no need to do this coercive 

stuff where you bring in helicopters and armed people and storm buildings."</p>

<P> "Otherwise you're just trying to provoke them into war," he added.</p>

<P> Mr. Bonior, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, said: "We've got to 

move forward in a way that's fair and impartial. That means not having the United 

States or the Iraqis dictate the rules to these inspections."</p>
