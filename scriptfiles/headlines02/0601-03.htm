<p>Violence exploded afresh in disputed Kashmir, as relations between India and Pakistan soured further following claims by New Delhi that Islamabad's security agents had abducted an Indian diplomat.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf, meanwhile, were preparing to head Sunday for Kazakhstan to attend an Asian conference expected to be dominated by the India-Pakistan crisis.</p>

</font>They depart with tension between their countries close to flashpoint, with Kashmir reverberating with the sound of artillery fire and grenade blasts, and with foreigners in both countries hastily packing their bags for home.

<p>Police in Srinagar, India-Kashmir's summer camp, said Saturday two people were killed and 39 wounded in three separate grenade attacks they blamed on Islamic militants infiltrating from Pakistan-administered Kashmir.</p>

<p>The attacks were mainly aimed at police but the victims were instead mostly civilians, police said.</p>

<p>Incursions have been a flashpoint issue in the current South Asian crisis, with an attack on an Indian army camp in which 35 people were killed on May 14 triggering the latest sharp deterioration of relations.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Friday, however, it appeared a crackdown on the militants, demanded by India and first promised by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in January, was underway in the Himalayan region.</p>

<p>The Indian army as well as hawkish Home Affairs Minister Lal Krishna Advani, however, have dismissed the claims, saying Pakistan cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>With tensions already running high, India unleashed a tirade against Pakistan Saturday following what it claimed was the abduction of a staffer of the Indian High Commission (embassy) in Islamabad by Pakistani security agents.</p>

<p>India's foreign ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said employee Kulwant Singh was abducted from near his residence in the Pakistani capital when he was returning home with his young son.</p>

<p>"He (Singh) was returning home on his scooter with his son when an unknown number of people abducted him," Rao said.</p>

<p>"His son who was on the scooter witnessed the abduction and ran home to tell his mother."</p>

<p>Rao said the Indian acting high commissioner Sudhir Vyas had taken up the matter with Musharraf's military regime.</p>

<p>"We have conveyed our very strong protest over this unfortunate and completely regrettable incident which we condemn totally."</p>

<p>She added that the kidnapping was part of the "pathological hostility" nurtured by Pakistan against its estranged neighbor.</p>

<p>The Almaty summit comes amid a concerted diplomatic push by world leaders to try to draw the two rivals back from the brink of war.</p>

<p>Russian leader Vladmir Putin is expected to meet both Musharraf and Vajpayee separately with the aim of brokering a face-to-face session between the two leaders.</p>

<p>In a nod to the mounting concerns of the international community, Vajpayee has extended his stay in Almaty by one day to Wednesday to hold bilaterals with Russian and Chinese leaders about the crisis, officials in New Delhi said Saturday.</p>

<p>China, a close ally of Pakistan, has also offered to play a role.</p>

<p>Heavy shelling between Indian and Pakistani troops in divided Kashmir continued unabated for the 16th straight day Saturday, prompting authorities in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to order a strict black-out overnight.</p>
