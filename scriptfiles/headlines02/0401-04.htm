</font>BEIT JALA, West Bank (Reuters) - 

Seven foreign peace

activists and a Palestinian television cameraman were wounded

Monday when an Israeli soldier fired at the ground in front of

them, officials and witnesses said.

<p>

About 100 demonstrators, Palestinian and foreign, were

marching through the center of the West Bank town of Beit Jala

behind a sign saying "We want peace not war," witnesses said.

<p>

As they approached an Israeli armored personnel carrier, a

soldier in the carrier fired several shots from a rifle into

the street in front of them, sending up chips of concrete,

television footage showed.

<p>

Health officials said a Palestinian and seven foreigners

were hurt. They included two Americans, two Britons, and one

each from Australia, Japan and France.

<p>

The Palestinian, who was wounded in the leg, was a

cameraman covering the march for the Associated Press,

colleagues said.

</font></font>An Israeli soldier also kicked and pushed a Reuters

cameraman and fired one shot over his head while covering the

demonstration. He was unhurt.

<p>

Reuters lodged a complaint with the army over the incident.

<p>

The director of Beit Jala hospital, Peter Qumri, said one

woman was undergoing surgery to remove shrapnel from her

abdomen and was in a satisfactory condition.

<p>

A witness from Beit Jala, who gave his name only as Fouad,

said: "We were just marching in front of the tank and far away

from our position they began to shoot live ammunition on the

international (demonstrators).

<p>

"The marchers raised their hands in a peaceful way and they

started shooting immediately," he said. "Six or seven people

were brought to the hospital."

<p>

The Israeli army said it was checking the report.

<p>

Groups of foreign peace activists are in the West Bank to

show solidarity with Palestinians after Israeli forces sent

troops and tanks Friday to besiege Palestinian President Yasser

Arafat's headquarters in the city of Ramallah.

<p>

The army said earlier Monday that troops had stopped 50

foreigners, mostly Italians, from entering Ramallah, where they

had planned to join others who reached Arafat's office Sunday.

<p>

The group, calling itself Grassroots International

Protection for the Palestinian People, wants to shield Arafat

from Israeli troops who have taken over most of his compound.

<p>

Israeli police said the army had handed over 10 French

nationals to their custody pending their expulsion from

Israel.
