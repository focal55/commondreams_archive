<p>RUSSIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin warned George W. Bush yesterday 

against unilateral action in Iraq, and suggested the U.S. President needs to keep 

a close eye on his allies, as well as his perceived foes, in the war on terrorism.</P>

<P>After an 80-minute meeting amid the imperial splendor of the Catherine Palace 

in the countryside south of St. Petersburg, Mr. Putin repeated his long-held belief 

that any action against Iraq should be taken within the framework of the United 

Nations. He also suggested Iraq shouldn't be the top priority, and that the focus 

on Saddam Hussein is a distraction from the international antiterrorism fight.</P>

<P>Asked by a U.S. reporter about his position on military action in Iraq, Mr. 

Putin turned the focus to neighboring Saudi Arabia, a country seen by the White 

House as a front-line, if not entirely reliable, ally since last year's attacks 

on New York and Washington.</P>

<P>&#34;We should not forget about those who finance terrorism,&#34; Mr. Putin 

said. &#34;Of the 19 terrorists who committed the main attacks on Sept. 11 against 

the United States, 16 are citizens of Saudi Arabia, and we should not forget about 

that.&#34;</P>

<P>Mr. Putin also cautioned that while Pakistan, another ostensible U.S. ally, 

has been reasonably stable under the rule of President Pervez Musharraf, the country 

has a dangerous mix of both nuclear weapons and active militant groups that needs 

to be watched.</P>

<P>As if underscoring his point that the war on terrorism can't be constrained 

to Iraq, Mr. Putin then asked a question that has been on the minds of many of 

late: &#34;Where has Osama bin Laden taken refuge?&#34;</P>

<P>In the process, he gently poked at what has become a U.S. sore spot since audiotapes 

released earlier this month seemed to confirm the al-Qaeda leader is still alive.</P>

<P>Since the tapes surfaced, politicians in the United States and around the world 

have questioned whether Mr. Bush should not focus first on finishing the fight 

against al-Qaeda before tackling the Iraq question.</P>

<P>However, despite Russia's reservations about using military action to disarm 

Mr. Hussein, Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush did sign on to a joint declaration calling 

for Iraq to disarm.</P>

<P>&#34;We call on Iraq to co-operate fully and unconditionally in its disarmament 

obligations or face serious consequences,&#34; the statement reads. However, it 

made no reference to the possible use of military action to enforce the demand.</P>

<P>While Russia, one of Iraq's few diplomatic allies, maintains that the recently 

passed UN resolution that sent weapons inspectors back to Baghdad does not contain 

any automatic triggers for war, the language of the statement was tough enough 

to send oil prices higher in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</P>

<P>Mr. Bush made the trip to Russia yesterday to communicate to a skeptical public 

here that this week's decision to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 

into former Soviet territory is nothing to be feared. The alliance's enemy, Mr. 

Bush said, is no longer Moscow, but international terrorist organizations such 

as al-Qaeda.</P>

<P>&#34;The strategy of NATO is going to be based upon the fact that the Cold 

War is over,&#34; Mr. Bush said. &#34;Russia is a friend; Russia is not an enemy.&#34;</P>

<P>After his meeting with Mr. Putin, the U.S. President flew onward to Vilnius 

to meet with the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, three of the newest 

NATO members.</P>

<P>The Baltic republics -- once part of the Soviet Union, and now elated to be 

embraced by the West -- were preparing a hero's welcome for Mr. Bush.</p>
