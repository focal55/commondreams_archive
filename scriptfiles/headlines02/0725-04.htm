<p>Israel's air strike on Gaza on Tuesday, which killed nine Palestinian children, 

may have wrecked an imminent commitment by Palestinian militants to end suicide 

bombings against Israeli civilians.</p>

</table></font>Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief, said yesterday that an agreement 

had been within reach. British officials were part of a EU and US team that was 

finalizing the terms of an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire when Israel launched 

its missile attack, diplomatic sources confirmed.</p>

<p>They stopped short of pronouncing the agreement dead, saying that talks could 

continue. But they indicated that the attack, in which the commander of the military 

wing of the militant Hamas organization and 14 civilians were killed, had scuppered 

the Palestinian-proposed deal for now.</p>

<p>Israel's Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, is facing his heaviest criticism for 

months for authorizing the attack. Quoting a presidential aide, <i>The New York 

Times</i> said George Bush was "visibly angry" when he heard of the strike.</p>

<p>Questions are being asked over the timing of the bombing. Diplomatic sources 

would not be drawn on whether they believed the attack was timed deliberately 

to thwart the proposed agreement. Israeli officials said the strike was an opportunistic 

attack based on the whereabouts of its target, Sheikh Salah Shahadah, who died 

in the bombing.</p>

<p>The Israeli newspaper <i>Yedioth Ahronoth</i> reported that only 90 minutes 

before the bombing, leading Palestinians linked to Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement 

had agreed to publish a call for a unilateral end to attacks on civilians in Israel.</p>

<p><i>Yedioth Ahronoth</i> printed what it said was a declaration that was meant 

to be published today. "From this moment on," it reads, "we will cease all attacks 

on innocent men, women and children who are non- combatants. We call on all the 

political organizations and Palestinian movements to cease these attacks immediately, 

without hesitation or conditions."</p>

<p>Leading figures inside Fatah and its Tanzim militia were understood to have 

agreed to the declaration. Fatah is believed to be linked to the militant Al-Aqsa 

Martyrs Brigades, which has claimed several suicide bombings and other attacks.</p>

<p>The militant Islamist Hamas also agreed to honor the call, reports said. Hours 

before the air strike, the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, said 

the group would consider ending suicide attacks if the Israeli army withdrew from 

West Bank towns it has reoccupied.</p>

<p>After Sheikh Shahadah's death, Hamas said all prospects of an end to attacks 

were off.</p>

<p>The criticism of Mr Sharon increased when it emerged that the Israeli air force 

had used a one-ton bomb. Previous assassination attempts have used guided missiles, 

which are more accurate and cause less destruction.</p>

<p>It was clear that the Israeli government was unprepared for the deluge of condemnation 

that it received from around the world. On Tuesday morning, Mr Sharon unapologetically 

described the raid as "one of our biggest successes". By the evening, however, 

the government was expressing its regrets in an attempt to limit the damage.</p>

<p>Mr Sharon told <i>Yedioth Ahronoth </i>that if he had known the attack would 

cause such heavy civilian casualties, he would not have authorized it.</p>

<p>But the bomb was targeted at a packed residential area. On the ground it was 

clear that any strike on that site would cause heavy civilian casualties, let 

alone a one-ton bomb.</p>

<p>The foreign minister, Shimon Peres, promised a full investigation, telling 

the BBC: "What happened is really regrettable. It wasn't done intentionally. I 

think all of us feel sorry for the loss of life of innocent people, particularly 

children."</p>

<p>As Arab anger intensified, the United Nations Security Council scheduled an 

open debate on the attack.</p>

<p>An editorial in <i>Ma'ariv</i> newspaper said yesterday: "Considering the location 

of the house and the time of the operation, it should have been clear to the decision-makers 

that children would be among the casualties.</p>

<p>"Ariel Sharon was, in fact, the only politician who was familiar with the details 

of the operation and authorized it. He is, therefore, responsible and even if 

he says over and over that it was a great success, he is wrong and misleading."</p>
