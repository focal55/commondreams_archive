between the White House and black American leaders slumped to a new low yesterday 

after President Bush gave a dismissive answer when asked why he was not addressing 

the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples, 

the most respected black pressure group in the US. 

<P>At his press conference on Monday night, Mr Bush answered: "Let's see. There I was sitting around the table with foreign leaders looking at Colin Powell and Condi Rice _ " His voice then trailed away, he shook his head and moved on to the next question; the implication being that two black people in his inner circle was a substitute for outreach to the rest of the community.  <P>His words were certain to cause outrage, and seemed an uncharacteristic piece of political ineptitude.  <P>"You can't be president of all the people when you only want to be president for some of the people," said the NAACP chief executive, Kweisi Mfume.  <P>Julian Bond, the NAACP chairman, said of Mr Bush: "We knew he was in the oil business - we just didn't know it was snake oil."  <P>Mr Bond said that groups opposed to civil rights now held "unprecedented power" in the Bush administration.  <P>A justice department spokeswoman, Barbara Comstock, said the speeches ignored the administration's actual record.  <P>The Houston Chronicle suggested that the snub had been deliberate: "In search of a more receptive audience, Bush is taking his message of home ownership, welfare reform and faith-based initiatives directly to the African-American churches, service providers and others who may be more likely to embrace it."  <P>The Chronicle reported that in a recent internal White House memo on political strategy African-Americans were the only group listed under "areas for improvement".  <P>At the 2000 election, Mr Bush won just 9% of black votes, and there is bitterness that without the effective disenfranchisement of many black voters in Florida, Al Gore would be president. </p>
