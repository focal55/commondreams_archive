</table>Libertarian candidate Jeff Zastrow of Eau Claire beat the American humorist and writer as the third-largest vote-getter in La Crosse County in the congressional race with 1,156 votes. Kind easily won re-election to his fourth term.</P><P>The La Crosse Coalition for Peace and Justice initiated a write-in campaign for Twain to protest Kind's position on the Iraq war resolution. Kind, a La Crosse Democrat, was the lone Democrat from Wisconsin to vote for the House resolution giving President Bush authority to use force against Iraq.</P><P>In a review of the write-in votes in La Crosse County, the Tribune and the La Crosse County Clerk's office could not come up with an official vote total because of problems with a few write-in records. But the total was between 501 and 507 votes for Twain. The La Crosse Coalition for Peace and Justice calculated 506 votes.</P><P>Samuel Clemens, Twain's real name, received one write-in vote for Congress and one vote for governor. Twain received write-in votes for governor, attorney general and every La Crosse County office including district attorney and sheriff.</P><P>Guy Wolf, a member of the La Crosse Coalition for Peace and Justice, said Twain received votes for Congress in other counties, and he expects the total number in the 3rd District to top 600.</P><P>"I was surprised at how many voted for Mark Twain," Wolf said. "Our goal was 500 for the whole district because it's difficult to write-in a name with all the different kinds of ballots in the district."</P><P>"Voting is a private, moral matter, and Mark Twain was a throw-away vote, and many couldn't do it," he said. "We're happy with those who did. We did this with spending no money and starting the campaign only two weeks before the election."</P><P>Wolf said many respected citizens who are active in the community cast the Mark Twain vote.</P><P>He said the coalition's campaign received national publicity and raised awareness about a potential war in Iraq.</P><P>"We need to continue to ask Ron Kind to hold the administration accountable for a war in Iraq, and we need to keep the discussions going," Wolf said.</P><P>"Ron Kind's position on the Iraq war resolution - and not Ron Kind - attracted the Mark Twain vote," he said.</P><P>Twain was selected as a write-in candidate because of his anti-war stance and name recognition. "Twain focused on the consequences of war," Wolf said.</P>

<P>He said the La Crosse Coalition for Peace and Justice is planning other anti-war 

events and peace rallies in the future. "We want to keep the momentum going," 

Wolf said.</p> </P>
