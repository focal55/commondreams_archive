<p>Thousands of Minnesotans, stunned by the death of U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone but galvanized to carry forward his work, rallied Saturday at the Cathedral of St. Paul and marched to the state Capitol to protest a war in Iraq.</p>

<p>The anti-war gathering, which drew people of all ages and members of more than 50 peace organizations, was the largest in recent years. It was held simultaneously with demonstrations in New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and other cities.</p>

</table></font>Protest organizers, a coalition of groups forming Minnesotans Against War on Iraq, expected more than 2,000 participants for the demonstration in St. Paul. During speeches at the Capitol, they claimed 10,500 attended. State troopers posted along the protest route and at the Capitol estimated the crowd at between 3,000 and 4,000.</p>

<p>"I haven't personally seen this many people gathered for peace since Vietnam," said Pat McPeak, a St. Paul school nurse.</p>

<p>The protesters included 15-month-old Graham Markert of Minneapolis, who attended his first peace rally snuggled inside a backpack carried by his mother, and Ruth Zack, 76, of St. Paul, who huddled against the cold with other senior citizens on the Capitol steps.</p>

<p>The peace themes of the rally highlighted what many viewed as conflicting interests: corporations, oil companies and the country's wealthiest citizens &#151; vs. education, health and housing for the average taxpayer.</p>

<p>Fran Conklin, 56, an educator from St. Paul, carried a sign with a message that expressed the sentiment of many of the marchers: "Remember Paul, work for peace."</p>

<p>Another sign, carried by Eileen Watson of Eagan, said, "I walk silently to honor the memory of &#133; Paul Wellstone, who courageously opposed war with Iraq despite political cost."</p>

<p>While many of the marchers had planned to attend the protest weeks ahead of time, it was clear the rally was as much a memorial tribute to Wellstone as it was a demonstration against war.</p>

<p>"It's a validation of what he did," said Jim Tincher of Minneapolis.</p>

<p>"I think everyone here has come with two things in mind: to show respect for the man and to protest war," added Tincher, who marched with his wife, Susan, and children Danny, 7, and Rebecca, 5.</p>

<p>Some marchers said they wished the upcoming election could be postponed to allow more time to grieve Wellstone's death. Most said they had not had time to think about a Democratic replacement. Those who did mentioned a potential candidate named Walter Mondale.</p>

in St. Paul, Minn., Saturday, Oct. 26, 2002. A vote against war was Wellstone's 

first major vote in the Senate when he arrived in 1991, and a vote against war 

in Iraq was his last major vote before his death in a plane crash near Eveleth, 

Minn., Friday. (AP Photo/Ann Heisenfelt) <br>

</table></font>Some Minnesotans who attended the rally said they doubt Iraq poses a threat as serious as that alleged by the Bush administration.</p>

<p>"I don't think they have a weapon of mass destruction that they could launch that could be a threat to us," said Jean Coleman of Minneapolis, who marched with her husband, Brian Ross, and children, Sara Ross, 9, and Samuel Ross, 8.</p>

<p>Memories of the Vietnam War era resonated in the crowds' chants ("Peace. Now!") and songs ("All we are saying is give peace a chance"), as well as in the minds of many participants.</p>

<p>"I'm old enough to remember Vietnam, and what we learned then was that sometimes our own government lies to us," Conklin said.</p>

<p>"I believe it is a terrible regime in Iraq and that he (Hussein) may indeed be as heinous as Hitler, but I also have to believe there are choices other than war," said Sara BernickLangworthy, an artist and mother of two from St. Paul who recently joined Women Against Military Madness, one of the march sponsors. "I think there are always diplomatic options."</p>

<p>Like many of the rally participants, she spoke of the need for the United States to develop alternative energy sources to decrease its dependence on oil.</p>

<p>Speakers at the event challenged the crowd to stop a war against Iraq, despite the congressional approval recently given to President Bush for pre-emptive action.</p>

<p>Actor Josh Hartnett, who is from St. Paul, spoke briefly, making an unscheduled appearance at the rally.</p>

<p>"I came here to support a man named Paul Wellstone," he said. "We can still support his policies. Just get out there and vote, and let's make a difference."</p>

<p>"Although the war was preplanned and preapproved, we will stop it," promised Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, a University of St. Thomas professor of justice and peace studies, who was keynote speaker for the event.</p>
