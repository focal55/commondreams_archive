<p>President Bush&#146;s appearance Friday in Springfield attracted plenty of 

Republican faithful and proved an irresistible attraction to some opposed to his 

policies.

<p> More than 400 protesters and activists stood with placards, banners and dress 

that expressed their displeasure.

<p> There were no physical confrontations between the protesters and the few Bush 

and Talent backers who mingled with the crowd outside Hammons Student Center on 

the Southwest Missouri State University campus during the two hours the demonstrators 

roamed outside.

<p> But plenty of impromptu street-corner debates broke out, including a loud 

one between the protesters and a group of young cheerleaders who came to show 

their spirited support for the president.

<p> &#147;USA!&#148; the cheerleaders yelled from one side of the street.

<p> &#147;Stop the bombing,&#148; the crowd shouted back from the other side.

<p> The vocal volleys continued until it eventually sounded like both sides were 

yelling for the same cause &#151; &#147;USA! Stop the bombing! USA! Stop the bombing!&#148;

<p> &#147;I&#146;m a cheerleader, too,&#148; said Christine Schilling of Springfield, 

dressed in black and riding a bicycle, as she peered at the cheerleaders behind 

a cyclone fence. 

<p> &#147;I&#146;m cheering for the future of our country. This is my uniform. 

I just happen to be a sad cheerleader.&#148;

<p> Demonstrators and activists marched, chanted and carried signs denouncing 

the act of war and Bush&#146;s push to use military force against Iraq. 

<p> Two other groups were demonstrating against the environmental and Social Security 

stands taken by Jim Talent, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate.

<p> The focus of most of the protesters&#146; attention was on Bush.

<p> They were dressed in black. Some wore masks, carried baby dolls wrapped in 

black cloth or painted their faces black and white. Almost everyone toted a sign 

that called for no war.

<p> One carried a U.S. flag that contained corporate logos instead of stars.

<p> &#147;Give peace a chance,&#148; a man yelled.

<p> Some stood in long black robes and looked to have dyed their hair black to 

complete the somber effect. They shook their signs at buses that arrived with 

guests for the political rally.

<p> A woman played protest songs on a guitar. Two other women danced in the grass 

and recited anti-war and anti-Bush poetry. 

<p> &#147;I&#146;m so glad (Bush) came to town. It&#146;s exciting to know so 

many people share our feelings. I&#146;m very pleased and hopeful, maybe,&#148; 

said Joan Collins, the organizer of the peace march.

<p> &#147;Americans really do care. People in Springfield really do care.&#148;

<p> The 400 protesters sparked a protest of their own.

<p> Brian Helt clearly didn&#146;t like what he saw on the sidewalks ringing John 

Q. Hammons Student Center before and during the president&#146;s appearance.

<p> There was a sneer on the Marionville man&#146;s face and disdain in his voice 

as he scanned the crowd of demonstrators.

<p> &#147;I am protesting the protesters. I can&#146;t agree with any of them,&#148; 

the former military man said.

<p> &#147;I&#146;ll be called up to protect people like them and no, I wouldn&#146;t 

want to do that.&#148;

<p> Helt, who is in the Missouri National Guard and served in three branches of 

the military, engaged in a spirited debate with a young man who was against killing 

more people despite what happened on Sept. 11.

<p> &#147;You&#146;re afraid of my opinion,&#148; the man told Helt.

<p> &#147;You&#146;re protecting Saddam,&#148; Helt replied.

<p> The man then identified himself &#151; Ryan Amundson. His brother, Craig, 

was killed in the attack on the Pentagon.

<p> &#147;I&#146;m sorry about that,&#148; Helt said quietly and walked away.

<p> &#147;I understand where he&#146;s coming from,&#148; Amundson said. &#147;They 

think war will bring peace. But I think that&#146;s a big mistake. The attack 

on Iraq will not produce the effect we want.&#148;

<p> One of the oldest protesters was Lee Fetter, 76, who grew up in Richmond, 

Va., where her mother, Rose Caplan, used to work to have the poll tax repealed.

<p> &#147;She was out in the black neighborhoods campaigning, telling people they 

shouldn&#146;t have to pay to vote,&#148; she said.

<p> &#147;When I was driving down here today, I was thinking Mama is here with 

me.&#148;

<p> The protesters, despite being told to move back from the sidewalks when Bush&#146;s 

entourage left the center, surged against the yellow police tape and screamed 

as the president drove by and waved to them.

<p> Marlene Colony, who came from the Tampa, Fla., area to rally against war, 

was in the crowd dodging raindrops that began to fall just before Bush left.

<p> She came to Springfield to be with family and friends and said anti-war sentiments 

are growing around the country. 

<p> &#147;I&#146;m here to help wake our brothers up. It&#146;s time all stood 

up for peace,&#148; she said. &#147;People are standing up all over the country.&#148;
