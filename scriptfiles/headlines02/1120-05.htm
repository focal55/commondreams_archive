<p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 19 — An alliance of environmental and civil rights groups 

filed a federal lawsuit here today in a last-ditch effort to block the Army from 

burning tons of chemical weapons in a populated area.</p>

<P> The suit demands that the Army complete more environmental studies before 

proceeding with its plan to incinerate thousands of old shells containing nerve 

gas, mustard gas and other deadly agents at the Anniston Army Depot. The lawsuit 

contends that the plan should be halted so scientists can consider recently discovered, 

less risky alternatives. </p>

<P> The Army plans to begin destroying the weapons early next year. To stop the 

project, one of the issues the alliance must prove is that the weapons disposal 

poses an "imminent danger" to the community.</p>

<P> "To place this burden on us is unacceptable," said Brenda Lindell, a homemaker 

who has been active in local causes in Anniston, a city of 24,000 people 58 miles 

east of Birmingham. "If there is an accident, there is no way to protect us. What 

about our children? What about our elderly? What about those of us who like to 

be outside?"</p>

<P> To help make Anniston residents feel better, local officials said they would 

pass out gas masks and duct tape to seal homes. That made most people feel worse.</p>

<P> "They know it's not safe or they wouldn't be doing do that," said the Rev. 

Abraham Woods, president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership 

Conference. "And I hate to play the race card, but it's always in communities 

with high proportions of minorities that the government is committed to using 

outdated, dangerous technologies."</p>

<P> Anniston is about half white and half black.</p>

<P> The Army, which houses 9 percent of the nation's chemical weapon stockpile 

at the Anniston Army Depot, says that its process of burning chemical weapons 

at 2,700 degrees is completely safe and that no fumes that could hurt the public 

will be released.</p>

<P> "The project has already safely eliminated 25 percent of the nation's total 

stockpile, including 38 percent of all munitions using the current technology," 

said Michael B. Abrams, spokesman for the Anniston Chemical Agent Disposal Facility.</p>

<P> Local officials, though, say they are not ready for the burning to begin. 

They are still waiting to obtain bids for gas masks and other equipment. The project 

has already been delayed several months.</p>

<P> Opponents of the plan called a news conference today on the steps of the federal 

courthouse in downtown Birmingham, where the suit was filed, but the turnout was 

sparse.</p>

<P> Several environmental lawyers accused the Army of taking advantage of what 

they called Alabama's lax environmental laws and its image as backwoods and poor.</p>

<P> "They're treating us like a third world country," said Byron Bart Slawson, 

who helped draft the suit.</p>

<P> There are other plants that burn old chemical weapons, including ones on Johnston 

Island in the Pacific Ocean and at Tooele, Utah, in the Great Salt Lake Desert. 

But none are in populated areas. The Anniston plant is in a hilly region surrounded 

by churches, parks, schools, fast-food restaurants and homes.</p>

<P> Despite the repeated assurances from Army officials, people here expect trouble. 

They have been told that a shrill whoop-whoop is the most serious of several public-address 

siren tones, signaling a major disaster. They have studied evacuation plans.</p>

<P> Army officers now acknowledge that more than 800 mortar shells and M-55 rockets 

are leaking, though only trace amounts, of deadly nerve gas.</p>

<P> The lawsuit, which seeks a preliminary injunction against the Army, is similar 

to suits filed in other states, including one pending in Oregon, but few have 

prevailed.</p>

<P> The Anniston suit has three parts, with the first arguing that the government 

is obligated, under federal environmental law, to research safer alternatives 

to burning weapons.</p>

<P> In the past few years, scientists have discovered how to neutralize weapons 

with chemicals, but the last environmental impact study the Army did for the Anniston 

plant was in 1995, before much of that research was done.</p>

<P> The second part of the suit says burning weapons creates "imminent and substantial 

endangerment to public health." The third says the Army "knowingly misrepresented 

and underestimated the risks and impacts" of the emissions on minority populations.</p>

<P> Mr. Abrams, the Army spokesman, declined to comment on the specifics of the 

lawsuit.</p>
