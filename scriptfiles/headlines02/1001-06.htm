<p>WASHINGTON &#150;&#150; Iraq's bioweapons program that President Bush wants 

to eradicate got its start with help from Uncle Sam two decades ago, according 

to government records getting new scrutiny in light of the discussion of war against 

Iraq. 

<P>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent samples directly to several 

Iraqi sites that U.N. weapons inspectors determined were part of Saddam Hussein's 

biological weapons program, CDC and congressional records from the early 1990s 

show. Iraq had ordered the samples, claiming it needed them for legitimate medical 

research. 

<P>The CDC and a biological sample company, the American Type Culture Collection, 

sent strains of all the germs Iraq used to make weapons, including anthrax, the 

bacteria that make botulinum toxin and the germs that cause gas gangrene, the 

records show. Iraq also got samples of other deadly pathogens, including the West 

Nile virus. 

<P>The transfers came in the 1980s, when the United States supported Iraq in its 

war against Iran. They were detailed in a 1994 Senate Banking Committee report 

and a 1995 follow-up letter from the CDC to the Senate. 

<P>The exports were legal at the time and approved under a program administered 

by the Commerce Department. 

<P>"I don't think it would be accurate to say the United States government deliberately 

provided seed stocks to the Iraqis' biological weapons programs," said Jonathan 

Tucker, a former U.N. biological weapons inspector. 

<P>"But they did deliver samples that Iraq said had a legitimate public health 

purpose, which I think was naive to believe, even at the time." 

<P>The disclosures put the United States in the uncomfortable position of possibly 

having provided the key ingredients of the weapons America is considering waging 

war to destroy, said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. Byrd entered the documents into 

the Congressional Record this month. 

<P>Byrd asked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld about the germ transfers at 

a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Byrd noted that Rumsfeld met 

Saddam in 1983, when Rumsfeld was President Reagan's Middle East envoy. 

<P>"Are we, in fact, now facing the possibility of reaping what we have sown?" 

Byrd asked Rumsfeld after reading parts of a Newsweek article on the transfers. 

<P>"I have never heard anything like what you've read, I have no knowledge of 

it whatsoever, and I doubt it," Rumsfeld said. He later said he would ask the 

Defense Department and other government agencies to search their records for evidence 

of the transfers. 

<P>Invoices included in the documents read like shopping lists for biological 

weapons programs. One 1986 shipment from the Virginia-based American Type Culture 

Collection included three strains of anthrax, six strains of the bacteria that 

make botulinum toxin and three strains of the bacteria that cause gas gangrene. 

Iraq later admitted to the United Nations that it had made weapons out of all 

three. 

<P>The company sent the bacteria to the University of Baghdad, which U.N. inspectors 

concluded had been used as a front to acquire samples for Iraq's biological weapons 

program. 

<P>The CDC, meanwhile, sent shipments of germs to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission 

and other agencies involved in Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. It 

sent samples in 1986 of botulinum toxin and botulinum toxoid &#150; used to make 

vaccines against botulinum toxin &#150; directly to the Iraqi chemical and biological 

weapons complex at al-Muthanna, the records show. 

<P>Botulinum toxin is the paralyzing poison that causes botulism. Having a vaccine 

to the toxin would be useful for anyone working with it, such as biological weapons 

researchers or soldiers who might be exposed to the deadly poison, Tucker said. 

<P>The CDC also sent samsamples of a strain of West Nile virus to an Iraqi microbiologist 

at a university in the southern city of Basra in 1985, the records show.
