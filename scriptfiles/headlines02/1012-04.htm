            <p>Scores of anti-war protesters waved signs and chanted slogans as 

              they surrounded San Francisco's federal building Friday to denounce 

              Congress' vote authorizing President Bush to wage war against Iraq.

</table></font>Federal officers arrested 44 people for blocking entrances to the 

              building shortly before 8 a.m., preventing thousands of federal 

              workers from getting to their jobs. Forty-two were cited for civil 

              disobedience and released. Two protesters were arrested on felony 

              charges of attacking an assistant U.S. attorney and a court security 

              officer. 

            <P>Nonetheless, it was a relatively peaceful protest and some people 

              there to do business didn't mind the disruption. 

            <P>Erik Babcock, a defense attorney who was trying to get into the 

              building, said he sided with the demonstrators. "I'm with their 

              sentiments," he said. 

            <P>The protest began Thursday afternoon after both houses of Congress 

              voted overwhelming to give Bush the go-ahead to use military force 

              against Saddam Hussein's regime. 

            <P>About 225 people marched from Montgomery and Market streets up 

              to the federal building where about 200 protesters, armed with blankets, 

              tents and sleeping bags, camped out overnight on the plaza in front 

              of the building. 

            <P>After Friday morning's protests, a band of about 50 demonstrators 

              marched to Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office to protest her voting 

              for the resolution giving Bush war powers. San Francisco police 

              detained one demonstrator. 

            <P>The number of protesters was far less than the 8,000 who attended 

              Sunday's anti-war rally at San Francisco's Union Square. But Medea 

              Benjamin, founding director of Global Exchange, a national anti-war 

              group based in San Francisco that helped sponsor both protests, 

              called the turn-out for the latest one "amazing" considering it 

              was hastily organized to coincide with the votes in Congress. 

            <P>"This is starting to feel like Vietnam in terms of the level of 

              protests," she said. "The one difference is that we're trying to 

              stop a war" before it happens.</p>
