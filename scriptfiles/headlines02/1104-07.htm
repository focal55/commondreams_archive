<p>Human rights activists and Florida lawmakers are pressing the United States 

administration of President George W. Bush to immediately reverse an 11-month 

old policy to keep all Haitian immigrants applying for political asylum in detention 

until their cases are heard. 

<p>

The detention of 235 Haitians who jumped from a freighter in Biscayne Bay, on Florida's



east coast, and swam to shore Tuesday has prompted major new protests against the policy which does not apply to those arriving from any other country.

 

<p> "I can think of few other actions taken by our federal government in recent 

decades that are so blatantly discriminatory and which so seriously call into 

question our nation's commitment to civil rights," wrote Dr. Dorothy Height, chair 

of the <a href="http://www.civilrights.org/" target="_new">Leadership Conference 

on Civil Rights</a>, in a letter to Bush Friday." 

<p>

 





"[T]here is still, unfortunately, a persisting belief held by some in our country that it is somehow acceptable at times to redraw the lines of the Constitution to exclude groups of people from its guarantees," she noted, describing the summary detention of the Haitian group at Krome Detention Center in Miami as "cruel and humiliating."

 <p>

 





Although the group was permitted contact with lawyers and brief telephone calls with relatives Friday, their supporters are worried that they will be treated in the same way as a similar group of 167 Haitians whose boat ran aground off one of the Florida Keys last December.

 

<p> According to the New York-based <a href="http://www.nchr.org/" target="_new">National 

Coalition for Haitian Rights</a> (NCHR), more than 90 percent of those detainees 

have been denied asylum and are awaiting deportation. It was their treatment which 

brought to light a new Justice Department policy to deny parole to all Haitians 

who arrive in the U.S. without documents until they are granted asylum. 

<p>

 





Under U.S. law, all Cubans who reach land in the U.S. are permitted to remain in the country and apply for permanent residency after one year.

 <p>

 





"In light of this new incident, we are now even more determined to renew our fight against this Haitians-only detention and deportation policy and will push for our people's right to fair treatment, representation, and due process," said NCHR's executive director, Dina Paul Parks.

 <p>

 





Until last December, Haitians, like immigrants from other countries, were usually released into the community once they had filed for asylum. But the administration, citing fears of a mass exodus from the impoverished Caribbean nation, issued a new regulation decreeing that all Haitian applicants remain in detention until their claim was decided.

 <p>

 





The new controversy comes at a key moment in the politics of Florida state where Governor Jeb Bush, the president's brother, hopes to be reelected Tuesday in a tight race against Democrat Bill McBride. McBride himself wrote to the president Thursday asking him to issue an executive order releasing the new arrivals pending their asylum hearings, as did Bob Graham, Florida's most senior senator who also served as governor of the state.

 <p>

 





They were backed by other Democrat officeholders and candidates, as well as by two Cuban-American Republican congressmen who also called for Haitians to be "afforded all procedural rights, in order to ensure that they are not summarily deported."

<p>







But the White House said it would not intervene in the case, with some administration officials complaining that Democrats were trying to take political advantage by mobilizing South Florida's large black population in advance of Tuesday's vote.

<p>







Some of the administration's allies in the media, notably on <i>The Wall Street Journal's</i> editorial page, suggested that the arrival of the freighter was timed precisely by the Haitian government of President Jean Bertrand Aristide to damage Governor Bush's campaign and embarrass the president.

<p> The U.S., along with other major international donors, has held up hundreds 

of millions of dollars in economic and development aid to press Port-au-Prince 

into compromising with its political opposition and implementing far-reaching 

economic reforms. The Aristide government has insisted that the aid embargo is 

further impoverishing what is already the Western hemisphere's poorest country 

by far.</p>
