<p> Most folks in Arkansas probably had never heard of the <a href="http://www.clw.org" target="_new">Council 

for a Livable World</a> (CLW) before this summer. Or in Minnesota, Colorado and 

New Hampshire.</p>

    <p>But the Republicans are out to change that.</p>

    <p>"Their name sounds reasonable, but their ideas are radical," declares a GOP ad that has been running in Arkansas. And "this dangerous group" is supporting Democratic Senate nominee Mark Pryor in his race against incumbent Tim Hutchinson (R).</p>

    <p>Similar salvos may be fired at Sen. Paul D. Wellstone (D-Minn.), who is battling to keep his seat, and Democratic Senate nominees Tom Strickland in Colorado and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire.</p>

    <p>So, who are these people?</p>

    <p>Created at the height of the Cold War to promote arms control, the CLW has aged into a dependable critic of Pentagon budgets and ballistic missile defense. And like a lot of Washington interest groups, the council encourages its supporters to write checks for friendly House and Senate candidates. When a pile of checks accumulates, the CLW "bundles" them up and sends them along, a perfectly legal practice that ensures the candidates will remember who raised the dough.</p>

    <p>A recent change in the disclosure rules means that this year, it's possible to figure out who is bundling for whom. Analysts at the National Republican Senatorial Committee determined that Pryor has received about $70,000 from CLW, while Shaheen was given about $65,000 and Strickland more than $50,000. Wellstone, much beloved by the council, has cashed a bundle of checks totaling more than $83,000 -- "the granddaddy of 'em all," said NRSC spokesman Dan Allen.</p>

    <p> Someone seeing the ad in Arkansas might conclude that the Republicans are looking for a way to politicize the war effort. "This dangerous group advocates massive defense cuts even while we're at war," the narrator intones. But Allen insisted that's not the intent. Cuts endorsed by the CLW would mean idle defense contractors in the targeted states.</p>

    <p>"This is a jobs issue," he said.</p>
