<p>The American public is sharply divided on whether President Bush has a clear policy on Iraq -- with 45 percent saying he does and 42 percent saying he does not, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Monday. <p>Three-fourths in the poll said Bush should get authorization from Congress before launching an attack, compared with the two-thirds who said just before the 1991 Persian Gulf War that his father, President George H.W. Bush, should get such authorization before attacking Iraq. <p>Those in the new survey also were about evenly split on whether the final decision should be made by Bush, 48 percent, or Congress, 44 percent. <p>The poll also found: <p>* Seven in 10, 69 percent, support military action against Iraq, but that number drops to 54 percent if U.S. allies oppose such action. <p>* More than half, 57 percent, support a U.S. invasion of Iraq with ground troops, but that drops to 40 percent if it would cause "a significant number of casualties." <p>* Political partisanship is strongest on views of whether Bush's policy on Iraq is clear. Two-thirds of Republicans say it is, but only one-third of Democrats and independents feel that way. <p>The poll of 1,023 adults was taken Wednesday through Sunday and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
