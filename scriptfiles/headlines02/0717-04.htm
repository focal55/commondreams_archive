<p>BRATTLEBORO -- Likening a new program to recruit 1 million citizen informants 

to Soviet-style repression, Sen. Patrick Leahy, said Tuesday he will have some 

tough questions for Justice Department leaders spearheading the effort.

<P> "I find it kind of scary," Leahy told the Reformer Tuesday about the little-known 

Operations TIPS, the Terrorism Information and Prevention System, which is set 

to launch next month.

<P> According to a government Web site, TIPS "will be a nationwide program giving 

millions of American truckers, letter carriers, train conductors, ship captains, 

utility employees, and others a formal way to report suspicious terrorist activity."

<P> "We used to laugh at the old Soviet Union idea where everybody reported everybody 

else," said Leahy. " ... We don't need to have it happen here. "

<P> The Vermont Democrat, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he will 

challenge Attorney General John Ashcroft on the need for TIPS when Ashcroft appears 

before the committee next week.

<P> Federal officials are releasing little information about the program. But 

the Web site, www.citizencorps.gov, indicates Citizen Corps is a component of 

the president's USA Freedom Corps program introduced by Bush in his State of the 

Union address in January that called on Americans to donate 4,000 hours of volunteer 

time.

<P> "Citizen Corps creates opportunities for individuals to volunteer to help 

communities bring together a network of volunteers and first responders at the 

local levels," Debbie Garrett, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management 

Agency in Washington, told the Reformer Tuesday.

<P> One of the five parts of the Department of Justice Program includes Operations 

TIPS, which the Washington Times described Tuesday as "a national reporting pilot 

program scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants 

-- or nearly 4 percent of Americans -- initially participating in the program."

<P> "Not everyone can volunteer for this," Garrett said of TIPS. "You have to 

be chosen as part of selected industries to be on the lookout for suspicious and 

terrorist-related activity. They put that information into a toll-free number 

that goes to 911 to help out local law enforcement."

<P> According to the Web site, the system will allow workers "whose routines make 

them well-positioned to recognize unusual events, to report suspicious activity."

<P> Participants are promised an Operation TIPS information sticker to be affixed 

to the cab of their vehicle or placed in some other public location so that the 

toll-free reporting number is readily available.

<P> "Everywhere in America, a concerned worker can call a toll-free number and 

be connected directly to a hotline routing calls to the proper law enforcement 

agency or other responder organizations when appropriate," the Web site states.

<P> But Leahy said he finds the pan implausible.

<P> "The idea that they're going to have some huge data bank where everybody -- 

from a next door neighbor who may have a gripe toward you because of your dog 

barking, to the person who fixes the cable in your house and doesn't like some 

of the books you're reading -- that they're going to report this into some data 

bank in Attorney General Ashcroft's office really doesn't make me feel more secure," 

Leahy said. 

<P> "Trained FBI agents had (information about) radical Islamic fundamentalists 

trying to learn how to fly airplanes and they couldn't handle that, but suddenly 

they're going to be able to handle thousands of unsubstantiated tips from the 

person reading your electric meter? ... This doesn't make us more secure. I think 

this turns us into a nation of paranoids."

<P> Leahy said he will question Ashcroft about the program next week when the 

attorney general appears before the judiciary committee.

<P> The Washington Post, too, posed a few questions about the program in a July 

14 editorial. "What sort of home activities will the government be urging workers 

to report to authorities? And what incentives, if any, will be used to encourage 

volunteers," the editorial asks.

<P> Joel Barkin, a spokesman for Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., said the congressman, 

who was not aware of the program before Tuesday, has some doubts.

<P> "Congressman Sanders be-lieves that the effort to make this county as safe 

as possible needs to be vigorous, but we should be very cautious about any proposal 

that undermines the democratic principles which we as a nation are fighting to 

preserve," Barkin said. "It certainly is raising some serious concerns."

<P> What remained unclear Tuesday was whether the program has been put in place, 

or whether it must be approved by Congress.

<P> Calls to the Department of Justice were not returned, and the FEMA spokeswoman 

declined to answer that question. 

<P> According to one source, however, Citizen's Corps' $50 million budget passed 

the House but remains in jeopardy in the Senate.

<P> Diane Derby, a spokeswoman for Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vermont, admitted the 

senator had not seen specifics about Citizen Corps. "We're happy that Sen. Leahy 

is the chair of judiciary and will be reviewing these issues," she said. 

<P> "In any area where we're responding to terrorism (Jeffords) does feel that 

everyone must be vigilant, but you've got to strike a good balance between the 

need for national safety and the need to ensure civil liberties, and that would 

hold true as he reviews this proposal," Derby added.
