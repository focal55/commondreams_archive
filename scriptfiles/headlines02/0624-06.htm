<p> If Tony Blair is lucky when he arrives in Kananaskis, Alberta, next Tuesday 

night for the annual summit of leaders from the world's eight most powerful economies, 

he might see a grizzly bear, a bald eagle, a cougar or wolf. One thing he is unlikely 

to see is any anti-globalization protesters.

</table></font>After last year's disastrous G8 summit in Genoa, when a 20-year-old demonstrator 

was shot dead by security forces, leaders pledged to go back to basics for future 

meetings. 

<P>Instead of expensive jamborees in cities - an easy target for "summit hoppers" 

in the anti-globalization movement - the G8 decided to return to the original 

concept proposed by the French president Val&#233;ry Giscard d'Estaing: a "fireside 

chat" between world leaders, the first of which took place in 1975 at Rambouillet, 

near Paris. 

<P>This year's summit host, the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr&#233;tien, has 

chosen the most remote fireside he could think of. Kananaskis is two hours away 

from the nearest big city, Calgary, and will be virtually impossible for protesters 

to reach. 

<P>A security cordon 13 miles wide has been thrown around the resort village. 

The hikers who usually throng its mountain trails in the summer have been warned 

to avoid the area, which will be swarming with police. 

<P>In a typically Canadian touch, the security forces will be armed not only with 

the normal anti-terrorist weapons, but also poop-scoops to ensure that the forests 

of Alberta are left in pristine condition. 

<P><B>Security concerns</B><BR>

The September 11 attacks have given the police more to worry about than the clean 

up. At one stage, it was rumored that George Bush might stay across the border 

in Montana because the White House was not happy about security in Kananaskis. 

Now, reassured by Canada's preparations, he has decided to stay with the rest 

of the gang. In this jittery environment, the village's small complex of luxury 

hotels has to be one of the safest places to hide world leaders. 

<P>As part of the back to basics approach, the summit will be on a smaller scale 

than previous events. Last year, Mr Bush traveled with a retinue of 800 government 

officials. This year, the total number of officials attending will be just 200. 

Most of the thousands of journalists covering the summit will not be allowed through 

the security cordon - they will be in Calgary, 80 miles away, with briefings conducted 

by video-link. 

<P>The anti-globalization movement's response is also likely to be more low-key. 

City authorities in Calgary have denied activists permission to set up a protest 

camp downtown, so the movement has decided to try to disrupt the Canadian capital, 

Ottawa instead. Only the most determined protesters are expected to try to penetrate 

the leaders' mountain fastness. 

<P>Even without the geographical challenge posed by the summit's location, the 

movement was already facing some tactical difficulties. 

<P>Last year's protests in Genoa were the culmination of an increasingly violent 

series of clashes which have marred global summits since the Seattle meeting of 

the World Trade Organization in December 1999. 

<P>Violent clashes at the World Bank's annual meeting in Prague eight months later 

gave a warning that parts of the European anti-globalization movement were becoming 

increasingly hardline. 

<P>But on the other side of the Atlantic, September 11 has changed the nature 

of protests. Some of the biggest groups in the North American anti-globalization 

coalition - unions, debt relief advocates and mainstream aid lobbyists - have 

decided that mass street marches involving confrontation with the police are no 

longer appropriate. 

<P>However, the real test of the new-style summit will not be whether the police 

manage to keep everything except for the wildlife at bay. Mr Blair and Mr Chr&#233;tien 

both promised last year that Africa would top the agenda in Kananaskis - but as 

the leaders prepare to fly to Canada, the world's poorest continent appears to 

be at risk of being sidelined by talks on terrorism, security and the Middle East. 

<P><B>The cost of conferring</B><BR>

When Japan hosted the G8 two years ago, officials decided the summit was a grand 

excuse to pump some money into discontented Okinawa, whose citizens were angry 

about a US military base on the island. However, the bill of &#163;500m was large 

even by the lavish standards of previous G8 shindigs. 

<P>Last year's Genoa summit cost the Italian government &#163;100m, though the 

lion's share went on enhancing security, including the installation of a missile 

defense system at the airport. 

<P>Kananaskis is supposed to be a slimmed-down summit, but the contrast between 

the cost of staging it and the pitiful amounts that leaders are likely to deliver 

for the world's poor will raise more questions about the relevance of the G8. 

<P>This year, the Canadian government estimates that its arrangements for the 

two-day summit will cost around &#163;140m. The opposition says feeding and housing 

the leaders and officials will cost tens of millions more. 

<P>The estimated total is, ironically, the same amount as Canada has donated to 

the G8's so-called "Marshall Plan for Africa". 

<P>Canada is the only country to have made a firm pledge on the plan for Africa 

ahead of Kananaskis. 

<P>Hopes that the summit will deliver anything like the sums which the US gave 

Europe in the original Marshall Plan look certain to be disappointed.</p>
