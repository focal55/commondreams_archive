<p>WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a shift from <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0717-09.htm">its 

position 24 hours earlier</a>, the U.S. Postal Service said Thursday it had decided 

to meet with the Justice Department to discuss Operation TIPS, a government plan 

to encourage U.S. postal workers to report suspicious activity as part of the 

government's war on terrorism.</b></p>

<p>USPS officials had said Wednesday their 800,000 employees would not participate 

in the proposed program, whose name is an acronym for Terrorist Information and 

Prevention System.</p>

<p>But the USPS explained Thursday, "That decision was made because we had insufficient 

information on the program, and because we had not discussed the issue internally 

or with the two unions affected."</p>

<p>In a statement, the postal service said it, the National Association of Letter 

Carriers and the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association agreed a meeting 

was necessary with Department of Justice representatives to discuss the initiative.</p>

<p>No meeting has been scheduled.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, Homeland Security officials approached the postal service 

about Operations TIPS and held a preliminary meeting about the possible involvement 

of letter carriers in the proposed initiative.</p>

<p>Plans for the program have raised concern across the political spectrum. Members 

of civil liberties and privacy groups have joined conservative groups in their 

condemnation of the proposed program, dubbing it "Operation Snoops."</p>
