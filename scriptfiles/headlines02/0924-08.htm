DC - The air above five of the most famous United States national parks is often 

more polluted than that of many urban areas, finds a new report released Monday 

by three conservation groups. The National Park Service countered with its own 

report, finding that the results of a 10 year study show that air quality is improving 

or remaining stable in more than half of the national parks monitored. 

<p>Both reports blame fossil fuel burning power plants, industrial facilities 

and motor vehicles for generating the smog and haze that threatens the health 

and beauty of the nation's parks. 

<p> The National Park Service (NPS) report "shows that in most parks, air quality 

exceeds standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency to protect public 

health and welfare," said NPS Director Fran Mainella. "Our findings also show 

that some parks occasionally experience pristine air quality conditions, unaffected 

by air pollution." 

<p> The best visibility, the NPS report found, occurs in Denali National Park 

in Alaska, and in an area centered around Great Basin National Park in Nevada. 

<p> However, Mainella acknowledged that more work needs to be done to improve 

air quality and visibility at many national parks. Air pollution now impairs visibility 

to some degree in every national park, she noted. 

<p> In 1977, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to establish a national goal of 

cleaning up the air over national parks and wildlands, called Class I areas. That 

goal has yet to be reached. 

<p> "Information in this report will help us to protect air quality related values 

from the adverse effects of air pollution by communicating information about air 

quality conditions in parks to the public and to state, federal and tribal authorities," 

Mainella said. 

<p> For more than 20 years, the NPS has been studying air quality in national 

park areas, with monitoring now underway at 60 NPS sites. The NPS air quality 

monitoring program provides information on ozone levels, acid rain and visibility 

impairment in parks. 

<p> The NPS report found that from 1990 to 1999, of the 28 parks that were monitored 

for visibility, 22 had improving visibility conditions on the clearest days. Ground 

level ozone concentrations were monitored at 32 parks, and the results show that 

while ozone levels in eight parks are improving, in 16 parks they are getting 

worse. 

<p> Acid rain monitoring was conducted in 29 parks, including testing for levels 

of sulfates and nitrates in rain and snow. Twenty-five parks are showing a decrease 

in sulfate levels, while 14 show a decrease in nitrate levels, the NPS report 

found. 

<p> The NPS report agreed with the report issued by the conservation groups in 

ranking the parks with the worst air pollution problems. "Code Red: America's 

Five Most Polluted National Parks," a report produced by the <a href="http://www.npca.org/" target="_new">National 

Parks Conservation Association</a> (NPCA), <a href="http://www.appvoices.org/" target="_new">Appalachian 

Voices</a>, and <a href="http://www.ocefoundation.org/" target="_new">Our Children's 

Earth</a>, uses an air pollution index, developed by Appalachian Voices for two 

earlier studies, to rank the five most polluted national parks based on haze, 

ozone and acid precipitation. 

<p> "In the Great Smoky Mountains, our most polluted national park, ozone pollution 

exceeds that of Atlanta, Georgia, and even rivals Los Angeles, California," said 

Harvard Ayers, chair of Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit conservation group focused 

on protecting forests and communities of the Appalachian Mountain region. 

<p> Besides Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina, 

the "Code Red" report names Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, Mammoth Cave 

National Park in Kentucky, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks in California, 

and Acadia National Park in Maine as the parks with the nation's worst air pollution. 

<p> All of these parks are also cited in the NPS report, titled "Air Quality in 

the National Parks." 

<p> The ways in which air pollution harms the parks varies. At Great Smoky Mountains, 

for example, ozone pollution has violated federal health standards more than 175 

times since 1998 and is damaging 30 species of plants. Acidic mountaintop clouds 

blanket spruce and fir tree forests, and saturate soils with excess nitrogen. 

<p> At Shenandoah National Park, visibility from Skyline Drive and the Appalachian 

Trail has shrunk to as little as one mile on smoggy summer days, and acid precipitation 

is ruining streams for native fish. At Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, 

ozone levels surpassed human health standards on 61 summer days in 2001, posing 

a risk to sequoia seedlings and blocking views of the Sierra mountain scenery. 

<p> The NPS report confirms that ozone injury to vegetation has been documented 

at Ozone injury to vegetation has been identified in Shenandoah, Great Smoky Mountains, 

Sequoia and Kings Canyon, as well as two additional national parks in California: 

Yosemite, and Lassen Volcanic National Park. 

<p> At Acadia National Park, scenic views are impaired and acid rain threatens 

streams and lakes. Acid rain is also a major problem at Mammoth Cave National 

Park, where it seeps through the porous karst rock to pollute underground streams 

and the unique wildlife that depends upon them. 

<p> The impacts of air pollution are evident throughout the National Park System, 

charge the groups behind the "Code Red" report. For example, Big Bend National 

Park in Texas was found to have some of the worst visibility in the western states, 

and air pollution at this park along the Mexican border is growing worse. Many 

other parks are not included in the report because they lack complete monitoring 

data, the groups noted. 

<p> Other types of air pollution, such as mercury deposits, pose risks at parks 

ranging from Acadia to the Everglades in southern Florida. Airborne pesticide 

residues from agricultural areas threaten park wildlife, the groups warn, and 

global warming caused by emissions of greenhouse gases could disrupt ecosystems 

in national parks. 

<p> Most park air pollution from human sources comes from burning fossil fuels 

such as coal, oil and natural gas, both reports agree. Power plants and industrial 

facilities, as well as cars, trucks, planes, trains and construction equipment, 

all produce fossil fuel pollution. 

<p> Power plant emissions vary by region, but this one industrial sector ranks 

among the worst polluters, particularly in the eastern half of the country, the 

reports note. For example, sulfate particles formed from sulfur dioxide emissions 

from fossil fuel combustion - mostly from electric generation facilities - accounts 

for 60 to 80 percent of the visibility impairment in the eastern parks and 30 

to 40 percent of the impairment in western states, the NPS report states. 

<p> Besides damaging visibility and natural resources at national parks, this 

pollution can also harm human health. 

<p> "New statistics from the World Health Organization show that in the United 

States, air pollution annually kills nearly twice as many people as do traffic 

accidents and that deaths from air pollution equal deaths from breast cancer and 

prostate cancer combined," said Tiffany Schauer, executive director of Our Children's 

Earth Foundation. 

<p> The "Code Red" report also assesses progress made during the decade since 

the passage of 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, the most recent changes to 

the law. 

<p> "National parks have seen little to no improvement despite the most recent 

amendments to the Clean Air Act," said Don Barger, NPCA's southeast regional director. 

"For example, pollution from outdated power plants continues to harm parks and 

people, when there's no reason older power plants cannot meet modern pollution 

control requirements." 

<p> NPS Director Mainella says the agency is working to improve air quality in 

parks by promoting pollution prevention practices in parks and reviewing permit 

applications for new and modified air pollution sources near parks. Yet just last 

month, the Department of Interior approved plans for a new coal fired power plant 

in western Kentucky that critics charge will increase air pollution at nearby 

Mammoth Cave National Park, which already suffers from some of the worst visibility 

in the nation. 

<p> The "Code Red" groups argue that the Bush administration could, and should, 

be doing more to clean up the air over national parks. 

<p> "Air pollution in the national parks is a national crisis that requires national 

solutions," said Joy Oakes, director of NPCA's Clean Air for Parks and People 

campaign. "A key part of the solution is for the Bush Administration to enforce 

existing pollution laws. Unfortunately, the Administration is abandoning programs 

essential to cleaning up the air in our parks and communities." 

<p> The groups argue that the Bush administration must implement and enforce existing 

programs of the Clean Air Act, such as the Regional Haze Rule, including the Best 

Available Retrofit Technology (BART) amendment and the New Source Review program. 

<p> Current Bush administration proposals would eliminate these basic programs, 

weakening provisions to protect parks, the groups charge, while President George 

W. Bush's plan for clean air protection, called the Clear Skies Initiative, will 

not do enough to protect air quality in national parks, the report says. 

<p> "Code Red" also makes a case for new federal legislation that would make "sizeable 

cuts in power plant emissions," including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury 

and carbon dioxide. New legislation is also needed to cut emissions from mobile 

sources such as cars and trucks, and to increase the fuel efficiency of motor 

vehicles. 

<p> Until these actions are taken on the federal level, the "Code Red" report 

urges states to find ways to protect themselves, such as controlling in state 

sources of pollution. Several states are already moving in this direction, the 

report notes. Earlier this year, California became the first state in the nation 

to control greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. 

<p> In June, North Carolina passed the Clean Smokestacks Act, requiring the state's 

power plants to slash sulfur dioxide emissions by 74 percent, and nitrogen oxide 

emissions by 78 percent. Similar legislation has been introduced by Democrats 

in the U.S. House and Senate, but has been stalled by Republican and White House 

opposition. 

<p> "Ironically, as North Carolina takes steps to improve air quality, the Bush 

Administration has proposed a major step backward - actually weakening the Clean 

Air Act," noted U.S. Representative David Price, a North Carolina Democrat. "So 

even though North Carolina will be doing its part to reduce pollution that causes 

ozone and acid rain, our state will continue to be stricken by pollution coming 

from other states." </p>
