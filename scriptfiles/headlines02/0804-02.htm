<p>EDISON, N.J. -- For 11 years, Robert Spiegel spent his nights creating elaborate 

wedding cakes and his days trying to force the government to clean up the arsenic, 

lead, dioxin and other lethal chemicals that saturate a six-acre lot nestled between 

suburban homes and a factory-sized bakery.

<p>His commitment seemed about to pay off when, after years of studies and planning, 

federal Environmental Protection Agency officials announced a $28.5-million cleanup 

of the site where Chemical Insecticide Corp. had once manufactured a range of 

deadly chemicals, including the components of Agent Orange. Work was to begin 

this fall.

<p>But a few months ago, local EPA officials told Spiegel not to expect the cleanup 

to begin soon. Then, last month, a report by the EPA inspector general named the 

Chemical Insecticide site as one of 33 priority Superfund sites in 19 states that 

had not received funding requested by EPA branch offices.

<p> "It's like getting the wind knocked out of you," said an outraged Spiegel, 

as he stood amid about 60 barrels of hazardous materials left at the site.

<p>With a number of sites around the country denied financing and the Superfund 

close to running out of money, there is growing concern at the grass-roots level 

that years of hard work to clean toxic waste sites may end in futility.

<p>Congress and President Carter created the Superfund program in 1980 in response 

to the public outcry over the toxic disaster at Love Canal in New York. The trust 

fund, which was financed through taxes on polluting industries and court awards 

for hazardous substance releases, provided money for cleanups on sites where the 

polluters could not be charged. By the program's 20th anniversary, 757 sites had 

been cleaned nationwide.

<p>But the fund is expected to be all but depleted by the end of next year, leaving 

it to scarce general tax revenue to pay for any further cleanups.

<p>Spiegel and other supporters of the program attribute the idleness at Chemical 

Insecticide and other toxic sites to the Bush administration's failure to renew 

the tax, which expired in 1995. President Clinton proposed renewing it, but the 

GOP-controlled Congress balked.

<p>"The perception that things are slowing down is arising from the fact that 

so much hysteria has been created ... in the community," said EPA spokesman Joe 

Martyak.

<p>Marianne L. Horinko, the assistant EPA administrator in charge of the Superfund 

program, called Spiegel's concerns "unfounded." "I'm not slowing anything down," 

she said.

<p>Since the inspector general's report, about half of the 33 Superfund sites 

have either been allocated some federal cleanup funds or determined to be not 

ready for cleanup. But at least 16 sites are still listed as ready, but without 

the funding.

<p>These stalled cleanups and the failure to reinstate the tax have contributed 

to growing grass-roots skepticism about the federal government's commitment to 

the program, according to local environmentalists and members of Congress with 

sites in their districts.

<p>"With the trust fund declining, there is a lot more uncertainty about future 

funding," said Karen N. Probst, the author of a congressionally ordered report 

released last year on the Superfund's future. "And with the Bush administration's 

environmental track record, when the Bush administration says they're committed 

to Superfund, people aren't that sure."

<p>If the government fails to clean up the Superfund sites quickly--after communities 

have slogged through the extensive application, testing and planning stages--the 

program's reputation could be undermined, said Probst, a senior fellow at Resources 

for the Future, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on the economics of 

environmental problems.

<p>"It took them 12 years to get to where they are," Probst said, referring to 

the activists in Edison, N.J. "The whole program's credibility will be hurt if 

there are projects in the pipeline for that long and then EPA has to stop cleanups."

<p>*

<p>First Visit in 1990

<p>On a recent afternoon, the back gate was wide open at the long-abandoned Chemical 

Insecticide Corp. The only indication of the potential danger inside was a sign 

face down in the dirt that read: "Danger no trespassing; hazardous substances 

present."

<p>In the 1950s and 1960s a variety of pesticides and herbicides, including DDT 

and the components of Agent Orange, were produced here and shipped as far as Vietnam. 

Excess chemicals were dumped into several large pits. Through the years, the chemicals 

migrated across the parking lot of a large bakery and into a brook that flows 

through an apartment complex.

<p>In 1969, when the plant was still functioning, six cows died after drinking 

water in that brook. The plant owner was fined $200, according to a newspaper 

article.

<p>The plant buildings were razed long ago. Nature appears to have reclaimed the 

site with shrubs, trees and weeds.

<p>Spiegel first visited the site in 1990 with a friend who was familiar with 

it. At the time, the property was not fenced despite the potential danger to people 

who lived in the neighborhood and the children who attended a nearby school.

<p>Rabbits with lime-green undercoats, apparently from exposure to the pesticide 

Dinoseb in the soil and water on the lot, hopped around the lot, Spiegel said. 

The EPA banned Dinoseb in 1986 because of the high risk of birth defects and other 

health problems. 

<p>Spiegel was appalled. What he saw that day inspired him and some friends to 

create the <a href="http://www.edisonwetlands.org/" target="_new">Edison Wetlands 

Assn.</a>, an environmental group.

<p>"Somebody had to do something about it," he said. "That somebody was me. I 

had no idea it would become my life's crusade."

<p>He gathered every document he could about the plant's history. One day when 

he was copying documents at the regional EPA office, the clerk assigned to help 

him felt ill and left him alone. He copied almost the entire contents of two file 

drawers. The next time he visited the office, most of those documents had been 

removed from public files.

<p>"They made some of the most dangerous stuff known to mankind here," Spiegel 

said.

<p>After much haranguing from Spiegel and his group, the EPA tested a nearby stream 

and found arsenic and other dangerous chemicals. As an interim effort in the mid-1990s 

to stop the spread of the toxic chemicals, the EPA dug up the stream bed and installed 

an impermeable cap, like a huge swimming pool cover, over the part of the site 

where hazardous chemicals were most concentrated.

<p>This has prevented the migration of most harmful chemicals. But these were 

supposed to be only temporary fixes until specialists could conduct tests to assess 

the extent of the contamination and plot the appropriate solution.

<p>Spiegel and the residents were delighted two years ago when the EPA proposed 

removing 106,000 cubic yards, enough to cover a football field with five stories 

of dirt, from the site. Detailed diagrams of the excavation were completed and 

the community approved plans to move the dirt on trucks.

<p>Now the EPA has put that plan back on the shelf.

<p>Edison Mayor George Spadorois is considering filing suit against the EPA for 

breaking its contract with the community.

<p>"What's happened here is outrageous," he said. "They've done a terrible injustice 

to Edison."

<p>Meanwhile, the cap has already passed its projected life span and is starting 

to break up in some places.

<p>"The longer it takes to clean it up, the more possibility that health impacts 

could get worse," said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), who represents Edison 

in Congress.

<p>Pallone said residents are right to be concerned about whether the government 

will make good on its promise to clean up hazardous sites at a time when the trust 

fund, which held $3.8 billion as recently as 1996, is down to its last $28 million.

<p>"People have no confidence; they know there is going to be no money in the 

trust fund next year," Pallone said. "The notion that we're going to rely on general 

revenue funds I think is nonsense. There's too much competition for that money."

<p>Horinko called the concerns about the tax a "red herring."

<p>"As long as they send me the dollars that I can use to get cleanup done, that's 

what matters to me," she said.

<p>Funding has remained flat for the program in recent years at about $1.2 billion 

a year, with money from general tax revenue supplementing the fund.

<p>Horinko and other EPA officials explained the stalled cleanups at Edison and 

the 15 other sites as routine consequences of budgeting priorities. They stressed 

that the government remains committed to the cleanups.

<p>But neither Horinko nor EPA officials in the region could specify when they 

would take place.

<p>One clue might come from Probst's report to Congress, which projected that 

Superfund cleanups would require an extra $200 million to $400 million per year 

in 2002 through 2004 on top of its $1.2-billion base level.

<p>Spiegel, for one, is not letting the setback deter him.

<p>This is the first year that Spiegel's group had the money to pay him a salary, 

and he has quit his baking job to press for cleanups of New Jersey's many toxic 

waste dumps full time. He is lobbying Congress to renew the Superfund tax, and 

he is trying to form alliances with like-minded groups around the country.

<p>He recently sent each member of the Senate Environment Committee a stuffed 

green rabbit. A note with each bunny declared: "It's not easy being green. Vote 

yes on the Superfund Tax." </p>
