<p>JERUSALEM -- Dalia Rabin-Pelosoff, daughter of the assassinated Israeli leader 

who signed the Oslo peace accord, resigned her post as deputy defense minister 

Tuesday in protest of the army's reoccupation of Palestinian towns in the West 

Bank. 

<P>Rabin-Pelosoff, whose father Yitzhak Rabin struck the historic deal with Palestinian 

leader Yasser Arafat in 1993, was named deputy defense minister in the coalition 

government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon last year. An Israeli extremist opposed 

to Rabin's willingness to trade land for peace killed the elder Rabin in 1995. 

<P>Rabin-Pelosoff had been urging her moderate Labor party to withdraw from the 

coalition, but Labor opted to remain in the coalition with Sharon's hard- line 

Likud party. 

<P>Her resignation is the latest sign of growing discontent among Israeli liberals, 

who believe that Sharon wants to dismember Arafat's Palestinian Authority. 

<P>Sharon, on the other hand, denies that he aims to destroy the authority and 

says he will withdraw Israeli troops once Palestinian attacks against Israeli 

civilians stop. He has insisted that all violence stop before peace talks are 

resumed. No formal negotiations have been held since he took office in March of 

last year. 

<P>Rabin-Pelosoff has been unhappy with the army's recent re-occupation of seven 

of eight Palestinian cities in the West Bank following a string of Palestinian 

suicide attacks in June, Sharon's reluctance to reopen peace talks with the Palestinians 

and the government's decision to isolate Arafat. 

<P>"The government decided that Arafat is not relevant," she told Israel television 

in December. "This is not my opinion. In the end, we will have to speak to someone." 

<P>Although she had originally intended to resign two weeks ago, media reports 

said she had waited until Tuesday at the behest of Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, 

who is also the Labor party leader. The Israeli air strike that killed the military 

head of the Islamic group Hamas and 14 other Palestinians in the Gaza Strip Tuesday 

had nothing to do with her decision, political sources say. 

<P>In her resignation letter, Rabin-Pelosoff wrote that she could not "in all 

good conscience" remain in a government that did not continue the legacy of her 

late father and that the national unity government "had reached its end." 

<P>Labor party Secretary General Ophir Pines-Paz praised her decision Tuesday 

in an interview with Army Radio, saying that he knew "she had been deliberating 

over the issue for a long time and was suffering for the past few months. She 

could no longer be part of this government, which tells the Israeli public that 

there are no solutions to our problems."
