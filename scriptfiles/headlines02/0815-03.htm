<p> WASHINGTON — President George W. Bush's boldest attempt yet to restore faith 

in the American economy has crashed and burned, denounced by a chorus of voices 

as futile and self-serving.

<P></P>

From San Francisco to Des Moines, New York to Houston, newspaper editorials eviscerated 

Bush's half-day economic summit in Waco, Texas. Business leaders and economic 

analysts condemned the effort as weak and devoid of ideas.

<P></P>

The New York Times' Maureen Dowd began her column: "President Bush tried to fix 

the economy before lunch yesterday."

<P></P>

The Washington Post's editorial was equally sarcastic, noting that "among the 

adoring Cabinet officers and supportive business executives ... there was a range 

of opinion: Some people thought Mr. Bush is doing a magnificent job, while others 

insisted that he is doing an extremely magnificent job."

<P></P>

Tuesday's event, heavily promoted by the White House, was clearly the biggest 

mistake on the domestic front to date in Bush's presidency, said David Kusnet, 

a visiting fellow with the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute in Washington.

<P></P>

"It was a media event which generated terrible media coverage and, even while 

the president was speaking there, the stock market was tumbling," Kusnet said.

<P></P>

"I don't think you can build confidence just by telling people to have it, and 

telling them to ignore their own personal economic experiences."

<P></P>

Some of those who've had the personal economic experience of unemployment said 

the event, which they watched live on CSPAN, left them empty. Mike Nunez of Houston 

voted for Bush in the 2000 presidential election. He lost his $100,000-a-year 

(U.S.) computer software sales job last year.

<P></P>

"A lot of people like me are sitting around and wondering when any action will 

be taken. I'm thoroughly disappointed," he told the Houston Chronicle.

<P></P>

As it turned out, the most astute political observer of all may have been <i>Doonesbury 

</i>cartoonist Garry Trudeau, who has been running a series of scathing cartoon 

strips for more than a week now mocking Bush's summit.

<P></P>

As Trudeau predicted, the Waco event was heavily scripted. Participants, who were 

rigorously screened — no Democrats were allowed in — were given "talking points" 

written by White House senior staffers.

<P></P>

Not a single participant criticized Bush's tax cut, which, combined with the war 

in Afghanistan and the slumping economy, has wiped out the federal surplus and 

left a huge and growing budget deficit.

<P></P>

One participant, Raleigh, N.C., restaurant owner Van Eure, gushed to Bush at a 

summit session: "I'm just proud to be sitting next to one of my heroes." The comment 

"seemed to sum up the tone of the forum," the Post noted dryly.

<P></P>

Other summit participants, including CEOs and company presidents, read messages 

crafted by trade associations with close ties to the White House. Bush, meanwhile, 

made a few jokes about the Texas summer heat and scribbled down notes, but didn't 

raise any serious new economic proposals for discussion.

<P></P>

Bush's much-ballyhooed summit failed to restore confidence, even temporarily. 

Hours after it ended, stock markets suffered more losses, with the Dow Jones industrial 

average down 206.5 points, the NASDAQ composite index down 37.6 points and the 

Standard & Poors 500 down 19.59 points. 

<P></P>

And, even while summit participant Charles Schwab, CEO of investment broker Charles 

Schwab and Co. Inc., was sitting beside Bush, his company was announcing 400 job 

cuts, the Times noted.

<P></P>

Bush and his advisers are desperate to avoid repeating the mistake Bush's father, 

the 41st president, is perceived to have made when he focused heavily on the Persian 

Gulf War and not the economy, and then was defeated by recession-weary voters 

after one term. The Waco summit was an attempt to show that Bush, the 43rd president, 

is actively trying to restore the economy.

<P></P>

But the tone of the commentary that rained down on Bush yesterday made it clear 

he is no longer the bulletproof president, immune to criticism, that he was in 

the months after Sept. 11. Recent polls have shown that, with the November mid-term 

elections looming, Americans rank the economy as their number one concern, far 

ahead of terrorism.

<P></P>

Bush continued his two-day Midwestern road trip yesterday, telling a gathering 

at the University of Wisconsin that Congress was contributing to the ailing U.S. 

economy with excessive spending that would impede growth. 

<P></P>

The U.S. president had interrupted his four-week Texas vacation to help raise 

nearly $2 million for Republican gubernatorial candidates in Wisconsin and Iowa, 

in advance of the November mid-term elections.</p>
