<p> United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan says the war against international terrorism can be legitimate only if approved by the Security Council. 

<P>

Mr Annan told the BBC that "when one is trying to deal with a broader threat to international peace and security, there is no alternative but to go through the [UN] Council".

<P>His remarks came as the US kept up the pressure on Iraq - the country that 

is expected to be the next target of the US-led campaign against terrorism. 

<P> President George W Bush on Thursday takes his case against Baghdad to the 

UN General Assembly, where he is expected to urge the international community 

to back his plans for military action. 

<P> On Tuesday, US Vice-President Dick Cheney spoke of possible links between 

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network. 

<P> In a videotaped message, Mr Cheney warned of dictators obtaining weapons of 

mass destruction and being prepared to share them with terrorists. 

<P><B>Legitimacy issue</B> 

<P>The UN Secretary General acknowledged that the UN Charter gave individual countries 

the right to self-defence. 

<P> "But, to contain the terrorists, I submit that you need that essential international 

co-operation to make it effective," Mr Annan said in the BBC interview. 

<P> He said "the threat we are dealing with, is much broader" and, as such, "you 

need the United Nations to be able to be effective". 

<P>"It is only the [UN Security] council that can provide the unique legitimacy 

that one needs to be able to act." 

<P> Mr Annan said it was important that any possible action against Iraq be "multilateral, 

which also means sanctioned by the Security Council. 

<P> "I think if one does it unilaterally, or with one or two countries, we don't 

know what happens at the end, the unexpected consequences of this conflict. Would 

Iraq remain intact? What happens in the region? How do we pick up the pieces? 

Who does it? All these issues are very critical that one should bear in mind." 

<P><B>Iraq's call</B> 

<P>"We are dealing with an issue of international law, it's an issue of international 

legitimacy, it's an issue of ensuring that there is some order in this difficult 

world we live in. If you do not have these rules, I think the world would be a 

very difficult place to manage." 

<P> Mr Annan's remarks - on the anniversary of the 11 September attacks against 

the US - are expected to refocus international attention on the widespread unease 

at the US plans to oust Saddam Hussein. 

<P> Iraq has called for Arabs to strike back at American lives and property if 

the US launches a military attack against Baghdad. 

<P> On Tuesday, Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan denounced US and British claims 

that Iraq was building banned weapons of mass destruction as "lies" and said UN 

inspectors would only be allowed back into Iraq as part of a comprehensive UN 

solution to the current crisis.
