has emerged in the United States that Vice-President Dick Cheney took part in 

a promotional video for the disgraced accounting firm Andersen. 

<P>

The news comes as an anti-corruption pressure group prepares to sue Mr Cheney for alleged fraudulent accounting practices.

<P>

In the video Mr Cheney  - then Chief Executive of the oil company Halliburton - describes how Andersen gave advice "over and above" what would normally be expected from auditors.

<P>Last month, the firm was convicted of obstructing justice by shredding documents relating to the failed US energy giant Enron.

<P>

The developments came hours after President George W Bush tried to distance himself from corporate fraud, proposing tougher penalties as a way of restoring confidence in the wake of recent business scandals that have shaken the US. 

<P>

<B>'Good advice'</B>

<P> The Andersen video, obtained by the Wall St Journal newspaper, is a further 

embarrassment for President Bush's administration.

<P> Correspondents say its business connections are fast becoming a serious liability. 

<P> The video was recorded in 1996. 

<P> "I get good advice, if you will, from their people based upon how we're doing 

business and how we're operating over and above the just sort of normal by-the-book 

auditing arrangement," Mr Cheney says in a short section of the video. 

<P> Andersen's reputation has been destroyed in recent weeks after it emerged 

that it had destroyed documents for one of its clients, Enron. 

<P> Enron has admitted to grossly exaggerating its profits to attract investors.

<P> <B>'Share overvaluation'</B> 

<P> In a separate development, pressure group Judicial Watch, says Mr Cheney deceived 

investors while he was a director of the oil company Halliburton in the 1990s. 

<P> <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/2088.shtml">In a case being filed in 

Dallas</a>, Texas, Mr Cheney is alleged to have engaged in practices which led 

to the overvaluation of the company's shares. 

<P> Judicial Watch says Mr Cheney deceived investors while he was a director of 

the oil company Halliburton in the 1990s. 

<P> It is also suing for access to records of Mr Cheney's energy task force that 

drew up the Bush administration's energy policy last year. 

<P> "To look the other way for the vice-president would be to set a precedent 

that the Washington elite are above the law," said Larry Klayman, chairman at 

Judicial Watch. 

<P> But Halliburton spokeswoman Wendy Hall said, "We don't believe the case has 

any merit." 

<P> Details of the lawsuit are likely to emerge during a news conference in Miami 

on Wednesday. 

<P><B>Harsher punishments</B> 

<P> In a speech in New York's financial district on Tuesday, President Bush said 

he wanted to tighten measures against corporate fraud. 

<P>He announced a doubling - to 10 years - of the maximum prison sentence, and 

the formation of a special investigative task force. 

<P> But Judicial Watch said that Mr Bush's rush to crack down on corporate fraud 

seemed intended to deflect attention away from his and Mr Cheney's own business 

practices. 

<P> Mr Bush has already faced questions about his work as a director of Texas-based 

Harken Energy Corp a decade ago, when the firm faced an inquiry for masking huge 

losses.
