<p>LONDON - British troops will start one of their biggest exercises in years 

this weekend amid speculation of a war with Iraq, but the government said a resolution 

to the crisis in the Gulf might not involve ousting Saddam Hussein.

<p>The Ministry of Defense said 6,000 troops will move to a  Royal Air Force base in eastern England on Sunday to kick off  Operation Log Viper.<p>Around 1,000 vehicles will be used during the month-long  exercise to cart tons of equipment through East Anglia and  southeast England. Some of it will be taken to a special  military port on the southern coast.<p>"It's the largest UK-based army exercise since 1998... it's  taking place over a massive area," a ministry spokesman said.<p>The ministry says the exercise has been planned for over a  year and is not related to the deepening crisis over Iraq.<p>It dismissed as "highly speculative" a report in the Daily  Telegraph newspaper which said troops would begin deploying to  Kuwait within two weeks in preparation for a possible attack.<p>President Bush turned up the heat on Saddam on Thursday,  urging the United Nations to force him to disarm and saying  action would follow if Baghdad failed to comply.<p>He has openly declared his intention to oust Saddam.<p>But in a further sign of differences between Washington and  London, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw said toppling the  Iraqi leader was not British policy.<p>Asked if a resolution to the crisis would necessarily mean  a change of leadership in Iraq, Straw, speaking from New York  on Thursday night, told BBC radio: "No it doesn't."<p>"You may get regime change as a consequence of military  action, you may get regime change as the only way of enforcing  the will of the United Nations, but the focus has to be on  these weapons of mass destruction," he said.<p>"If we can ensure by rigorous unconditional inspection that  Iraq is rid of those weapons of mass destruction, in a peaceful  way, then the argument about military action recedes."<p>However, he acknowledged something had to be done.<p>"We can't just allow Iraq to carry on in this way,  otherwise, as (U.N. Secretary-General) Kofi Annan said, we fail  to face up to our responsibilities."<p>"All of us...would dearly wish to be rid of Saddam  Hussein."<p>In his first public statements on the stand-off with  Baghdad, British finance minister Gordon Brown threw his weight  behind Prime Minister Tony Blair.<p>"I fully support the prime minister in all these issues and  I think that is well understood," he told the Financial Times.<p>Blair has alarmed many within his ruling Labor Party with  his unflinching support for Washington's tough line against  Iraq, which has refused to allow the return of U.N. arms  inspectors since 1998.<p>The prime minister warmly welcomed Bush's hawkish speech to  the United Nations on Thursday and said he would recall  parliament on September 24 to debate Iraq.

<p>More than 160 members in the 659-seat chamber of the parliament have signed 

a motion expressing "deep unease" about Britain backing military strikes.</span>
