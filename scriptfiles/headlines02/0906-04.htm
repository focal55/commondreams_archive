<p> Three major human rights groups said Wednesday that the United States should 

withhold at least US&#36;41 million in military aid to Colombia as a result of 

a failure by its armed forces to meet congressionally imposed conditions on delivery 

of the aid. 

<p> In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell , the groups--<a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty 

International</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human Rights Watch</a> 

(HRW), and the <a href="http://www.wola.org/" target="_new">Washington Office 

on Latin America</a> (WOLA)--said that the Colombian military had failed to suspend 

officers responsible for serious rights abuses or cooperate with civilian authorities 

in prosecuting or punishing them. They also charged that the military had not 

moved seriously to end its support of right-wing paramilitary groups. 

<p> In order to continue supplying military aid to Colombia, Powell must certify 

that all three of these conditions are being met. 

<p> "Our conclusion is stark," the letter said. "Not only has Colombia, once again, 

failed to meet even the minimum standard necessary to satisfy the human rights 

conditions, but its level of compliance has deteriorated markedly. We urge you 

to deny the human rights certification to Colombia and instead insist that it 

make convincing and demonstrable reforms before receiving any additional funds." 

<p> The letter comes amid moves by Colombia's new president, Alvaro Uribe, to 

prepare the ground for an intensified counter-insurgency campaign against left-wing 

rebels who have also escalated the 35-year-old conflict over the past month. 

<p> In mid-August, Uribe, who received a strong popular mandate in last May's 

elections, declared a "state of domestic commotion" that confers on the government 

greater powers to make arrests without a warrant, exert control over electronic 

media, and levy new taxes to cover the costs of a major military build-up, including 

plans to expand the intelligence network and an initiative to arm thousands of 

rural peasants. 

<p> In addition, the government has backed an effort by Attorney General Luis 

Camilo to dismiss pending investigations and prosecutions of military officers 

accused of serious human rights abuses. 

<p> Uribe has also disclosed that Colombia, in ratifying the Rome Protocol for 

the creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC) early last month, included 

a previously secret declaration denying the ICC jurisdiction over war crimes committed 

in Colombia for a period of seven years. The declaration was devised by outgoing 

President Andres Pastrana with Uribe's apparent backing. 

<p> In a separate statement Thursday, HRW denounced the declaration, saying that 

it was a "prelude to impunity." 

<p> "At the moment," said HRW Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco, "peace has 

never seemed further off, and this dispensation will only encourage more horrific 

abuses against civilians to occur. President Uribe can reverse the declaration 

at any time, and he should do so now." 

<p> Wednesday's letter was sent to Powell after briefings by state department 

officials last week to human rights groups, including the three signers. The briefings, 

which are intended to inform department officials about the groups' concerns before 

it makes a decision about certification, are mandated under the same law that 

includes the aid conditions. 

<p> But the groups came away from the latest briefings convinced that the administration 

had already made up its mind to certify the three conditions as having been met. 

"It was clear to us that what we said was irrelevant," said HRW's Colombia specialist, 

Robin Kirk, who predicted the certifications would likely be announced within 

the coming week. 

<p> Washington is providing Colombia with almost &#36;400 million in military 

aid this fiscal year, of which only about &#36;104 million was subject to the 

three conditions. In a controversial decision that was delayed three months, the 

state department certified that the conditions were met last May in order to disburse 

about &#36;63 million of the total. The pending certification will provide the 

armed forces with another &#36;41.6 million, according to the state department.
