</table></font>The comments came amid allegations by rights groups and victims that the Indian government was attempting to dilute the case against former company chairman Warren Anderson.</p>

<p>"The government of India is committed to seeking the extradition of Anderson," foreign ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said.</p>

<p>"The concerned agencies have been asked to strengthen the evidentiary details that link him to the Bhopal gas case so that the extradition request is successful," Rao said.</p>

<p>But she conceded that the case against Anderson had dragged for an inordinately long period.</p>

<p>A court in the central Indian city of Bhopal last month ruled that Anderson should face culpable homicide charges over the gas disaster.</p>

<p>The August 28 ruling represented a major victory for the disaster victims, who are worried that Anderson will escape justice.</p>

<p>The former Union Carbide chairman is regarded as an absconder in India after failing to appear in court and returning to the United States, where he has no listed address.</p>

<p>A day after the court's verdict international environmental group <a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines02/0830-05.htm">Greenpeace 

claimed</a> it had tracked down Anderson in the upscale Hamptons resort area in 

Long Island, New York.</p>

<p>If Anderson is extradited from the United States and convicted in India, he could face a prison term of up to 20 years.</p>

<p>Around 3,000 people died in the gas leak at the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal on December 3, 1984 and more than half a million people were seriously injured.</p>

<p>At least another 10,000 deaths have been linked to the disaster, according 

to victims' groups.</p>
