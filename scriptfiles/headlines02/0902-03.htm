<p>JOHANNESBURG - World leaders gathered at the Earth Summit in Johannesburg and 

said the planet's future was darkened by poverty and a deteriorating environment, 

and urged global action to root out these evils.</p>

<p>"Our house is burning down and we're blind to it," French President Jacques Chirac said Monday. </p>

<p>"Nature, mutilated and over-exploited, can no longer regenerate, and we refuse to admit it... the Earth and mankind are in danger, and we are all responsible."</p>

Delegates wander aound some of the 6,000 statues made by deprived South African 

communities near the Sandton Convention Center which is hosting the World Summit 

on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, Sunday Sept. 1, 2002. The display 

put on by Friends of the Earth has the small statues representing the voices of 

the people struggling to defend their lives, communities and environment and the 

six meter robot statue symbolizes the power of major corporations. The poster 

behind reads &quot;Don't let big business rule.&quot;(AP Photos/Saurabh Das) <br>

</table></font>Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany declared that climate change, inflicted by man's reckless burning of fossil fuels, had already begun, wreaking floods and drought in three continents.</p>

<p>"There has been a dramatic increase in extreme weather conditions and it shows 

one thing very clearly -- that climate change is no longer a skeptical forecast 

only, it is a reality wherever we are."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair highlighted famine, war, poverty and disease in Africa, saying this claimed the life of one child every three seconds.</p>

<p>"If Africa is a scar on the conscience of the world, we have a duty to heal it," he said.</p>

<p>Facing this crisis, Western leaders vowed emotionally they would commit money and skills to help eradicate want and protect the environment.</p>

<p>US President George W. Bush was absent from the meeting, which gathered around 100 heads of state and government, a snub which has infuriated environmentalists at the mammoth 10-day forum, which has drawn more than 40,000 delegates to official and fringe events.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, exhausted negotiators were down to one last sticking point in a 71-page action plan, but environmentalists complained that compromises had blunted its teeth.</p>

<p>The last hurdle is access to electricity for the two billion people living in dire poverty and increasing power from solar panels, windmills and ocean waves to reduce dependence on polluting and finite fossil fuels such as coal, gas and petroleum.</p>

<p>The Plan of Implementation is due to be issued as the summit ends on Wednesday, along with a political declaration which in its draft form supports multilateralism, corruption-free government and a commitment to fight terrorism.</p>

<p>Schroeder promised a billion euros (dollars) to help developing countries gain access to clean, efficient energy and announced he would host a conference on renewable energy next year.</p>

<p>Blair vowed to boost his country's development aid and called on rich countries to open up their protected agricultural markets to goods from poor nations.</p>

<p>"Britain will raise by 2006 its commitment to development aid for Africa to one billion pounds (1.54 billion dollars, euros) a year and its overall levels of assistance to all countries by 50 percent," Blair said. The increase had been previously announced.</p>

<p>British officials said they were unable to give details about Blair's promise for a 50 percent increase in overall aid, and said it was not included in his prepared speech.</p>

<p>Chirac revived a controversial call for a global tax to finance development, 

saying it would be a "solidarity levy on the wealth created by globalization".</p>

<p>The European Union pledged it would reform the lavish system of agricultural subsidies and tariff barriers blamed for destroying the livelihood of rural farmers around the developing world.</p>

<p>"We recognize the importance of agriculture for developing countries and we 

agree that tariff reduction is not enough," said European Commission President 

Romano Prodi.</p>
