KIEV   - 

Ukraine and Belarus appealed to the world

on Friday not to forget Chernobyl and its victims who still

need help 16 years after the world's worst nuclear disaster

spewed clouds of radioactivity across much of Europe.

<p>

</table></font>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister Anatoly

Kinakh and other officials laid flowers at a symbolic burial

mound in the capital Kiev, paying tribute to those who died

after Chernobyl's reactor four exploded on April 26, 1986.

<p>

Carrying flowers, officials lit candles for the dead at a

church built to commemorate the accident. Hours earlier

hundreds of Ukrainians gathered there with their heads bowed as

bells tolled just after one in the morning--the time of the

blast.

<p>

"The Chernobyl catastrophe should never be wiped from human

memory," the government said in a state newspaper. It urged

human and financial support for the people involved in the

clean-up--so-called liquidators--and other victims. "We call

upon voluntary organizations, funds, every concerned citizen to

show understanding and help heal the painful problems of the

liquidators...those who were evacuated from their birthplaces,

invalids and families who lost breadwinners as a result of the

accident at Chernobyl."

<p>

The Chernobyl explosion, which killed just over 30

firefighters at the time, has been blamed for thousands of

deaths due to radiation-linked illness and for a huge increase

in thyroid cancer.

<p>

Dozens of women laid red carnations at the burial mound,

silent and thoughtful as yet another year passes with Ukraine,

neighboring Belarus and Russia unable to overcome the

consequences of the accident.

<p>

CONTAMINATED FOOD

<p>

In Belarus, thousands gathered near the center of the

capital Minsk to call for government and international help to

heal the scars of the fall-out, demanding an end to food output

from miles of land contaminated with radioactive debris.

<p>

Struck by poverty, many in Ukraine and Belarus pick

mushrooms and berries with high levels of radioactivity.

<p>

Health specialists have advised that genetic mutations and

contaminated food could lead to a new generation of Chernobyl

victims and prolong the tragedy for years to come.

<p>

One academic, Dmitry Hrodzinsky, also said he believed the

concrete tomb now encasing the ruined reactor was unsafe,

allowing radioactive dust to seep into the environment--a

statement denied by officials.

<p>

Officials at the plant agree the reactor needs another

covering, dubbed a second shelter, but say radiation levels are

decreasing and the ruined reactor poses little threat.

<p>

"Today the situation at the station is stable," said

Volodymyr Kholoshcha, head of the Chernobyl zone's

administration.

<p>

Ukraine's government said it would strive to make the

reactor safe, improve the lives of the accident's victims and

revive contaminated lands, but that it needed funds promised by

the West when Chernobyl was shut down in 2000.

<p>

"We hope that the 16th anniversary of this dreadful

event...will attract the attention of the world community to

the global problem of...protecting the world from future

(industrial and ecological) disasters," the government said.

<p>

"We believe our appeal will reach the hearts of those who

understand others' sorrow."
