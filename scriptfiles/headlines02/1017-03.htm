<p> BEIRUT -- French President Jacques Chirac made his strongest statement yet 

against a military strike on Iraq, saying yesterday that &#34;war is the worst 

solution&#34; and that &#34;everything must be done to avoid it.&#34;</P>

<P>Mr. Chirac spoke in Alexandria, Egypt, as he made his way to a summit of francophone 

countries in Beirut.</P>

<P>The francophone summit is usually a mainly cultural event, but it has taken 

on a political coloration this year because of its Middle Eastern venue and the 

presence of Mr. Chirac.</P>

<P>France has been resisting U.S. efforts to have the United Nations Security 

Council permit an attack on Iraq if Baghdad does not comply fully with UN weapons 

inspections.</P>

<P>&#34;Our American friends would like this same resolution to authorize the 

international community, if one believes the Iraqi authorities are not doing what 

is necessary, to intervene militarily,&#34; Mr. Chirac said after a meeting with 

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</P>

<P>&#34;I have always thought that war is the worst solution. Everything must 

be done to avoid it,&#34; he added.</P>

<P>France is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and can therefore exercise 

a veto on any proposed resolution, and U.S. officials have been growing increasingly 

frustrated with French unwillingness to authorize force. Yesterday, Mr. Chirac 

hinted strongly that France would veto any resolution that seemed likely to lead 

to war.</P>

<P>&#34;The region does not need another war if we can avoid it,&#34; he said.</P>

<P>Although cultural issues still dominate the official agenda of the francophone 

summit, bilateral discussions among the more than 50 leaders attending the summit 

will be dominated by the situation in the Middle East.</P>

<P>Earlier this week, Mr. Chirac also disputed the American position that there 

is a link between the al-Qaeda terrorist network and the Iraqi regime.</P>

<P>In an interview with a Beirut newspaper in advance of the summit, the French 

leader said &#34;no proof had been found&#34; of a connection.</P>

<P>Officials from Canada, the Francophonie's second major sponsor, said Prime 

Minister Jean Chr&#233;tien agrees with that view.</P>

<P>In the past, Mr. Chr&#233;tien's position on a military strike against Iraq 

has been more ambivalent than that of Mr. Chirac. But at this week's summit, he 

may be inclined to distance himself from the United States. Canada's ambassador 

to Lebanon, Michel Duval, told the English-language Daily Star newspaper that 

Ottawa &#34;believes force can achieve very little,&#34; and that it does not 

regard a military strike as a &#34;solution to the current crisis.&#34;</P>

<P>The push to disarm Iraq, using military force if necessary, has been described 

by some of its critics as a coalition of English-speaking countries, since the 

most enthusiastic supporters of the action have been the United States, Britain 

and Australia.</P>

<P>The Francophonie is probably too diverse a group to develop a common policy 

on the crisis. The organization includes members from Europe, the Middle East, 

Asia and North and South America, including more than 50 former colonies.</P>

<P>In Lebanon, which bid to host the summit three years ago in order to showcase 

the country's emergence from decades of civil war and foreign occupation, a number 

of political factions have welcomed it as a counterweight to U.S. regional policy.</P>

<P>That even includes the militant Islamist group Hezbollah, which Washington 

has branded a terrorist organization.</P>
