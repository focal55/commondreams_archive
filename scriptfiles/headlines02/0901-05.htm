<p> SEOUL - North Korea lashed out at the United States on Sunday over what it 

called Washington's hypocritical stance on weapons and said talks could only take 

place if the Bush administration dropped its hostility.

<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton, in a trip to  Seoul last week, branded the North as the world's foremost  missile peddler, accusing Pyongyang of selling ballistic  missile-related equipment, components, materials and technical  expertise.<p>His comments came as North and South Korea were holding  high-level talks on resuming road and rail links severed for  half a century and raised fears the North would walk out in  protest.<p>"Known as a standard-bearer among the notorious hard-line  hawks of the Bush Administration, Bolton never opens his mouth  without making anti-DPRK remarks, bereft of reason," a  spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the  official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).<p>DPRK is an acronym of Democratic People's Republic of  Korea, the state's official name.<p>The North also accused the United States of double  standards over weapons development.<p>"U.S. hawks are charging the DPRK with deployment and  proliferation of missiles," the official agency said.<p>"The brigandish charge means that they are free to develop,  produce, deploy and proliferate any type of mass destruction  weapons but other sovereign states' legitimate policy of  increasing their self-defense capacity poses a threat to them."<p>"If there is any security issues over which the U.S. should  worry, it is entirely attributable to the Bush Administration's  hostile policy toward the DPRK," the agency said.<p>MISSILE PROGRAM "MISUNDERSTOOD"<p>KCNA said the United States had misunderstood the North's  missile program, saying it was for a peaceful purpose.<p>Bolton, who advises Secretary of State Colin Powell on arms  control and international security, has said President Bush's  description of North Korea as part of an "axis of evil" with  Iraq and Iran was factually correct.<p>He said the communist state needed drastic reforms to  survive, but underscored Washington's readiness to start its  own dialogue with North Korea.<p>But North Korea said it wanted the United States to make  concessions on its hard-line policy before talks could begin.<p>"The DPRK clarified more than once that if the U.S. has a  will to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK it will have  dialogue with the U.S. to clear the U.S. of its worries over  its security."<p>Pyongyang also criticized the recent U.S. imposition of  sanctions against some North Korean companies accused of  transferring and selling missile technology, saying it was  another declaration of confrontation with North Korea.<p>Separately, North Korea said U.S. forces has committed more  than 200 cases of what it called aerial espionage against it in  August, quoting a military source.<p>Among them nearly 50 espionage flights were made by  strategic reconnaissance, command and patrol planes, KCNA  reported.<p>North and South Korea reached an agreement on Friday to  reconnect a railway and road through the world's last Cold War  frontier this year and to aim for military talks next month on  doing the job safely.

<p>In the past week, Pyongyang held high-level meetings with Russia and Japan 

in a flurry of diplomatic moves after it adopted tentative economic reforms.</p>
