<p>Consumer demand in Western industrialized countries for sophisticated electronic 

equipment and luxury goods earned at least US&#36;12 billion last year for rebels 

groups, rapacious governments, and warlords in resource-rich developing nations 

around the world, according to a new report released by the <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/" target="_new">Worldwatch 

Institute</a> in Washington, D.C. Thursday. 

<p> The 91-page report, '<a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/pubs/paper/162/orderpage.html" target="_new">The 

Anatomy of Resource Wars</a>,' found that local conflicts over control of diamonds, 

tropical hardwoods, and other minerals like coltan, which is used in the production 

of cell phones and other electronic equipment, have killed or uprooted more than 

20 million people, most of them in Africa, over the past decade. 

<p> "From Colombia to Angola to Afghanistan, people are dying every day because 

consumer societies import and use materials irrespective of where they originate," 

according the author, Michael Renner. 

<p> "If you purchase a cell phone, you may very well be paying to keep the war 

going in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where rival armies fight 

for control over deposits of coltan, a commodity that just over a decade ago had 

little commercial value, but is now vital for the one billion plus cell phones 

in use today." 

<p> But the biggest resource looter over the past decade, according to the report, 

was the UNITA rebel group in Angola which finally collapsed after its founder 

and long-time leader, Jonas Savimbi was killed in combat earlier this year. Between 

1992 and 2001, according to the report, the insurgency sold an estimated &#36;4-4.2 

billion in diamonds mined by its forces in the northeastern part of the country. 

<p> Diamonds were also a leading source of money and arms for rebels in Sierra 

Leone who gained international notoriety during the latter part of the 1990s by 

hacking off the limbs of unarmed civilians to terrorize surrounding populations. 

<p> Such groups have benefited from economic globalization, according to Renner. 

"The enormous expansion in global trade, coupled with lax or corrupt customs officials, 

has made access to key markets relatively easy for warring groups," he said. 

<p> "Companies and rich nations that benefit from cheap raw materials have long 

turned a blind eye to the destruction at their source, and most consumers don't 

know that a number of common purchases bear the invisible imprint of violence," 

he added. 

<p> Although rebel and government armies battle for control of the resources, 

most of the violence in such conflicts are directed against civilians. 

<p> In addition to the violence used to maintain control of local populations, 

fighting groups often forcibly recruit boys into their ranks and girls as sex 

slaves for older commanders. The same armies also draft civilians, including children, 

to extract resources without compensation. 

<p> Resource wars also tend to take place in or near areas that are of significant 

environmental value, according to the report, which cited conflicts over mineral 

and timber resources in ecologically highly sensitive forests in the DRC, Indonesia, 

Papua New Guinea, and Colombia as major examples. In many cases, indigenous populations 

are also threatened. 

<p> While diamonds fed conflicts in Angola and Sierra Leone, control over timber 

has played a major role in conflicts in Liberia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Myanmar 

(formerly Burma), while drugs have fueled wars in Afghanistan and Colombia. Ownership 

disputes over oil fields and pipelines have also contributed to conflicts in Colombia 

and Sudan, according to the report. 

<p> Recent media attention about resource-driven conflicts has spurred growing 

calls for global rules to ban goods acquired in this way from being traded on 

global markets. Among the most important efforts is a certification system that 

would track individual diamonds from their source through international commercial 

channels in order to assure the eventual buyer that they are not purchasing "blood 

diamonds." 

<p> In addition to endorsing a strong certification system, Worldwatch is calling 

for the adoption of corporate codes of conduct in resource extraction industries; 

support for activist campaigns that "name and shame" companies that profit from 

illicit commerce; and new regulations that would require companies to become more 

transparent in their dealings in resource-rich countries. 

<p> Renner also urges stronger efforts to reduce the availability of small arms, 

a major feature of resource conflicts, by adopting stricter export regimes, regulating 

arms brokers, and better marking and tracing of weapons. 

<p> More generally, the report calls for development aid to promote greater diversification 

of resource-rich developing economies in order to reduce their dependence on the 

resources which have spurred so much conflict. </p>
