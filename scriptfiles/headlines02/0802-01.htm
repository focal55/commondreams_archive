<p>King Abdullah of Jordan warned President George Bush yesterday that even Tony 

Blair, the leader of the country considered most likely to join a US military 

attack against Saddam Hussein, has "tremendous concerns" about the consequences 

of any such campaign to unseat the Iraqi leader.</p>

<p>At a meeting with the US president in Washington, which followed talks in Europe 

with Mr Blair and President Jacques Chirac of France, King Abdullah urged Mr Bush 

to focus first on settling the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and achieving his 

proclaimed goal of a peace deal within three years. "We have a light at the end 

of the tunnel, but we have no tunnel," he said.</p>

<p>The King's revelation that Mr Blair shares the growing international unease 

about Washington's headlong rush to war with Iraq, provides a rare glimpse into 

his private concerns, in contrast to the supportive public statements for the 

US position.</p>

<p>In a remarkably outspoken interview with The Washington Post, the King pulled 

no punches about the alarm felt abroad at the prospect of an attack. "In all the 

years I've been in the international community, everyone is saying this is a bad 

idea.If it seems America wants to hit Baghdad, that is not what the Jordanians 

think, or the British, the French, the Russians, the Chinese or anyone else," 

he said.</p>

<p>Mr Blair "has tremendous concerns about how this would unravel," he added. 

King Abdullah's remarks are the first public signal that the Prime Minister is, 

behind the scenes, counselling caution on plans for an assault on Iraq.</p>

<p>They underline The Independent's report earlier this week that Downing Street 

has received advice from the Government's own lawyers that an invasion would be 

illegal without a fresh UN mandate.</p>

<p>Mr Blair's spokeswoman refused to deny the accuracy of King Abdullah's account 

of his meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday. "They had a constructive and 

friendly meeting. The Prime Minister believes that weapons of mass destruction 

is an issue which has to be addressed. But no decisions have been taken," she 

said.</p>

<p>King Abdullah was dismissive of assertions by senior US officials that a swift 

victory would lead to the emergence of a democratic regime in Baghdad and improve 

the climate for a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, that might be so. But "life being as it is, and so uncertain, 

very few people are convinced that" that would happen so easily, he said. Our 

concern is exactly the opposite, that a miscalculation in Iraq would throw the 

whole region into turmoil, he added.</p>

<p>The King's warnings come amid a furious debate in Washington, pitting a cautious 

military and diplomatic establishment against top civilian officials, led by Vice-President 

Dick Cheney and the Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who favour a bold surprise 

strike to get rid of Saddam once and for all.</p>

<p>Mr Bush himself, who will be given a full briefing soon by Mr Rumsfeld on preparations 

on Iraq, shows no signs of being swayed; Washington's policy was regime change, 

he told reporters in the Oval Office, flanked by the King. "We are looking at 

all the options, all the tools, and I haven't changed my mind." But in the country 

the debate is finally being joined. For a second consecutive day, the Senate Foreign 

Relations Committee held hearings &#150; billed as a "national dialogue" by its 

chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware &#150; on Iraq, this time concentrating on the 

prime worry of King Abdullah: what would happen once President Saddam had been 

toppled.</p>

<p>Economic concerns are also surfacing, amid warnings that the US is unlikely 

to receive any financial help, in contrast to the 1991 Gulf war </p>
