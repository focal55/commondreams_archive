<p>CAIRO, Egypt - Shahir Zetain goes out of his way to seek out American visitors 

in this swarming Arab capital, often helping them cross the 10 lanes of unceasing 

traffic at Tahrir Square, near the Egyptian Museum where he works.

</table>But he doesn't pass up opportunities to give them a piece of his mind, either. 

Zetain says he feels a deep, personal rage over the United States' war against 

terror and its looming showdown with Iraq.</p>

<p> "Can you imagine what it's like," he says, sipping tea at a back-alley cafe, 

"to every day have to defend your culture and your religion? This is not right. 

... The world knows this."</p>

<p> Even as the American government issues new warnings about al-Qaida terrorism 

and prepares for a seemingly inevitable war against Iraq, Arabs in Egypt and the 

wider Middle East grow ever more livid at U.S. policies they perceive as arrogant, 

duplicitous and religiously biased.</p>

<p> "Ever since the end of World War II, Egyptians have had an image of the United 

States as fair players, as not longing for conquest," says Wahid Kazziha, a political 

science professor in Cairo for the last 30 years. "But this has changed rather 

quickly. We're now seeing a culture of aggressiveness that is taking a religious 

turn, with Islam as the target."</p>

<p> Unhappiness with U.S. foreign policy in this city of 15 million, the historic 

intellectual capital of the Arab world, is hardly a new expression. From the 1950s, 

when Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser toyed with an alliance with the Soviet 

Union, to the present day, when people here overwhelming excoriate the United 

States for its pro-Israel stance, Egyptians have had serious problems with American 

Middle East policy.</p>

<p> But the pervasiveness and depth of anti-U.S. feeling today are reaching new 

dimensions, observers say, holding the prospect for ominous consequences.</p>

<p> For the moment, Bush administration officials don't believe adverse reaction 

by the so-called "Arab street" will have much effect, if any, on their campaign 

against Iraq's Saddam Hussein. But, from Secretary of State Colin Powell on down, 

they do acknowledge that growing bitterness over U.S. actions, in Egypt and the 

wider region, has worrisome long-term implications.</p>

<p> Unless the United States can find a way to counter it, Daniel Brumberg of 

Georgetown University told Congress earlier this fall, "the U.S. may win the battle 

but lose the war."</p>

<p> A recent visit to Cairo, during the heart of the religious holiday of Ramadan, 

showed a remarkably consistent view by Egyptians of U.S. policy. Conversations 

with government officials, scholars and people on the street suggest that, while 

they still take a natural shine to Americans, Egyptians believe U.S. policy has 

taken a turn since Sept. 11, 2001, targeting Arabs because they're Arab and Muslims 

because they're Muslim.</p>

<p> Abdel Nassef, a student at Cairo University, greeted an American visitor warmly 

as he walked out the university's gates, just a few blocks from the Nile River. 

But his mood changed when asked about the war on terrorism.</p>

<p> "Before 9/11, Egyptians considered the United States a friend, no question," 

says Nassef. "But after 9-11 it's different. Now we see the American government 

considers all Arabs terrorists."</p>

<p> Indeed, it appears President Bush is having little success in arguing that 

his war aims are not directed at Muslims or Arabs. His Ramadan observances at 

the White House and visits to Washington-area mosques are seen here as no more 

than ploys. His true colors, many say, showed through five days after the terrorist 

attacks, when he referred to the U.S. response as a "crusade," a word with powerful 

anti-Muslim connotations.</p>

<p> Zetain, who works in the Egyptian Museum's mummy restoration room and constantly 

engages American visitors on foreign policy issues, says Bush's Nov. 5 election 

successes are bound to accelerate U.S. aggressiveness in the Middle East.</p>

<p> After pausing to listen to an imam's call to prayer from a nearby mosque, 

Zetain launches into a lengthy discourse on the political benefits to Bush of 

taking on Arabs and Muslims.</p>

<p> "The Bush people figure going to war against Arabs is good politics," he says.</p>

<p> Foreign policy experts in the United States are divided about what the United 

States can or should do about this avalanche of anti-American feeling.</p>

<p> Many contend the government needs to accelerate recent efforts to tell the 

American story in new and more varied ways. Others, though, say popular opinion 

in the Middle East is a rigged game, because both government regimes and radical 

groups benefit by establishing the United States as world villain.</p>

<p> "It is hardly surprising that the masses, shut off from accurate data and 

constantly fed antagonistic views, have grown hostile to the United States," Barry 

Rubin of the Council on Foreign Relations writes in the new issue of Foreign Affairs 

magazine.</p>

<p> Indeed, it's not hard to find Egyptians espousing what sound to an American 

mind like anti-Semitic conspiracy theories or flat-out falsehoods. Quite often, 

they're voiced by the country's best-educated.</p>

<p> Sahar el Din, diplomatic editor for Al Wafd, one of the city's opposition-party 

newspapers, agreed to substitute her weekly English lesson for an interview on 

a recent Saturday night. Sitting on the balcony of her instructor's apartment, 

with a perfect view of the shimmering Nile, she challenged point after point of 

what U.S. officials would call indisputable facts.</p>

<p> "Where is the evidence that al-Qaida was behind 9/11?" she asks, shaking her 

head when it was suggested that not even Osama bin Laden seemed to dispute the 

notion.</p>

<p> Others see the U.S. campaigns against terror and Saddam as new pieces of an 

old worldwide Jewish conspiracy to control Arab lands - a view given new support 

this month through airing on state television of a controversial new documentary.</p>

<p> But Americans would be making a huge mistake, Egyptians say, to interpret 

their rage as a product of misinformation. Egyptian citizens are long practiced 

at questioning their information sources, they say, and media manipulation has 

no effect on their essential conclusion that American policy has taken an anti-Arab, 

anti-Islam turn.</p>

<p> "I've traveled in the United States," says American University of Cairo student 

Basel Safi. "I've seen how little foreign news is in American papers. I don't 

know how much Americans really know."</p>

<p> Almost as much as expressing anger, many Egyptians here say they are puzzled 

by U.S. policy.</p>

<p> For example, some wonder why the United States hasn't taken more notice of 

Egypt's efforts, long before Sept. 11, 2001, to combat terrorism here and to protect 

its lucrative tourism business.</p>

<p> Dimitri Farage, a professional tour guide, had all the work he could handle 

in the early 1990s on cruise ships that plied the Nile between Cairo and the archeological 

sites to the south. But in October 1997, gunmen belonging to a fundamentalist 

Islamic, antigovernment group ambushed and killed 58 tourists in Luxor, and Egypt's 

tourism business virtually vanished overnight.</p>

<p> In response, the government of Hosni Mubarak worked swiftly to root out the 

perpetrators. And, Farage notes, the Egyptian people were completely on board, 

for more than economic reasons.</p>

<p> "When we see these killings, the people feel deceived," says Farage, who says 

that Egyptians also have rejected the native son who many say is the real driving 

force behind al-Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's top adviser.</p>

<p> By early this decade, Egypt's tourism industry had begun to recover, only 

to take another dive when terrorist hijackers attacked the United States. Once 

again Farage is scrambling for work.</p>

<p> A recent weekend excursion to the Great Pyramid in Giza, just outside Cairo, 

showed the depth of tourism's plunge. On a sparkling day with perfect temperatures, 

hawkers offering their camels for hire as photo props nearly equaled the handful 

of tourists gathered before the last of the world's Seven Wonders.</p>

<p> "People are afraid, I guess," says Farage.</p>

<p> The issue of American fear comes up often here, sometimes derisively, sometimes 

as a curiosity. Even some who acknowledge the seriousness of the Sept. 11 attack 

wonder why it has so rattled and provoked the world's unequalled superpower.</p>

<p> "While the U.S. could land a man on the moon, it is beset by unspeakable fear," 

writes Anis Mansour in the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram. He accuses Bush of feeding 

the fear, viewing the world as "full of ghosts, phantoms and specters."</p>

<p> At a break between classes at the American University, students virtually 

pleaded with a reporter to write about how the United States' standing as the 

lone superpower has changed the way American foreign policy is now viewed in the 

Arab world.</p>

<p> "Don't you understand, we have no power," says Ahmed Salama, a senior engineering 

student. "We can't compete. The United States has all the power."</p>

<p> Except for the occasional female student wearing a scarf or other head covering, 

the scene in the school's courtyard is one that might be transplanted anywhere 

in the United States. Reebok T-shirts are in vogue; one student wears a Boston 

Celtics warm-up jacket. A month earlier, though, this was the site of an anti-American 

protest, carefully monitored by police to make sure it stayed within the school's 

walls.</p>

<p> Faculty and students signed a statement that said a U.S.-led war against Iraq 

would "set a precedent for a new interventionist policy backed by the philosophy 

of might is right. ... U.S. policy in the Middle East has nothing to do with the 

defense of political, social or human rights. ... It has everything to do with 

establishing regional hegemony."</p>

<p> Three students at the school, Basel Safi, Omar Abdel Bary and Muhammed Khedr, 

agreed that Iraq would be only a first target for the U.S. military. In a fast-paced 

debate before heading for their next class, the three speculated who might be 

the United States' next target.</p>

<p> "I'm guessing Syria, then who knows?"</p>

<p> "Iran probably."</p>

<p> "Don't forget Yemen."</p>

<p> "Oh, won't that be tough for the U.S."</p>

<p> "Then Egypt."</p>

<p> "No, not Egypt, are you serious?"</p>

<p> "I'm serious. Who's going to stop the U.S.?"</p>

<p> Emad Shahin, a political science professor at the school, says he sees a growing 

frustration among students at what they perceive as power-mongering by American 

officials.</p>

<p> "This is the kind of imbalance of power that drives people crazy," he says. 

"It will accumulate and build up. And eventually you're going to see more terrorism 

come out of it."</p>

<p> The powerful context for all these discussions is the Israeli-Palestinian 

struggle, which inevitably is raised in any conversation here about American Middle 

East policy. Until the United States eases back on its support for Israel, many 

say, it is doomed to a collision course with the Arab world.</p>

<p> Sara Youseff, another American University student, says she and her friends 

have studied U.S. history and believe that the Palestinian pursuit of a homeland 

is the type of cause Americans have almost always supported.</p>

<p> "All of us are convinced that if this were any other part of the world, the 

United States would be on the other side," she says.</p>

<p> Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans are mostly allied with 

Israel in its struggle with the Palestinians. But here, the margin is even more 

one-sided in the opposite direction.</p>

<p> "The Americans have completely lost public opinion and moral standing in the 

Arab world because of what's happened in Palestine," says Abdel Moneim Said, director 

of the Al-Ahram political think tank in Cairo.</p>

<p> Despite all this, Egyptians today still show a great natural affinity for 

Americans, greeting them warmly on the street and showing off their own American 

connections.</p>

<p> Shahin, the political science professor, sees signs this is changing.</p>

<p> "I have an American friend who's lived here a long time," he says. "Suddenly 

he's telling people he's Canadian.</p>

<p> "Perhaps a sign of things to come."</p>

<p> <i>This is the first of two articles on sentiment in the Middle East amid 

a looming showdown over Iraq.</i></p>

<p> &#8226;Egyptians like Americans but dislike what they perceive as the United 

States' increasing aggression.</p>
