<p> Israel, buoyed by US President George W. Bush's new hardline policy on the 

Middle East, seized the West Bank's largest city and geared up for a major push 

on the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Dozens of Israeli tanks and armored personnel carriers poured into Hebron before 

dawn, killing four Palestinian security officers and arresting more than 100 others 

in the latest crackdown on militants.</p>

<p>The move came just hours after Bush delivered his much-anticipated statement 

on the Middle East, clearly urging the ouster of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 

as a pre-condition for the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p>

<p>The speech was widely interpreted here as giving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's 

government a free hand to take military action against the Palestinians after 

a series of suicide bombings and attacks that killed 31 Israelis last week.</p>

<p>International reaction to the address was muted, with most Arab and European 

leaders seeing positive elements but some warning that Arafat's political fate 

was a matter for the Palestinian people to decide.</p>

<p>Several dozen Israeli tanks and armored vehicles moved into Hebron, population 

140,000, and clamped a curfew, while an armored column rumbled into the nearby 

town of Dura, the Palestinian sources said.</p>

<p>Two Palestinian policemen, an intelligence officer and a security officer were 

killed when the Israelis opened fire on the Palestinian leadership's Hebron offices, 

Palestinian security officials said.</p>

<p>At least five other people were wounded.</p>

<p>More than 100 Palestinian policemen were also arrested in the attack on the 

building that houses various Palestinian security services and the Hebron governor's 

office.</p>

<p>Among those taken prisoner in Hebron were Nizam al-Jaabari, the head of the 

city's intelligence services, and Sheikh Jawad al-Natshe, a political leader of 

the radical Palestinian group Hamas, the sources said.</p>

<p>The army also confirmed it had blown up the Hebron house of Hamas militant 

Yasser Sharabati, saying it was used to manufacture "explosive belts ready to 

be used by suicide bombers."</p>

<p>Hebron was the latest target of Israel's week-old Operation "Determined Path", 

which has left the Israelis enforcing curfews in seven of the West Bank's eight 

major towns, with only Jericho spared.</p>

<p>The army, which has vowed to remain in Palestinian areas as long as necessary 

to curb the suicide bombings, encircled Arafat's West Bank headquarters in the 

town of Ramallah for the third time this month.</p>

<p>The Israeli army continued to round up Palestinian suspects across the West 

Bank, including members of Hamas, which has claimed most of the suicide attacks 

on Israeli civilians.</p>

<p>As well as Ramallah and Hebron, Israeli troops have occupied Nablus, Jenin, 

Qalqilya, Tulkarem and Bethlehem, as well as smaller towns and villages.</p>

<p>Sharon was also setting his sights on the Gaza Strip, where a helicopter raid 

Monday killed six people in two cars, including two Hamas militants, and wounded 

10 others.</p>

<p>The Israeli premier said the helicopter missile attack heralded "a massive 

military operation" against Hamas, which had been left largely untouched in the 

21-month-old conflict.</p>
