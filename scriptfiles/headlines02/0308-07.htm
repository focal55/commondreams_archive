Women from more than 60 countries, from Argentina to Uganda, are taking to the streets Friday armed with pots, pans, and brooms to celebrate International Women's Day and to renew demands for gender equality, world peace, and respect for the work of women.

</table></font>The central theme of the 'Global Women's Strike,' Invest in Caring



not Killing, has won support from women involved in struggles against AIDS and poverty in Africa, hunger and war in Afghanistan, and exclusion of indigenous women on every continent.

<p>







Members of Uganda's Kaabong Women's Group are carrying brooms to their



protests "as a symbolic sign to sweep the world clean and solve this 



local and international super crisis." The group said earlier Women's Day protests had brought tangible progress--such as a new, free health clinic and more respect from men.

<p>







In Argentina, El Salvador, and Peru women are taking to the streets 



with pots and pans to symbolize the problems of hunger and unemployment and their demand for equal pay in the workplace. Banging pots and pans, known as a <i>cacerolazo</i>, is a traditional form of protest in Latin America.

<p>







In most countries around the world, women earn one-third less than men, while also managing all household tasks. The value of household labor--such as gathering wood, fetching water, and child care--is estimated at one-third of the world's economic production, but remains unpaid.

<p>







HIV infection rates worldwide are now higher for women than men; 20 to 



50 percent of all women have experienced violence from family members; and half a million women die each year from preventable complications during pregnancy and childbirth, according to data compiled by the Worldwatch Institute.

<p>







Access to reproductive healthcare is a particularly difficult problem faced by women from the Sioux community, said Charon Asteoyer who works as an educator on health issues within Native American communities in the United States.

<p>







"Often times contraceptive choices are made by the Indian Health 



Service and not by the individual woman," she said during an Internet talk Wednesday, noting that the Service often misinforms women about their health status and "coerces" them into sterilization.

<p>







Despite all the progress achieved during the 20th Century, women's



demands for equal rights have not changed markedly since 1910, when a



day to celebrate women's accomplishments and point to continuing



injustices was first proposed. At that time many women were working



12-hour days for low wages in sweatshops and were not allowed to



vote.

<p>







"There has never been so much wealth in the world and there have never 



been so many of us...who have nothing," say the organizers of the Global Strike.
