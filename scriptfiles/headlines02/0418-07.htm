Evidence of atrocities by Israeli troops in Jenin refugee camp grew yesterday 

when a British pathologist said he found "highly suspicious" wounds during the 

first autopsy on a victim.

Palestinians carry the remains of a young boy found in the rubble of the Jenin 

refugee camp in the West Bank, Thursday, April 18, 2002. The U.N. envoy to the 

Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, said after a tour of the camp on Thursday that 

conditions were &quot;horrifying beyond belief.&quot; Roed-Larsen demanded that 

Israel give immediate access to aid organizations and the United Nations so they 

could mount a &quot;major humanitarian operation.&quot; (AP Photo/Jerome Delay)

</font>Derrick Pounder, professor of forensic medicine at Dundee University, who 

is working with Amnesty International, visited the ruined camp and said: "Claims 

that a large number of civilians died and are under the rubble are highly credible.It 

is not believable that only a few people have been killed, given the reports we 

have that a large number of people were inside three and four-storey buildings 

when they were demolished."

<p>The autopsy on the 38-year-old Palestinian revealed that "he was either shot 

in the foot, and then in the back, or shot in the back first &#150; receiving 

a fatal wound &#150; and his corpse was for some reason shot in the foot," he 

said. "Whichever order the shots occurred in, it was highly suspicious".</p>

<p>As the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, left for America yesterday, having 

failed to secure a ceasefire, international fury was growing over events at Jenin. 

The camp, home to 13,500 refugees, was stormed by Israeli forces a fortnight ago 

in what Mr Sharon called a counter-terrorism operation against Palestinian militants. 

The furore has severely damaged Israel's international standing, sending it to 

its lowest point for several decades.</p>

<p>Palestinians who survived the long battle &#150; in which Israeli helicopters 

fired rockets and machine-guns into a densely populated area &#150; have said 

the Israeli army committed many atrocities. Witnesses have described people being 

shot as they surrendered; houses being bulldozed with people inside; the use of 

human shields; the burial of 32 bodies in a trench, and one case of Israeli soldiers 

turning on the household gas supply before tossing a stun grenade into a room 

full of people.</p>

<p>Richard Cook, head of operations for Unrwa &#150; the UN agency for Palestinian 

refugees &#150; visited the camp yesterday. He said: "I was absolutely appalled. 

I anticipated it to a degree but the devastation was much greater than I expected."</p>

<p>The Foreign Office said "disproportionate and excessive" force had been used 

by Israel, and "clearly civilians were not properly protected". </p>
