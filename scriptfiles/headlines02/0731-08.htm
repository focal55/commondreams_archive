<p> Nigerian villagers who have long clashed with oil companies doing business 

in their backyards are trying a creative protest tactic. They've dropped their 

guns, and some have even threatened to drop their clothes.

</table></font></font>Hundreds of unarmed women from local tribes in the oil-rich but desperately 

poor Niger Delta region brought production to a halt recently at pipeline facilities 

owned by ChevronTexaco by merely occupying the sites. Several dozen village women 

are still holed-up today. 

<p> To make their point, the women threatened to disrobe &#0151; a strong local 

shaming symbol &#0151; and managed to strike a deal with ChevronTexaco that will 

bring jobs and funding for schools, hospitals and other services into their struggling 

community. 

<p> In the past, local actions against oil and gas companies have come from armed 

gangs who frequently take to kidnapping and sabotage to demand jobs or money. 

<p> But experts say ChevronTexaco's peaceful negotiations with the local women 

highlights the strengthened bargaining power villagers wield and how multinational 

corporations, under significant international pressure, are increasingly bowing 

to local demands. 

<p> "This shows the kind of pressure on the oil companies to come through with 

ever higher levels of contributions," said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the 

Africa program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The pressure 

has been building for a long, long time." 

<p><b></a><span class="subhead">An Otherwise Violent History </span></b> 

<p> Unlike the peaceful Nigerian women's protest, the relationship between locals 

and oil companies often has been violent and tumultuous.

<p> Shell came under fire after riotous protests related to the death of organizer 

Kan Saro-Wiwa in 1995. The native playwright was executed on trumped-up murder 

charges by the military dictatorship in Nigeria after he organized a protest movement 

aimed at the oil company.

<p> Such troubles are not unique to West Africa. 

<p> Human rights activists have sued ExxonMobil in U.S. federal court, accusing 

the company of hiring Indonesian government security forces who allegedly committed 

atrocities against locals, including murder, torture and kidnapping. The company 

denies the allegations. 

<p> In Colombia, leftist rebels are suspected of blowing up a pipeline a record 

170 times last year. The pipeline fed oil from a field operated by the U.S. oil 

company Occidental. 

<p> Such tension is perhaps inevitable in poor regions where global companies 

come to get rich. Like other "extraction" businesses, such as mining, oil companies 

are often accused of taking natural resources, giving little back in return and 

spoiling the environment. 

<p> The oil business does not employ large numbers of local people once pipeline 

facilities are built. 

<p> "Revenues generated don't adequately benefit the local area," said Arvind 

Ganesan, director of the business program at Human Rights Watch. 

<p><b></a><span class="subhead">Where's the Payoff?</span> </b>

<p> Regions that produce high yields of lucrative natural resources such as oil 

or diamonds tend to suffer from what economists call "Dutch disease," which refers 

to the wasting away of other industries such as manufacturing or farming.

<p> The result is a population with scarce resources and abundant resentment for 

companies operating in their midst. "Where's the payoff? All of this wealth has 

spun through this government with very little coming back to the average citizen," 

Morrison said. 

<p> These days, it's becoming commonplace for major oil companies to try to shine 

their international reputations by making investments and charitable contributions 

in countries where they operate. 

<p> "Basically what you become is a partner with the local community to provide 

things they need to exist and not feel you're an outsider taking over everything 

they have and not giving anything back," said Bud Covert, executive director of 

the Energy Security Council, a Houston-based group comprised of the security directors 

of most American oil and gas companies.

<p> Investing in local communities, of course, also reaps rewards for the companies 

by fostering stability. 

<p> For one, Shell, which suffered major public relations damage from its Nigeria 

fiasco, now reportedly gives away millions a year in local grants. On its Web 

site, Shell describes building classrooms in the Niger Delta, awarding school 

scholarships and immunizing more than 100,000 young children.

<p> ExxonMobil says 85 percent of the royalties and taxes generated from a $3.5 

billion pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon will be used for social programs 

to help local citizens. 

<p><b></a><span class="subhead">Striking a Balance</span> </b>

<p> In the past, money paid to national governments frequently never trickled 

down to the local level. The trick, in countries rife with corruption, is for 

companies to make wise choices about how they invest their money. 

<p> "Oil companies get hit up constantly. They are trying to manage their affairs 

in ways that are defensible and credible by putting money toward real projects 

and not just payoffs," Morrison said.

<p> With no global regulating body, though, some experts question how far corporations 

can and should go to provide certain services such as schools, hospitals and basic 

infrastructure. 

<p> "Why should the lead responsibility for social development function fall upon 

a private enterprise when we know government is ingesting vast flows and they're 

not being returned?" Morrison said.

<p> In some cases, of course, there are few options. "It should be the role of 

government, be it local, regional or national government, but in some countries, 

they are simply not ready," said Stephen Hayes, president of the Corporate Council 

on Africa. "Should businesses be expected to cover all that? There's a growing 

consensus among oil companies about putting resources back into the communities 

&#0133; but there's got to be a balance at some point."

<p> Other experts question the long-term viability of relying on corporations 

for funding major development projects for poor nations. 

<p> "The danger sign is when people start turning to companies to take on social 

services," Ganesan said. "It's unsustainable over time."
