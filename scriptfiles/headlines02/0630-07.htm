<p>THE HAGUE - The world's first permanent war crimes court starts work on Monday 

but faces opposition from Russia, China and the United States, which wants immunity 

for its overseas peacekeeping troops and other U.S. officials.

<p>The Dutch-based International Criminal Court (ICC) will  have authority over genocide, crimes against humanity and war  crimes as of July 1, 2002.<p>Human rights groups have hailed the court's creation as the  biggest milestone for international justice since top Nazis  were tried by an international military tribunal in Nuremberg  after World War Two.<p>But the United States wants to keep its peacekeepers out of  reach of the ICC and has threatened to stop the U.N. mission in  Bosnia if it did not get its way.<p>The 15-nation U.N. Security Council faces a midnight Sunday  (0400 GMT on Monday) deadline to renew the Bosnia mission, set  up in 1995 to train a multi-ethnic police force after Bosnia's  three-year war that gave rise to the term "ethnic cleansing."<p>Washington has threatened to veto the resolution unless its  peacekeepers and U.S. officials are provided with immunity from  the ICC.<p>Critics say Washington is trying to cripple the tribunal  before it starts, saying its campaign is against the court  itself, which has been ratified by 69 countries.<p>The United States says the court would infringe on national  sovereignty and could lead to politically motivated  prosecutions of its officials or soldiers working outside U.S.  borders.<p>COURT STARTS WORK<p>The row will not remove the symbolism of Monday's opening.<p>"I am delighted to see the progress that is being made to  carry out the principles we articulated in Nuremberg so long  ago," Benjamin Ferencz, a Nuremberg prosecutor, said on a visit  to The Hague.<p>Anyone -- from a head of state to an ordinary citizen --  will be liable to ICC prosecution for human rights violations,  including systematic murder, torture, rape and sexual slavery.<p>A handful of staff will start work at the ICC to pave the  way for 18 judges and a chief prosecutor in early 2003.<p>The ICC is not expected to start investigating cases before  the end of next year. Judges and a prosecutor are expected to  be chosen next January by those countries backing the court.<p>The ICC, set up under a 1998 Rome Treaty, will not probe  crimes committed before its inception and will not supersede  national courts, interceding only when those courts are unable  to investigate or prosecute serious crimes.<p>Cases can be referred by states that have ratified the Rome  Treaty, the U.N. Security Council or the tribunal's prosecutor  after approval from three judges.<p>The Security Council also has the power to suspend an ICC  investigation or prosecution if it believes it could obstruct  its efforts to maintain international peace and security.<p>The U.S., Russia and China are three of the five permanent  members of the 15-seat Security Council.<p>WAR CRIMES<p>The impetus to create the ICC came from the 1992-1995  Bosnia war and the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which spawned two  U.N. war crimes tribunals with localized scope.<p>But the idea for a global criminal court originated in the  late 1940s.<p>The U.N. first recognized the need for a world court to  deal with the kinds of atrocities witnessed during the  Holocaust in Nazi Germany when it approved a convention to  prevent and punish genocide in 1948.

<p>The Cold War stymied progress for decades but in 1998 the U.N.-backed conference 

in Rome paved the way for the ICC. The Rome treaty won its crucial 60th ratification 

in April.</span>
