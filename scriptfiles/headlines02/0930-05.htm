<p> JERUSALEM  - Israeli leaders faced a barrage of  criticism on Monday after ending a siege of Yasser Arafat under  White House pressure to avoid upsetting U.S. plans for possible  war on Iraq.<p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon pulled Israeli tanks out of the  Palestinian president's battered West Bank compound on Sunday,  ending a 10-day-old standoff that began after suicide bombings  killed seven Israelis.<p>"When we made the (siege) decision two weeks ago we did not  anticipate to what extent America had already started its  countdown to an attack on Iraq, that it would get into a  confrontation with the U.N. and Europe and could not suffer  another confrontation," Israeli Housing Minister Natan  Sharansky told Israel Radio.</span>

<P>While Israel focused on its relations with its main ally  and possible U.S. curbs on its military activities against the  Palestinians in the runup to a possible conflict in Iraq, daily  violence raged on in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<p>Israeli soldiers opened fire at stone-throwing youngsters  in the West Bank city of Nablus, killing a 10-year-old boy and  wounding 18 children, Palestinian witnesses and medical  officials said. The army had no immediate comment.<p>A report issued on Monday by Amnesty International said  Israel's military and Palestinian militant groups had all shown  "utter disregard for the lives of children and other civilians"  in two years of bloodshed.<p>The London-based human rights group said more than 250  Palestinian children had been killed during the Palestinian  uprising for statehood. More than 70 Israeli children have  died, most of them killed by Palestinian suicide bombers, it  said.<p>EMBARRASSMENT FOR SHARON<p>In a show of defiance on Sunday, Arafat -- blowing kisses  and making a V-for-Victory sign -- emerged from his sandbagged  office complex in the wake of clouds of dust from retreating  Israeli tanks.<p>The pullback from Arafat's "Muqata" headquarters was an  embarrassing climbdown for Sharon following a message from  President Bush demanding a speedy end to the blockade.<p>Bush's rare rebuke appeared to signal a new dynamic in  Sharon's close relationship with the president and in the prime  minister's policy toward the Palestinians, who have accused the  White House of turning a blind eye to Israeli army clampdowns.<p>Before launching any future moves against Arafat or a  possible Gaza offensive against militants, Sharon would have to  weigh the almost certain anger such actions would trigger in  Washington as it prepared for action against Iraq.<p>Israeli newspaper commentators voiced near-unanimous  criticism of Sharon's handling of a siege that drew  international condemnation. The daily Maariv called it a  "colossal failure."<p>"The lesson for the future: The key to every Middle East  deal is in the hands of Bush, him and only him," said Israel's  Yedioth Ahronoth daily.<p>"Muqata pullout hands Arafat a rare victory," read a  front-page headline in the left-wing Ha'aretz newspaper.<p>Sharon was in Moscow, far from the fray at home, for talks  with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Middle East and  the possibility of U.S. military action against Iraq.<p>In a boost for Sharon, Putin said at the start of their  meeting: "We welcome your decision to lift the siege of Yasser  Arafat's headquarters."<p>Putin added: "I believe this decision was difficult to  take."<p>Russia had criticized the siege, and its culmination  removed a potential obstacle to developing relations with  Israel during Sharon's two-day visit.<p>PALESTINIANS SAY WANTED MEN ESCAPED<p>Sharon had vowed to lift the siege -- his latest attempt to  sideline a leader Washington says should be replaced by  Palestinians "not compromised by terror" -- only when Arafat  turned over 50 suspected militants holed up with him.<p>Palestinian officials said many of the wanted men in the  compound had slipped away after Israeli forces left. They said  it was decided each would fend for himself once the siege  ended.<p>An Israeli security source said: "We have no indications  the wanted men have bolted. Reports reaching us say the most  prominent ones are still inside."<p>In the southern Gazan town of Rafah, a Palestinian woman  was seriously wounded by a fragment from an Israeli tank shell,  Palestinian hospital officials said. Israeli military sources  said troops opened fire after coming under mortar bomb attack.

<p>At least 1,573 Palestinians and 601 Israelis have been killed since the Palestinian 

revolt began in September 2000 after peace talks stalled.</span>
