</font>Yet in the past few weeks, these people who have lives and kids and aren't 

prone to protesting every injustice they see on a tacked-up flyer have left 

their comfortable homes to protest the possibility of war with Iraq. Their 

common motivation: They feel that Washington isn't listening.

<P>Some point to these living-room revolutionaries, as well as to Internet 

petition campaigns, "Peace Is Patriotic" billboards in the Bay Area and an 

uptick in bumper sticker sales, as the tip of an iceberg of anti-war protest 

floating toward the country's midsection.

<P>But aside from demonstrations in October that drew tens of thousands in San 

Francisco and Washington, D.C., others dismiss such uprisings as more ice 

cubes than icebergs of activism -- and hardly unexpected in the Bay Area, 

given its left-of-the-dial leanings.

<P>If a movement is growing, these critics say, then why didn't Congress heed 

it instead of supporting a resolution authorizing President Bush to use force 

in Iraq? Among those who backed it were Democratic Reps. Ellen Tauscher of 

Walnut Creek, Tom Lantos of San Mateo and every congressional Democrat with 

presidential ambitions.

<P>"Everybody likes to say that they represent millions, but they usually only 

represent themselves," said Mo Fiorina, a senior fellow at the Hoover 

Institution and political science professor at Stanford University. "Until you 

see Republicans in Congress deserting the president the way that Democrats 

deserted (President Lyndon) Johnson during Vietnam, then this doesn't amount 

to much."

<P>A noontime rally in Oakland last week drew 150 mostly veteran demonstrators 

-- hardly evidence that the revolution had spread to Atherton.

<P>"When someone told me the other day that so-and-so sold 1,000 bumper 

stickers," Fiorina said, "I responded, 'That's nice, but 100 million people 

voted in the last presidential election.' "

<P>Activists say it's impossible to measure the movement at this stage. But 

what gives them hope is that pockets of activism are showing up in unlikely 

places -- and without a draft dipping into the middle class, which is what 

awakened suburban protest during the Vietnam War.

<P>From study circles of high-tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to 

Thursday's first meeting of a coalition in Walnut Creek, anti-war protest is 

smelling more like mall-bought Givenchy than Telegraph Avenue-purchased 

patchouli.

<P>"People are desperately craving community to talk about this, to express 

themselves," said Michael Nagler, emeritus professor of classics and 

literature at UC Berkeley and founder of the school's Peace and Conflict 

Studies Program.

</font>In the Bay Area, that craving is personified by Julie Tovar, the pregnant 

Albany mom who organized a 200-person march in her neighborhood Nov. 3. By 

Amelia Fay-Berquist, the waitress who got arrested at her first demonstration. 

And by Janet Thomas, the book clubber who stood on a main drag in Lafayette 

and waved a sign -- and to her surprise was joined by 100 of her neighbors.

<P>"I just couldn't sleep at night," said Tovar, 35, the mother of a 2- and a 

4-year-old. Aside from a demonstration while a UC Berkeley student a decade 

ago, Tovar hasn't protested since her parents took her on a Cesar Chavez-led 

march in the 1970s, when she was as old as her youngest child. These days, 

she's a full-time mom.

<P>But the Bush administration's actions in the Middle East were upsetting her,

<P>she said, and "I knew in my heart that others felt the same way."

<P>So during the wee hours one night this fall -- "I think it was my hormones,

" Tovar said -- she posted an item on an Internet forum popular with parents.

<P>Amid postings selling Graco strollers and soliciting for nannies, Tovar 

asked "if many other parents are feeling like I am: pretty voiceless regarding 

the current (relentless) move toward war on Iraq."

<P>

Plenty did. Yet many told Tovar that if they did something publicly, they 

didn't want it to be "real Berkeley." Translation: Easy on the rhetoric and 

ask the speakers to confine their comments to a single issue.

<P>Oh, and several asked that the event not be scheduled from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. -- that's nap time for the kiddies.

<P>So she tailored an event for her middle-class neighborhood. There were only 

two speakers and both addressed only anti-war sentiment, not the grievances of 

the Palestinians or Israelis.

</font></font>The 200 participants walked down Solano Avenue, Albany's main street, and 

gathered in Albany Memorial Park for a balloon-festooned gathering that more 

resembled an overgrown birthday party than an anti-war rally.

<P>Which was the point, Tovar said. "People have this image of families, that 

we're only interested in gassing up our SUVs to take the kids to soccer 

practice. People care. I can't tell you how many wrote and said, 'I don't have 

the time to help, but I'll definitely be there.' "

<P><b>A BOOK CLUB TRANSFORMED</b>

<P>Thomas, a 51-year-old Lafayette schoolteacher, was pleasantly surprised by 

a similar reaction she found in her town, which isn't known as a hotbed of 

activism.

<P>"I know it's a stereotype, but we don't have a lot of time for socializing 

with other adults," said Thomas, who has three children. "Most of that is done 

around the soccer field -- and you don't talk about a lot of issues there. You 

talk about your kids."

<P>Yet shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, her book club was transformed by a 

visit from former Orinda resident Ellen Schwartz. With the group overwhelmed 

with anxiety after the attacks, members were rapt with Schwartz's book, 

"Taking Back Our Lives in the Age of Corporate Dominance," which suggests many 

little things people can do to change their neighborhoods.

<P>A subgroup began concentrating on public service. Over the next several 

months, these suburban parents invited sweatshop activists and refugee agency 

leaders to speak to them, and passed the hat to help their causes.

<P>When war rhetoric heated up this fall, the group felt compelled to do 

something more dramatic. On the Monday before Congress voted on the war 

resolution, Thomas and 20 friends stood near Mount Diablo Boulevard, the 

town's main thoroughfare, greeting the rush-hour traffic. Within minutes, the 

group swelled to 100.

<P>"We were mutually frustrated by the way our culture was evolving," said 

Thomas, who hadn't marched in a protest since 1970, when she was a Stanford 

student.

<P>Only a few motorists heckled, and the jeers were as tame as the 

neighborhood. Said one heckler, "I hear there's a sale on Birkenstocks at 

McCaulou's."

</font>Fay-Berquist, the 22-year-old San Rafael resident, also was moved to action 

by the congressional vote.

<P>She's too busy to be an activist, between getting up at 6 a.m. for her 

waitress job, her studies at College of Marin and the salsa class she takes at 

night.

<P>But the war resolution vote made the possibility of an "unnecessary war" 

seem real. She learned of a protest at a federal office building in San 

Francisco.

<P>At 4 p.m. on Oct. 10, she was marching down Market Street. At midnight, she 

was camped out overnight with people who had been total strangers just hours 

before. At 7:30 a.m., she was arrested for blocking the entrance to the 

building. She was released from jail later that afternoon. Civil disobedience 

charges were dropped a month later.

<P>Since then, Fay-Berquist has spent her Fridays volunteering her database-

crafting skills at Global Exchange, an anti-war coalition in San Francisco. 

Her bigger challenge: to recruit friends and family to future protests.

<P>"I'd love to have a friend walk with me, but there haven't been any takers,

" she said. "People think it's awesome what I'm doing, but it's just not for 

them. Yet."</p>
