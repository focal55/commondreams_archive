<p> SEOUL - North Korea said on Tuesday a recent major policy speech by Washington's 

top arms negotiator was "a sheer lie and the height of baseness," but Pyongyang 

was still ready to talk to the United States about security.

<p>In an address in Seoul on August 29, U.S. Undersecretary of  State John Bolton branded North Korea the world's foremost  peddler of ballistic missile technology and said the communist  state needed drastic reforms to survive.<p>Bolton also said President Bush's description of North  Korea as part of an "axis of evil" with Iraq and Iran was  factually correct rather than a mere rhetorical flourish.<p>"Bolton is getting overheated in the smear campaign and the  moves to stifle the DPRK as the worst type of the U.S. hawkish  hard-liner," said the ruling party's newspaper, Rodong Sinmun.<p>The official KCNA news agency published the daily's  commentary. DPRK is the acronym for North Korea's official  name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.<p>KCNA said Bolton had groundlessly charged North Korea with  possessing biological weapons and smuggling missiles.<p>"Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses this  as a sheer lie and the height of baselessness and  shamelessness," the agency said.<p>"SILLY DREAM"<p>Bolton, who advises Secretary of State Colin Powell on arms  control and international security, gave a detailed account in  his speech of what he said was North Korea's active program to  develop weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological and  nuclear arms. Evidence was compelling but had to remain secret.<p>Bolton criticized North Korea's leadership under Kim  Jong-il but underscored Washington's readiness to start talks.<p>Rodong Sinmun said Bolton was misleading the public by  trying to portray the North as a security concern and insisting  Pyongyang allow international nuclear inspections.<p>"This is nothing but a silly dream," the daily said. "His  demeanor only damages his image as a senior diplomat."<p>Intriguingly, amid the bluster and inventive invective, the  newspaper said North Korea had repeatedly said it was ready to  talk to the United States about security "if its administration  is willing to abandon its hostile policy."<p>"Bolton is well advised to behave himself, if he is  interested in the DPRK-U.S. dialogue," it said.<p>Bolton's remarks came at a sensitive time for diplomacy on  the divided Korean peninsula. There is a presidential election  in the South in December and the impoverished North has been  reaching out as it embarks on tentative economic reforms.<p>Washington is warily watching and weighing dialogue with  the North involving China, Russia, Japan and South Korea as it  prepares for its own possible talks. No date has been set yet.<p>Speaking to a symposium of Asian and European journalists,  many skeptical about North Korea's intentions, ruling party  presidential candidate Roh Moo-hyun, said dialogue would help  bring North Korea out into the international community.<p>"North Korea is irrational and dangerous, but we cannot say  once and for all it will always be," Roh said when asked  whether the South's aid prolonged the life of an unsavory  government.<p>"I'm convinced North Korea wants to develop itself and  wants to participate in the international community," he said.<p>(Additional reporting by Paul Eckert)</span>
