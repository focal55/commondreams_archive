A heavy sense of history and a surprising mood of uncertainty hang over France today as 41 million voters decide between a tarnished President and a man vilified by almost every institution in French society. 

<p>

All the signs point to a crushing re-election victory for President Jacques Chirac, but never has a foregone conclusion been awaited with so much nervousness. By common consent, a score above 30 per cent for the veteran far- right leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, will leave France deeply mired in political crisis.

</p>

<p>

Although the final opinion polls suggest that Mr Le Pen, 73, will score only in the low twenties &#173; and the National Front leader himself has reduced his benchmark for "moral" victory to 25 per cent &#173; France continues to be shaken by rumors that he is heading for a higher percentage of the vote.

</p>

<p>

Every national and regional newspaper have urged readers to vote against Mr Le Pen. The left-of-center Lib&eacute;ration yesterday filled almost the whole of its front page with the word "Oui" and a sketch of a Chirac ballot paper.

</p>

<p>

The great unknown is how many Lib&eacute;ration readers, and other less politically engaged voters of the left, will turn out to vote for a right-wing President they dislike to block a challenger they despise.
