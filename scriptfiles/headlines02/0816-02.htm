<p>CONSERVATIVE lobbyists in the US funded by Esso have urged President Bush to 

derail the Earth summit in Johannesburg because it is “anti-freedom, anti-people, 

anti-globalization and anti-Western”. 

<P>The lobbyists, funded by the oil company that was also a big donor to the President’s 

election campaign, urged Mr Bush to make sure that global warming was kept off 

the agenda at the summit, which starts later this month. 

<P>In a letter leaked to <a href="http://www.foe.org/" target="_new">Friends of 

Earth</a> in the US, the lobbyists tell Mr Bush: “We applaud your decision not 

to attend in person . . . the summit will provide a global media stage for many 

of the most irresponsible and destructive elements in critical economic and environmental 

issues. Your presence would only help publicize various anti-freedom, anti-people, 

anti-globalization and anti-Western agendas,” it said. 

<P>Among others, the letter was signed by representatives of the Competitive Enterprise 

Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the American Enterprise 

Institute, and the National Center for Policy Analysis, all of which received 

funding from ExxonMobil, Esso’s parent company. The letter, dated August 2, adds: 

“The least important global environmental issue is potential global warming and 

we hope that your negotiators can keep it off the table and out of the spotlight.” 

<P>The World Summit on Sustainable Development will be attended by 100 world leaders. 

However, the US Government has already made clear that it will not sign any internationally 

binding agreements.</P>
