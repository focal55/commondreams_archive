<p>Anti-war fever awoke over the weekend, as about 8,000 protesters in 

San Francisco joined brethren across the country in a rising rumble against 

President Bush's drive to disarm Iraq.

</table></font>In what was proclaimed a national day of resistance, voices that were never 

muted became full-throated, amplified by anger and apprehension over saber 

rattling against Saddam Hussein.

<P>"This is the beginning of a solid anti-war movement," said Osama Qasem, 32, 

president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, who attended 

Sunday's demonstration at Union Square.

<P>"Now, there is an urgency to strengthen our movement, to say no to war," 

Qasem said. "It's high time to realize that exercising your right to freedom 

of expression does not make you un-American."

<P>Over the weekend, from the east meadow of New York's Central Park to the 

National Guard headquarters in Los Angeles, scores of thousands rallied 

against a possible war with Iraq. At the Texas state capitol, protesters 

shouted "No more blood for oil," while in Portland 5,000 people, some of them 

newly born pacifists, linked with veteran demonstrators to protest military 

intervention against Iraq.

<P>Organized by a seven-month-old, New York-based organization called Not In 

Our Name, more than two dozen other rallies were held in cities including 

Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Fresno and Minneapolis.

</table></font>Salt Lake City residents Carol Gnade and Lorraine Miller were certain their 

own town's rally would be bantam-sized compared to San Francisco's -- so they 

flew to the Bay Area in time for the protest.

<P>"Wouldn't miss this one," said Gnade. "I was so glad to finally have some 

place to come to vent our feelings. It's been frustrating reading how much 

support George Bush has for this war."

<P>Polls generally indicate support for military action against Iraq, believed 

by the Bush administration to have long been acquiring weapons of mass 

destruction, with a majority of people polled favoring multilateral backing 

through the United Nations.

<P>But in the Bay Area, with its heritage of political activism, many have 

begun expressing an uneasy foreboding.

<P>Galvanized by Bush's push for military intervention, anti-war sentiment re-

emerged Sunday into blazing sunshine and cacophony at Union Square.

<P>"Bush wants to go to war -- he's going to find a way no matter what," said 

Aimara, 28, a receptionist at an Oakland law firm and spokesperson for Not In 

Our Name. "We need to find a way to show that people aren't just going to sit 

down. I don't like Saddam. I think he's horrible. He doesn't care about the 

Iraqi people, but Bush doesn't care either. What he cares about is controlling 

the region."

<P>Not In Our Name's "pledge of resistance" was recited in assorted languages: 

<P>"We believe that as people living in the United States it is our responsibility 

to resist the injustices done by our government, in our names. .. . Another world 

is possible, and we pledge to make it real."

</table></font></font>The rally was endorsed by numerous groups including the Alameda County 

Peace and Justice Coalition, the Filipino Workers' Association, Global 

Exchange and Veterans for Peace.

<P>Some participants rode BART -- dubbed "the peace train" for the day -- into 

the city.

<P>Fittingly for the city's cornerstone of commerce, water was sold at the 

rally for $1 a bottle, buttons ("I love my country, it's the government I 

hate") went for $3.

<P>A warm-up protest was held at the foot of Powell Street by Global Exchange 

and the International Answer Coalition. Attended by several hundred protesters, 

their chants of "No blood for oil" could scarcely be heard amid the din of percussion 

instruments and Market Street denizens. 

<P>Watching bemusedly from the cable car queue was Chris Jacobsen, 19, a Coast 

Guard seaman apprentice visiting the city from Nebraska.

<P>"There's a generation gap going on here. I see a lot of old people who 

probably haven't been protesting since Vietnam," said Jacobsen, who supports 

military action in Iraq. "San Francisco has been liberal for so long, you 

expect to see demonstrations like this here. In Omaha, this would never fly."
