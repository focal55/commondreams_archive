<p>BAGHDAD   - The United States planned for a  possible war on Iraq and a post-Saddam order, but Baghdad  warned on Saturday it would fight any invaders through the  streets and teach them lessons they would never forget.<p>



		U.N. inspectors, combing Iraq for signs of illegal weapons  it denies having, checked at least five more sites around  Baghdad linked to the Military Industrialization Commission, in  charge of developing weapons and munitions.<p>



		A U.S. official said two aircraft carriers had been put on  alert for possible use against Iraq and the Washington Post  said Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has signed an order  sending "significant" ground forces and combat aircraft to the  Gulf.<p>



		Washington planners looked ahead, drawing up plans to  secure key cities and use Iraqi oil revenues for reconstruction  after a possible U.S.-led invasion toppled President Saddam  Hussein.<p>



		Iraq warned the superpower it was deluding itself.<p>



		"He who ever attacks our country will lose," Trade Minister  Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told a solidarity conference in Baghdad  where he announced extra food rations -- wheat, rice, cooking  oil and powder milk -- to help households build up reserves.<p>



		"We will fight from village to village, from city to city  and from street to street in every city. The enemy will be  taught an unforgettable lesson if it tries to attack."<p>



		Clad in military fatigues, he praised Saddam as a warrior  who would take Iraq to a bright future, and told his audience:<p>



		"Iraq's oil, nationalized by the president...from the hands  of the British and Americans in 1972...will remain in the hands  of this people and this leadership."<p>



		Baghdad says the United States and Britain want to go to  war to wrest control of the world's second largest oil  reserves.<p>



		It says they plan to invade regardless of what U.N.  inspectors, one month into a search for banned weapons of mass  destruction, conclude in a report to the Security Council due  by January 27.<p>



		Speculation has mounted war could start soon afterward.<p>



		SUFFERING<p>



		U.S. President George Bush has already said Iraq is in  "material breach" of a U.N. Security Council resolution last  month by swearing it has got rid of any atomic, biological or  chemical weapons that it still had after the 1991 Gulf war.<p>



		The resolution demanded Iraq readmit the inspectors after a  four-year gap and gave Iraq a last chance to come clean on its  weapons programs or face serious consequences.<p>



		Inspectors interviewed Kathim Jamil on Friday, a key Iraqi  scientist with expertise in restoring aluminum tubes used in  missiles. He denied any links to a nuclear program.<p>



		British aid minister Clare Short, a dove, urged Prime  Minister Tony Blair to prevail on Bush not to fight without  U.N. backing.<p>



		"We have got to try to keep the whole world together and  the U.S. together behind the authority of the U.N. and that is  where I think the UK should use its influence," she told BBC  radio.<p>



		She also echoed a warning by the U.N. refugee chief over  the suffering a war could bring to ordinary Iraqis.<p>



		As many as 9.5 million of Iraq's 22 million people could  quickly need outside food once a war began, U.N. sources say.<p>



		U.S. officials said if Saddam was ousted they would keep  the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq, at least temporarily, to  ensure post-invasion oil dollars go on basic needs.<p>



		MORE OIL?<p>



		Bush is debating whether to ramp up Iraqi oil production,  but an official said: "We aren't going to do it to benefit the  U.S."<p>



		A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  the Navy has been directed to have the George Washington and  one other aircraft carrier, with cruisers and destroyers, ready  to head to the Gulf on 96 hours' notice.<p>



		The Pentagon has decided to notify up to 50,000 ground  troops that they may be sent to the Gulf early in 2003. The  United States currently has about 60,000 troops in the region.<p>



		America, still embroiled in Afghanistan as it builds up  forces in the Gulf, also faced a shock confrontation with North  Korea, which has said it will revive its nuclear program and  announced on Friday it was expelling U.N. nuclear inspectors.<p>



		Rumsfeld warned North Korea earlier this week against  seizing on Iraq to press a nuclear weapons program, and said  Washington could fight and win two wars at once if needs be.<p></p><p align="center">Copyright 2002 Reuters Ltd</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
