PARIS (Reuters) - 

France's highest court upheld on

Wednesday a three-month jail sentence for anti-globalization

activist Jose Bove over his ransacking of a McDonald's

restaurant to protest U.S. trade barriers.

<p>



The ruling announced by the court means the sheep farmer

and left-wing campaigner has exhausted all means of appeal

against his conviction for the 1999 assault on the site of a

planned new fast-food outlet in the southern French town of

Millau.

<p>

Yet supporters of Bove, for many French a symbol of their

proud food and farming traditions, think there is a chance he

can avoid jail or get a reduced term because a lesser court

still has to rule on how the sentence will be applied.

<p>

Bove's appeal has rested on the political argument that the

attack he led with a group of other activists was "legal and

necessary" in response to punitive U.S. taxes on Roquefort

cheese and other European farm goods. He was not in court.

<p>

He is also fighting against a separate six-month jail term

handed down last December for hacking down genetically modified

rice plants in a 1999 raid on a research center. A decision on

that is not expected before the end of the year.
