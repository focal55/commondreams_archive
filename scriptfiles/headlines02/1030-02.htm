Students already have to worry about exams, essay deadlines and staying awake 

through math class. In Philadelphia, they have a new worry: What if your school 

becomes a victim of the stock market meltdown?</P> 

<P>Facing an educational crisis last year, the city handed 20 of its worst-off high schools, in some of the most abject slums in the country, to a private, for-profit company called Edison Schools Inc. Now, those institutions appear to be going the way of Enron, Tyco and WorldCom.</P>

<P>Edison, a high-flying firm that was the first school-management company traded on a stock exchange, promised to provide computers, books and new curriculums, and to raise test scores. In exchange, the school board would give the company $881 (U.S.) a student.</P>

<P>Then came the crash. Over the summer, Edison's shares slid from the year's high of $21.68 to less than a dollar on the Nasdaq Stock Market. (The company traded yesterday at about 50 cents.)</P>

<P>In the classroom, this has had some bizarre effects.</P>

<P>Days before classes were to begin in September, trucks arrived to take away most of the textbooks, computers, lab supplies and musical instruments the company had provided -- Edison had to sell them off for cash. Many students were left with decades-old books and no equipment.</P>

<P>A few weeks later, some of the company's executives moved into offices inside the schools so Edison could avoid paying the $8,750 monthly rent on its Philadelphia headquarters. They stayed only a few days, until the school board ordered them out.</P>

<P>As a final humiliation, Chris Whittle, the company's charismatic chief executive 

and founder, recently told a meeting of school principals that he'd thought up 

an ingenious solution to the company's financial woes: Take advantage of the free 

supply of child labor, and force each student to work an hour a day, presumably 

without pay, in the school offices.</P>

<P>&#34;We could have less adult staff,&#34; Mr. Whittle reportedly said at a summit for employees and principals in Colorado Springs. &#34;I think it's an important concept for education and economics.&#34; In a school with 600 students, he said, this unpaid work would be the equivalent of &#34;75 adults&#34; on salary.</P>

<P>Although Mr. Whittle said he could have the child-labor plan in place by 2004, 

school board officials were quick to say they would have nothing to do with the 

proposal.</P>

<P>Mr. Whittle's past ventures included buying Esquire magazine in the 1970s and introducing Channel One, a commercial-sponsored educational television system, into public schools in the 1980s.</P>

<P>But now he appears to have fallen on hard times, and has put up for sale his 4&#189;-hectare estate in New York's Hamptons. The home, which was listed for $46-million, has eight bedrooms, a gym, an elevator, a pool, tennis and basketball courts, and guest house.</P>

<P>Edison operates 150 schools in 23 states, but Philadelphia is its largest and most visible challenge. Last year, the school board picked the 45 worst-managed schools and announced that it would privatize them. At first, Edison was to take control of them all; later, in the face of political protests, 25 of the schools were put into the hands of non-profit school companies.</P>

<P>Edison officials were unable to implement some of their more innovative educational policies, including longer school days and years, because of Philadelphia's unions and low budgets.</P>

<P>School board officials in Philadelphia are now debating their options. &#34;We want to make sure they have the financial resources to sustain [the schools] through the school year,&#34; said Paul Vallas, the board's chief executive.</P>

<P>Mr. Vallas has taken a tough disciplinary stand with the company, withholding a $5-million payment to Edison this fall because the company was seven weeks late delivering its financial statements.</P>

<P>Edison executives say the company is sound, and that its schools will begin showing educational improvements.</P>

<P>&#34;We are not going bankrupt. There is no threat of bankruptcy. It is simply, flatly not true,&#34; Edison president Chris Cert told Michigan school board officials last week.</P>

<P>Mr. Whittle has predicted a profit of $20-million this year and announced Monday he intends to buy back 5.4 million of his company's shares, or 10 per cent.</P>

<P>He also said that 84 per cent of his schools have seen &#34;increased student performance,&#34; against 8 per cent registering declines. Test-score results for the Philadelphia schools are not yet available.</P>
