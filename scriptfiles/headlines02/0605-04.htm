<p>MONTEREY, Calif.  - 

A U.S. Air Force officer has

been suspended from duty after he wrote a letter to a

California newspaper accusing President Bush of allowing the

Sept. 11 attacks to happen "because he needed this war on

terrorism," a military official said on Tuesday.

<p>



Lt. Colonel Steve Butler was relieved of his duties as vice

chancellor for student affairs at the Defense Language

Institute pending an investigation into his letter, which was

published in the Monterey County Herald on May 26, a military

spokesman said.

<p>

Butler's letter accused Bush -- the commander in chief of

the U.S. armed forces -- of allowing the Sept. 11 attacks to

occur for his own political ends.

<p>

"Of course Bush knew about the impending attacks on

America. He did nothing to warn the American people because he

needed this war on terrorism. His daddy had Saddam and he

needed Osama," Butler's letter said.

<p>

"His presidency was going nowhere. He wasn't elected by the

American people, but placed into the Oval Office by the

conservative Supreme Court...the economy was sliding into the

usual Republican pits and he needed something to hang his

presidency on."

<p>

Butler, a 24-year Air Force veteran who served as a combat

pilot during the 1990 Gulf War, was not immediately available

for comment.

<p>

His wife, Shelly Butler, told the Herald on Tuesday that

the military had given her husband "a lot of grief" over the

letter and reassigned him to temporary duty at Travis Air Force

Base in Fairfield, California.

<p>

She said he planned to retire in several weeks.

<p>

Butler's suspension was apparently based on Article 88 of

the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which says that any

commissioned officer who uses "contemptuous words" against the

president or other senior officials may be punished by a

court-martial.

<p>

The Monterey Herald said that the last Article 88

court-martial came in 1965 when an Army second lieutenant was

prosecuted for taking part in an anti-war protest in Texas,

although the Pentagon  had "quietly issued" memos reminding

officers of the Article 88 provisions after President Clinton became embroiled in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, prompting a

number of articles and letters to the editor from military

officers.
