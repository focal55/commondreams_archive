<p>The Hollywood actor and director Sean Penn flew into Baghdad yesterday on a three-day visit to warn that a war with Iraq would be "frightening". 

<P>Penn, the former husband of Madonna and an Oscar nominee, spent yesterday afternoon touring the poorly equipped children's wards at al-Mansour hospital on the banks of the Tigris in the capital.

</table></font>The trip, he said, was an attempt to understand the growing threat of war in Iraq. "As a father, an actor, a film-maker and a patriot my visit to Iraq is for me a natural extension of my obligation to find my own voice on matters of conscience."  

<P>"I have a privileged opportunity to pursue a deeper understanding of this frightening conflict."  

<P>Penn's visit completes his transformation from Hollywood bad boy to anti-war activist.  

<P>In October, he paid $56,000 (&#163;35,000) to place an advertisement in the Washington Post against a war with Iraq.  

<P>It contained an open letter to George Bush in which he accused the US president of trying to suffocate the debate over the Iraq crisis.  

<P>He decried a cycle of foreign policy where "bombing is answered by bombing, mutilation by mutilation, killing by killing".  

<P>"Sacrificing American soldiers or innocent civilians in an unprecedented pre-emptive attack on a separate sovereign nation may well prove itself a most temporary medicine," he wrote.  

<P>Penn, who traveled to Iraq with the Washington-based <a href="http://www.accuracy.org" target="_new">Institute of Public Accuracy</a>, is staying at al-Rashid hotel, where in the lobby a mosaic of a grimacing, toothless George Bush senior is displayed above the words: "Bush is criminal."  

<P>Penn's trip may result in a fine from the US government, which bans its citizens, apart from journalists, from visiting Iraq.  

<P>He also adds his name to an eclectic list of visitors to Iraq, including the rebel Labour MP George Galloway, the Austrian far-right politican J&#246;rg Haider, and, most recently, the former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda.</p>
