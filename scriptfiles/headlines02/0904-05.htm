<p> BOGOTA - Lawmakers, human rights defenders and Colombia's attorney-general's 

office urged the government Tuesday to repeal a decision to invoke a clause that 

would allow perpetrators of war crimes to remain outside the jurisdiction of the 

International Criminal Court (ICC) for seven years.

<p> The government of Andr&#233;s Pastrana, President Alvaro Uribe's predecessor, 

acted ''behind the public's back'' by invoking Article 124 of the Rome Statute 

- the treaty that created the ICC - said Senator Jimmy Chamorro, one of the driving 

forces behind the move to ratify the treaty. 

<p> The ICC, which Colombia has ratified, has jurisdiction over genocide, war 

crimes and crimes against humanity whenever national courts are not able or willing 

to prosecute alleged perpetrators. 

<p> But Article 124 allows signatory countries to ''declare that, for a period 

of seven years after the entry into force of this statute for the state concerned, 

it does not accept the jurisdiction of the court with respect to'' war crimes 

''alleged to have been committed by its nationals or in its territory.'' 

<p> Colombia invoked that clause on Aug 5, two days before Uribe was sworn in. 

The Rome Statute went into effect on Jul 1. 

<p> Chamorro said numerous war crimes that would fall under ICC jurisdiction are 

committed in Colombia, in the context of the four- decade civil war. 

<p> Parliamentary Deputy Gustavo Petro told IPS that taking refuge in Article 

124 is ''an act of cowardice,'' because it will benefit the organizations involved 

in the armed conflict, and extend for another seven years the impunity surrounding 

war crimes committed in this South American nation of 42 million. 

<p> Petro, a former member of the now-defunct insurgent group Movimiento 19 de 

abril, said the Colombian justice system ''has failed to bring to justice the 

war criminals who are active in our country, which is one of the reasons the progressive 

factions fought for'' ratification of the Rome Statute. 

<p> The ICC is a real and effective instrument that can fill the vacuum left by 

''the state's incapacity,'' and force the participants in Colombia's armed conflict 

to act in a ''more ethical and humane'' manner, said the legislator. 

<p> The civil war leaves a death toll of around 20 people a day, only five of 

whom are armed combatants, according to human rights organizations, which complain 

that impunity for such abuses remains the norm. 

<p> The most common war crimes committed in Colombia are massacres, hostage-taking, 

indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population, the employment of toxic, unconventional 

weapons, and the recruitment of minors. 

<p> Uribe should publicly clarify whether or not he will repeal the decision to 

invoke Article 124 of the Rome Statute, said Petro. Only if Colombia decides not 

to avail itself of the seven-year grace period can the ICC be effectively applied 

in Colombia, he added. 

<p> The president's office issued a communique Monday reporting that the government 

would evaluate the issue, and clarifying that the decision to invoke Article 124 

was not irreversible. 

<p> The statement indicated that the new government had nothing to do with the 

Pastrana administration's decision. But it also asserted that the seven-year period 

in question would not imply that perpetrators of war crimes would go unpunished. 

<p> Government peace commissioner Luis Restrepo said he was inclined towards maintaining 

Pastrana's position, in order to facilitate eventual peace talks with the rebels. 

<p> But in a letter addressed to Uribe, attorney-general Edgardo Maya said that 

''if the government has any reason to maintain the seven-year transition period, 

it should clearly explain to the country its reasons for doing so.'' 

<p> If the Colombian state decides to take refuge in Article 124, it will be sending 

''the mistaken message'' that it ''does not want the ICC to learn about the grave 

violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the 

context of the armed conflict'' over the next seven years, argued Maya. 

<p> Manuel Cepeda, who sits on the Constitutional Court, said Colombia's laws 

provide for measures like amnesties and pardons, that can be declared in the case 

of peace talks with the irregular armed groups. 

<p> Cepeda said the Constitutional Court had informed Pastrana that the jurisdiction 

of the ICC over war crimes committed in Colombia would not be incompatible with 

any amnesty or pardon that ''respects the constitution and the provisions and 

norms of international law.'' 

<p> Senator Jaime Dur&#225;n said that if the government maintains ''the unpatriotic 

position taken by ex-president Pastrana, Congress should promote a censure motion,'' 

because it would amount to ''giving into blackmail from the United States.'' 

<p> According to Dur&#225;n, Washington is applying pressure to countries over 

which it has a strong influence, with a view to weakening the ICC. 

<p> The Foreign Ministry is studying a draft of a bilateral treaty proposed by 

Washington according to which U.S. troops and advisers in Colombia who commit 

crimes against humanity could not be tried by the ICC.
