<p>WASHINGTON, DC - Air pollution from refineries and factories would increase 

under new air pollution rules being prepared by the Bush administration, two studies 

suggest. The studies were commissioned by the <a href="http://www.rffund.org/RFF/News.cfm?StoryID=E00C7680-5130-4533-8F71-3A77D8CFC6EB" target="_new">Environmental 

Integrity Project</a>, a group headed by former U.S. Environmental Protection 

Agency enforcement chief Eric Schaeffer. 

<p> The reports were released Wednesday as the Environmental Protection Agency 

(EPA) prepared to report to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee 

on the process used to craft Bush administration plans to weaken emissions control 

rules for older power plants and factories. 

<p> In a letter delivered to Dr. John Graham, administrator of the federal Office 

of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Environmental Integrity Project says 

the new studies contradict Bush administration statements that broadening exemptions 

to the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act would not increase 

air pollution. 

<p> The NSR rules require aging industrial facilities to install state of the 

art pollution control equipment when upgrading or expanding their facilities in 

ways that could increase pollution emissions. The Bush administration has argued 

that the NSR provisions deter some companies from making improvements that could 

reduce emissions, but critics warn that relaxing the rules could allow facilities 

to increase their emissions with few repercussions. 

<p> The Environmental Integrity Project, funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund, 

commissioned Abt Associates Inc., a contractor for the EPA, to examine how the 

Bush administration's proposed NSR revisions would have affected two recent industrial 

cases. 

<p> The Abt report "indicates that applying just one element of the final rule 

- one that would allow a facility to avoid NSR pollution controls for projects 

that did not raise emissions above their highest level within the past ten years 

- would have increased emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by a combined total 

of 124.6 tons per year at two industrial facilities in the Midwest," wrote Tatjana 

Vujic, staff attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, in the letter to 

Dr. Graham. 

<p> The letter was also sent to Senator Jim Jeffords, chair of the Senate Environment 

and Public Works Committee, as well as the heads of the Senate Governmental Affairs 

Committee and Judiciary Committee, EPA Administrator Christie Whitman and assistant 

EPA administrator Jeffrey Holmstead. 

<p> Enforcement of the current NSR rule is based on whether industrial modifications 

increase plant emissions above a baseline computed from the plant wide average 

emissions for the two most recent years. If a facility can prove that the most 

recent emissions data is not representative of normal plant operations, they can 

submit data from previous years instead. 

<p> Under the Bush administration's proposed rule, companies could set their emissions 

baseline using the two worst polluting years of the past 10, regardless of whether 

the data from those years is representative of current plant operations. 

<p> "For example, suppose a refinery averaged annual emissions of 1,000 tons of 

NOx in 2001 and 2002, but 2,000 tons per year in 1993 and 1994," Vujic explained. 

The Bush administration rule "would allow the refinery to increase its NOx emissions 

by at least 1,000 tons in 2003 without triggering NSR or having to apply pollution 

controls because the new total of 2,000 tons per year would not exceed emission 

levels reported ten years ago. In fact, the company could release NOx emissions 

up to 2,039 tons, as that would not exceed the ten year old pollution levels by 

the 40 tons required to trigger NSR." 

<p> The Abt report looked at the effect that the Bush administration's rule would 

have had on modifications performed at ExxonMobil's Joliet, Illinois refinery, 

and a Nucor Steel mill in Montgomery County, Indiana, within the past five years. 

<p> Under current NSR rules, both facilities were required to install new emissions 

reduction equipment, slashing their emissions of nitrogen oxides. But under the 

new Bush proposal, neither plant would have had to upgrade their emissions controls, 

and could have legally increased their air polluting emissions. 

<p> "The analysis indicates that had the Administration's final rule been in effect, 

NOx emissions would have increased by 66.7 tons per year at Mobil's (now ExxonMobil's) 

Joliet, Illinois, refinery and by 57.9 tons per year at Nucor Steel's plant in 

Crawfordsville, Indiana," Vujic wrote. "A closer reading suggests that the Administration's 

proposal also could have increased sulfur dioxide emissions at the ExxonMobil 

refinery by more than 200 tons annually." 

<p> The Abt analysis found other problems with the proposed NSR revisions. The 

researchers, who used state files, EPA and state emissions inventories, and conversations 

with state permit writers, found that the EPA's National Emissions Inventory data 

"differs substantially from state emissions data for reasons that were difficult 

to determine in the time allowed for research." 

<p> "The uneven quality of the government's own data make it more likely that 

overworked state permit writers will lack any objective basis for challenging 

ten year old emission estimates that may be inflated by companies seeking to avoid 

NSR," Vujic wrote. 

<p> "The research is consistent with trends showing that emissions from industrial 

sources have gradually declined in the last ten years. That in turn suggests that 

allowing companies to 'borrow' emissions from a decade ago to avoid pollution 

control requirements will make the air dirtier, not cleaner," Vujic concluded.
