More than two million people, according to an Italian trade union, turned out in a massive protest against government plans to change the labor law and to condemn terrorism following the killing of one of reform's architects.

</font>The ancient Circus Maximus, the main rallying point, was already crowded with demonstrators at 11:30 am (1030 GMT) even as six feeder marches were bringing hundreds of thousands of banner-waving protesters from gathering points around Rome.

<p>"I believe that we are more than double the people than what we were in 1994. That's impressive," Sergio Cofferati, who heads the main Italian trade union federation CGIL said.</p>

<p>In November 1994, around one million demonstrators turned out in a demonstration to protest pension reforms, when conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was briefly in office for the first time.</p>

<p>"This is a unique and extraordinary demonstration," former leftwing prime minister Massimo d'Alema said at the protest, calling it a "symbolic battle" for worker's rights.</p>

<p>The labor reforms Berlusconi envisages would make it easier for companies to fire workers, and they have provoked strong protests among labor unions.</p>

<p>But the demonstration took on a different tone earlier this week, after a key man behind the reforms was assassinated in Bologna, in an attack claimed by the far left Red Brigades.</p>

<p>Marco Biagi, an adviser to the government, was gunned down outside his home in northern Italy on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Red Brigades, an urban guerrilla group behind a series of deadly attacks and kidnappings in the late 1970s and early 1980s, claimed responsibility for the assassination.</p>

<p>Demonstrators marched with banners such as "terrorism kills freedom" and "Don't touch Article 18", in reference to the clause in the labor law the prime minister wants to change.</p>

<p>The ancient site of Rome's chariot races, the sunken, grassy Circus Maximus is around half a mile long and around 150 meters (yards) wide, the only venue in the capital big enough to hold the one million people which the unions had been expecting.</p>
