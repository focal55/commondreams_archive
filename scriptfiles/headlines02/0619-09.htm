<p> MONTPELLIER, France   - 

Jose Bove, the radical

French farmer convicted for ransacking a McDonald's fast-food

restaurant, drove to prison Wednesday at the head of a convoy

of tractors applauded by passersby.

<p>

A long line of tractors, police and media vehicles rolled

through the southern French countryside at a stately pace,

ensuring Bove arrived some eight hours late for his 8:30 a.m.

appointment at a prison near this Mediterranean city.

of tractors on his way to prison near Montpellier, June 19, 2002, after he was 

convicted of the ransacking of a McDonalds fast food restaurant. The convoy moved 

through the French countryside at a slow pace in order to ensure that Bove missed 

his 0830 a.m appointment at the prison. Bove received a three month sentence and 

has exhausted the appeals process. Sign on Bove's tractor reads: Animal feed -

</table></font>"I am a victim of politically-motivated justice," Bove,

dressed as a convict and wearing handcuffs, told some 800

sympathizers gathered outside the prison.

<p>

"But continue the fight while I am behind bars," the

media-savvy anti-globalization activist added before passing

through the gates to serve his sentence.

<p>

The walrus-mustachioed folk hero, who attends civil rights

protests worldwide, exhausted the appeals process last year

after being sentenced to three months jail in 1999 for

attacking a half-built McDonald's in protest at U.S. trade

policy.

<p>

But officials put off summoning him to prison until after

the presidential and legislative election marathon that ended

on Sunday with a landslide victory for the center-right.

<p>

Just before leaving his home at dawn near Millau, where the

McDonald's restaurant is located, Bove called his jail sentence

"a monumental stupidity" and said it was not necessary.

<p>

Several tractors were decorated with banners supporting

Bove's struggle to defend traditional French farm products

against fast food.

<p>

"Bove to Prison -- and Chirac?" one sign asked, referring

to sleaze charges against conservative President Jacques

Chirac, who was re-elected on May 5.

<p>

"When you see all this solidarity, all the people who've

come from all around France, it's extraordinary," Bove said of

the supporters accompanying him on the journey. "It is a

struggle by citizens who refuse to be marginalized."

<p>

Bove has already spent 19 days in jail while under

investigation and may serve only 40 more days if he behaves

himself in prison, a spokesman for his Confederation Paysanne

farmers' union said.
