<p>Al-Khalil, Sept 23, IRNA -- Palestinians throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip 

and East al-Qods on Monday observed a general strike to express solidarity with 

the beleaguered Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat. 

<p>Israeli occupation tanks have been laying siege on Arafat and 250 of his aides 

and guards inside his virtually completely destroyed headquarters in Ramallah. 

<p>Schools, colleges and shops in the West Bank and Gaza remained closed as more 

demonstrations were organized in several Palestinian population centers in defiance 

of the Israeli curfew on Palestinian movement. 

<p>In some areas like in al Khalil, Israeli troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators, 

causing some casualties. 

<p>The strike comes in the aftermath of the massive and largely spontaneous demonstrations 

which took place in several Palestinian towns Saturday and Sunday after Israeli 

troops threatened to kill the Palestinian leader and his aides. 

<p>Israeli bulldozers demolished up to 90% of PA headquarters in Ramallah, generating 

widespread anger among ordinary Palestinians who viewed the destruction and the 

accompanying threats to kill Arafat as an insult to Palestinian national dignity. 

<p>The demonstrations, in which all Palestinian political groups took part, amounted 

to a moral booster to the Palestinian leader who has been isolated by Israel and 

shunned by the United States. 

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces allowed PA official Sa'eb Ureikat access 

to Arafat's encircled office. 

<p>Earlier, Ureikat said Arafat would never agree to surrender a single Palestinian 

to Israel. 

<p>Ureikat's remarks were made in reaction to an offer by Qatari Foreign Minister 

Hamad Ibn Jasem to host some 50 Palestinians holed up with Arafat whom the Zionist 

regime says are wanted for taking part in the resistance against Israeli occupation 

and apartheid. 

<p>The UN Security council is expected to discuss the standoff in Ramallah, with 

the US threatening to veto any draft resolution calling for the immediate lifting 

of the Zionist siege on the Palestinian leader. </p>
