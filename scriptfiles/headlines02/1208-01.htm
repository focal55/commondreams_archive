<p>OSLO   - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter arrived  in Oslo Sunday to collect the Nobel Peace Prize and said Iraqi  compliance with U.N. weapons inspectors was a "good step"  toward averting any U.S.-led war.<p>

</table></font>Carter, a 78-year-old Democrat, landed at Oslo airport two  days before he collects the $1.0 million prize at a glittering  prize ceremony in Oslo's City Hall.<p>



		Asked if chances of a U.S.-led war against Baghdad had  diminished because President Saddam Hussein had allowed back  U.N. weapons inspectors, he told reporters:<p>



		"Yes, I think that if Iraq does continue to comply  completely then I see no reason for the war and I think it's a  good step forward," he said. "But nobody knows what to expect."<p>



		Iraq issued a giant dossier Saturday which it says shows it  has no weapons of mass destruction despite deep skepticism by  President Bush. Bush has threatened war if the United States  judges that Baghdad is deceiving the international community.<p>



		The five-member Nobel Committee announced in October that  it was awarding Carter, who was president in 1977-81, the prize  for "decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to  international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights,  and to promote economic and social development.<p>



		But the head of the Committee, Gunnar Berge, went beyond  the official citation to say bluntly that the award was also  meant as a "kick in the legs" to Bush because of his drive to  oust Saddam.<p>



		Carter said in September that it would be a "tragic  mistake" for the United States to attack Iraq without the  support of the United Nations.<p>



		Saturday, Saddam also apologized for his country's  1990-1991 occupation of his oil-rich neighbor Kuwait. In his  letter, however, he blamed Kuwait's leadership for  precipitating the invasion.<p>



		Carter, who has worked for peace in nations from Haiti to  North Korea since he stepped down as president, will give a  news conference Monday before receiving the prize Tuesday.  "We're very grateful for the honor and looking forward to the  ceremonies," he said on behalf of himself, family, friends and  colleagues.
