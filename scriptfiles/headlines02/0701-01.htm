<p> WASHINGTON — The Bush administration has designated 33 toxic waste sites in 

18 states for cuts in financing under the Superfund cleanup program, according 

to a new report to Congress by the inspector general of the Environmental Protection 

Agency.</p>

The cuts, imposed because the cleanup fund is hundreds of millions of dollars 

short of the amount needed to keep the program on schedule, mean that work is 

likely to grind to a halt on some of the most seriously polluted sites in the 

country, confronting the surrounding communities with new uncertainty over when 

the work will resume, how quickly it will proceed and who will pay for it.</p> 

<P> Among the sites that for now would receive less money — in some cases, none 

— are a manufacturing plant in Edison, N.J., where the herbicide Agent Orange 

was produced, several chemical plants in Florida and two old mines in Montana. 

The report to Congress is the first public listing by the environmental agency 

of where it intends to cut Superfund spending. It was provided to The New York 

Times by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee who oppose the cuts.</p>

<P> The administration had already indicated it would scale back spending from 

the special fund that pays for cleaning up sites where the original polluter has 

gone out of business or is otherwise unable to pay for remediation. The fund has 

been running out of money since Congress refused several years ago to extend the 

taxes on industry that had replenished it each year. It once contained billions 

of dollars from those taxes. </p>

<P> The administration wants to reduce the payments from the fund by covering 

fewer sites. To do that it would shift the costs of further work to the government's 

general accounts, paid for by all taxpayers. Congressional critics have said this 

amounts to abandoning the precept that "the polluter pays," on which the Superfund 

program was founded.</p>

<P> While Congress theoretically could override the administration's plan and 

impose a different approach, Congress has failed in past years to resolve bitter, 

often partisan, differences among lawmakers on how to revamp the program, and 

no consensus on it has emerged this year.</p>

<P> Regional offices of the environmental agency had asked for $450 million for 

remedial action at the 33 sites, but the administration has allocated only $228 

million, the inspector general's report says.</p>

<P> Like all sites covered by the Superfund program, the 33 that are targeted 

for reductions are among the most contaminated grounds in the country and pose 

some level of health and environmental hazards to their communities. The documents 

provided by the inspector general did not indicate how these sites were chosen 

for cuts.</p>

<P> The report makes clear that under the administration's approach the costs 

of cleaning up these sites would eventually shift to all taxpayers, and that in 

the meantime the whole program would be slowed down.</p>

<P> It also shows that the administration is putting less money into continuing 

54 long-term remediation projects around the country. Regional offices of the 

Environmental Protection Agency had requested $46.7 million, but the administration 

is giving them $33.2 million.</p>

<P> Two Congressional Democrats, Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and 

Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, asked the environmental agency's inspector general 

for the report in April and provided a copy to The Times. Both represent states 

with heavy concentrations of Superfund sites.</p>

<P> Businesses have long complained about the Superfund program. At one time, 

chemical and oil companies, among others, were required to pay a special tax that 

cost them collectively about $1 billion a year. The tax went into the fund to 

clean up contaminated sites, but businesses said the system of allocating the 

money was unwieldy and badly managed.</p>

<P> The report identifies five sites for spending reductions in New Jersey, five 

in Florida, three in Texas, one in New York and one or two in several other states 

as well as in the Virgin Islands. The sites have been in various stages of cleanup 

over decades.</p>

<P> For example, in Edison, the Chemical Insecticide Corporation, which made pesticides 

and defoliants like those used by the military in the Vietnam War, including Agent 

Orange, contaminated soil and groundwater with chemicals until 1972, when the 

company went bankrupt.</p>

<P> The E.P.A. stepped in and for 11 years has been working with community and 

environmental groups to have the site cleaned up by contractors. The agency spent 

$8 million for initial remedial work but eventually determined that the best response 

would be to cart away 150,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil at a cost of $40 

million. In February, agency officials told the local groups that removal would 

begin in November.</p>

<P> The new report says that no money will be available for the project.</p>

<P> Robert Spiegel, executive director of the Edison Wetlands Association, an 

environmental group formed to monitor the cleanup, said that the environmental 

agency was under a binding agreement with the community to pay for the cleanup. 

If the Superfund does not allocate money, he said, the government's general funds 

will have to do so.</p>

<P> "They are required by law to do the remedy even if they don't have the money," 

Mr. Spiegel said. "Someone will have to pay, and the Bush administration wants 

the American people to do it."</p>

<P> It would take new Congressional action to spend federal funds other than Superfund 

reserves for cleanup.</p>

<P> Because the owner of Chemical Insecticide, Arnold Livingston, went bankrupt 

and then out of business, the cleanup money was supposed to come from the Superfund 

trust fund.</p>

<P> The fund was set up in 1980 with a special tax on chemical and oil companies 

to clean up so-called orphan sites, or those where the polluter could not be identified 

or would not pay, as well as for recalcitrant companies and emergency action.</p>

<P> But the trust fund is running out of money. Congress let the corporate taxes 

expire in 1995. Without them, the fund has dwindled from a high of $3.8 billion 

in 1996 to a projected $28 million next year. President Bush's budget made clear 

that he did not intend to reauthorize the tax.</p>

<P> The orphan sites, whose cleanup may now shift from the trust fund to general 

taxpayers, account for about 30 percent of the 1,551 sites on the Environmental 

Protection Agency's national priority list of toxic sites in pressing need of 

remediation. The total budget for the Superfund is $1.27 billion, which covers 

investigations, enforcement, litigation and engineering studies as well as cleanup.</p>

<P> Mr. Spiegel said of residents near the sites, "These people have no idea that 

all the time and energy they put into getting their sites listed and cleaned up 

has now been discarded because there is no money." He said that the administration 

was reluctant to release the information on the specific sites because "they know 

there will be some serious problems with their voters because they will be called 

to task on this."</p>

<P> Scott Stoermer, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, said that 

shifting cleanup costs from industry to taxpayers was already a potent political 

issue in certain Congressional districts and was likely to become more so in the 

current atmosphere of corporate scandals.</p>

<P> "This is all about government letting corporations get away with things that 

hurt average Americans and leave taxpayers to foot the bill," Mr. Stoermer. "It's 

not just about cleaning up toxic waste, it's about fairness and which side are 

you on."</p>
