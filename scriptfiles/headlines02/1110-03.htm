<p>The Republicans are trying not to gloat. The Democrats are licking their wounds. And the Greens? They're somewhere in between. </p>

<p>The party didn't run all that many candidates this year -- at least not compared with the major parties. Nationwide, it boasted 541 candidates, the vast majority of whom vied for either state or local offices. Of them, just 67 were elected. </p>

<p>But compared to where the party was in 2000, says Dean Myerson, national political coordinator, the gains are significant. The 500-plus candidates are about twice as many as the party ran two years ago. The 67 newly minted officials have brought the party's current total to 171. And one of those officials recently became the party's first to be elected to a state legislature (Maine).</p>

<p>Myerson attributed the increases, along with the party's expanding membership -- the Green Party counts about 250,000 members nationwide -- largely to its leftist takes on the war on terrorism and, to a lesser extent, to the cascade of corporate scandals this year. </p>

<p>And those increases have prompted the party to take on some of the trappings of big-time political parties: It has a national headquarters in Dupont Circle. It has been recognized by the Federal Election Commission as a national committee. And it has a training school, where it teaches its prospective candidates the finer points of electioneering. </p>

<p>All of that isn't to deny the fact that the party has a long way to go toward being competitive. Its candidates are routinely excluded from campaign debates, ignored by the news media, badly outspent by the major parties and, in many states, kept off the ballot. And the party, which is strongest on the West Coast, the Upper Midwest and parts of New England, has yet to make significant inroads into the South and many rural areas. </p>

<p>Still, the Green Party appears to have survived this GOP-dominated election with at least a degree of aplomb. "People look at the election as a bad election for progressives, but it was actually just a bad election for Democrats," Myerson said.</p>
