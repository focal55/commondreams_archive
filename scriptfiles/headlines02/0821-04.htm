<p> CRAWFORD, Texas -- President Bush is expected Thursday to announce changes 

in federal rules that would speed up selective logging in national forests, embarking 

on a course intended to help prevent the kind of destructive fires that have plagued 

Western states this summer.

<p>But environmentalists are complaining that the government is upending decades 

of regulations and that the White House is using fear of fires to cut down trees 

that are old but healthy, and fire-resistant, from back-country forests.

<p>Details of the plan have not been made public. But interviews with U.S. Forest 

Service officials, other administration officials and environmentalists shed light 

on its likely elements.

<p> Formulating what one senior official called a "new approach to major issues" 

affecting the management of public land, Bush is expected to propose removing 

administrative barriers to cutting timber from fire-prone forests by streamlining 

environmental reviews required before timber harvest can begin.

<p>The plan would make it harder for environmental groups, citizens and Forest 

Service employees to appeal logging plans. The timber industry views such measures 

as necessary to protect forests.

<p>Bush is flying Thursday from his ranch in Central Texas to one of southern 

Oregon's most fire-troubled areas near the border with California to make the 

announcement. Oregon and California are among several states that have suffered 

catastrophic wildfires this season.

<p>The plan would make it easier to get approval to thin underbrush and small 

noncommercial trees as well as "thinning out some commercial-grade wood" in areas 

at high risk of fire, a senior administration official said.

<p>It is built around restructuring the rules that govern appeals of federal decisions 

affecting the environment, making the National Environmental Policy Act less cumbersome. 

The measure has regulated governmental environmental action for three decades.

<p>A senior administration official emphasized that the plan was not intended 

to open the national forests to "wholesale commercial logging" but rather to remove 

the most flammable wood in the forests.

<p>If the choice is between thinning the forest and putting entire ecosystems 

at risk, he said, "some thinning is the way to go."

<p>He said the plan is built around a 10-year strategy adopted in May by administration 

officials, 17 governors from both parties, local and tribal officials, academics 

and environmentalists to seek consensus on the treatment of federal forests.

<p>It will involve both changes in regulations, intended to make federal agency 

environmental rules more consistent with each other, and greater consideration 

for the effect logging would have on animals and other plants earlier in the process. 

Some changes will require congressional action.

<p>Reflecting the need to win approval of the House and Senate and foreshadowing 

lengthy political fights to accomplish the full goals Bush is likely to outline, 

a senior forest official said: "My gut tells me if we could have done them on 

our own we would have done them.... We can't do it without going to Congress."

<p>Adding that greater attention is needed to the dangers that lurk in forests 

in which brush, dead trees and other fuel have been allowed to build up, he referred 

to the current rash of fires and warned: "We could have many, many years just 

like this."

<p>But environmentalists argue that the administration is using the fires as an 

excuse to reach for much broader changes.

<p>"We're all stuck on fires right now, but the Bush administration is talking 

about changes in environmental law on the books since 1970," said Susan Ash, wilderness 

campaign director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, an environmental group.

<p>But, said Chris West, a vice president of the American Forest Resource Council, 

a timber industry group: "We've burned up half a million acres of Oregon's forests. 

It's high time the federal government began to seriously address concerns about 

the health of Western forests."

<p>By delving into the forestry issue, Bush is entering an area of great political 

sensitivities in Oregon: In the most populated regions of the state, around Portland, 

there are strong environmental sentiments likely to oppose measure to promote 

logging. But pollsters report that in the rural areas more economically dependent 

on the forests, support grows for more aggressive logging.

<p>With unemployment above 7%, Oregon has consistently been one of the states 

with the highest rate of joblessness over the last year. The timber industry, 

once the top source of employment, has been passed by the high-tech industry as 

the state's biggest provider of jobs.

<p>Bob Moore, a public opinion researcher who conducts polls for Republican candidates 

as well as timber concerns and utilities, said that concern about forest fires 

had grown so great that "any action &#91;by Bush&#93; is going to be seen as potentially 

helpful."

<p>"The feeling is a lot of ground is being burned and the federal government 

hasn't done anything about it."

<p>Timber sale appeals and court rulings have played a major role in shaping Forest 

Service policy in the last 15 years. Logging levels fell sharply in the Pacific 

Northwest in the wake of court rulings to protect the northern spotted owl habitat, 

and environmental groups have used timber sale appeals to modify or sometimes 

halt logging plans they believe violate environmental laws.

<p>Limiting those reviews would require congressional action and would erode a 

fundamental right of the public to play a part in management of public lands, 

environmental activists complained.

<p>"If what they're going to do is waive our environmental laws, it's going to 

take congressional action to do it," said Marty Hayden, legislative director of 

Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.

<p>"If you eliminate appeals and judicial review, you've largely taken the public 

out of having a meaningful role in the process," Hayden added. "Without the avenue 

to hold government accountable to play by the law, then what you're left with 

is, 'Thank you very much for your input. We'll get back to you later.' "

<p>In 1995, after a series of wildfires, Congress waived environmental reviews 

of sales of salvaged timber across the country for 18 months.

<p>"It caused the reemergence of timber wars in the Pacific Northwest that had 

started to quiet down," Hayden said. "The controversy ... far overshadowed anything 

it accomplished. Its legacy still haunts the Forest Service today, and I think 

Congress will be less inclined to do that kind of sweeping waiver."

<p>Today several major environmental groups are calling for the Forest Service 

to direct the bulk of its fire prevention efforts and funding to land bordering 

houses and towns.

<p>"Let's put the money where it does the most good," said Sean Cosgrove, national 

forest policy specialist for the Sierra Club.

<p>Under a seven-point plan they are releasing in Oregon, the Sierra Club, Wilderness 

Society, Oregon Natural Resources Council and other groups are urging the Bush 

administration to spend $10 billion over the next five years to protect communities 

and homes from wildfire. 

<p>National fire policy emphasizes community protection, but a great deal of forest 

thinning is underway outside of community zones. Reviewing current forest spending 

in California, for instance, The Times found that national forests in the most 

remote parts of Northern California were receiving the most generous budgets for 

fuel reduction projects, with the least going to forests near urban areas.
