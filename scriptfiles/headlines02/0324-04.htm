BAGHDAD  - 

An Iraqi vet said on Saturday thousands

of fish that have died at fish farms near Baghdad were poisoned

by munitions used by British and U.S. forces.

<p>

"Mortality rate among fish has reached 100 percent in some

of the fish farms," said Dhahir Habib Dhahir, a veterinary

surgeon at state-run Swairah fish farm 30 miles south of the

capital.

<p>

Iraqi television showed large quantities of the diseased

fish being burned by workers at one of the fish farms.

<p>

"Researchers and specialists have attributed this disease

which affected the fish to the use of banned weapons dropped by

American forces against Iraq," the vet told Reuters television.

<p>

Head of the farm Adel al-Samaraee said the Iraqi

Agriculture Ministry was due to study the fish, adding that the

deaths were "clearly caused by depleted uranium and poisonous

materials dropped by American and British forces."

<p>

Depleted uranium is used as a component of armor piercing

munitions. When a uranium-tipped weapon hits an object, it

produces a vapor that is weakly radioactive.

<p>

Iraqi authorities say the allied forces used an estimated

300 tons of depleted uranium munitions against Iraq in the

U.S.-led 1991 offensive to recapture Kuwait.

<p>

The fish farms are within a southern no-fly zone set up by

the United States, Britain and France after the 1991 Gulf War 

to prevent possible attacks by Baghdad forces on Shi'ite

Muslims.

<p>

A similar no-fly zone was established in the north to

protect a Kurdish enclave. Baghdad, which does not recognize

the zones, says U.S. and British warplanes patrolling them have

frequently hit Iraqi targets.

<p>

Iraq also says the number of cancer cases among Iraqis has

soared since the Gulf War because of depleted uranium.

<p>

Last year, the World Health Organization  began an in-depth

study into the health impact of the shells used in Iraq.

<p>

In November, however, after lobbying from Washington, the

United Nations General Assembly voted down an Iraqi proposal

for a U.N.-backed study into the effects of depleted uranium

shells in the Gulf War.

<p>

A report by Britain's Royal Society scientific organization

published earlier this month said topsoil in areas heavily

contaminated with depleted uranium should be removed and water

quality should be monitored for any contamination.</p>
