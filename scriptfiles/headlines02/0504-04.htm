<p>WALLA WALLA, Wash., May 1 — It has been months since they took down the American flags that had been fastened to virtually every sign post on Main Street here. At least that long ago, Stone Creek Furniture stopped blasting "God Bless America" endlessly from speakers outside the shop.</P> <P> But residents of this town near fertile farms and vineyards in southeastern Washington have not forgotten Sept. 11. Nor have they forgotten how President Bush responded.</P> <P> In three dozen interviews here over the last three days, almost everyone agreed: Even Democrats who might never have had a kind word for Mr. Bush recall with pride his handling of the terrorist attacks. One after another, voters cited the president's speech to Congress nearly two weeks after the attacks as a turning point in how they viewed him and how they still see him today.</P> <P> "I thought we were in for a terrible four years," said Scott Moore, 45, a recreational planner who backed Al Gore and took a break from shooting hoops to ponder the Bush presidency. "But I guess he has a little bit more charisma than I give him credit for. Especially his speech after Sept. 11. It was somewhat inspirational."</P> <P> Yet among Democrats, independents and many Republicans — who are dominant in this city of about 30,000 that voted heavily for Mr. Bush — there are stirrings of discontent about other aspects of Mr. Bush's presidency, signs that he might not be able to continue to rely on the post-Sept. 11 good will. </P> <P> Many voters said they were alarmed by the bloodshed in the Middle East and distressed that the United States had not settled on a proper role. Others in this town of nature trails (Lewis and Clark made their way through the Walla Walla valley) and unspoiled forest accused Mr. Bush of sacrificing the environment for friends in the oil business. Still others worried that Mr. Bush had frittered away the budget surplus.</P> <P> "I don't think the jury's in on Bush yet," said Lee White, 61, a retired civilian Air Force employee who voted for Mr. Bush. "I think 9/11 was tough all right, but I'm really worried about his Middle East policies. Colin Powell's recent trip there was a complete flop."</P> <P> Such mixed sentiments may help explain why nationally, in the New York Times/CBS News poll completed this week, Mr. Bush still registered a lofty 73 percent job approval rating, even though it was down from an even loftier 82 percent in January.</P> <P> Charles DeWitt, 70, a retired state transportation official who voted for Mr. Gore, said of Mr. Bush's handling of the terrorist attacks: "I applaud him for that. But I'm simply dismayed at the Bush foreign policy in the Middle East. I watch the news every night and there doesn't seem to be any real sense of direction."</P> <P> For all the anguish over the Middle East here in the Fifth Congressional District, where Representative George Nethercutt, a Republican, toppled Speaker Tom Foley in 1994, not everyone pointed a finger at Mr. Bush. Many said the situation was so intractable that no American president could have a remedy.</P> <P> "The only way this is going to be settled is if the Lord comes back and settles it," said William Schisler, 52, a retired school custodian who voted for Mr. Bush. "These people have been fighting since the start of the world." Turning to Mr. DeWitt, he added, "How can you provide leadership to a bunch of terrorists?"</P> <P> Mr. Bush may never win over some Democrats, even those who liked his leadership after Sept. 11 and do not fault him on the Middle East.</P> <P> "I don't have any complaints," Cindy McClure, 44, a college psychology instructor, said of Mr. Bush's handling of the terrorist attacks. But, she went on: "It's a lovely facade. I'm not convinced there's a lot of depth or sincerity. He says all the right things to appeal to the masses."</P> <P> By contrast, Dale Schroeder, 60, a property manager, said he found Mr. Bush's personality one of his most appealing qualities. "He's a down-home, folksy kind of guy that people from Walla Walla can relate to," Mr. Schroeder said. "He's not impressed with the Hollywood scene or the big-city bureaucrats. I'm so thankful we have him as president."</P> <P> Still, even Mr. Schroeder is not entirely pleased with Mr. Bush, for whom he voted. "I was disappointed at the connection with Enron," he said. "That those people were his main supporters surprised me."</P> <P> Ned Shafer, 59, director of the Walla Walla YMCA, said he tended to vote Democratic but was "proud of Bush and proud of his response" after Sept. 11. But Mr. Shafer said he worried about Mr. Bush's nimbleness on complicated issues. </P> <P> "Sometimes he is too simplistic," he said. "He distills things down too simply." He also expressed qualms about Mr. Bush's leadership on the economy, saying: "I thought the tax rebate was a very flawed thing. Republicans gave away the surplus. I thought it was just ridiculous."</P> <P> Gordon Venneri, 48, the co-owner of a winery who considers himself a fiscally conservative Democrat, said he, too, was wary of Mr. Bush's spending priorities, including efforts to improve security at airports.</P> <P> "We're paying a huge amount of money for people to take your corkscrews at airports," Mr. Venneri said. "Does that just make us feel better?"</P> <P> Many Democrats and Republicans here said they were nervous that Mr. Bush was not sufficiently concerned about the environment.</P> <P> "He's done a good job on the war against terrorism," said Keola Whittaker, 23, a debate coach at Whitman College who calls himself a liberal Republican, "but his biggest downfall domestically is that he ignores the environment."</P> <P> Many voters here said they were especially impressed that Mr. Bush had surrounded himself with capable people like Vice President Dick Cheney. But the name that came up again and again was the secretary of state, Colin L. Powell. Even while some questioned whether Secretary Powell had an adequate say in Middle East policy, many people sounded more enamored of him than of the man who appointed him.</P> <P> "Colin Powell is cool, he's intelligent, he's the one I've always wanted to run but he's too smart to do it," said Mike Ellis, 63, a building superintendent who supported Mr. Bush.</P> <P> The one person Mr. Ellis has no fondness for is John Ashcroft, the attorney general. Judging from the interviews, Mr. Ashcroft seemed to touch a decidedly negative nerve with many residents, particularly over the issue of civil liberties.</P> <P> "He's the only one in there that I dislike," Mr. Ellis said. "He scares me when he talks."</P> <P> One Democrat who did not fare well in the interviews was Al Gore. Almost all voters who said they backed him in 2000 said they were not ready to commit to him again, and most said they wanted a new face.</P> <P> "Gore's time has passed," Mr. Moore said. "I don't think the election should have been close."</P> 

<P> For now, at least, Mr. Bush can take heart that even many Democrats offered their grudging admiration. "Who am I to say if he's the right person to be in that position?" said Dov Friedman, 36, a drummer who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. "But I will say he's not as big a buffoon as I thought he would be."</P>
