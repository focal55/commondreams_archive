<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->President Fidel Castro has called on Cubans to march in support of socialism and rejecting "threats" by US President George W. Bush.

<p>The march Wednesday will convene at least a million Cubans in Havana alone, so that Bush can "see the Cuban people mobilized," Castro said Monday in a speech to leaders of Cuban mass organizations.</p>

<p>The demonstration will be the latest Cuban response to Bush's call for democratic opening on the communist-ruled island, and vow to uphold the 41-year-old US economic embargo on Cuba unless Havana holds certifiably free and fair elections and overhauls its economic system.</p>

<p>Bush also warned in a June 1 speech at the US Military Academy at West Point, New York, that the US war on terrorism may often require preemptive military action against nations that support terrorism. Cuba is one of seven countries the US State Department lists as state supporters of terrorism.</p>
