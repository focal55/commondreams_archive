</font></font></font></font></font>A defiant 88-year-old nun and her sister, who have now served six-month 

      federal prison sentences for protesting at a US military base allegedly 

      linked to Central American death squads, say the two will continue to 

      pursue their cause.

    

<p>

      

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font></font></font>&quot;Whatever you do, please say we'll continue with this because the school 

      is not closed and that is our goal,&quot; said Dorothy Marie Hennessey, a 

      retired Franciscan nun convicted with two dozen other protesters 

      including her sister, Gwen, of trespassing at the former School of the 

      Americas in November 2000.

    

<p>

      &quot;I haven't changed my mind, haven't made an act of contrition for 

      anything I did. If God is anything, he's against injustice to the poor 

      and the marginalised,&quot; said Dorothy Marie, who lives with Gwen at 

      Sisters of St. Francis of the Holy Family, a convent and retirement home 

      for 425 nuns in Dubuque.

    </p>

<p>

      The Hennessey sisters were among 3,500 protesters who marched onto the 

      grounds of the former School of the Americas at Fort Benning in 

      Columbus, Georgia, where several Central American military leaders later 

      implicated in death squads received training.

</font></font></font></font></font></font>The protesters held crosses bearing the names of slain victims of 

      Central American death squads, and the Hennesseys were among a group who 

      received warnings and were prosecuted for repeated incursions onto the 

      base.

<p>

      

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font></font></font></font>The sibling nuns made international headlines in mid-July for refusing a 

      judge's offer of serving their sentences under house arrest and instead 

      reported to a federal prison in Pekin, Illinois. The stoop-shouldered 

      Dorothy Marie, one of 15 children, told the judge, &quot;I am not an invalid.&quot;



    </p>

<p>

      She said the attention to their cause was invaluable, though prison had 

      some &quot;not-so-nice&quot; drawbacks.

    </p>

<p>

      &quot;One of the things about prison is that there were some people... who 

      were not exactly mean, but they acted mean,&quot; Dorothy Marie said, adding 

      she had to surrender her own watch and buy one at the prison commissary.

    </p>

<p>

      About midway through her six-month sentence, Dorothy Marie was moved to 

      a prison halfway house in Dubuque - where she had served on the board of 

      directors - for medical reasons. Gwen, who turned 69 while in prison, 

      served out her six-month term.

    </p>

<p>

      &quot;We had a beautiful welcoming ceremony this afternoon. Gwen got up here 

      in time from Pekin,&quot; Dorothy Marie said.

    </p>

<p>

      The sisters say their activism was stoked by their late brother, Ron, 

      who spent years in Guatemala and El Salvador in the 1980s and recounted 

      in letters to them the slaughter of native peoples by military death 

      squads. He had also befriended Bishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, who 

      was assassinated.
