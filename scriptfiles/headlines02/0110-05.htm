WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 — FedEx  unwittingly carried a package from Paris to New Orleans last week that was emitting so much radiation that the recipient, a company that packages radiation sources for industrial testing, has been unable to get near enough to measure it directly.

<P> But FedEx officials said the fact that the container passed undetected through the company's system did not indicate a security risk, because the shipper and the recipient were known to FedEx, allowing easy approval of the shipment.</p>

<P> If terrorists had tried to ship radioactive material they would have failed, the company said, because extra precautions would have been taken in the case of an unknown shipper or recipient.</p>

<P> FedEx never monitored the radiation while the shipment was in its custody. The recipient, the Source Production and Equipment Company, notified FedEx of the radiation after a FedEx truck delivered the 300-pound package to the company's factory in St. Rose, La. </p>

<P> The company told FedEx in an initial estimate that the dose at the surface was 10 rem per hour. If that is correct, a person exposed to the radiation would exceed the annual limit for exposure in half an hour, and within a few hours would show effects from radiation poisoning.</p>

<P> At the Texas office of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Chuck Cain, the acting director of the materials branch, said that "this event could have had very serious consequences."But Mr. Cain added that it did not appear that anyone had absorbed a large dose.</p>

<P> The package contained Iridium- 172, which is used for industrial radiography. The radioactive material is put behind a heavy piece of metal, and by measuring what comes through the other side, technicians can look for cracks or other flaws. </p>

<P> The shipper was a Swedish manufacturer, Studsvik. </p>

<P> Scott A. Mugnow, director of safety at FedEx, said the pilots on the plane that carried the shipment were equipped with badges that measure radiation, and that when those were processed they did not show significant exposure. But other workers who handled the shipment did not have such badges. FedEx is trying to calculate their exposure. Mr. Mugnow would not describe how a package from an unknown shipper would have been treated differently.</p>

<P> The president of the Source Production did not return phone calls over two days.</p>
