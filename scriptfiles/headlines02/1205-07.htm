<p>LONDON - The <a href="http://www.cnduk.org/welcome.htm" target="_new">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> (CND) has filed a

case in the High Court in London to stop the British government from going

to war

with Iraq.

<p>

   A petition filed by the CND is due to be argued in court on Monday

December 9. The court will decide then whether this unprecedented action is

justifiable.

<p>

   The case for the CND is being prepared by the Matrix chamber of

barristers

of which Cherie Blair, wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, is a member. A CND

spokesman told IPS Wednesday, however, that Cherie Blair is not personally

involved in the case.

<p>

   The case rests on the text of the United Nations Resolution 1441. The CND

argues that it

is normal to use the expression "any necessary means" to denote sanction of

military action. "No such expression appears in the resolution," Tony Myers,

campaigns officer with CND told IPS Wednesday. "We are arguing that military

action would be unlawful without going back to the UN and seeking express

approval for it."

<p>

   Myers acknowledged that "there is no precedent for a small organization

going to court to stop a government going to war." But he said the CND is

hopeful that the court will admit the case at the preliminary hearing on

Monday.

<p>

   A petition has been filed in the High Court against Prime Minister Tony

Blair, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon. The

CND case will be argued by Rabinder Singh and Charlotte Kilroy of Matrix,

and

Michael Fordham of Blackstone Chambers.

<p>

   The hearing will take place the day after December 8, which is the date

for Iraq to comply with the requirement to list all the sites and programs

relevant to weapons of mass destruction.

<p>

   "If war on Iraq is unleashed, 500,000 could die," says Carol Naughton,

chair of CND. "We face the real possibility of a first use of a nuclear

weapon, which could be British, American or Israeli. We are acting on behalf

of all the citizens of the world who want to stop war on Iraq."

<p>

   The CND campaign is being supported by several MPs.

<p>

   The petition filed in the court says: "Security Council Resolution 1441

does not authorize the use of force by member states of the UN. The UK would

be in breach of international law if it were to use force against Iraq in

reliance on Resolution 1441 without a further Security Council Resolution."

<p>

   The petition points out that the UN Security Council resolution offers

Iraq a "final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations". The

petition points out that paragraphs 4, 11 and 12 of Resolution 1441 deal

with

the event of non-compliance by Iraq with the terms of the resolution.

<p>

   The petition points out that the resolution says noncompliance"shall

constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations and will be

reported to the Council for assessment." The resolution therefore fully

respects the competence of the Security Council in the maintenance of

international peace and security, in conformity with the Charter of the

United Nations, the petition says.

<p>

   "But despite these clear statements on the meaning of SCR 1441, several

ministers of the UK government and United States officials have indicated

that, in the

event of noncompliance with SCR 1441 by Iraq, the UK and the U.S. would be

entitled to take military action against Iraq even without a further

Security

Council resolution," the petition says.

<p>

   The petition argues that the use of force by Britain against Iraq would

not be justified under international law unless: (a) Iraq mounted a direct

attack on the United Kingdom or one of its allies and that ally requested

the

United Kingdom's assistance; or (b) an attack by Iraq on the United Kingdom

or one of its allies was imminent and could be averted in no way other than

by the use of force; or (c) the United Nations Security Council authorized

the use of force in clear terms.

<p>

   The petition says: "It would be extraordinary if, having failed to obtain

an express authorization for the use of force, having incorporated minute

changes to the final draft whose sole purpose was to exclude the possibility

of 'automaticity' and 'hidden triggers'  and to preserve the role of the

Security Council, and having publicly agreed in their explanation of the

vote

for adoption of SCR 1441 that there was no such implied authorization for

force, the UK and the U.S. were to be able to use SCR 1441 as authority for

the use of force without a further Security Council Resolution."

<p>

   The petition adds: "In our view the implied authorization arguments put

forward by the UK and the U.S. Would undermine the control exercised by the

Security Council which is an essential feature of lawful delegation under

the

Chapter VII. These arguments would effectively allow member states to take

unilateral decisions on the interpretation of resolutions, reading into them

authorization to take action which does not appear clearly on the face of

the

resolution."

<p>

   Government solicitor Diana Babar said in reply to the petition that it

seeks an assurance from the British government that it will not attack Iraq

without a further resolution from the UN Security Council, but that "there

is

no legal obligation upon the proposed defendants to provide any such

assurance, and they do not consider it appropriate to provide such an

assurance."

<p>

   The government solicitor said in reply: "There is no legal obligation

upon

the proposed defendants to engage in a debate about legal analysis...and

they

decline to do so."  The statement added: "There are a number of legal

reasons

why any attempt by your client to claim relief in the courts in relation to

these matters should not succeed, and would be strongly resisted by my

clients."

<p>

   The government solicitor said "the matter is non-justifiable and the

courts will not intervene to dictate the conduct of foreign policy,

especially, we would add, in a matter of high policy relating to a decision

as to whether and when the United Kingdom would engage in military action

against another state." </p>
