<p> THE United States was told last night that a war to oust President Saddam 

Hussein would “open the gates of Hell” in the Middle East. 

<P>The chief of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, issued the warning after a meeting 

in Cairo of the foreign ministers from 20 Arab states. He urged Iraq, however, 

to readmit weapons inspectors in co- ordination with the United Nations. 

<P>The ministers issued a resolution calling for a “complete rejection of threats 

of aggression against some Arab countries, in particular Iraq”. 

<P>Their statement did not specifically refer to weapons inspectors, but Mr Moussa 

said that the ministers had agreed that they must be allowed back as part of an 

overall solution. 

<P>Mr Moussa was asked by CNN after the two-day meeting whether he believed that 

Saddam would use weapons of mass destruction against the US. “No, I don’t think 

Iraq is in a position to reach the US, or any of the interests of the United States,” 

he said. 

<P>“However, if there is a threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq coming 

back, then the role is for us to bring back the inspectors.” 

<P>Mr Moussa said that Arab states were seeking a diplomatic solution and had 

already helped to bring Iraqi and UN officials together. The resolutions on Iraq 

also called for the lifting of UN sanctions. 

<P>Mr Moussa’s warning came as up to 100 British and American aircraft took part 

in a routine retaliatory strike on an Iraqi military installation in the south 

of the country. 

<P>Coalition combat aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly zone had earlier been 

fired on by Iraqi air defenses. It was decided to respond with a larger than usual 

strike force. 

<P>The Ministry of Defense said that 12 aircraft had dropped bombs on Iraqi targets 

— nine American F15 Strike Eagles and three RAF Tornado GR4s. 

<P>The others were support aircraft including air-refueling tankers, air Defense 

aircraft and AWACS early warning aircraft. An MoD spokeswoman said: “This was 

a bigger package of aircraft than usual. It was not exceptional.”</p> </P>
