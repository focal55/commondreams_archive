<p> WASHINGTON &#0151; A federal appeals court has ruled that billions of dollars 

in damages that the Energy Department is likely to owe to nuclear reactor owners 

for its failure to store nuclear waste will have to come from taxpayers, not electricity 

consumers.</p>

<P> The Energy Department signed contracts with reactor owners in the early 1980's 

promising to accept their wastes for burial beginning in January 1998, in exchange 

for payments from them based on electricity production. To date, reactor owners 

have paid more than $10.5 billion.</p>

<P> But now the department says it cannot take waste until 2010, and the operators 

of the reactors are suing because they have been forced to store the waste on 

site.</p>

<P> Many experts say the storage cannot start for many years, because of uncertainties 

about Yucca Mountain, the site near Las Vegas that the government has chosen as 

its waste repository.</p>

<P> Estimates of the damages run from $2 billion to $60 billion, and the decision, 

from the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, twice 

used the word "nebulous" to describe them. At the National Association of Regulatory 

Utility Commissioners, which is made up of state officials, Brian J. O'Connell, 

the director of the Nuclear Waste Program office, said the number would run "in 

the billions." Asked if it would reach tens of billions, Mr. O'Connell, said, 

"It gets fuzzy."</p>

<P> He said that one utility, Northern States Power of Minnesota, put its costs 

at $1 billion because it might be forced to shut three reactors prematurely, for 

want of storage space for the radioactive waste.</p>

<P> The only settlement so far is much smaller. The department and the owners 

of the three-reactor Peach Bottom plant, in the Pennsylvania town of the same 

name, agreed on $80 million, to pay extra costs for storing the wastes on site, 

in giant steel and concrete casks. But 13 other reactor owners sued to block the 

deal, because the money would have come from the Nuclear Waste Fund, money from 

power customers that they said was supposed to be used only to open a permanent 

repository.</p>

<P> In a decision dated Sept. 24, the appeals court ruled that money in the fund 

can only be used for permanent disposal. The court said that the Nuclear Waste 

Policy Act, the law that allowed the contracts, called for a quid pro quo "in 

which each utility roughly pays the costs of disposing of its waste and no more." 

The plan, the court said was for a system in which the burden of the government's 

breach of contract would "fall on the government, not other utilities."</p>

<P> A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Jay E. Silberg, said that if the Energy Department 

could use the money collected from utilities to pay damages to the utilities, 

the department would be "robbing Peter to pay Peter."</p>

<P> "The lesson learned from the court's ruling is that we need to move forward 

with the Yucca Mountain Project," said Joseph H. Davis, a spokesman for the Department 

of Energy.</p>

<P> At the Regulatory Utility Commissioners group, Mr. O'Connell said the decision 

was a victory because "ratepayers had some assurance that the nuclear waste fund 

would continue to be used for its intended purpose." But he acknowledged that 

if the burden shifted to taxpayers, it would be paid by most of the same people. 

"There's about an 80 percent convergence," he said.</p>
