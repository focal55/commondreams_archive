<p><i> The Gulf War and sanctions reportedly have resulted in more than 1 million 

Iraqi deaths, half of which were children younger than 5. Prohibitions on replacing 

such "dual-use" items as water pumps, generators and chlorine resulted in lethal 

epidemics. As U.S. lawmakers debate whether the military should again strike at 

Saddam's regime or simply tighten the trade embargo, Iraqis brace for the next 

round of crossfire. </i> 

<P> WASHINGTON &#151; Massive new irrigation systems stretching across the breadbasket 

regions of rural Iraq would normally be cause for celebration. In a nation where 

nearly a quarter of the children suffer chronic malnutrition, abundant crops of 

wheat and barley would signify hope and progress. 

<P> But when Hans von Sponeck, former assistant secretary general of the United 

Nations, visited Iraq last month he found neither: The spigots were turned off. 

Although the sophisticated sprinkler systems had survived the exhaustive screening 

of U.N. trade sanctions, the water pumps had not. 

<P> "The danger is these pumps could be used by the (Iraqi) military for other 

purposes," said von Sponeck, a 32-year veteran of the United Nations who resigned 

two years ago to protest the sanctions. "Anything that has a sophisticated pumping 

mechanism can be used for propelling weapons of mass destruction, I guess." 

<P> Such is life in Iraq a dozen years after the international trade sanctions 

of Aug. 6, 1990, attempted to peacefully push Iraqi President Saddam Hussein back 

from Kuwait, and 11 years after the allied forces of the Persian Gulf War rained 

bombs on Baghdad. 

<P> The ongoing collateral damage of the war and sanctions on Iraqi civilians 

has totaled more than 1 million deaths, half of which are children younger than 

5, according to UNICEF and World Health Organization reports. 

<P> As U.S. lawmakers this summer debate whether the military should again strike 

at Saddam's regime or simply tighten the trade embargo, Iraqi civilians live in 

dread of the inevitable crossfire. More than 700 targets were bombed in 1991 to 

cripple Saddam &#151; bridges, roads and electrical grids that powered 1,410 water-treatment 

plants for Iraq's 22 million people. 

<P> Coupled with the U.N. sanctions that blocked or rationed dual-use imports 

such as the water pumps, electric generators and chlorine &#151; that also can 

be used in the making of mustard gas &#151; epidemics ensued. Iraqi children died 

from dehydration and waterborne illnesses such as cholera, diarrhea and other 

intestinal diseases. 

<P> At his confirmation hearing last year, Secretary of State Colin Powell laid 

the blame at Saddam's feet. 

<P> "No one cares for children more than I do," Powell said. "And I understand 

that a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon of a Saddam Hussein threatens not 

only the children of Iraq but the entire region far more than tightened sanctions." 

<P> At the freshly painted Al-Mansour Children's Hospital in Baghdad, pediatrician 

Qusay Al-Rahim said the nation that once was among the most industrialized in 

the Middle East has made some progress in the past decade. Electricity is again 

reliable. More than half the pharmaceutical drugs his patients need are available. 

Hospital elevators work and colostomy bags no longer have to be washed and reused. 

<P> The sanctions &#151; which have been maintained because Saddam refuses to 

comply with U.N. resolutions for arms inspections &#151; do not prevent the import 

of food and most medicines. 

<P> But, Al-Rahim said, infants and children still die from a lack of common equipment 

and supplies that were readily available before Saddam's stubborn stand against 

the West. 

<P> "For example, we have a shortage of Vitamin K," he said of the coagulant used 

to prevent hemorrhaging in newborns. 

<P> In an independent study published 19 months after the six-week Gulf War, The 

New England Journal of Medicine reported a trend that foretold Iraq's future. 

<P> During the first eight months of 1991, nearly 47,000 more children than normal 

died in Iraq, and the country's infant- and child-mortality rates more than doubled, 

to 92.7 and 128.5 per 1,000 live births respectively. 

<P> A 1999 UNICEF study showed a continuing trend: In 1998, the infant- and child-mortality 

rates were 103 and 125 per 1,000, respectively. 

<P> The U.N. oil-for-food program was created five years ago to generate some 

sense of normalcy for Iraqis. Yet as of Tuesday, it was still withholding more 

than 1,450 import contracts worth $4.6 billion in humanitarian supplies for Iraq. 

A U.N. pledge in May to regenerate and expedite the contracts, so far, has produced 

only a trickle of change &#151; 14 humanitarian supply contracts worth $7.6 million. 

<P> The United States, concerned with Saddam's potential for developing weapons 

of mass destruction, initiated roughly 90 percent of the blocks on humanitarian 

supplies by the U.N. Security Council. 

<P> In Amman, Jordan, this summer, Jordanian Minister of Water Munther Haddadin 

addressed the plight of Iraqi children, who, for example, suffered almost a fourfold 

increase in low birth weights (4.5 percent to 21.1 percent) between 1990 and 1994. 

The rate remains steady today at 25 percent. 

<P> "You wonder why there are terrorists?" Haddadin asked, according to writer 

Jane McBee, who toured the Middle East with members of the Physicians for Social 

Responsibility. "What do you think these children will be in 10 years? Do you 

think they'll join the Peace Corps?" 

<P> Less than a month after the Gulf War, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez 

de Cuellar told the U.N. Security Council the conflict had "wrought near-apocalyptic 

results upon the economic infrastructure of what had been, until January 1991, 

a rather highly urbanized and mechanized society." 

<P> In a letter to the council dated March 20, 1991, de Cuellar wrote: "Iraq has, 

for some time to come, been relegated to a pre-industrial age, but with all the 

disabilities of post-industrial dependency on an intensive use of energy and technology." 

<P> It was a result the United States predicted even as allied forces bombed Iraq's 

civilian infrastructure. 

<P> In a January 1991 document titled "Iraq Water Treatment Vulnerabilities," 

the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said the bombing of Iraq coupled with an 

embargo of chemicals and supplies could fully degrade Iraq's civilian water supply. 

<P> "Unless the water is purified with chlorine, epidemics of such diseases as 

cholera, hepatitis, and typhoid could occur," read declassified portions of the 

report. 

<P> George Washington University professor Thomas Nagy stumbled across the document 

in 1998 during online research about depleted uranium. The subject line of the 

Pentagon paper read: "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0808-07.htm">Effects 

of Bombing on Disease Occurrence in Baghdad</a>." 

<P> Its analysis, as Nagy said, was blunt: "Increased incidence of diseases will 

be attributable to degradation of normal preventive medicine, waste disposal, 

water purification-distribution, electricity and decreased ability to control 

disease outbreaks." 

<P> "Imagine if the document had read, 'U.S. Water Treatment Vulnerabilities,' 

" and it described in detail how to spread epidemic to the U.S. civilian population. 

"It would be called terrorism," Nagy said. "Or worse. Genocide." 

<P> The Pentagon, meanwhile, dismissed the document. Defense Intelligence Agency 

spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Jim Brooks called it an assessment written for U.S. policy-makers 

but said he didn't know who had requested it or for what purpose. 

<P> "If you have this report, the best thing to do is to then look at what policies 

went into place. ... There are no sanctions that prevent (Saddam) from sustaining 

the water-treatment program" and caring for his people, Brooks said. 

<P> But Saddam has delivered on his part of the U.N. oil-for-food program, according 

to the United Nations, which has 158 observers in Iraq monitoring the movement 

of supplies. Since the relief effort began in 1997, he has never been cited for 

diverting or hoarding supplies, said program spokeswoman Hasmik Egian. 

<P> Meanwhile, Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, complained in the spring of 2000 about 

U.S. efforts to block crucial water and sanitation supplies. Following a five-day 

tour of hospitals, schools, clinics and water-treatment plants from Baghdad to 

Babylon, Hall wrote to then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: "Holds on contracts 

for the water and sanitation sector are a prime reason for the increases in sickness 

and death." 

<P> Hall cited 19 supply contracts for dual-use items such as water-purification 

chemicals, chlorinators, chemical dosing pumps and water tankers, and said the 

United States was responsible for blocking 18 of them. 

<P> When Albright was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1996, Lesley Stahl 

of CBS' news program "60 Minutes" asked her about the sanctions and the deaths 

of Iraqi children. 

<P> Albright said it was America's responsibility to make sure the Gulf War did 

not have to be fought again. "I think it is a very hard choice," she told Stahl. 

"But the price, we think the price is worth it." 

<P> U.S. Air Force Col. John Warden, who devised the Desert Storm Air Campaign's 

pinpoint strategy in 1991, said he had never heard of the Defense Intelligence 

Agency document outlining Iraq's water-treatment vulnerabilities. 

<P> He regrets the death of children, he said, but the United States is not to 

blame: "It bothers me from the standpoint that here is an evil guy ... who was 

willing to stand around and see that kind of thing happen. If you put someone 

in a hopeless position and keep grinding your heel into them, that is one thing. 

But we did not do that. The blame 100 percent goes to a guy named Saddam Hussein." 

<P> Warden, now retired and living in Georgia, believes another strike at Iraq 

would &#151; or should &#151; follow his Gulf War blueprint. 

<P> "When we went to war, our objective was to reduce Iraq's capability to be 

strategic," he said. "In order to make that happen, the last thing you want to 

do is focus your efforts solely on the military &#151; that is where you get your 

least results. ... We shut down the electrical system within the first hours of 

war. ... We shut down the internal flow of oil by knocking out the refineries. 

We also knocked out the communications. 

<P> "In my view, it was extraordinarily successful. ... Wars are devastating on 

civilians. Always have been."
