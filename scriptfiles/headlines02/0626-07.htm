</table></font>BERLIN   - 

U.S. tennis great Martina Navratilova

criticized her adopted homeland in a German newspaper on

Wednesday, saying money is the only thing that matters there.

<p>

Navratilova, a Czech-born American who won 18 grand slam singles titles when she 

dominated women's tennis in the late 1970s and 1980s, also wrote in an article 

for Die Zeit weekly that she believed free speech was being suppressed in the 

United States. 

<p>

"The most absurd part of my escape from the unjust system

is that I have exchanged one system that suppresses free

opinion for another," said Navratilova, 45, who fled

Czechoslovakia at the age of 18 to go to the United States.

<p> The nine-time women's Wimbledon champion, who still plays in some doubles 

tournaments and last week played in a singles tournament at the Eastbourne International 

Championships in England, singled out President Bush's Republican Party for unusually 

harsh criticism. 

<p>

"The Republicans in the United States manipulate public

opinion and sweep any controversial issues under the table,"

Navratilova said.

<p>

"It's depressing. Decisions in America are based solely on

the question of 'how much money will come out of it' and not on

the questions of how much health, morals or the environment

suffer as a result."

<p>

Navratilova, who is openly homosexual, said she fights

actively for gay rights.
