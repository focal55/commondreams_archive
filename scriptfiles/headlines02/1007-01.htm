<p>As U.S. House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt stepped away from the crowd 

Sunday in Kennedy Park, the crowd followed.</p>

<p> It was not the crowd that showed up to support Democrat Mike Michaud in his 

run for the House, it was the crowd unhappy with members of Congress, especially 

Gephardt.</p>

<p> “Gephardt, Gephardt has no spine! He just follows Bush’s line,” the crowd 

loudly repeated, holding signs and banging drums, standing a few feet away from 

the high-ranking Democrat. The age of protesters ranged from college students 

to middle-aged parents to white-haired seniors.</p>

The protesters were angry that Gephardt and other congressional leaders signed 

off on a resolution giving Bush the authority to use military action against Iraq. 

That resolution is expected to be taken up in Congress this week.</p>

<p> As Gephardt began to take questions from the news media following the rally, 

Michaud supporters stood between the protesters so reporters could hear what Gephardt 

said. Security was intense, but the event was peaceful and no arrests were made.</p>

<p> When asked for his position on the resolution, Gephardt said military action 

against Iraq must include the United Nations, but that he supports action against 

Iraq.</p>

<p> Debate on the resolution will begin this week, he said. “I felt we need to 

encourage the president to use the United Nations. I think he’s doing that. But 

we’ve got to deal with the problem we face with Iraq,” Gephardt said. “We have 

terrorists and terrorism in the world. We can’t allow that to affect us here in 

the United States. We’ve got to make sure that weapons of mass destruction are 

not used in the United States. We have a high responsibility to make sure that 

doesn’t happen.”</p>

<p> Democrats want Bush “to go to the Security Council and settle this through 

the Security Council,” Gephardt said. “We’ve got to use the United Nations. We’re 

a leader of the United Nations. We set it up. So we’ve got to try to stick with 

it.”</p>

<p> Protesters angrily said agreeing to the resolution is not how Democrats should 

behave.</p>

<p> “Things that are central to many of us in the Democratic Party, he just signed 

off on it,” Chuck Lidz said of Gephardt before the rally. “He’s put a lot of pressure 

on fellow Democrats who tried to raise questions about the war. In Democratic 

Party politics we try to do things internationally, with the cooperation of our 

allies. Bush is not doing that, and Gephardt just signed off on that.”</p>

<p> Bates sophomore Nathan Harrington agreed. “They’re supposed to be the opposition 

party but they don’t oppose,” he said.</p>

<p> “If Bush can convince the entire Security Council that this is the right policy, 

I will shut up,” Lidz said. “I don’t think I’ll agree, but I’ll shut up.” Lidz, 

of Hebron held a sign that read: “Who wants war in Iraq?”</p>

<p> “I want the Democrats to start questioning the insanity of a pre-emptive, 

unilateral invasion of a foreign country,” Harrington said, holding a sign that 

read “no more killing.” “Clearly Saddam Hussein’s regime is a terrible one.” But 

the sanctions have strengthened Hussein’s hold on power and caused suffering to 

the Iraqi people, Harrington said. “An invasion at this point will do the same 

thing.”</p>

<p> Security was tight during Sunday’s rally-protest with numerous Secret Service 

agents, state and local police officers at the scene. While no arrests were made, 

things got tense for a few seconds when a protester rushed toward Gephardt while 

taking something out of his bag, said Lewiston Police Lt. Jim Perkins. Fearing 

it could be a gun or another weapon, officers stopped the man and inspected his 

bag. “It was a camera,” Perkins said, adding the protester understood why he was 

stopped.</p>
