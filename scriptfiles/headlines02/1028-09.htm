<p>TOKYO -- The awful fireball that engulfed Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, introducing the atomic age with a mushroom cloud, has for decades propelled the leaders of that southern Japanese city to preach against nuclear weapons.</p><p> Hiroshima's current mayor has taken the role a step further. At his annual speech at the anniversary of the bombing, Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba made international headlines with his biting criticism of American foreign policy and, by implication, its war on terrorism.</p><p> "The United States government has no right to force 'Pax Americana' on us, or to unilaterally determine the fate of the world," Akiba declared. The speech has brought a torrent of reaction -- most of it positive, he says -- in Japan, and a chill from the United States.</p><p> Akiba is not your average home-grown Japanese mayor; he spent nearly 20 years in the United States, most of that time as a mathematics professor at Tufts University.</p><p> "I am not anti-American," he insists. "I am basically sort of an American democracy believer. I am spreading the American message from Hiroshima."</p><p> Akiba recently described his circuitous route to become the representative and chief torchbearer for the city that itself symbolizes the horrors of nuclear war. </p><p> It is a role he wears with some discomfort. His sharp critique of America is uncharacteristic of Japan's polite society, and despite the support for his remarks, the mayor says he has felt the weight of disapproval from some countrymen. </p><p> "I didn't realize that the pressure not to criticize America was so strong," he acknowledges. "In Japanese society, where restraining oneself is a virtue, there is a strong tendency to restrain from criticizing the United States." </p><p> So he is a bit defensive, even snappish: "I did not criticize the United States. I simply stated the facts," he insists. He does not back away from the view. "Nobody <em>has</em> given the United States the right to determine the fate of the world unilaterally. Those are facts."</p><p> Akiba is on more practiced ground dealing with the question of whether his city's tragic history gives him a certain moral authority, and with the inevitable issue of moral equivalency between Japan's wartime aggression leading to Pearl Harbor and America's use of such destructive force on two cities of civilians. </p><p> His remarks "could be interpreted as holier-than-thou," he acknowledges. "I'm not taking that attitude. But I am focusing on the recognition factor. The name Hiroshima is known by many people.</p><p> "In the world at large, there hasn't been a very strong awareness of what the Hiroshima and Nagasaki experience actually means to the world. What I am talking about is the meaning of the lives of the people who had the experience," he says. "I feel it is my duty as mayor of Hiroshima to represent those voices." </p><p> Akiba counts one of his first experiences the memory, as a 3-year-old, of the Allies' incendiary bombing of Tokyo, where he was born, in the final year of World War II. "It was terrifying but beautiful at night. I remember that."</p><p> When he reached high school, he went to the United States as a 17-year-old high school exchange student. Japan's own treatment of the war was to try to put the experience behind it quickly, with little pause to ponder blame. The approach has fostered a strain of victimization about the war, and particularly about the atomic bombings. Even today, small children in Japan are shown frightening movies depicting the Americans bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with no explanation of the context. Akiba says he found the reverse of that in America.</p><p> The attitude he found in America was that "the A-bomb was something God gave the Americans and the evil Japanese were punished justly by the nuclear weapons. It was quite a shock to me."</p><p> But he was not deterred from pursuing an academic career in the United States. He got his doctoral degree in mathematics at MIT in 1970 and began teaching at Tufts. He got married, and had a son in Boston in 1976, which he says started him "thinking about the future."  His activism was born then, too.</p><p> "Just about that time, I heard on Boston radio a call-in show on whether the atomic bombing was right or wrong. Naturally, 90 percent of the callers said it was right.</p><p> "I had heard that before. But Boston? Places like Cambridge and Berkeley were supposed to be liberal cities with peaceniks. I was reminded again of the general tenor of the American society. I thought, for the future, to make sound judgments, at least they should know the facts."</p><p> On the summer breaks from the university, he began organizing trips for journalists to Hiroshima. For 10 years he accompanied them and acted as interpreter, hearing time and again the wrenching stories of the bombing survivors sought out by  reporters.</p><p> But his frustration grew at the limits of that anecdotal approach. The academic in him felt there was no systematic effort to chronicle the Hiroshima story for history in a way, for example, that could be taught in a university course. Finally, in 1987, he concluded it was time to "write a book or two" about the subject, and he quit his job, left his family in the States and moved to Hiroshima. </p><p> He never wrote the books. He found himself detoured by a wave of a political revolt sweeping incumbents out of office, and in 1989 he was drafted by the Japanese socialist party to run for the Diet, Japan's national parliament.</p><p> "I'm not a socialist by ideology. Because of my education, I am a democrat. I believe in American democracy, and principles of the Declaration of Independence, and independence, and of Lincoln and Kennedy. I tried to change the Japanese national political scene somewhat, but it really didn't work out very well."</p><p> He spent 10 years in the Diet, an opposition member and critic of the ruling establishment that had survived the reformist wave and still controls the national government. When the previous mayor of Hiroshima stepped down, a frustrated Akiba quit the Diet -- and the socialist party -- to run and win in 1999.</p><p> Akiba says his job is concerned  with the usual issues of a mayor of a city of 1.1 million, mainly how to boost its flagging economy.  But he acknowledges that because of the bombing, which took a toll of 140,000 residents in 1945,  and  has since claimed 227,000,  by the city's count -- "I am capable of talking to the rest of the world."</p><p> And if that conversation is critical of American supremacy in the world, and its use of military might, so be it.</p><p> "Hiroshima's primary concern is nuclear weapons. But the weapons are not used in a vacuum," he says. "Typically they are used in a war. So any statement about nuclear weapons has implications about war."</p><p> "What Hiroshima survivors are advocating is that no one else should go through this experience. Such an experience should be understood as a living Hell, where the living envy the dead. That precludes the concept of retaliation," he says. </p><p> A laudable goal, but what is the lesson for a modern world, particularly for America as it grapples with how to respond to the attack of Sept. 11?</p><p> "That's a rhetorical question that should go both ways. Instead of considering the U.S. as the center and asking someone to wear your shoes, the world is asking the Americans to wear their shoes," he says. The implication of the U.S. view "is that everyone should think like Americans. No decisions of that kind in the international arena should be left to the strongest, doing whatever that country pleases.</p><p> "When you are saying Saddam Hussein is a threat, and [debating] whether to bomb Iraq, you are basing your argument on the assumption that Saddam Hussein killed 3,000 people" at the Pentagon and World Trade Center, he says. "That's a big supposition."</p><p> As a legislator in 1991, Akiba traveled to Baghdad to help negotiate the release of three Japanese hostages taken by  Hussein. It was an approach that should be used more, he contends.</p><p> "We didn't believe Saddam Hussein was a peace-loving leader. But our option was to seek every possible means, and we did succeed in negotiating with him," Akiba says. "I am proposing that we should seek all possible means, especially through the United Nations. Peaceful negotiations and other means have not been exhausted."</p><p> Is there any circumstance, he is asked, in which armed intervention is justified? Akiba pauses. There are limits to the license of his city's history, he concludes.</p>

<p> "Hiroshima is recognized worldwide because of the suffering Hiroshima has 

experienced," the mayor says. "We are not recognized because we know the answers 

to all these questions."</p>
