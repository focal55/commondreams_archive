WASHINGTON, April 17 — A study prepared by a private contractor estimates that 

pollution from more than 80 power plants owned by eight electric utilities will 

cause nearly 6,000 premature deaths in the year 2007. The number is lower than 

the estimated number of deaths by pollution now because the air is getting cleaner, 

but the utility industry still cast doubt on the study's credibility. 

<P> The study was conducted by Abt Associates Inc., a technical consulting firm 

based in Cambridge, Mass. Abt often conducts studies for the Environmental Protection 

Agency, but this report was prepared for the Rockefeller Family Fund, which among 

other work supports environmental projects.</p>

<P> It uses epidemiological studies to project the number of pollution-related 

deaths in 2007, after some important new clean-air regulations will have taken 

effect and presumably reduced the level of emissions.</p>

<P> The study arrived at its premature death figures by determining the number 

of deaths among people 30 and older in excess of a region's expected mortality 

levels.</p>

<P> The analysis estimates that in addition to the 6,000 deaths, pollutants from 

the eight utilities will lead to 140,000 asthma attacks and 14,000 cases of acute 

bronchitis in 2007.</p>

<P> The study says that this pollution consists of fine particles of substances 

like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory ailments, 

including lung cancer. The pollution drifts across the country with prevailing 

winds but falls relatively near home. Thus, plants in Ohio, Kentucky and Georgia, 

which have traditionally been blamed for acid rain and other pollutants in the 

Northeast, are also hurting residents in their own states.</p>

<P> "You don't have to go up to New England before you start to see the health 

damage," said Eric V. Schaeffer, the former chief enforcement officer for the 

Environmental Protection Agency and now an adviser to the Rockefeller fund.</p>

<P> Quinn Shea, executive director of environment for the Edison Electric Institute, 

an industry group, questioned the accuracy of the report.</p>

<P> "Regarding adverse health effects, we take that claim very seriously," Mr. 

Shea said. "But, given our experience with these authors, with their data base, 

with their modeling methodology, we have strong suspicions that this work is not 

credible."</p>

<P> The report is the latest piece of evidence to be introduced into the ongoing 

public debate over clean air regulations under review by the Bush administration. 

The administration wants to eliminate some programs and replace them with a strategy 

called Clear Skies, which, officials say, will reduce pollutants more than the 

current programs. Environmentalists strongly dispute this.</p>

<P> The eight companies in the study were: American Electric Power, based in Columbus, 

Ohio; Cinergy, in Cincinnati; Duke Power in Charlotte, N.C.; Dynegy, based in 

Houston; First Energy in Akron, Ohio; Sigeco in Indiana; Southern Company in Atlanta, 

and the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, which operate a combined 83 power 

plants. They account for about 8 percent of the more than 9,350 power plants in 

the country. All eight companies have been cited by the Justice Department as 

being in violation of the Clean Air Act and are in various stages of legal action.</p>

<P> The study said the companies that caused the most pollution were, not surprisingly, 

the biggest — American Electric Power, with 1,400 projected deaths, and the Southern 

Company, with 1,200 deaths.</p>

<P> Mike Tyndall, a spokesman for Southern, said the report used selective data 

that did not provide a complete picture of the situation. "It ignores dozens of 

other peer-reviewed studies that find no association between sulfates from power 

plants and health effects," Mr. Tyndall said.</p>

<P> The most deaths, 550, are in Pennsylvania.</p>

<P> "The big loser is Pennsylvania, because they're in the wind path," Mr. Schaeffer 

said.</p>

<P> New York can expect 340 deaths the report said, New Jersey 180 and Connecticut 

54.</p>
