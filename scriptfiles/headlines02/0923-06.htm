<p>SAN FRANCISCO  - Former vice president Al Gore sharply challenged President Bush on Iraq this 

afternoon, warning that the administration's apparent determination to launch 

military action to dislodge President Saddam Hussein will "seriously damage" 

efforts to win the war on terrorism and "weaken our ability to lead the 

world."



<p>In the most forceful critique of the administration by any leading Democrat, 

Gore challenged the administration's new doctrine of preemption, gave voice 

to critics who question the political timing of the administration's push for 

action in Congress and the United Nations and argued that Bush has shifted 

focus toward Iraq because the hunt for Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda 

terrorists has bogged down.



<p>Gore's critique, delivered before the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco, put 

him at odds with most of the other possible 2004 Democratic presidential 

candidates, who have been generally to strongly supportive of Bush on Iraq. A 

text of the speech was made available in Washington.



<p>Gore, who last winter said the war on terrorism would require "a final 

reckoning" with Saddam Hussein, restated his belief that the Iraqi leader is 

a potential menace to the world. But he argued that even if the United States 

has the theoretical right to move unilaterally against Iraq, such a course 

could have disastrous consequences for America's standing in the world.



<p>"I am deeply concerned that the policy we are presently following with 

respect to Iraq has the potential to seriously damage our ability to win the 

war against terrorism and to weaken our ability to lead the world in this new 

century," he said.



<p>Gore said the war on terrorism requires a multilateral coalition that likely 

would be shattered by anything approaching unilateral action against Iraq. He 

also chided the administration for trying to start a new war without 

finishing the job of hunting down those responsible for the attacks of last 

Sept. 11 or of stabilizing a post-Taliban Afghanistan.



<p>"I do not believe we should allow ourselves to be distracted from this urgent 

task simply because it is proving to be more difficult and lengthy than 

predicted," he said. "Great nations persevere and then prevail. They do not 

jump from one unfinished task to another."



<p>Gore said Hussein "does pose a serious threat" to stability in the Persian 

Gulf and urged the administration to take the time to assemble an 

international coalition, much as Bush's father did before launching a war 

against Iraq in 1991. Whatever good will the United States created in the 

wake of the Sept. 11 attacks has been put in jeopardy by the administration's 

concentration on Iraq, he added.



<p>Noting that in 1991 he voted for the resolution authorizing Bush's father to 

wage war {ndash} one of a handful of Democrats in the Senate to do so, Gore 

argued that current UN resolutions are enough to justify action against 

Hussein for being in violation of those resolution. But he said the 

administration's saber rattling and talk of preemption and acting without 

broad international support is the wrong course.



<p>Gore urged Congress to narrow the scope of the draft resolution Bush 

submitted last week and said lawmakers should also ask Bush to explain why 

unilateral action is justified, to seek more support from the United Nations 

and to outline in more detail what its post-Hussein plans are for 

reconstruction and stability in Iraq.



<p>On the doctrine of preemption, Gore said the danger is that other nations 

will assume the same right as that asserted by the administration, and that 

the "rule of law will quickly be replaced by the reign of fear."
