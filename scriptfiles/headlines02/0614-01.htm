<p> RAMALLAH, West Bank - The chief Palestinian negotiator said on Friday that 

a promised U.S. proposal to create a Palestinian state must also set a deadline 

for ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p> 

<p>President Bush vowed on Thursday to lay out a plan for  Palestinian statehood, but has yet to provide enough details to  dispel uncertainty over American policy in the region.</p>

							<p>Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat demanded that Bush set a  timetable for reaching a clearly defined goal, which should be  creation of a state in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

							<p>"What is needed from the U.S. administration is to specify  a mechanism and to specify a timeline that will end the Israeli  occupation," Erekat told Reuters.</p>

							<p>Israel's army said its troops shot dead a Palestinian man  after he stabbed and slightly wounded a Jewish settler at a gas  station in Kedumim, a West Bank settlement. Palestinian medics  said they saw no weapon near the body.</p>

							<p>Bush is preparing to unveil, probably next week, a  framework for renewed negotiations. The idea is to take Bush's  principles to a Middle East conference attended by cabinet  ministers in the hope of getting the parties to agree on the  path ahead.</p>

							<p>"We must build the institutions necessary for the evolution  of a Palestinian state which can live peacefully in the region  and provide hope for the suffering Palestinian people," Bush  said on Thursday.</p>

							<p>ISRAELI RAIDS</p>

							<p>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon opposes any discussion  of Palestinian statehood before an end to violence and sweeping  reform of President Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</p>

							<p>As both sides awaited Bush's proposals, Israeli forces  raided two Palestinian-ruled areas overnight, hours after  Arafat convened his new cabinet for the first time, calling for  an end to violence and promising to set dates for elections.</p>

							<p>In the latest of Israel's almost daily incursions, the army  said it destroyed a bomb workshop and detained three people in  the divided West Bank city of Hebron. Troops detained three  more people in a raid on the town of Bir Zeit near Ramallah.</p>

							<p>The Palestinian cabinet met in Ramallah after Israel ended  a three-day siege of Arafat's presidential compound there,  which prevented the session from taking place earlier in the  week.</p>

							<p>The Palestinian leader pared down his cabinet to 21  ministers on Sunday and has promised to streamline his security  services as part of reforms demanded by the United States and  Israel as well as many Palestinian parliamentarians.</p>

							<p>"The municipal elections will be held as soon as possible  and legislative and presidential elections will be held in  either December or January," Arafat said, adding that precise  dates would be set in the next few days.</p>

							<p>ISRAEL SEEKS CHANGE</p>

							<p>"We should give the path of the peace of the brave...the  chance it deserves for the security and the peace of the  Israeli people and the Palestinian people and the rest of the  region's people," the veteran former guerrilla chief said.</p>

							<p>Israel received Arafat's remarks coolly, demanding actions  not words to rein in militants behind attacks on Israelis.</p>

							<p>"Under Arafat the Palestinian Authority has become a  terror-endorsing authority and this is why we need to see a  real change," Israeli cabinet minister Danny Naveh told Reuters  Television.</p>

							<p>The Israeli army has kept up a campaign of rolling raids  into Palestinian-ruled areas with the declared aim of rooting  out militants.</p>

							<p>In a grim new twist, police said they were probing an  Israeli gambling ring in the southern town of Kiryat Malachi  suspected of betting on where the next suicide bombing would  take place.</p>

							<p>A Tel Aviv weekly which reported on the scheme said  Jerusalem's odds were the shortest at 3-2. Israeli law  prohibits gambling, but gaming thrives in illegal hideouts.</p>

							<p>At least 1,396 Palestinians and 509 Israelis have been  killed since the Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation  began in September 2000 after peace talks stalled.</p>
