<p>WASHINGTON - <font face=arial,helvetica size=-1> Religious leaders began another 

phase of an anti-war lobbying effort on Capitol Hill Wednesday, urging Congress 

to explore peaceful alternatives in its dealings with Iraq. </font> 

<p>"I'm appalled by it all," said Frances Kane, 64, of Washington. "I can't believe 

our country is seriously considering a pre-emptive strike without international 

support."

Betty Hutchinson,83, of Sandy Spring, Md., protests outside the Capitol, against 

a U.S. strike on Iraq, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2002, in Washington. The small peace 

protest featured speakers who attacked Democrats and Republicans who support a 

resolution to use military force against Iraq, which is being debated in the Congress.

</table></font>Congress is preparing to vote on a resolution giving the president broad authority 

to use military force to dismantle Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. 

On Capital Hill, about 100 nuns, lay people and other Catholics dropped off packets 

and held meetings with congressional staff, outlining their anti-war stance. 

<p> Others held silent vigils outside Senate and House buildings. 

<p> "Violence isn't the answer to anything," said Sister Mary Ann Smith, of Ossining, 

N.Y, on her way to the office of Rep. Sue Kelly, R-N.Y. "War is morally and ethically 

wrong." 

<p> While Wednesday's events were sponsored by various Catholic groups, including 

the lobbying group, NETWORK, Leadership Conference of Women Religious and Pax 

Christi, the National Council of Churches &#151; made up of 36-member denominations 

&#151; also planned events for this week. 

<p> The groups oppose resolutions to authorize the use of U.S. armed forces against 

Iraq. Instead, they're urging the United States to cooperate with the United Nations 

Security Council in returning weapons inspectors to Iraq. 

<p> "What kind of a democracy do we have when people are saying 'no war,' but 

representatives are about to vote for a war resolution?" said Andrea Buffa, community 

organizer for Global Exchange, a human rights group in San Francisco. "Congress 

isn't listening so people are coming to Washington to make sure they're heard." 

<p> Global Exchange, along with Peace Action in Washington, D.C. and American 

Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia, held a protest Wednesday evening. 

<p> Chanting, "War on Iraq, we say no!" about 200 protesters held banners with 

anti-war slogans and sounded off bells, drums and whistles outside Senate office 

buildings. 

<p> "We don't need a war, we need the U.N. to take the lead, not the U.S.," said 

Phyllis Bennis of the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies. "We are not 

better than the rest of the world. We don't have the right to say we're above 

international law." 

<p> "I'm horrified our president would consider a pre-emptive strike as a way 

to peace," said Sister Anne Marie Gardiner, 59, of Silver Spring, Md. "That's 

outrageous. It's a corruption of what the U.S. has tried to stand for." </p>
