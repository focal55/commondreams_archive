<p>NEW YORK - Widespread use of antipersonnel land mines in nations such as India 

and Pakistan is hampering global efforts to eliminate these weapons that kill 

or maim thousands of people annually, according to a report released on Friday 

by activists seeking a mine ban.

<p>Since late December 2001, during a period when India and  Pakistan moved to the brink of war, the two nuclear-armed  neighbors have laid large numbers of antipersonnel mines along  their common border, the International Campaign to Ban Land  mines said in its report.<p>The report also cited extensive use of land mines by the  governments of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and Russia, in  Chechnya, and on a smaller scale in Nepal, Somalia and the  former Soviet republic of Georgia.

<p>"A few holdout governments are undercutting the progress of all the rest," 

said Stephen Goose of <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human Rights 

Watch</a>, the lobby group that was a founding member of the campaign.

<p>The International Campaign to Ban Land mines is a global  network of more than 1,200 non-governmental organizations in 60  countries seeking to eliminate land mines and promote the 1997  Mine Ban Treaty.<p>"Three quarters of the countries in the world have  renounced the antipersonnel mine, and together they need to  bring more pressure on the recalcitrant few," Goose added in a  statement.<p>Groups in at least 14 countries used land mines last year,  including the Northern Alliance, the al Qaeda guerrilla network  and the toppled Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the report  found.<p>The report added that the United States did not use mines  in Afghanistan, and that many devices manufactured in Iran were  found in Afghanistan, apparently provided by the Iranian  government to combatants in the region.<p>The Mine Ban Treaty prohibits the use, production,  stockpiling and transfer of antipersonnel mines. Some 125  countries have signed and ratified the treaty, while another 18  have signed but not yet ratified it.<p>Some of the countries with the world's biggest militaries  -- including the United States, Russia, India, Pakistan, China  and Israel -- remain outside the treaty.<p>The International Campaign to Ban Land mines says the  weapons pose a daily threat in Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia,  Cambodia, Chechnya, Croatia, Iraq, Mozambique, Nicaragua,  Somalia and dozens of other places.<p>The United Nations estimates that about 10,000 people  worldwide are killed annually by land mines, and activists said  up to another 10,000 people are injured by the devices, often  requiring the amputation of limbs.<p>Up to 40 percent of all mine victims are children under age  15, according to the United Nations.</span>
