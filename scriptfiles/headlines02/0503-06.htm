<p>Journalists and freedom of the press took a severe beating in 2001 as murders and harassment increased, and the aftermath of September 11 closed many doors to reporters, say groups marking World Press Freedom Day on Friday.

<p>

The <a href="http://www.cpj.org/" target="_new">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) counted 37 deaths of journalists in 2001, 13 more than in 2000. Five murders have already taken place in 2002, including <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Daniel Pearl, abducted and killed in February while investigating Islamist extremism in Pakistan.

<p>







Last year 13 journalists died covering conflict areas such as the Middle East, Colombia, and Afghanistan, the top three "worst places to be a journalist, " according to a CPJ update released on May 3, World Press Freedom Day.

<p>







"On every continent," said France-based Reporters Without Borders, or Reporters Sans Fronti&#232;res (RSF), in its 2002 annual report published Friday, the basic right to a free press, "was harshly attacked, along with those who exercised it."

<p>









One journalist who has stood firm against such attacks is Geoffrey Nyarota, the publisher of an opposition daily in Zimbabwe, where restrictions on press freedom have grown harsher in recent months.

<p>









The offices of Nyarota's <i>Daily News </i> were bombed twice in the last two years, and he has received death threats. Nyarota could also face a jail sentence, having been charged with publishing articles on corruption and human rights abuses that allegedly violate Zimbabwe's new media laws.

<p>







Nyarota "has put his newspaper at the forefront of the battle to keep an independent and critical press alive in Zimbabwe," said the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which honored him with the World Press Freedom Prize at a two-day forum in the Philippines commemorating World Press Freedom Day.

<p>







Focusing on "Terrorism and Media," media professionals at the conference in Manila, held May 1-2, examined how journalism has fared in the post-September 11 environment.

<p>









Eleven countries, including the United States, have adopted or are considering laws to clamp down on the media since September 11, said UNESCO in a press release earlier this week.

<p>







Also of concern, according to UNESCO, is the climate of insecurity prevailing since the attacks, which has given some governments an excuse to turn away reporters seeking information that was formerly considered public, restrict privacy on the Internet, and install wiretaps with fewer safeguards for individual privacy.

<p>







"Countries like Zimbabwe, Nepal, and Eritrea have appropriated the rhetoric of the war on terrorism to crack down on internal dissent, including opposition media," said Joel Simon, Deputy Director of CPJ.

<p>







"The government of Eritrea arrested 13 journalists immediately after September 11. They seem to think that with the world focusing elsewhere, no one will pay attention," he added.

<p>







According to Internews President David Hoffman, government efforts to suppress information are being beaten back by many new technologies that help people communicate.

<p>







Despite government attempts to limit Internet use in China and India, usage is increasing exponentially, and in Rwanda video documentaries on war crimes are being shown in villages and prisons to help promote reconciliation, wrote Hoffman and Tara Sonenshine, a former ABC News Nightline producer, in an editorial last week published by the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>.

<p>







"Old media and new media are helping to turn on the lights in the darkest corners of the world. That is worth celebrating on World Press Freedom Day," the two journalists concluded.

<p>







World Press Freedom Day, May 3, was established in 1993 by the United Nations, on recommendation of UNESCO, to highlight the importance of a free and independent media.
