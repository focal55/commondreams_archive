BOGOTA, Colombia  --

The Cano Limon oil pipeline, which snakes almost 500 miles across 

northern Colombia, was once the focus of dreams for national prosperity.

<P>But after years of sabotage bombings by leftist guerrillas, the pipeline 

may serve instead as the trigger for wider U.S. involvement in Colombia's 36-

year civil war, some critics warn.

</table></font>Earlier this month, the Bush administration announced it will ask Congress 

for $98 million in the 2003 budget to train, arm and provide air support for 

Colombian troops to defend the pipeline, which is jointly owned by the 

Occidental Petroleum Corp., with headquarters in Los Angeles, and the 

Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol.

<P>The move marks a shift from previous U.S. policy of providing only military 

aid, which was reserved almost exclusively for anti-narcotics operations.

<P>U.S. officials say training a battalion of 1,000 men to guard a petroleum 

pipeline is not part of the war on terrorism but rather an effort to preserve 

Colombia's economy, which derives about one-third of its export earnings from 

oil.

<P>The pipeline is "important for the future of . . . our (U.S.) petroleum 

supplies and the confidence of our investors," said U.S. Ambassador Anne 

Patterson in a recent interview with the leading Bogota daily El Tiempo.

<P>Critics, including community leaders in towns alongside the pipeline and 

the guerrillas, say the shift will intensify the conflict in Colombia's oil-

rich northeast.

<P><b>'Counterinsurgency Plan'</b>

<P>"Plans for the United States to train an infrastructure protection 

battalion will make the conflict in this region more acute," said Samuel 

Morales, president of the Unitary Workers' Confederation in the town of 

Saravena. "The infrastructure issue is a pretext and this is a clear 

counterinsurgency plan."

<P>The pipeline began operation in 1986 and pumps around 110,000 barrels a day 

of crude oil from the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental in Arauca 

province on the border with Venezuela, to the Caribbean coastal town of 

Covenas.

<P>The 2-foot-diameter tube, buried for much of its length at depths of 6 feet,

 has been a favored target for Colombia's two largest leftist rebel forces, 

which accuse foreign multinational firms of "plundering" the nation's natural 

resources.

<P><b>Rebels Target Pipeline</b>

<P>Last year, guerrillas blew up sections of the pipeline 170 times, putting 

it out of operation for 266 days. This year it has been bombed 15 times 

already. Since 1986, there have been more than 900 such incidents and a loss 

of some 2.5 million barrels of crude -- more than nine times the amount of the 

Exxon Valdez spill.

<P>Although Cano Limon is an alternative source of oil for the United States, 

its total production hardly qualifies it to be considered strategically 

important.

<P>In 2001, Colombia produced 600,000 barrels a day and its exports accounted 

for less than 2 percent of total U.S. oil needs. Even within Occidental's 

worldwide portfolio, the Cano Limon field comprises less than 5 percent of its 

global production.

<P>But oil is essential to the health of Colombia's economy. The government 

estimated that last year's record bombing campaign against the pipeline shaved 

half a percentage point off the gross domestic product.

<P>The Cuban-inspired National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second-

largest rebel force, began its offensive against the pipeline even before it 

was built, demanding multimillion-dollar payoffs to allow the project to be 

completed ahead of schedule.

<P>More recently, the far larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 

has taken the lead in bombings, apparently in an effort to back its own hefty 

extortion demands.

<P>"We have been told to bomb at will and keep the pipeline out of action," 

said a FARC fighter, who gave his name only as Javier, outside a town close to 

the pipeline.

<P>Javier said he and his team, traveling on motorbikes or bicycles, plant 25-

pound bombs made of dynamite and a fertilizer mixture -- a low-tech device 

that is cheap to produce but extremely effective.

<P>In a 1993 document, the FARC leadership laid out its demands for state 

ownership and control of strategic economic sectors, including the oil 

industry, and asked that contracts with multinational companies be rescinded 

or renegotiated. The ELN maintains a similar stance.

<P>FARC commanders have predictably condemned the new U.S. proposal.

<P>"This is one of a series of measures to increase American involvement in 

Colombia's war," said Andres Paris, a member of the FARC negotiating team 

involved in peace talks with the government. "The best way of protecting oil 

is to develop and protect the state oil sector."

<P>Former U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette rejects such arguments. He believes 

Washington wants to broaden its focus beyond counter-narcotics to prop up the 

fragile central government, which has been unable to prevent the rebel armies 

from gaining control of about 40 percent of the country.

<P>"It's not exactly counterinsurgency," he said. "But either with or without 

American help, Colombia must extend the authority and presence of the state."

<P>Using troops to protect Colombia's energy infrastructure is nothing new. 

Between 10 percent and 15 percent of the army's total combat force is said to 

be deployed alongside oil pipelines and other key facilities.

<P>Foreign oil companies, including Occidental and BP-Amoco, make regular 

contributions for their own protection through donations to the Finance 

Ministry that are then channeled to the military.

<P>But as last year's surge in pipeline attacks demonstrates, their largesse 

has produced few results.</p>
