NEW DELHI, Jan 25 (IPS) - Governments concerned about nuclear

proliferation

should be more worried by the greater potential for mischief that

biotechnology holds in military and criminal minds, say members of

an

international panel of scientists involved in shaping the

Biosafety Protocol. 

<P>

   In India for a strategy session ahead of the <a href="http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/eng/index.asp" target="_new">Second World

Social Forum</a>

in Porte Alegre, Brazil next week, which will discuss alternatives

to

globalization, the experts said biotechnology weapon programs

now being

developed secretly by several governments are insidious.  

<P>

   They are more difficult to detect than programs for

developing nuclear

weapons, they added. 

<P>

   ''Biotechnology weapons come out of test tubes rather than the

large

conspicuous facilities that are needed for developing and

delivering

nuclear weapons,'' Christine von Wiezsacker, vice president of

Ecoropa, the

Green Movement of Europe told IPS. <P>

   And in the same way that nuclear technology was promoted as

having the

potential to solve supposed shortages of energy resources,

biotechnology is

now being touted by its proponents as the answer to mythical food

shortages, added Sue Edwards, biology professor at the Addis Ababa

University, Ethiopia. 

<P>

   Wiezsacker said there were too many ''gray areas'' in

biotechnology that

are being  exploited in the name of food security but are actually

detrimental to it. 

<P>

   A classic example is ''terminator'' technology, which renders

seeds

infertile in subsequent generations so that farmers are forced to

return to

the transnational firms to buy seeds rather than use what they

have stored,

as in traditional farming  <P>

   ''Terminator technology delivered from the outside could make

entire

countries dependent on TNCs for their seed requirements,''

Wieszacker said. <P>

   ''This is in fact a war on entire species at the cost of

monocultures

which are vulnerable to ecological breakdown and are

unsustainable,''

Edwards said. <P>

    Worst of all is the refusal of governments that are backed by

the same

TNCs to accept the international regulation of little-understood

areas of

biotechnology, notably genetic engineering, despite its potential

for mass

destruction, intended or otherwise, said Prof. Jean Grossholtz,

feminist

and global campaigner for cultural and biological diversity. 

<P>

   Grossholtz , who teaches at the Holyoke College in

Massachusetts in the

United States, said the U.S. government was taking advantage of

the Sep. 11

terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and the anthrax

scare, to

restrict the right of citizens to information about its biological

defense

program.

<P>

   She said the US government is clearly more interested in

defending the

interests of TNCs than in protecting citizens from biological

warfare, and

is now also moving away from commitments under the Biological and

Toxin

Weapons Convention (BTWC) not to develop or stockpile biological

weapons. 

<P>

   In fact, the United States has been accused of sabotaging the

fifth

convention of the BTWC at Geneva in December, where negotiations

were held

on for mandatory verification mechanisms for the international

inspection

of suspected biological weapons research and production

facilities.  

<P>

   Wiezsacker, Edwards and Grossholtz are part of Diverse Women

for

Diversity, a movement begun with the avowed aim of creating

diverse

solutions to economic globalization at the local level and

building a

coalition of women for a common defense against the process at a

global level. 

<P>

   They are being hosted in India by Vandana Shiva, a founder of

the

movement and director of the New Delhi-based, Research Foundation

for

Science, Technology and Ecology, which works on protecting

sustainable,

organic farming. 

<P>

   A self-declared nuclear-weapons state, India has been

vigorously

pursuing genetic engineering as a means to food security. This is

in spite

of a massive 50-million ton grain surplus amidst widespread

reports of

starvation deaths and chronic malnutrition among more than half of

its

billion plus population. 

<P>

   But thanks to a powerful political and bureaucratic elite that

dictates

policy in India, the country has a chain of state-run laboratories

and

facilities that have acknowledged capabilities in frontline areas

like

space, nuclear and missile technology as well as biotechnology. <P>

   In the midst of the global anthrax scare last year, the Indian

government's biotechnology laboratories showed off their prowess

by

announcing the development of a superior recombinant vaccine

against the

farmyard germ that has earned notoriety as a biological warfare

agent. 

<P>

   The experts said that India -- which is now firmly committed to

globalization after renouncing half-a-century of independent

development --

presented the classic example of how food shortages were caused by

poor

distribution mechanisms and government policies rather than low

agricultural output. 

<P>

   This month, India officially permitted the sale of genetically

engineered cotton seeds, although Shiva and other activists have

campaigned

against it for years. They have a petition pending in the Supreme

Court

seeking to restrain the government from letting in the technology

without

public debate. <P>

   But genetically engineered cotton has been freely available in

the

Indian seed market for at least three years now.  <P>

   Shiva and other activists believe that this is the result of

clandestine

testing carried out by the translation firm that developed the

seed by

splicing it with toxic genes from bacteria for pest resistance. <P>

   Shiva said no attempt was ever made to hold the U.S.-based

Monsanto

Corporation, which owns the patent for genetically engineered  

cotton, 

accountable at any time for tests that became controversial after 

volunteers took to physically uprooting the cotton plants in  

southern 

Karnataka state. <P>

   ''It is the responsibility of the government to hold those who  

own the 

patents on and distribute genetically modified crops liable for  

any 

ecological, social and economic consequences,'' Shiva said. <P>

   Another member of the movement, Ursula Oswald Spring, a former  

minister 

for environment from Mexico, noted that no attention was being  

paid to the 

fact that cotton seed was fed to cattle in India and that the  

toxic genes 

could easily spread through cross-pollination because most of  

India's 

farmers are small-holders. <P>

   Spring, who now teaches at the National University of Mexico,  

said she 

saw many similarities between the situation in her country and  

that in 

India especially in terms of the heated debates over the subject. <P>

   ''Mexico does not allow the planting of genetically engineered  

crops, 

but is forced to import them thanks to trade agreements. This  

poses the 

hazard of contamination 

 across species,''  she said adding that India now faces similar  

dangers. 

<P>

   Wiezsacker said that whatever the argument in favor of genetic 

engineering, the fact remains that insurance countries have  

refused to 

insure against mishaps arising from the release of genetically  

engineered 

organisms into the environment simply because of insufficient  

science.  

<P>

   ''Right now, even the question of who would be liable in the  

event of a 

catastrophe remains to be answered,'' she pointed out. </p>
