<p>STRASBOURG, France - The European Parliament has backed strict new European 

Union rules on tracking and labeling genetically modified crops and food and feed 

products made from them. 

<p> But Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) Wednesday went further than 

the changes advocated by the European Commission by voting to ban shipments of 

conventional food and feed containing accidental traces of genetically modified 

material that is not approved by the European Union. 

<p> The legislation given its parliamentary first reading today was presented 

by the Commission a year ago, introducing harmonized EU traceability and labeling 

for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Agreement on the rules is seen as crucial 

for the lifting of a de facto moratorium on gene crop approvals. 

<p> The traceability requirements are relatively uncontroversial and most debate 

has been over the labeling provisions. 

<p> Voting on an Environment Committee recommendation at its Strasbourg plenary 

session, the parliament backed the Commission's plan to require even refined products 

that no longer contain modified material to be labeled as derived from GMOs. They 

also endorsed labeling of GMO-derived animal feeds. Neither need be labeled currently. 

<p> But MEPs rejected the committee's proposal to require labeling of products 

from animals fed on GM feed, and also came down against labeling processing aids 

such as GM enzymes, again following the Commission's line. 

<p> In what could prove to be the central issue during the second reading of the 

proposals, MEPs threw out the Commission's plan to apply one percent tolerance 

thresholds for the accidental presence of genetically modified material in non-modified 

products. 

<p> The presence of genetically modified material approved elsewhere in the world 

but not in the EU should be banned entirely, they said, while the threshold for 

EU approved material should be lowered to 0.5 percent. 

<p> Biotechnology industry lobbyists were dismayed. "They [MEPs] don't seem to 

understand that the rest of the world is moving on and using this technology. 

We think the thresholds are simply unattainable," Simon Barber of Europabio told 

reporters. Food industry lobby CIAA expressed similar sentiments. 

<p> Anti-biotechnology campaigners were jubilant. Friends of the Earth called 

the vote a "major success for consumers and a serious defeat for the biotech industry 

and the U.S. government." 

<p> If adopted, the thresholds would force significant changes in American agricultural 

practices to access EU markets and the Bush administration has indicated it could 

take action through the World Trade Organization . 

<p> The U.S. mission in Brussels expressed disappointment with the vote. An official 

said, "Regrettably, the European parliament has chosen to ignore our repeated 

expressions of concern that the Commission's proposals were unworkable, costly 

and subject to fraud. The proposals will seriously impair trade in agricultural 

biotech products." 

<p> The Commission welcomed the backing for its labeling plans but said restricting 

the tolerance thresholds would "put significant obstacles in the way" of implementing 

the rules and "hamper" international trade.
