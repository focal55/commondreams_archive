<p>McDonald's has been accused of extreme insensitivity after releasing a new 

sandwich called the "McAfrika" in Norway, one of the world's richest countries, 

at a time when 12 million people are facing starvation in southern Africa.

</font>The launch of the new hamburger has infuriated the Norwegian equivalent 

of Christian Aid and the Norwegian Red Cross and generated a storm of bad publicity 

for the American fast-food giant. 

<P>The concoction of beef, cheese, tomatoes and salad in a pita-style sandwich 

is said to be based upon an authentic African recipe and is being sold to Norwegian 

consumers for about &#163;2.80 ($4.20 US). 

<P>But aid agencies trying to raise funds to stave off a famine in southern Africa 

say that the timing of the McAfrika marketing campaign is insensitive, crass and 

ill-considered and have demanded remedial action from McDonald's. 

<P>"It's inappropriate and distasteful to launch a hamburger called McAfrika when 

large portions of southern Africa are on the verge of starvation," Linn Aas-Hansen 

of Norwegian Church Aid told the newspaper Aftenposten. 

<P>Protesting members of the aid group have been doling out "catastrophe crackers" 

- the protein-rich biscuits given to starving people in Africa - to fast-food 

lovers outside the firm's restaurants in Oslo. 

<P>"Twelve million people are suffering from starvation in countries such as Malawi 

and Zimbabwe; it is one of the biggest humanitarian disasters we have ever seen. 

We have nothing against McDonald's but the timing of this is insensitive," said 

Gunstein Instesjord, a senior policy advisor at Norwegian Church Aid. 

<P>"McDonald's must see that the launch has not been successful." 

<P>Aware that it has a public relations embarrassment on its hands, McDonald's 

Norway has been quick to launch a damage limitation exercise, making conciliatory 

noises in the Norwegian media. 

<P>Margaret Brusletto, a spokeswoman for the company, said she was sorry the name 

of the product had offended many. 

<P>"That wasn't our intention," she told Aftenposten. "We acknowledge that we 

have chosen an unfortunate time to launch this new product." 

<P>Faced with mounting protest about the new McAfrika, she initially said the 

company would "consider" a request to share proceeds from its sales with aid agencies 

but a meeting with the Norwegian Red Cross and others produced no such agreement. 

<P>Nor has McDonald's agreed to withdraw the offending product from sale. 

<P>But it has offered to allow aid agencies to leave collection boxes and fundraising 

posters in its Norwegian restaurants - but only in those selling McAfrika burgers 

and only for as long as the "special promotional burger" remains on sale. 

<P>In a statement issued to the Guardian from its UK head office in East Finchley 

yesterday, McDonald's said: "All of the involved parties are happy with this solution. 

We hope this will put a wider focus on the important job that these organizations 

are doing, and McDonald's in Norway is pleased to be able to support this."</p>
