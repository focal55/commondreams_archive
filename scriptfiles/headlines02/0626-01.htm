<p>CORPORATE America suffered its biggest scandal to date last night when it was claimed that WorldCom, a telecommunications company founded by a devout Mississippi Christian, had lied about making about $3.85 billion (£2.6 billion) of profits over 15 months.

</table></font>The size of the alleged profits overstatement at WorldCom is more than double the previous record, set by the pharmacy chain Rite Aid, and makes the accounting irregularities at Enron Corporation look like a rounding error. WorldCom, already crippled by nearly $30 billion of debt, is now expected to go bust. 

<P>Brad Burns, a WorldCom spokesman, could not be reached for comment by <I>The Times</I> last night. The alleged WorldCom fraud comes amid a crisis of confidence in US capitalism, after a series of accounting scandals at Tyco International, Kmart, Enron and Global Crossing. 

<P>The accounting problems at WorldCom, described as a “massive fraud” by sources last night, were discovered during an internal investigation at the firm. WorldCom has fired its chief financial officer, Scott Sullivan. 

<P>Last night’s revelation is likely to result in questioning of Bernie Ebbers, WorldCom’s cowboy-booted founder and former chief executive, who was ousted in May. 

<P>Until yesterday, Mr Ebbers, 60, was most famous for giving himself a $366 million personal loan from WorldCom’s bank account. The loan, to cover some of Mr Ebbers’s share trading debts, caused widespread outrage on Wall Street. 

<P>The former WorldCom chief was one of Wall Street’s most charismatic chief executives. He still drives a tractor on his brother’s cattle ranch and takes Sunday school classes at a Baptist church in Mississippi. According to <I>The</I> <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, “it isn’t beneath him to occasionally castrate a bull”. 

<P>WorldCom’s auditing firm during the period of the accounting problems was Andersen, which was also Enron’s auditor. 

<P>It is thought that WorldCom exaggerated its profits by billions of dollars using a simple accounting trick: it booked many of its day-to-day expenses as capital expenditure. That meant that corporate expenses did not show up on its profit-and-loss account, making the firm appear far more profitable than it was.
