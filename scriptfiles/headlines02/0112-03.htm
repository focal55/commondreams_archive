LOS POZOS, Colombia   - Colombian FARC rebels

produced a last-minute proposal to save three-year-old peace

talks on the brink of a government deadline on Saturday and

said they were waiting for President Andres Pastrana to accept

or reject it.

<p>After two-days of intensive talks with U.N. envoy James

LeMoyne, the Marxist guerrillas said they sent Pastrana a

14-point blueprint they hoped would persuade him not to order

the army into a demilitarized enclave.

<p>``We are waiting for a decision by the president on the

future of the process of dialogue and negotiation,'' said a

statement released by weary-looking rebel commanders in the

dusty hamlet of Los Pozos in their southern safe haven.

</font>There was no immediate response from Pastrana, who on

Thursday gave LeMoyne until 9:30 p.m. EST to strike a deal with

the 17,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia --

known by the Spanish initials FARC.

<p>Pastrana had said that if he was not satisfied the rebels

were committed to the peace talks which have dragged on for

three years with little result then he would give them 48 hours

to get out of their enclave before sending troops after them.

<p>The rebel proposal seemed to address the president's main

complaint -- that the FARC must drop its insistence on relaxing

security controls around the Switzerland-sized territory he

granted them at the start of talks in late-1998.

<p>In an attempt to deal with the issue, which had paralyzed

talks for three months, the FARC proposed referring disputes

over roadblocks on the borders of their enclave to a special

commission.

<p>They rebels also said that discussion of a cease-fire

should begin straight away -- as Pastrana has insisted.

<p>Other rebel gripes, such as their objections to military

overflights and a government ban on foreigners entering their

territory, were dropped or toned down.

<p>An exhausted LeMoyne said he hoped that Colombia's

38-year-old war, which has claimed 40,000 lives in the past

decade alone, would not escalate.

<p>``I believe both the government and the FARC want peace. It

hasn't been easy. It's still not easy, but I'm still hopeful,''

he said, after the long two days of talks in tropical heat.

<p>The American former New York Times correspondent, who

covered wars in Latin America in the 1980s, called on both

sides to avoid provocative statements or actions.

<p>LeMoyne, who spent Friday night at a FARC base, was in

regular contact with Pastrana throughout the day.

<p>ORDINARY RESIDENTS FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES

<p>The 120,000 mainly poor Colombians who have lived under

FARC rule in this swathe of cattle country and jungle have been

anxiously awaiting the outcome of the last-ditch attempts to

save talks. Fearing for their lives, many local residents said

they would flee the region if negotiations collapsed.

<p>Thousands of troops and tanks have been massing near the

enclave in preparation for a long-planned strike on the rebel

stronghold. The army says FARC has used the enclave as a

massive prison for kidnapping victims and as a base for a

cocaine-trafficking business.

<p>Near Los Pozos, where the FARC has been hosting the peace

talks, residents said they feared brutal retaliation from the

army and outlawed right-wing paramilitary fighters -- who might

accuse residents of being rebel sympathizers -- if talks

collapse.

<p>``If the army gets here, so will the paramilitaries. They

will wipe out entire families, even grandmothers,'' said Joana,

25, as she listened to the news on a portable radio. Like other

local residents, she did not want her last name used.

<p>Joana, like others, said if talks failed she would abandon

the enclave for fear of her life and those of her three

children as the 38-year-old guerrilla war threatens to

escalate.

<p>The government has promised to guarantee the safety of the

civilian inhabitants of the demilitarized zone regardless of

what happens. Ordinary people complain that they were not

consulted when the FARC was ceded their territory and that they

are not being consulted now that it might be taken away.

<p>CAR BOMB INJURES 16 AS REBELS TALK

<p>As LeMoyne and the FARC commanders were meeting, a car bomb

exploded next to an army base in the town of Granada, about 30

miles north of the rebel enclave, injuring 16 people, one

seriously, a doctor at the local hospital told Reuters.

<p>It was not clear who planted the bomb, which went off close

to a base where government troops were concentrating in

preparation for the possible push into the FARC-held haven.

<p>Pastrana, who steps down in August, has dedicated his term

in office to striking a deal with the FARC. But he has come

under pressure to get tough with the rebels after failing to

win significant rebel concessions.

<p>If the army retakes the FARC-held land, the rebels are

expected to surrender their handful of scruffy towns and

disappear into thick jungle to wage irregular war.

<p>Most FARC members always have been based outside the zone.
