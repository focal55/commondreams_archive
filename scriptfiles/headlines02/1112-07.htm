Chile - Members of the international nongovernmental coalition <a href="http://www.speciessurvivalnetwork.org/" target="_new">Species 

Survival Network</a> were "shocked" to hear the United States offer a plan today 

that would allow for a renewed international commercial trade in stockpiled elephant 

ivory within the next three years. 

<p> The U.S. amendment language came without warning at the 12th conference of 

Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 

during debate over a proposal from Botswana to allow the trade in 20 metric tons 

of ivory and also allow for an annual quota for ivory sales. 

<p> The U.S. language was announced moments before the European Union announced 

its opposition to the ivory trade at this time.

The head of the United States delegation, Judge Craig Manson, admitted at a briefing 

this evening that the United States had not shared its amendment language with 

either the European Union, or the ivory trade proponent countries before offering 

it on the floor, said Adam Roberts, senior research associate for the Animal Welfare 

Institute, a Washington, DC based member organization of the Species Survival 

Network. 

<p> The newly articulated U.S. position comes as a surprise because on the second 

day of the CITES conference, November 4, Judge Manson said the United States "remains 

concerned regarding any resumption in this trade because of potential effects 

on elephant populations and ongoing monitoring efforts." 

<p> Judge Manson is assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks in the 

U.S. Department of the Interior. A former California Superior Court judge, he 

previously served as general counsel for the California Department of Fish and 

Game. 

<p> Judge Manson admitted to receiving 12,000 emails objecting to any relaxation 

in the ivory trade ban from concerned citizens in the last 48 hours. 

<p> "The United States continues to be strongly committed to African elephant 

conservation," he said on November 4. "Regardless of the decision reached by the 

160 nations that are part of CITES, ivory imports to the United States will continue 

to be prohibited under both the Endangered Species Act and the African Elephant 

Conservation Act." 

<p> Botswana is one of five African countries that has proposed at this CITES 

meeting to resume the international ivory trade. The other countries are South 

Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia. Together, all five countries have proposed 

to export 87 metric tons of stockpiled ivory, the tusks of about 11,000 elephants. 

<p> The countries also asked permission to export a total of 13 metric tons of 

ivory on an annual basis. 

<p> Each proposal is being considered separately at the CITES meeting. Botswana, 

the first to be considered, is seeking to export 20 metric tons of ivory at first 

and then four metric tons annually thereafter. Kenya and India are opposed to 

the resumption of the elephant ivory trade. They have proposed to the CITES meeting 

that all African elephant populations be listed on CITES Appendix I which prohibits 

international trade. 

<p> "Why on earth did the U.S. not share its language with the EU?" asked Will 

Travers, president of the Species Survival Network and CEO of the Born Free Foundation. 

He warns that the U.S. decision may undermine the European Union´s strong position 

against the ivory trade. 

<p> "An agreement could have been worked out that pleased all relevant Parties 

if the U.S. had not acted unilaterally. The EU clearly stated that the ivory trade 

should not resume before the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties to 

CITES in 2005 has agreed to this trade. The U.S. must incorporate this timing 

in its amendment language before it is voted upon tomorrow," Travers demanded. 

<p> Elephant conservationists fear that restarting the legal ivory would act as 

a mask for an illegal trade based on poached elephants that is already thriving. 

<p> Poaching has wiped out over 3,600 elephants in the last two years and customs 

officials around the world have intercepted at least 50 metric tons of illegal 

ivory in the same period, warns Susie Watts who chairs the Species Survival Network's 

Elephant Working Group. 

<p> African countries have agreed by consensus to the re-opening of ivory trade 

under strict regulations. The agreement was reached at a late October meeting 

of 24 of the 37 African elephant range states, that is the countries inhabited 

by elephants. 

<p> Kenya has entered a formal reservation to the African agreement on ivory trade 

announced at the African Elephant Range States Dialogue, questioning the process 

by which the compromise was achieved, and the role of the CITES Secretariat in 

leading the negotiations 

<p>The Kenya/India proposal was not discussed when negotiating a compromise despite 

the fact that a number of countries expressed support for the proposal, and India, 

a co-proponent on the Kenya proposal was not permitted to attend the meeting. 

<p> Kenya Wildlife Service Director Joseph Kioko objects to the renewed ivory 

trade because, he says, previous ivory quota systems devised by CITES failed to 

protect elephants because enormous and growing markets in the East had the capacity 

to consume more ivory than Africa could legally supply, resulting in enormous 

volumes of illegal ivory trafficking. 

<p> Under Appendix II, which permits trade under strict regulations, even with 

an ivory quota system, African elephants were predicted to decline to extinction 

within 10 years. Between 1979 and 1989, the African elephant population declined 

by 53 percent, Kioko points out. 

<p> By 1989, it was estimated that 90 percent of ivory in trade came from poached 

elephants. The 1989 CITES ivory trade ban is working, says Kioko, as evidenced 

by the fact that in the 10 years after the ban, the continental African elephant 

population was no longer in decline. 

<p> Many of the causes of the failure of the Appendix II listing and ivory quota 

system are still a threat to elephant populations today, Kioko warns. "These include 

poor regulations, corruption, access to arms, poor enforcement, no monitoring, 

and the existence of numerous loopholes." 

<p> Delegates to the CITES conference must vote on the elephant ivory trade issue 

in plenary session before the conference closes November 15. </p>
