<p>New moves by the Bush administration to lift regulations on logging companies 

and big industrial polluters have been denounced by environmentalists, who say 

an unprecedented assault is being made on 30 years of legislation protecting America's 

forests, water, air and seashores.</p>

<p>Two low-key announcements in the past week, apparently timed to minimize media 

coverage, have removed environment-friendly provisions from the Clean Air Act 

and from rules governing the management of specially designated national forests.</p>

<p>The White House has also given tacit approval to the incursion of oil prospectors 

and mining companies in a number of national parks. Oil and gas drilling has already 

started in one previously protected area, the Padre Island National Seashore in 

south-west Texas, and is likely to be approved soon in other parks in Ohio, Texas 

and Louisiana.</p>

<p>A congressional showdown is expected over the fate of the Arctic National Wildlife 

Refuge in Alaska, where unspoiled wilderness is vulnerable to energy exploitation 

because the Republicans control the House and Senate after this month's mid-term 

elections. Environmental lobby groups said yesterday the election victories appeared 

to have emboldened the President and revived ambitions to rewrite the environmental 

rule book.</p>

<p>Gregory Wetstone of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a Washington environmental 

lobby group, said of the latest measures: "Sadly, there is every reason to believe 

that this is just the leading edge of an assault on fundamental protections for 

our air, water and public health."</p>

<p>The first new announcement, made late last Friday, knocked out a central pillar 

of the Clean Air Act that forced companies to make additions to older factories 

to upgrade the level of protection against air pollution at the same time. The 

second announcement removed almost all federal oversight of forest management. 

Supervisors of the country's 155 national forests will now decide whether to authorize 

drilling, logging or mining, almost irrespective of legislation protecting wildlife 

species or old trees.</p>

<p>In many areas, environmentalists say, Forest Service officials are already 

beholden to powerful local industry forces and are likely to cave in to their 

interests. "They are pulling out the strongest single element in the law that 

assures that forests will be managed in a healthy manner," said Rodger Schlickeisen, 

president of Defenders of Wildlife.</p>

<p>When oil and gas exploration is the issue, decision-making power in many areas 

is already in the hands of local authorities. The federal government has the power 

to veto commercial exploitation, but the Bush administration chose not to exercise 

that power when approval was given this month to build two natural gas wells on 

the Padre Island National Seashore. Eighteen-wheeler trucks have since been rumbling 

right up to the sand dunes where a rare breed of turtle usually nests and hatches 

its young. What was once a 65-mile stretch of unspoiled barrier island &#150; 

the longest in the world &#150; is now rapidly turning into an industrial zone.</p>

<p>There is also a question mark over the White House's top environmental regulator, 

Christine Todd Whitman. She is thought to have fought unsuccessfully to prevent 

the latest anti-environmental measures, just as she fought unsuccessfully to maintain 

Washington's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. In an editorial 

this week, <i>The New York Times</i> urged her not to resign, saying she was the 

environmentalists' only advocate within the administration.</p>

<p>The Bush administration has shown it is not immune to some environmental appeals. 

Last year, it vetoed two projects in Florida, where the President's brother, Governor 

Jeb Bush, happened to be facing a tough re-election battle.</p> </p>
