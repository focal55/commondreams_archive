WASHINGTON (Reuters) - 

Senior executives of several major

oil companies will testify on Tuesday before a Senate panel

investigating why American motorists are paying sharply higher

gasoline prices.

<p>



The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations

issued a nearly 400-page report on Monday that said the main

reason behind rising fuel prices was a series of oil company

mergers in the past few years that gave firms more market

power.

<p>

The Democratic-led panel also alleged that Marathon Ashland

Petroleum deliberately withheld supplies in early 2000 to keep

fuel prices high. A Marathon spokesman denied any wrongdoing by

the company.

<p>

Several other big oil companies failed to have adequate

U.S. gasoline supplies on hand to meet demand during the past

two years, the panel's report said.

<p>

Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the

subcommittee, said he was holding a two-day hearing to discuss

how gasoline is priced and why it has become so volatile.

<p>

Gasoline marketing managers and vice presidents with BP,

Exxon Mobil, Marathon Ashland Petroleum, ChevronTexaco and

Royal Dutch/Shell Group's U.S. unit Shell Oil were scheduled to

testify.

<p>

The Senate panel's report said motor fuel prices have

become more volatile than ever. "Gasoline prices now regularly

vary more in one month than they previously did in entire

years," it said.

<p>

This spring, U.S. retail gasoline prices increased at a

faster rate than at any other time in the past 50 years.

<p>

Prices have eased in the past few weeks. The Energy

Department said on Monday that the nationwide average gasoline

price was &#36;1.393 per gallon, down 23 cents from one year ago.

Prices are higher on the West Coast and tend to be cheaper in

the South and the Gulf Coast regions.

<p>

The federal government has forecast that the nationwide

price of unleaded regular gasoline will average &#36;1.46 a gallon

throughout the summer driving season.

<p>

The American Petroleum Institute said a series of federal

and state investigations over the last 30 years have found no

evidence of collusion or anti-competitive behavior in the oil

industry. Gasoline prices rise sharply when there are refinery

and pipeline interruptions, the oil industry group said.
