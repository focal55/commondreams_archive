<p>NEW DELHI, India &#150;&#150;  India and Pakistan resumed shelling along their tense border Saturday, killing three people hours after Pakistan said its jets shot down an unmanned Indian spy plane.<P>The renewed fighting came as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage left the region after trying to persuade the nuclear-armed rivals to ease tensions along their frontier in the disputed province of Kashmir.<P>Both sides have massed 1 million troops along the Line of Control &#150; the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan &#150; since New Delhi blamed Islamabad for a deadly attack by Islamic militants on its Parliament in December.<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="300">

</table></font>Armitage said Friday tensions between the two nations had eased but not enough to eliminate the threat of war.<P>Comments by India's navy chief on Saturday continued the confrontational tone.<P>"All the three forces (army, air force and navy) are fully prepared for war. We are capable of swinging into action at four hours' notice," Chief Admiral Madhavendra Singh was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India.<P>One woman on the Indian side of the border was killed Saturday when Pakistani shells whistled into her village in the Arnia area, 18 miles west of Jammu, the winter capital of India's northern Jammu-Kashmir state, police said. Several other people were injured, but details were sketchy, the officer said.<P>In Balnoi, another Indian village along the cease-fire line, two men were killed and three others wounded in shelling, police said. Balnoi is about 120 miles northwest of Jammu.<P>Pakistani officials did not immediately comment.<P>Violence continued in Jammu-Kashmir, India's only majority Muslim state. Four Muslim men were summoned out of their houses Friday night and gunned down by suspected Islamic guerrillas in the remote mountainous village of Bagarh, police said. The villagers were armed members of the local Village Defense Committee, who have been provided weapons and training by the state government to fight the militants.<P>The guerrillas have been fighting since 1989 to carve out a separate homeland for Kashmiris or merge Kashmir with Pakistan, which like India claims all of the Himalayan province.<P>They rarely target Muslims, attacking them only if they side with the authorities or are believed to be informers.<P>Government posters were put up at public places in the capital of Jammu-Kashmir telling people "ways to save yourself during an air raid."<P>They were posted a day after Pakistan said its air force jets shot down an unmanned Indian spy plane that crashed near Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city.<P>Pakistani officials said the plane was carrying an Israeli-made camera and caught fire moments after it came under attack late Friday.<P>Media were escorted to the wreckage, badly charred and still smoking, in a sugar cane field 10 miles inside Pakistani air space in the village of Dogran Kalan. Not much was left of the aircraft, but officials showed off the camera that they said had been aboard.<P>In New Delhi, the Defense Ministry issued a statement confirming the downing of the aircraft, known as an unmanned aerial vehicle or UAV.<P>"In the present state of deployment of armed forces, UAV missions from either side are a routine feature," the statement said.<P>India has threatened to take military action against Pakistan if it does not end its support of Islamic guerrillas who have carried out attacks on Indian military targets and in public places since 1989, killing more than 60,000 people. Pakistan says it offers diplomatic and moral support to the militants but denies arming them.<P>On Friday, Islamic militants said Pakistan already had closed their training camps &#150; a key Indian demand.<P>"We were asked to vacate camps in the Pakistan part of Kashmir in January and the process has already been completed," a senior commander of the Islamic militant Lashkar-e-Tayyaba told The Associated Press on Friday.<P>In Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials dismissed the claim.<P>A senior intelligence official in Kashmir told The Associated Press that infiltration was "heavy" in the Jammu region, where the frontier is spread across flatland and low hills, and insurgents can move unseen through the tall grass.<P>In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters that there were "growing indications" that infiltration across the Line of Control was "down significantly."<P>"But ... we can't at this point say that this change has been done on a permanent basis," Boucher said. "And that's what President Musharraf has promised; that's what we're looking for."<P>Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has suggested the joint patrolling of the frontier by Indian and Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan has said that is not feasible, proposing instead that a third party monitor the frontier &#150; a suggestion rejected by India.<P>India and Pakistan have fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.
