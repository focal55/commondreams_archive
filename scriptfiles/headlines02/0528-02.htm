<p> ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &#150;&#150;  Pakistan test-fired a missile Tuesday capable of carrying nuclear warheads into Indian territory, the third and final launch in a series of much-criticized tests. India said President Pervez Musharraf's speech on the Kashmir crisis was "dangerous" as well as "offensive and tasteless."<P>

India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, also said there was little chance the Indian prime minister would meet with Pakistan's president during an Asian leaders conference in Kazakhstan next month. The Russian president had offered to mediate the conflict during the gathering.

<P>"Personally, I don't see it as a possibility," Singh told a news conference. "You cannot put a pistol of terrorism to my temple with the finger on the trigger and say, 'Dialogue with me, or I will release this trigger of terrorism."<P>Singh also said U.S. forces in the region were not a deterrent.<P>"The physical presence of U.S. troops in certain parts of Pakistan is clearly known to us ... and it is not an inhibiting factor in policy determination," he said.<P>Singh also restated India's policy that it would not strike first with nuclear weapons if a war should erupt.<P>"India has not ever spoken of nuclear weapons," he said.<P>Britain, meanwhile, kept up diplomatic pressure on Pakistan. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said at a news conference after meeting Musharraf that the Pakistani leader was given a clear message to stop cross-border attacks by Kashmiri militants based in Pakistan.<P>"President Musharraf is under no doubt about expectations of the international community to take action, as well as the action he already has taken, to crack down on cross-border terrorism," he said.<P>"There is no doubt that in the past, Pakistan assisted those who they described as freedom fighters, but who the international community recognizes as terrorists," Straw said. The foreign secretary said the world was looking for proof that Pakistan has stopped its help to Kashmiri militants. He was to leave for India later Tuesday.<P>In his nationwide television address Sunday, Musharraf said Pakistan would not start a war, called attacks inside India the work of terrorists, renewed his call for unconditional negotiations. He warned, however, Pakistan would fight back fiercely if attacked by India and continue to support what he called Kashmir's "freedom struggle."<P>"We do not want war. But if war is thrust upon us, we would respond with full might and give a befitting reply," Musharraf said.<P>In India's first formal response, Singh issued a prepared statement charging that Musharraf had mocked the international community.<P>"The general engaged in an offensive and tasteless revilement of India," Singh said. "It contradicts his own expressed desire for peace and mocks the expectations of most of the international community."<P>Pakistan's missile test Tuesday coincided with the fourth anniversary of its underground nuclear test in 1998. That was conducted two weeks after India exploded its own nuclear weapons, and both countries declared themselves members of the club of nuclear-armed nations.<P>Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes earlier indicated India was not impressed by Pakistan's missile tests.<P>"Missiles are deployed by both armies," Fernandes told independent Star News Television, and troops have been "eyeball to eyeball for the past few months. But to say we are on the brink of war may not be proper."<P>"Naturally, our options will become fewer and fewer. Which option will finally prevail is something I cannot comment about now," Fernandes said.<P>Singh repeated India's contention that Musharraf has not shut down terrorist camps in Pakistan and said Musharraf's speech was "disappointing and dangerous."<P>"Disappointing as it merely repeats some earlier reassurances that remain unfulfilled today," Singh said in a televised address. "Dangerous because of deliberate posturing, tensions have been added, not reduced."<P><P>India accuses Pakistan of waging a proxy war by training, arming and funding Islamic militants based in Pakistan and Pakistan's portion of Kashmir, and allowing them or helping them to cross the frontier into Indian territory.<P>Pakistan has denied supporting the Islamic extremists with money and arms, but says it give "moral" support for what it calls a freedom struggle.<P>India and Pakistan have already fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir. Both nations claim the Himalayan province in its entirety.<P>Putin had sought to bring Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee together on the sidelines of the Council on Cooperation and Confidence Measures in Asia.<P>Pakistan has accepted the invitation, agreeing to talk to Vajpayee "anywhere, anytime." Singh's Tuesday comments again rejected that offer, restating that India would not hold talks until cross-border attacks stop.<P>Musharraf in January gave a landmark speech in which he vowed to halt terrorists operating from Pakistani territory. India claims he has done little to fulfill this pledge and that Pakistan-based Islamic militants continue to cross into Indian-controlled Kashmir.<P>Pakistan test-fired a HatfII missile, also known as an Abdali, which flew 108 miles, army officials said. It was the third missile tested by Pakistan since Saturday, all of them capable of carrying nuclear warheads into Indian.<P>Pakistan has defended the tests as routine, saying they had nothing to do with the current crisis in Kashmir. India conducted similar tests in January.<P>Relations were strained after an attack on India's Parliament in December, and became more contentious after an assault on an Indian army base in Kashmir earlier this month. India blamed Pakistan-based Islamic militants. Islamabad denounced both attacks as terrorism and denied any involvement.<P>Musharraf, in his speech Monday, said Pakistan had taken "bold steps" against the militants, referring to his January ban on five Islamic militant groups. He accused India of failing to reciprocate.<P>Musharraf said the same people who carried out those "terrorist" assaults in India were responsible for attacks in Pakistan, including an assault on a church frequented by foreigners and the bombing of a bus carrying French engineers.<P>The attacks are being carried out by people who "want to raise tensions as much as possible," he said.<P>Singh countered that Musharraf has not shut down the Pakistan-based militant training camps in Pakistan Kashmir.<P>"The current war against terrorism will not be won decisively until their base camps inside Pakistan are closed permanently," he said.<P>The United States and Britain have also urged Musharraf to do more to stop cross-border incursions by Islamic militants. Both nations were also critical of Pakistan's missile tests, saying they could only provoke greater tension.<P>Fernandes, the defense minister, said al-Qaida and Taliban fighters were operating in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.<P>A Pakistani army spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, rejected Fernandes' statement as baseless. Pakistan has repeatedly said that the fighters in Kashmir are Kashmiris.<P>The Bush administration has said al-Qaida and Taliban forces have likely spread across dozens of countries, far from their former headquarters in Afghanistan. U.S. Special Forces troops recently deployed to western Pakistan's tribal belt to help Pakistani troops flush the militants out.
