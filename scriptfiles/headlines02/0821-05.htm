<p> A tribal rights group based in India has welcomed an initiative by a global 

network of scientists and groups advocating the rights of indigenous people to 

raise the profile of traditional forms of knowledge around the world. 

<p> <a href="http://www.rlek.org/" target="_new">Rural Litigation & Entitlement 

Kendra</a> (RLEK), a nongovernmental organization working with indigenous groups 

in the foothills of the Himalayas, said that it fully supported a move by the 

world's largest body of scientists to promote agricultural and medical practices 

that have long been part of the indigenous traditions. 

<p> "Indigenous knowledge, such as systems of preserving forests, is under threat 

because Western or scientific knowledge does not take note of it," said RLEK's 

chairman Avdhash Kaushal. "But we have seen over the years that it is traditional 

knowledge that actually takes care of nature," he said. 

<p> The call for a more "ethical and responsible" approach to environmental management, 

drawing on traditional knowledge, will be made at the <a href="http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/" target="_new">United 

Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development</a>, which opens next week in 

Johannesburg, South Africa. 

<p> A paper on the subject, entitled 'Convention on Knowledge,' will be presented 

to summit delegates by a group of organizations, including the <a href="http://www.inesglobal.org/" target="_new">International 

Network of Engineers and Scientists for Global Responsibility</a>, a grouping 

of more than 90 organizations in some 40 countries, the London-based <a href="http://www.i-sis.org.uk/" target="_new">Institute 

of Science in Society</a>, and Malaysia-based <a href="http://www.twnside.org.sg/" target="_new">Third 

World Network</a> (TWN). 

<p> The presentation will focus on the need to counter aspects of science and 

technology which have a damaging impact on environmental habitats and are leading 

to the demise of indigenous and other more benign forms of interaction with the 

natural world. Knowledge, the paper said, must not be used for "destructive, oppressive 

or aggressive" military ends. 

<p> "The poor bear the brunt of the destructive impacts of bad science and technology," 

said TWN's director Martin Khor in a statement published this week, "whether it 

be climate change, or environmental degradation created by intensive agriculture, 

chemical and biological pollution." 

<p> The paper also stressed the need for protecting knowledge which has been passed 

down within indigenous nations. RLEK's Kaushal stressed that there were several 

local indigenous practices that took better care of the environment than laws 

which India inherited from its former British colonial rulers. 

<p> Kaushal cited the example of a tribal community, the Van Gujars, who live 

in forested areas on the outskirts of the north Indian city of Dehradun, and who 

named animals for gods to ensure the sanctity of wildlife. In the wedding ceremonies 

of some tribes, he said, saplings were planted, thus helping to protect the natural 

canopy. 

<p> "The bride leaves her village to get married, but the sapling is looked after 

by all her friends and relatives as a symbol of fertility," he said, noting that 

such practices could be adopted by nations which sought to combine economic development 

with environmental protection. 

<p> The joint paper for the "Earth Summit" also acknowledged that "cross-fertilizations 

and partnerships between different knowledge systems and practices" were necessary 

to ensure that economic development did not jeopardize the conservation of wildlife. 

<p> "Knowledge should make the world equitable and life-enhancing for all its 

inhabitants," according to the paper. "Its first aim is to do no harm - to human 

beings and to other species. It must respect basic human rights and dignity."</i>
