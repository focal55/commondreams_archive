<p> It is an unlikely place for a peace movement to start: a classic country pub 

in the North-East of England with its car park full of Mondeos and Astras and 

its brass fittings and rural prints on the walls. But in the Nag's Head in Sedgefield 

this weekend feelings are running high. Neil Hetherington, the landlord, has never 

thought of himself as a political man. But his voice may now be heard by more 

than his Sunday regulars. 

<P>'Tony Blair seems to be like George Bush's puppet,' he said last week. 'We 

should only go to war if there is a genuine threat against us.' 

<P>Hetherington is not alone. In Sedgefield, Tony Blair's constituency, a new 

poll has shown almost two-thirds of people oppose war with Iraq. Secret polls 

conducted by Downing Street show a profound unease across the country at the prospect 

of military action in the Middle East. Bush is apparently even less popular than 

either the euro or the Conservatives. 

<P>Last week it was the anti-war lobby's turn to hold the floor. The gung-ho graphics 

showing the route the Americans will take to Baghdad were banished from the newspapers, 

the hard men putting the case for the war on Saddam Hussein disappeared from view, 

the hawks kept their silence. 

<P>First up were the soldiers. The former British Chief of Defense Staff, Field 

Marshal Lord Bramall, said Britain risked being dragged into a 'very, very messy' 

and lengthy war. 'You don't have licence to attack someone else's country just 

because you don't like the leadership,' he said. General Sir Michael Rose, the 

former commander of the SAS, warned that Iraq would be Bush's Vietnam. 

<P>Next came the MPs. Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP and Father of the House of Commons, 

demanded the recall of Parliament before Britain joined any military action. Then 

came the clerics. Four senior Anglican bishops, including Dr Rowan Williams, the 

next Archbishop of Canterbury, signed a petition that was handed in at Downing 

Street declaring that an attack on Iraq would be immoral and illegal. A further 

eight diocesan bishops all said it would not, at present, constitute 'a just war'. 

The big union bosses, like Bill Morris of the TGWU, made their opposition clear 

too. 

<P>Overseas Gerhard Schr&#246;der, the German Chancellor, launched his re-election 

campaign by saying that Germany would not be not be 'available for adventures'. 

Sweden's Foreign Minister, Anna Lindh, agreed. In the Middle East the Saudis said 

they were not going to help a campaign that King Abdullah of Jordan called 'somewhat 

ludicrous'. By the end of the week support was coming from the most unexpected 

of quarters. Hollywood star Woody Harrelson announced that the 'war on terrorism 

is terrorism'. And even the previously gung-ho Daily Mail was calling the American 

President 'militarist'. The hawks appeared on the defensive, the doves triumphant. 

<P>But will it prove to be a hollow victory? Was it a victory at all? Are Blair 

and Bush at all interested in what the 'whiners' and 'appeasers' have to say? 

And if they are not listening to the peace lobby, then who are they listening 

to? 

<P>Behind the high pink stone walls of his rented chateau in south-west France, 

Blair is attempting to relax with his family. But the red boxes keep arriving 

and if Blair had hoped his holiday - and those of Foreign Secretary Jack Straw 

and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon - might calm the feverish speculation about war 

in the Gulf he was wrong. 

<P>When Mike O'Brien, the Foreign Office Minister responsible for the Middle East, 

obediently repeated in an interview on Wednesday the official Downing Street line 

that a war in Iraq was 'not imminent' he cannot have expected to make the front 

pages. 

<P>The next day's rash of headlines, suggesting that British Ministers were frustrated 

at Washington's inability to come up with a definite battle plan, left Downing 

Street despairing: attempts to cool the rhetoric had only provoked fresh stories. 

Ministers have been told to keep their heads down. 'There is an overly excitable 

mood amongst the political classes, and the game is far from clear yet,' says 

one senior government source. 

<P>But Number 10 knows the issue will not go away. Pollster Philip Gould has been 

discreetly testing voters' feelings about Britain's relationship with the US and 

its relationship with Europe - the two dominant themes of the coming autumn, when 

Blair must juggle looming war in the Gulf with a possible referendum on the euro. 

And the flood of contradictory battle plans filling the American newspapers have 

hampered the British Government's task of persuading voters that there is nothing 

to worry about yet. 

<P>So, if Blair wants to go to war, can the polls be turned around in time? Peter 

Mandelson, who has just returned from a trip to Washington, suggests they could. 

The two key figures on whom Blair will rely for advice in shifting public opinion 

are Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff at Downing Street, and Sir David Manning, 

his foreign policy adviser. Both have excellent Washington connections: Manning 

will transfer to Washington shortly as ambassador, but a likely replacement is 

the current British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Derek Plumbly, who has a profound 

understanding of the Arab world. 

<P>Together, the Downing Street team will hope to repeat the tactic used during 

the Afghanistan conflict: publicly they stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the 

Americans, hoping privately to get advance access to - and influence on - military 

and diplomatic strategies. 

<P>But in Europe it is the US's hazy plans for a post-Saddam regime that are fueling 

alarm. The French government was unimpressed by the speed with which the Americans 

dumped the multi-million pound responsibility for reconstruction and peacekeeping 

in Afghanistan on EU countries. Bush, says Mandelson, has not yet mastered an 

'international language' that resonates with both frightened Americans and wary 

Europeans. The EU states, meanwhile, insist there must be a new UN mandate for 

action. 

<P>Several of Blair's own Cabinet Ministers share that view. Talk of Cabinet resignations 

may be overheated, but Blair could lose a handful of more junior Ministers if 

the war is not seen to have international authority. 

<P>Labour is braced, too, for clashes with the grass roots during party conference 

season this autumn. A noisy confrontation with anti-war union leaders at September's 

TUC conference in Blackpool could be defused by the fact that Blair will address 

them the day before the anniversary of 11 September: delegates might be in too 

somber a mood to make much trouble. 

<P>But there will be few such qualms when he returns to Blackpool three weeks 

later for Labour's own conference, the eve of which will be marked by a massive 

anti-war rally. Conference votes are not binding, but Blair will not want to be 

seen facing internal dissent at what may be a crucial time in American preparations. 

<P>The plush bar of the Ritz Carlton hotel in 'Pentagon City' is where the military 

top brass like to go for a cool drink and a chat before returning to the Virginia 

suburbs, dinner and the family. It's also where they get to know the Pentagon's 

civilian political appointees - the people whom the soldiers watch coming and 

going with the Presidents. 

<P>Usually the atmosphere is convivial. Now, however, it is as cold as the beer. 

There is little love lost between the professional soldiers and politicians working 

for - and ferociously loyal to - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, 

Paul Wolfowitz. 

<P>The military are content with the policy of containment that they, and most 

experts, see as having boxed in Saddam Hussein since the Gulf war of 1991. The 

political appointees, meanwhile, are anxious to unleash America's military might 

against the Baghdad regime. 'I spend half my day telling generals how to fight 

a war,' jeered one senior aide to Wolfowitz. 

<P>Both sides are seeking to win over America's President and people. The civilian 

politicians have the advantage of a political affinity with the White House and 

the sympathetic ear of George Bush. The military are countering with a series 

of carefully managed leaks to the press of battle plans which if carried out, 

they say in private, could result in calamity. 

<P>Whereas in Britain it is the doves who are holding the floor, in the US it 

is the hawks who are making their case most forcibly. Though claims of a connection 

between an al-Qaeda hijacker and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague have 

been debunked, Rumsfeld says that 'absolute proof' of Iraqi complicity in 11 September 

is not necessary to justify an invasion. Like their British counterparts, the 

American hawks point out that time is short: 'The whole question is, how long 

do you wait with Saddam Hussein in possession of capabilities he has and would 

like to have?', says Richard Perle, former Defense Secretary and now director 

of the Defense Policy Board. 

<P>Even hawkish sources, however, discount the likelihood of military action this 

side of the congressional elections in November. They are aware that a war could 

easily dominate the remainder of the Bush presidency. Instead they tip early spring 

as the time for a strike. 

<P>The most influential of the doves are the military themselves, including General 

Tommy Franks, who ran the war against the Taliban. They are aware of the potential 

for disaster. 

<P>Military officials argue that a combination of the 'no-fly zones' enforced 

over north and south Iraq, a sporadic bombing, a US military presence near Iraq's 

borders and sanctions has prevented Saddam from threatening his neighbors, let 

alone the US, or even effectively updating his arsenal. 

<P>'I'd argue that containment is certainly a better approach than either marching 

on Baghdad or destabilizing the Iraqi government by killing Saddam,' said Colonel 

Richard Dunn, a former army strategist. 

<P>The key question contested by hawks and doves is whether Saddam has the ability 

to hit Israel or other US allies in the region with non-conventional weapons. 

The military think not. The civilian hawks, basing their assessment on intelligence 

reports, say that, even if he can't now, he will be able to soon. 

<P>Colin Powell's State Department is more concerned with the aftermath of an 

attack. His officials say they fear an invasion could disrupt the region even 

more than Saddam currently does. 

<P>There are signs that the hawks aren't having it all their own way. Senior Republican 

senators, including a Texan, publicly voiced their unease last week. There are 

other signs that anti-war sentiments are growing outside 'the Beltway'. A local 

paper in Buffalo, New York state, called for the 'saber-rattling' to stop. 'Why 

give radical anti-American Islamists even more political ammunition with which 

to recruit suicide bombers and attract the financial donations that fund their 

assaults?', it argued. 

<P>In the New York Times , two of Washington's most respected foreign policy experts 

at the Brookings Institution, Michael O'Hanlon and Philip Gordon, argued for containment. 

The New Yorker magazine devoted its lead comment piece to a fervently argued case 

against war. In the Los Angeles Times , a commentary headlined: 'Weighing a just 

war, or settling an old score?' opened with the line: 'What the heck, let's bomb 

Baghdad. 

<P>'Sure, it's one of the more historically important cities in the world, and 

many of its more than three million inhabitants will probably end up as "collateral 

damage". But if George the younger is determined to avenge his father and keep 

his standing in the polls, that's the price to be paid.' 

<P>The war for public opinion in the UK, the US and elsewhere is clearly just 

beginning. Many analysts believe that the hawks have merely made a tactical withdrawal 

and are marshalling their forces for a major push to convert public opinion in 

the autumn. 'There is a sense that the doves have committed themselves too early. 

They will run out of arguments just when the hawks start to make the case for 

attacking Saddam,' said Daniel Neep, an Iraq specialist at the Royal United Services 

Institute. 'Watch this space.'</p>
