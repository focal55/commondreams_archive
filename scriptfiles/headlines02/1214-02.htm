<p>CARACAS, Venezuela  - Venezuela's embattled  President Hugo Chavez on Saturday dismissed U.S. calls for  early elections to end the crisis over his rule in the world's  No. 5 oil exporter.

<p>



		Chavez, faced with a protracted opposition strike that has  crippled the nation's vital oil industry, said in an interview  broadcast on Saturday by local television that an early vote  would be unconstitutional.<p>



		"I think they haven't properly evaluated Venezuelan  affairs. They are confused. We will have to send them a copy of  the constitution," the president told "CNN en Espanol."<p>

</table></font>The White House, raising international pressure on the  populist former paratrooper, on Friday said early elections  were the only viable solution to Venezuela's political turmoil.  The South American nation supplies about one-sixth of U.S. oil  imports.<p>



		Chavez, who was elected in 1998 and survived a military  coup in April, has repeatedly said the constitution only allows  for a binding referendum on his mandate in August 2003. He  accuses his foes of trying to topple his government by  destroying the oil sector with a strike.<p>



		"There are no early elections planned here. ... I don't  think that the United States government is suggesting to the  world that Venezuela must break with its constitution just to  satisfy the pretensions of coup mongers," the president said.<p>



		But opposition leaders, a loose alliance of political  parties, unions and business leaders who blame Chavez for the  nation's troubles, insist he resign and call immediate  elections.<p>



		"Either the president resigns to facilitate a solution or  we fix a date that can't be beyond the start of next year for  presidential elections," said Alejandro Armas, an opposition  negotiator in talks with the government chaired by Organization  of American States Secretary General Cesar Gaviria.<p>



		BATTLE OF WILLS OVER OIL SECTOR<p>



		Since April, when rebel officers briefly ousted Chavez in a  chaotic coup, international mediators have struggled to bring  the two sides to the table to reach an electoral solution to  their long-running conflict.<p>



		The opposition strike, which began on Dec. 2 and is now in  its 13th day, has brought the oil industry to a standstill and  sent Venezuelans rushing to stock up on food and gasoline.  Banks are partly closed and many other businesses remain  shuttered.<p>



		With striking oil tankers moored offshore and refineries  disrupted, the shutdown has become a battle of wills over the  oil sector.<p>



		The nation's oil output, which accounts for about half of  the government's revenues, is at less than a third of normal.<p>



		The president insists that the shutdown has been a failure  and blames dissident oil executives at the state oil firm PDVSA  for trying to destabilize the nation.<p>



		"There is no strike in Venezuela. There is an oil industry  conspiracy. ... The country is working," he said during the CNN  interview.<p>



		The president has moved to break the strike using troops to  secure gasoline distribution and bringing in replacement  workers to cover striking harbor pilots, dock hands and oil  workers. He said on Friday he was prepared to bring in foreign  oil technicians.<p>



		Chavez said one oil vessel had been dispatched with exports  bound for the United States. Shippers said on Friday that the  vessel, the Josefa Camejo, loaded with 550,000 barrels of oil,  had been chartered for the United States. But they raised  concerns over whether its cargo had been properly certified.<p>



		Leaders of the anti-government shutdown have dismissed the  president's claims he can restart the battered industry, saying  it would be impossible to replace all of the strikers among the  40,000 employees of the state oil firm.<p></p>
