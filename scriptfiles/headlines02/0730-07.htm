Filipinos protest the upcoming visit of U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell in 

a bay behind the U.S. embassy in Manila July 30, 2002. Powell is scheduled to 

meet top Philippine officials on August 3. The group also denounced Philippine 

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's government's plans to extend the deployment 

of U.S. troops training their Philippine counterparts as part of Washington's 

fight against terrorism. Photo by Romeo Ranoco/Reuters<br>

</table></font>Anti-riot troops armed with truncheons, assault rifles and  machineguns sealed off the gate of a stadium in southern  Zamboanga, where the protesters had massed, to prevent a  possible clash with pro-U.S. demonstrators holding a separate  rally in the city.<p>In the capital Manila, a dozen other protesters waded  through chest-deep waters on Manila Bay adjacent to the U.S.  Embassy building and waved signs reading: "Powell, you're not  welcome here" and "Goodbye, Joe, don't come back."<p>Powell is to make an overnight visit to Manila later this  week in the course of an Asian tour to be highlighted by the  signing of an anti-terror declaration between the United States  and 10 Southeast Asian nations in Brunei on Wednesday.<p>Tuesday's protests occurred on the eve of the formal end of  a six-month counter-terrorism exercise between U.S. troops and  Filipino soldiers in the southern Philippines. About 1,000  Americans are involved in the training.<p>The exercises were intended to upgrade Filipino skills in  fighting the Abu Sayyaf rebels, whom the United States has  linked to Islamic militant Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda  network.<p>Powell is expected to discuss with President Gloria  Macapagal Arroyo on Saturday the possibility of holding more  military exercises as part of the U.S.-led campaign against  terror.<p>SUPPORT FOR EXERCISES<p>Although recent surveys showed more than 80 percent of  Filipinos supported the exercises, leftist and nationalist  groups have opposed the training as violating the country's  constitution, which bars foreign troops from Philippine soil  unless under a treaty.<p>Leftist anger was heightened by accusations by two  lawmakers that a U.S. soldier had shot and wounded a civilian  suspected of links with the Abu Sayyaf when Filipino troops  last week raided his house to arrest him.<p>The U.S. Embassy denied the accusation and said the  American, an army medical officer, was called in by the local  military to treat the wounded rebel.<p>Tuesday's anti-U.S. protest in Zamboanga took place 1.8  miles from the Philippine military headquarters, where American  troops were staying.<p>"U.S. troops out now" and "U.S. no. 1 terrorist," the  protesters shouted.<p>The group included several Americans and Europeans  belonging to an international group of peace activists.<p>Tension mounted in Zamboanga -- a largely Christian city of  700,000 about 535 miles south of Manila -- on Monday night when  the leftists rode in a motorcade through the city.

<p>Residents rained stones on the motorcade, injuring one person.</p>
