<p>Convicted killer Napoleon Beazley, who was a juvenile when he committed murder, was executed, after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles ignored pleas for clemency from around the world.</p>

<p>Beazley, 25, was brought from his holding cell at a Huntsville, Texas prison at 6:01 pm (2301 GMT), and administered the lethal solution three minutes later. He was pronounced dead at 6:17 PM, prison officials said.</p>

<p>In his final statement, Beazley called the murder "senseless" and said he was "sorry" about the death of 63-year-old Texas businessman John Luttig.</p>

<p>Beazley had no criminal record before he was convicted in the 1994 shooting death of Luttig, who was the father of a judge.</p>

<p>"The act I committed to put me here was not just heinous, it was senseless," he said. "But the person that committed that act is no longer here -- I am.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that John Luttig died. And I'm sorry that it was something in me that caused all of this to happen to begin with.</p>

<p>Beazley's execution was initially scheduled for last August, but was delayed by an appeals court in Texas amid doubts about the quality of defense received by Beazley while his appeal was being considered.</p>

<p>In his statement, Beazley criticized the state's use of capital punishment, saying, "tonight, we tell our children that in some instances, in some cases, killing is right."</p>

<p>Beazley was the son of an alderman in Grapeland, Texas and once president of his high school class.</p>

<p>Rejecting calls from around the world to spare his life, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted earlier in the day to go ahead with the execution, clearing the way in a 10-7 vote.</p>

<p>Because Beazley was 17 at the time, his case has drawn international attention, and appeals to spare his life have poured in from around the world.</p>

<p>According to the Death Penalty Information Center, there are currently 82 inmates on death row in the United States who were minors at the time they committed their crimes. </p>
