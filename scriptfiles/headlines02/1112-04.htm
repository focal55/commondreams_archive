Bush issued a tough new warning to Saddam Hussein yesterday as administration 

officials said that a war could begin before the end of the year.</p> 

<p>In a series of Veterans' Day memorial services, Mr Bush said he was ready to 

take his country to war. Unless President Saddam Hussein fully disarmed, "America 

will lead a coalition to fully disarm him.</p>

<p>"I have no greater responsibility than protecting the American people. Should 

military action become necessary for our own security, I will commit the full 

force and might of the United States' military, and we will prevail," he said.</p>

<p>Colin Powell, the American Secretary of State, told CNN: "We're not going to 

wait until February to see whether Iraq is co-operating or not.''</p>

<p>The Iraqi leader began the process of deciding a formal response to the United 

Nations Security Council resolution, which calls on his government to provide 

free and unfettered access to weapons inspectors or else face "serious consequences". 

Iraq has until Friday to respond. If President Saddam rejects the resolution, 

Mr Bush is determined to act alone if necessary to punish him with massive military 

strikes.</p>

<p>Iraq's parliament gathered in a bellicose mood yesterday and dismissed the 

resolution as a document "packed with lies". To applause from the 250 deputies, 

the head of the assembly's foreign relations committee urged parliament to reject 

the UN resolution. The parliament's recommendation &#150; which is to be endorsed 

by the Revolutionary Command Council chaired by President Saddam &#150; is not 

expected until later today at the earliest.</p>

<p>Mr Bush said at a ceremony at Arlington Cemetery: "This great nation will not 

live at the mercy of any foreign plot or power. We will not permit a dictator 

who's used weapons of mass destruction to threaten America with chemical, biological 

or nuclear weapons." According to leaks in the American press at the weekend, 

Mr Bush has approved a battle plan involving a 250,000-strong force if Iraq fails 

to comply.</p>

<p>After Friday's deadline to accept the UN's terms and promise to comply, Iraq 

has until 8 December to give weapons inspectors a declaration of all its chemical, 

biological and nuclear programs.</p> </p>
