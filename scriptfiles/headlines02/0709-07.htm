<p> LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany - German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder blamed U.S. corporate 

culture for recent accounting scandals and lauded Europe's model on Tuesday as 

President Bush launched new penalties for such abuses.

<P>Faced with a raft of accounting abuses, including at energy  firm Enron and telecoms giant WorldCom, Bush unveiled a number  of proposals on Tuesday aimed at fighting fraud and rebuilding  confidence in corporate America's finances.<P>A senior European Union official also blasted U.S.  corporate practice saying American accounting rules had been  used to raise share prices rather than reflect fair company  values.<P>Addressing employees at chemical giant BASF in the town of  Ludwigshafen, Schroeder defended the German corporate system  which encourages workers and employers to cooperate on the  supervisory boards that steer the direction of their companies.<P>"Now it has been revealed that egotism practiced at the top  under the catchphrase 'shareholder value' is worth less in  macroeconomic terms, but also as far as the companies  themselves are concerned, than a system based on a fair balance  between the interests of workers and employers," he said.<P>Schroeder, who has often rejected calls to adopt what he  calls U.S. "hire and fire" practices to help create more jobs  in Germany, said the scandals at Enron and WorldCom showed that  the American economic model should not always be emulated in  Europe.<P>"That is presumably just the tip of the iceberg and it has  to do with a corporate culture which is different from here.  There the individual employee is not valued and shareholder  value is everything," he said.<P>"Egoism at the top does not suffice to have lasting  economic success," he said. "It must perhaps lie in the  structure and not just individual lapses."<P>Among Bush's proposals were doubling the maximum jail term  for fraud, stronger laws against document shredding -- as  accountants Andersen did at Enron -- boosting oversight of  corporate pay and auditing, and setting up a fraud task force.<P>EU ALREADY TAKING ACTION<P>Asked to respond to Bush's speech to Wall Street leaders,  European Union Commission spokesman for internal markets  Jonathan Todd said the EU's executive body had been active on  the corporate governance front for many years.<P>"Ever since the 1970s, it has been a requirement under EU  law to ensure that accounts give a fair view of what is the  true value of a company," he said.<P>"One has the impression that accounting rules in the U.S.  have been used as a tool to push up share prices rather than to  reflect the fair value of a company."<P>Todd said an EU action plan on financial services reform  was geared to boosting investors confidence by concrete means  such as the planned introduction of international accounting  standards and rules on independent auditors.<P>In France, Michel Prada, head of the COB stock market  watchdog, said he doubted there were similar cases of financial  fraud in France.<P>He told France 2 television he could not say that French  firms had been under more pressure in recent years from  shareholders to produce strong results.<P>"That's not the impression I have," he said. "I think we  have to be very careful not to compare an American situation in  which some companies had cases of real fraud with the situation  on the French markets.<P>"We have good reasons to think that the transparency and  pertinence of information provided by French companies are well  controlled. So I would like to warn against the temptation to  think that what happens four or five thousand kilometers from  here would be happening in France."<P>Prada said the COB conducts about 90 investigations of  company finances per year, with about 10 to 15 resulting in  charges against the firms in question.

<P>"This is not more than we used to have," he said.</span>
