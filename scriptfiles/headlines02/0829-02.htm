<p> The United States is blocking human, environmental and freedom of information 

rights from being enshrined in the earth summit's plan of action in order to protect 

multinational companies from litigation and protests by the poor.

</table>The EU and developing countries such as Thailand, Uganda and Indonesia believe 

that giving communities the right to take on companies that pollute their environment 

and damage their health is fundamental to the aims of the summit. 

<P>But as well as concern about a potential rash of court cases from environmental 

and community groups, the White House believes the freedom of information and 

human rights clauses could be used to obtain documents and fight security measures 

taken following the September 11 attacks. 

<P>Some key developing countries such as India and China are also nervous about 

giving citizens' groups the right to take on industry. Both have heavily contaminated 

industrial areas which cause illness and even premature death in local people. 

<P>In a briefing yesterday, the UK was careful not to point the finger of blame 

but said: "If people can exercise their civil and political rights, such as freedom 

of expression, they can demand cleaner air and water. And poor environmental protection 

can constitute an obstacle to the full realization of some human rights, such 

as the right to health and in extreme cases, the right to life. Environmental 

justice also fights to redress current patterns of concentrating toxic industries 

in poorer neighborhoods and countries, hurting the most vulnerable." 

<P>Chip Pitts, a US human rights lawyer, said: "This is all about the US fearing 

restrictions on its freedom of action in third world countries. In part, it is 

a way of protecting big corporations' vested interests but partly fear of interference 

with the war on terrorism, giving Islamic groups a forum to have a go at the White 

House." 

<P>Indonesia is keen on the issue because action by community groups has been 

instrumental in stopping illegal logging and environmental destruction. 

<P>Mr Pitts pointed to a court case in Washington where Exxon, the US oil giant, 

is being sued by the International Labor Organization on behalf of people from 

Aceh in Sumatra, where Exxon is extracting gas. 

<P>The allegation is that Exxon hired local police to protect their plant against 

protests of people who had not been consulted before it was built. As a result, 

it is claimed, local people were injured and are seeking redress in the federal 

court. Exxon appealed to the US government for help; the State Department this 

week filed a legal opinion that the court had no jurisdiction and the case was 

"an interference in the foreign affairs of the US". 

<P>Mr Pitts said: "You can see where the administration is coming from - putting 

the private interest of big corporations before the public interest." 

<P>Two recent UK examples of where freedom of information, environmental and human 

rights would help protesters are the night flights issue at Heathrow and the Ilisu 

dam in Turkey. 

<P>The issue at Heathrow is whether residents have the right to a night's sleep 

or whether this is overridden by the airline's desire for a 24-hour operation, 

an issue still undecided. In the Ilisu dam case, if Balfour Beatty had not pulled 

out of the construction, the British government would have found itself in court 

for violating the rights of those whose homes would be taken by the building of 

the dam.</p>
