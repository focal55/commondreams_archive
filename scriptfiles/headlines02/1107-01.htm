<p>BUOYED by this week's congressional election victory, George W. Bush has turned 

up the heat on Saddam Hussein with a push for the UN Security Council to vote 

this week on a tough new resolution demanding Iraq disarm or face war.

<p> The US announced yesterday it wanted a vote tomorrow on its resolution requiring 

Iraq to own up and destroy its weapons of mass destruction or suffer "serious 

consequences". Mr Bush, who argued strongly for the need to disarm Iraq as he 

campaigned for Republican candidates, can claim Tuesday's strong election result 

for conservatives has underlined voters' backing for a possible war. 

<p> Now, after two months of negotiating, the President is calling on France, 

Russia and China in the Security Council to back the joint US-British plan for 

a new inspection program backed by the prospect of military force.

<p> In a concession to France, the US resolution would not authorise automatic 

use of military force if Iraq fails to comply with the terms set by the UN, but 

instead calls for a meeting by the Security Council to consider action.

<p> Regardless of the Security Council's decision, the US could act alone or with 

allies.

<p> Democrats and Republicans agreed one of the messages from the Republicans' 

resounding election win was that the President's high-profile campaigning had 

made the election, in part, a referendum on the war on terrorism.

<P> "It means that the President has an opportunity here to enact and proceed 

with the plan (on Iraq) as he has articulated it," said Tom Daschle, who lost 

his position as Senate leader when Republicans won back the majority. "The American 

people appear now to give him the benefit of the doubt."

<P> Republican Trent Lott, who takes the Senate leader's position, said the election 

that defied much historical precedent by increasing the number of seats held by 

a President's party, was a referendum on Mr Bush's leadership. "The American people 

said, 'Yes, we trust this man'," he said. 

<P> While the Democrat-run Senate had passed a resolution granting Mr Bush the 

right to go to war with Iraq if necessary, the fact the Republicans now run the 

White House and both congressional chambers has given him even greater political 

backing.

<P> Some senior Russian politicians expressed concerns the election result would 

see a more aggressive US approach to Iraq.

<P> "Bush's position on Iraq can now only be stopped by the international community 

&#150; NATO, Russia and the major Arab states," said Alexei Arabatov, a leading 

liberal politician in the Duma.

<P> But Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the US was working to win 

international co-operation to disarm Iraq, "and I expect no change in that stance".

<P> War could come soon, with UN inspectors likely to be sent back to Iraq within 

10 days of the resolution being passed.

<P> If Iraq refused to comply with the requirements of the resolution &#150; such 

as failing to list all its weapons programs within 30 days, or blocking the inspectors 

&#150; it would cross a "red line", US Secretary of State Colin Powell said this 

week.

<P> A new concern expressed by French, Russian and Chinese diplomats centres on 

the question of who would decide if the "red line" had been crossed.

<P> These diplomats believe that the weapons inspectors must be the ones to accuse 

Iraq of a breach of the resolution, and report back to the Security Council for 

action. 

<P> But new language in the US resolution could allow Washington to circumvent 

the arms inspectors, by itself reporting to the UN.</P>
