VICTORIA -- B.C. Forests Minister Mike de Jong has called the United States a "hostile foreign power" that is attacking forest-dependent communities and families in BC

<p>De Jong used the inflammatory rhetoric Monday as the provincial government vowed to fight the impending tariffs on softwood lumber that have already led to BC mill closures, and to put together a plan to help hard-hit communities.</p>

</font>"It's a plan made necessary by virtue of the fact that our forest-dependent communities and forest-dependent families are under attack by a hostile foreign power. It's that simple," de Jong said in the legislature.

<p>Premier Gordon Campbell said de Jong was expressing the frustration felt by all Canadians over the breakdown of softwood lumber negotiations last week.</p>

<p>"We were told throughout this negotiation that we were making real progress and it turns out there was none," Campbell said while promising victory in the long run.</p>

<p>"I want all British Columbians to know that we are going to fight that decision legally, politically and persistently, and we are going to win," the premier said in a statement to the legislature Monday.</p>

<p>Campbell said BC held off a major campaign to take the softwood fight to the American people because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>"The very families whose jobs are in jeopardy today are the families who were holding bake sales so they could send resources from their community down to the people in New York to offer support. They reached out. Now our best friend has decided to slap those families in the face."</p>

<p>Campbell called for a concerted Canadian response and promised to convene as soon as possible a summit of all the players in the dispute, including the federal and provincial governments, business and labor.</p>

<p>The premier was careful to distinguish between American consumers, who he said would also suffer because of the decision, and the "lumber barons" seeking protection from the tariff.</p>

<p>Campbell promised a campaign to reach those consumers, who will now have to pay more for housing.</p>

<p>De Jong accused the Americans of being "duplicitous" in the negotiations even as President George W. Bush was on the road pushing for the expansion of free trade.</p>

<p>"At the very time the president of the United States is down in Mexico in Monterrey defending not just the principles of free trade generally but North American free trade, his political henchmen back in Washington are sticking it to British Columbia and sticking it to Canada. It made everyone in that room in Washington sick to their stomachs to watch that unfold."</p>

<p>Campbell used milder language but stuck to the same message.</p>

<p>"The president of the United States is currently going through Latin America and espousing the benefits of free trade. Words mean nothing. There's only one thing that counts: action," he said while attacking the "punitive and outrageous" decision of the US commerce department to hit Canadian softwood lumber with a 29-per-cent duty.</p>

<p>He said Canada would eventually win legal battles before the World Trade Organization and through the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

<p>The premier ruled out subsidies for business, however.</p>

<p>"It is very difficult to win an argument that says we do not have a subsidized industry, if we go out and subsidize the industry. I think most people understand that, including those in the industry."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BC New Democratic Party leader Joy MacPhail wrote federal Natural Resources Minister Herb Dhaliwal on Monday asking for aid -- perhaps in the form of market-rate loans -- to help forest firms cope.</p>

<p>MacPhail also advised Campbell to urge the federal government to use Bush's desire for a pipeline to move Alaskan natural gas through Canada as a lever in the softwood dispute.</p>

<p>Campbell did not comment directly on that suggestion, but echoed concerns voiced by the federal government about the risks of retaliation.</p>
