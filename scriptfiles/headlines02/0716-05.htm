<p>LIMA - Latin America's top rights court will reopen the case of Lori Berenson, 

a New Yorker and former MIT student serving 20 years for aiding Peruvian leftist 

rebels, and could order her freed or retried in Peru, her lawyer said yesterday. 

<p> The Organization of American States' court, whose decision would be legally 

binding on member state Peru, is the last legal avenue open to the 32-year-old 

Berenson, who has denied wrongdoing.

<p> If the Costa Rica-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights upholds her conviction, 

her only hope of release would be a presidential pardon - something Peru has indicated 

is unlikely.

<p> The court will examine Berenson's case after a decision in her favor by the 

Inter-American Commission in Washington, her lawyer, Jose Luis Sandoval, said. 

''The commission issued a pronouncement in her favor which was sent to the government 

in April,'' Sandoval said. He had no details of when the court could actually 

reopen the case. Legal sources said a final court ruling could take two years.

<p> The Peruvian government, according to a resolution published in the official 

gazette Saturday, has ''taken the decision to take Lori Berenson's case to the 

Inter-American Court of Human Rights.''

<p> It said the government had appointed lawyers ''to defend the Peruvian state 

... with the aim of ... obtaining a resolution favorable to the interests of Peru.''

<p> The government has set aside $182,900 to cover legal costs. The cash will 

come from a fund created by recovering illicit payments made to the corrupt government 

of President Alberto Fujimori, ousted in 2000 in a payoff scandal. Sandoval said 

there would be a full trial in San Jose, Costa Rica, with oral hearings and witnesses, 

culminating in a ruling either to uphold the sentence, order Berenson free, or 

order a retrial. The court cannot reduce her sentence or acquit or convict her, 

he added.

<p> Berenson, who left the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989 and in 

1990 moved to Latin America, was arrested in 1995 under Fujimori's tough antiterrorism 

laws. A military court imprisoned her for life the following year as a leader 

of the Marxist rebel group, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, or MRTA.

<p> The MRTA, along with the Maoist group, Shining Path, battled the state in 

the 1980s and 1990s in a conflict that killed about 30,000. The MRTA is best known 

for a 1996-1997 hostage siege of the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima. 

Berenson's conviction was overturned in 2000 and a civilian retrial ordered, which 

found her guilty of aiding the MRTA in plotting an attack on Congress and imprisoned 

her for 20 years.</p>
