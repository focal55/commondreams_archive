<p>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine&nbsp; - The United States scoffed on Friday at Iraq's 

offer of talks on U.N. arms inspections and renewed its call for the ouster of 

President Saddam Hussein.

<p>White House National Security Council spokesman Sean  McCormack said the United States was demanding completely  "unfettered" inspections of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction  programs.<p>He said Washington would maintain its policy of seeking to  oust the Iraqi leader, calling that a separate issue from the  weapons inspections.<p>"Our policy remains the same. It has been the same since  1995 and that is regime change. ... Everyone understands the  nature of Saddam Hussein and his regime," McCormack said.<p>Secretary of State Colin Powell told reporters traveling  with him on an Asian tour that Iraq had always tried to "find a  way round" U.N. requirements to disarm.<p>"We shouldn't allow the Iraqis to change the goal posts,"  he said, making clear he believed Saddam was trying to stall  for time amid growing speculation of a military strike against  him.<p>"Inspections are not the issue, disarmament is the issue  and making certain that they have no weapons of mass  destruction and they did what they were supposed to do but we  know they haven't," Powell said.<p>In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on  Thursday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri invited chief arms  inspector Hans Blix to Baghdad for talks.<p>U.N. arms experts left Iraq in December 1998 on the eve of  a U.S.-British bombing campaign to punish Baghdad for not  cooperating with the arms experts. Accounting for Iraq's  weapons of mass destruction is key to suspending U.N.  sanctions, imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.<p>Hinting that Iraq might allow inspectors back, Sabri said  the talks could "establish a solid basis" for the next stage of  monitoring and inspection activities.<p>The Iraqi letter came in a week that President Bush  repeated his commitment to a "regime change" in Iraq and his  determination to look at "all options ... all tools" to oust  the Iraqi leader.<p>'NO DISCUSSION NECESSARY'<p>Referring to Iraq's invitation for talks, McCormack, on his  way to join Bush in Kennebunkport said: "It should be a very  short discussion. What he (Saddam) should say is, 'Yes, I  accept any time, anywhere, any place unfettered inspections."'<p>"There's no discussion necessary. Saddam Hussein needs to  live up to the terms of the agreement he signed in 1991,"  McCormack said, referring to agreements calling for the end of  Iraqi weapon programs. "He has failed to live up to that. ...  Inspections were a means to an end, they were never an end in  and of themselves."<p>A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said,  "I think we've all seen this story line before ... of feints  and false promises."<p>Separately, a U.S. official said the Bush administration  believed there was "credible evidence" that Sept. 11 hijacker  Mohammed Atta met five months earlier with an Iraqi agent in  Prague, Czech Republic.<p>The FBI and the CIA have doubts there was such a meeting.  Iraqi officials have denied any involvement in the Sept. 11  plot.<p>Like the United States, Britain was skeptical of the Iraqi  offer for talks. In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said:  "Saddam has a long history of playing games. As his track  record shows, he does not deliver."<p>Russia, a determined opponent of military action against  Iraq, welcomed Baghdad's invitation as an important step toward  resolving the impasse peacefully.<p>But White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said, "It's time  for action, not discussions."

<p>Iraq maintains it has complied with U.N. weapons requirements.
