<p>WASHINGTON — As the Bush administration considers its military options for 

deposing Saddam Hussein, senior administration and Pentagon officials say they 

are exploring a new if risky approach: take Baghdad and one or two key command 

centers and weapons depots first, in hopes of cutting off the country's leadership 

and causing a quick collapse of the government.</p>

<P> The "inside-out" approach, as some call this Baghdad-first option, would capitalize 

on the American military's ability to strike over long distances, maneuvering 

forces to envelop a large target. Those advocating that plan say it reflects a 

strong desire to find a strategy that would not require a full quarter-million 

American troops, yet hits hard enough to succeed. One important aim would be to 

disrupt Iraq's ability to order the use of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<P> The advantages and risks of strikes aimed deep inside the country and radiating 

outward are now under active discussion, according to senior administration and 

Defense Department officials. No formal plan has yet been presented to President 

Bush or the senior members of his national security team, and several officials 

cautioned that a number of alternatives were still under consideration. </p>

<P> The inside-out ideas are essentially the reverse of the American strategy 

in the Persian Gulf war of 1991, which dislodged Mr. Hussein's occupying army 

from Kuwait.</p>

<P> The aim would be to kill or isolate Mr. Hussein and to pre-empt Iraq's use 

of weapons of mass destruction, whether against an incoming force, front-line 

allies or Israel. Those weapons are the wild card in all the outlines of a military 

confrontation. </p>

<P> Officials say it may be possible to paralyze an Iraqi command-and-control 

system that is highly centralized and authoritarian. Under such a system, midlevel 

officers are not taught to improvise, should they be cut off from commanders. 

It is also possible that those midlevel officers, if they fear that Mr. Hussein 

has been killed, would not bother to fire weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<P> If that can be accomplished with a smaller invasion force than the 250,000 

troops suggested in early drafts, the approach could appeal to skittish gulf allies 

whose bases would be required for a war.</p>

<P> Those states are quietly advocating the quickest and smallest military operation 

possible, to lessen anti-American protests on their streets. In that sense, the 

war planning includes the political dimension of trying to tip reluctant allies 

into supporting, tacitly at least, the operation.</p>

<P> Something nearer the 250,000 figure might have to be deployed to the region 

anyway, to make sure that any forces that drop into Baghdad do not become isolated 

or surrounded, bereft of a land line providing military support, food and ammunition.</p>

<P> The Defense Department deputy spokesman, Bryan Whitman, said the Pentagon 

would have no comment on potential military plans for Iraq.</p>

<P> But it is clear that the debate over whether and how to dislodge Mr. Hussein 

is gaining speed within the administration and on Capitol Hill.</p>

<P> "There is a divergence of views on how can one best diminish the prospect 

that he uses weapons of mass destruction, with any efficacy," said Senator Joseph 

R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who stressed 

that he had not been briefed on administration thinking.</p>

<P> Senator Biden, who is preparing to hold hearings on Iraq this week, said in 

an interview: "That is where the argument for an inside-out operation gains credibility. 

There is a diminished possibility that he will use chemical or biological weapons."</p>

<P> In May, President Bush was presented with concepts that advocated a major 

invasion, but some senior officials are said to view the plan as unimaginative.</p>

<P> In contrast, a key national security aide, retired Gen. Wayne A. Downing, 

had reportedly argued that Mr. Hussein could be toppled with minimal numbers of 

Americans on the ground, provided they were backed up by huge airstrikes. However, 

senior officials concluded that a proxy battle would be insufficient to bring 

a change in power in Iraq, and General Downing left the White House last month.</p>

<P> "It's easy to rule out both ends of the spectrum," one senior Defense Department 

official said. "We are looking at the three or four options in between."</p>

<P> No timetable has been set for military action, and if President Bush decides 

to go ahead, his aides say, he will have to make a public, convincing case about 

why Mr. Hussein poses an intolerable threat to the United States and its allies. 

Some members of Congress, including conservative Republicans, are beginning to 

urge Mr. Bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing American forces 

to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the United States. </p>

<P> "The time will come to do all of that," a senior administration official said 

in an interview on Friday. "And no one is opposed to doing it." </p>

<P> A plan to immobilize the Iraqi leadership would draw from lessons learned 

on maneuver warfare in the invasion of Panama, which Dick Cheney and Colin L. 

Powell directed, and on the surprise Inchon Sea landing in Korea in 1951, according 

to officials who monitor the internal debate. </p>

<P> "To the degree that you can have strategic and, especially, tactical surprise 

in any military operation, that is important," said another senior Defense Department 

official. President Bush has put Mr. Hussein on direct notice that regime change 

is American policy. But just as the Taliban and Al Qaeda had little doubt that 

the United States would respond to the attacks of Sept. 11, the timing and tactics 

achieved a great measure of surprise, military officials said. </p>

<P> Baghdad is ringed by Mr. Hussein's most elite forces, and the city itself 

is filled with antiaircraft batteries. While officials declined to discuss details 

of any new operation in detail, it would probably include intense air attacks 

followed by a combined airborne and ground assault on strategic targets. </p>

<P> Senior administration and Pentagon officials said they expected that a military 

action against Iraq would be mostly American-run, with Britain the only partner 

contributing significant forces. But cooperation from allies in the region — particularly 

in the form of bases — would be essential.</p>

<P> Persian Gulf governments have significant areas of agreement with Mr. Bush's 

policy, and equally important areas of concern, according to senior officials, 

diplomats and military officers from the region. </p>

<P> Those nations have issued warnings against American military action, have 

called for dialogue with Baghdad and they identified with Iraq at the Arab League 

summit meeting last spring, yet gulf state officials said Mr. Hussein, while contained 

today, remained a threat.</p>

<P> "We don't like Saddam," said one senior gulf diplomat. "We don't believe he 

is a peaceful neighbor." </p>

<P> To win support of those strategic allies, America has to ensure that next 

time, the military operation will take down Mr. Hussein once and for all, officials 

from the region say. </p>

<P> "Any war against Iraq has to be successful," said another senior gulf official. 

"America has to nail down the objective of the war." </p>

<P> Officials from those nations are equally adamant that any military action 

should be the minimum necessary to bring about a change in rule. "The worst scenario 

from our view would be a big war by air and land and with lots of bombs and civilian 

casualties," said a gulf official.</p>

<P> In any case, the gulf nations first want the United States to demonstrate 

some progress in the crisis between the Palestinians and Israelis before opening 

yet another front in the region, after Afghanistan.</p>

<P> In concentrating its attention on an air campaign and ground action, the military 

and administration officials have been weighing troop deployments ranging from 

70,000 to 250,000. The new plan under discussion could conceivably be carried 

out at the lower range of that spectrum.</p>

<P> Pentagon officials warn that tracking Mr. Hussein with any certainty is difficult 

if not impossible, as shown by the global manhunt now under way for Osama bin 

Laden. Likewise, despite a decade of intense scrutiny of Iraq's missile program 

and its efforts to field biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, America's knowledge 

of hidden labs, storage areas and mobile missile sites is still spotty.</p>

<P> Iraq is thought to possess a small number of Scud missiles — "A handful. A 

couple of handfuls, maybe," according to a senior Defense Department official. 

Senior military officials express confidence that the United States would do a 

much better job hunting mobile Scuds next time than they did during the gulf war, 

because of coverage from satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. </p>

<P> Iraq has studied ways to counter stealth aircraft and improve its tracking 

and jamming abilities. But for the most part, "They have mostly not used or tried 

to use air defenses very effectively," said another senior Pentagon official.</p>
