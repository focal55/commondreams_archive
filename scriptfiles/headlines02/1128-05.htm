<p>NEW YORK - President Bush called him ''one of our nation's most accomplished 

and respected public servants,'' but the selection of Henry Kissinger to chair 

the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks left critics 

shaking their heads in wonder.

Christopher Hitchens, author of ''The Trial of Henry Kissinger,'' a widely publicized 

book that accuses Kissinger of war crimes for his role in the bombing of Cambodia 

and the coup in Chile, offered a harsh appraisal. 

<P> ''The Bush administration did not want an objective inquiry into the disastrous 

intelligence failures,'' Hitchens said yesterday, `'and having an inquiry chaired 

by Henry Kissinger is the next best thing.'' 

<P> Kissinger is regarded by many as a distinguished author, academic, and statesman. 

''He's also spent much of his life in New York, feels deeply the loss that came 

to that city and to our country,'' Bush said. ''Dr. Kissinger will bring broad 

experience, clear thinking, and careful judgment to this important task.'' 

<P> But when Scott Armstrong, founder of the National Security Archive and a former 

staff member of Senate Watergate committee was told of yesterday's news, he laughed 

for a solid minute. 

<P> Armstrong's disbelief stemmed from two considerations. First, Kissinger, 79, 

no longer commands the universal respect he enjoyed when he invented shuttle-diplomacy 

in the Middle East, opened a corridor to China as President Nixon's national security 

adviser, and won a Nobel Peace Prize for what seemed at the time to be achievements 

toward ending the war in Vietnam. 

<P> Second, Armstrong wonders whether, as head of Kissinger Associates, an international 

consulting firm, has a conflict of interest in even accepting the appointment. 

<P> Although this client list has never been made public - and an assistant for 

Kissinger repeated in a phone conversation yesterday that its contents are private 

- reports have widely circulated that it includes Persian Gulf states, oil companies, 

and transportation firms. 

<P> ''He has so many clients whose interests are so completely tied up in the 

results of this investigation,'' Armstrong said. ''The minute you start talking 

about clerics in Saudi Arabia, it's in no way in the interests of his clients 

for the whole truth to be told.'' 

<P> Speaking briefly with reporters at the White House, Kissinger said his panel 

is ''under no restrictions, and we will accept no restrictions,'' in carrying 

out the investigation. 

<P> He promised to meet regularly with victims' families. ''To the families concerned, 

there's nothing that can be done about the losses they've suffered,'' he said. 

''But everything must be done to avoid that such a tragedy can occur again.'' 

<P> But Hitchens called Kissinger ''a guy who's had two careers of massive deception. 

First as an official lying to Congress about Cambodia; then as the author of three 

volumes of memoirs, in which he falsified major matters, including negotiations 

on Vietnam, Angola, and collusion with Indonesia on East Timor - this is fact, 

not assertion, as attested by recently declassified documents. 

<P> ''Now to be offered a third career as a cover-up artist,'' Hitchens said, 

''is truly scandalous.'' 

<P> Jesse Incao, an assistant to Kissinger, said yesterday that the former diplomat 

was unavailable for comments or interviews yesterday. 

<P> Kissinger has disparaged both Hitchens and his accusations on the few occasions 

when he has been prompted to comment on them. Former US Ambassador Jack F. Matlock 

Jr. has also attacked Hitchens's book, in the New York Times Book Review, as a 

''intemperate diatribe'' and ''a propaganda screed.'' 

<P> The Kissinger appointment received favorable notice from some Democrats yesterday. 

Senator Bob Graham of Florida, the ranking member of the Senate Select Committee 

on Intelligence, echoed Bush's statement, ''Henry Kissinger brings a great depth 

of experience, wisdom, and respect to the chairmanship of the independent commission.'' 

Graham added, ''I have had the opportunity to know Dr. Kissinger for many years 

and we have had an excellent relationship.'' 

<P> Kissinger chaired a presidential commission once before, in 1984, when Ronald 

Reagan appointed him to a panel on US policy toward Central America. The panel 

recommended an $8 billion foreign aid program, including ''significantly increased'' 

military assistance to El Salvador, for helping to ward off what were then perceived 

as threats from Cuba and the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. 

<P> Reagan did not completely follow the urgings on economic aid, but did use 

the Kissinger report as a further rationale for stepped-up arms shipments to the 

''contras,'' who were waging a guerrilla war to topple the Sandanistas. 

<P> News accounts from the time report that Reagan named Kissinger to the panel 

because he was the nation's most widely respected authority on foreign policy. 

<P> Although Kissinger still has his defenders and remains a sought-after figure 

for television talk shows and newspaper Op-Ed pages, he is now also the object 

of controversy, brought on by disclosures and lawsuits in the decades since he 

was in office. 

<P> Hitchens is not the only person who has raised questions about Kissinger's 

involvement with the 1973 coup in Chile. In May 2001, a French court subpoenaed 

Kissinger to testify in connection with a lawsuit brought by relatives of five 

French citizens who ''disappeared'' during Augusto Pinochet's coup. Kissinger, 

who was in Paris at the time, had no legal obligation to respond to the subpoena, 

and did not. 

<P> Armstrong raises another issue. When Kissinger left government in 1976, he 

took thousands of State Department documents, to help him write his memoirs, and 

has not returned many of them, despite official urgings. 

<P> ''He's a man with a private sense of history,'' Armstrong said. ''He does 

not have a credible approach to assuring the public that he's interested in getting 

to the bottom of things or that he will do so through an open process. If he discovers 

10 percent more than what we already know, people will assume there's 50 percent 

more behind the scenes. If he discovers 50 percent more, people will assume the 

story's completely on its head.'' 

<P> Walter Isaacson, chairman of CNN and author of a Kissinger biography, told 

National Public Radio yesterday that Kissinger might be inclined to go after the 

CIA and FBI for faulty intelligence analysis. 

<P> ''He's particularly good at wanting to make sure intelligence gets put in 

an analytical framework. He got impatient with those who refused to do so.'' However, 

Isaacson added, ''He has an intuitive feel for how foreign policy works, though 

not quite the same intuitive feel for the workings of an open democracy.''
