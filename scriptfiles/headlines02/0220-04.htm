Gay rights organizations in Alabama and Washington called yesterday for the resignation of Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, who wrote in a child- custody opinion issued on Friday that homosexuality was considered "abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature's God."

<P> Chief Justice Moore, who was championed by the religious right as a lower court judge after he hung a copy of the Ten Commandments on his courtroom wall, argued in a concurring opinion that homosexuality was an "inherent evil against which children must be protected." He said homosexuals were "presumptively unfit to have custody of minor children under the established laws of this state." </P>

<P> The case concerned a custody battle between a father of three children and his former wife, a lesbian.</P>

<P> Two groups in Alabama that promote equal rights for gays, the <a href="http://members.aol.com/galaa1/index1.html">Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Alabama</a> and <a href="http://www.equalitybeginsathome.homestead.com/" target="_new">Equality Begins at Home of Central Alabama</a>, asked Chief Justice Moore to leave the bench. </P>

<P> "He has shown there is no way he can fairly judge any cases involving gay and lesbian citizens of Alabama or their family and friends," Ken E. Baker, chairman of Equality Begins at Home, said in Montgomery.</P>

<P> The executive director of the <a href="http://www.ngltf.org" target="_new">National Gay and Lesbian Task Force</a>, Lorri L. Jean, said: "It is appalling to see that blatant bigotry and unrepentant ignorance reign supreme in Alabama's highest court. Chief Justice Moore has decreed that his personal religious beliefs will now be the law of the land in Alabama. This violates the constitutional mandate of separation of church and state, and it renders him unfit to serve as a judge." </P>

<P> State Representative, Alvin Holmes, Democrat of Montgomery, said he would ask the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission to examine Chief Justice Moore's opinion to see whether he should be removed. Mr. Holmes maintained that Chief Justice Moore had violated judicial canons that require a judge to "avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute" and to "not allow his family, social or other relationships to influence his judicial conduct or judgment."</P>

<P> A spokesman for Chief Justice Moore, who was elected in 2000, did not return a call for comment.</P>

<P> Chief Justice Moore wrote his opinion in concurrence with a 9-to-0 ruling by the Supreme Court that awarded primary physical custody of the children to their father over their lesbian mother. The decision, written by another justice, was based more on procedural issues than on the court's view of the mother's homosexuality and its relationship to her abilities as a parent. Indeed, the consensus opinion barely mentioned the mother's sexual orientation.</P>

<P> That made it all the more striking that Chief Justice Moore wrote a long and heavily footnoted essay about homosexuality and his view of its effects on children. </P>

<P> Mr. Baker said he considered the chief justice's words as an invitation to violence. He noted that Tuesday was the third anniversary of the beating death of Billy Jack Gaither, a gay Alabamian who was bludgeoned and burned by two men who confessed that they had been incited by Mr. Gaither's homosexuality. </P>

<P> "He knows the power of words like `inherently evil,' " Mr. Baker said of Chief Justice Moore. "All he didn't do was hand out the rope." </P>
