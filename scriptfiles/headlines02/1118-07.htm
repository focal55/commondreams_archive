<p>Roberto Hernandez remembers looking out the window of his San Ysidro elementary 

classroom and seeing the Border Patrol chasing people "who look like me" across 

the playground. 

<P>When he got older, he was often stopped by the Border Patrol near his San Diego 

County home, even though he had a green card. 

<P>"The military checkpoints are much worse in Palestine," he says, "but for me 

there is a natural link there."

</table>These days, Hernandez's strong feelings about the Israeli-Palestinian quagmire 

have gotten him in big trouble at his school, UC Berkeley. 

<P>Hernandez was one of 79 protesters arrested during an April 9 demonstration 

held by the Students for Justice in Palestine, as part of a campaign to force 

the university to divest from companies with business ties to Israel. 

<P>While the Alameda County District Attorney's office did not file criminal charges 

against those arrested, the university is pursuing campus disciplinary charges 

against Hernandez and 31 other students. 

<P>Hernandez will face a campus hearing Wednesday -- a battle that students characterize 

as a free speech issue but one that the university considers a simple matter of 

protecting other students' rights to an education. 

<P>The university has put a hold on Hernandez's degree, which is preventing him 

from officially graduating and enrolling in his graduate program. That means he 

isn't a student and cannot collect the fellowship he was relying on to pay tuition 

and living expenses. 

<P>"Everything in my life, my politics, is shaped and changed by the border," 

said Hernandez, 23, who grew up as a Mexican citizen just seven blocks from the 

U.S.-Mexican border. 

<P>From one perspective, Roberto Hernandez personifies the traditional American 

success story. His parents are poor immigrants from Guadalajara and Chiapas who 

have little education. 

<P>But he made it to UC Berkeley and excelled throughout his undergraduate years, 

getting involved in the campus community, and earning a campus fellowship and 

a spot in Berkeley's doctoral program in ethnic studies. 

<P>University officials paint quite a different portrait: a rabble-rouser who 

attends virtually every campus protest and who jeopardized his future by participating 

in a takeover of Wheeler Hall last spring. 

<P>Hernandez, they say, not only defied the rules by occupying a campus building 

but also bit a campus police officer while he was being arrested. 

<P>And they say that Hernandez and the other students arrested were warned repeatedly 

against disrupting the "academic mission" of the campus and that they have a right 

to pursue disciplinary charges dealing with the campus code of conduct. 

<P>UC administrators are seeking up to a year's suspension for each of the students. 

<P>But Hernandez, who became a U.S. citizen two years ago, says he is just following 

the values his mother instilled in him. His mother was so proud of her Mexican 

heritage that when she went into labor with him, she traveled to a hospital across 

the border to retain the family's "Mexican nationality." 

<P>Although she had just an eighth-grade education, his mother was always active 

in his school, organizing other parents to improve things and encouraging Hernandez 

and his sister to get involved. 

<P>"My mom brought me up to be involved in the schools," he said, "but it became 

larger than that." 

<P>He became politicized at age 13, when he got swept up in his first "real demonstration," 

a 1992 protest of the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' 

"discovery" of America. 

<P>"It was so huge, and it was beautiful. Five thousand people coming together 

to say no, to take a stand," he said. "That was the beginning for me. It had never 

really clicked for me before. Until that point, I was confused and full of rage, 

but I didn't know how to channel it." 

<P>He began protesting police and Border Patrol brutality and providing support 

and security to the Pastors for Peace caravans headed with food and supplies to 

Cuba. 

<P>In ninth grade, he wrote a paper on what it means to be an American and received 

an F for writing of America as a continent, including Mexico. He then joined MEChA, 

a Chicano student group, for support. 

<P>He was involved in the campaign against Proposition 187, organizing student 

walkouts to protest the measure to deprive undocumented workers of education and 

health and welfare services. (The measure was approved but has since been halted 

by the courts.) 

<P>From then on, he was active on every state proposition affecting minorities, 

including Proposition 209, which eliminated the use of race in university admissions. 

<P>"I think back now not in terms of time, but in terms of propositions," he said. 

<P>He was admitted to UC Berkeley in the last year that affirmative action was 

in place and isn't ashamed to say he probably benefited from the use of racial 

preferences. 

<P>"Affirmative action only opens the door," he said. "We have to work our a-- 

off and earn our degree." 

<P>His apartment is one of an intellectually and politically engaged student, 

with a bed crowded into the corner of a tiny room filled with eight towering bookshelves 

packed with books, mostly about minority issues. The walls are papered with Mexican 

flags, posters of Che Guevara and announcements of political demonstrations. 

<P>"People know of my place here as a mini-Chicano resource center," Hernandez 

said. "I don't have formal library cards, but people do come check out books here." 

<P>Even in his academic life at UC Berkeley, he focused on political issues that 

arose from his upbringing. He has researched the social, political and cultural 

aspects of the border and the functionality of borders internationally. 

<P>Hernandez admits he is involved in a lot of campus political actions but says 

it is because he has been frustrated every time he has tried to work within the 

system. He served as a student senator on campus but found his agenda thwarted 

by politics and partisanship, he said. 

<P>"I try these other formal means of enacting change, but a lot of times we came 

up against these roadblocks," he said. 

<P>Hernandez has been arrested before, during a September 2001 protest of a Daily 

Californian cartoon that many considered racist and anti-Muslim. The charges were 

dropped. 

<P>And he was involved in the highly publicized 1999 demonstrations, where students 

demanded increased support for the ethnic studies program by fasting and camping 

outside Chancellor Robert Berdahl's office. 

<P>But he says his participation is always peaceful. He says the university is 

targeting him because he is so politically active. 

<P>Hernandez's professors -- and even a University of California regent who knows 

him -- believe the university is overreacting to this latest incident because 

of political pressures that label any criticism of Israel as anti- Semitic. 

<P>The entire ethnic studies department signed a letter of support for Hernandez. 

<P>"To see this kid get trashed this way, I just can't see it," said UC Regent 

Alfredo Terrazas, who first met Hernandez in 1998 at a scholarship fund- raising 

event by the Chicano Latino Alumni Club. "For him, it is devastating for his career. 

For the university, it is a shame. And we lose an individual in the Latino community 

who I really believe is going to be a leader." 

<P>Campus spokeswoman Janet Gilmore says that the university's disciplinary charges 

have nothing to do with politics and that pro-Palestinian students who were merely 

protesting and marching around campus have not faced any charges. 

<P>"Clearly, there is not an effort to stop them from exercising their free speech," 

Gilmore said. 

<P>For Hernandez, political dissent could come at a price he was not prepared 

to pay. 

<P>"I wasn't expecting the university to come down on us as hard as they have, 

" he said.</p>
