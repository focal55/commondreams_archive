PARIS  - 

May Day protesters from the far right,

far left and all shades in between took to streets around the

world on Wednesday, some brimming with nationalist fervor,

others calling for peace, jobs and a better environment.

<p>

Chanting "France for the French," at least 10,000

supporters of far-right presidential contender Jean-Marie Le

Pen marched in Paris as a wave of opponents demonstrated

against him across the country ahead of Sunday's runoff

election against President Jacques Chirac.

</font>Marchers young and old carried signs saying "Le Pen for

President" and "Proud to be French" and waved French flags

under the watchful eye of ranks of police ahead of a massive

anti-Le Pen demonstration due later in the day.

<p>

In Germany, one woman was fighting for her life after

violence marking May Day erupted in two leftist districts of

Berlin. It began when a group of around 500 anarchists lit a

large fire on a main street and then pelted the fire brigade

with bottles and stones.

<p>

Police used water cannon against the demonstrators and

hundreds of riot police moved in. Dozens of people suffered

facial cuts from hurled bottles after what was planned as a

peaceful anti-Nazi demonstration.

<p>

Scores of cyclists converged on the U.S. embassy in London,

blocking traffic at the start of anti-pollution and

anti-capitalism protests which drew thousands of demonstrators

to the British capital.

<p>

Amid fears a hard core of activists were bent on violence,

up to 6,000 police flooded the city and businesses boarded up

their windows.

<p>

Almost every country in the world marks May day in one way

or another, and the date is officially recognized by the United

Nations  as International Labour Day.

<p>

WORKERS' RIGHTS

<p>

In other world capitals, trade unionists marched in more

traditional May Day parades, calling for better workers' rights

and an end to violence in the Middle East.

<p>

"Long live international solidarity to Palestine," read a

red banner in Syndagma Square in central Athens, where

thousands of demonstrators had gathered.

<p>

In Australia, where trade unions still have much influence

on government, police arrested dozens of people after scuffles

broke out at a picket to protest against the country's

immigration policies.

<p>

Although thousands of people also staged peaceful labor

demonstrations, union officials expressed concern their cause

was being hijacked by fringe groups.

<p>

"It's the traditional day of international solidarity for

working people. The methods used to promote these other causes

are a concern for us...detract from May Day," said John

Robertson, secretary of the New South Wales Labor Council.

<p>

In warm Italian sunshine some 18,000 people gathered in

front of the basilica of St. Peter's in the Vatican  to listen

to Pope John Paul  deliver his May Day audience.

<p>

"Today is Labour Day... through work, man becomes more

human. But for hard work to allow man to become more human it

must always exist within a social framework," he said.

<p>

COMMUNISTS OVERSHADOWED

<p>

In Moscow, pro-Kremlin parties and trade unions stole the

show from the communists by staging an estimated 140,000-strong

rally on the Red Square -- something the country has not seen

since the Soviet days.

<p>

President Vladimir Putin  welcomed the demonstrators. In a

message that was read out to the well-organized flower-waving

crowd, he hailed the action by the unions and the Kremlin's key

ally United Russia bloc as helping build a better future.

<p>

The communists held a rally nearby to demand an immediate

government resignation.

<p>

Communist authorities in China, which once derided private

enterprise as evil capitalism, showed just how much things had

changed by canonizing entrepreneurs as "model workers,"

awarding special medals to successful businessmen.

<p>

Malaysian authorities arrested 17 people in the capital,

Kuala Lumpur, after labor activists marched through the city

center with banners calling for better rights for plantation

workers.

<p>

"May Day is an act of solidarity, recognized even by the

state," organizers said. "The police action mocks fundamental

rights of workers to assemble peacefully."

<p>

Elsewhere, hundreds of prostitutes took to the streets of

Calcutta in India to press for rights and recognition.
