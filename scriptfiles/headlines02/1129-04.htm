<p>JERUSALEM&#8212;A majority of Palestinians want their police to crack down 

on militants attacking Israel &#8212; a shift that coincides with unprecedented 

criticism from a top Palestinian leader of two years of violence against Israel, 

according to a poll released yesterday.

<P></P>

The poll, by the <a href="http://www.pcpsr.org/" target="_new">Palestinian Center 

for Policy and Survey Research</a>, questioned 1,319 people in personal interviews 

from Nov. 14 to 22 and quoted a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 

points. 

<P></P>

The poll shows Palestinians still strongly favor attacks against Israeli settlers 

and soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza &#8212; lands claimed by the Palestinians 

for their own state &#8212; but that 56 per cent favor steps by the Palestinian 

Authority to stop attacks in Israel. 

<P></P>

And 76 per cent said they backed efforts to reach a mutual ceasefire, a sharp 

rise from the 48 per cent who supported an end to the violence just three months 

ago.

<P></P>

Earlier this week, a top-level Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas said the uprising 

has been a disaster and has led to "complete destruction of everything we built.''

<P></P>

Abbas also implied criticism of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, saying there 

was no reason why the Palestinian Authority should not stop the militants from 

attacking Israel. 

<P></P>

While Arafat's popularity remained unchanged at 35 per cent, the poll showed that 

73 per cent favored selecting a Palestinian prime minister who could take over 

some of Arafat's powers.</p>
