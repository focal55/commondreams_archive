<p>BRATTLEBORO -- Congressman Bernard Sanders said Friday he will introduce legislation to exempt libraries and bookstores from parts of the sweeping USA Patriot Act. 

<P>

Sanders' announcement came as local activists prepared to launch an effort to raise awareness about the Patriot Act and other legislation, which they say threatens Americans' civil liberties.

</table>"The expansion of surveillance, monitoring and investigation into our libraries and book sellers is truly disturbing," Sanders said in a statement Friday released in conjunction with a Burlington press conference. "Libraries and bookstores have always been a source of learning, knowledge and information. The right to read without the fear of government surveillance is a cornerstone of our democracy. I will do everything in my power to ensure that Congress passes legislation that will protect Americans' constitutional rights to read books without fear that someone is violating their right to privacy." 

<P>

The Patriot Act grants law enforcement officials expanded power to access the records of bookstores and libraries when conducting investigations. It also prohibits bookstore owners and librarians from revealing that records have been released. 

<P>

In an interview Friday, Sanders, an independent, said when Congress reconvenes in January he will introduce a bill barring government surveillance of Americans' library borrowing and bookstore purchases. 

<P>

"This is, I think, a major abrogation of civil liberties," Sanders said. "This is a very serious problem, and I'm going to work hard to get this passed." 

<P>

Sanders, who voted against the Patriot Act, said he decided to introduce this legislation after receiving a Nov. 21 letter from Karen Lane, president of the Vermont Library Association. In her letter, Lane urged Sanders to present a bill repealing these provisions in the Patriot Act. 

<P>

"The freedom to read is one of the cornerstones of democracy," Lane stated. "Our professions are founded on principles that encourage the free expression of ideas and the right of a citizenry to access those ideas free of censorship, violations of privacy, or the threat of governmental intrusion." 

<P>

There is no question of the need to protect Americans from the threat of terrorism, Sanders emphasized. But the government had the ability to access these types of records before, he said, though the standards and needs required for obtaining the information were much higher. 

<P>

The Patriot Act creates "a very, very low threshold in terms of the criteria allowing them to (access the information)" said Sanders. 

<P>

The requirement that a librarian cannot reveal that there is an investigation into their records makes the librarian complicit in that investigation, said Sanders. 

<P>

In addition, these provisions of the Patriot Act constitute an unfunded mandate, Sanders said, since they force publicly funded agencies to use resources in order to comply with federal law, but provide no additional money to meet those requirements. 

<P>

When the Patriot Act was passed shortly after Sept. 11, there were no public hearings on the legislation. Sanders said his bill is aimed at raising awareness about these provisions in the Patriot Act, thus gaining broad bipartisan support. 

<P>

It's also critical that citizens understand the act, as well, the congressman said. 

<P>

Public awareness is also the goal of an ad hoc group of local citizens who hope to raise awareness not only about the Patriot Act but also the Homeland Security Act and orders and rules from the executive branch. 

<P>

"We're concerned about the fact that this feels like an infringement on our rights, and we need to go on record as saying this," said Sarah Edwards, a member of the Brattleboro Selectboard who was elected Nov. 5 to the Vermont House as a Progressive. 

<P>

The group has drafted resolutions, similar to those passed in 19 other communities including Burlington and Oakland, Calif., affirming civil rights and calling on local government officials to oppose parts of legislation that violate civil rights and civil liberties. 

<P>

Ellen Kaye, another member of the group, said part of the goal is to educate citizens about the threats to civil liberties. 

<P>

"We feel that an educated community is really going to protect its rights," she said. 

<P>

Kaye said the group will bring the resolutions to Brattleboro and surrounding towns, and will hold a public forum on Jan. 16 with Ben Scotch, director of the Vermont affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union. 

<P>

Edwards said she would bring the resolution to the Brattleboro Selectboard probably sometime in January for the board to consider adopting. 

<P>

Sanders commended the effort. 

<P>

"I think that is exactly the right approach," he said. "My hope is that other communities in Vermont will do it. My hope is the Vermont Legislature will do it." 

<P>

Edwards said she might introduce a resolution to the state Legislature "as a grassroots activist, not necessarily as a legislator."
