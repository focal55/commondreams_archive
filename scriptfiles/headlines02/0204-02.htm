To most people, Antarctica is just a big, dumb block of ice swarming with penguins. 

<P>But to scientists, Antarctica is one of the emerging puzzles of global warming 

research. 

<P>Unfortunately, global warming is such a politically charged, complex issue 

that scientists have had trouble conveying the complexities through the news media. 

They complain that coverage of two recent studies seriously misrepresented the 

meaning and significance of their research. 

<P>One study showed that while other continents are warming, major parts of Antarctica 

are cooling. The other demonstrated that the glacial "ice streams" that feed the 

Ross Ice Shelf in West Antarctica appear to be growing, not shrinking. 

<P>To the scientists involved, the studies suggest that the effects of global 

warming on Antarctica may prove harder to forecast than anticipated. But to their 

dismay, some newspaper editorial writers interpreted the reports as evidence that 

the global warming theory itself is in trouble -- even though that was the furthest 

thing from the scientists' minds. 

<P>The screwup offers a case study in "the difficulties associated with communicating 

information about climate change to the public," said Benjamin Preston, an environmental 

biologist with the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington, Va., who 

wasn't involved with the studies. 

<P>One of the scientists involved in the two studies, Slawek Tulaczyk of the University 

of California at Santa Cruz, said the latest press misinterpretations leave him 

"increasingly frustrated" by sometimes-careless media coverage of the global warming 

issue. 

<P>Tulaczyk and Ian Joughin of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena reported 

in the Jan. 18 issue of Science that the movement of the glacial Ross ice streams 

appears to be slowing, allowing the ice to thicken. </p>

<b>MEDIA ERRORS</b> 

<P>In reporting these and the other findings, most science writers got the story 

about right. Trouble started, though, when the findings were tackled by the newspaper 

staff members who are typically paragons of caution: editorial writers. 

<P>A headline over an editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune minced no words 

about it: "Scientific findings run counter to theory of global warming." The editorial 

sarcastically asked: "Oh dear. What will the doomsayers say now? How will they 

explain away yet two more scientific studies that clearly contradict the global 

warming orthodoxy?" 

<P>Some media mistakenly equated the phenomenon studied by Joughin and Tulaczyk 

-- a change in ice flow rates -- with ice melting rates. The mistake contributed 

to the erroneous belief that the studies constituted, as it were, scientific "tests" 

of the global warming theory. 

<P>For example, a headline in the National Post, a Canadian newspaper, declared: 

"Antarctic ice sheet has stopped melting, study finds." </p>

<b>CLIMATE TRENDS NOT RELATED</b> 

<P>Contrary to some news reports, "the ice-sheet growth that we have documented 

in our study area has absolutely nothing to do with any recent climate trends," 

Tulaczyk declared, emphasizing those words in an e-mail to The Chronicle. 

<P>The thickening of Antarctic ice in certain regions -- especially "Ice Stream 

C" of the Whillans Ice Stream, adjacent to the Ross Ice Shelf -- results from 

unexpectedly complex internal dynamics of the ice itself. 

<P>That the ice-flow changes are unrelated to global warming is illustrated by 

a simple fact: Such changes were occurring long before the Industrial Revolution 

boosted atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases. The area with the greatest 

ice thickening is on an ice stream that stopped flowing about 150 years ago. 

<P>"I keep repeating to journalists that climate science is much like economics. 

Both deal with complex systems," Tulaczyk observed. "Just as a single stock going 

up or down cannot be interpreted as a reliable indicator of economic recovery 

or collapse, we have to accept the occurrence of contradictory trends in the global 

climate." </p>

<b>CONVEYING INFORMATION DIFFICULT</b> 

<P>For news media, the problem is an old one: How can writers convey interesting 

news about subjects like global warming to readers in a simple, easy-to-read way, 

without oversimplifying the complexities and obscuring the uncertainties? There's 

a tendency to take the "latest" results -- which may focus on just a tiny aspect 

of the climate change problem -- and blow them out of proportion. 

<P>In the other recent study, 13 scientists reported in the Jan. 13 issue of Nature 

that while other continents have warmed to record-high temperatures in recent 

years, most of the Antarctic surface has cooled since 1966. 

<P>Some editorial writers assumed that if Antarctica is getting cooler, then maybe 

the whole planet is cooling, too. "Is Another Ice-Age On the Way?" asked an editorial 

in the Rocky Mountain News. 

<P>Contrary to the insinuations, "global warming is real and happening right now," 

declared Peter T. Doran of the University of Illinois at Chicago, lead author 

of the Nature paper. He said the cooling trend in Antarctica appears to be a surprising, 

regional exception to the overall planetary warming -- that's all. 

<P>Doran emphasized: "Our paper does not change the global (temperature) average 

in any significant way. . . . Although we have said that more area of the continent 

is cooling than warming, one just has to look at the paper itself . . . to see 

that it is a close call. </p>

<b>POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS</b> 

<P>"Our analysis suggests that about two-thirds of the main continent has been 

cooling in the last 35 years," Doran said. "But there is one-third of the continent 

that has been warming if you remove the (Antarctic) Peninsula. And with the Peninsula 

included, it shrinks to 58 percent cooling." 

<P>Why is Antarctica cooling at all? One speculation -- still unproven -- is that 

the cooling may result from an unexplained change in wind patterns over Antarctica. 

<P>Normally, winds make Antarctica warmer than it would otherwise be. That's because 

winds force the warm upper air down toward the colder, icy ground and because 

winds compress and warm, like the fabled dry, warm Santa Ana winds of Southern 

California, as they descend the dome-shaped icy slopes of Antarctica. 

<P>In the end, these studies suggest that Antarctica's fate may prove harder to 

forecast than anticipated. But the temperature trends are hardly grounds for throwing 

out all the evidence that the planet as a whole is warming. </p>

<b>GROSS OVERREACTION</b> 

<P>Observes Robert Bindschadler, an Antarctica expert at NASA's Goddard Space 

Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.: "Antarctica is complicated. . . . I am dismayed 

that the two most recent articles have elicited what I would characterize as a 

gross overreaction (by news media) to the facts being reported." (He was not connected 

with the two studies.) 

<P>Likewise, Tulaczyk said, the press coverage of their work made it "clear to 

me how hard it is to bring scientific work to public attention. 

<P>"Our scientific arguments are built on an intricate net of carefully separated 

facts, theories, and hypotheses," he noted. "In our sentences we weigh whether 

to use 'is', 'may be', or 'can' as a verb." Yet such cautious scientific wording 

is often lost when it is translated to newsprint. 

<P>Doran bluntly advises the public: "If you want the facts, you have to go to 

the original scientific peer-reviewed literature, and avoid the broken- telephone 

effect of the popular press."</p>
