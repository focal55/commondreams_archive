<p>The United Nations is likely to throw into disarray America's war plans for 

Iraq by introducing a timetable for weapons inspections that could give Saddam 

Hussein a breathing space of almost 12 months.</p>

<p>The extended timetable, which would allow the inspectors first to deploy in 

Iraq and then to begin and complete their complicated mission, could exhaust the 

patience of Washington, which envisages attacking the country much earlier, probably 

in February. Yesterday the Bush administration asked Congress to endorse the military 

option before the UN makes its move.</p>

<p>President Bush "reserves the right to act in the interests of the United States 

and its friends and allies", his spokesman said.</p>

<p>Such a disavowal of the United Nations by the United States would spell both 

war and diplomatic disaster for the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who helped to 

persuade Washington to bring the crisis back under the UN's umbrella. Britain's 

global influence depends largely on its permanent seat at an effective and respected 

UN Security Council. The organization will be shunted into irrelevance, diplomats 

fear, if President Bush unilaterally goes to war.</p>

<p>Even as envoys scurried in New York to craft a new resolution on Iraq, the 

Pentagon was privately briefing on plans to deploy 250,000 ground troops in the 

country to spearhead an assault aimed at toppling President Saddam and his regime.</p>

<p>Nailing down a schedule for the inspections will be the primary objective of 

the new resolution on Iraq that Britain wants to see passed in the Security Council 

before 30 September. On that date, Hans Blix, the chief weapons inspector, is 

due to start talks with Iraqi officials in Vienna on practical arrangements for 

the return of his teams.</p>

<p>Mr Blix is not expected to be able to begin serious deployment of inspectors 

and their staff before the end of October, a process likely to take two months. 

Thereafter, an existing Security Council text on Iraq &#150; UN Resolution 1284 

&#150; stipulates that inspectors will need 60 more days to decide on what they 

need to do on the ground. The inspections proper would only begin, therefore, 

in early March, and last six months, until the end of August.</p>

<p>Diplomats acknowledge that the process could be shattered at any time if President 

Saddam reneges on the promise made on Monday to give inspectors unfettered or 

unconditional access. Indeed, any snag or hiccup in the process could give Washington 

a pretext to go to war with Iraq. It is for that reason that Britain will try 

to convince doubters in the Council &#150; principally Russia and France &#150; 

that a resolution reinforcing 1284 with new deadlines and demands must be adopted 

soon. Failure to do so would leave President Saddam with greater leeway to manipulate 

the process and increase the likelihood of US aggression.</p> </p>
