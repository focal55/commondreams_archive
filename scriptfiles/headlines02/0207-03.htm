With the U.S. air campaign in Afghanistan largely complete and the 

security situation across the country generally improving, the 

Pentagon is facing closer scrutiny about the extent of civilian 

casualties reported since American bombs started falling in October.



<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human Rights Watch</a>, a privately funded human-rights advocacy group, 

plans to send a team of researchers to Afghanistan next month to try 

to estimate the number of civilians killed during the course of the 

campaign. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a> may do the same after trying 

unsuccessfully to get the Pentagon to disclose details about a number 

of bombings that reportedly killed civilians. And a University of New 

Hampshire professor has made headlines -- and drawn sharp criticism 

-- by publishing a database he says details thousands of civilian 

casualties caused by the air war.



<p>The efforts come in the wake of an investigation opened by U.S. 

commanders into a raid last month that Pentagon officials now 

acknowledge may have resulted in the death of forces friendly to the 

U.S.-backed interim government of Hamid Karzai. In the raid, American 

soldiers killed as many as 18 people in two compounds they believed 

were al Qaeda leadership posts in the village of Hazar Qadam. A 

spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, responsible for operations in 

Afghanistan, said the investigation isn't complete, but more than two 

dozen people U.S. troops seized in the raid were turned over 

Wednesday to Mr. Karzai's government after it was determined they 

aren't Taliban or al Qaeda fighters.



<p>That incident followed a December air strike on a convoy near Khost 

that local Afghans -- and Mr. Karzai -- say killed tribal elders 

loyal to the new government, not Taliban leaders as the Pentagon 

originally claimed. Central Command is still looking into that 

incident. But so far, investigators believe they hit "exactly" what 

they intended to hit, the Central Command spokesman said.



<p>The investigations, spurred by outrage from U.S.-backed Afghan 

factions, have done little to quiet criticism from human-rights 

activists. "While they are undertaking investigations in a number of 

cases, we would hope they would investigate every instance of alleged 

civilian casualties," said Margaret Ladner, a London-based researcher 

who is part of an Amnesty International team looking at alleged 

human-rights violations in Afghanistan. "And we would hope that they 

would make those investigations public."



<p>Defense officials have acknowledged repeatedly that civilians may 

have died as a result of U.S. bombing. "There is no question that we 

have killed and injured people we did not intend to in the course of 

the war," said Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, the top spokesman for 

Central Command, based in Tampa, Fla. But military planners have gone 

to great lengths to "maximize damage [to Taliban and al Qaeda 

targets] and minimize civilian casualties and collateral damage" 

during military operations in Afghanistan, Adm. Quigley said.



<p>The Pentagon also has pointed periodically to the more than 3,000 

civilians killed in the Sept. 11 attacks, which triggered the air 

campaign. The U.S. blames Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist 

network, which enjoyed refuge under Afghanistan's Taliban regime.



<p>Except for a handful of cases, however, the Pentagon has avoided 

addressing specific instances of alleged civilian casualties. A small 

damage-assessment team at Central Command looks into cases where 

credible evidence points to civilian casualties, double-checking 

targeting data and reviewing aerial photography and other 

intelligence, officials say. With few American troops on the ground 

throughout most of the bombing campaign, officials have said it was 

impossible to investigate thoroughly most reports of civilian deaths. 

Now, with thousands of U.S. troops moving more freely across 

Afghanistan, the Pentagon says it is too late to begin 

investigations. "If you can't get there real quick, there's not much 

you are going to learn that you have any confidence in," Adm. Quigley 

said.



<p>Human Rights Watch disagrees. A team of three researchers plans to 

enter Afghanistan early next month to survey sites where civilian 

casualties may have occurred. The team has compiled a database of 

more than 330 alleged incidents across the country. About a third of 

those allegations are considered credible, according to William M. 

Arkin, who will lead the Afghanistan team.



<p>Human Rights Watch is keeping a preliminary tally based on news 

reports, Pentagon briefings and reports from the group's members in 

Pakistan. Group officials privately had estimated the civilian death 

toll at between 100 and 350 early in December, but they won't comment 

on what they now believe the number may be.



<p>One researcher already is saying the civilian death toll from the 

U.S. campaign in Afghanistan may be in the thousands. Marc W. Herold, 

a professor of economics and women's studies at the University of New 

Hampshire, has compiled a database from local and international news 

reports indicating between 3,300 and 3,900 civilians died during the 

Afghanistan campaign. While his study has attracted news-media 

attention, human-rights groups have said it is flawed because it 

relies on second- and third-hand reporting. Mr. Herold defended his 

methodology, however, saying he has spent considerable time sorting 

out conflicting reports and taking into account the biases of many of 

his sources.
