WASHINGTON  - Environmentalists are urging the

Canadian government to fight a lawsuit filed against it by a major

U.S. chemical company under the North American Free Trade

Agreement (NAFTA).

</table>Activists say they worry Canada will cave in to Crompton

Corporation, which has filed suit against the Canadian government

for banning the pesticide lindane. Officials in Ottawa have

capitulated in similar challenges filed under NAFTA's investment

protection provisions, known as Chapter 11, they note. <P>

''Canada must not allow foreign investors to dictate through

Chapter 11 the approach it takes to regulating substances as

dangerous as lindane,'' environmental advocacy groups in Canada,

Europe, Mexico, and the United States say in a letter to Canadian

authorities. <P>

Crompton notified Canadian authorities in November that it would

pursue a 100 million dollar NAFTA claim against Canada for de-

registering lindane for use on Canadian canola crops. <P>

Crompton charges that by banning the pesticide and "failing to

live up to its undertaking to conduct a review of lindane, the

government has taken measures tantamount to expropriation.'' <P>

''There is no scientific basis for banning the use of lindane

product for canola seeds as there is no conclusive scientific

evidence that such action is necessary to protect human health or

the environment,'' its complaint states. <P>

Marc Richard, spokesperson for the Canadian Pesticide Management

Regulatory Agency, says the sides are discussing the issue. Under

NAFTA, Crompton and Ottawa have 90 days to work out a compromise

before the company can move the dispute process further. <P>

Canada, explains Richard, did not ban the use of lindane for

canola directly because of health or environmental concerns.

Rather, it de-registered the use of lindane for canola seed after

it became a trade dispute with the United States, which forbids

the use of the pesticide on canola. 

<P>

In 1998, Washington warned Ottawa it would block imports of crops

treated with pesticides not allowed for use in the United States.

US canola growers, prevented by US law from using the chemical

to treat their seed, had complained that the higher cost of

lindane substitutes gave Canadian growers an unfair competitive

advantage. 

<P>

In response, Canadian authorities, canola growers, and

manufacturers of lindane - including Crompton unit Uniroyal

Chemical - had agreed to phase out lindane, says Richard. 

<P>

While Crompton argues that lindane is safe, the activist <a href="http://www.panna.org/panna/" target="_new">Pesticide

Action Network</a> says lindane is highly toxic and lists the

pesticide as one of the ''dirty dozen'' pesticides. 

<P>

Lindane is considered a persistent organic pollutant, or POP,

because it travels long distances and breaks down extremely

slowly. The documented health effects of lindane include

dizziness, seizures, nervous system damage, immune system damage,

and birth defects. 

<P>

In Europe, all agricultural uses of lindane have been banned. The

US Environmental Protection Agency has called the pesticide a

possible human carcinogen and is currently completing a scientific

review of the chemical. 

<P>

''No government should be forced to import such a toxin,'' says

Kristin Schafer of Pesticide Action Network North America. <P>

The Stockholm Convention on POPs, adopted and signed by 90

countries in May, does not yet cover lindane but discussions are

under way to ban the pesticide. 

<P>

The letter to Canadian authorities from several dozen groups

including Greenpeace and the Washington-based Center for

International Environmental Law, calls on the government to

neither pay the money demanded by Crompton nor settle the lawsuit. 

<P>

''Canada must demonstrate that it will not let narrow corporate

interests dictate the health of its citizens,'' says Angela

Rickman, with Sierra Club Canada. <P>

In July 1998, Ottawa withdrew its ban on the gasoline additive MMT

and paid 13 million dollars in damages to the U.S.-based Ethyl

Corporation, which had brought a NAFTA challenge against the

prohibition. <P>

This time around, the environmental groups also are calling for

action to limit the scope of Chapter 11, saying its provisions

have been used as a ''key offensive strategic tool'' for

corporations to fight laws that interfere with their ability to

make a profit through exports. <P>

''Ambiguities in the provisions of Chapter 11 have been used to

tip the balance of the investor-state mechanism against the

ability of governments to regulate in the public interest,'' says

their letter. <P>

Corporations in each of the three NAFTA countries - Canada,

Mexico, and the United States - have filed at least seven other

cases challenging domestic environmental and health policies. <P>

In 2000, a NAFTA tribunal ruled that Mexico violated the trade

agreement and ordered the government to pay 16.7 million dollars

to the U.S.-based Metalclad corporation. The company had wanted to

open a hazardous waste treatment and disposal site in central

Mexico but local government said the project violated

environmental protection laws. <P>

Another pending claim involves the Canadian-based company

Methanex, which filed against the United States claiming that the

state of California's decision to phase out the use of its

gasoline additive, MTBE, cost the company 970 million dollars. <P>

California's governor, Gray Davis, ordered the use of MTBE halted

by the end of this year after studies revealed unusually high -

and potentially harmful - levels of MTBE in California's drinking

water. <P>

''NAFTA Parties should reopen and renegotiate the provisions of

Chapter 11,'' says the letter, '' to ensure the ability of

national and sub-national governments to protect their citizens

and the environment from toxic substances.''
