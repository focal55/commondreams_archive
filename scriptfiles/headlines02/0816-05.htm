<p>BOGOTÁ, Colombia &#151; Senior U.S. officials have asked President Álvaro Uribe 

to shield U.S. military trainers in Colombia from prosecution by the International 

Criminal Court for any human-rights abuses that may arise in connection with their 

work. 

<P> The request, made Wednesday by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs 

Marc Grossman, is part of a global campaign by the United States to prevent U.S. 

nationals from being subjected to the international court, which the U.S. fears 

could be abused for political purposes. 

<P> The Colombian government hasn't responded. 

<P> The United States tried unsuccessfully to win U.N. Security Council agreement 

to blanket immunity for U.S. personnel and later sought agreements from individual 

nations that are allowed under the treaty setting up the court. The U.N. eventually 

granted immunity for one year to U.S. troops participating in peacekeeping forces. 

<P> Only two countries, Israel and Romania, have agreed to immunity pledges. Yugoslavia 

earlier this week rejected such a request from the United States, which has roughly 

5,000 peacekeepers in the U.N.-administered Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Canada, 

Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland also have shunned such deals. 

<P> After Romania's action, the European Union (EU) asked countries hoping to 

join the EU alliance, of which Romania is one, not to sign such agreements. 

<P> Under anti-terrorism legislation signed by President Bush this month, U.S. 

military aid would be cut to countries that have ratified the treaty, except those 

granted a waiver by the White House.

<P> The issue has special importance for the Colombian government, which formally 

recognized the court Aug. 5. Uribe, who was sworn into office two days later, 

is relying on U.S. aid to help him wage a broader military campaign against leftist 

guerrillas who have been fighting for years to replace the government with a Marxist 

state. 

<P> Colombia's 38-year war is being fueled by drug profits in the security vacuum 

left by a weak central government. The conflict matches the Revolutionary Armed 

Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and a second, smaller Marxist-oriented insurgency 

against the U.S.-backed military and a privately funded paramilitary group that 

fights by its side. Last year, 3,500 people died in the war, most of them civilians. 

<P> Colombia, the third-largest recipient of U.S. military aid, has received nearly 

$2 billion in U.S. assistance in the past two years. The nearly 80 transport helicopters 

and hundreds of U.S. military trainers, among other aid, were initially meant 

to help the Colombian government attack the thriving drug trade.
