<p>NEW YORK -- Every day, the U.S. government is pumping thousands of barrels of oil into subterranean caverns in Texas and Louisiana, building up a national emergency supply that many believe signals one of the preparations for a coming war against Iraq.</P>

<P>Further evidence that an invasion to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is in the works, according to this week's Newsweek magazine, is that munitions factories around the country are running overtime shifts to replace the weapons and bombs that were used up in the war in Afghanistan.</P>

<P>U.S. military advisers, the magazine added, are already in the Middle East, checking out the readiness of runways and roads for a possible invasion force.</P>

<P>Brent Scowcroft, chairman of the President's foreign-intelligence advisory board, is cautioning that a war on Iraq could destabilize the world's biggest oil-exporting region.</P>

<P>&#34;It's a matter of setting your priorities,&#34; he said. &#34;There's no question that Saddam is a problem. He has already launched two wars and spent all the resources he can working on his military. But the President has announced that terrorism is our No. 1 focus.</P>

<P>While the United States could get rid of the Iraqi leader, said Mr. Scowcroft, who served as the national security adviser in the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, it could cause &#34;an explosion in the Middle East. It could turn the whole region into a cauldron and destroy the war on terror.&#34;</P>

<P>There is no firm indication from U.S. President George W. Bush that he will launch such an invasion. U.S. officials and political leaders are increasingly suggesting that Americans should brace for the economic pain, including higher oil prices, that will follow, should a war in Iraq take place.</P>

<P>&#34;We have to tell [Americans] there's going to be a spike in oil prices,&#34; Joseph Biden, the chairman of the Senate foreign-relations committee, said last week, when the possibility of an attack on Iraq was raised. &#34;It may be temporary, it may be long lasting, but there's going to be a spike and it's going to have economic consequences.&#34;</P>

<P>The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- created in the 1970s, after the Arab oil embargo caused energy shortages that undermined the presidency of Jimmy Carter -- currently stands at about 578 million barrels, short of the 700-million-barrel capacity the Bush administration wants to reach by 2005.</P>

<P>When full, the underground storage caverns can supply the United States with about four million barrels a day, about half of U.S. daily imports of crude. If the United States were to invade Iraq, it would likely mean a disruption of Iraqi oil exports, about 700,000 barrels of which are bought by the United States. At that rate, the current U.S. oil reserves would fill the Iraqi gap for more than two years.</P>

<P>&#34;We made a decision some months ago to fill the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its maximum 700-million-barrel total capacity, as a matter of overall energy security,&#34; U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday.</P>

<P>The reserve, however, isn't as huge as it might seem. If an Iraqi war caused 

the oil exports of other gulf states to slow or dry up (a possibility if there 

were internal revolutions, or if Iraq or terrorist groups managed to launch attacks 

at key production facilities), the current U.S. emergency reserve would supply 

enough oil to run the U.S. economy for about 60 days. If it were topped up to 

700 million barrels, there would be, at best, an 80-day supply.</P>
