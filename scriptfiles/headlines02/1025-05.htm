<p>WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union and three other groups sued 

the Bush administration yesterday, demanding information about expanded Justice 

Department surveillance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. 

<P> The private organizations are seeking information about how the government 

is carrying out record-gathering at libraries, bookstores, and Internet service 

providers. The lawsuit was filed almost a year after President Bush signed the 

USA Patriot Act, which widened the government's surveillance power as part of 

the effort to prevent further terrorist attacks. 

<P> The case filed in US District Court alleges the Justice Department has provided 

no information on parts of the Patriot Act that have ''obvious and serious implications 

for individual privacy and the freedom of speech.'' 

<P> The groups on Aug. 21 asked for all policy directives and other guidance that 

the Justice Department and the FBI issued on:

<P> 

<ul>

<li>Obtaining circulation records from libraries, purchase records from bookstores, 

or e-mail records from Internet service providers.</li>

<li>The expanded use of pen registers and trap-and-trace devices. Pen registers 

capture phone numbers dialed on outgoing calls; trap-and-trace devices capture 

numbers identifying incoming calls. </li>

</ul>



<P> The groups are also demanding information about the number of times the Justice 

Department has engaged in various types of surveillance in the past year. The 

Justice Department says such data are classified. 

<P> Other groups joining the suit were the Electronic Privacy Information Center, 

the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, and the Freedom to Read 

Foundation. </p>
