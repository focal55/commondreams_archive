<p>TEHRAN - Tens of thousands of Iranians chanting "Death to America, death to 

George Bush" took to the streets on Friday in an official demonstration of defiance 

against what they view as U.S. interference in Iran's affairs.

<p>Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the rally to  show popular opposition to President Bush's statement last week  voicing support for reform in Iran.<p>Crowds around Tehran University -- the main venue for  Friday prayers in the Iranian capital -- burned an effigy of  Bush with a sign around its neck saying: "I made a mistake."</span>

</table></font>"From the start, we said we want America to change its  arrogant behavior against Iran and accept that Iran is a free,  Muslim, independent country," influential former President  Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani told worshipers who lined the streets  around the university campus.<p>"We tell the Americans to put aside their arrogant  behavior, then this nation could start dialogue with you and  talk to you," said Rafsanjani, a top advisor to Khamenei.<p>Soldiers, civil servants and hordes of women in black  chadors joined the demonstration, but there were also a number  of pro-reform students present.<p>"We don't want the United States' support, we want  reforms," said student Ahmad Ali Aminiha.<p>"SLAP IN THE MOUTH" FOR BUSH<p>The U.S. administration traditionally shies away from  commenting on Iran's internal politics for fear of further  strengthening powerful conservatives in their campaign to  undermine reformists allied to President Mohammad Khatami.<p>Rafsanjani pointed to the tens of thousands at Friday's  rally compared to the roughly 4,000 disaffected youths who  clashed with security forces on the third anniversary of  violent student unrest on July 9.<p>Hard-liners appointed to strong state posts by Khamenei  have blocked Khatami's attempts to reform the Islamic Republic  at every step, leaving many analysts wondering whether the  mild- mannered president is willing or able to challenge them.<p>Khamenei said on Wednesday that Khatami had given Bush a  "slap in the mouth" by condemning his statement on reform.

<p>Bush has branded Iran part of an "axis of evil," enraging Iranian conservatives 

already wary of the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan to the east and now eyeing 

nervously a possible U.S. attack on Iraq to the west.
