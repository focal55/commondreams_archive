<p>MOSCOW -- Russian legislators strongly criticized as "a serious political mistake" the United States' unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. </p>

<p>In a declaration the deputies in Russia's lower-house Duma said that the US withdrawal from the treaty "could deal a severe blow to international security." </p>

<p>They also called for extra measures to ensure Russia's security.</p>

<p>The United States on Thursday formally withdrew from the 1972 ABM treaty in order to develop an anti-missile defence system, which was prohibited by the ABM treaty.</p>

<p>Washington had given advance notice of its decision in December.</p>

<p>Russian Defence Minister Sergey Ivanov on Friday sought to minimise the threat to Russia's security, arguing that the US anti-missile system existed only on paper and that it made no sense to talk about counter-measures at this stage.</p>

<p>The declaration on strategic stability was adopted almost unanimously in the Duma, with 359 votes in favour and one abstention.</p>

<p>Russia had called the ABM treaty a "cornerstone of strategic stability."</p>
