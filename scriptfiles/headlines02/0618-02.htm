<p>Ted Turner, the billionaire founder of CNN, accuses Israel today of engaging 

in "terrorism" against the Palestinians, in comments that threaten to lead to 

a further decline in the news network's already poor relations with the Jewish 

state. 

<P>"Aren't the Israelis and the Palestinians both terrorizing each other?" says 

Turner, who is vice-chairman of AOL Time Warner, which owns CNN, in an exclusive 

interview with the Guardian. 

<P>"The Palestinians are fighting with human suicide bombers, that's all they 

have. The Israelis ... they've got one of the most powerful military machines 

in the world. The Palestinians have nothing. So who are the terrorists? I would 

make a case that both sides are involved in terrorism." 

<P>His remarks were last night condemned by Ariel Sharon's government, which called 

them "stupid". Andrea Levin, director of the American pro-Israeli media watchdog 

Camera, said the comments were a "reprehensible" attempt to "blur the line between 

perpetrator and victim". 

<P>In his first British interview since the September 11 attacks, Mr Turner - 

who broke philanthropic records in 1997 when he donated $1bn to the UN - argues 

that poverty and desperation are the root cause of Palestinian suicide bombings. 

<P>But Daniel Seaman, a spokesman for the Israeli government, said: "My only advice 

to Ted Turner is if people assume you are stupid, it is just best to keep your 

mouth shut rather than open your mouth and confirm everyone in that view." 

<P>Mr Turner also admits that he was wrong to call the September 11 hijackers 

"brave" in a speech in Rhode Island that sparked outrage. "I made an unfortunate 

choice of words," he says, adding that his ownership of the Atlanta Braves baseball 

team meant the word was never far from his mind. "Look, I'm a very good thinker, 

but I sometimes grab the wrong word ... I mean, I don't type my speeches, then 

sit up there and read them off the teleprompter, you know. I wing it." 

<P>Mr Turner is moved to tears at one point in the interview by the "depressing" 

combination of conflicts like that in the Middle East and the state of the environment, 

which he says demands massive global attention - "or, you know ... it's goodbye". 

<P>A senior minister in Yasser Arafat's cabinet told the Guardian he welcomed 

Mr Turner's comments. Many Palestinians complain just as bitterly of a pro-Israeli 

bias in CNN's coverage - mocking it as the "Zionist News Network" - as Israel 

complains of a pro-Palestinian one. 

<P>"I feel it reflects a more consistent approach," said Ghassan Khatib, Mr Arafat's 

newly appointed labor minister and until recently director of the Jerusalem Media 

and Communications Center, a Palestinian media monitoring unit. 

<P>"One of the problems in trying to reduce the violence has been the focus of 

so much international attention on Israeli rather than Palestinian civilian deaths, 

although four times as many Palestinians have been killed." 

<P>CNN has been a punchbag for both sides. A widespread perception of bias among 

some Israelis and US supporters of Israel has prompted several boycotts by pressure 

groups, urging viewers to switch to Rupert Murdoch's Fox News channel. But three 

months ago, in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mr Arafat slammed 

down the phone after accusing her of anti-Palestinian bias. "You are covering 

with these questions the terrorist activities of the Israeli occupation and the 

Israeli crimes," he said. "Be quiet. Be fair. Thank you, bye-bye."</p>
