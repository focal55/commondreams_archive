<p> HALIFAX &#8212; The world has betrayed Afghanistan by forgetting key promises 

made to the war-ravaged nation, says Afghanistan's new ambassador to Canada.

<P></P>

"The money that was promised: this is life, this (is) food, this is education, 

this is health care," Abdul Jalil Jamily told reporters here during a diplomatic 

conference.

<P></P>

"All the aspects of lives will be stopped (without it). The people of Afghanistan 

&#8212; for education, to support a family, to feed them &#8212; will be stopped."

<P></P>

Jamily said that the United States and its allies promised $3.8 billion to Afghanistan 

over three years in connection with the war on terrorism, but that barely 20 per 

cent of that aid has been delivered.

<P></P>

Without the money, he said, the stability of the country could be at stake.

<P></P>

"Politically, the government situation will be worse because people are waiting 

for the government ... to serve the people. But the promises not coming in, so 

the government of Afghanistan cannot do something for the people because the government, 

like the people, is poor."

<P></P>

Speaking to the gathering of international diplomats, Jamily made an impassioned 

plea for help from Canada in pressuring the world to live up to its $3.8 billion 

pledge, saying his president and foreign minister have been travelling the world 

with the same message.

<P></P>

"I hope that you will not take so long that the Afghan people will go further 

and further (down)," he said.

<P></P>

"(I hope) it will be everything okay."

<P></P>

Jamily also warned against the dangers of war against Iraq, saying his country 

learned through hard experience to avoid war.

<P></P>

"As much as we suffered in the war, we know war is not the key point," he said 

when asked if the United States should go to war to disarm Iraq.

<P></P>

"The best way is to go for discussion to solve problems, not to suffer. The people, 

the ladies, the children, will suffer more. They will be tortured and killed. 

The best way is not to go straight for the war (but to do) ... as much we can 

to stop the war."

<P></P>

Jamily arrived in Canada on Sept. 16. He said he is the first ambassador ever 

sent to Canada from Afghanistan.

<P></P>

He praised the Canadian effort in his homeland, saying Canadian soldiers stationed 

in Kabul have fought and worked hard for his country. He also lauded the welcome 

he received in this country.

<P></P>

"From the first day when I stepped on the beautiful ground of Canada to now, I 

feel the warmest friendship," he said.</p>
