            <p>MIDDLEBURY — Presidential Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was welcomed 

              back to Middlebury College Sunday with an alumni achievement award 

              and standing ovations inside the college chapel, and large and loud 

              protests outside. </p>

            <p>Fleischer’s presence on campus sparked a protest march through 

              downtown Middlebury that brought opponents of the Bush administration’s 

              policy on Iraq from all over Vermont and beyond. By a sideline count, 

              about 880 people wended their way along Main Street and up the hill 

              to Mead Chapel, Middlebury College’s largest gathering space. </p>

            <p>There, they were joined by hundreds of college students to form 

              a crowd that sang and chanted and shouted slogans before, during 

              and after Fleischer’s award and speech on “The Presidency and the 

              Press.” </p>

            <p>Ben Gore, a Middlebury College junior who has been active in the 

              local group, United for Peace, said his group’s count of the people 

              outside Mead Chapel reached 1,500. </p>

            <p>“We were expecting maybe 500, which I thought was optimistic,” 

              Gore said. “This is beyond belief.” </p>

            <p>Before Sunday night, Gore wondered whether a protest movement could 

              have a practical effect on American policies on Iraq. </p>

            <p>“With 1,500 people from all across the economic and age spectrum 

              showing up at a little town in the middle of Vermont, I think it’s 

              practical,” he said. </p>

            <p>One group of three protesters, dressed as cows, said they were 

              actually commercial fishermen from Washington state. They learned 

              about the protest from friends in Middlebury and thought it important 

              enough to come, said one of those carrying the sign “We Need An 

              Udder President.” </p>

            <p>But inside Mead Chapel, a very different atmosphere prevailed. 

              Partly that was from the presence of many staunch Republicans, among 

              them congressional candidate William Meub. </p>

            <p>But also, it reflected college president John McCardell’s firm 

              insistence on civil discourse that reflected all points of view. 

            </p>

            <p>Fleischer deserved his turn, McCardell said, just as the college 

              had previously heard from others, including Scott Ritter, the former 

              Iraq weapons inspection team head who opposes the war. </p>

            <p>A college must further the “sifting and winnowing by which truth 

              can be found,” McCardell said. That implied not only the freedom 

              to speak, but also the freedom to listen, he said — a point that 

              seemed supported as the great majority of listeners ignored hisses, 

              shouts of “Shame” and bouts of yelling. </p>

            <p>Fleischer said the position of press secretary, which serves both 

              the president and the press, is one of those institutions that makes 

              American democracy possible. It’s a demanding task, he said, in 

              an environment in which casual remarks like one about getting rid 

              of Saddam Hussein perhaps costing no more than one bullet can become 

              major incidents in themselves. </p>

            <p>Fleischer said, “That isn’t a statement of administration policy,” 

              which does not support assassination. His poorly chosen words were 

              only meant to suggest that the people of Iraq could themselves change 

              their government, and Saddam Hussein would not be much missed if 

              they did. </p>

            <p>Fleischer insisted that Bush has by no means made up his mind to 

              start a war. Just as President Kennedy’s tough stance on Russian 

              missiles in Cuba made it unnecessary to make a pre-emptive attack 

              there, Bush’s stance is meant to avoid a pre-emptive attack rather 

              than start one, he said. </p>

            <p>Asked about American policy in regard to the Israelis and Palestinians 

              — a touchpoint for attitudes throughout the Islamic world including 

              Iraq — Fleischer pointed out that Bush had come out in favor of 

              a Palestinian state. He promised that “very interesting things” 

              would soon be coming out in regard to the Palestinian Authority, 

              which Israel has said has failed to come to terms with terrorism 

              under Yasser Arafat. </p>

            <p>As for alleged popular discontent with Bush economic policies, 

              he said the actual polls show “the country is very evenly split.” 

              He recalled that when he left Middlebury College in 1982, for a 

              succession of positions as a Republican spokesman, the unemployment 

              rate had been 10.8 percent, rather than the 5.6 percent some people 

              complain about today. </p>

            <p>But Fleischer did little to convince his opponents. </p>

            <p>Jozef Hand-Boniakowski of Wells, a leader in Green Mountain Veterans 

              for Peace, said it was hard to make comparisons with the Vietnam 

              era, but there was definitely a strong popular movement in progress.</p>
