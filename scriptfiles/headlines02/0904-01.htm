<p> JOHANNESBURG - Protesters jeered Secretary of State Colin Powell on the Earth 

Summit's final day Wednesday, accusing Washington of blocking meaningful action 

in a summit blueprint to help the poor and save the planet.

</table>Many governments gave a muted welcome to the summit plan  meant to attack global problems from AIDS to depleted fish  stocks, which was agreed in overnight talks by almost 200  states at the 10-day World Summit on Sustainable Development.<p>Many environmentalists branded it a waste of time and a  sell-out to business interests favored by President Bush, who  did not attend.<p>Even U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that people's  expectations had been too high.<p>Hecklers chanting "Shame on Bush" twice interrupted Powell  as he defended U.S. policies from criticisms that the world's  richest country and biggest polluter does not really care.<p>"Betrayed by governments," read a banner held up by the  protesters, most of whom appeared to be Americans.<p>Seven of them were hustled out by guards from the main  summit hall in Johannesburg as they whistled and booed. Most of  the 100 world leaders who had attended the summit had already  left.<p>"Thank you, I have now heard you. I ask that you hear me,"  Powell replied, breaking off from his prepared speech as South  African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chairing the  meeting, banged a gavel more than a dozen times in disapproval.<p>Powell was first jeered after talking about famine in  southern Africa and singling out Zimbabwe for criticism.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="350">

</table></font>BOOED<p>He was booed again when he said Washington was taking firm  action to combat global warming.<p>Bush, an ally of the oil, coal and logging industries, has  been widely criticized for rejecting the Kyoto pact meant to  fight global warming. Scientists say emissions of greenhouse  gases from burning oil and coal are raising temperatures.<p>The United States denies the charge and has used the summit  to unveil dozens of projects with business that aim to clean up  the planet.<p>"We have plans to end the despair and offer hope. Now is  the time to put those plans into action to expand the circle of  development to all God's children," Powell said.<p>His spokesman said Powell was unruffled by the protests and  was mobbed by well-wishers outside the hall.<p>Activists slammed the summit for setting few firm targets  and for failing to raise aid. Some staged a walkout of the  tightly guarded conference center in protest Wednesday.<p>"The reaction to Colin Powell's speech is a very accurate  reflection of the anger of non-governmental organizations for  the role played by the United States at this conference," said  Remi Parmentier, political director of Greenpeace.<p>"We're proud to be from America but embarrassed by American  policies," said Michael Brune of the Rainforest Action Network.<p>New targets set Wednesday include halving by 2014 the 2.4  billion people without sanitation in the Third World --  minimizing harmful effects from chemicals production by 2020  and a pledge to halt the decline in fish stocks by 2015.<p>But they include scant fresh cash. Current aid from rich  nations totals about $54 billion a year -- or $67 for each of  their citizens. The United Nations reckons that goals like  halving poverty by 2015 could be solved if it were doubled.<p>NO MIRACLES<p>"We have to be careful not to expect conferences like this  to produce miracles," Annan said.<p>"Obviously people came to Johannesburg expecting us to  solve all the problems here. This is just a beginning, but it's  an important beginning," he told a news conference.<p>Yet all delegates know that many of the promises made at a  first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, staged amid great  optimism after the end of the Cold War, have been broken.<p>The European Union gave a cool welcome to the summit's  blueprint and said it might be the last in a line of giant  summits trying to resolve planet-wide issues.<p>"We cannot be happy with everything" agreed in  Johannesburg, said Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen,  whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.<p>Among disappointments, he singled out a deal merely urging  a "substantial" increase in the use of renewable energies like  wind and solar power. Under pressure from Washington and OPEC  the goal was stripped of any clear targets.<p>Rasmussen said the EU would push ahead and set targets of  its own.  "I don't think that mega-summits are the way to secure  effective implementation," he told a news conference. He added  that the world should not start planning a follow-up summit in  five or 10 years' time.<p>Overnight, diplomats resolved their dispute over a clause  linking human rights to healthcare to hammer out a 65-page  action plan that leaders are due to adopt later Wednesday.<p>But the text's formal approval by delegation chiefs was  unlikely to be a simple rubber-stamping at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT).

<p>Many delegations said their heads of state or ministers would like to make 

formal statements, which may include serious reservations about parts of the final 

declaration.
