JERUSALEM -- Twenty years ago, Israel set out to rearrange the geopolitical balance 

in the region by invading Lebanon. The result--for Israel, the Palestinians, the 

United States and the peace process--was a catastrophe whose lessons should not 

be forgotten by either the warriors or the peacemakers in the current West Bank 

conflict.

<p>The circumstances of the two military adventures are eerily similar. So is 

the cast of characters, as well as the high stakes involved for Washington. Israel's 

reasons for taking the offensive in Lebanon and the West Bank were the same: to 

root out terrorism. The world's angry reaction was the same. So much is unchanged 

that one Israeli newspaper has called the current crisis "Sharon versus Arafat, 

Round II."

<p>Today, as he was in Lebanon, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is trapped by 

the forces of Ariel Sharon, now Israel's prime minister. Refugee camps look as 

though they have been struck by an earthquake. The United States is once again 

oddly uninfluential with Israel and less than accommodating to Palestinians. As 

one Israeli columnist put it, rephrasing Marx, people should remember that history 

occurs twice--first as tragedy, then as super-tragedy. In April 1982, Arafat was 

ensconced in his Beirut fiefdom, running a state within a state from which he 

could attack the Golan and Galilee regions. Sharon, then the defense minister, 

wanted Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization out of Lebanon and asked U.S. 

Secretary of State Alexander Haig for a green light to invade. Haig didn't say 

yes; more important, he didn't say no.

<p>"This is the 20th century. You can't just invade a country like that," Philip 

C. Habib, President Reagan's envoy to the region, told Sharon. But Habib, like 

Anthony C. Zinni, who has a similar role under President Bush, had no luck reining 

in Sharon.

<p>Two months later, on June 6, Israel rolled across the border in tanks. Sharon's 

planners had figured that they could clean up Lebanon in a week with no more than 

100 casualties. Operation Peace for Galilee was to be limited, creating a 25-mile-deep 

buffer zone in southern Lebanon and, on Prime Minister Menachem Begin's orders, 

stopping far short of Beirut. Five weeks later, his top general rode into the 

Beirut neighborhood of Baabda in an armored personnel carrier, hot on Arafat's 

trail.

<p>"Sharon lied his way to Beirut," Nicholas A. Veliotes, assistant secretary 

of State and ambassador to Egypt in the Reagan administration, recalled recently. 

"His ostensible reason for the invasion approved by the Cabinet was to create 

a cordon sanitaire in the south; in reality, he had decided to seek to solve the 

Palestinian problem by military force."

<p>In Lebanon, as in the West Bank today, Israeli forces shredded Palestinian 

archives, payrolls, even students' academic records. Infrastructure was demolished, 

computers smashed. Terrorists and innocents alike were killed. Homes were blown 

up and bulldozed, refugee camps besieged. To critics, it appeared that Sharon 

was as intent on crippling the Palestinian spirit as he was on eradicating terrorism.

<p>"I don't think the Bush administration really understands who it is dealing 

with today," said Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist associated with the 

Council on Foreign Relations and the Center for Strategic and International Studies 

in Washington.

<p>"Sharon is a tactical tank commander, and he responds as one," Kipper said. 

"No one would have condemned him for going into the West Bank with commandos to 

go after individuals and groups responsible for terrorism. But a massive invasion 

of this nature is, in the long run, going to work against Israel's interests. 

And those of the United States. The repercussions are likely to be considerable."

<p>In Lebanon, they certainly were. The invasion gave birth to the Hezbollah terrorist 

organization. It brought Iranians into the Bekaa Valley, which in turn led to 

the kidnapping of Americans. And it unleashed the phenomenon of suicide bombings, 

first at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, then at a U.S. Marine barracks, where 241 

Americans died.

<p>Israeli officials dismiss parallels between Lebanon and the West Bank, pointing 

out that today ruthless terrorists are operating inside Israel, not in some other 

country. Indeed, although many Israelis, including members of the opposition Labor 

Party, opposed the Lebanon incursion, 75% of Israelis support Sharon's ironfisted 

actions in the West Bank, according to one poll.

<p>Israel's siege of Beirut lasted 70 days and its occupation of southern Lebanon 

18 years. The war claimed thousands of lives--half of them civilian, Lebanon says--and 

destroyed Israel's image, perhaps forever, as an underdog battling aggressive 

Arabs. It resulted in the evacuation of Arafat and his guerrillas to scattered 

Arab nations. It led Arabs to view the U.S. as a co-aggressor, particularly because 

the operation had largely been completed by the time Reagan called Prime Minister 

Begin to complain of "needless destruction and bloodshed."

<p>"I'll tell you what this war taught us," Arafat told an American journalist 

the day he boarded a ship for exile to Tunisia. "It taught us that the real enemy 

is the United States. It is against you that we must fight. Not because your bombs 

killed our people but because you have closed your eyes to what is moral and just."

<p>Some of Reagan's senior advisors favored talking tough to the Arabs and declaring 

Israel a "strategic asset" in the struggle against the Soviet Union, a policy 

that would have obscured the Palestinian issue in the larger context of Middle 

East peace. They included Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, Richard Pearl, Peter 

Rodman and James Roche.

<p>For his part, Bush was hesitant to step into the Israeli-Palestinian quagmire. 

When he did, critics say, it was primarily because Palestinian suicide bombings 

fit into the context of the war on terrorism and because he needed the support 

of moderate Arab leaders--who were critical of his inaction--in order to carry 

the war to Iraq. Among Bush's top advisors today are Wolfowitz, Feith, Pearl, 

Rodman and Roche.

<p>Ironically, while Arafat jetted around the world like a head of state after 

being forced out of Lebanon, Sharon's career was derailed by Beirut, where, in 

the final days of the siege, a Christian militia aligned with Israel massacred 

at least 700 Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. A court 

of inquiry said Sharon bore indirect responsibility, and he was forced to resign. 

Many Israelis disdained him as a disgraced commander and the architect of the 

Lebanon debacle.

<p>Just as ironically, it was Arafat who almost single-handedly rescued Sharon 

from political oblivion. By walking away from a far-reaching Israeli peace offer 

in 2000, then overseeing an escalation in terror against Israel, Arafat made even 

moderate Israelis yearn for an uncompromising leader who would stop at nothing 

to secure their borders. The man they chose as their new prime minister was Sharon, 

who had once suggested "transferring" all Palestinians to Jordan.

<p> Sharon has defeated Arafat in the West Bank, as surely as he did in Lebanon. 

But few Israelis believe that will end terrorism, and many are thinking back to 

Lebanon, asking: "What's next? How do we prevent history from repeating itself?"
