<p>MADISON, Wis -- The U.S. Conference of Mayors has drawn more than 200 leaders 

from around the country this week to discuss issues from affordable housing to 

the environment. 

<P> But the conference is also being attended by corporations that

are coming under fire for providing financial contributions that

critics say give them access ordinary citizens couldn't afford.

</font>"The catch is that these mayors are representatives of the people, not 

representatives of the corporations," said Nick Kropotkin, 25, a member of <a href="http://www.resist-the-mayors.org/" target="_new">Creative 

People's Resistance</a>. 

<P> "We believe the public should be able to have either a, equal

input, or b, total input," he said. "The public will be

completely roped off."

<P> On Sunday, some of the frustration spilled out to the streets of

Madison.

<P> About 200 protesters, some in masks, gathered outside a

reception at the University of Wisconsin's Memorial Union Terrace,

where corporate interests paid thousands of dollars to hang out

with the mayors, partying to the sounds of a blues band while

drinking beer and eating bratwurst.

<P> During the march, protesters carried signs that read

"Corporations are not people" and "Cities for people! Not

profits!"

<P> Some protesters tried to knock down and break through a snow

fence closing off the area, and some threw objects at police

officers in riot gear, resulting in six arrests, police said.

<P> Madison Mayor Sue Bauman said close to $900,000 in corporate

contributions are what made it possible for the city -- one of the

smallest to host the conference -- to cover the cost of various

social and evening events, transportation, youth events and tours

for spouses.

<P> "The conference of mayors is made up of mayors; the dues come

from taxpayer moneys," she said. "I'm not about to use taxpayer

dollars for food and beverage and entertainment, and that's why

we've raised money."

<P> In addition to sponsoring social events, more than 70 individual

companies pay $10,000 each in annual dues to be members of the

conference's business council, which was established to help cities

work more closely with corporations.

<P> Philip Morris spokesman Dave Tovar said sponsoring the

conference and being on the council gives the company a chance to

meet one-on-one with the mayors.

<P> "Every year federal, state and local governments take action on

a number of issues that are of concern to a number of our employees

and shareholders," Tovar said. The company paid $75,000 for the

conference.

<P> Daimler-Chrysler spokesman James Kenyon said the automaker, a

$25,000 sponsor which hosted a Sunday picnic for the mayors at a

Madison park, is using the conference for marketing and lobbying.

<P> Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick drove into the convention center

Saturday in the automaker's Dodge Ram truck, billed as the "Mayor

of Truckville."

<P> But Kenyon said the company also wants to meet with the mayors

to gain some influence.

<P> "We are very interested in the rules and regulation and laws

that govern those cities and how they affect us," he said. "It's

very important that we interact."

<P> Jeff Griffin, mayor of Reno, Nev., said the corporate

sponsorships are entirely appropriate.

<P> When Reno hosted the conference four years ago, the city raised

$850,000 from private donors and ended up giving $150,000 to

charity, he said.

<P> "I don't think there's corporate influence by any means. I

think we do business with people who like to do business with

mayors and cities," he said.

<P> Kropotkin said the corporate involvement shows the mayors'

conference has moved too far away from its original mission.

<P> "It has entirely lost its focus and its meaning as being a resource for citizens 

to improve daily life," he said.
