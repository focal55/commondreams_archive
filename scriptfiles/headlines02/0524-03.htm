<p>The International Whaling Commission's (IWC) week-long annual plenary closed with a ban on commercial hunting in place for another year, but divisive debate over aboriginal whaling leaving member nations oceans apart.</p>

<p>The issue that attracted the most attention ahead of the meeting -- whether Japan would succeed in overturning a 16-year-old ban moratorium on commercial whaling -- never looked remotely likely in the debating chamber.</p>

</font>Japan's perennial proposal to lift the commercial ban in place since the 1985-86 season was easily defeated by 16-25 on Thursday, far short of the three-quarters majority needed to pass it.

<p>But the commission was left acrimoniously paralyzed as a Tokyo-led minority twice rejected a proposal to renew the five-year 280-bowhead whale catch for northern natives, mainly in Alaska, which expires this year.</p>

<p>"In the 56 years of history in the IWC, that was the most unjust, unkind, unfair vote that was ever taken," US commissioner Rolland Schmitten told reporters after losing a second vote on the issue by a narrow 32-11, one short of the three-quarters majority needed.</p>

<p>"We have had Eskimos calling, asking their leaders will they get their food," he said. "That vote definitely clinched it. The views of Japan and others was no, they will not."</p>

<p>Japan used its minority bloc to reject the proposal after its own request for 50 minke whale for hard-hit Japanese coastal communities was denied.</p>

<p>Conservation groups said they were enraged by the proposed trade-offs on community whaling that some said held aboriginals "hostage" at the expense of unjustified requests from Japan.</p>

<p>"It's absolutely disgusting," said Greenpeace spokesman Simon Reddy. "They used the Inuit and Chukotka tribes as a pawn in this political game."</p>

<p>Japanese senior delegate Masayuki Komatsu said the defeat of Japan's longstanding request for the 50 minke whales showed the IWC had a "double standard".</p>

<p>However, the support for Japan's stance on the resumption of commercial whaling had been promising, he said.</p>

<p>"In the 15 years of our request, we have never been able to press our case as strongly as we did this year," he said.</p>

<p>The pro-whaling bloc led by Japan and Norway included many Caribbean states including Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada and St. Lucia, as well as Benin, Gabon, Mongolia and Palau.</p>

<p>The anti-whalers included Australia, Brazil, Britain, India, New Zealand, Finland, Sweden, most of mainland Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>During the heated week of debate, delegation members accused each other of lying, of breaking backroom deals and destroying the credibility of the commission.</p>

<p>"Considering the way this meeting has gone over the last few days, I wonder what honor is left in this organization," UK commissioner Richard Cowan told the plenary.</p>
