KUWAIT  - U.S. Assistant Secretary of State

William Burns said on Saturday the United States has yet to

decide on whether to use military force against Iraq and that

Washington plans to discuss the issue with its Gulf War   allies.

<p>``The (U.S.) President and Secretary (of State Colin) Powell

made clear there has not been any decision made with regard to

particular options but they have also made clear that all

options are available,'' Burns told a news conference in Kuwait

at the start of a tour of the region.<p>``But we will consult really closely with our friends in

Kuwait and other countries of the region on this subject,'' he

added.<p>Burns met Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad

al-Sabah and other senior Kuwaiti officials before heading to

Bahrain, his next stop. He is also expected to visit Qatar,

United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

<p>The United States launched military strikes on Afghanistan 

in October to flush out Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden,

accused by Washington of masterminding the September 11

attacks.

<p>Speculation has intensified that the United States is about

to start a new phase of its ``war on terrorism,'' possibly

attacking countries such as Somalia, Iraq or Sudan.

<p>President Bush  recently warned that Iraqi President Saddam

Hussein  would ``find out'' the consequences if he did not

re-admit United Nations weapons inspectors, triggering

speculation that Iraq might be the United States' next target.

<p>``At the moment, our focus with regard to military questions

is on the campaign in Afghanistan and the al Qaeda network and

that is something we are determined to finish,'' Burns said.<p>Iraq is on a U.S. list of states sponsoring terrorism, but

Baghdad denies any links to international terrorism.<p>``We have, like Kuwait, some serious concerns about the

behavior of the (Iraqi) regime...its failure to abide by its

U.N. Security Council obligations with regard to weapons of

mass destruction, inspectors and missing Kuwaitis,'' Burns said.<p>The Arab League, of which Kuwait is a member, has declared

its opposition to any attack on Iraq.<p>The U.N. inspectors left Iraq in December 1998, shortly

before a U.S.-British bombing campaign, and have not been

allowed to return since.<p>Iraq, under international sanctions over its 1990 invasion

of Kuwait, says it has no weapons of mass destruction and wants

a complete end to the U.N. embargo.<p>Some 8,000 U.S. ground troops are now stationed in Kuwait,

involved in desert exercises.
