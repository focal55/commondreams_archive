<p>UNITED NATIONS - Iraq agreed on Monday to allow the unconditional return of 

U.N. arms inspectors amid an intense lobbying campaign by Washington which was 

backed up by the threat of U.S.-led military action.

</table></font>"I can confirm to you that I have received a letter from  the Iraqi authorities conveying their decision to allow the  return of the inspectors without conditions," U.N.  Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters after receiving a  letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri.<p>"We reached satisfactory results and there is good news,"  Sabri told reporters after handing the letter over. "The  secretary-general ... will announce the good news to you."<p>U.N. weapons inspectors, responsible for checking Iraq for  nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic weapons, were  pulled out of Iraq in December 1998 on the eve of U.S.-British  bombing raids and had not been permitted to return.<p>The details of the letter were not immediately available  and it was not clear whether the contents would be acceptable  to the United States.<p>Arab and European leaders had detected signs of Iraqi  flexibility on inspections after Saudi Arabia made clear at the  weekend that it would back U.N.-sanctioned action to force  Baghdad to disarm.<p>A Bush administration official said earlier on Monday that  Iraq was considering writing to Annan "making some sort of a  concession toward readmitting weapons inspectors."<p>U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric de la Riviere said Sabri  handed over the letter at a meeting also attended by Arab  League Secretary-General Amr Moussa.<p>Annan will pass the letter to Bulgaria, the current  chairman of the U.N. Security Council, he added.<p>The U.S. campaign for maximum pressure on Iraq gathered  strength over the weekend when Saudi Arabia said it would back  action against Iraq if the United Nations approved it.<p>In another sign of mounting pressure on Saddam, Defense  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that U.S. and British warplanes  enforcing no-fly zones in north and south Iraq were taking a  more active approach, methodically attacking air defenses.<p>Iraq had moved missiles and other military equipment close  to civilian sites in recent days, mirroring similar movements  in the past that signaled Baghdad was feeling under threat, a  U.S. official said.<p>In Iraq, Saddam met his top aides twice on Monday to  discuss "the current political situation," the official Iraqi  News Agency reported.<p>The United States and the United Nations insist on an  unconditional Iraqi agreement to unrestricted access for the  inspectors.<p>The United States also has a policy of "regime change" in  Iraq and has refused to say that compliance with U.N.  resolutions would be enough to avert an attack.<p>POLITICAL DYNAMIC CHANGES<p>Speculation about readmission of the arms inspectors had  been rife.<p>French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said: "During  the last days and mainly the last hours, there have been lots  of rumors concerning the fact the Iraqis may accept the return  of inspectors."<p>Earlier Secretary of State Colin Powell had said: "The  political dynamic has changed and there's a great deal of  pressure now being placed on Iraq to come into compliance with  the U.N. mandates of the last 12 years."<p>Powell, following up on a tough U.N. speech by President  Bush last week, said he and other members of the 15-nation  Security Council were working on a new resolution on Iraq to be  completed "in the not too distant future."<p>The United States is lobbying for a strong U.N. resolution  demanding that Iraq disarm, preferably with a threat of severe  consequences if Baghdad does not comply.<p>France wants a two-stage process -- with the first  resolution demanding a return of arms inspectors and a second  dealing with the potential consequences of refusal.<p>A U.S. official said the United States expected elements of  a resolution to be drafted by Wednesday and wanted the measure  circulated among Security Council members by Friday.<p>"People are putting pen to paper," one diplomat said,  adding that talks among all 15 members would begin next week.<p>MILITARY ACTION<p>Rumsfeld said he did not know how quickly Baghdad could  repair command and control buildings and military airfields now  being attacked in the event that Bush ordered an invasion.<p>The number of air strikes has increased in recent weeks,  although military officials have insisted they were in response  to Iraqi attempts to shoot down planes and not linked with any  possible wider military initiative.<p>Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal indicated in a  weekend interview that Saudi Arabia, the main launchpad in the  1991 Gulf War, would again allow the use of bases on its soil  to attack Iraq should such action win full U.N. backing.<p>Saudi Arabia, Washington's main ally in the oil-rich Gulf  region, had previously agreed with other Arab allies to oppose  a military attack on Iraq.<p>Prince Saud, asked by CNN if Riyadh would allow the use of  its bases for a campaign against Iraq, said: "If the United  Nations takes a decision by the Security Council to implement a  policy of the U.N., every country that has signed the charter  of the U.N. has to fulfill it."<p>A senior Saudi official on Monday reiterated his country's  opposition to any unilateral U.S. attack, which had been  indicated by a bellicose tone this summer from Washington,<p>"Saudi Arabia rejects any unilateral attack that has no  international cover," said the official, contacted by Reuters  in Riyadh from Dubai.<p>"The shift is in the American position, not the Saudi  position," he added, referring to U.S. attempts to lobby the  U.N. Security Council against Iraq rather than act alone.<p>The reaction of the Saudi government and its Arab neighbors  to the news that Iraq would readmit inspectors was not  immediately clear.

<p>Some 5,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed at the kingdom's Prince Sultan 

Air Base, which was the command center for the U.S.-led alliance that evicted 

Iraq from Kuwait in 1991, although many U.S. military command facilities have 

since been moved to Qatar.
