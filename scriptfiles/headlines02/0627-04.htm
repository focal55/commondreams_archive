<p>WASHINGTON - As Enron Corp. collapsed under the weight of financial misdeeds 

last year, White House officials carefully distanced themselves, fearing the public 

would associate President Bush with the embattled energy executives who had donated 

so much money to his campaign. 

<P> But Enron, as it turned out, was not the only lurking political liability. 

After escaping its demise relatively unscathed, Bush is now struggling to manage 

the fallout from a much wider pattern of corporate mismanagement - one that is 

roiling the stock market, threatening to undermine the economy, and providing 

a potentially powerful issue for Democrats in midterm election campaigns. 

<P> From Arthur Andersen to Martha Stewart, and from Tyco to WorldCom, the Bush 

administration is contending with a series of corporate improprities of the type 

that, rightly or wrongly, the public has historically associated with pro-business 

Republicans. 

<P> The issue of corporate abuse is so politically charged that Bush himself raised 

the topic in Canada yesterday, calling it ''outrageous'' that WorldCom improperly 

accounted for $3.9 billion in expenses, covering up a net loss for 2001 and first-quarter 

2002. 

<P> ''I am deeply concerned about some of the accounting practices that take place 

in America,'' Bush said at the Group of Eight summit in Canada. ''We've had too 

many cases of people abusing their responsibilities ... We will pursue within 

our laws those who are irresponsible.'' 

<P> While Enron cost thousands of employees their retirement savings, the combined 

effect of the scandals since has been a spreading loss of confidence in the stock 

market - a potentially devastating development for retirees nationwide and a damper 

on hiring and employment. 

<P> Both parties have pounced on accounting standards, retirement plan regulations, 

and the closing of corporate tax loopholes as areas where Congress should act, 

and each has tried to tarnish the other for its ties to corporate failures. After 

Bush's ties to Enron were exposed, Republicans enthusiastically advertised that 

Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, had made millions 

investing in Global Crossing, a telecommunications concern, before it went bankrupt. 

<P> Both parties received sizable contributions from executives who later ran 

afoul of accounting standards. 

<P> WorldCom donated $1 million to the University of Mississippi's Trent Lott 

Leadership Institute in 1999, and its donations to Republican Representative Chip 

Pickering, also of Mississippi, are threatening to become an issue in his reelection 

campaign this year. Lott, the Senate minority leader, even cites WorldCom on the 

''popular tourist sites'' page of his Senate Web site. 

<P> In the 2002 election cycle, WorldCom gave 53 percent of its campaign contributions 

to Democrats, compared with 47 percent to Republicans, according to the Center 

for Responsive Politics. In the 2000 election cycle, 65 percent of WorldCom's 

donations went to Republicans, with 35 percent going to Democrats. 

<P> But Democrats, desperate for a nonterrorism-related subject to combat the 

Republicans with this fall, have seized on fresh polling data that suggest they 

may have found a viable topic. According to a letter released yesterday by Democratic 

strategists Bob Shrum, James Carville, and Stan Greenberg, the issue for Republicans 

this year is ''not just `the economy, stupid,''' as it was in 1992. ''It is corporate 

irresponsibility on a stunning scale, and a Republican approach that tolerates 

or even rewards it,'' the letter reads. 

<P> Carl Forti, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, 

scoffed at what he described as the ever-changing Democratic ''issue'' - first 

energy, then prescription drugs, then corporate accountability. 

<P> ''The bottom line is that it isn't a political issue. Just like Enron was, 

it's a business issue. You have the president and Congress investigating and cracking 

down; it's pretty hard to accuse Republicans of doing nothing,'' Forti said. 

<P> None of the proposals in the legislative pipeline have become law. And in 

the current political climate - with the elections less than five months away, 

and a Department of Homeland Security still to be approved - it will be a struggle 

for Congress to achieve significant reforms this year, although the recent scandals 

certainly will give the proposals new impetus. 

<P> One bill - it passed the House over Democratic objections that it's too lenient 

- would tighten accounting rules by setting up a new panel to oversee the accounting 

industry, though continuing to leave much discretion to the Securities and Exchange 

Commission. 

<P> Another House bill, based on a White House plan, would change retirement rules 

to ensure that employees would have to hold company-donated stock in their 401(k) 

plans for only three years before selling - a point prompted by Enron, which required 

some workers to hold the stock until age 50. Companies would also have to give 

workers more up-to-date information about their accounts. 

<P> In the Senate, the Banking Committee has passed a far stricter accounting 

bill that would set up a board to police the industry and ban accounting firms 

from providing specific consulting services to clients. The Senate version would 

also limit the amount of time a senior account exective could work for a particular 

client, a move that Banking Committee Republicans voted to approve. 

<P> Also in the Senate, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat from Massachusetts, 

is shepherding a retirement savings bill that would put a de facto cap on the 

amount of corporate stock employees could hold in 401(k) accounts. But he has 

not had enough support among fellow Democrats - who think it goes too far - to 

bring the bill to the Senate floor. In a similar vein, a Senate committee has 

moved to bar companies from reincorporating in Bermuda to avoid US taxes. 

<P> Even before this week's WorldCom revelations, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, 

a South Dakota Democrat, had been planning to combine an accounting bill and a 

retirement savings bill for a joint vote in July. Daschle now plans to vote on 

the accounting changes as soon as Congress returns from its weeklong July 4 recess 

- yet another sign of Democrats' enthusiasm for raising the profile of corporate 

mismanagement in a campaign year. 

<P> ''We are dismayed and we are angered with the news of WorldCom,'' Daschle 

told reporters yesterday. ''This is reprehensible.'' 

<P> Daschle also attacked SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, a former lawyer for the accounting 

industry and a Bush appointee. ''He's not doing the job,'' Daschle said. 

<P> Republicans were equally harsh in their condemnation of WorldCom, and in their 

insistence that the federal government take action to curb corporate mismanagement. 

<P> The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana 

Republican - he is spearheading hearings on Enron, Arthur Andersen, and Global 

Crossing - compared the WorldCom case to ''the accounting hocus-pocus that occurred 

at Enron.'' 

<P> ''Until somebody goes to jail, I'm not sure these people are going to get 

the message,'' Senator John S. McCain, Republican from Arizona, told a Senate 

hearing. 

<P> Bush, speaking to reporters with British Prime Minister Tony Blair by his 

side, tried to sound at once tough and optimistic. 

<P> ''There is a need for a renewed corporate responsibility in America,'' Bush 

said, building on a theme that he first began to discuss earlier this year. ''Those 

entrusted with shareholders' money must - must - strive for the highest of high 

standards.'' 

<P> Then, he added, ''The good news is most corporate leaders in America are good, 

honest, open people who care deeply about shareholders and employees. And our 

economy is strong. When we find egregious practices, such as the one revealed 

today, we'll go after them. And need to.''
