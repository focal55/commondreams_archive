</table>&quot;We have arrested about 100 people for trespassing and

creating disturbances inside the factory without permission,&quot; a

police officer in Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh state,

said. He said the protesters were expected to be freed on

Monday night.<P> During the demonstration, several hundred people broke open

the gates of the Union Carbide plant where a poisonous gas leak

in December 1984 killed 3,000 people outright and put up

banners calling for the plant's clean-up, witnesses and police

said.<P> Environmental groups say tonnes of toxic waste still lie

within the walls of the pesticide plant 18 years after what was

one of the world's worst industrial accidents.<P> They say the waste has contaminated the air and water and

is causing severe health problems for nearby residents.<P> &quot;We have been forced to take direct action because nobody

has done anything,&quot; Sati Nath Sarangi, a spokesman for the

Bhopal Group of Information and Action (BGIA), told Reuters.<P> Those arrested included activists belonging to the

environmental group, Greenpeace, and victims of the gas

disaster as well as some foreigners, the police official said.<P> He did not disclose the nationalities of the foreigners.<P> Aside from the 3,000 people killed at the time, thousands

more died in the years afterward and tens of thousands were

left with lifelong illnesses.<P> Although the Indian government's civil case against Union

Carbide, which merged with U.S.-based Dow Chemical Co two years

ago, was settled in 1989 for $470 million, criminal cases

continue in Indian courts.<P> Earlier this year, a Bhopal court rejected a plea by Indian

police to reduce charges against Warren Anderson, former

chairman of Union Carbide, from culpable homicide to a &quot;rash

and negligent act&quot;. He faces a jail term of up to 10 years if

found guilty.<p align="center">&copy; 2002 Reuters Ltd</p>
