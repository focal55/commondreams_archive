Amnesty International published a report hitting out at violations of the rights of prisoners being held by the US army in Cuba and Afghanistan.

<p>"The USA's 'pick and choose' approach to the Geneva Convention is unacceptable, as is its failure to respect fundamental international human rights standards," the organization said Monday in the 62-page document, which was sent to the US government earlier.</p>

<p>Amnesty repeated its request to Washington to be allowed to visit the prisoners held in Afghanistan and at the US Guantanamo base in Cuba where some 300 alleged members of the terrorist group al-Qaeda or the Afghan Taliban were sent.</p>

<p>A previous request sent to the US government in January came to nothing, the London-based human rights organization said.</p>

<p>In its report, Amnesty again accused the United States of failing to grant the detainees rights that are universally recognized for any suspect placed in provisional detention.</p>

<p>It denounced the American authorities' failure to give the detainees prisoner of war status, to grant them access to a lawyer or to bring them before a competent tribunal as laid down in the Geneva Conventions.</p>

<p>"The US government must ensure that all its actions in relation to those in its custody in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay comply with international law and standards," Amnesty International wrote.</p>

<p>"This is crucial if justice is to be done and seen to be done, and if respect for the rule of law and human rights is not to be undermined."</p>
