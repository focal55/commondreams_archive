<p>A campaign to discredit the UN weapons inspections mission to Iraq flared into 

action yesterday with the publication of bizarre personal details about one of 

the experts waiting to go to Baghdad. 

<P>About 100 weapons experts have been selected so far to join the mission's chief, 

Hans Blix, in Iraq. The team is expected to grow to 300 experts over the coming 

weeks. 

<P>However, a report in the Washington Post yesterday suggested that the relatively 

small world of weapons experts was fraught with rivalries. 

<P>A number of former inspectors - who apparently were not selected by Mr Blix 

- say the new teams lack experience, and accuse him of deliberately overlooking 

old hands for fear of antagonizing Iraq. 

<P>The newspaper went on to detail the sexual practices of one of the current 

inspectors. 

<P>Harvey "Jack" McGeorge, 53, from Virginia, is a co-founder of an S &amp; M 

group in the Washington DC area, and a former chairman of the board for the National 

Coalition for Sexual Freedom. 

<P>The former marine was recommended for the mission by the US state department, 

and is now in New York. 

<P>He heads his own security consultancy, selling counter-bioterrorism products 

and conducting seminars on chemical and biological weapons, but he does not hold 

a scientific degree. 

<P>A trawl of the internet by the Post found that Mr McGeorge was also a member 

of the Leather Leadership Conference Inc, which "produces training sessions for 

current and potential leaders of the sadomasochism/leather/fetish community". 

<P>In an interview with the newspaper, Mr McGeorge said he would resign rather 

than damage the UN mission. 

<P>"I have been very upfront with people in the past about what I do, and it has 

never prevented me from getting a job or doing service," he said. "I am who I 

am. I am not ashamed of who I am - not one bit. But I cannot allow my actions, 

as they may be perceived by others, to damage an organization which has done nothing 

to deserve that damage." 

<P>A spokesman for the UN said that Mr McGeorge's private life had nothing to 

do with his qualifications as an inspector. 

<P>However, he provides a convenient target for critics of Mr Blix, particularly 

aggrieved former inspectors. 

<P>They say he has overlooked potentially qualified experts by requiring applicants 

to quit their government jobs before applying. There are also fears that some 

members of the teams are from private industry, and will use the mission to garner 

media attention and sell their products.</p>
