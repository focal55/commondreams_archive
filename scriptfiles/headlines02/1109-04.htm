photographs of shackled and hooded terror prisoners from Afghanistan, apparently 

taken as a souvenir by a U.S. soldier, were mysteriously made public yesterday 

and brought renewed allegations of human-rights violations against the United 

States for treatment of captives in its war on terror.

<P>The photographs show the prisoners, possibly Taliban or al-Qaeda fighters, 

shackled, arms bound, wearing black cloth hoods and seated inside a C-130 cargo 

plane decorated with a large American flag. <a href="http://artbell.com/letters88.html" target="_new">The 

pictures</a> were sent by anonymous e-mail to the Web site of U.S. radio talk-show 

host Art Bell.</P>

<P>The Pentagon said the pictures had not been authorized and it was investigating 

how they became public. The photos are the first to show the methods used for 

transferring prisoners around Afghanistan and to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo 

Bay, Cuba.</P>

<P>They earned immediate condemnation from human-rights organizations while military 

experts said the measures taken by the U.S. soldiers appeared excessive.</P>

<P>Prisoners must of course be searched and disarmed, said Michel Drapeau, a retired 

colonel in the Canadian army. &#34;While in closed custody you want to make sure 

that the enemy is restrained to the degree required to ensure both his safety 

and the safety of his captors, and to prevent his escape or his capacity to inflict 

harm or injury on anyone,&#34; he said.</P>

<P>But the photos show steps taken to intimidate and humiliate the prisoners, 

he said, and the contrast between the heavily armed soldiers and their cowed and 

scruffy charges looks like overkill. &#34;Even people very, very sympathetic to 

the U.S. such as myself would say, &#39;Come on. Where could they possibly go?' 

&#34;</P>

<P>Neither the United States nor Canada would want to see its citizens treated 

in this manner by a foreign government, he said, even if detained on criminal 

charges. The U.S. Defense Department has prohibited news media from photographing 

any part of the prisoner transfer operation and severely limited media access 

to the detention center in Guantanamo Bay.</P>

<P>&#34;We have very, very tight restrictions on any images of the detainees for 

security purposes and because we have no interest in potentially holding detainees 

up for any kind of public ridicule,&#34; Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke 

told a press conference yesterday.</P>

<P>But that explanation did not carry much weight with human-rights groups.</P>

<P>&#34;We have all along raised concerns that when individuals are being detained 

and transferred, in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo, that they be treated in accordance 

with international standards, which among other things prohibit torture and ill-treatment,&#34; 

said Alex Neve of Amnesty International Canada. Sensory deprivation, including 

extended periods under a hood, is considered ill treatment and possibly even as 

a form of torture, he said.</P>

<P>Meanwhile yesterday, U.S. officials said that one of five men killed in a CIA 

hit on al-Qaeda suspects in Yemen Sunday was a U.S. citizen named Ahmed Hijazi 

linked to members of the alleged al-Qaeda cell in suburban Buffalo. Authorities 

had said two members of the cell remained at large.</p> </P>
