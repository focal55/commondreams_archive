has angered the United States by telling other members of the United Nations Security 

Council that Washington’s policy of regime change had been suspended. 

<P>Diplomats said that Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain’s UN Ambassador, told the 

ten non-permanent members of Security Council at a private briefing on Friday 

that Washington had put regime change “on ice” unless the inspections process 

came to a grinding halt in the view of Hans Blix, the chief UN inspector. 

<P>However, a US official told <I>The Times</I> yesterday that Sir Jeremy’s assertion 

was absolutely false and insisted that regime change remained official American 

policy. 

<P>The row has exposed a fundamental difference between Britain and the United 

States just as they are trying to muster support for a new resolution spelling 

out the terms for the resumption of inspections. While Washington demands that 

President Saddam Hussein be forced from power, Britain has never publicly committed 

itself to regime change, which goes beyond existing UN demands. 

<P>Tony Blair sidestepped the question in an interview last week with the German 

newspaper <I>Tagesspiegel</I>. Asked if British policy included ousting Saddam, 

Mr Blair said: “The regime of Saddam Hussein is loathsome, but the demand from 

the international community is the entry of weapons inspectors at any time and 

in any place in Iraq.” 

<P>Britain had planned to introduce a draft resolution before the Security Council 

this week setting terms for inspections and warning of the consequences of non-co-operation. 

<P>But the drafting of a text has been delayed by protracted discussions between 

London and Washington, where hawks are pushing for tougher language. Diplomats 

say it is now possible that the United States will sponsor its own harshly worded 

resolution instead. 

<P>Alarmed by Iraqi statements in recent days, which seem to impose conditions 

on the inspectors’ access, hardliners in the Bush Administration — led by Dick 

Cheney, the Vice-President — are seeking clear commitments from Iraq before the 

first inspectors go to the country. 

<P>Particularly disturbing to the hardliners is the fact that the Iraqi Foreign 

Minister’s letter last Monday accepting the return of inspectors omitted any promise 

of “unfettered access” or Iraqi co-operation. 

<P>Later in the week Saddam’s own letter to the UN General Assembly seemed to 

impose veiled conditions by insisting that future inspections respect Iraq’s sovereignty 

and security. Then, over the weekend, Iraq made clear that it would not accept 

any change in the 1998 memorandum of understanding limiting access to eight presidential 

palaces. 

<P>Many other Security Council members are wary of the British-US effort to get 

a new resolution. At Friday’s closed-door meeting at the British mission several 

of the non-permanent members, including Cameroon, Guinea, Mauritius and Mexico, 

voiced concern that the proposed resolution was intended as a cover for US military 

action to oust Saddam. 

<P>In a direct challenge to the United States and Britain, France has drafted 

its own proposal, which omits most of the key provisions that its transatlantic 

allies want. 

<P>The French text, which has not been officially circulated, would require the 

United States and Britain to return to the Security Council for a second resolution 

to get authorization for military action in the event of Iraqi non-cooperation. 

It would also avoid declaring Iraq to be in “material breach” of its UN obligations 

— language that Britain and the United States interpret as an implicit authorization 

for the use of force.</p> </P>
