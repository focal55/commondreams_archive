<p> TEL AVIV - Israel's new security fence around the West Bank could prove to 

be the final straw for the already crippled Palestinian economy while having a 

minimal effect on Israel, analysts said.

</table></font>The fence, aimed at preventing suicide bombers and car  bombers from entering Israel, will also stop thousands of  Palestinians from working in Israel and earning badly needed  cash, representatives of donor countries and the United Nations  said.<p>Shaun Ferguson, head of the economic unit at UNSCO (United  Nations Special Coordinating Organization) in Ramallah said the  fence would lead to a sharp rise in unemployment in the West  Bank which some sources estimate at more than 60 percent.<p>"There's a strong correlation between Israeli closures and  rising poverty levels in the Palestinian areas," he said.  "There were 39,000 Palestinians working in Israel in the fourth  quarter of 2001. If you multiply that by a dependency ratio of  six you see the impact the fence will have."<p>Israel started work three weeks ago on the first stretch of  a 225-mile security fence which includes trenches, early  warning and surveillance devices in the northwest of the West  Bank. At a cost of $1 million per km, the 110-km first stage is  due to be completed within 10 months with plans to fence off  the entire West Bank.<p>Israel denied the fence would shut out legal workers.  "Our main focus is ending the unacceptable ease with which  Palestinian bombers have entered Israel," said Ra'anan Gissin,  a spokesman for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. "There will be  controlled crossing points for legal workers to get into  Israel."<p>"The border is porous and we need to prevent infiltration  and have sufficient early warning if bombers do get in."<p>Israel also started work on Sunday on a 50 km fence around  Jerusalem's borders with the West Bank in response to  Palestinian suicide bombings that have killed at least 80  people in the city since a Palestinian uprising began in  September 2000.<p>"The Palestinian economy has been dependent on salaries  from its workers in Israel since wages are much higher than in  the Palestinian areas," said a source for the international  donors to the Palestinian Authority who declined to be named.<p>"The fence will have an immediate impact since the economy  is doing so badly anything they earn prevents a human crisis.<p>"But the internal closures Israel has imposed in the West  Bank (since the outbreak of the uprising) almost makes the  fence irrelevant anyway since Palestinians cannot move around  and get to jobs in Israel," the source added.<p>At the start of the uprising 20 months ago, 60,000  Palestinians were working in Israel, the donor source said.<p>"That number has dropped dramatically as closures have  increased, but it's impossible to give a precise figure. It's  certain there will be a strong impact."<p>PALESTINIANS REPLACED BY OVERSEAS WORKERS<p>Israel has been weaning itself from its dependence on  Palestinian workers over the past decade following the first  Intifada, or uprising, of 1987-1993.<p>Today an estimated 300,000 workers from Romania, Thailand,  the Philippines, Turkey, China and many other countries have  replaced the Palestinians in the agriculture, construction and  service industries.<p>"At the peak in 1991-1992, there were about 200,000 legal  Palestinian workers and at least the same number of illegal  workers," said Gil Bufman, chief economist at Bank Leumi. "That  number has fallen due to the attacks over the years and the  economic links have weakened.<p>"The Palestinian economy shows growing poverty and  unemployment and a further push will cause a further  deterioration that will put the population in a very difficult  situation."<p>Bufman said the fence would also make financial  transactions more difficult since the shekel is the most widely  used currency in the Palestinian areas. "With fewer shekels  circulating, economic activity is going to fall."<p>He also said Israel could suffer from lower sales to the  Palestinians, particularly in the food sector, if Palestinian  earning power dropped but said the effect was likely to be  marginal.<p>Not everyone agrees, however, the Israeli fence will have a  major impact on the Palestinian economy.<p>Professor Gerald Steinberg, director of a program on  conflict management at Bar Ilan University, said the number of  legal Palestinian workers was "between several hundreds to a  few thousands."<p>He said a figure of 25,000 cited by the Israeli media for  the number crossing illegally into Israel on a daily or weekly  basis was "an exaggeration."<p>"The Palestinian economy has suffered during the past two  years and will continue to suffer," Steinberg said. "The  economic impact of the fence is marginal since the number of  workers has fallen dramatically in the past 10 years."

<p>He said 100,000 Palestinian workers living in Israel had entered illegally 

in the past five years and their importance to the Palestinian economy, from remittances, 

was much stronger than a few thousand entering and leaving on a daily or weekly 

basis.
