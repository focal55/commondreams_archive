<p>War against Iraq could escalate into a nuclear conflict and risk the lives 

of hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East, Dr Rowan Williams, the 

next Archbishop of Canterbury, warns today.</p>

<p>In his strongest criticism yet of military action, Dr Williams says that a 

pre-emptive strike against Saddam Hussein could "rapidly and uncontrollably spiral 

down into chaos." </p>

<p>In an article in The Telegraph, he adds that to ignore the fears of people 

in the area would leave the West open to the criticism that it was behaving like 

a colonial power.</p>

<p>His comments are unlikely to endear him to Downing Street, which is engaged 

in delicate negotiations over the wording of a new resolution on Iraq expected 

to be debated at the United Nations this week. </p>

<p>Government officials have already privately voiced their irritation at the 

anti-war rhetoric of Church of England bishops and Dr Williams, who was selected 

for the post of Archbishop by Tony Blair.</p>

<p>Making his first public statement since the retirement last Thursday of his 

predecessor, Dr George Carey, Dr Williams recognizes that the Iraqi regime is 

"brutal and violent". However, pre-emptive action against Saddam could "undermine 

the society of states" and destabilize other parts of the world, a dangerous prospect 

when a number of countries have weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>"The exact calculation of what weaponry might be employed by a cornered Saddam 

Hussein is uncertain; and so is the retaliation that might then be provoked in 

the region from its sole nuclear power, Israel," he says.</p>

<p>An attack by the West is likely to "risk the lives of hundreds of thousands 

in a region that could rapidly and uncontrollably spiral down into chaos. We also 

jeopardize any authority we might have to appeal for restraint in other situations 

on the basis of international law."</p>

<p>The moral issue is whether the West is the best judge of the needs of the region, 

especially when that judgment appears to overrule local concerns.</p>

<p>The Archbishop has been a consistent opponent of war against Iraq since he 

signed a declaration in July which described it as "illegal and immoral". On the 

day of his appointment later that month he pledged to continue asking "awkward 

questions". Dr Carey has also been an outspoken critic of action against Iraq.</p>

<p>The United States is expected to present a revised version of its draft resolution 

on Iraq to the UN within days.</p>

<p>Mr Blair and President George W Bush have been pressing for a tough resolution 

which would allow the West to take military action the moment Saddam frustrated 

the work of weapons inspectors. </p>

<p>But they are believed to have softened their language after Russia and France 

argued that a second resolution would have to be framed and debated for war to 

have a UN mandate.</p>

<p>Saddam said yesterday that Iraq would take the new resolution "into consideration" 

if it was not merely a pretext for an American strike on Baghdad.</p>
