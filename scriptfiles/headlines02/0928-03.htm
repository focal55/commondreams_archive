            <p>In an effort to counter what they label as a McCarthyesque hunt 

              by a pro-Israel think tank, about 100 professors from across the 

              country have asked to be added to a "Campus Watch" Web site that 

              singled out eight professors because of their views on Palestine 

              and Islam. 

            <P>The Web site lists "dossiers" for the eight university professors 

              and teachers, including a graduate student instructor from UC Berkeley, 

              and portrays them as preaching dangerous rhetoric to students. The 

              site also calls them "hostile" to America. 

            <P>Run by the Middle East Forum, a Philadelphia think tank, the site, 

              www. campus-watch.org, also asks for people to snitch on Middle 

              East lectures, classes and demonstrations. 

            <P>"We are all ill-served by the mistakes, intolerance, the extremism, 

              the duplicity, that one finds in Middle Eastern studies," said Daniel 

              Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum. "Middle Eastern studies 

              is in an Enron- type crisis. . . . We are putting a spotlight on 

              what we consider to be a problem." 

            <P>But Judith Butler, a UC Berkeley professor of rhetoric and comparative 

              literature, said it is an intimidation tactic. 

            <P>The professors listed on the site have been spammed with tens of 

              thousands of racist, obscene and threatening e-mails. 

            <P>"If a group establishes a Web site and says, 'We are watching you,' 

              that has a very chilling impact on academic freedom," said Butler, 

              who was one of the first to ask to be added to the list. "The more 

              people who actively volunteer themselves for such a list, the less 

              that power of intimidation works." 

            <P>This is among recent tensions on university campuses regarding 

              the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 

            <P>Last week, Harvard University President Lawrence Summers expressed 

              his concern that a call by students for divestment of university 

              endowment funds from Israel is an example of anti-Semitic actions. 

            <P>But Butler, who is Jewish, said there is "a very fundamental mistake 

              in assuming that any position critical of contemporary Israeli policy 

              is anti- Semitic. One can be pro-Israel and be extremely critical 

              of (Prime Minister) Ariel Sharon and the occupation." 

            <P>Pipes said he started the site to monitor anti-Israel sentiment 

              because he saw Middle Eastern studies as a monotheistic field where 

              alternative viewpoints are not heard. 

            <P>"The ivory tower has this privileged notion that no one can complain," 

              Pipes said. 

            <P>The Campus Watch Web site had received about 20,000 hits since 

              it went up last week, he said. 

            <P>The professors who have asked to be included on the Web site may 

              be put on a new list under a label of people who associate themselves 

              with "suicide bombings and militants," Pipes said. 

            <P>Professor Hamid Dabashi, chairman of the department of Middle East 

              and Asian languages and cultures at Columbia University, said in 

              an e-mail Friday that he is "honored" that so many of his colleagues 

              across the country have chosen to speak out against the site by 

              offering their names for the list. 

            <P>"I have received more moral support and endorsement of my career 

              as a teacher and a scholar over the last couple of weeks than ever 

              before," he said. 

            <P>". . . I have a stake in being party to voices of civilized dissent 

              against this horrific environment of fear, violence and intimidation 

              that the likes of Daniel Pipes want to perpetuate so that only their 

              views are heard." 

            <P>The list includes Stanford University, UC Berkeley and San Francisco 

              State University among 15 institutions to watch. For UC Berkeley, 

              the site gives information about graduate student Snehal Shingavi, 

              whose dossier is listed with the targeted professors, because of 

              a controversy over a course on Palestinian poetry that he is teaching. 

              The site says one class at the University of Chicago is an "extended 

              rant against Israel" and that professors referred to modern Israel 

              as Palestine. 

            <P>Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Middle Eastern history and director 

              for the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago, 

              who is listed on the site, said it is filled with "vicious lies" 

              about the institutions and individuals. 

            <P>He is especially offended that the site says Middle East studies 

              has become the preserve of Middle Eastern Arabs who have brought 

              their views with them and that the academics generally seem to dislike 

              the United States. 

            <P>"This imputation of un-Americanism, which is a theme in the writings 

              of these people, is very damaging to our democracy and debate," 

              Khalidi said. "It is a kind of gutter name-calling."
