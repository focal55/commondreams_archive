<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 — As President Bush was cheerily shaking the hands of thousands of guests at glittering White House Christmas parties this week, his advisers and influential Republicans were working overtime to jettison Trent Lott as the Senate Republican leader.</p>

<P> One Republican close to the White House who talked to reporters about the troubles Mr. Lott was bringing upon the party said today that he had been given careful instructions by top White House officials to "stick to the president's words" — meaning that he should take his cues from the president's criticism of Mr. Lott on Dec. 12 in Philadelphia — and to "stay out of the story." That meant critics should remain anonymous when they talked to reporters about Mr. Lott, said this Republican ally of the White House.</p>

<P> By the end of the week, as the White House watched its favorite, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, step up to replace Mr. Lott of Mississippi, Washington's political professionals were left awed. They said Mr. Bush and his powerful political adviser, Karl Rove, had stumbled at times but had still managed to depose in eight short days the unanimously elected Senate leader of their own party.</p>

<P> The president, they said, had ruthlessly maneuvered to contain a stain on Republicans that was threatening his own agenda. And he did it without overtly appearing to be behind the effort.</p>

<P> "They've got a skilled surgeon coming in to run the Senate, and they used a surgeon's skill to remove Lott without leaving any fingerprints," said Robert S. Strauss, the former Democratic National Committee chairman who has been a friend of the Bushes for years. "Whether you agree or disagree with this administration on policy, you have to give the White House tremendous credit for coming to town and after two years having this kind of political performance."</p>

<P> In just eight days, influential Republicans said, the White House used a succession of carefully timed public statements and anonymous, damaging leaks to bring about the resignation of Mr. Lott and the ascension of Mr. Frist, while publicly denouncing the leaks and repeatedly expressing the view that the president did not think Mr. Lott should resign. </p>

<P> "It was a clean extraction," said James Carville, the Democratic strategist, who is married to Mary Matalin, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney.</p>

<P> It was no less than the president himself who began the destruction of Mr. Lott. Last Thursday in Philadelphia, in a sharp rebuke that was the political equivalent of cutting off Mr. Lott's legs, the president said that comments Mr. Lott made on Dec. 5, applauding Senator Strom Thurmond's presidential run in 1948 "do not reflect the spirit of our country" and that "any suggestion that the segregated past was acceptable or positive is offensive and it is wrong."</p>

<P> Republicans said that the condemnation was the idea of Mr. Bush, not Mr. Rove, and that the president was well aware that his words would set in motion a chain of events that were likely to lead to Mr. Lott's resignation. Mr. Bush — who began his political education at the side of Lee Atwater, the bad-boy strategist of the first President Bush's successful 1988 campaign — then immediately ordered his staff to speak no more on the subject.</p>

<P> At that point, Republicans said, no one at the White House had to say a word. "When the president made his statement in Philadelphia, it signaled the White House's view on Lott's continuing as leader," one Republican said. "And it was a strong, unmistakable signal that it would be extraordinarily difficult for Lott to be effective as leader."</p>

<P> The next day, Mr. Lott held a news conference in Mississippi apologizing for his comments. Mr. Bush, meanwhile, headed for a weekend at Camp David and maintained a determined public silence on Mr. Lott. Although Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said after Mr. Lott's news conference that "the president doesn't think Trent Lott needs to resign" (a line Mr. Fleischer repeated all week), not once did the president offer any public support for Mr. Lott.</p>

<P> By Sunday, as the influential Washington Sunday morning talk shows went into overdrive with the news that Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma had called for his colleagues to consider replacing Mr. Lott, Mr. Frist's name had already surfaced. It was put forth by Republicans who were in regular contact with the White House. </p>

<P> "In Washington the river grabs an event and the current just takes it," one of those Republicans said. "The White House doesn't have to do much. But we all knew that the White House had a great relationship with Frist and that it was in the interest of the president and the party to start talking him up."</p>

<P> By Monday, the leaking itself went into overdrive as numerous Republicans from across the country told reporters, always anonymously, that Mr. Lott had no chance of remaining as Senate Republican leader and that the White House wanted him out. The next day, as the White House publicly denounced the leakers, the leaking continued. But now Mr. Rove, who was in close contact with crucial Republicans, was described as "monitoring" the situation, but not trying to influence it. </p>

<P> "He's not standing behind the curtain making the smoke come out and when the smoke comes out, some person engineered by him appears," a Republican said then.</p>

<P> It was critical, Republicans said, that the White House not be seen as interfering in the clubby world of the Senate. They said that any perceived attempts to manipulate a vote were likely to backfire.</p>

<P> By Wednesday, Mr. Lott had been fired upon again, this time publicly by two lethal guns. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he "deplored"' the sentiments behind Mr. Lott's statement, while Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, the president's brother, told The Miami Herald that "something's going to have to change."</p>

<P> "This can't be the topic of conversation over the next week," he said.</p>

<P> By Thursday, Mr. Lott appeared doomed when Mr. Frist became the first Republican to openly challenge him for his post and earned the support of important Republicans. Mr. Frist's candidacy was a relief for White House officials, who had grown increasingly frustrated as Mr. Lott clung to his job and the headlines veered out of their control. Administration officials insisted they had not encouraged Mr. Frist, and had no interest in the outcome of any Senate vote. But Republicans close to the White House, speaking as always anonymously, said Mr. Frist had long been the president's choice. </p>

<P> This evening, another Republican who spoke to reporters as well as to Mr. Rove most days this week said that Mr. Rove had not instructed him what to say to the press about Mr. Lott. "But I've worked with him enough to know that I shouldn't get ahead of the president," the Republican said, "and yet he knows that I'm helping the White House along with what they want to do."</p>
