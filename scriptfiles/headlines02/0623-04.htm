<p>A spokesman for the al-Qaeda network emerged on television to announce that 

chief terror suspect Osama bin Laden and his cohorts were alive and well and warn 

the United States to "fasten its seat belt" in preparation for more attacks.</p>

<p>"Osama bin Laden, (his right-hand man and head of the Egyptian branch of Al-Jihad) Ayman Zawahri and (fugitive Afghan Taliban leader) Mullah (Mohammad) Omar are in good health, contrary to rumors that they were injured in Tora Bora," said Suleiman Abu Ghaith.</p>

<p>"Ninety-eight percent of al-Qaeda leaders escaped unhurt and are running its affairs unaffected" by US bombing raids in Afghanistan, Abu Ghaith said in a lengthy statement aired on the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera satellite channel.</p>

<p>Abu Ghaith referred to "the eight months that have passed" since the United States launched its military campaign in Afghanistan in October, indicating his statement was recorded in June.</p>

<p>"The whole world and the friends of the Mujahedin (Islamic fighters) in the Muslim world will soon have the pleasure of seeing bin Laden on television," added Abu Ghaith, who was stripped of his Kuwaiti citizenship because of his alleged links to the September 11 attacks blamed on al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>The al-Qaeda spokesman also threatened "new attacks against American targets."</p>

<p>"America must prepare itself and fasten its seat belt. We will arrive from where they (the Americans) are not expecting," he warned.</p>

<p>"Yes, we will undertake attacks, but at the right time, in the place we choose and in the manner we want.</p>

<p>"Neither (US Vice President) Dick Cheney nor Defense Secretary (Donald Rumsfeld) nor their president (George W. Bush) will be able to know the place, the time or the manner in which these attacks will be carried out," he said.</p>

<p>"The war against the United States has just started," and al-Qaeda has the means to "stage fresh attacks against US targets," Abu Ghaith said.</p>

<p>"So long as America persists in its unjust policy toward Muslims, we will go on hitting it everywhere ... and we have the means to carry out our threats," he said.</p>

<p>"Our military, security, economic and media capabilities are intact ... Our military and security apparatus is watching over new US targets. Muslims will rejoice," Abu Ghaith said.</p>

<p>Abu Ghaith also claimed responsibility for the April 11 explosion of a fuel tanker near a synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba which killed 19 people, including 14 German tourists, and threatened attacks against "Jewish targets."</p>

<p>"We will not desist from striking at America everywhere ... The whole world will see these are not just threats. The coming days and months will prove to the world the credibility of what we are saying.</p>

<p>"Our (would-be) martyrs are bracing to carry out these operations against US and Jewish targets," he said without elaborating.</p>

<p>The US Federal Bureau of Investigation warned Friday that similar attacks to Djerba might be made "against US interests in the United States or overseas, notably against Jewish schools and synagogues." </p>
