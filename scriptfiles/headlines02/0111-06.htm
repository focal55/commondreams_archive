            LAS VEGAS (CBS.MW) -- Although Enron's large contributions to key 

            legislators and members of the Bush administration apparently were 

            not enough to pull its financial fat out of the fire, one group of 

            major energy-business political donors just hit the jackpot. 

            <p>While it will be at least a decade -- if then -- before radioactive 

              waste begins pouring into Nevada's Yucca Mountain, the Department 

              of Energy's decision to recommend the site is a big victory for 

              the nuclear power industry. </p>

            

<p>Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said Thursday he plans to formally 

              recommend the Silver State site as a new federal repository for 

              nuclear waste -- delighting plant operators and infuriating Nevada 

              businesses, politicians and environmentalists. 

<p>Transporting all of its radioactive byproducts to one central location 

              and storing it there -- both at taxpayer expense -- has long been 

              at the top of the nuclear industry's wish list. Currently, most 

              nuclear waste generated from commercial plants is stored on-site, 

              a cost shouldered by the operators. 

            

<p>The <a href="http://www.nei.org/" target="_new">Nuclear Energy Institute</a> wasted no time in hailing Abraham's 

              decision: "Safely transporting nuclear waste from 35 states to one 

              secure, specifically designed federal disposal facility underground 

              is the best solution to protect our environment and our national 

              security," said Joe Colvin, president of the trade group. 

            

<p><b>Companies backed Senate bid </b>

            

<p>Abraham received thousands of dollars in contributions from the 

              industry in his campaign for reelection to the U.S. Senate from 

              Michigan in 2000. In addition to NEI's $4,000, private nuclear-plant 

              operators DTE Energy, with $5,000, Exelon, at $2,000, Constellation, $2,000, and FirstEnergy, 

              also $2,000, ponied up for his failed bid. 

            

<p>Abraham also accepted at least $9,500 from energy-trading company 

              Enron  between February of 1999 and October 

              2000. 

            <p>Although Attorney General John Ashcroft recently recused himself 

              from involvement in the criminal probe of Enron because he had accepted 

              over $50,000 of the company's money in the past, Joe Davis, a spokesman 

              for the Department of Energy, insisted that Abraham has no such 

              conflict. 

            <p>Abraham based his decision solely on "sound science and compelling 

              interests [of] national security and environmental protection," 

              he said. 

            

<p>While the nuclear industry has given to both major parties, the 

              GOP has long received the lion's share of the booty. For instance, 

              the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/" target="_new">Center for Responsive Politics</a> said that in the last election 

              cycle Republican candidates got more than two-thirds of the $335,000 

              given by NEI and nearly three quarters of $819,000 contributed by 

              leading nuclear operator Exelon. 

            <p>The next call in the ongoing battle will be made by the White House, 

              which is on record as being in favor of both expanded nuclear power 

              and the establishment of a central repository for nuclear waste. 

            <p>If, as expected, the Bush administration approves the site, Nevada's 

              governor or state legislature gets a chance to veto the decision, 

              which will stop the project until and unless Congress overrides 

              it. 

            <p>Furious members of the state's congressional delegation, including 

              Senate Majority Whip Harry Reid, have vowed to do whatever it takes 

              to keep the Yucca from opening. And, even should they fail, Nevada 

              Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, has vowed a court battle.
