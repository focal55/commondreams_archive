</table></font>The 11 yachts have formed a chain in the sea passage between Norfolk and Lord 

Howe Islands, which lie halfway between Australia and New Zealand. 

<P> The freighters are due to pass through the passage at first light on Monday 

(1800GMT Sunday). The environmental group <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org" target="_new">Greenpeace</a> 

says the ships have already reduced their speed, although the protest is a symbolic 

one and they do not expect them to stop. 

<P> Greenpeace says the ships - Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal - are carrying 

enough plutonium waste to make 50 nuclear bombs. 

<P> The organization believes the ships are a potential terrorist target and says 

it wants to stop the South Pacific becoming a nuclear highway. 

<P> The radioactive material is being returned to Britain because Japan found 

that safety documentation with it had been falsified. 

<P> More than 50 protesters are taking part in the Nuclear-Free Seas Flotilla, 

including Ian Cohen, an elected member of the New South Wales parliament in Australia.

<P> The flotilla consists of seven New Zealand yachts, three from Australia and 

one from the tiny pacific islands of Vanuatu. 

<P> They have battled high seas and unpredictable weather for the past two days 

to be ready for the two freighters, which left Japan on 4 July 

<P> A smaller flotilla took part in a protest last year when a nuclear shipment 

from France passed through the Tasman Sea en route to Japan. 

<P> Pacific Island nations have opposed the shipment of nuclear materials through 

their waters.
