<p>WASHINGTON - Seven of the 12 lawmakers who represent Massachusetts in Congress 

say they will vote against a proposed resolution authorizing President Bush to 

use force against Iraq, mainly because the measure would allow the United States 

to launch a unilateral, preemptive attack. 

<P> Opponents of the resolution said they worry that it would mark a dangerous 

departure in US foreign policy and could fuel tensions throughout the Middle East. 

Four other members of the state's all-Democratic delegation said they were undecided, 

and only one, Representative Edward J. Markey of Malden, said he would vote for 

the document, because he is concerned about the possibility Iraq might acquire 

nuclear weapons. 

<P> Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who delivered a sharp rebuke of Bush administration 

policy on Iraq last week, said he would vote against the resolution. The other 

opponents are Representatives William D. Delahunt of Quincy, Barney Frank of Newton, 

James P. McGovern of Worcester, John F. Tierney of Salem, John W. Olver of Amherst, 

and Michael E. Capuano of Somerville. 

<P> Senator John F. Kerry, who has been an outspoken critic of Bush's foreign 

policy and who has strongly urged the administration to develop an international 

coalition to take on Iraq and president Saddam Hussein, said he is still grappling 

with the issue. 

<P> Representatives Martin T. Meehan of Lowell, Richard E. Neal of Springfield, 

and Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston also said they were undecided on whether 

to authorize sending troops into war, or risk hamstringing the president's efforts 

to thwart a possible threat from Iraq. 

<P> The opposition contrasts the strong majorities in the House and Senate expected 

to approve the measure next week. 

<P> ''This vote isn't a party vote. It isn't even a Massachusetts vote. It's a 

vote of conscience,'' McGovern said. ''If they don't like my vote, they can get 

a new congressman. This congressman can't get a new conscience. I couldn't sleep 

at night if I voted for this.'' 

<P> The Senate yesterday began what is expected to be a days-long debate on the 

resolution, which would allow Bush to use force against Iraq if he determines 

diplomatic efforts have failed. In the House, the International Relations Committee 

voted 33-11 to approve the resolution, the contentious product of bipartisan talks 

between the White House and Congress. Delahunt, the only committee member from 

Massachusetts, voted against the resolution. 

<P> ''I said at the outset, this [upcoming] vote is the end of the beginning,'' 

said Senate minority leader Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi. ''Let us ensure 

that by conclusion, we have set in motion the beginning of the end of Saddam Hussein 

and all he stands for.'' 

<P> Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, lashed out at the ''newly 

bellicose mood that permeates this White House,'' and urged his colleagues to 

''resist the siren song of political polls'' and proceed cautiously before sending 

the nation to war. 

<P> ''The resolution before us today is not only a product of haste; it is also 

a product of presidential hubris,'' Byrd, the chamber's most senior Democrat, 

said yesterday on the Senate floor. 

<P> There is still a chance the resolution will be amended before a final vote 

in the House and Senate. But for Massachusetts legislators committed to voting 

''no,'' the document is riddled with objectionable concepts. 

<P> ''It's unfettered unilateralism,'' Capuano said, because Bush would be able 

to order military action without backing from US allies. 

<P> Frank, voicing another concern of opponents, said: ''This resolution gives 

the president the power to invade Iraq, with or without the UN, for the purpose 

of a regime change.'' 

<P> Olver said he worried that an attack would unleash anti-American sentiment 

throughout the Arab world and cause more violence elsewhere. Tierney reflected 

the views of several of his Massachusetts colleagues in stating that the administration 

- which has provided classified briefings to Congress - has not proved an imminent 

threat from Iraq to justify war. 

<P> Said Delahunt: ''This resolution articulates a preemptive doctrine, which 

I believe establishes a profoundly dangerous precedent in international relations.'' 

<P> Kerry has in recent months been a meticulous critic of the president's approach 

to dealing with a possible threat from Iraq, unlike several other Democratic members 

of Congress who are mulling presidential runs. 

<P> Democratic Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John Edwards of 

North Carolina support the resolution under consideration; House minority leader 

Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, helped craft it. Senate majority leader Thomas 

A. Daschle of South Dakota supports an alternative resolution with tighter restrictions 

on Bush's authority to wage war, but he has not said how he will vote on the resolution 

under consideration. 

<P> In an<b> </b>interview with the Globe a month ago, Kerry called the White 

House policy ''a very amateurish and almost irresponsible, relatively cavalier 

way to approach major international issues.'' 

<P> In a recent newspaper opinion piece, Kerry said ''the administration's strategy 

remains adrift.'' 

<P> But as the formal debate began in the Senate, Kerry, officially undecided, 

appeared to be wavering. 

<P> ''I think it's an improvement over what we were given before,'' Kerry said, 

referring to Bush's opening request, which would have given the president far 

more sweeping power to use force. 

<P> ''They've done some of the things we were insisting on,'' he said, such as 

requiring the president to inform Congress of an attack no later than 48 hours 

after the action, and to report to Congress at least once every 60 days about 

the conduct of the mission and plans for dealing with a post-Hussein Iraq. 

<P> Kerry said he has been pleased to see the Bush administration negotiate with 

the United Nations, but said he needs to be convinced that the administration 

is committed to disarmament as a primary goal, instead of regime change. If the 

UN fails to cooperate, ''we always reserve the right to do what we need to do 

to protect our security,'' Kerry said. 

<P> Meehan, Lynch, and Neal said they would prefer a different resolution, but 

could be convinced to vote for the version presented to them. All three said they 

wanted a more multilateral approach to Hussein, and Neal has concerns about a 

postwar Iraq. 

<P> ''The administration's policy is so aggressive on the use of force. It's single-minded,'' 

Lynch said. But he added, ''I don't think it serves the country well to undermine 

the president.'' 

<P> Meehan said he would prefer tighter restrictions on presidential power in 

the resolution. But ''in the end, if diplomacy fails, I do believe the president 

should have the authority to force disarmament,'' he said.
