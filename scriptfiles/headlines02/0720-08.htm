<p>PHILADELPHIA -  Ralph Nader, the longtime consumer activist and Green Party's 2000 presidential candidate, said Friday that current reforms being considered by Congress in the wake of corporate scandals do not go far enough.</p>

<p>Nader, talking to reporters Friday night at the Green Party's 2002 midterm convention in Philadelphia, urged the public to organize to demand even greater changes.</p>

<p>"The one thing that's coming from all over the country ... is that (people) want the corporate crooks to pay back their ill-gotten gains and be sent to jail," Nader said. "Congress is not going to consider that at the present time unless there is a broad mobilization of the public."</p>

<p>Nader said an investor-rights organization is needed along with a congressional commission to investigate the concentration of economic power and its effect upon the economy. Such a panel was set up in 1938 but was disbanded with the outbreak of World War II, he said.</p>

<p>"When millions of Americans lose trillions of dollars and when hundreds of thousands are laid off month after month because their bosses ran their companies into the ground, we've got a major opportunity for change," he told more than 300 people at an evening rally.</p>

<p>Nader said he and other Green Party members spoke out during the 2000 campaign about corporate corruption but the major parties ignored the subject "and the media thought it was a side issue."</p>

<p>Nader was greeted by chants of "Ralph was right" when he stepped up to the podium to speak at the rally.</p>

<p>The event also featured folk music and song parodies, including an anti-World Trade Organization ditty substituting "WTO" in the lyrics to "YMCA."</p>

<p>Also speaking were Medea Benjamin of Global Exchange, a group focusing on human rights and social justice; Michael Morrill, 2002 Green Party candidate for Pennsylvania governor; and Cheri Honkala, director of the Kensington Welfare Rights Union in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The Green Party's midterm convention - traditionally used for organizing the party, not nominating candidates - is designed to teach members how to run better campaigns. The four-day convention ends on Sunday.</p>

<p>More than 350 Green Party candidates will run for office in 39 states this November, triple the number from the last general election, including 15 candidates for governor, 42 for U.S. House seats and six for U.S. Senate seats.</p>

<p>Nader got 3 percent of the national vote in 2000 and 2 percent of the vote 

in Florida, which was decided by only a few hundred votes. Many observers said 

those ballots were likely siphoned off Democratic candidate Al Gore.</p>
