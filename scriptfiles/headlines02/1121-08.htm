<p>GEORGE Bush's top security adviser last night admitted the US would attack 

Iraq even if UN inspectors fail to find weapons.</p>

<p>Dr Richard Perle stunned MPs by insisting a "clean bill of health" from UN 

chief weapons inspector Hans Blix would not halt America's war machine.</p>

<p>Evidence from ONE witness on Saddam Hussein's weapons program will be enough 

to trigger a fresh military onslaught, he told an all- party meeting on global 

security.</p>

<p>Former defense minister and Labour backbencher Peter Kilfoyle said: "America 

is duping the world into believing it supports these inspections. President Bush 

intends to go to war even if inspectors find nothing.</p>

<p>"This make a mockery of the whole process and exposes America's real determination 

to bomb Iraq."</p>

<p>Dr Perle told MPs: "I cannot see how Hans Blix can state more than he can know. 

All he can know is the results of his own investigations. And that does not prove 

Saddam does not have weapons of mass destruction."</p>

<p>The chairman of America's defense policy board said: "Suppose we are able to 

find someone who has been involved in the development of weapons and he says there 

are stores of nerve agents. But you cannot find them because they are so well 

hidden.</p>

<p>"Do you actually have to take possession of the nerve agents to convince? We 

are not dealing with a situation where you can expect co-operation."</p>

<p>Mr Kilfoyle said MPs would be horrified at the admission. He added: "Because 

Saddam is so hated in Iraq, it would be easy to find someone to say they witnessed 

weapons building.</p>

<p>"Perle says the Americans would be satisfied with such claims even if no real 

evidence was produced.</p>

<p>"That's a terrifying prospect."</p>
