<p>BAGHDAD  - War with Iraq, with biological or  chemical agents possibly unleashed, will be a human calamity,  the U.N. refugee chief warned -- exactly a month before a final  arms inspectors' report might trigger a conflict.<p>



		"Believe me, it will be a disaster from a humanitarian  perspective," Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said in a BBC interview.<p>

The potential use of biological or chemical agents in a war with Iraq will be a human calamity, Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warned December 27, 2002 -- exactly a month before a final arms inspectors' report might trigger a conflict. 'Believe me, it will be a disaster from a humanitarian perspective,' Lubbers said in a BBC interview on Friday. Lubbers is pictured at news conference in Islamabad in this April 19, 2002 file photo.

</table></font>He raised the specter that bacteriological or chemical  weapons -- for evidence of which UN inspectors are currently  scouring Iraq -- could be used in a conflict.<p>



		He urged the international community to prevent war, and  not to fight unless Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could not be  disarmed if he still has such weapons, which Saddam denies.<p>



		"Only, only, when Saddam Hussein does not comply with both  the inspections and the consequences of the inspections...then  there can be reason for a military intervention," said Lubbers.<p>



		Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and  a UN mission toured the Modern Company for Brewery and other  sites on Friday as the mission to scour Iraq for traces of  atomic, biological or chemical weapons entered its second  month.<p>



		Iraq said on Thursday the experts had found no evidence of  banned weapons. The inspectors are now starting to interview  scientists who worked on now abandoned weapons programs.<p>



		The 100-plus inspectors -- whose predecessors left the  country in 1998 after Baghdad halted cooperation -- are due to  issue their next report on January 9 and a final one on January  27, with speculation growing this could spark war.<p>



		A UN Security Council resolution last month gave Iraq a  last chance to come clean on its weapons programs -- as  required by resolutions stemming back to the 1991 Gulf War --  or face consequences, which is diplomatic speak for possible  war.<p>



		America, still embroiled in Afghanistan and building up  forces in the Gulf, faced a grave war of words on a new front  as North Korea accused it of rushing into an "extremely  dangerous confrontation" over the communist state's nuclear  plans.<p>



		Keen to win over allies lukewarm about a possible war with  Iraq, Washington sent two senior officials for talks in Turkey  but the key NATO member said it wanted to see the results of  the weapons inspectors' mission before promising any support.<p>



		"Turkey will not finalize its position until the UN  Security Council's decision," said government leader Tayyip  Erdogan.<p>



		"The report by the UN inspectors about weapons of mass  destruction has not been submitted yet."<p>



		Iraq says the United States is planning to attack it  regardless of the findings of the weapons inspectors.<p><p align="center">Copyright 2002 Reuters Ltd</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
