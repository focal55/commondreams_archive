UNITED NATIONS -- Iraq has asked the United Nations whether U.S. actions toward Saddam Hussein violate international law, according to documents obtained yesterday.

<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan passed this and 18 other questions posed by Iraq to the U.N. Security Council, asking for "any response" it might want to provide by April 10.</p>

<p>The questions were given to Annan by Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri during talks earlier this month focusing on the return of weapons inspectors. A second round of U.N.-Iraq talks is expected to be held April 18.</p>

<p>Annan said the initial meeting with Sabri had been "a good start." But it produced no sign that Iraq would allow weapons inspectors to return -- the first step toward lifting 11-year-old U.N. sanctions that have had dire consequences for Iraqi civilians -- and a key demand of the United States and other council members.</p>

<p>According to U.N. reports, Iraq's infant and child population has been especially hard hit, with some 2,690 to 5,357 dying each month from waterborne and malnutrition-related diseases.</p>

<p>Inspectors left Baghdad before the United States and Britain carried out air strikes in December 1998 to punish Iraq for not cooperating with the inspection program. Saddam's government has barred them from returning.</p>

<p>President Bush has warned Saddam that he faces unspecified consequences if he fails to let inspectors into Iraq to verify whether it has dismantled its weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>Sabri also asked how Iraq's relationship with the Security Council could be normalized "under the present declared U.S. policy," which he claimed was aimed at overthrowing Saddam. And he asked if this violated international law.</p>

<p>Sabri's questions did not rule out allowing the return of weapons inspectors but indicated that Iraq wants inspections to be conducted for a limited time period and lead to certification that the country is free of weapons of mass destruction -- the key condition for lifting sanctions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, yesterday, the International Herald Tribune carried a full-page ad demanding the immediate lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq.</p>

<p>Signatories included Nobel Peace laureates, government officials, and religious leaders, as well as four Seattle-area residents: Kate Pflaumer, former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington; Dr. Robert Haynes, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War; Dick Blakney, Interfaith Network of Concern for the People of Iraq (a program of the Church Council of Greater Seattle); and Bert Sacks, Citizens Concerned for the People of Iraq.</p>

<p>The ad was also signed by people who worked for the U.N. in Iraq, including Denis Halliday, Hans Von Sponeck and Jutta Burkhardt, senior former U.N. officials who resigned in protest over the continuation of the sanctions policy.</p>
