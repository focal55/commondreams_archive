Home was so close -- but Raud couldn't get there.

<P>The 9-year-old boy had wandered away from his parents' house near 

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's compound last weekend, when Israeli troops 

briefly lifted the nearly three-week curfew in this West Bank town. But when 

Raud tried to get home a few hours later, Israeli soldiers who encircled the 

neighborhood stopped him and told him he must turn back.

</table></font>Stranded by a barricade made of demolished cars, rubble and stones, his 

chin drooping, his eyes filled with tears and fear, Raud was living one of 

childhood's worst nightmares.

<P>Then Mikel Jakubal stepped in.

<P>The 39-year-old resident of the Humboldt County town of Garberville had 

arrived in Israel two weeks ago on a mission to help Palestinian civilians in 

the West Bank.

<P>"Since the United States is supplying bullets and guns, I figured I could 

come here and provide a little help," reasoned Jakubal, who is trained in 

emergency medical assistance and volunteers for his firefighters' brigade back 

in Northern California.

<P>Jakubal took young Raud by the elbow and pulled out a large white kerchief. 

He walked, slowly but firmly, up the hill toward the boy's home.

<P>An Israeli tank stopped them, but Jakubal yelled a description of his 

errand to the soldiers inside, all the time fluttering the kerchief and 

holding Raud's arm. A minute later, man and boy were waved through.

<P>When he returned to the barricade alone, Jakubal looked happy.

<P>"I did something useful today," he said, "as little as it was."

<P>Until last week, Israel had for 23 days essentially sealed off the 

Palestinian territories and introduced a curfew in the West Bank's largest 

towns. About two weeks ago, many Palestinian homes in the besieged towns began 

to run out of food, water and medicine.

<P>Jakubal's self-imposed quest -- financed with money he had earned making 

lumber with a portable sawmill -- took him to Bethlehem, where Israeli forces 

have been locked in an armed standoff with about 200 Palestinians holed up in 

the Church of the Nativity.

<P>The task taken on by Jakubal and a group of volunteers from the 

International Solidarity Movement, a peace group that protests the Israeli 

presence in the Palestinian territories, was to deliver a food shipment from 

the United Nations to Bethlehem residents who had run out of supplies.

<P>U.N. workers "didn't want to go in because there was gunfire," recalled 

Jakubal, a skinny, balding man with a ginger ponytail.

<P>"We delivered 13  110-pound bags of food for people who had been under 

curfew for two weeks," he said with satisfaction.

<P>The 10-minute incursion into a restricted area nearly cost Jakubal his life.

<P>As the volunteers were giving out rice and flour to the Palestinians, Israeli 

soldiers opened fire with M-16 assault rifles.

<P>Jakubal was not wearing a flak jacket, but no one was hurt.

<P>"Couldn't afford one," he said, smiling. "I'd rather rely on my wits and 

good luck."

<P>An element of adventure played an important role in Jakubal's decision to 

come here, he admitted.

<P>"I like being on the edge of things. Life starts getting too petty unless I 

do something outside my little life," Jakubal explained. "I like feeling 

confident in really tight situations -- and here's actually a place where I 

can do some help."

<P>Jakubal brought along with him a large backpack containing a basic first-

aid kit: scissors, wound dressings, aspirin and antibiotic cream. He wanted to 

go first to the Jenin refugee camp, the site of fierce Palestinian resistance 

and Israeli military attacks, to aid wounded civilians.

<P>But by the time he got into the camp, "Everyone who had been wounded was 

either dead or gone."

<P>He ended up helping local doctors and Red Cross workers distribute food and 

water to surviving residents who wandered among the ruins of their houses, 

looking for their dead in the dusty rubble.

<P>The Palestinians charge that Israel committed a "massacre" in the Jenin 

camp, killing hundreds of civilians. Israel denies the massacre allegation, 

saying that only dozens -- mostly Palestinian gunmen -- died.

<P>Jakubal said that after spending three days helping doctors and aid workers 

at the camp, he realized he could give something to the local residents that 

was as important as first aid: attention that allowed them to talk about their 

sorrow.

<P>"One thing I discovered on this trip is that people are so grateful if you 

just sit down and listen to them," Jakubal said. "Everywhere I went, everybody 

said, 'Thank you, thank you for being here, thank you for listening.' "</p>
