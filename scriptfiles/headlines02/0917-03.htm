<p>Iraq has removed any excuse for a US-led war by agreeing to new UN weapons inspections, Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The excuse used to launch an aggression has been totally blocked," Aziz told a gathering of political supporters in Baghdad.</p>

<p>"They (the Americans) thought Iraq wouldn't take such a courageous decision," as accepting the return of UN arms inspectors, Aziz said.</p>

<p>UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Monday he had received a letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri informing him of Baghdad's decision to allow the return of the weapons inspectors "without conditions".</p>

<p>The letter said Iraq wanted to start immediate discussions on practical arrangements for the return of the inspectors, and "remove any doubts that Iraq still possesses weapons of mass destruction."</p>

<p>"Immediately after the announcement by Baghdad (in New York), the White House rejected the decision," Aziz said.</p>

<p>Washington "has been shocked by this courageous decision," he said. "We are serious and ready to assume (responsibilities). We are completely ready to cooperate with the United Nations."</p>

<p>The White House branded Iraq's offer "a tactic that will fail" to prevent UN action to disarm Baghdad and called for a tough new Security Council resolution to deal with President Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>Aziz added that "all weapons of mass destruction in Iraq have been completely destroyed. Even tools and buildings housing equipment have been destroyed."</p>

<p>The minister also accused US President George W. Bush of "wanting to make Iraq a new Afghanistan."</p>

<p>"The objective of US policy (towards Iraq) is aimed at controlling oil in the 

Gulf," Aziz warned.</p>
