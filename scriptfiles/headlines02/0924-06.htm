Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel carried a cartoon yesterday showing a panting Joschka 

Fischer racing towards a finishing line with a smiling Gerhard Schr&#246;der in 

his arms."I knew we'd make it," the chancellor is saying. 

<P>The Greens in general, and the party's leader, Joschka Fischer, in particular 

did indeed carry the center-left to victory on Sunday night. As Mr Fischer noted, 

the party secured every one of its objectives. 

<P>It won more than 8% of the vote; it remained the fourth-biggest party after 

the Social Democrats (SPD), the CDU and the Bavarian CSU, and - above all - its 

success ensured the survival of the "red-green" coalition. 

<P>But Mr Fischer sent a veiled warning to his followers yesterday not to provoke 

their Social Democrat allies. He said that, after their outstanding performance, 

he saw "no reason for flexing our muscles". 

<P>A fourth seat at the cabinet table may well be in the offing. Franz M&#252;ntefering, 

the Social Democrats' general secretary, did not rule out that possibility yesterday. 

<P>The Green party, however, will also be seeking to introduce even more of its 

ideas into the government program than it did four years ago. 

<P>Fritz Kuhn, the party's joint leader, said it would be approaching the coalition 

negotiations "in a friendly and constructive fashion", but with a "detailed strategy". 

<P>Such an approach could lead to friction. The Green party, for example, wants 

to keep up the phased rise in the German fossil fuel levy, the so-called "eco-tax" 

- the Social Democrats pledged to cap it after 2003. The SPD is committed to military 

conscription. The Greens want it scrapped. 

<P>But, said Mr Schr&#246;der, "anyone who thinks there will be big problems in 

the negotiations is going to be disappointed". 

<P>That may have been more than just spin. The campaign saw a visible growing 

together of the red and green elements. 

<P>Mr Schr&#246;der made two key Green causes his own: opposition to war, in his 

denial of troops for an invasion of Iraq, and concern for the environment, in 

the form of a commitment to alternative energy. 

<P>His new government may be weaker because it will have a smaller majority, but 

a greater common purpose may give it more strength. 

<P>In some areas, those in which he faces resistance from the SPD "old guard", 

Mr Schr&#246;der may welcome the excuse of Green pressure. 

<P>"Schr&#246;der does not need to reform his own party because he has the Greens," 

said Claus Leggewie, a political science professor at Giessen university. 

<P>The Greens' economic policy, for example, has elements of liberalism as well 

as anti-globalization. It did not feature much in the last government's program, 

as all economic portfolios were held by independents or Social Democrats. 

<P>But Mr Fischer dropped some hints yesterday suggesting that he would like that 

to change. 

<P>"We want to bring on the modernization of our country and take up the globalization 

question," he said. Some of the most important issues, he added, included "structural 

reform" in the environment and the economy. 

<P> Paul Brown adds: Penny Kemp, chairwoman of the UK Green party, said: "People 

are beginning to link disasters, like the flooding, and economic issues. The floods 

came at an important time for Green electoral fortunes, particularly in the old 

East Germany, which was worst hit. 

<P>"In Europe, and indeed worldwide, it is part of an increasingly solid Green 

vote. 

<P>"We have had recent successes as far apart as Taiwan and Mexico as people begin 

to see the link between the environment and economic well being.

<P>"We are no longer seen as a single-issue party, but a party with an alternative 

social agenda which includes peace."</p>
