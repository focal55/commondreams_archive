BRUSSELS - European Union Environment Ministers are meeting on Monday (17 October) to agree a European 
strategy for the next United Nations climate negotiations, which take 
place in Montreal, Canada next month.

<p>The meeting takes place amidst fears that the international leadership 
previously demonstrated by the EU on climate change may now be watered 
down. There appears to be low ambitions within the EU on future UN 
negotiations on climate change, and unwillingness to set themselves 
robust future targets. Friends of the Earth says that such an attitude 
would be disastrous: unless tough action is urgently taken, the impacts 
will be severe for the entire world.

<p>Catherine Pearce, Friends of the Earth International Climate Campaigner 
said:

<p>"Warnings about the terrible impacts of climate change are growing 
louder every day. If we are to avoid a climatic disaster the European 
Union must continue to push for tough international action to tackle 
emissions. Unless the world takes urgent action to cut its emissions, 
the economic, environmental and human costs will be enormous."

<p>*BACKGROUND BRIEFING*

<p>*Meeting of the EU Environment Council - Monday 17 October, Luxembourg*

<p>On 17 October, the 25 EU Environment Ministers (plus Romania and 
Bulgaria) will meet in Luxembourg, where they are due to agree the EU 
position for the upcoming United Nations climate negotiations (COP11 - 
COP/MOP1), which will take place in Montreal between 28 November and 8 
December 2005.

<p>But Friends of the Earth fears that the EU will abandon its leadership 
role at the international negotiations, despite growing signs that 
climate change is proceeding apace and people are feeling the impacts of 
more intense extreme weather events such as storms, floods, droughts or 
heat waves.

<p>The meeting will be chaired by UK environment minister Elliott Morley 
(the UK holds the EU Presidency). The UK has made climate change one of 
its priority areas for international action. However, last month Tony 
Blair raised concerns by appearing to shift toward a more Bush-friendly 
view of tackling global warming: against treaties and targets for 
cutting emissions and toward technological solutions [1]. He told a 
conference in New York "to be honest, I don't think people are going, at 
least in the short term. to start negotiating another major treaty like 
Kyoto"

<p>UK Secretary of State for the Environment Margaret Beckett said in a 
speech last week [2] to a business audience that "we set ourselves the 
objective of securing a final deal by 2010". But Friends of the Earth 
says this is far too late. If we want an agreed a framework which begins 
in 2012 (when the current phase of the Kyoto treaty ends), a "final 
deal" must be secured much earlier.

<p>*The 11th Conference of the Parties in Montreal, Canada (28 November - 8 
December 2005)*

<p> From 28 November to 8 December, governments will meet in Montreal, 
Canada at the United Nations climate negotiations. The meeting is 
critical for future international action on climate change, because 
negotiations will begin on carbon dioxide reduction targets when the 
first commitment period of Kyoto ends in 2012. Ministers from around the 
world are due to join the negotiations from 7-9 December.

<p>Critical agenda items also include compliance with and legal enforcement 
of the Kyoto Protocol, the capacity and role of the established funds 
for adaptation in developing countries and a review of the adequacy of 
existing targets, including demonstrating progress by the 36 countries 
in meeting their targets. EU countries must cut their emissions by an 
average of eight per cent by 2012 compared to 1990 levels.

<p>*What the EU must do*

<p>The EU must agree a pro-active and ambitious agenda for the upcoming 
negotiations.

<p>Economic fears over setting tougher concerns are misguided. These 
concerns ignore the huge financial impacts that climate change will have 
on the world, as well as the economic potential for climate change 
mitigation such as triggering innovation as well as economic gains in a 
world that will increasingly need cleaner energy.

<p>To strengthen leadership at the UN climate negotiations, the EU 
Environment Ministers must adopt the draft conclusions [3] for the 17 
October meeting. These are:
<li>Explicitly agree that the EU aims for negotiations on a new commitment 
period for the Kyoto Protocol, directly following the first one, to be 
held under the Protocol and to be completed by 2008 at the latest.
<li>Maintain and strengthen the reference to both the mid-and long-term 
greenhouse gas reduction needs, i.e. at least minus 30% by 2020 and 
minus 80% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. It should be made clear that 
a new commitment phase will mean absolute and mandatory emission cuts by 
industrialised countries. Targets must be based on accumulated, historic 
per capita emissions as well as on economic capacity to act.
<li>Explicitly refer to the need that in any future climate regime 
industrialised countries must provide finance and technology transfer, 
to enable poor countries to choose climate-friendly development.
<li>Include a reference to the need to reform the Clean Development 
Mechanism, part of the Kyoto Protocol, so that it really delivers 
sustainable development.
<li>Explicitly acknowledge the obligation to compensate those affected by 
climate change in developing countries. Appropriate funding for 
adaptation and disaster relief must become a binding commitment for the 
industrialised nations under the climate regime.
