<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 1 -- Today, The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) called on the United States Senate to send the nomination of Alberto Gonzales for Attorney General back to the Judiciary Committee for further consideration. The national advocacy voice of the interfaith movement, TIA also called on the White House and the Justice Department to release all documents requested by Senators and asked that Gonzales be required to fully answer the questions he evaded in the first hearing and in his written responses to Senator's questions. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TIA also requested its members to contact their Senators. With 150,000-plus individual members and 47 local alliances in 38 states, TIA represents Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists, and other religious and non-religious Americans who support religious liberty, the constitutional cornerstone of American democracy. <br> <br> &quot;Ignoring the Geneva Conventions banning torture is not only a violation of international law, it violates America's commitment to moral values and human rights,&quot; said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance. &quot;Millions of Americans have questions they can never ask Cabinet nominees. Those questions can only be asked on their behalf by their Senators who should be thorough in requiring Judge Gonzales to answer with the whole truth. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Evasive half-answers to questions from Senators is not acceptable,&quot; Gaddy said.  &quot;Saying 'I don't recall' is not acceptable. As the nominee to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Judge Gonzales must not be allowed to plead the Fifth Amendment, in essence, in order to avoid taking responsibility for his actions, his policies, and his counsel to the president. The American people deserve no less than honest and complete answers and a full and open debate on the nomination.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Fighting terror with our own terror, torture, and murder is not worthy of this nation. It is unconscionable and must be stopped. These policies have reversed America's previous commitment to moral values and human rights and have damaged efforts to work with other nations, particularly with the Muslim world,&quot; said Gaddy, one of 20 international religious leaders on the World Economic Forum's Council of 100 Leaders, which was created to work for better understanding and dialogue between Western and Islamic nations. &quot;The policies have been widely condemned by our own courts, military leaders, religious leaders, and the international community.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In December, Gaddy wrote to each Judiciary Committee member requesting that Judge Gonzales be asked specific questions on religious liberty, separation of government and religion, criminal justice reform, and how his own faith would impact his duties as Attorney General. <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=8dJIIWMCE&b=258308&ct=323110" target="_new">www.interfaithalliance.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=8dJIIWMCE&amp;b=258308&amp;ct=323110</a>  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gaddy and 225 other religious leaders signed a letter of grave concern to Judge Gonzales. The letter was released by Church Folks for a Better America. <a href="http://www.cfba.info/analyst/Gonzales_letter.html" target="_new">www.cfba.info/analyst/Gonzales_letter.html</a> <br>	<br>The Interfaith Alliance also joined with a growing number of coalitions of religious groups in renewing the call for the Senate to fully examine the positions of Judge Gonzales. The coalitions include Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and Christian groups, including Catholics, evangelical Christians, and most Protestant denominations. <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=8dJIIWMCE&b=258308&ct=335411" target="_new">www.interfaithalliance.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=8dJIIWMCE&amp;b=258308&amp;ct=335411</a> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a nonpartisan, grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote a narrow, divisive agenda. With more than 150,000 members drawn from more than 75 faith traditions, and 47 local alliances, TIA promotes compassion, civility and mutual respect for human dignity in our increasingly diverse society. <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/" target="_new">www.interfaithalliance.org</a></i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
