<p>WASHINGTON – Since July/August 2005, several hundred men held at the Guantánamo Bay prison camp have staged a desperate and, now, life-threatening hunger strike in  protest of their continued unlawful detention and continued violations of their human rights. Many of the detainees have stated that they are now prepared to die if they do not receive a fair hearing and humane treatment. On November 1, 2005, during the last days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the Center for Constitutional Rights will sponsor a day-long Fast for Justice in solidarity with their clients at Guantánamo.

 

<p>The purpose of the Fast for Justice, which will take place outside the Justice Department, is to draw attention to the men’s plight.  CCR is calling on the U.S. to:

 

<p>
<ul>
<li>give the detainees a fair hearing and immediately release those who have committed no crime;</li>
<li>provide adequate food, water, shelter, medical treatment and the observance of religious practices;</li>
<li> provide to families and legal counsel timely reports on the health status of detainees, especially those  participating in the hunger strike, as ordered by the court; and</li>
<li>provide independent investigators (domestic and international) access to all detainees.</li>
</ul>
