<p>WASHINGTON - Government leaders in Montreal today (Saturday 10th December 2005) reached a 
historic agreement on future action to tackle climate change.  The Montreal 
Action Plan (MAP) was concluded despite a last minute intervention from 
Russia which almost resulted in deadlock.

<p>Negotiators worked through Friday night to reach a progressive agreement 
under the Kyoto Protocol, which will lead to deeper emissions cuts in the 
next commitment period, which starts in 2013.  This Kyoto deal initiates 
crucial negotiations on legally binding targets for industrialised countries 
and also sets in motion a wider review of the entire regime involving all 
countries, due to be discussed at talks next year.

<p>Agreement was also reached under the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) despite the reluctance of the United States administration, 
which put forward new text to weaken the deal.

<p>Friends of the Earth International Vice Chair Tony Juniper said: "Despite Russia's attempt to wreck the deal, this meeting has made a 
historic agreement which will strengthen global resolve with legally-binding 
targets to take action to tackle climate change under the Kyoto Protocol.   
It has sent a clear signal that the future lies in cleaner and more 
sustainable technologies and is good news for people everywhere.

<p>"We expected progress under the Convention, but the US administration 
effectively forced the rest of the world to bend over backwards to keep them 
on board. The result is a very weak deal."

<p>Friends of the Earth International Climate Change Campaigner Catherine 
Pearce said:
"Scientific evidence clearly demands urgent action to cut the pollution that 
is warming our world.  The international community has wisely taken these 
warnings seriously by agreeing to further action.  This is a clear signal 
that the Kyoto agreement is alive and well. Leaders have shown that 
much-needed progress can be made.  The Government of Canada deserves real 
praise for the role it played in making the Montreal meeting a success."

<p>Late night drama (Thursday) saw the United States delegation leave the 
talks, in an effort to collapse negotiations under both the UN Framework 
Convention and the Kyoto Protocol.  On Friday further attempts to block 
progress saw the United States delegation table new draft text, further 
diluting the meaning of the deal.

<p>But strong leadership from the Canadian President and clear resolve from 
other countries, including Britain, Japan and major developing countries, 
particularly Brazil and South Africa, made progress possible.

<p>Countries signed up to the Kyoto Protocol (all major industrialised and 
developing countries, except the USA and Australia) have agreed to ensure 
new targets on cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will be in place to 
immediately follow the first commitment phase in 2012.

<p>Rules governing the Kyoto Protocol's operation (the Marrakesh Accords) were 
agreed in Montreal, including the legally binding nature of the regime. 
Countries also agreed to a review of both the Kyoto Protocol and Framework 
Convention to start next year.

<p>An agreement was also reached on reform of the "Clean Development Mechanism" 
(the mechanism allowing industrialised countries to claim carbon credits by 
investing in clean energy projects in the developing world).  But concerns 
remain about what this includes and what will be delivered.
