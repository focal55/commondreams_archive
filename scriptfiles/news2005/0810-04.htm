<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO / LOS ANGELES -- August 10 -- Tides Foundation today announced that its Kendeda Sustainability Fund has awarded $2.1 million to American Public Media to support expanded news coverage and programming on global sustainability and the economy.  </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The grant will primarily support the creation of a new desk for American Public Media&rsquo;s Marketplace business programs, including Marketplace&trade;, Marketplace Morning Report&trade;, and Marketplace Money&trade;, a personal finance program. With a weekly audience of more than 8.5 million, the combined Marketplace programs have more listeners than any other business news program on television or radio. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new editorial desk will focus on covering sustainability and the economy, including environmental, economic, technological, cultural and other factors influencing the future of humanity. Coverage will be aimed at helping the public better understand global realities that affect domestic and international economies and cultures. The grant, which will be disbursed over three years, will enable Marketplace to seek out diverse perspectives on sustainability related topics. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;Nothing is more important to the future of the economy and, ultimately, to our survival than awareness of how our actions affect global sustainability,&rdquo; said JJ Yore, executive producer of Marketplace and vice president, programming, for American Public Media. &ldquo;Through this generous grant, we gain the resources to give these issues the attention they deserve.&rdquo; </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;More businesses today are contemplating a &lsquo;double bottom line&rsquo;&mdash;how their activities impact their profitability and the greater social good. This was almost unthinkable 20 years go,&rdquo; said Idelisse Malav&eacute;, executive director, Tides Foundation. &ldquo;People are adopting a broader view of their activities and how their decisions today will affect all of us tomorrow. Yet this has been a neglected perspective in the news media. We are very excited to support an expanded analysis of major business trends from such a respected and independent news source.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The grant also will fund coverage of sustainability on other American Public Media programs, including American RadioWorks documentaries; Speaking of Faith, a program on belief, meaning, ethics and ideas; and Weekend America, a magazine show which explores lifestyle, leisure, culture and attitude. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;By providing support for sustainability coverage on these programs, the Tides Foundation grant provides a groundbreaking opportunity to reach a large and important audience,&rdquo; said Jon McTaggart, senior vice president and chief operating officer of American Public Media. &ldquo;Our ability to serve the public will be significantly enhanced as we offer coverage on sustainability across many programs, from many perspectives and at different times of the day and week,&rdquo; said McTaggart. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Kendeda Sustainability Fund, a donor-advised fund at Tides Foundation, was created in 2003 to explore how to live within the limits of the natural world in ways that promote community, equity, prosperity and health. It funds organizations in the areas of higher education, religion and faith, healthy buildings, materials and processes, and communications/media and the arts.</font></p>

It supports activities in the areas of economic and social justice, environmental sustainability and democratic renewal.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marketplace, produced in Los Angeles, maintains five domestic bureaus plus bureaus in London and Tokyo. The 16-year-old program has been called the best business show on radio or television by the Columbia Journalism Review, and it has won the duPont-Columbia Award and the Peabody Award. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marketplace is distributed worldwide by American Public Media. It is broadcast by more than 325 public radio stations and heard around the world via American Forces Radio &amp; Television Service.
