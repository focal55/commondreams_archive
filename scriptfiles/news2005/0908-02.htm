<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> WASHINGTON - September 8 - Parents, Families and  Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) is stunned, saddened and  angered that Governor Schwarzenegger has signaled a decision to  veto the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act  before it has even reached his desk and before speaking with the  families that will be affected.
<p>   PFLAG executive director, Jody Huckaby, expressed exasperation  today saying, &quot;This is tremendously frustrating.  We are getting  such mixed signals.  Some say it is up to the voters to pass  judgment on the basic human rights of a minority -- a position  that anyone should be able to see is flawed.  Others say it is up  to the duly elected representatives to pass laws that ensure our  nation's promise of equality and justice for all -- a position we  certainly agree with.  And now Governor Schwarzenegger is saying  it is up to the courts to settle the matter!  We call upon the  Governor to be a statesman, show some real historic leadership,  and do what is right for hundreds of thousands of California  families.  Don't veto this bill.&quot;</p>
<p>   Today, California PFLAG Advocacy Coordinator, Eve Lubalin,  wrote to the Governor on behalf of the 40 PFLAG chapters in the  state.  In part she wrote:</p>
<p>   &quot;We ask you to consider how you would feel if one of your  children (or future grandchildren) tells you one day that they  are gay or lesbian in their sexual orientation.  Would you want  them to face discrimination, loss of full civil rights, and be  unable to protect their families because of prejudice or  homophobia?  As you enjoy your family life and marital union, we  hope you will remember the tens of thousands of LGBT families who  you would deny the security and safety net your family takes for  granted.&quot;</p>
<p>   Huckaby said, &quot;Our families and friends in California have  experienced a moment's taste of the respect and dignity afforded  by the vote of the Assembly.  In the big picture, there is no  going back.&quot;</p>
