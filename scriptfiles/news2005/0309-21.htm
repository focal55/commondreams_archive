<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- March 9 -- Marking two years since the U.S.-led bombing and invasion of Iraq began, peace groups are planning actions for March 18-20 under the banner, &quot;The World Says End the War!&quot;  United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), the national anti-war coalition, is helping coordinate a growing list of over 250 protests in the U.S. that will call for the troops to be brought home now.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In at least 45 states, the anti-war movement will send a message to the Bush administration and the world: End this pointless and costly war.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The weekend will feature an array of vibrant events ranging from marches and rallies to silent vigils, civil disobedience actions, interfaith services, musical and theatre performances, and art exhibits.  Events will take place on main streets and courthouse squares, alongside highways and bridges, in public parks and in front of military recruiting stations, at statehouses and Congressional offices.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An up-to-date list of U.S. and international actions is online at: <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" target="_new">http://www.unitedforpeace.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The planned protests will highlight the Iraq occupation's continuing human and financial costs.  $154 billion has already been spent; Bush now has a request before Congress for an additional $82 billion, and there is no end in sight.  U.S. military deaths have surpassed 1,500 with at least 11,000 injured; more than 16,000 Iraqi civilians have died.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A major regional protest spearheaded by military families and veterans will take place in Fayetteville, NC, home of the Fort Bragg U.S. Army base. Busloads of people are traveling to Fayetteville from throughout the South, and as far away as New York City and Minnesota.  Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW) will join the demonstration and afterwards have its first national gathering. Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) will also meet in Fayetteville.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>United for Peace and Justice is the largest U.S. peace and justice coalition with more than 1,000 groups under its umbrella.  Since its founding in October 2002, UFPJ has spurred hundreds of protests and rallies around the country, including the two largest demonstrations against the Iraq war.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
