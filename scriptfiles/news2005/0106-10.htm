The event is open to media, and is part of the 84th annual Transportation Research Board (TRB) meeting.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHEN:</b> Sunday, January 9, 2005<br>09:00 a.m. to 05:30 p.m.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHERE:</b> Washington Hilton Hotel (International West Ballroom)<br>1919 Connecticut Ave., NW, Washington, D.C.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHY:</b> Urban transportation in Latin America has received considerable attention in the past few years, particularly with a focus on new air-pollution programs in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Bus rapid transit successes have occurred in several Brazilian cities as well as Bogota, Colombia.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EMBARQ has invited some of the most influential Latin American leaders in the transport field to share their experiences. They will be joined by transportation experts from the U.S. and other countries gathered for the annual TRB meeting. For the day's schedule and speakers, visit http://embarq.wri.org/en/ConferencesDe tail.aspx?ID=25.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Lee Schipper, EMBARQ's research director, says, &quot;One of the key questions on our minds is whether Latin American cities can be re-conquered from cars. Typically, only 20 percent of the trips made in Mexico City or Sao Paulo are by car - as opposed to nearly 90 percent in the U.S. - yet cars manage to take most of the road space and cause enormous congestion, slowing down the majority of people who are on the bus and crowding those trying to walk or bike. These cars also account for most of the smog from vehicles.&quot; </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
