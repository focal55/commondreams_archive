<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KABUL / BRUSSELS - July 22  -  In September 2005 Afghans will go to the polls to elect the National Assembly and Provincial Councils in a vote that will be crucial in consolidating Afghanistan's fragile political transition.<P align=justify>"These elections stand as both a testing ground and incentive for a number of programs to build security in Afghanistan and stabilise the transition", says Crisis Group Senior Analyst Joanna Nathan. "The opportunity for a major step forward in September is there, but so too is the risk the elections will fail to provide adequate momentum to build up the Afghan state and re-enforce its legitimacy."</P><P align=justify><A href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?l=1&amp;id=3579" target="">Afghanistan Elections: Endgame or New Beginning?</A>,* the latest report from the International Crisis Group, explores the obstacles to a successful elections and suggests the steps that need to be taken to overcome them. </P><P align=justify>Since his official inauguration in 2004, President Hamid Karzai has been the almost exclusive focus of the Afghan state. What is needed now is a major strengthening of the country's institutional capacity, and sustained international support in achieving that objective.</P><P align=justify>"Until the central government inspires trust locally there will continue to be a risk of a return to factional violence; until impunity is ended at all levels of administration there will continue to be a risk of human rights abusers becoming elected officials," says Samina Ahmed, Director of Crisis Group's South Asia project, pointing to the vetting process for the elections in which just 17 people were excluded. "Stability and justice have been seen as mutually exclusive. Actually they are twin goals which reinforce each other and ensure the security of the population and the legitimacy of the state."</P><P align=justify>It is particularly worrying that the electoral system now in place excludes political parties&nbsp;-- essential in any functioning democracy&nbsp;-- and favours narrow ethnic interests at the expense of broad-based constituencies. Little groundwork has been laid for the new institutions to flourish, indeed elections for Provincial Councils must be some of the few polls in the world for bodies of which the powers are not known.</P><P align=justify>However, it is not too late to address these and other concerns, strengthening the electoral process for both this and future elections, and improving the chances that Afghanistan's new institutions will be able to sustain the peace. </P><P align=justify>All of this will require strong international support, but, according to Ahmed, "the costs of allowing Afghanistan's political transition to falter are too high for the international community to ignore."</P></font><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
