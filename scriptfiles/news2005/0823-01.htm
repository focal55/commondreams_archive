<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 23 -   Green Party leaders are challenging MoveOn.org to 
support an immediate pullout of troops from Iraq.

<p>"MoveOn has done an admirable job of rallying people nationwide behind Cindy 
Sheehan's protest vigil in Crawford, Texas," said Rebecca Rotzler, co-chair 
of the Green Party of the United States and Deputy Mayor of New Paltz, New 
York.  "But MoveOn itself has undermined such efforts by refusing to endorse 
an immediate end to the occupation of Iraq."

<p>Journalist Norman Solomon has noted that MoveOn declined to support a 
resolution from Rep. Lynn Woolsey stating that "the president should develop 
and implement a plan to begin the immediate withdrawal of United States 
Armed Forces from Iraq" and Rep. Barbara Lee's (D-Calif.) bill to block the 
establishment of permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq (<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0818-33.htm">"The Iraq War and 
MoveOn", Common Dreams, August 18<http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0818-33.htm></a>).

<p>Several Green Party members, including Ms. Rotzler (who also serves as 
co-chair of the Green Party's Peace Action Committee), Andrea Garland of New 
Orleans, and Mato Ska of Phoenix have traveled to Crawford to join Cindy 
Sheehan's vigil at 'Camp Casey' near Mr. Bush's ranch, while thousands of 
other Greens participated in support vigils across the U.S. on August 17.

<p>The Peace Action Committee issued a <a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2005_08_10.shtml" target="_new">statement</a> in support of the Camp Casey 
vigil, which Ms. Rotzler 
presented to Ms. Sheehan.

<p>"We challenge MoveOn to listen to its own membership, and take a stand 
against the invasion and continued occupation of Iraq," said Ms. Garland.

<p>Greens have rejected the claim of Democrats like Senators Hillary Clinton 
(NY) and Joe Biden (Del.) that the problem with the Iraq War is the Bush 
Administration's military miscalculations.

<p>"The invasion and occupation are crimes, based on deception about the 
motivations for the invasion, a radical ideology that embraces 'preventive 
war' -- condemned by international law after World War II -- and an oil 
grab," said Leenie Halbert, Louisiana Green and member of the party's 
International Committee.  "This abuse of power was inevitable after most 
Democrats in October 2002 voted with Republicans to surrender Congress's 
constitutionally mandated power to declare war to the White House."
