<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 12 -- Hundreds of thousands of activists from the Win Without War coalition have called on members of the U.S. Senate to condition support of the Bush administration&#146;s $82 billion supplemental appropriation request for Iraq on an exit strategy for military forces and a declaration that the U.S. will not maintain permanent bases there. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the request this week.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Bush administration&#146;s failure to plan for the military occupation of Iraq has led to disaster,&#148; said Win Without War National Director and former Congressman Tom Andrews. &#147;More than one hundred thousand Iraqis and more than fifteen hundred American soldiers are dead.  Malnutrition among Iraqi children has doubled since the U.S. invasion and childhood mortality has tripled. The failure of the administration to establish a plan for the withdrawal of U.S. forces &#150; and declare that the U.S. will not maintain permanent military bases in Iraq &#150; continues to fuel insurgent claims that the U.S. intends to be a permanent military occupying power in Iraq.  As independent analysts have observed, we are creating insurgents faster than our Army is able to kill them. It is time for a fundamental change in U.S. policy before another penny is appropriated.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT">                        </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The U.S. Congress has an obligation to do what it should have done years ago &#150; hold the Bush administration accountable. It can begin by insisting that the administration establish a clear military exit strategy from Iraq and declare that it will not construct and maintain permanent military bases there,&#148; Andrews said.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Recent polls show that nearly 60% of Americans believe that the president does not have a clear exit strategy from Iraq and a huge 69% - including 62% of Republicans&#150; think it important that Bush administration have such a plan,&#148; said Win Without War Co-Chair Susan Shaer, Executive Director of Women&#146;s Action for New Directions, &#147;Any additional spending must be conditioned on meeting what a majority of Americans, and a large majority of Iraqis, believe is the right thing to do in Iraq.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign to pressure the Senate on the Bush administration&#146;s appropriation request for Iraq has been organized by Win Without War member organizations across the nation including MoveOn.org, True Majority, Working Assets and Women&#146;s Action for New Directions.
