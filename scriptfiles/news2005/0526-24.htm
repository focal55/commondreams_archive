<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- A new study of the government's anti- marijuana commercials shows that the ads create as many negative 
thoughts and impressions as positive ones, casting doubt on White 
House claims that the ads have reduced teen drug use. The new research 
will be presented by Dr. Harvey Ginsburg of Texas State University, 
San Marcos, as a "hot topics" talk at the American Psychological 
Society's annual convention in Los Angeles on May 28.

  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Groups of students, ages 18-23, were shown either four anti- tobacco TV commercials produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or four anti-marijuana ads produced by the White House 
Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Volunteers wrote down 
their reactions to each, and responses were then coded by independent 
reviewers (who did not know which ads had been viewed) as favorable 
to the ads' intent (e.g. characters giving warnings were viewed 
positively; themes were seen as realistic), unfavorable, or other.

     </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The combined responses to the anti-tobacco ads were strongly 
favorable, with overwhelmingly favorable responses to three out of 
four commercials. In contrast, the marijuana ads produced as many 
unfavorable responses as favorable ones. Only one of the four anti- marijuana commercials produced significantly more responses that were 
desirable (from the producers' point of view) than undesirable.

   </font><p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These findings are roughly consistent with independent 
evaluations showing that the anti-marijuana ads failed to produce 
positive impacts and may actually boomerang," Dr. Ginsburg said. "Any 
White House conclusions that their ads have caused a national 
reduction in marijuana use are not warranted."

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The final independent evaluation of the ONDCP ads, conducted by 
the University of Pennsylvania and originally scheduled for release 
in January, has been delayed without explanation.

     </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ginsburg's presentation is at 11:45 a.m. on Saturday, May 28, at 
the Westin Century Plaza Hotel, Malibu Room, 2025 Avenue of the Stars, 
in Los Angeles. For information, see
