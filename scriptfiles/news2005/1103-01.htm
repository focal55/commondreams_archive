<p>WASHINGTON - November 3 - Representative Greg Walden (R-OR) introduced a logging bill today that would disregard important protections for clean drinking water and wildlife, and eliminate meaningful environmental analysis and public involvement required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  This legislation is a gross example of misplaced priorities. We should be protecting homes and communities at risk from fires, not diverting scarce resources to damaging logging activities.

<p>After natural disturbances such as fires, nature knows best about how forests should recover. Science shows that what may seem like "common sense" activities, such as logging and replanting trees, actually hurts forests, water, and wildlife by lessening their ability to recover naturally and increasing the risk of future wildfires. 

<p>Scientific research has shown that logging dead or dying trees damages streams, increases fire risk, destroys wildlife habitat and wastes taxpayer dollars. It may seem counter intuitive, but science has also shown that burnt forests are going to be the old growth forests of tomorrow. 

<p>Congress has given the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management all of the authority it needs to address natural disasters and the Administration has granted itself several waivers from environmental analysis under NEPA to complete legitimate forest rehabilitation and recovery after natural events.  In fact, the forest clean-up from Hurricane Katrina -- of one of the greatest natural disasters in US history -- is being managed entirely within the confines of current forest management laws.  

<p>Lawmakers should be aware that the bill goes far beyond the provisions and reasoning for the Healthy Forests Restoration Act.  There is no ecological emergency to log after natural disturbances on America's forests, which is what this legislation recommends.  

<p>A stronger scientific and collaborative approach to maintaining the health of our national forests after natural disturbances can be found in Representative Tom Udall’s HR 3973, National Forests Rehabilitation and Recovery Act of 2005.  This legislation would allow local stakeholders to join together and create sensible long term restoration plans that protect communities from future wildfires, restore fish and wildlife habitat, and safeguard old growth and roadless forests from logging.
