<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 15 -- Yesterday, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Richard A. Kramer ruled that California's ban on marriage rights for same-sex couples was unconstitutional. In his ruling, Judge Kramer wrote that, despite attempts to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, &quot;the state's protracted denial of equal protection cannot be justified simply because such constitutional violation has become traditional.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are delighted to hear this news from California,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy. &quot;As the fight for equal marriage continues, decisions like this will be the stepping stones to victory.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just last month, same-sex couples celebrated when a state trial court ruled in a strongly-worded opinion that they have the right to marry in New York City. Judge Doris Ling-Cohan ruled that the New York State Constitution guarantees basic freedoms to lesbian and gay people, and emphasized marriage as a fundamental right of each person in the United States. Ling-Cohan will be a featured speaker at NOW Foundation's upcoming <a href="http://www.nowfoundation.org/issues/diverse/woca2005/" target="_new">Women of Color and Allies Summit</a>. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Finally, people are beginning to understand that marriage rights are everyone's rights&#151;not just those of heterosexual couples,&quot; said NOW Action Vice President Olga Vives. &quot;NOW will be there every step of the way to support and advocate for same-sex couples and their families.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW supports marriage rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and strongly opposes any effort to write discrimination into the U.S. Constitution. Allowing same-sex couples to marry expands and ensures the civil liberties of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, while demonstrating a commitment to fairness and justice for all people. As an organization committed to civil rights, NOW works to help create a more equitable and just society so that all individuals are treated with dignity and equality under the law.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
