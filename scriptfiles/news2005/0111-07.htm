<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- January 11 --  U.S. government sources announced today that the U.S. will release four British detainees and one Australian from Guant&aacute;namo where they have been held without charge for nearly three years.  The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) welcomed the action but reiterated their demand for legitimate legal hearings for all the detainees.   The Center for Constitutional Rights, for years the first and only legal organization willing to represent detainees against the unlawful detentions at Guant&aacute;namo, brought the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that detainees have the right to challenge their detentions in a court of law.  Despite the 2003 ruling, the Bush Administration has consistently failed to comply and has instead created sham tribunals and commissions, which have resulted in delaying all further legal proceedings. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said CCR President Michael Ratner, &quot;These men and others have lost years of their lives under the most dire of circumstances. Let it never happen again that people can be detained without trial, treated inhumanely and even tortured. Let this be a lesson to never deviate from the fundamental protection of human rights. This lesson must now be applied to all detainees remaining in U.S. detention facilities, whether in Guant&aacute;namo, Afghanistan, Iraq or around the world. We want a world without Guant&aacute;namos.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said CCR Deputy Legal Director Barbara Olshansky, &#147;The men scheduled for release are from countries which are political allies. Despite diplomatic legal and civil protests, they were held for nearly three years and are now being released without charge.  Hundreds more remain, with no legal recourse or access. Given the reports of abuse from our clients and all the documents coming to light on the torture practices of this Administration, we demand a full and independent investigation into the treatment of all the detainees.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR Attorney Rachel Meeropol said, &quot;Two of the detainees [Mamdou Habib and Feroz Abbasi] to be released were due to be charged before the sham military commissions that have been denounced by military attorneys as unlawful.  The commissions are another example of the Executive branch grabbing authority beyond the law and flouting the system of checks and balances and the separation of powers our country was founded on.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four remaining British detainees are Feroz Abbasi, Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg, and the Australian is Mamdou Habib, currently represented by Joe Margulies, who was a CCR Cooperating Attorney on the original Supreme Court case, Rasul v. Bush.  Two permanent British residents, Bisher al-Rawi and Jamil el-Banna, remain at Guant&aacute;namo.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
