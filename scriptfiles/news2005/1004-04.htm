<p>NEW YORK - The National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC) has scheduled a press conference at 10:30 am on Friday, October 7, at 239 Thompson St. (Judson Memorial
Church) in Manhattan to announce plans to escalate opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the nonpayment of taxes to the IRS.

<p>Some of the speakers have either gone to prison or are about to be jailed rather than violate their conscience by paying taxes that would contribute to killing. Among those speaking at the press conference will be Karl Meyer (Chicago, IL), Susan Quinlan (Berkeley, CA), Lee Gough (Brooklyn, NY), Joe Donato (Mays Landing, NJ), and Daniel Woodham (Greensboro, NC).

<p>The press conference is on the eve of a national strategy conference, being held in Brooklyn this coming weekend. Participants will develop creative ways to spread the refusal of taxes for war, including the rerouting of their taxes to community and other nongovernmental organizations rather than to the IRS.

<p>NWTRCC is a coalition of groups from across the U.S., formed in 1982 to provide information and support to people involved in or considering some form of refusal to pay taxes for war and the military.

<p>WHAT: News conference

<p>WHO: Peace activists refusing to pay taxes for the war

<p>WHEN: Friday, Oct. 7, 10:30 am

<p>WHERE: Judson Memorial Church,  239 Thompson St. (south of Washington Square Park between W. 3rd St. and Washington Sq. S.), Manhattan
