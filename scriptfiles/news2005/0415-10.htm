Socially-oriented systems that take into consideration not only the interests of the larger society but also of the generations to come are gradually coming into focus. Much of this could be attributed to the work of one man, Judge Christopher Weeramantry, a judge and former vice president of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, also known as the World Court.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judge Weeramantry has covered an extraordinary range of issues during his remarkable career. Many of his judgments introduced a new dimension to international law, such as the World Court's advisory opinion on the Illegality of Nuclear Arms, where he declared that the use of nuclear weapons is illegal under any circumstances whatsoever.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weeramantry is also widely respected for having introduced a multi-cultural approach based on the wisdom of the ancients and of various Third World nations.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information contact:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Janis D.
