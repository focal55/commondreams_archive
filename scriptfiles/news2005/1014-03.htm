<p>WASHINGTON - <p>   -- Mass. National Guard &amp; other Military Families Hold Press  Conference following meeting with Governor Romney, Urge him to  Support Troops by Calling for their Return from Iraq</p>
<p>   -- Military Families Hold Press Conference at Mass. State  House, Oct. 17 at 10:30 a.m.</p>

<p>   On Monday, Oct. 17 at 9:30 a.m. Mass. National Guard and other  military families from Massachusetts, who are all members of  Military Families Speak Out, will meet with Gov. Mitt Romney and  call on him to honor and support their loved ones and all the  troops by speaking out to bring them home now from Iraq, and to  take care of them when they return.</p>
<p>   Gov. Romney testified on Tuesday, October 11 in favor of his  bill to support the Massachusetts National Guard by increasing  death benefits received by their families. Concerned that the  Mass. National Guard is reaching only 70 percent of their  recruiting goals, the Governor stated, &quot;We're going to have to  revisit what our support is for those who ...wear the  servicemen's uniform...We're going to have to improve our side of  the bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>   Military Families Speak Out members, including Mass. National  Guard families, will remind Governor Romney that it was never  part of the &quot;bargain&quot; for soldiers to be sent off to fight a war  based on lies.</p>
<p>   WHAT: Press Conference with Mass. National Guard and other  Massachusetts military families</p>
<p>   WHERE: Grand Staircase, Massachusetts State House, Beacon St.  at Park St., Boston, Mass. </p>

<p>   WHEN: 10:30 a.m. Monday, Oct. 17 </p>
<p>WHO: Rose Gonzalez of Somerville whose mother is a member of the  Mass. National Guard serving in Iraq; Anne Sapp of Billerica  whose husband is a member of the Mass. National Guard and on his  way home from Iraq; Nina Douglas of Jamaica Plain whose stepson  is a Marine serving his second tour of duty in Iraq; Kevin Lucey  of Belchertown whose son Cpl. Jeffrey Lucey, a Marine Reservist,  served in Iraq in 2003, suffered from Post Traumatic Stress  Disorder and took his own life on June 22, 2004; Carlos and  Melida Arredondo of Roslindale, father and stepmother of Lance  Cpl. Alexander Arredondo who served with the Marines in Iraq and  was killed in action on Aug. 25, 2004; and Nancy Lessin and  Charley Richardson, co-founders of Military Families Speak Out  and parents of a Marine who served in Iraq in 2003 and is now in  the Individual Ready Reserves, eligible for re-deployment.</p>
<p>   Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) began in November, 2002  with two military families speaking out to prevent a U.S.  invasion of Iraq. The membership of MFSO now includes over 2,600  military families speaking out to support the troops, bring them  home now, take care of them when they get here, and prevent  troops from ever again being sent to an unjustifiable war.</p>
