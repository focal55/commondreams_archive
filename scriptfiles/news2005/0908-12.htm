<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 8 - In a letter to the five major news networks (ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX, and NBC), U.S. Senator Russ Feingold today asked each of them to provide airtime to the survivors of Hurricane Katrina who are spread out across the country in relief staging areas.

 

<p>“Like all Americans, my thoughts are with those struggling to cope with the terrible effects of Hurricane Katrina. The devastation brought by the storm is absolutely heart-wrenching and beyond description,” Feingold's letter read.  “As your news coverage has shown, one of the many struggles that the survivors of Hurricane Katrina face today is their separation from family and loved ones.”

 

<p>In the letter, Feingold said that while there have been many success stories of families being brought back together by the news media and others after being displaced by the hurricane, many survivors “still carry the heavy burden of not knowing the whereabouts of loved ones, especially loved ones.”

 

<p>While there have been efforts by reporters, through the internet, to connect Hurricane survivors “the effort to bring families back together might be well served by having the news networks dedicate a substantial block of air-time...  so that those survivors who are in search of loved ones could both let their voice be heard and tune in to a particular network at a specific time to connect with family members through telephone hotlines at the various staging areas.”

 

<p>“Using the power of our television airwaves could go a long way in helping to bring families back together after this tragedy.  It would also ease the enormous anxiety and pain many must feel not knowing the condition of their loved ones,” Feingold said. “This could do a great deal to restore hope to those who have lost so much in this national tragedy.”

<p>Like all Americans, my thoughts are with those struggling to cope with the terrible effects of Hurricane Katrina. The devastation brought by the storm is absolutely heart-wrenching and beyond description. 

 

<p>As your news coverage has shown in very real terms one of the many struggles that the survivors of Hurricane Katrina face today is their separation from family and loved ones.

 

<p>While there have been many success stories of families being brought back together after the hurricane thanks to the help of the news media and others, many survivors still carry the heavy burden of not knowing the whereabouts of loved ones, especially children.

 

<p>I am writing to ask that you consider providing air-time to help survivors spread out across the country in relief staging areas make contact with their loved ones. I understand that some of your reporters have used their coverage to help survivors find love ones and I applaud those efforts. I also understand that the internet is being used to both register people displaced by the hurricane and bring them together with loved ones, but these efforts to reunite families might be further helped by having the news networks dedicate a substantial block of air-time to assist survivors.  One possibility, for example, would be for each network to devote two hours of primetime to broadcasting appeals from survivors in search of loved ones, so that those survivors could both broadcast their appeals to a wide audience and tune in to a particular network at a specific time to connect with family members through telephone hotlines at the various staging areas.

 

<p>Using the power of our television airwaves could go a long way in helping to bring families back together after this tragedy and ease the enormous anxiety and pain they must feel not knowing the condition of their loved ones.  Such a step would also be consistent with your responsibilities as custodians of the public airwaves.

 

<p>It is my hope that you will seriously consider making this contribution to an effort that could do a great deal to restore hope to those who have lost so much in this national tragedy.

 

<p>Sincerely,

 

 

 

<p>Russ Feingold<br>
United States Senator
