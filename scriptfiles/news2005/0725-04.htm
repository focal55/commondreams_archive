<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON - July 23 - Following the death of Jean Charles de Menezes on Friday 22nd July Lambeth Stop the War Coalition have called a Peace and Solidarity Vigil at Stockwell tube station at 6pm tonight, Monday 25th July. Bring Flowers. Join in our Peace Vigil, Unite for Peace, Unite Against Racism and campaign to Bring our Troops Home. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A TRAGIC MISTAKE   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday a man was walking from his home to Stockwell tube. Police in plain clothes followed him and just before he entered the underground station they shouted at him. Scared, he ran into the station with the police following him. They caught him, held him down and shot him in the head five times. He had nothing to do with the London bombing campaign. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He was unlucky enough to be wearing the wrong clothes and his skin was the wrong colour. Subsequently it has been revealed that the police have been operating a secret shoot-to-kill policy. Armed officers have been undergoing training with the Israeli defence forces. This is the result. Police now regret this 'tragic mistake'. The real tragic mistake has been the illegal, immoral and barbaric invasion of Iraq. The killing of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Londoners are now really paying the price of this war, both in the suicide bombings and in this public killing. We send our heartfelt condolences to this man's family.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
