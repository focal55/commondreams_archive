<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FORT WORTH, TX -- January 5 -- In an effort to raise funds to aid the victims of the Asian tsunamis, the Fort Worth Zoo's (Texas) Asian elephant painted an original work of art, which is being auctioned off on E-Bay beginning at noon on January 5. 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the painting will be donated to the American Red Cross International Response Fund. The painting is for sale from January 5 to January 12, and the minimum bid is $500.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 24&quot; x 48&quot; piece of modern art is characterized by its sweeping motions and few straight lines, and of course, is made unique by its artist-a 7,000 pound Asian elephant at the Fort Worth Zoo.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born in Thailand in 1967, Rasha, the Fort Worth Zoo's &quot;Painting Pachyderm,&quot; began her painting career in the summer of 1996. To encourage the development of her talent, animal keepers have incorporated 15- to 30-minute painting sessions into her management. During the painting sessions, which often follow her morning bath, keepers hand her a paintbrush and offer her aesthetically pleasing color schemes. &quot;Pachyderm painting&quot; and other forms of enrichment are conducted at the Fort Worth Zoo to enhance natural behaviors and provide a healthy and stimulating environment for the animals.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Fort Worth Zoo houses 380 Asian animals and supports more than 25 conservation projects in countries throughout Asia,&quot; Director of Conservation and Science Tarren Wagener said. &quot;It seems fitting that as the Zoo continues to educate a million people annually on the importance of Asian animal species, that the Zoo also makes an effort to support the people of Asia during this crisis.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information on the Fort Worth Zoo, visit <a href="http://www.fortworthzoo.org/" target="_new">http://www.fortworthzoo.org</a>.
