<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 11 - As Congress prepares to debate the USA PATRIOT Act and the future of the Supreme Court, a new report documents the erosion of the judiciary's power to protect Constitutional liberties since September 11.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report -- Courting Danger: How the War on Terror Has Sapped the Power of our Courts to Protect our Constitutional Liberties -- was released today by the Justice at Stake Campaign, a nonpartisan national partnership of more than 40 organizations working to keep courts fair, impartial and independent. The report can be downloaded from Justice at Stake's Web site.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Courting Danger shows how ten sections of the PATRIOT Act, along with other recent policies, have granted the federal government more powers to investigate and incarcerate without meaningful review from a judge. Numerous provisions of the PATRIOT are set to expire this year unless they are reauthorized by Congress.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In some cases, our judges' gavels have been replaced with rubber stamps,&quot; said Bert Brandenburg, Executive Director of Justice at Stake. &quot;In many cases, the government can now skip the courthouse altogether.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to analyzing the PATRIOT Act, the report:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Reviews its sequel, &quot;Patriot II,&quot; which the Justice Department initially disavowed but parts of which have reappeared in current proposals. In June a Senate panel approved a bill, S. 1266, parts of which would extend the reach of the government even further than Patriot II.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Shows how, since September 11, courts have been losing their powers to guarantee refugees and immigrants procedures that are fair and treatment that is decent.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Shows how America's courts, since September 11 and for more than two centuries, have routinely given the President and Congress considerable deference during times of war.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Provides context by showing how for more than a decade, an increasingly aggressive band of lawmakers and special interest groups have been working to weaken the power of our courts and the legitimacy of our judges.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also provides information on more than 20 government agencies and organizations on all sides of the debate over how to balance liberty and security in post 9/11 America. </font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
