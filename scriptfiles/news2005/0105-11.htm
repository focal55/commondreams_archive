<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 5 -- Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) today called on Attorney General nominee Alberto Gonzales to publicly support the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry, wholly separate from the Department of Justice, to investigate all aspects of the United States' detention and interrogation policies and practices. Such a commission should consist of credible independent experts, have international expert input, and have subpoena powers and access to all levels of government, all agencies, and all documents whether classified or unclassified.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senior administration officials, including Gonzales, participated in the formulation of US policy on the treatment of prisoners that set aside key protections against torture and, in specific cases, authorized the use of techniques that constitute torture. To date, none of these officials has been held accountable for these decisions and their consequences.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International takes no position on the appointment of individual nominees, however the organization believes that as nominee for Attorney General, the role of Gonzales in developing US policy on torture deserves close and careful scrutiny.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As White House Counsel, Mr. Gonzales was a key participant in setting US policy on torture. Nominated to be the nation's top law-enforcement official, he must acknowledge not only the need to ensure that those individuals who authorized or inflicted torture are held criminally liable, but also the need to recuse himself from any role in that investigation,&quot; said Dr. William F. Schulz, Executive Director of AIUSA. &quot;Pronouncements of his opposition to torture will ring hollow if not accompanied by a commitment to ensure that no one escapes accountability for ordering or approving the infliction of torture. As nominee for Attorney General, he ought to be ready to assure the American people and the world that he supports the prosecution of those who sanctioned torture and ill-treatment, regardless of rank or office.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
