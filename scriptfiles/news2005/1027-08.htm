<p>WASHINGTON - If Congressman Richard Pombo and House Republicans
have their way, well over 5 million acres of mining claims across the West
will be up for sale, in what could become one of the largest land giveaways
in U.S. history. Mining and other development on these lands would threaten 
hundreds of America&#8217;s most treasured natural places. 
&nbsp; 
<p>Mining claims currently can be staked on as many as 270 million acres of 
public land in the 13 western states. Until 1994, when the Clinton 
administration put a halt on new land purchases, companies that struck gold 
or other metals on their claims could simply buy that land at prices set by 
the Congress in 1872, and make millions on what was previously public 
property. 
&nbsp; 
<p>Today the House Resources Committee passed a proposal by Chairman Richard 
Pombo to overturn the Clinton ban on purchasing these mining lands and put 
5.7 million acres of public lands up for sale in 13 western states. 
&nbsp; 
<p>&#8220;Chairman Pombo wants to sell the American West to foreign mining 
corporations, and anyone else who can pay a fraction of market value for the 
land,&#8221; said Dusty Horwitt, analyst for Environmental Working Group (EWG). 
&#8220;If Pombo&#8217;s bill passes, America&#8217;s treasured natural heritage will be for 
sale to anyone who wants to buy it.&#8221; 
&nbsp; 
<p>EWG&#8217;s interactive maps of corporate hold over public lands, available at 
<a href="http://www.ewg.org/mining/claims/index.php/">http://www.ewg.org/mining/claims/index.php/</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/losingground/,">http://www.ewg.org/reports/losingground/,</a> show that 5.7 million acres of 
taxpayer lands could be sold immediately if Pombo&#8217;s plan succeeds. 
&nbsp; 
<p>The following is a state-by-state summary of the currently claimed acres 
that could be privatized upon passage of Pombo&#8217;s legislation (figures are 
current as of 2004): 
&nbsp; 
<p>* Alaska: at least 196,408 acres. 
&nbsp; 
<p>* Arizona: 641,883 acres, including 10 claims within five miles of Grand 
Canyon National Park and nine claims within five miles of Saguaro National 
Park.  
&nbsp;

Joshua Tree National Park. 
&nbsp; 
<p>* Colorado: 123,457 acres, including one claim within five miles of Rocky 
Mountain National Park and eight claims within five miles of Black Canyon of 
the Gunnison National Park.

&nbsp; 
<p>* Montana: 245,869 acres, including 20 claims within five miles of
