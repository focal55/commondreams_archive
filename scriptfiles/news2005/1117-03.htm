<p>WASHINGTON - November 17 - Do you have ideas for strengthening the U.S. economy and improving the daily lives of working men and women and their families?  If so, there’s a web site you need to visit right away.  On www.SinceSlicedBread.com, people from all across the country are submitting their ideas for ways to improve health care and education, make our tax system more equitable, and ensure good jobs.  The person who has the best idea will win $100,000 and a commitment from the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) to work to make that idea a reality.
 
<p>“It seems like Congress gets further and further away from meeting the needs of real Americans every single day,” said SEIU President Andy Stern.  “The world is changing rapidly and our old ways of doing things aren’t working.  We’re asking Americans to tell us what needs to be done to help the U.S. compete in the global economy and make work pay and we’re hearing from them!  So far, we have more than 9,000 ideas on the web site.  And now Congress needs to take the time to listen to what they’re saying, too.”
 
<p>Ideas should be no more than 175 words and the deadline for submitting them is midnight on December 5.   Ideas may be submitted through the web site or by mail to: 
 
<p><a href="http://www.SinceSlicedBread.com">SinceSlicedBread.com</a><br>
1220 L Street, NW, Suite 100-320
<br>
Washington, DC  20005-4018
 
<p>In addition to the grand prize, two runners-up will receive prizes of $50,000 each.  Judges for the contest include leading economists, thinkers, businesspeople, labor leaders, activists and Wall Street investors, among them such notable names as Ed Rollins and Carol Browner.   The judges will select 21 finalists, whose ideas will be published in a book in February.  In January, the public will be invited to vote on those ideas to select the top three. Contest rules and information and a list of the judges are posted at www.SinceSlicedBread.com. 
 
<p>The conversation on www.SinceSlicedBread.com is lively and interesting.  To date, people from every state in the nation have submitted more than 9,500 ideas, addressing everything from the costs of housing and health care to job training and outsourcing to the internet and taxes.  Visitors to the site are invited to review and comment on the ideas posted and a special blog section features commentary by nationally-known bloggers.
