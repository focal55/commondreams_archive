<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WASHINGTON - September 15 - <font face="Times New Roman"></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Human Rights Campaign derided a new instruction to Catholic 
seminaries to look for &#8220;evidence of homosexuality&#8221; in 
seminarians and priests. According to a <i>New York Times</i> article, the 
instruction is tied to church officials&#8217; insistence that gay 
clergy are responsible for the sexual abuse scandal even in the face of 
scientific evidence to the contrary.</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The real debate 
around this witch hunt isn&#8217;t between us and the 
Vatican, it&#8217;s between the&#160;Vatican and the truth,&#8221; said HRC President Joe Solmonese. 
&#8220;When the church makes gay men a scapegoat for pedophiles, it 
ignores one problem and creates another. It does nothing to keep 
children safe or punish criminals.&#8221;&#8220;The church is not 
following its own teachings. Jesus told the truth in love,&#8221; said 
Harry Knox, M. Div., director of the HRC Religion and Faith Program. 
&#8220;This is contrary to Christ&#8217;s admonition to love our 
neighbors with the same care we give ourselves.&#8221;Several scientific studies show 
no tie between gays and pedophilia.&#160;&#160;</font></p>
