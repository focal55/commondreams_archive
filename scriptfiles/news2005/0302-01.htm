<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FINDLAND -- March 2 -- Greenpeace today announced that it would be stepping up its campaign to protect remaining ancient forests in Finland by establishing a Forest Rescue Station in the last S&aacute;mi reindeer forests of Arctic Lapland. This follows the Finnish government's decision to start new logging operations in important winter grazing pine forests, in defiance of urgent recommendations issued by the UN Human Rights Committee (1).</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Forest Rescue Station will act as a forward operating base from which to  monitor logging operations and assist the S&aacute;mi reindeer herding cooperatives in mapping and demarcating important areas of forests. Activists will be living in a combination of insulated modular containers and traditional S&aacute;mi tents.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the face of international human rights scrutiny, the Finnish government has chosen to take the business as usual approach,&quot; said Matti Liimatainen Greenpeace forest campaigner.  &quot;As long as the government continues to log the last S&aacute;mi reindeer forests, Greenpeace will be active in these areas until they recognise their importance and stop their destruction.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In northern Lapland, many S&aacute;mi indigenous peoples still practice traditional reindeer herding, relying on remaining old-growth forests to provide vital food for their reindeer during the cold winter months. The S&aacute;mi reindeer herders have been fighting alone for their livelihood and have been calling on the government to protect important areas of reindeer forests from industrial logging. The Finnish government has always prioritised other forms of land uses other than reindeer herding. The reindeer forests have been reduced piece by piece the government's own logging company, Mets&auml;hallitus, which carries out most of the logging in Lapland.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About 70 percent of the wood logged by Mets&auml;hallitus in S&aacute;mi areas is sold for pulp and paper production (2). The Finnish paper giant, StoraEnso buys most of the wood originating from destruction of reindeer grazing forests, which finally ends up being sold to the European consumer as magazines, copy paper, and envelopes.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sadly we are fast approaching the point of no return. Mets&auml;hallitus are on the verge of logging some of the last tracts of old-growth forest containing horsetail lichen, vital for winter grazing of reindeer,&quot; said Liimatainen . &quot;What's insane is that S&aacute;mi's reindeer herding livelihood is being pulped to make cheap magazines, copy paper, envelopes and even disposable tissue paper.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A coalition of reindeer herding cooperatives have recently sent a letter to the Minister of Forestry and Agriculture calling on the Finnish government to agree to a moratorium in the important reindeer forests that have been mapped (3).  Greenpeace and other Finnish environmental groups are supporting these demands and have written to the government urging them to take immediate action.<br>		<br> Greenpeace activist Ulvar Arnvaern helps unload sections of the Forest Rescue Station in the last remaining ancient forests of Finnish Lapland.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace activist Ulvar Arnvaern helps unload sections of the Forest Rescue Station in the last remaining ancient forests of Finnish Lapland.<br><br><i>Notes to Editor:</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>1. UN Human Rights Committee (November 2004):<br>&middot; &quot;?.regrets that it has not received a clear answer concerning the  rights of the S&aacute;mi as an indigenous people (Constitution, sect. 17, subsect. 3), in the light of article 1 of the Covenant. It reiterates its concern over the failure to settle the question of S&aacute;mi rights to land ownership and the various public and private uses of land that affect the S&aacute;mi 's traditional means of subsistence - in particular reindeer breeding - thus endangering their traditional culture and way of life, and hence their identity.&quot;<br>&middot; &quot;The State party should, in conjunction with the S&aacute;mi people, swiftly take decisive action to arrive at an appropriate solution to the land dispute with due regard for the need to preserve the S&aacute;mi identity in accordance with article 27 of the Covenant. Meanwhile it is requested to refrain from any action that might adversely prejudice settlement of the issue of S&aacute;mi land rights. &quot;</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Greenpeace tracked pulp logs from two of Mets&auml;hallitus's recent logging operations in northern Lapland to StoraEnso's pulp mill Kemij&auml;rvi: This mill supplies StoraEnso's Veitsiluoto paper mill, which manufactures envelopes, magazine and copy paper. Kemij&auml;rvi also exports pulp to European paper mills, including those that produce copy paper, magazines and disposable tissue paper.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The reindeer herding cooperatives from Inari and Nellim sub-group sent the letter to the Minister of Forestry and Agriculture on 16th January 2005.
