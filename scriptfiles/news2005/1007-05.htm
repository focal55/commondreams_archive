<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> WASHINGTON - In the wake of the human and economic tragedy caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Sierra Club staff, volunteers, and community members from the Gulf Coast are writing first-hand stories about events unfolding in the region.  Through personal narratives and photographs, "Notes from the Gulf Coast" highlights personal experiences, draws attention to stories that have not yet crossed the media line, and speak about the environmental disaster and the process of rebuilding Gulf communities.

<p>"Last Saturday night the DuPont DeLisle chemical plant was burning its trash, even though there was a burn ban on. Someone said they had a permit. But it was bad. The smoke was bad and the smell was worse," wrote Myra Marsh, a Sierra Club activist who lives near plant and once worked there in the early years where she became unable to walk after being exposed to so many toxics.

<p>Rose Johnson, co-chair of Sierra Club's Mississippi Chapter, tells of her frustration over trying to distribute $25,000 to Katrina victims in North Gulfport.  "We went outside to a table to write the checks, and then we were asked to leave the property. We went across the street to continue writing checks, and a sheriff deputy arrived and advised us that we could create a riot giving out money and food stamps."

<p>New stories are added frequently with timely and compelling personal accounts.  
<p>To assist you in covering the impacts and lessons of the tragedy of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Sierra Club is providing a list of relevant environmental and public health issues where the Sierra Club can offer expertise: <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/releases/pr2005-09-02.asp">http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/releases/pr2005-09-02.asp</a><!-- #EndEditable -->
