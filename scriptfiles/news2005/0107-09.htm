<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 7 -- Democratic leaders in Congress today called on President Bush to stop the alarming use of illegal covert propaganda to promote government policy after two new accounts of such activity surfaced today.  In a letter to the President, they pointed out that the use of covert propaganda has been revealed through independent investigations by at least three separate federal agencies.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are concerned that these three incidents, while serious and disturbing on their own, may not be isolated incidents,&quot; the lawmakers wrote to the President. &quot;It would be abhorrent to our system of government if these incidents were part of a deliberate pattern of behavior by your Administration to deceive the public and the media in an effort to further your policy objectives.&quot; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They called on the President to &quot;publicly renounce the use of covert propaganda to influence public opinion.  And we urge you to direct your department and agency heads to immediately disclose all past and on-going efforts to engage in covert propaganda, whether through contracts with commentators, the distribution of video news releases, or other means.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawmakers pointed out that &quot;covert propaganda to influence public opinion is unethical and dangerous.  It violates fundamental principles of open government.  And it is illegal.&quot; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was signed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), the senior Democrat on the Government Reform Committee, Rep. George Miller (D-CA), the senior Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, Rep. David Obey (D-WI), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the outgoing Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Senior Democrat on the Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources Subcommittee.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was in reaction to two reports today.  USA Today disclosed that the Department of Education paid $240,000 to conservative political commentator Armstrong Williams to routinely promote the No Child Left Behind Act on his broadcast shows without revealing that he was being paid by the government to do so.  Rep. Miller separately today requested that the Department's Inspector General investigate this contract with Williams.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And the Washington Post and New York Times reported today on a General Accounting Office report to Rep. Waxman and Rep. Obey that found the Office of Drug Control Policy violated the law when it used video news releases to promote an anti-marijuana message without revealing to television news viewers that the on-camera &quot;reporter&quot; was really an actor, not a journalist.  In May, the GAO found that the Department of Health and Services also violated the law by producing and distributing similar video news releases regarding Medicare policy.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The text of the letter follows.</font></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">January 7, 2005</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The White House<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, DC 20500</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. President:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            We are writing about the Administration's use of taxpayer dollars to influence public opinion.  Recent investigations have revealed at least three separate instances in which the Administration has used covert propaganda to shape public perceptions.      </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Today, USA Today reported that &quot;[s]eeking to build support among black families for its education reform law, the Bush administration paid a prominent black pundit $240,000 to promote the law on his nationally syndicated television show and to urge other black journalists to do the same.&quot;  According to the article, the Department of Education paid Armstrong Williams, a conservative political commentator, to promote the No Child Left Behind Act during his broadcast television and radio shows and to encourage other prominent black journalists to take similar actions.[1]  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that video news releases concerning the dangers of marijuana, involving actors pretending to be reporters and distributed by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, were illegal &quot;covert propaganda.&quot;[2]  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last May, GAO made a similar finding regarding video news releases that also involved fake reporters and were distributed by the Department of Health and Human Services in support of the Medicare Modernization Act.[3]</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Covert propaganda to influence public opinion is unethical and dangerous.  It violates fundamental principles of open government and it distorts the free press and the public's right to know.  And it is illegal.  GAO found that both sets of video news releases violated prohibitions against publicity and propaganda because they did not identify the federal government as the source of the fabricated news reports.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            We are concerned that these three incidents, while serious and disturbing on their own, may not be isolated incidents but rather a deliberate pattern of behavior by your Administration to deceive the public and the media in an effort to further your policy objectives.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We ask you to publicly renounce the use of covert propaganda to influence public opinion.  And in furtherance of official congressional oversight, we request that you direct all department and agency heads to immediately provide to us all past and ongoing efforts to engage in covert propaganda, whether through contracts with commentators, the distribution of video news releases, or other means. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep.
