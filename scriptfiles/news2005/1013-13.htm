</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - Common Cause on Thursday urged the Senate Ethics Committee to consider new information regarding Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) holding HCA, Inc. stock in an investment partnership, in addition to the HCA stock held in his other blind trusts.&#160; Today&#8217;s letter was prompted by recent disclosures by the Associated Press that between 1998 and 2002 Senator Frist held HCA stock in an investment partnership that was placed in a Tennessee blind trust separate from those governed by Senate ethics rules.&#160; The Tennessee trust allowed the senator or his brother to be informed of transactions and to influence decisions involving the stock, thus failing to &#8220;insulate him from a conflict of interest.&#8221;</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>&#8220;It seems apparent from these recently published reports that Sen. Frist faced a genuine conflict of interest long before his recent sale of HCA stock,&#8221; Common Cause President Chellie Pingree wrote in a letter sent today to the Ethics Committee.&#160;</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s letter, Common Cause again called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate whether Senator Frist violated Senate ethics rules by directing trustees to sell stock held in a blind trust.&#160; Additionally, Common Cause asked the Committee to clarify how the reported numerous communications between Sen. Frist and trustees of his blind trust, during a period when he was working on legislation of interest to HCA, did not qualify as a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>The letter specifically asks the Ethics Committee to launch inquiries into Senator Frist&#8217;s handling of HCA stock and the possible conflicts of interest it might have created,</p>

<p>and to inform Common Cause about its plans to proceed with an investigation.&#160; Additionally, Common Cause asked that should the Committee dismiss this request, that it &#8220;state publicly the Committee&#8217;s reasons for not investigating.&#8221;</p>
