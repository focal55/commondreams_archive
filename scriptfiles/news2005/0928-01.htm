<p>WASHINGTON - September 28 - In the wake of Katrina, environmentalists take a look at the future of the movement, and how the national debate can be transformed. The Moving Ideas Network released a report today, <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/environrpt.htm">"The Environment: Death & Rebirth"</a>, which links to articles in The American Prospect's October issue special report as well as links to reports, analysis, and commentary from experts in the field.

<p>"In addition to being a human and economic tragedy, Katrina is an environmental disaster of unprecedented proportions," says Carl Pope of the Sierra Club in his article.

<p>With global warming cited as a cause of the growing intensity of hurricanes, the report focuses on the environmental movement's response to global warming, with particular attention given to the controversial "The Death of Environmentalism" essay. Experts discuss ways the movement can be re-shaped and re-framed as an economic, national security issue that affects everyone's daily lives. "The Death of" authors close out the report with an update on their progress to help re-shape the movement. Political analysts also provide roadmaps for changing the political landscape on environmental and other progressive issues from recruiting and training progressive candidates to forming critical coalitions.

<p>"Although this report focuses on how environmentalists can transform the national debate, the value is more in its connection to how the progressive movement as a whole can unite to effect change," says Melanie Alston-Akers, Moving Ideas Network Director.

<p>The report also discusses reframing the population control debate to one of sustainable development, how cities are addressing the urban asthma epidemic, and environmental strides being made on the state and local level.
