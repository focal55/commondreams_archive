<p>WASHINGTON - November 14 - “In his latest media blitz, the President is still failing to provide a plan to get our nation’s national security policy on track.  During his recent Veteran’s Day speech, he used the same tired rhetoric that the American people have already made clear they don’t buy.  Instead of coming clean with the American people and putting forth a strategy to finish the military mission in Iraq, the White House has decided to attack those who question their rhetoric.  This ever increasing and disturbing cycle of trying to defend an Iraq policy that was flawed from the very beginning has to end.  

 

<p>On Tuesday, the Senate has an opportunity, and an important responsibility, to force the President to do the job he has abdicated for far too long.

 

<p>I have worked with leading Democratic members of the Senate in drafting an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill that in part forces the President to report to Congress with a flexible timetable to finish the military mission in Iraq and bring American troops home.  The Senate is poised to debate and vote on our amendment over the next two days.  It is a very modest proposal, but it is a good first step in getting our Iraq and national security policies focused and on track.

 

<p>More and more elected officials are joining with a majority of Americans in demanding a sound Iraq policy – one that isn’t based on “stay the course” sound bites.  The President needs to understand that the time has come to put our Iraq policy straight.”

 

<p>Feingold voted against the Iraq resolution in October 2002.  In June, he introduced a resolution that called on the President to provide a flexible, public timetable for our mission in Iraq – one that is tied to clear and achievable benchmarks.  In August, Feingold put forward December 31, 2006 to help jumpstart the discussion of a target date to complete the military mission there.
