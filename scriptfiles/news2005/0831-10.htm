<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 31 - Households in communities with few transportation 
options&#8212;most of them in sprawling metro areas in the South&#8212;are forced to send 
more of their gasoline dollars to Middle Eastern countries where an unknown 
amount of oil money flows to anti-American extremists. Amid record high gas 
prices and calls for energy independence, the analysis suggests the need to 
broaden transportation options for gridlocked commuters in order to decrease 
dependence on Middle Eastern oil sources and increase national security over the 
long haul.<BR><BR>The report by Environmental Working Group (EWG) features a 
first-of-its-kind analysis that combines U.S. data on driving and energy to show 
how much the average driver in the 50 largest metropolitan areas spent on Middle 
East oil at the pump. Drivers in highway-dependent southern metro areas that 
have grown rapidly during the past 30 years sent the most money per driver to 
Middle East oil producers. In areas with a commitment to rail and other transit 
systems, people send far less money to the Gulf in the form of gasoline 
dollars.<BR><BR>An average household in the New York metro area sends about $132 
a year to the Middle East for gasoline&#8212;less than half what average households 
spend in five southern cities: Nashville, Tennessee ($314); Jacksonville, 
Florida ($302); Charlotte, North Carolina ($301); Dallas, Texas ($299); and 
Atlanta, Georgia ($289). The full list is available online at <A 
href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/stuckinthesand/.">http://www.ewg.org/reports/stuckinthesand/.</A><BR><BR>"Major 
shifts in transportation priorities are essential to achieving energy 
independence and maintaining national security," said Richard Wiles, Senior Vice 
President at EWG. "A serious commitment to rail and transit has been a missing 
element in the U.S. strategy to reduce our dependence on Middle East oil." 
Reports from town after town indicate that once trains or buses are a vital 
transportation option, commuters ride them in numbers that exceed planners' 
expectations.<BR><BR>Policy needs to change at the federal and state levels. For 
decades, federal transportation dollars have gone overwhelmingly to road 
projects. The recently passed transportation bill actually worsens the historic 
80/20 imbalance in federal highway and transit funding by shaving transit's 
share by a quarter of one percent, or about $700 million over the life of the 
bill. State transportation spending has also favored roads over transit. "We 
built the national highway system in the 1950s to protect us from Cold War 
threats," said Wiles. "But the world has changed and the threats to our security 
have changed. We need to change our transportation system to reflect 21st 
century security needs."<!-- #EndEditable -->
