<P>LONDON - November 10 - Amnesty International condemns in the strongest terms the three suicide attacks in Jordan which claimed the lives of at least 56 people, and injured 300 others, most of them civilians. 

<P>"Our thoughts and sympathy are first and foremost with those who have become the victims of this outrage in Jordan," said Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International. "Deliberately attacking civilians can never be justified. By committing such heinous attacks those responsible have demonstrated their utter disregard for the most fundamental principles of humanity." 

<P>Coordinated suicide attacks ripped through three hotels in the Jordanian capital Amman on Wednesday night, 10 November. A group affiliated to the Jordanian-born al-Qaida leader, Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, reportedly claimed responsibility.

<P>Amnesty International called for an immediate end to such attacks and for those responsible to be brought to justice in proceedings which meet international standards. It also reminded the Jordanian government that its security forces are obliged to respect human rights standards in their pursuit of the perpetrators.
