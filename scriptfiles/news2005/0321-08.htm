<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 21 -- Former Senator Timothy E. Wirth, President of the United Nations Foundation, issued the following statement regarding the release of &#147;In Larger Freedom: Towards Security, Development and Human Rights for All &#150; a report issued today by Secretary-General Kofi Annan:</font></p><p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called on global leaders to strengthen their collective ability to tackle the most critical security and social challenges.  Annan&#146;s report provides a unique opportunity for the United States to work with the UN and play a leadership role in addressing issues of terrorism, poverty, human rights and the environment.  At the same time, the report identifies steps that will help make the UN itself a more effective and efficient organization.  The serious challenges addressed by the Secretary-General&#146;s report cannot be met by any one nation acting alone.  As a global leader, the U.S. is well positioned to help the UN and the world community to address these fundamental challenges and make the world body a stronger organization.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The full report and supplemental information can be accessed at <a href="http://www.www.un.org/largerfreedom" target="_new">www.un.org/largerfreedom</a> </i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The UN Foundation was created in 1998 with businessman and philanthropist Ted Turner&#146;s historic $1 billion gift to support United Nations&#146; causes.
