<p>   BOSTON - Aid is getting through to  many of those affected by the earthquake, despite the massive  weather and logistical challenges, said Oxfam International  today. Four Oxfam aid flights are on their way from Britain to  the earthquake hit region. Trucks are on the roads and  distributions of tents, blankets and jerry cans are well underway  in many areas.</p>
<p>   Oxfam today announced that it has taken over an entire  tent-making factory in Lahore and is flying in another heavy lift  helicopter to help Oxfam get aid to the most remote areas. The  Mi- 8T Helicopter is on its way and should start flights in the  next few days. The helicopter can carry 4 tons of aid per flight,  twenty-two aid workers and at a speed of 250 kph is the fastest  possible way of getting aid to people in urgent need.</p>
<p>   Oxfam has bought up the whole production line of the tent  factory in Lahore to help supply 20,000 tents that Oxfam will  distribute. This factory will produce almost 100 tents per hour  and once made they will be distributed to those in need.</p>
<p>   Oxfam America President Raymond C. Offenheiser said that it  was very difficult to reach those in need:</p>
<p>   &quot;This isn't a logistical headache, it's a nightmare scenario.  Not only did the earthquake happen in an inaccessible and remote  area, it happened just before winter -- when snow cuts off huge  areas and temperatures plummet dangerously low,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>   &quot;We need to get thousands of heavy tents and blankets into  remote areas along roads that were barely passable even before  the earthquake -- and we need to do it quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>   Oxfam alone will need hundreds of truck journeys to get our  aid through and in some areas only helicopters will do the job.  We're flying in another helicopter to help. Winter tents and  blankets are in short supply so we are flying them in from around  the world and are taking over whole factories to help meet our  demand.</p>
<p>   Aid is now getting through but this is one of the most  challenging emergencies we have ever worked in,&quot; said  Offenheiser.</p>
<p>   Oxfam is flying aid out nonstop:</p>
<p>   -- An aid flight from the UK carrying 40 tons of relief items,  including water tanks and purification equipment is due to arrive  in Islamabad at 11 p.m. local time tonight</p>
<p>   -- A flight left from Sri Lanka yesterday carrying 14,000  Oxfam water buckets designed to keep water free from bacteria.</p>
<p>   -- A further flight carrying another 14,000 buckets is due to  leave from Sri Lanka today.</p>
<p>   -- A flight will leave over the weekend from Delhi with a  cargo of 30,000 blankets for Indian administered Kashmir.</p>
