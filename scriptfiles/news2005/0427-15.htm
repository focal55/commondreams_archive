<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 27 -- What: An unprecedented group of national security whistleblowers have formed a united front as the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (NSWBC). They will collectively attend two bipartisan congressional meetings today to demand that Congress act to end government retaliation against those who expose national security blunders, that Congress hold hearings into the federal governmenta's actions against whistleblowers, and that Congress act to require individual accountability for retaliation against whistleblowers. The congressional meetings will be followed by a press conference featuring speakers from the NSWBC and guest speakers.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers: Sibel Edmonds, Former Language Specialist, FBI</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coleen Rowley, Retired Agent and former division counsel, FBI</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Vincent, Veteran Special Agent, FBI</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mike German, Veteran Special Agent, FBI</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Russ Tice, Senior Intelligence Analyst &amp; Action Officer, NSA</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jesselyn Radack, Former Counsel, DOJ</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guest Speakers: Rep.

Today, the federal government's policies support and reinforce wrongdoers who would seek to silence whistleblowers by demoting them, taking away their security clearances, or firing them. In recent days that point was illustrated in the case of FBI Special Agent Robert Wright, who has been critical of the efforts to pursue terrorists. Without whistleblower protections, agencies will continue to quash truth tellers and national security weaknesses will be allowed to fester underneath the growing cloak of secrecy.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.
