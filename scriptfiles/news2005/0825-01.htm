<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 25 - The monitoring devices to detect leaks of deadly VX agent 
from the Bluegrass Army Depot were inoperative for many months, according to an 
affidavit from a chemical weapons monitoring operator released today by Public 
Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). PEER is asking for a Defense 
Department inspection of the Kentucky facility.
<P>Donald Van Winkle operates air-monitoring units designed to detect leaks of 
chemical warfare agents stored inside &#8220;igloos&#8221; at Bluegrass Army Depot. 
According to Van Winkle&#8217;s sworn statement, the monitors to detect VX agent, 
however, had been configured so as to be ineffective until very recently. In his 
affidavit, Van Winkle reveals that &#8211;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The supervisor of lab operations admitted in a meeting with more than a 
  dozen employees ordering the change in monitors to increase ease of access 
  even though it was known that the change would compromise leak detection; 
</LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Conversion pads in the monitors have an effective life of between ten and 
  thirty days but are often changed far less frequently; and </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Air monitoring equipment at the depot are at times so poorly maintained 
  that the units are not fit for operation. </LI></UL>
<P>VX is a highly lethal nerve agent. It is stored in the form of an 
amber-colored, oily liquid that is heavier than air and has low volatility 
unless temperatures are high. VX can be readily absorbed by inhalation, 
ingestion, and dermal contact. Persons whose clothing has been in contact with 
the nerve agent can contaminate their rescuers by direct contact or through 
release of vapor trapped by garments. </P>
<P>&#8220;A minuscule droplet of VX agent produces death in just minutes, so the 
consequences of an undetected VX leak could be devastating,&#8221; stated PEER General 
Counsel Richard Condit, whose organization is representing Van Winkle. &#8220;Of equal 
concern is that the culture at Bluegrass Army Depot tolerates lapses in 
monitoring protocol and discourages reports of problems.&#8221;</P>
<P>On August 3, 2005, Bluegrass Army Depot removed Van Winkle&#8217;s clearance to 
work in areas containing chemical agents &#8220;based upon allegations of suspect 
queries to crew members&#8221; that Van Winkle made concerning safety conditions.</P>
<P>&#8220;The operators of leak detection equipment at chemical weapons depots should 
be encouraged to ask questions about safety, but at Bluegrass silence is prized 
above all else,&#8221; Condit added.</P>
<P>PEER is requesting that the Defense Department Office of Inspector General 
determine the current efficacy of monitoring devices at Bluegrass Depot, review 
prior monitoring reports to determine their accuracy, interview the monitoring 
staff and look into the maintenance regimen for the leak detectors.</P>
