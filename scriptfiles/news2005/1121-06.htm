<p>SANTIAGO, Chile - November 21 - A recently opened  pulp mill in Chile has devastated one of South America's  most  biologically outstanding wetlands, decimating its famed  population of black-necked swans, along with most other bird  life, a WWF-led team of investigators said Monday.</p>
<p>   &quot;What was probably the largest population of black necked  swans in South America has been wiped out in less than a year. It  is an environmental catastrophe,&quot; said Clifton Curtis, director  of World Wildlife Fund's Global Toxic Program. &quot;Before the pulp  mill, there were more than 5,000 black necked swans in the Carlos  Anwandter Nature Sanctuary. When we visited the core of the  sanctuary in August, we could find only four.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary covers more than 12,000  acres of wetlands along the Cruces river in the southernmost  Chilean province of Valdivia. An officially designated &quot;wetland  of international importance&quot; under the Ramsar convention, it was  home to more than 100 species of rare, vulnerable or, in at least  two cases, endangered species of birds-the Coscoroba swan and the  white-faced Ibis. It was also the largest nesting area in South  America for the black necked swan, the region's iconic species  and a major tourist attraction.</p>
<p>   &quot;This was an area that was once teeming with water birds,&quot;  added David Tecklin, WWF's Valdivia ecoregion coordinator. &quot;Now,  within the space of just months, it has become an empty expanse  of brown, polluted water. It is a water desert. Words really  can't describe the magnitude of the disaster here.&quot;</p>
<p>   The investigators, who made two visits to the area, in August  and October, affirmed earlier findings by the Austral University  of Chile that pulp waste from the plant owned by CELCO, Chile's  largest timber conglomerate, is most likely responsible for the  catastrophic collapse of the swan population.</p>
<p>   The scientists concluded then that contaminants from the plant  contributed to a massive die off of luchecillo, the aquatic  vegetation that was the swans' main food source. </p>
<p>   &quot;It was heart-rending. We talked to people in Valdivia who  said they saw emaciated swans fall from  the sky, landing on rooftops and cars,&quot; Curtis said. &quot;They were  so weak they were unable to carry their own weight.&quot;</p>
<p>   Opened just upstream from the nature sanctuary in 2004, the  CELCO plant was twice temporarily shut down earlier this year for  environmental violations. Residents in Valdivia, 30 miles away,  complained of noxious odors from the plant and the WWF mission  found the facility's waste treatment, storage and disposal  safeguards to be appalling. &quot;Filter ashes, which can contain  dioxins, and other potentially toxic waste were simply being  dumped together in an open air site, where the wind can disperse  them,&quot; Tecklin said.</p>
<p>   The mission team, which prepared a report containing 25 key  findings and recommendations, is now urgently calling upon the  Chilean government and CELCO to take immediate remedial measures  to protect the sanctuary and develop a plan to end pollution from  the mill. Further research is also urgently needed to determine  the full impact of the pollution on both the environment and  human health.</p>
<p>   A growing citizen`s movement has kept case under the  spotlight, as never before for an environmental issue in Chile.  Although a series of lawsuits and other actions to force stronger  action against the company have not so far succeeded, the case is  now being heard by the Interamerican Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>   &quot;The sanctuary has suffered so much damage that we won't know,  without more research, how long it may take to restore it. The  first priority now should be strict measures to reduce pollution  at the source. At the same time, urgent human health and socio- economic impacts must be addressed. Thousands of families living  in this area are heavily dependent on tourism and on fishing  along the coast, where CELCO now plans to discharge liquid  waste,&quot; Tecklin added.</p>

<p>   EDITOR'S NOTES:</p>
<p>   The investigators' report, recommendations and photographs of  the sanctuary, taken both before and after the pulp mill opened,  are available at:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=57039&Link=http://www.worldwildlife.org/toxics/pubs.cfm">http://www.worldwildlife.org/toxics/pubs.cfm</a> </p>
<p>   In addition to Curtis and Tecklin, the WWF-led mission  included Delmar Blasco, former Secretary General of the Ramsar  Convention on Wetlands, and Rune Leithe-Eriksen, an expert on  pulp technologies and  Executive Director of Ecology and  Pioneering. Tecklin, in Santiago, and Curtis, in Washington,  D.C., are both available for interviews.</p>
