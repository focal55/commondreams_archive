<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GLENEAGLES / LONDON - July 7 - Leaders of the eight most powerful countries (G8) meeting here today agreed their final statement on climate change, but Friends of the Earth International said the document added nothing in the fight against climate change.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps G8 leaders will take to tackle climate change.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The environmental campaign group is disappointed that the G8 did not make more progress on climate change and sees the Bush administration as the main block to a stronger outcome.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth International Vice Chair Tony Juniper said:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration has again done its best to derail international action to tackle climate change, but this is by no means the end. There are many good initiatives happening in the USA to tackle climate change and it is only a matter of time before the President will have to follow suit&quot;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tony Blair now needs to tackle the issue with even more urgency during the UK Presidency of the European Union. He should also work to agree strong positions with other countries in the run up to the vital climate change talks in Canada this December.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tony Blair was right to prioritise climate change at the G8. Even if there was no progress here, there has been a big impact on public awareness and that will make it easier to achieve more in future talks&quot;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The G8 inaction on climate change flies in the face of the leaders of Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa (known as G5) who on July 7 stated that, as specified under the Kyoto Protocol, &quot;developed countries should therefore take the lead in international action to combat climate change by fully implementing their obligations of reducing emissions and of providing additional financing and the transfer of cleaner, low-emission and cost-effective technologies to developing countries.&quot;</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
