<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 6 -- On the same day that Steven Johnson, President Bush's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, testifies for the first time before the Senate, a new U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG) <a href="http://cleanairnow.org/cleanairnow.asp?id2=16639&id3=cleanairnow&" target="_new">report</a> finds that a loophole in the fine print of the Bush administration's &quot;Clear Skies&quot; (S.131) bill could exempt 39 percent of the nation's coal-fired power plant units from regulation, allowing them to emit toxic mercury indefinitely. Alexandria's Mirant Potomac River power plant, built in 1949, would be entirely exempt from reducing its mercury pollution under the bill. The plant emits 83.5 pounds of mercury into the air each year - the second highest of any plant in the U.S. that would be entirely exempt.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Very small amounts of mercury can go a long way,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Clean Air Advocate Supryia Ray. &quot;Scientists have found that just a single gram of mercury, about a drop, deposited over the course of a year was enough to contaminate the fish in a Wisconsin lake. This loophole is serious business for people who fish.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jonathon Krieger, a resident of Old Town Alexandria and an avid angler, stated, &quot;It's really difficult telling my two little boys that we can't eat the striped bass, largemouth bass, catfish, and other fish we catch because of mercury pollution. But the Mirant power plant will continue to contaminate the fish that my boys and I like to catch unless the government forces it and other facilities like it to clean up their act.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration has shown its willingness to go the extra mile in allowing polluters to continue despoiling the environment for profit,&quot; said Alexandria's Congressman Jim Moran. &quot;The Mirant Plant in Alexandria is the single largest source of toxic pollution in the D.C. region and would be one of the worst mercury offenders in the country if this law is passed. This provision would undo years of work and flies in the face of public support to clean up the Potomac and air quality in Northern Virginia.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill's mercury loophole, tucked into the definition of an &quot;affected unit,&quot; would exclude from regulation power plant units that emit 30 or fewer pounds of mercury per year. The loophole would include even units that are part of a multi-unit power </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
