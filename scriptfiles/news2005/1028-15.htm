<p>WASHINGTON – Cindy Sheehan is holding a week-long vigil which ends today in Lafayette Park to be a daily, visual reminder to those who live and work in the White House of the strong opposition to the Iraq war and the anger of the nation at the more than 2,000 US lives that have been lost in Iraq. Her protest was among more than 1,000 protests throughout the country that were held this week to honor the US soldiers whose lives were lost in Iraq and call for the troops to be brought home now.

<p>Sheehan will be in Lafayette Park holding her vigil today across from the White House until 6:30 PM when she departs to deliver flowers and a card to wounded Iraq soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital, 7200 Georgia Ave. NW at Elder at 7 PM.

<p>Statement from Cindy Sheehan on the Indictment and Resignation
of Lewis 'Scooter' Libby October 28, 2006:

<p>''While the indictment and resignation of Lewis 'Scooter' Libby is a
welcome development but, the responsibility for lying to the American
people and targeting critics and dissidents needs to go all the way
up the chain of command. Scooter Libby was clearly one of the
administration's attack dogs unleashed on opponents of this fraudulent
war, but he serves higher masters. This administration continues to
wage a war based on lies, a war that has taken the lives of 2,000
Americans, including my son, and the lives of tens of thousands of
innocent Iraqis. This indictment reinforces the growing calls in this
country and around the world to end the occupation, bring our troops
home and hold those responsible accountable for their crimes.
Let this serve as a springboard to put the war on trial and bring our
troops home now.''
