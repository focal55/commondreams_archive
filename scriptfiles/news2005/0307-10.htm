<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 7 -- Stephen Johnson, President Bush's newly nominated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator, will soon face his first big test in his new role.  Sometime between now and March 15, EPA is scheduled to finalize its proposed rule addressing mercury pollution from America's oldest and dirtiest power plants.  The rule itself would allow three times more mercury pollution from power plants for decades longer than strong enforcement of the current Clean Air Act allows.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By March 15, the public will know how independent Stephen Johnson will be of the Bush administration,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director.  &quot;He would earn a major vote of confidence and restore some much needed credibility to the EPA if he were to put forth a final mercury rule that takes into account children's health and commit to fully enforcing the Clean Air Act to clean up mercury pollution for old power plants.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA has come under fire since the Bush administration took over, the chief criticisms being its preferential treatment for polluting industries over public health as well as its manipulation and distortion of science. Political appointees at EPA also cut the agency's own scientific advisory panel on mercury out of the rulemaking process and told its staff experts not to do routine economic analysis of the rule.  Last month, the Bush administration drew a sharp rebuke from the EPA Inspector General for its handling of this issue.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By appointing Johnson, a long-time EPA employee and a scientist, the Bush administration has sought to allay these concerns.  Still, the administration has shown no sign of backing down and remains committed to the flawed policy.  Johnson is in a position to push back by putting forth a rule that protects children from mercury exposure and strongly enforces current clean air laws.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
