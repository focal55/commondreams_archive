<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 12 - Exposing and changing ExxonMobil&#146;s irresponsible and deceptive behavior is the mission of &#147;Exxpose Exxon,&#148; a new campaign sponsored by a coalition of America&#146;s largest public interest and environmental groups.  The campaign launched today with over 50 events outside ExxonMobil service stations around the country as well as online.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxposeExxon.com sheds light on the environmental track record of the world&#146;s largest and most profitable oil company, ExxonMobil.  The list of misdeeds includes actively lobbying Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, opposing efforts to cut global warming pollution, and shirking full payment on the damages due to fishermen and natives harmed by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;For years, ExxonMobil has intentionally put its own profits above a clean environment and the health of America&#146;s families.  As a result, we are asking all Americans not to buy ExxonMobil's gas or products, invest in the company, or work for ExxonMobil,&#148; stated the ExxposeExxon.com campaign coalition in a letter sent today to Lee Raymond, ExxonMobil's CEO.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans want clean sources of energy that protect public health, reduce pollution, curb global warming, and save consumers money.  Instead, ExxonMobil has continually worked to increase U.S. dependence on oil and failed to invest a significant portion of its record high profits into developing clean sources of energy, unlike its competitors BP and Shell.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ExxposeExxon.com campaign has just released a report titled, &#147;ExxonMobil Exposed: More Drilling, More Global Warming, More Oil Dependence&#148; (available online at <a href="http://www.exxposeexxon.com/report.pdf" target="_new">http://www.exxposeexxon.com/report.pdf</a>) details the ways in which the Texas-based oil giant has consistently moved the U.S. backward, instead of forward, on energy policy.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;ExxonMobil needs to shed its past as an irresponsible oil company and move forward as a responsible energy company &#150; one that won&#146;t drill to the last drop,&#148; said Gene Karpinski, Executive Director of U.S. PIRG.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign is mobilizing Americans to call on ExxonMobil to do the following:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protect, instead of drill in, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Support mandatory caps on global warming pollution<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stop funding junk science that clouds the debate on global warming<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Save consumers money at the pump and ease our oil dependence by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency and by supporting fuel efficiency<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pay all of the punitive damages awarded to fishermen and others harmed by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. <br> </font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The ExxposeExxon.com campaign coalition members include the Alaska Coalition, Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, U.S. PIRG, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Alaska Oceans Program, Natural Resources Defense Council, National Environmental Trust, MoveOn.org, and the Alaska Wilderness League.</i></font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
