<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UNITED KINGDOM -- February 10 -- In response to North Korea's statement that it is indefinitely pulling out of the Six Party talks and the first public admission that it has nuclear weapons, the international peace and environment group Greenpeace urged the country to immediately rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and to prepare a full diplomatic mission for the UN Treaty's annual meeting in New York in May.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace is disturbed, but not surprised, by North Korea's public claim of possession of nuclear weapons. The Six Party talks began in 2003 but stalled last September. They have been marred by hypocrisy and fault on all sides. While China, Russia, and the US fail in their international obligations to pursue nuclear disarmament, and are actively upgrading their nuclear arsenals, South Korea has been embroiled in controversy over its own experiments with nuclear weapons materials. Meanwhile, Japan is sitting on a massive 5 ton domestic stockpile of plutonium and plans to open a reprocessing facility at Rokashu-Mura, capable of separating much more plutonium.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Six Party talks have failed. Nuclear brinkmanship is inevitable in a climate of nuclear hypocrisy. Only when all countries pursue nuclear disarmament in good faith can we begin putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle,&quot; said Nicky Davies of Greenpeace International.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace believes that with each side accusing the other of intransigence, the only way forward now is for North Korea to re-engage in 168 party talks under the UN's nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only a return to the norms of international diplomacy under the auspices of the UN's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty offers a credible way out of run away proliferation on the Pacific Rim,&quot; said Davies.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
