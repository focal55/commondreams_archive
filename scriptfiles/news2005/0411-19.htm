<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- April 11 -- For the tenth year in a row, more than one thousand high school and college students from across the Northeast are travelling to New York to protest human rights abuses across the world as part of &#147;Get On the Bus,&#148; one of Amnesty International&#146;s largest entirely volunteer-led events. The event will take place on April 15th and will feature demonstrations in front of the Indian, Jamaican and Chinese consulates.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of Amnesty International local Group 133 from Somerville, Massachusetts organized the event, which begins with a speakers panel to address the protesters. Included in the panel are Gary Cohen and Larry Chang, who will speak from first-hand experience about the relevant human rights abuses.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstrations will take place at three different sites. At the Indian consulate, students will demand that the victims of the 1984 Union Carbide (UCC) disaster in Bhopal, India (the world&#146;s greatest human rights disaster arising from corporate negligence) receive just treatment and compensation from the Indian government and UCC/Dow Chemical. At the Jamaican consulate, activists will demonstrate for a repeal of sodomy laws and against a political climate that tolerates homophobic violence. Finally, at the Chinese consulate, protesters will call for the release of political prisoners such as Buddhist monk Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche. Many Tibetan political prisoners are tortured and ill-treated during their detainment and go without a fair trial or adequate legal support.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ten years ago &#147;Get on the Bus&#148; started with the goal of introducing young people to human rights activism. What started out as a small trip of 30 people has grown to include approximately 1500 from different high schools and colleges throughout the Northeast. Rita Lasar from &#147;September 11th Families For Peaceful Tomorrows&#148;, who spoke at the 2002 &#147;Get on the Bus&#148;, stated, &#147;It was such a joy to look out at that sea of beautiful young faces and know that they really care about the world and that they think about what they can do to change it.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHO:</b> High school and college activists, Amnesty International local Group 133,<br>Speakers:  Gary Cohen, member of the Advisory Board for the Sambhavna Trust and Executive Director of the Environmental Health Fund.
