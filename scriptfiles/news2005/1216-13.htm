<p>WASHINGTON  - December 16 - "Today, fair-minded Senators stood firm in their commitment to the 
Constitution and rejected the White House&#8217;s call to pass a faulty law," said 
Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "The 
Senate was our last, best hope to preserve our fundamental freedoms, and it did 
not fail. The Senators who voted to continue debate saw through the empty 
rhetoric and dismissed the notion that this damaged bill was in the best 
interests of the country. This was a victory for the privacy and liberty of all 
Americans."
<P>The ACLU noted that Senators from both parties vowed to continue to press for 
reforms and stood up for the protection of the fundamental freedoms of all 
Americans. 47 Senators voted against cloture, and both Democrats and Republicans 
spoke passionately about the need to protect ordinary Americans from government 
misuse of these broad powers governed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act (FISA). Many pointed to evidence that the secret records search powers 
expanded by the Patriot Act are being used with increasing frequency to gather 
the financial and Internet transaction records of innocent Americans.</P>
<P>The motion for cloture failed only hours after the New York Times revealed 
that the White House had directed the National Security Agency (NSA) to spy on 
people in the United States in violation of the FISA law. Congress passed the 
FISA rules in response to revelations during the Nixon administration of NSA 
spying on Americans on these shores in contravention of Fourth Amendment rights.</P>
<P>Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI), who was the lone Senator to oppose the Patriot 
Act in 2001, and John Sununu (R-NH) led the Senate&#8217;s opposition. Others 
instrumental in the vote against the cloture motion were Senators Patrick Leahy 
(D-VT), Harry Reid (D-NV), Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Larry Craig (R-ID), Dick Durbin 
(D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Ken Salazar (D-CO), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), 
Chuck Hegel (R-NE), Max Baucus (D-MT), Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Carl Levin 
(D-MI).</P>
<P>Had opponents of Patriot reform succeeded, their version of the bill would 
have allowed the government to continue seizing law-abiding Americans' most 
sensitive personal records without requiring a link between the records sought 
and a suspected foreign terrorist. It would also have left in place the 
automatic gag order that makes it difficult to challenge the government's secret 
record demands. The ACLU and its bipartisan allies, along with 400 communities, 
including seven states, continue to call for meaningful changes to be made. Also 
contained in the legislation is a proposal to revisit two Patriot Act powers in 
2009. The ACLU urged lawmakers to renew negotiations to ensure that precious 
anti-terrorism resources are not wasted on innocent Americans unconnected to a 
suspected terrorist.</P>
<P>"The White House used every means to protect easy access by the FBI to the 
private information of innocent Americans unconnected to suspected foreign 
terrorists," said Lisa Graves, ACLU Senior Counsel for Legislative Strategy. 
"Today&#8217;s vote is a beacon of hope for the continuing vitality of our Bill of 
Rights. As Congress continues its examination of the Patriot Act, it must add 
common sense protections to preserve our privacy. Americans from across the 
political spectrum insist that this law be reformed so America will both be safe 
<I>and</I> free."</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
