<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON -- February 18 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today heralds the end of cruel sports in the British countryside. The ban on hunting wild animals with dogs comes into force in England and Wales at midnight, after 15 years of campaigning by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). The new law makes it a criminal offense to use dogs to chase fox, deer, mink and hares.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW has campaigned relentlessly for this ban since 1989, arguing that hunting with dogs is both cruel and unnecessary and cannot be made humane by any amount of regulation. Its two full- time hunt monitors have gathered vital evidence of cruelty and malpractice by hunts. Following the ban, IFAW's hunt monitors will continue following hunts to ensure that they obey the law.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phyllis Campbell-McRae, UK Director of International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) said: &quot;The ban on hunting with dogs will radically change the landscape of animal welfare in the UK and worldwide. Britain has banned a traditional practice because of the suffering it causes to animals. This should act as an inspiration and example to other countries where animals suffer for human entertainment.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We thank all our supporters in the UK and worldwide who have helped us to achieve this victory for the welfare of wild animals.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign has included media events, advertising campaigns and forming close working relationships with anti-hunting members of parliament. It was supported by frequent polling that showed repeatedly that the majority of the British people thought that hunting with dogs was cruel and should be made illegal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDITOR'S NOTE: Hunting is already illegal in Scotland, following another successful IFAW campaign.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1969, IFAW is an international animal welfare and conservation organization that works to protect wild and domestic animals and to broker solutions that benefit both animals and people.
