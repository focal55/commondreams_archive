<p>WASHINGTON - December 14 - The Energy Information Administration predicted this week that gas will likely remain above two dollars a gallon through 2025. Because this is 50 cents a gallon higher than previously estimated, the Union of Concerned Scientists today urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to go back to the drawing board to strengthen its proposed fuel economy reforms. 

<p>"The federal government has finally admitted what the rest of us already knew: the era of cheap gas is gone," said Don MacKenzie, a vehicles engineer at UCS. "Now the government needs a fuel economy plan based in reality."

<p>NHTSA proposed a number of structural fuel economy reforms in August 2005; however, flawed assumptions in its analysis, including low, outdated gas price projections, stifled the potential gains from stronger fuel economy standards. The government's new gas price projections show that meaningful increases in light truck fuel economy are more economically practical than ever, because fuel-saving technologies that were not thought to be feasible become cost-effective as the price of gas rises. An analysis by UCS indicates that fixing the gas price assumptions would by itself lead to an increase in fuel economy standards two to three times what NHTSA proposed. 

<p>"It's up to NHTSA to use the latest, most reliable information available in order to cut oil dependence and save light truck buyers money at the pump," said MacKenzie. "The only question now is, will they do it?"

<p>NHTSA's plan was premised on other inaccurate assumptions as well, including an overstatement of the rebound effect (the amount of extra driving that occurs because of increased fuel economy) and a belief that real-world fuel economy is better than projected by the Department of Energy. According to UCS research, correcting NHTSA's flawed assumptions while incorporating realistic gas prices would mean that fuel economy levels could be increased 3-6 miles per gallon (mpg) more than NHTSA's 1.8 mpg proposed increase. (Current fuel economy standards will be at 22.2 mpg in 2007.) Increasing light truck fuel economy by 3-6 mpg would save the average light truck owner roughly $2,000-$3,000 at the pump over the life of the vehicle.
