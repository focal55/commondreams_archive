WASHINGTON - November 3 - The Senate once again  missed an important opportunity to reform the agricultural  subsidy program that is rife with fraud and abuse by voting down  the Grassley-Dorgan amendment to the budget reconciliation bill,  said international agency Oxfam America today. </p>
<p>   Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan introduced an amendment to  the budget reconciliation bill on the Senate floor today to cap  farm payments at $250,000 and eliminate the loopholes that have  allowed mega farms to collect subsidies that exceed $1 million.  In the budget reconciliation effort, both the House and the  Senate were tasked to find $3 billion in savings from the  agriculture budget, mainly from three programs: anti-hunger,  conservation and commodities. Last week, the Senate voted to  slash funding for conservation programs to find a large part of  the necessary funding. The amendment would have provided enough  savings to alleviate a large portion of the cuts made to  conservation programs, while protecting important nutrition  programs from the chopping block.</p>
<p>   &quot;We are disappointed that the Senate missed an opportunity to  get on the path to a more equitable and sustainable farm  program,&quot; said Charly Moore, legislative director for Oxfam  America. &quot;The payment limits amendment offered hope for  revitalizing small farms here and in developing countries, but  vested interests convinced enough Senators to vote it down.&quot;</p>
<p>   Current U.S. subsidies are calculated based on acreage and the  quantity of volume produced, so the largest industrial-sized  farms receive the most subsidies and gain the most advantage from  loopholes in the law. This built-in incentive to produce and  expand creates surpluses which cause prices to fall, putting  smaller farms at a disadvantage. While large farmers benefit  richly, small family farmers -- here and abroad -- struggle. In  fact, according to the USDA, over half of all farmers and  ranchers in America do not collect government subsidy payments.  And of those who do, a very small percentage of producers (8  percent) receive a wide majority of the payments (78 percent).</p>
<p>   &quot;Congress should fund a sustainable farm program, not one that  hurts family farms by encouraging consolidation and over  production,&quot; continued Moore. &quot;Instead, today's move demonstrated  the power that a small number of farming operations have in  maintaining an antiquated farm program.&quot;</p>
<p>   Limiting agricultural payments could have also encouraged  international trade negotiators at the World Trade Organization  (WTO) in preparations for the Hong Kong ministerial in December.  Negotiations have been stalled on agriculture, with the issue of  agricultural subsidies taking center court. </p>
<p>   &quot;President Bush has stated his administration's commitment to  reform trade distorting subsidies, but Congress isn't listening,&quot;  said Moore. &quot;This vote indicates to US trade negotiations what  Congress thinks about real subsidy reform -- not much.&quot;</p>
