<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- American consumers will spend more than $5 billion more at the gas pump in 2005 than they should have to because of shortsighted automobile fuel economy policies, according to a report released today by U.S. PIRG.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the fourth anniversary of President Bush's release of his energy plan, U.S. PIRG released a new report - &quot;America Idles: President Bush's Inaction Costs Americans $5 Billion at the Pump in 2005.&quot; The report details what consumers could be saving had the Bush administration increased fuel economy four years ago.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Last month, President Bush wished he had a magic wand to lower gas prices, but with the stroke of an ordinary pen, he could require cars to go farther on a gallon of gas,&quot; said Anna Aurilio, Legislative Director for U.S. PIRG. &quot;Instead President Bush continues to push for an energy bill that won't save oil or protect consumers.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the report, had President Bush increased the fuel economy of cars and light trucks to 40 mpg over ten years in 2001, consumers, the environment, and the U.S. economy would already be reaping the benefits. Although the policy would still be phasing in, more efficient cars would already be entering the market.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report shows that in 2005 alone:<br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. would be consuming 350,000 fewer barrels of oil per day. This is more than half of current U.S. imports from Iraq.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Consumers would be saving more than $5 billion at the gas pump or about $300 per new vehicle.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The U.S. would be reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary gas responsible for global warming, by 23.9 million tons. This is equivalent to taking four million average vehicles off the road.<br></font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The best way to reduce America's dependence on oil and save consumers money at the pump is to make cars that go farther on a gallon of gas,&quot; continued Aurilio. &quot;Unfortunately, the House energy bill and the President's plan are driving America in the wrong direction.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month, the House of Representatives passed an energy bill that gives new tax breaks to the oil and gas industry while doing nothing to increase fuel economy. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has concluded that the policies outlined in last year's virtually identical bill would increase U.S. imports of foreign oil by 85 percent by 2025 and do nothing to lower gasoline prices in the short or long-term.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, EIA has reported that drilling in the Arctic Refuge would not have any impact on world oil prices and the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the oil found in the Arctic Refuge would meet the energy needs of the U.S. for less than one year. Increasing the fuel economy of cars to 40 mpg, however, would save at least four times as much oil each day by 2020 as the Arctic Refuge would produce each day at its peak.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress and the Bush Administration have wasted four years on an energy policy that won't give consumers any relief or reduce America's dependence on oil,&quot; concluded Aurilio. &quot;Congress should once again reject this disastrous energy bill. The President should pick up a pen and require that cars go farther on a gallon of gas.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>U.S. PIRG is the national advocacy office for the state Public Interest Research Groups.
