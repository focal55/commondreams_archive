<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">July 26 - Greens gathering in Tulsa for the national meeting of the Green Party of the United States this past weekend elected new national co-chairs of the party.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The party's National Committee elected the new officers on Sunday morning, July 24.  The new co-chairs, who serve on the Green Party's steering committee, are Pat LaMarche (Maine) and Rebecca Rotzler (New York).  Steve Kramer (Maryland) was reelected co-chair.  Holly Hart (Iowa) was elected secretary of the national party.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They join sitting co-chairs Gwen Wages (Mississippi), Marc Sanson (Illinois), and Jody Haug (Washington) and treasurer Jake Schneider (Wisconsin), who were elected in 2004.  One seat was left vacant in the election and will be filled through a runoff. (Steering committee terms are two years; elections are staggered, with half the committee elected every year.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. LaMarche ran for Governor of Maine in 1998 and was nominated for Vice President of the United States in 2004.  During the Tulsa meeting, Ms. LaMarche announced Maine's record number of Green registrants: 24,155 Maine voters were reported registered Green in November, 2004, up 50% from 16,169 Green registrants in November, 2002.  At 2.3%, the 2004 number is the highest per capita percentage of registered Greens in any state.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Rotzler, who is a Yupik Eskimo and originally from Alaska, is Deputy Mayor of New Paltz, New York and serves as co-chair of the Green Party's Peace Action Committee, leading Greens in their opposition to the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Hart currently serves as co-chair of the Green Party's Platform Committee and is the National Women's Caucus delegate to the Green Party's National Committee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also in the past week, Nancy Allen (Maine) stepped down from her position as one of two Media Coordinators for the Green Party. Starlene Rankin (California) replaces Ms. Allen, joining Scott McLarty (District of Columbia).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens also congratulated singer, guitarist, and acclaimed songwriter Bonnie Raitt, who will receive the Harry Chapin Memorial Humanitarian Award during the opening session of the 47th annual convention of National Association of Recording Merchandisers in San Diego on August 12.  Ms. Raitt is a member of the Green Party of California.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ms. Raitt's efforts to stop war in Central America, participation in the Sun City anti-apartheid project, performances at 'No Nukes' concerts, dedication to ecology and rights for women and Native Americans, and work to ensure higher royalties for older R&amp;B musicians are all consistent with all the best Green principles,&quot; said Rebecca Rotzler.  &quot;We're enormously proud that a member of the Green Party will receive the Harry Chapin Award this year.  Congratulations, Bonnie!&quot;</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
