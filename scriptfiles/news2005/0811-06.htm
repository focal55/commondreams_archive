<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->ROCKLAND, Maine - August 11 - The Island Institute, Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT), and Chewonki Foundation today signed purchase and sale agreements to transfer the ownership of six coastal Maine islands from the Institute to the two other organizations. The islands-Hungry and Black in Muscongus Bay, Campbell Island off Deer Isle, Russ Island off Stonington, Crow in the Muscle Ridge, and Two Bush near Matinicus-will enjoy lasting protection under the transfer agreement. Chewonki will buy the four larger islands (Hungry, Russ, Black and Campbell) that have a tradition of public recreational use. Maine Coast Heritage Trust will acquire Crow and Two Bush islands with the hope of eventually transferring them to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for permanent protection as bird habitat. Crow is used by nesting eagles, and Two Bush is an important seabird nesting colony. Closing on the transactions is anticipated to occur within the next year.

<p>"This transfer will allow these islands to be protected by organizations whose primary mission is land management and conservation, while allowing the Institute to focus on its primary mission of supporting programs that sustain working waterfronts and year-round island and coastal communities," said Island Institute President Philip Conkling. "We acquired these islands more than 15 years ago when securing recreational access was a central part of our work. This agreement with Maine Coast Heritage Trust and Chewonki is a wonderful way for all our organizations to focus on what each does best."

<p>"These islands offer a tremendous variety of recreational value for the public, including picnicking, exploring, camping, and nature watching. We're very pleased to be ensuring these opportunities for current and future generations," said MCHT President Jay Espy. Chewonki President Don Hudson noted that "Chewonki campers and students have been traveling along the coast by sail, canoe, and kayak since 1918. Our access for camping has declined sharply in the past 10 years. We are very excited to be acquiring these four islands, as their purchase will guarantee overnight access for Chewonki campers and the public-forever-along two important stretches of the coast. We look forward to working with the Maine Island Trail Association, MCHT, and local land trusts for the management of the campsites available to the public, as well as the conservation values protected by the easements." 

<p>Prior to the sale to Chewonki, the Island Institute will convey to MCHT permanent conservation restrictions that guarantee continued public access on Russ, Hungry and Black Islands. The restrictions will protect wildlife habitat and tightly limit development by allowing only minor structures (tent platforms, steps, signs, etc.) to accommodate public use over time on all three islands. In addition, the restrictions on Hungry and Russ Islands will designate a small, secluded area for Chewonki program use and additional improvements, and will allow for one small dock on Hungry. Similar restrictions already exist for Campbell Island, and are held by the local Island Heritage Trust.

<p>Background on the organizations involved in the island transfer agreement:

<p>The Island Institute is a non-profit organization that serves as a voice for the balanced future of the islands and waters of the Gulf of Maine. We are guided by an island ethic that recognizes the strength and fragility of Maine's island and coastal communities and the finite nature of the Gulf of Maine ecosystems. Along the Maine coast, the Island Institute seeks to: support the islands' year-round communities; conserve Maine's island and marine biodiversity for future generations; develop model solutions that balance the needs of the coast's cultural and natural communities; and provide opportunities for discussion over responsible use of finite resources, and information to assist competing interests in arriving at constructive solutions. 
<p>Maine Coast Heritage Trust is a statewide conservation organization dedicated to protecting land that is essential to the character of Maine, its coastline and islands in particular. Since 1970, more than 120,000 acres and 250 entire coastal islands have been permanently protected. 
<p>The Chewonki Foundation has offered a broad range of environmental education programs for students of all ages on Chewonki Neck in Wiscasset for 90 years, and more recently on big Wood Pont in Attean Township, Sunday Cover on Lake Umbagog, and at the Big Eddy on the West Branch of the Penobscot River near Baxter State Park. Wilderness tripping has been a part of the fabric of every Chewonki program since the inception of Camp Chewonki in 1915, as has nature study and conservation education. The nonprofit organization was created in 1962, and the charter provides for environmental education and land conservation-hand in hand.
