<p>WASHINGTON - Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has filed a brief this week in a lawsuit CREW brought against the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) in the District Court for the District of Columbia. CREW’s suit is based on the NIGC’s failure to adequately respond to CREW’s Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA). CREW filed the FOIA after learning that Members of Congress, lobbyists and Christian activists were working with Jack Abramoff to benefit certain Indian casinos at the expense of other Indian tribes. Indian casinos fall under NIGC’s jurisdiction.

<p>CREW had asked NIGC to produce any records relating to contacts that NIGC had with the major players in the Indian gaming scandals including; former Majority Leader of the House Tom DeLay (R-TX), Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL), Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH), Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), Jack Abramoff, David Safavian, Mike Scanlon, James Dobson, Ralph Reed, Scott Reed, Grover Norquist and head of the Counsel of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy, Italia Federici. CREW’s initial request included any contacts from January 1, 2001 through March 18, 2005, the date of CREW’s original FOIA request.

<p>The FOIA requires federal agencies to respond to requests for records within 20 days of receipt of the request, which the NIGC failed to do. After NIGC failed to respond to CREW’s request, CREW sued the Commission in federal court. Only after CREW filed suit did NIGC respond to CREW’s request. On May 9, 2005, NIGC sent a letter stating that the Commission had discovered only 14 relevant documents, but it withheld 13 of them claiming that they were exempt from FOIA. The one document NIGC released was a portion of a document described as a “draft bill sent to House Speaker Hastert.” 

<p>On May 19, 2005, NIGC released the additional 12 pages of Speaker’s Hastert draft bill and newspaper articles, documents the NIGC had previously -- and erroneously -- claimed it could not legally produce.

<p>CREW has challenged NIGC’s response as patently inadequate. Although NIGC claims to be involved in multiple investigations relating to the Indian gaming scandal, it has identified only a handful of documents that it claims to have that are responsive to CREW’s requests. 

<p>Melanie Sloan, CREW’s executive director, said “The NIGC is either running a lackluster investigation or illegally withholding documents, or both. Regardless, the American public deserves to know what NIGC’s dealings were with these officials, including now-indicted former GSA Chief of Staff David Safavian and former Majority Leader Tom DeLay.” Sloan continued, “We will not sit by and allow the Administration to ignore the law and their responsibilities to the public. We will fight to learn the extent of Jack Abramoff’s influence in Congress and the Administration.”
