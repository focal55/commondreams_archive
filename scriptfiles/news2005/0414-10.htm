<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 14 -- Today, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) launched a new website -- <a href="http://www.JackintheHouse.org/" target="_new">http://www.JackintheHouse.org</a>. The site aims to educate the American public about the relationships between Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, members of Congress and Republican activists. Abramoff is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, JackintheHouse.org explores the relationships between Abramoff and embattled House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH), Christian activist Ralph Reed, conservative guru Grover Norquist; Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA), Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;CREW created JackintheHouse.org to provide the public with a clear map of the unscrupulous back-room deals between Abramoff and members of Congress, who received trips and generous campaign contributions from Abramoff and his clients&quot; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW. &quot;The American public has a right to know that Members of Congress are trading legislation for luxury golf vacations and campaign contributions.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site also provides a means for visitors to urge the Chairman of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, Doc Hastings (R-WA), and the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, George Voinovich (R-OH), to initiate ethics investigations into Members of Congress who appear to have been improperly influence by Abramoff.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="mailto:JackintheHouse.org" target="_new">JackintheHouse.org</a> is a project of CREW -- <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/" target="_new">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a> -- a non-partisan, non-profit organization that targets government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
