<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 21 --  Free Press, the nonpartisan media reform group, and the Center for Media and Democracy filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission today, urging FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin to investigate broadcasters who distribute government-sponsored news reports without identifying their source.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly 40,000 concerned citizens have already signed a petition circulated by the two groups last week calling on the FCC, Congress and local broadcasters to &quot;stop fake news.&quot; The petition, available at <a href="http://www.freepress.net/action/fakenews" target="_new">www.freepress.net/action/fakenews</a>, seeks to strengthen and enforce laws against government propaganda and demands &quot;that the Bush administration stop using our tax dollars to create fake news reports.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Both the Bush administration and local broadcasters must be held accountable for this betrayal of the public trust,&quot; said Josh Silver, executive director of Free Press. &quot;The FCC needs to take quick action to investigate and eradicate news fraud and enforce the existing laws against payola. Congress must enact new laws that will stop government-funded fake news from airing without a disclaimer.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A March 13 article in the New York Times identified 20 federal agencies that used taxpayer funds to produce television news segments promoting Bush administration policies. These &quot;video news releases,&quot; or VNRs, were broadcast on hundreds of local news programs without disclosing their source.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least three investigations by Congress' Government Accountability Office (GAO) previously concluded that these segments constitute illegal &quot;covert propaganda.&quot; Yet the White House recently instructed all executive branch agencies to ignore the GAO findings and continue to produce VNRs.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January, after receiving nearly 20,000 complaints from Free Press activists, the FCC launched an investigation into federal money received by &quot;payola pundit&quot; Armstrong Williams from the Department of Education. The FCC has not yet released any information on the progress of that inquiry.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Free Press and the Center for Media and Democracy are also working with local groups to establish &quot;citizen agreements&quot; with local stations, under which broadcasters pledge to clearly identify or label pre-packaged reports produced by the government.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Not labeling fake news produced by the government or corporations constitutes news fraud, plagiarism, and violates the most basic ethical standards of journalism,&quot; said John Stauber, executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy. &quot;Fortunately, there is a simple solution for TV news producers: Do not use VNRs, or, if you do, label them on-air showing who provided and paid for them.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To learn more about news fraud, payola pundits and government propaganda, read the in-depth report from Free Press at <a href="http://www.freepress.net/propaganda" target="_new">http://www.freepress.net/propaganda</a>.<br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Free Press (<a href="http://www.freepress.net/" target="_new">www.freepress.net</a>) is a national, nonpartisan organization working to increase informed public participation in media policy and to promote a more competitive, public-interest-oriented media system.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center for Media and Democracy publishes PR Watch (<a href="http://www.prwatch.org/" target="_new">www.prwatch.org</a>), a newsletter which investigates and exposes how the public relations industry and other professional propagandists manipulate public information, perceptions and opinion on behalf of governments and special interests.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
