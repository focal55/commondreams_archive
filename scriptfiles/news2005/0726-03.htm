<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 26 - Privacy, consumer and children&#146;s advocates sent letters today to key Members of Congress, asking them to investigate the marketing and sale of mobile phones to children, and their effects on children&#146;s privacy, education, safety and health.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letters were written and organized by Commercial Alert, and sent to all members of the commerce committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.  The letter follows.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear _________:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 6th, the Walt Disney Internet Group and Sprint announced their intention to offer wireless telephone service to children 8-12 years of age.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was just the latest in what is emerging as an industry trend.  Earlier this year, Firefly Mobile enlisted 100,000 children for their mobile phone service. Enfora has announced plans to offer mobile phone service targeting children as young as six years of age.  This fall, Wherify is planning to offer a &#147;Wherifone&#148; for children with built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) location tracking.  In August, Mattel is expected to market Barbie-branded mobile phones.  Hasbro is preparing its own mobile phone for children, too, called &#147;Chat Now.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The targeting of young children as the next growth market for the telecom industry is one of the worst ideas to appear in the American economy in a long time.  Does anyone really believe that kids today lack sufficient distractions from their school work, that there are insufficient disruptions in the home, and that child predators and advertisers lack sufficient means of access to kids?  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the Disney Corporation and the others just wanted to give children a way to contact parents in emergencies, that would be one thing.  The telecommunications companies &#150; to parents at least &#150;are playing up this angle.  Telecommunications lobbyists in Washington will harp on it as well.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But despite the industry&#146;s rhetoric, Disney and the telecommunications companies really want to use children as conduits to their parents&#146; wallets. And marketers want another way to bypass parents and speak directly to the nation&#146;s children. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Already, marketers are leaping to send advertisements via mobile phones.  For example, Advertising Age reported on July 11th that many corporations, including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Timex, are moving &#147;from small [mobile phone advertising] tests to all-out campaign[s].&#148;  Children already are bombarded with too much advertising. They don&#146;t need more advertising through their mobile phones, whether it is telemarketing, text message marketing, adver-games, or any other type of commercial messages.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before the telecommunications industry declares &#147;open season&#148; upon the children of this country, we urge you to investigate and make absolutely certain that the industry has answers to the following questions. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Child Predators.  Will adults other than parents be able to contact children through these phones, without the permission of parents?  What about sexual predators, convicted criminals, etc.?</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Disclosure of Children&#146;s Whereabouts.  For mobile phones to work, telecommunications companies must know where their customers&#146; phones are.  Will anyone other than the child&#146;s parents, law enforcement officials and telecommunications companies be able to track the physical location of the child&#146;s mobile phone?</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interruptions in School and Church.  Will the mobile phones cause disruptions and distractions in church and school, or will they be designed not to function in such locations?  The potential for disruption here affects not just the individual child, but every child in the group in question.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Runaway Billing.  Will parents have absolute control over billing and charges, so that no charges can be incurred without the parents&#146; specific prior consent?  This includes charges for regular and special services, 888 numbers, and the rest.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children&#146;s Health. Children are vulnerable in ways that adults are not, physically as well as emotionally. In January, the British National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) issued a report, titled &#147;Mobile Phones and Health,&#148; which warned about the possibility that mobile phones could cause benign tumors of the ear and brain.  The NRPB recommended that parents not give mobile phones to children under eight years of age, that older children should limit their use of mobile phones, and that &#147;the mobile phone industry should refrain from promoting the use of mobile phones by children.&#148; Upon release of the report, NRPB Chairman Sir William Stewart said, &#147;I don't think we can put our hands on our hearts and say mobile phones are safe.&#148;  He also said that &#147;If there are risks, and we think there may be risks, then the people who are going to be most affected are children, and the younger the child, the greater the danger.&#148; How has the U.S. mobile phone industry factored this warning into its service plans?  Can it guarantee that children will suffer no adverse health effects from the use of mobile phones?  If not, then why is it offering mobile phones to children?  Is the industry willing to take full responsibility for the effects of its phones upon children&#146;s health?</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The move to put mobile phones into the hands of children as young as six years old is not a decision to take lightly.  It opens up a plethora of problems, not just for the children with the phones but for schools, churches, families and classmates as well.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now is the time to pause, investigate and consider.  Once the phones are in classrooms, playrooms, and in children&#146;s bedrooms, it will be too late.  Already we read with grim regularity of children molested by predators who contacted them over the Internet.  We read of children who cannot focus their own attention even for short times.  We hope we will not now read about children abducted by adults who seduced them through mobile phones, and of school rooms that cannot function because of mobile phones that ring constantly, just because Congress did not stand up and act.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,<br>Joan Almon, Coordinator, Alliance for Childhood<br>Michael Brody, MD, Chair, Television and Media Committee, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry<br>Brita Butler-Wall, PhD.
