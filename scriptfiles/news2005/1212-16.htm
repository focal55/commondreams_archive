<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - December 12 -</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the wake of controversy over CIA &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; 
policies and secret prisons, the American Civil Liberties Union has asked a 
federal court to reconsider its previous decision to uphold the CIA&#8217;s refusal to 
admit even&nbsp;the existence of two key documents on interrogation techniques and 
detention facilities abroad.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;As the Bush administration seeks to exempt the CIA from a proposed ban on 
torture, the American public has a right to know what interrogation techniques 
the CIA considers lawful and appropriate,&#8221; said ACLU Executive Director Anthony 
D. Romero. &#8220;President Bush himself has said, &#8216;we do not torture.&#8217; If that&#8217;s the 
case, why does the government continue to fight tooth and nail to withhold 
documents that would shed light on CIA interrogation techniques?&#8221;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two documents in question are a directive signed by President Bush 
granting the CIA the authority to set up detention facilities outside the United 
States and outlining interrogation methods that may be used against detainees, 
and a Justice Department memorandum specifying interrogation methods that the 
CIA may use against top Al-Qaeda members.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ACLU argues that the CIA improperly invoked a legal argument known as the &#8220;Glomar&#8221; response, under which it can refuse to confirm or deny the existence of 
the documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act. In legal papers 
previously filed before the court, the CIA claimed that to even admit that the 
agency has an interest in detainee interrogations would be damaging to national 
security. However, in a legal motion filed late Friday, the ACLU argued that the 
CIA&#8217;s claims are not valid because its own director, Porter J. Goss, has 
publicly acknowledged that the CIA does in fact participate in the interrogation 
of detainees.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;By its own admission, the CIA has publicly acknowledged that it conducts 
detainee interrogations following the Justice Department&#8217;s legal advice,&#8221; said 
Amrit Singh, an attorney with the ACLU. &#8220;Yet, in sworn declarations before a 
court of law, the agency argued that confirming even an interest in 
interrogation techniques would cause damage to national security. Not only is 
this argument meritless, it is also misleading.&#8221;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Goss was quoted by several media outlets in November defending the CIA&#8217;s 
participation in interrogations, saying that the agency uses interrogation 
techniques that are &#8220;unique&#8221; and &#8220;innovative.&#8221; He has also acknowledged that the 
agency uses or has used methods that would be prohibited under Senator John 
McCain&#8217;s proposal to ban &#8220;cruel, inhuman or degrading&#8221; treatment of detainees. </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein previously ruled that the CIA could invoke &#8220;Glomar&#8221; with respect to those two documents, but that the agency improperly 
invoked &#8220;Glomar&#8221; with respect to a separate Justice Department memorandum 
interpreting the Convention Against Torture, which had also been 
requested by the ACLU. Based on Goss&#8217; recent statements, the ACLU is asking 
Judge Hellerstein to reconsider his decision with respect to the two documents 
for which he upheld the CIA&#8217;s &#8220;Glomar&#8221; response.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On November 22, the CIA informed Judge Hellerstein that it would not appeal 
the decision on the Convention Against Torture memorandum, unless the ACLU 
decides to appeal the rulings on the other two documents.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ACLU&#8217;s motion is online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/natsec/warpowers/22585lgl20051212.html" target=_blank>www.aclu.org/natsec/warpowers/22585lgl20051212.html</A></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To date, more than 77,000 pages of government documents have been released in 
response to the ACLU's Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The ACLU has been 
posting these documents online at <A class=noline_blue href="/torturefoia/index.html" target=_blank>www.aclu.org/torturefoia.</A></font></P>
