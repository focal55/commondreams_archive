<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 19  -    A new TV ad calls on the President to keep his word and fire his top political advisor Karl Rove for disclosing the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson, a covert CIA agent.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad features White House spokesman Scott McClellan contradicting his 2003 statements when asked last week if the President plans to fire Karl Rove.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad begins airing tomorrow, within 48 hours of the President's flip-flop on an earlier commitment to fire anyone involved in blowing her cover.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June 2004, when asked whether he would fire anyone involved in the Plame outing, President Bush replied, &quot;Yes&quot; to a group of reporters. On Monday, however, the President flip-flopped and added the qualifier that it would have to be shown that a crime was committed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two senior White House officials, Karl Rove and Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, have been implicated in the scandal for outing the agent.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President should stand by his pledge to the American people and fire Karl Rove,&quot; said Tom Matzzie, Washington Director of MoveOn.org Political Action.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Karl Rove recklessly and maliciously revealed the identity of a covert CIA operative to discredit critics of the Iraq war. Rove either broke the law or was grossly negligent. In either case, he damaged our national security and shouldn't be working in the White House,&quot; said Matzzie.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In September 2003, Bush told reporters, &quot;I want to know the truth,&quot; after news of the investigation had burst into headlines. &quot;If anybody has got any information, inside our administration or outside our administration, it would be helpful if they came forward with the information so we can find out whether or not these allegations are true and get on about the business.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President should tell us who came forward, what that person said, and what action, if any, he took. He needs to keep his promise and fire Karl Rove and anyone else involved,&quot; Matzzie added.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad can be found on MoveOn.org Political Action's Web site at <a href="http://www.moveon.org" target="_new">http://www.moveon.org</a>.
