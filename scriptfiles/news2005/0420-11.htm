<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 20 -- Senator Jim Jeffords has always been a champion for clean air, for wilderness, and the health and safety of the people of Vermont and all Americans. For years, he has fought ardently for clean air and water, battling against polluters, standing up to defend America's beautiful landscapes, and staring down those who put profits ahead of our families' health.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club has long admired Senator Jeffords' courage and leadership on environmental issues both as a Republican and an Independent. Throughout his career, he has been a leader in efforts to cut wasteful taxpayer subsidies to polluting corporations, including the mining, grazing and timber industries. He continues to be a leader, working with the Vermont delegation to protect new wilderness areas in the Green Mountain National Forest.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He will be sorely missed by everyone who cares about clean air, clean water and the special places Americans love.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Jeffords' legacy will include:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Public Lands: Senator Jeffords was one of two Republican cosponsors of the Arctic Refuge Wilderness Act to protect the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from dangerous oil drilling. Additionally he has voted to protect our unique and beautiful national monuments.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Renewable Energy: Senator Jeffords has fought hard for funding for renewable energy programs that help reduce our dependence on more polluting energy sources, including sponsoring a measure in the Energy Bill to require 20 percent of our energy come from renewable sources like wind and solar power.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Clean Air: As Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, he led the fight on clean air, pushing the committee to support the Clean Power Act, which he introduced with Senator Lieberman. The bill would dramatically cut power plant emissions of the dangerous pollutants nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and carbon dioxide, which cause smog, acid rain, toxic mercury pollution and global warming.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smart Growth: Senator Jeffords set up the Senate Smart Growth Task Force, which includes 24 Senators committed to curbing suburban sprawl. He has introduced the Post Office Community Partnership Act and cosponsored the High Speed Rail Investment Act, both of which will help reduce suburban sprawl. He supported the Dairy Compact which helps preserve family farms and protects open space.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Family Planning: Senator Jeffords has been a leader on efforts to eliminate the anti-democratic Global Gag rule which bans US funding for family planning organizations in other countries to speak out about or provide legal abortion services using their own money.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Making Polluters Pay: Senator Jeffords has been a leader in the Senate on efforts to make polluting industries, rather than taxpayers, pay for cleaning up the nation's most heavily contaminated toxic waste sites.<br></font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Vermont, Senator Jeffords fought to keep our air clean by opposing International Papers plans to burn tires for energy across Lake Champlain and separately secured funding for the lake's protection. He has also been a vocal supporter for additional wilderness protection. In 1984, as a Representative in the House, Jeffords co-authored the Vermont Wilderness Act. In recent years he has expressed his support for additional wilderness in Vermont many times, recognizing the 73% of Vermonters who want more wilderness in the state Currently the Forest Service is undergoing a management plan revision which fails to recommend any significant amount of new wilderness to Congress. Jeffords continued support will help to increase wilderness in places like the Green Mountain National Forest.</font></p><p> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
