<td colspan="2"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">August 8 - Indonesian media reported that during the preliminary meeting of the  
Commission for Truth and Friendship in Bali, August 4, 2005, the Timorese  
foreign minister Dr. Jose Ramos Horta stated that the victims of crimes  
against humanity in Timor Leste do not wish for an international tribunal  
and do not press for compensation, what they wish for is to know what  
actually happened.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If it is true that the foreign minister made such statement, we believe  
that such statement is against the reality. During the meeting with the  
Commission of Experts, formed by the UN Secretary General to evaluate the  
crimes against humanity judicial process, the families and representatives  
of victims from all across Timor Leste had stated that they are demanding  
an international tribunal. They aid that the courts held in Indonesia  
cannot be trusted because it was but a charade to protect the people  
responsible for those crimes. On the other hand, the courts held in Timor  
Leste by the Special Panel of Dili District Court cannot be depended on to  
dispense justice because of lack of resources and cannot reach the people  
responsible who live in Indonesia.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few years before, during the farewell visit to Timor Leste in 2002 of the 
UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Mary Robinson, the families of  
victims and survivors met in various places stated their demand that  
justice be served through an international tribunal. Hence, at the end of  
her visit, Mary Robinson said, &quot;In all the places I visited, I have seen  
that the people of Timor Leste wish for justice. I hope that the leaders of  
Timor Leste would hear this wish and take the same position.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We do not understand the foundation of the statement of our foreign  
minister. We wish to ask, &quot;Where did the foreign minister conduct his  
consultation with the survivors and their family?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is true that there is no referendum to determine whether the people wish  
for an international tribunal or not, but various voices from various  
parties within the community assured us that an international criminal  
court is the only hope for the victims to achieve justice. The same opinion  
was also voiced during the many sessions of Audiensia Publike, held by the  
Commission of Acceptance, Truth and Reconcilliation. The same opinion was  
also voiced by the Timor Leste Catholic Church. In April, the Bishop of  
Dili Dom Ricardo and Bacau Bishop Dom Basilio do Nascimento sent a joint  
statement to the UN Commission of Experts, to ask for the creation of an 
international tribunal for crimes against humanity and other war crimes in 
Timor Leste from 1975 to 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The opinion that the victims and their families do not want an  
international tribunal is only a new excuse from a number of political  
leaders in Timor Leste, especially the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Jose  
Ramos Horta and President Kayrala Xanana Gusmao, to support their own  
opinion that Timor Leste does not need an international tribunal.  
Previously, the excuse was that Timor Leste needs an economic development,  
while the cost of an international tribunal is high and Timor Leste simply  
could not afford it. This is a baseless excuse. Timor Leste is not the one  
who would form and fund international criminal court because the crimes  
committed were violations of international law, and as such, the one who is  
reponsible to create it and fund it is the United Nations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another excuse thrown said that justice had already been gotten by Timor  
Leste, that is the independence. This is also a baseless excuse. Timor  
Leste was struggling for its independence from Portugal when Indonesia  
invaded and subsequently occupied the country and hence prevented the  
process - such invasion was obviously a violation of international law.  
Since the people were still committed to their struggle for their rightful  
independence, the Indonesian military committed various cruelties to stop  
it - which is also a violation of international law. So it is natural that  
a tribunal should be held for both crimes, to hold the people responsible  
for the invasion, the occupation, and other subsequent serious crimes  
against humanity accountable. It is the only way to ensure justice. Justice  
cannot be traded with economic development, much less a sort of  
&quot;compensation&quot; for the victims.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To state that an international tribunal is not needed by the people of  
Timor Leste is against the Timor Leste 2002 Constitution. The Constitution  
created by the democratically elected representatives is a reflection of  
the wish of all the people of Timor Leste. Particularly, article 160 of the  
Constitution stated that for serious crimes committed during 1975 - 1999  
must be resolved through a tribunal, national or international. Finding the  
truth is needed, by finding the truth does not automatically constitute  
justice. It is only a part that helps complete the process to achieve justice.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is ironic that Timor Leste, which for almost a quarter of a century was  
victimized by the attitude of large countries with &quot;realpolitik&quot; position  
that let the invasion, occupation, and various human rights violations  
during the occupation, are now voluntarilly follow the common  
&quot;realpolitik&quot;: the countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom,  
Australia, and a number of other countries do not wish for an international  
tribunal on Timor Leste issues.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We hereby demand the leaders of Timor Leste (which during the occupation  
struggle against unjust &quot;realpolitik&quot;) to go back to the basic value of  
justice. Do not forget that it is due to the people of Timor Leste who  
fought against unjust world &quot;realpolitik&quot; that we now have our sovereign  
and independent state of the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
