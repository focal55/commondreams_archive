<p>CHICAGO - December 13 - The Center for Justice &amp;  Democracy today condemned a report from the corporate front  group, the American Tort Reform Association (ATRA), that attacks  judges and juries.  In addition to Cook, Madison, and St. Clair  Counties in Illinois, ATRA's unscientific report attacks a number  of poor communities in the United States, including the Hurricane  ravaged Gulf Coast of Texas. </p>
<p>   The &quot;Judicial Hellholes 2005&quot; report from ATRA, an  organization supported by major industries and Fortune 500  companies, calls the Rio Grande Valley and Gulf Coast of Texas  the worst so-called &quot;Hellholes&quot; in the country, with Illinois'  Cook County (Chicago), suddenly becoming number two based on no  actual or scientific data. Also added to a watch list is the  nearly ruined Orleans Parish, Louisiana.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is incredibly brazen,&quot; said Amber Hard, staff director  of CJ&amp;D Illinois.  &quot;In this report, a corporate front group for  companies found negligent in court is attacking those who are  willing to hold them accountable.  With money and politics  already dominating the executive and legislative branches, our  court system is one of the only places left in America where  individual injured citizens can successfully confront powerful  industries and institutions, force changes in their dangerous  behavior and seek justice. Unfortunately, this kind of  publication endangers this tradition, which has served and  protected citizens so well for over 200 years.&quot;</p>
<p>   Said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the Center for  Justice &amp; Democracy, &quot;These kinds of bogus political attacks on  judges, particularly ones that target jurisdictions with poor and  minority populations, threaten our democracy. When corporate  front groups like ATRA orchestrate studies for the purpose of  attacking judges and juries for decisions that hold reckless  corporations accountable, the very foundations of our judicial  systems are threatened.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;As an indication of how inaccurate this study really is,&quot;  concluded Hard, &quot;three of the top six 'Judicial Hellholes' are  identified in Illinois. Yet Illinois is the 13th most desirable  state in the country to locate a business.&quot; In Site Selection's  2005 ranking of state business climates, Illinois ranked no. 13  in a ranking determined executive surveys, new plant performance,  and other criteria.
