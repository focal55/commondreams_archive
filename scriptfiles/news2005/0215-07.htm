<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 15 --</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One week after the Bush administration released a budget calling for deep cuts in low-income assistance, a comprehensive new report by the National Student Campaign Against Hunger and Homelessness shows that hunger and homelessness nationwide are increasing far beyond the capacity of the homeless shelters and food pantries to which many turn for help.  Funding cuts, such as the $1.8 billion decrease in the Community Development Block Grant proposed last week by the Bush administration, are exacerbating the problem.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Each year, hundreds of shelters, pantries and soup kitchens are forced to turn away people in need because resources are tight,&#148; said Kathleen Barr, author of the National Student Campaign&#146;s new report.  &#147;Yet the Bush Administration has refused to accept the reality that hunger and homelessness are increasing, and instead has proposed cutting even more funding from programs that help low-income people.  It doesn&#146;t add up.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Communities in Crisis is based on surveys of 900 emergency food and shelter providers in 426 small towns, large cities and rural areas in 32 states. Agencies in each state reported an increase in requests for emergency food or shelter; 74% of agencies reported an increase in food requests and 65% saw an increase in emergency shelter requests. On average, these agencies reported that food requests increased by 28% and shelter requests by 27%.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We&#146;re seeing more and more people struggling to get off the streets,&#148; said Elizabeth Gomez, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Youth Network.  &#147;It&#146;s truly heartbreaking to see the problem growing and not be able to provide enough shelter necessary to help everyone.&#148; Shelter requests increased at 72% of agencies surveyed in California.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charitable agencies are unable to help everyone who needs it due to inadequate resources.  Communities in Crisis reports that 77% of agencies turned away people in need of emergency shelter and 24% in need of food; nearly all attributed this to a lack of resources. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I&#146;m proud of our food bank and our community for all we do, but there are so many we can&#146;t help,&#148; said Brenda Rivera of the Allentown Ecumenical Food Bank in Pennsylvania. According to Communities in Crisis, food requests rose at 72% of agencies surveyed in Pennsylvania, by an average of 31%.  &#147;We support ourselves by donations from the community, but it&#146;s just not enough. We need help.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, Communities in Crisis also reports that government funding for social programs is inadequate and declining. More than one-third (35%) of agencies nationwide reported funding cuts from the federal government. Very few (18%) agencies saw funding increases from federal government despite across-the-board increases in need.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding cuts are devastating for agencies and for people experiencing homelessness. </font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 26% cut in funding for the Apostle&#146;s House in Newark, New Jersey forced the shelter to reduce the number of people served.   <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding cuts at the Salvation Army&#151;Harbor Light in Portland, Oregon forced the closure of a shelter for homeless women.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Findings reported in Communities in Crisis indicate that the Bush administration&#146;s fiscal 2006 budget is out of touch with the harsh reality of hunger and homelessness in our communities.  The Administration&#146;s proposals to cut funding for the Food Stamp Program by $1.1 billion, public housing by $564 million, and the Community Development Block Grant by nearly $2 billion will exacerbate hunger and homelessness.  The National Student Campaign Against Hunger and Homelessness calls upon Congress and the Administration to take these findings into consideration, halt all plans to cut low income programs, and instead to increase funding for critical homeless assistance, affordable housing, and food programs in order to alleviate the crises of hunger and homelessness in our communities.</font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Agency contacts available for interview upon request.</i></font></p><p> </p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Student Campaign Against Hunger and Homelessness is a nationwide network of students and community members committed to ending hunger and homelessness in America by educating, engaging, and training students to directly meet individuals&#146; immediate needs while advocating for long-term systemic solutions.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Read the report at <a href="http://www.studentsagainsthunger.org/" target="_new">http://www.studentsagainsthunger.org</a>  <br></font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
