<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 4 -- Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (&quot;CREW&quot;) cautioned that despite a late night vote in which House Republicans decided not to loosen some ethics rules, the Republican Caucus is still proceeding with a rule that would stop ethics complaints at the committee's door. The Republican leadership has proposed a rule that would require a majority of the committee's members to vote in favor of acting before an investigation could be initiated. Currently, if the committee fails to act on a complaint within 45 days, an investigation is automatically triggered.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director, warned &quot;this change will effectively short circuit the entire ethics process.&quot; Sloan continued, &quot;this amendment is nothing more than another underhanded maneuver to protect DeLay from investigations. Once fellow Texan and DeLay loyalist Rep. Lamar Smith has been installed as Chairman of the ethics committee, DeLay can rest assured that there will never be a majority vote to investigate either any new complaint against him or the one still pending before the committee.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sloan noted that the amendment would be likely to prevent investigations into the conduct of other Members of Congress as well. She pointed to several matters that bear investigation, including how the family of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) has made over $1 million over the past 8 years by doing business with candidates, companies and causes that Rep. Waters has helped; Rep. J.D. Hayworth's (R-AZ) and Rep. John Doolittle's (R-CA) use of scandal plagued lobbyist Jack Abramoff's luxury sky boxes to host political events without reporting the contribution to the Federal Election Commission; the $50,000 golf trip taken by Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH) and Jack Abramoff paid for by two Indian tribes; and Rep. Rick Renzi's (R-AZ) use of banned finances to fund his 2002 re-election effort as well as his failure to report to the FEC $39,000 in contributions and $101,000 in expenditures.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Congressman Chris Bell (D-TX), who filed an ethics complaint against DeLay last June stated, &quot;the rules changes the Republicans have proposed leaving in place would still be a body blow to an ethics process so weak it could barely withstand the slap of a hand.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
