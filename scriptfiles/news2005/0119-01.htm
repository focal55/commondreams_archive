<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -- January 19 -- ReDefeatBush, a Federal PAC based in Washington, will operate two of the main stages at the Counter Inaugural on Jan. 20 and hold by far the biggest social event that evening with its Counter Inaugural Ball at Dream, DC's largest nightclub. The stages operated by ReDefeatBush include McPherson Square, the permitted venue for protest that is closest to the White House and Senate Park, the permitted venue for protest that is closest to the Capitol and the swearing-in ceremony.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Highlights during the day on stages operated by ReDefeatBush will include several national political figures forming a government in exile, legendary voting rights activist Granny D and ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel's performance as Alexis de Tocqueville, who will take audience questions on the subject of Democracy in America. In the evening the highlights will include a dinner buffet and open bar for as many as 5,000 people, the ceremonial retirement of the name ReDefeatBush, the launch of Left.org, the new entity that will replace it, and the debut of a one hour documentary on the counterinaugural that will have been filmed that day entitled &quot;Left Up to Us.&quot; The video will be shown at Dream and to a worldwide audience via the Internet.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our objective is to make our parts of the CounterInaugural as family friendly as possible so that parents will feel secure in the safety of their children and come to the CounterInaugural events to show their displeasure with Bush,&quot; said ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel. &quot;We find that the desire for parents of small children to be away from any teargas or confrontation with police is identical to the desire of Members of Congress have for a venue in which public order is maintained,&quot; he added. Forty ReDefeatBush marshalls in bright orange vests will help keep order. Orange flags and arm bands will be distributed to participants.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two main daytime stages operated by ReDefeatBush will be at McPherson Square from 9 AM to noon and in Senate Park directly in front of Union Station from 12:30 to 5 PM.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At McPherson Square, the mistress of ceremonies will be former Green Party Vice Presidential candidate Pat Lemarche. The theme of the morning is &quot;Forming a Government&quot; and will include a number of people who can speak with passion, conviction and humor about the policies the American people would be seeing had the 2004 presidential election been administered fairly. For the morning of 1/20 in McPherson Square, the Secretary of State will be Ann Weaver, the career diplomat who resigned in protest over the war in Iraq. David Cobb, Green Party nominee for President, will present some of the policies that the Secretary of the Interior of a popularly elected progressive president would pursue. Lawyer and radio talk show host Mark Levine will discuss how an honest Attorney General would pursue criminal investigation and secure convictions from those guilty of crimes against democracy.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Legendary voting rights activist Granny D will also address the crowd, and ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel will perform as Alexis de Tocqueville, answering audience questions about Democracy in America. Musical guests will include rap artist Wil B, Swing States Road Show, Jack Chernos and the Real Department of Justice and singer/songwriter Yikes McGee. Lytel will conclude the morning with a presentation of Left.org, the political committee that will replace ReDefeatBush and will talk about the lawsuit it will bring under the 14th Amendment to reduce representation in Congress. Several thousand copies of a booklet inviting participation in Left.org will be distributed. Jayne Lytel and a camera crew will interview protestors at McPherson Square to find out why they are protesting. These interviews and highlights of events on this and other stages will be included in a news show to be shown at 10 PM that night at the event at Dream as well as on the Internet at 11 PM at <a href="http://www.left.org/" target="_new">http://www.left.org</a>. To ensure that protestors are aware of the Counterinaugural Ball at Dream, Left.org will hand out 20,000 orange armbands that say &quot;We Demand Honest Elections in Kiev AND Columbus&quot; as well as a reminder about the time and location of the Counterinaugural Ball.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At noon McPherson Square will be turned over to the DC Anti- War Network (DAWN) and an march will get underway to the ReDefeatBush stage at the U.S. Capitol. At Senate Park the program run by ReDefeatBush will get underway around 12:30 PM and include more music and speakers until 5 PM. The afternoon show will include Lytel performing again as Tocqueville and other featured speakers including constitutional scholar Asa Gordon of the Douglas Institute of Politics. Singer songwriter David Rovics will join the musical guests.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Dream (1350 Okie Street, NE, Washington, D.C.) ReDefeatBush will host a dinner buffet and open bar from 7 to 9 PM. The name ReDefeatBush will be retired and Left.org, a new political committee, will be born. The same musical guests mentioned earlier will perform. Tickets are $30 for those under 30 years old and $60 for everyone else. VIP tickets are $150 and Penthouse tickets are $500.
