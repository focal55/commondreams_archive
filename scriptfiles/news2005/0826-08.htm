<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 26 - National Park Service policies that have benefited generations of Americans and ensured protection of our national heritage have been secretly and sweepingly rewritten by Paul Hoffman, deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Interior for fish and wildlife and parks.

<p>The depth of concern expressed to us by men and women currently serving in the National Park Service and by those who have dedicated much of their professional lives to stewardship of the national parks is without precedent. The American people are proud of their national parks and place enormous value on their health and natural condition. As watchdog organizations, we share the concerns expressed by park professionals that these policy revisions depart radically from the fundamental stewardship ethic that has preserved our national parks from their beginning.

<p>We urge the Department of Interior to immediately abandon this rewrite, heeding the advice of National Park Service professionals
 who have effectively managed our heritage for decades.
