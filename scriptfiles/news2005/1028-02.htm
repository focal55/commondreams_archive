<p>AMSTERDAM — Greenpeace today published its combined annual summary of income and supporter accounts for 2004, which show a slight decrease in supporter figures and a stable income for the international environmental organisation.  

<p>Offices in Latin America and Asia continue to show an increase in membership with a combined increase of 80% in both regions a similar figure to the previous year.

<p>Worldwide, the organisation showed a decrease of just under 1% in its income and 4.9% in the number of supporters.   However, in 2004 many offices streamlined their reporting systems for both supporters and income, which is also affected by currency exchange rates.

<p>“The importance of Greenpeace and organisations like ours continues to be proven in areas of fastest economic growth such as China and India,” said Gerd Leipold, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.  “But the developed world must not rest on its laurels.  Governments and industry must not be driven by profits and politics but by a genuine interest in the future of our planet.”

<p>Income in 21 of the 27 national and regional offices dotted around the world increased. Only offices in Brazil, CEE, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Switzerland showed a decline.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.
