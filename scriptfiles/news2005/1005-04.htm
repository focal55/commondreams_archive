<p>WASHINGTON - AFL-CIO President John Sweeney urged flight attendants at Northwest Airlines to join the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA/CWA) today for more strength in their struggle to win fair treatment during the Northwest bankruptcy, and beyond.

 

<p>“We are aware of the sacrifices you’ve been force to make by Northwest Airlines, and the suffering it has caused you and your families,” wrote Sweeney in a letter to the flight attendants.  “I strongly feel that the best way for you to stand up for yourselves through the bankruptcy process is by affiliating with the AFA/CWA, and gaining legal and bargaining help, political influence at every level of government, and the kind of solidarity that money can neither purchase nor defeat.”  

 

<p>Sweeney pledged the full strength and resources of the American union movement behind the flight attendants’ efforts, and praised the merger of the Association of Flight Attendants and the Communications Workers of America (CWA).  

 

<p>For a copy of the letter please contact <a href="mailto:bholton@aflcio.org">bholton@aflcio.org</a> or call 202-637-5018.
