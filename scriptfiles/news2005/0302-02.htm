<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 2 -- News Advisory: The American Horse Defense Fund (AHDF), the nation's premier, active horse protection, education and advocacy nonprofit, urges everyone to come be part of the National Annual Capitol Hill Day for Horses, March 7, 2005.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Press Conference will be at 10 a.m., March 9 in room 1334 of the Longworth House Office Building in Washington, D.C. Members of Congress will be speaking. RSVPs will be much appreciated. A number of national and regional organizations will be present, including The HSUS, ASPCA, AHA and the AWHPC.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The focus of the Hill day will be on urging passage of legislation to reinstate the wild horse and burro protections that the Burns amendment destroyed (H.R. 297 by Reps. Rahall (D- W.Va.) and Whitfield (R-Ky.), with the goal of preventing any American wild horse or burro from ending up in a slaughter plant -- destined for foreign dinner plates, and the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act (H.R. 503) by Rep. Sweeney (R-N.Y.) that will end all horse slaughter.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an effort to educate the horse-owning public and make clear many alternatives to slaughter and euthanasia exist, the AHDF recently published a sought-after book, &quot;Alternatives To Auction &amp; Slaughter: A Guide For Equine Owners (A Better Way).&quot; The book is available on CD for $5 and bound for $15 and is 280 pages with state-by-state lists of a wide variety of researched resources. The book will be available at the news conference.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Registration forms and hotel details (special rate has been arranged) are available by emailing: <a href="mailto:AHDForg@aol.com" target="_new">AHDForg@aol.com</a> or calling 866-983-3456.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the people coming and the AHDF will also be advocating for the bill to end all horse slaughter which is much likelier to pass this year.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information between March 4-9 call 808-640-5867.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
