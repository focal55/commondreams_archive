Through floor statements, press conferences, TV and radio appearances and other actions, we will provide leadership for the American Public who has been waiting too long for our collective voices against the war.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This announcement illustrates the changing tide in Washington around the issue of the Iraq Occupation,&#148; says National Director of PDA Tim Carpenter. &#147;This caucus will allow a collective dialogue within Congress on this issue, in which the tens of thousands of grassroots activists within PDA will be working to support.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, Rep.
