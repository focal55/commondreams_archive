<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 13 -- Attorney Thomas Griffith&#146;s troubling record and serious ethical lapses &#150; including practicing law with a suspended license in the District of Columbia and practicing law in Utah with no license at all &#150; were not sufficient to prevent approval of his nomination on a 14-4 Senate Judiciary Committee vote today.  People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas said Griffith&#146;s status as a former Senate insider explains the strength of his support.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Sometimes in life, it&#146;s who you know that makes the difference,&#148; said Neas.  &#147;Thomas Griffith is unfit to serve as a federal appeals court judge. Not only has he practiced law without a license, but he has staked out radical positions against remedies to discrimination.  But I believe Griffith&#146;s status as the Senate&#146;s former Legal Counsel has regrettably trumped serious substantive and ethical concerns.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration&#146;s insistence on installing Griffith on the federal bench for life stands in stark contrast to its treatment of a Department of Justice attorney who practiced law for two years with a suspended license.  In that case, DOJ reportedly plans to file notices about the attorney&#146;s suspension in every case he worked on during those two years.  (Legal Times, March 21, 2005)  But instead of an investigation and corrective action, Griffith&#146;s record has earned him an appeals court nomination.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Griffith&#146;s disturbing record includes hostility to long-accepted standards for proving gender discrimination under Title IX.  He received a barely passing grade from the American Bar Association, and his confirmation has been opposed by Utah's largest newspaper, the Salt Lake Tribune.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more detailed information about Griffith&#146;s record, please see the March 7, 2005 and Nov. 11, 2004 letters from PFAW to the Senate Judiciary Committee by clicking here and here.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about judicial issues, see <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/go/independent_judiciary" target="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/go/independent_judiciary</a>. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
