<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 14 -- NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation&#146;s leading advocate for personal privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose, today called on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to square Administration policy with her self-described &quot;mildly pro-choice&quot; viewpoint by lifting the global &quot;gag rule&quot; on family-planning programs and releasing the $34 million Bush has blocked from the United Nations Family-Planning programs each of the last three years. Together, these two actions could prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion around the world.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In weekend interviews, Rice declared that, &quot;we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible,&quot; while still endorsing Bush's indefensible policies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America President Nancy Keenan called Rice&#146;s position on international family planning a contradiction: &quot;I don't see how you can claim to be for reducing abortion while enforcing policies that make abortion more necessary. As long as these policies stay in place the label `mildly pro-choice' will be as big a deception as 'compassionate conservative.' The Bush Administration&#146;s actions defy common sense&#151;and Secretary Rice should use her leadership to change them.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
