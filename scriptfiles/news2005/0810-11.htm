<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WASHINGTON - August 10 - Today, with the President&rsquo;s signature on the Highway Bill, Northeast Ohio will receive over $38 million in federal funds secured by Congressman Dennis J.

I am proud to have worked for over two years with my colleagues to secure this substantial federal investment in our community. Now, it is time to get to work improving our roads, building bike paths, and improving the quality of life of those living near train tracks. Today is a good day. Today, we are creating new high paying jobs in Ohio.&rdquo; </font></p>
