<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- January 6 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The court martial of Charles Graner for his role in the Abu Ghraib torture scandal should not be used to cover-up the responsibility  high-ranking U.S. officials had for the brutal torture of Iraqi prisoners, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR).   Graner is one of seven low-level soldiers accused of the horrendous torture that took place at  the prison in Abu Ghraib, but responsibility for the continued mistreatment and torture of detainees in Iraq, at Guant&aacute;namo and in Afghanistan &#147;did not begin with Graner and  should not end with him,&#148; said CCR President Michael Ratner. &#147;Any court looking into his guilt must go up the chain of command. It must address Graner&#146;s claim that he was doing what he was told to do,&#148; he added.</font><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Ratner, objective evidence reveals that the type of conduct Graner</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">engaged in was encouraged and possibly authorized by higher officials in documents including the August 2002 memo from Jay Bybee to Alberto Gonzales, which stated that the President could authorize torture in the name of national security and that defined torture so narrowly that even Graner&#146;s alleged conduct would not come within the definition. In his recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Gonzales acknowledged that he agreed with the Bybee memo at the time it was written. This memo became the basis for April 2003 DOD working group report upon which interrogation techniques were apparently based. Graner has a right at his trial to determine to what extent the Bybee memo was put into practice and to what extent his conduct was authorized.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is well known that General Richardo Sanchez and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld advocated a number of inhumane interrogation techniques including the use of dogs, hooding, sleep deprivation, stress positions and isolation. Any alleged conduct of Graner must be seen in light of those abuses. Furthermore, as the insurgency in Iraq grew, U.S. soldiers were under increasing pressure from Rumsfeld, who wanted &#147;actionable intelligence,&#148; and Sanchez, who wanted the military to &#147;manipulate emotions&#148; to get information. It has been documented that military intelligence asked the MP&#146;s to soften the detainees up at night and even complimented them for doing so. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;These are all euphemisms for abuse and torture. That practices like those seen in the infamous photos were deemed acceptable behavior is demonstrated by the existence of the photos themselves: there was apparently no fear of punishment for the conduct, or it would not have been recorded at all,&#148; Ratner stated. As one of the investigative reports looking into Abu Ghraib concluded, the conduct was &#147;almost routine.&#148; For all of these reasons, Graner should have a full right to prove that his conduct was authorized. It is time for the American people to understand that the highest U.S. officials were engaged in, authorized and tolerated the torture of other human beings. There must be an independent investigation and a special prosecutor appointed; the responsibility for torture should not be borne by seven low-level soldiers.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR represents victims of torture in Iraq and Guantanamo in separate lawsuits filed in the U.S. and has been the leading opponent of the Bush Administration&#146;s treatment of detainees being held in the U.S. and around the world.  CCR has also brought a criminal complaint in Germany charging Rumsfeld and other high-ranking officials with war crimes arising out of the Abu Ghraib.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
