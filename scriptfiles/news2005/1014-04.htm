<p>WASHINGTON - More money was spent on first-week television advertising for the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts than for White House Counsel Harriet Miers, according to the latest analysis of television advertising data conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and the Justice at Stake Campaign.</p>
<p>   Last week's television advertising campaign (Oct. 3 to Oct. 9) was dominated by Progress for America, which supports the Miers nomination. Progress for America was the only group to purchase airtime in the first week after President Bush nominated Miers on Oct. 3.  The group's two ads, which ran on national cable television, cost approximately $106,552. PFA spent more than two-and- a-half times more -- $286,165 -- in the week following the nomination of now-Chief Justice John Roberts in July.</p>
<p>   "Despite the large war chests amassed by both sides, wait-and-see is still the order of the day," said Deborah Goldberg, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. "So far, we've not seen a single dollar spent on TV to oppose the Miers nomination."</p>
<p>   Liberal groups did not buy any ads in the first week following either nomination.</p>
<p>   "So far, the extreme uncertainty over Harriet Miers has kept her nomination battle bottled up inside the Beltway," said Bert Brandenburg, executive  director of the Justice at Stake Campaign. "The feverish behind the scenes infighting among conservatives has not yet spilled over into the airwaves."</p>
<p>   More data, as well as storyboards and streaming video of all of the ads, are available online at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=55045&Link=http://www.brennancenter.org">http://www.brennancenter.org</a> and <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=55045&Link=http://www.justiceatstake.org">http://www.justiceatstake.org</a>.</p>
