<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- The Center for Justice &amp; Democracy applauds the meticulous work of four scholars &#150; three law professors and one professor of law and medicine &#150; who researched years of litigation in Texas, and found that neither jury verdicts nor payouts to patients were responsible for causing skyrocketing premiums for doctors.[1]  The study was released today.<br> <br>The Texas study, along with others done in past years of other states, undermines one of the central assertions of those pursuing misdirected efforts to cap damages for patients as a way of bringing down doctors&#146; insurance rates.  Payments, total costs, and jury verdicts have all remained stable and have not driven recent premium increases.  The causes and solutions to that problem lie with a largely unregulated insurance industry.<br> <br>We hope that state legislatures and Congress will be inspired by this latest study, as well as the recent actions by Washington State&#146;s insurance commissioner to refund excessive premiums to doctors, to explore real reforms that will end the unfair price-gouging of doctors.  Lawmakers must stop blaming juries, lawyers and injured patients for a problem that is clearly not their fault &#150; the price-gouging of doctors by insurers around the country. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>[1]  &#147;Stability, Not Crisis: Medical Malpractice Claim Outcomes in Texas, 1988-2000,&#148; released by The Center on Lawyers, Civil Justice, and the Media at the University of Texas School of Law, studied data from the Texas Department of Insurance from 1988-2002.
