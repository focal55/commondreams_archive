<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><P>WASHINGTON -- Feb. 4  -- Tom Matzzie, Washington Director of <a href="http://www.moveon.org" target="_new">MoveOn.Org</a> responded today to false charges by RNC Deputy Counsel, Michael Bayes:

<p>"The President is continuing a campaign of deception. The fact that the President's plan would cut benefits by up to 46 percent is drawn directly from analysis by the chief actuary at the Social Security Administration. ('Estimates of Financial Effects for Three Models Developed by the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security,' page 75: Estimated change in monthly benefit for retiree at 65...row 42 sets 2, 3 and 4). We stand by the ad. All stations are airing our ad as scheduled.

<p>"Ironically, the president is coming after us while he is deceiving the public. The president is misleading when he says 'Social Security is going bankrupt.'

<p>"Our statement is supported by an ideologically-broad range of prominent economists, including Henry Aaron of The Brookings Institution, Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute. Further, the benefit cut figure has been widely reported in major daily newspapers, including The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.

<p>"Instead of threatening TV stations and trying to infringe on the free speech rights of MoveOn.org, the administration should come clean and answer the following questions:

<p>-- How big will the benefit cuts be for future retirees?

<p>-- How much new debt will be required for their proposal?

<p>-- How many billions in fees will financial services corporations profit from privatization?"</p></font><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><div align="CENTER"></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
