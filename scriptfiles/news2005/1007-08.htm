<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - Today, in a shameful  abuse of power, the House of Representatives narrowly approved  energy legislation that tries to capitalize on a national tragedy  to further enrich big oil companies at the expense of public  health. The Republican leadership held a five-minute vote open  for nearly 45 minutes in order to squeak out a 212-210 vote in  favor of the so-called "Gasoline for America's Security Act of  2005" (H.R 3893) sponsored by Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas). Thirteen  Republicans and one Independent joined all 196 Democrats present  for the vote in opposing the bill.</p>
<p>   The bill does nothing to "provide reliable and affordable  energy for the American people" as it claims. Instead, it would  grant enormous subsidies to energy companies that are already  enjoying record-breaking profits, while removing key public  health and environmental protections. </p>
<p>   "The energy industry and their backers in Congress are  exploiting the victims of Hurricane Katrina to further line the  pockets of wealthy energy barons," said Earthjustice Legislative  Counsel Jim Cox. "The bill does nothing to ease soaring gas  prices, while doing everything to roll back clean air  safeguards." </p>
<p>   The bill seeks to delay existing smog cleanup deadlines until  2015 or beyond. A similar provision was dropped from the final  energy bill signed into law by the President in August because it  was considered too controversial. More than 150 million Americans  now live in areas where smog levels are high enough to cause  serious health problems such as asthma. </p>
<p>   The bill will also limit the development of clean fuels and as  a result, will likely derail the Environmental Protection  Agency's (EPA's) upcoming program to clean up pollution from  diesel engines before it even gets off the ground. The bill  attempts to justify these rollbacks by using the false assumption  that public health protections are preventing oil companies from  investing in the additional refining capacity that is needed to  supply an oil-thirsty nation.</p>
<p>   Many of the Act's environmental and public-health rollbacks  have absolutely no relation to the recent hurricanes, and no  relation to America's gasoline supplies. In other words, they  have no relation to the issues cited in an attempt to justify the  bill. </p>
<p>   All Americans are deeply saddened by the devastation caused by  these storms and support efforts to alleviate the suffering in  affected regions. Congress's response, however, should not  include the gutting of public health and environmental laws just  so oil and energy companies can profit.</p>
<p>   "Powerful special interests are trying to capitalize on these  catastrophic events to push a 'wish-list' of bad proposals," said  Cox. "We hope the Senate will recognize this proposal for the  industry giveaway that it is, and stand up for public health and  environmental protection by voting it down."</p>
