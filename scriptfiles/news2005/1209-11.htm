<p>NEW YORK - December 9 - A dramatic increase and  improvement in the international relief operation is essential to  avert a second humanitarian disaster in Pakistan, Oxfam warned  today. </p>
<p>   "The international community must work together and work  faster to fulfil their promise to prevent further deaths. Within  weeks, the window of opportunity to bring relief to hard-to-reach  areas will shut, the time to act is now," Farhana Faruqi Stocker,  Oxfam's Pakistan Country director explained. </p>
<p>   Thousands of people are suffering from upper respiratory tract  infections. Many survivors have still not been reached. Some  communities have told Oxfam that they have already started  digging graves before the earth is hardened by the winter. It is  a race against the onset of appalling weather -- but success is  still possible if the relief operation is scaled up now. </p>
<p>   The challenge is that despite scaling up, the UN relief  operation is not yet big enough. It is under-resourced and  under-funded. The UN is most effective in protecting survivors  when large numbers of experienced professionals are on the ground  to provide leadership, advice and delivery -- and clearly there  is still much more to be done. </p>
<p>   Donor governments must respond to the looming second disaster  of winter by increasing their funding to the UN relief appeal and  releasing what is already pledged. Despite 40 percent of funds  being committed 'on paper' to the fund, in reality it is only  25 percent funded, with 15 percent remaining locked in  commitments not yet delivered. The World Food Programme, for  example, is still short of US $115 million of the $182 million it  needs. Donor governments need to show the same generosity as  members of the public have. Unless the international community  provides the help needed, it will be people in the mountains who  will be paying the price. </p>
<p>   Heavy snows are likely to lead to increased movement of  people. Many more people are having to make the bleak choice of  staying where they are, for strong cultural reasons and in order  to look after their land and livestock. Time is running out to  reach them with the shelter materials they need to keep alive  where they are. </p>
<p>   Action is also needed to protect people who have left their  mountain villages to stay in the camps. Oxfam welcomes the  process initiated by the Government of Pakistan to transfer the  management of much of the relief operation from the military to  the civilian authorities, but cautions that this needs to be done  in a phased manner that supports the civilian authorities to  ensure effective camp management. </p>
<p>   Properly resourced, well-managed camps, combined with  provision to those who are staying in the mountains would see  people through the winter. Further deaths are not inevitable. </p>
<p>   "There is a real danger that this unprecedented natural  disaster will be followed by a man-made one", remarked Stocker.  "The international community has the capacity to do what is  required. It is not yet too late but further delay would be  fatal." </p>
<p>   EDITOR'S NOTES:  </p>
<p>   Oxfam's report, A Mountain to Climb, on what needs to be done  to prevent further deaths following the Pakistan earthquake is  available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=57887&Link=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/conflict_disasters/bn_asian_earthquake.htm">http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/conflict_disasters/bn_asian_earthquake.htm</a> </p>
<p>   Oxfam's earthquake relief response, and its international  appeal, began on 8th October. Oxfam has helped over  200,000 people including providing fully winterised shelter to  over 120,000 people made homeless by the earthquake -- in the  next few weeks will be distributing another 120,000 fully  winterised shelter packages. Oxfam's operation has included the  provision of winterised tents, blankets, corrugated iron sheets,  material for bandis (traditional shelters), water tanks,  latrines, hygiene kits, public health education, cash-for- construction-work activities, and de-wormers for livestock  owners. Oxfam has also been working to improve the conditions of  camps through winterisation and promotion of the involvement of  affected communities -- especially women -- in camp management.  Oxfam will be expanding our operation to reach around  512,000 people in total. </p>
<p>   Oxfam has been working in Pakistan since 1973, both in  disaster response and in long-term development. Around the world,  Oxfam works with others to overcome poverty and suffering.</p>
