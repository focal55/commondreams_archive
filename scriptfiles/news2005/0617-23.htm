NEW YORK-The U.S. military's inadequate 
checkpoint procedures in Iraq endanger civilians, including journalists, 
as well as U.S. service members, Human Rights Watch and the 
Committee to Protect Journalists said today in a joint letter to U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter called on Rumsfeld to immediately implement a series of 
recommendations contained in the military's internal investigation into 
the March 4 checkpoint shooting that killed the Italian intelligence 
officer Nicola Calipari and wounded Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian 
journalist just released by kidnappers.   
  
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. military investigators recommended installing temporary speed 
bumps and spike strips at checkpoints to slow down vehicles, 
launching a public awareness campaign to educate the Iraqi population 
about how to safely approach checkpoints, and using signs in both 
Arabic and English to warn drivers.   
  
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Iraqi civilians and U.S. forces alike continue to face unnecessary 
danger at checkpoints," said Marc Garlasco, senior military analyst at 
Human Rights Watch. "It's time for the Pentagon to follow its own 
recommendations to implement basic safety procedures."   
  
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The military's recommendations were similar to those made in 
October 2003 in a Human Rights Watch report on civilian casualties in 
Iraq. The report, titled "Hearts and Minds," documented 18 deaths 
resulting from actions by U.S. soldiers between May and September 
2003. Eleven of these came at checkpoints.   
  
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Developing and implementing new checkpoint procedures should be 
a priority for U.S. commanders," the letter noted. "Checkpoint 
shootings have sparked outrage among Iraqi citizens, undermining 
public confidence in the U.S. military."   
  
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three journalists and a media worker have been killed by soldiers at 
U.S. checkpoints. Journalists in Iraq have told the Committee to 
Protect Journalists that approaching a U.S. checkpoint remains a 
terrifying experience.
