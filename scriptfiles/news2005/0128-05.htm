The Justice Department's investigation is one in a series of Federal probes that have failed to inform the public regarding Riggs' role in several scandals with national security import.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;It's important for the facts to be en la mesa, as we say, on the table and so that we know what course of action may or may not be needed. The Riggs Bank is being fully investigated, and they'll be investigated in a very open way.&quot; <br>-- George W. Bush, July 21, 2004.</i> </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The attached PAI brief considers the lack of transparency with regard to the following issues: </font></p><p> </p><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CIA Complicity in Riggs' Illicit Activities</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Did the CIA ask Riggs to engage in activities that violated the Bank Secrecy Act, such as  illegal wire transfers or the creation of illicit accounts? <br>Was the CIA aware of Riggs&#146; illicit activities with respect to 9/11-linked Saudi Arabian accounts held by the royal family?<br> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Bush Connections to Riggs Executives</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Did Bush friends and Riggs executives Joe Allbritton or J. Carter Beese have any contact with White House officials or President Bush himself during the investigations by the OCC and the Justice Department or the recently completed negotiations? <br>Did the President speak with his uncle, an executive at a Riggs subsidiary, regarding the Riggs investigation?<br> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Saudi Accounts and the 9/11 Connection</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why have the Justice Department and the Senate failed to launch an investigation of the Saudi embassy accounts at Riggs even though one account has been linked to two 9/11 hijackers? <br>Did the CIA or any other Federal agency play a role in facilitating illegal transfers to and from Saudi accounts?<br> Riggs, Equatorial Guinea and the CIA</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Did the CIA or any other Federal agency play a role in facilitating illegal transfers to and from accounts controlled by the Obiang regime?</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
