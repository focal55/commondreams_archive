<p>WASHINGTON -
<p> <b><a href="mailto:Libertad48@san.rr.com">MARJORIE COHN</a></b><br />
Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and executive vice president of the National Lawyers Guild. She has written a piece titled "Harriet Miers: Bush's Pit Bull," which will be posted on <a href="http://www.truthout.org">TruthOut.org</a> today. She said: "Bush has nominated his Texas crony as a stealth appointment. Although the Senate will be hard-pressed to discover Miers' positions on the critical issues, she does have a long record of loyalty to Bush. ... Bush undoubtedly knows where she stands -- and it doesn't appear to be on the side of civil liberties."<br />

<b><a href="mailto:norman@accuracy.org">NORMAN SOLOMON</a></b><br />
Solomon, executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, appeared on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" this morning to discuss the Harriet Miers nomination and the Bush administration's record of spin. He said today: "Miers was present at the creation of the Bush presidency. Behind the scenes, she ascended to increasingly important roles at a White House that methodically promoted deceptive claims about Iraq in order to justify the invasion and occupation. This year, in her gatekeeping role as the White House counsel, she has routinely determined what information does or does not reach the president -- including, presumably, information about Hurricane Katrina. It's breathtaking that after the recent horrendous results of cronyism at FEMA, the president would nominate to the Supreme Court a lawyer whose key qualifications seem to involve a history of unswerving loyalty to George W. Bush." Solomon is the author of <i>War Made Easy</i>. He will be in Washington on Wednesday<br />
and New York City on Thursday. Video of his C-SPAN appearance will be posted <a href="http://c-span.org/homepage.asp?Cat=Series&Code=WJE&ShowVidNum=6&Rot_Cat_CD=WJ&Rot_HT=205&Rot_WD=">online</a>.<br />

Raskin is law professor at American University and author of the book <i>Overruling Democracy: The Supreme Court vs. the American People</i>. He said today: "The thing that's really stunning is that of all of the judges and lawyers and law professors in the country, Bush turns to his own White House counsel, someone who has been on his inner legal and policy staff for many years, as the person he nominates to the Supreme Court."<br />
