<p>WASHINGTON - November 9 - In response to reports that the IRS is considering revoking the tax-exempt status of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, California, based on a sermon delivered by the Rev. Dr. George Regas prior to the 2004 election, The Interfaith Alliance released the following statement by the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, president of The Interfaith Alliance. 

<p>"The Interfaith Alliance reaffirms our commitment to the IRS guidelines forbidding houses of worship to endorse political candidates. However, having read the sermon delivered by the Rev. Dr. George Regas on October 31, 2004, I see in it no violation of those guidelines. Dr. Regas was exercising the responsibility of all religious leaders to evaluate moral issues from the perspective of their respective religious traditions. 

<p>"The Interfaith Alliance is investigating why the IRS challenged this particular sermon and why the IRS issued a warning about the sermon at this particular moment. Knowing the Religious Right's passion for advancing H.R. 235, a piece of legislation which, if passed, would change the IRS guidelines to allow for endorsements of candidates for electoral offices from the pulpit and thus fundamentally damage the historic constitutional wall separating the institutions of religion and government. I must confess cynicism about whether or not this challenge at this time is meant to build support for the advancement and passage of this dangerous legislation."

<p>The Interfaith Alliance urges religious leaders, houses of worship, and candidates to honor the proper role of religion in civic participation and to read two publications by The Interfaith Alliance, One Nation, Many Faiths. A Campaign Season Guide for Houses of Worship and Religion and Politics: Running for Office in a Multi-Faith Nation. Both publications include "Do's and Don'ts on Religion and Politics."
