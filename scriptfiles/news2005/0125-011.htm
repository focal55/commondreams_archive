<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 25 -- Traprock Peace Center has created an historical index &shy; 'an early summing up' &shy; of the formation and growth of the the Campus Antiwar Network. CAN is an independent, democratic and grassroots network of student antiwar organizations. It has become an important, national network in the US student movement.  This history covers the historic student conferences in Washington and San Francisco on October 26, 2002 through CAN's actions on January 20, 2005. We will continually update the index, which currently has 6 pages plus a page on CAN's early history. <a href="http://www.traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar.html" target="_new">http://www.traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar.html</a><br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>This is a treasure trove of important resources on the US student antiwar movement. There are links to albums with many hundreds of photos; audio (mp3 and RealAudio) from CAN conferences, workshops and interviews; and document downloads that include &quot;Campus Action&quot; - CAN's journal; and reports on CAN's creation and actions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will see that CAN has been a prominent representative of the US student movement for students and other activists in Europe, Iraq, Palestine and Japan. Many international activists are found in these pages, including Jeremy Corbyn (Member of Parliament, UK), Helen Salmon (National Union of Students, UK), Omar Waraich of the Students Stop the War Coalition, UK; Tomomi Nakamura, Japan; Caecilie Buhmann, Denmark; and Professors Mkhaimar Abusada and Jihad Hamed from Palestine.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will also find antiwar activists and authors in the US who have worked with CAN: Mike Hoffman of <a href="http://www.ivaw.net/" target="_new">Iraq Veterans Against the War</a>; Professor Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University, Norman Solomon of the Institute for Public Accuracy, Anthony Arnove, Tariq Ali, Rania Masri, Jacob Park and Peter Camejo to name several.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Stop the War Coalition gave CAN a boost at its start, by sending Mr. Corbyn and Ms. Salmon to CAN's DC conference on January 17, 2003. The early history gets comprehensive coverage at <a href="http://www.traprockpeace.org/student_activism_2.html" target="_new">http://www.traprockpeace.org/student_activism_2.html</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please also see and link to CAN's website at <a href="http://www.campusantiwar.net" target="_new">http://www.campusantiwar.net</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
