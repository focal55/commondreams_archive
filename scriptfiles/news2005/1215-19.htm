<p>SAN FRANCISCO - December 15 – A former organizer for Ralph Nader's presidential campaign 
and co-author of the "College Not Combat" initiative on the San Francisco 
ballot last month will formally declare his candidacy for US Senate Thursday 
to unseat longtime Sen. Dianne Feinstein - and use the campaign as a 
referendum on the war and occupation in Iraq.

<p>Todd Chretien, 36, of Oakland, will launch his "A Million Votes for Peace" 
campaign at news conference and major rally of his supporters on THURSDAY, 
10 a.m. at Feinstein's office (1 Post Street in San Francisco).

<p>Mr. Chretien will be joined by anti-war activists from throughout 
California, including Green Party leaders Matt Gonzalez, Peter Camejo, Renee 
Saucedo and Aimee Allison, Richmond City Councilwoman Gayle McGlaughlin, 
National Council of Arab Americans representative Dr. Jess Ghannam and 
Mexican American Political Association (MAPA) president Nativo Lopez, among 
others.

<p>Mr. Chretien, who has said the current elections in Iraq will "solve 
nothing," will  comment on results from the elections during his Thursday 
news conference.

<p>He will also comment on Feinstein's support for the USA Patriot Act, her 
opposition to immigrant drivers licenses,  gay marriage and her support for 
the death penalty.

<p>The Green Party intends to run its most ambitious statewide race ever - 
because the Republican Party has not yet fielded a candidate against Sen. 
Feinstein, it raises the possibility of a two-person, Green v. Democrat 
race.
