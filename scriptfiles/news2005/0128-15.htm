<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -- January 28 -- Today the House Democratic leadership and Ranking Democratic Members sent a letter to the President asking him to direct the release of all contracts for secret publicity campaigns to promote administration policies.  The text of the letter follows.</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">January 28, 2005<br></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The President<br></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The White House<br></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Washington, DC 20500</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Mr. President: </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are writing to request that you direct each department and agency of the Executive Branch to disclose to the appropriate Committee of the House of Representatives all public relations and advertising contracts signed during your Administration.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the past year, multiple investigations have revealed that federal agencies have employed secret publicity campaigns to promote administration priorities.  </font></p><ul><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In separate analyses, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy violated the congressional prohibition on publicity and propaganda by distributing fabricated video news reports.[1]  </font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">        An investigative report by USA Today revealed that the Department of Education paid a conservative commentator to support the No Child Left Behind Act in television and radio appearances.[2]  </font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported the Department of Health and Human Services had a contract with a syndicated columnist who promoted the President's marriage initiative.[3]  </font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A newly released congressional report found that public relations spending has more than doubled during the Bush Administration.[4]</font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">        And today, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and Salon.com  reported that the Department of Health and Human Services paid another conservative commentator thousands of dollars to support the marriage initiative, including by speaking about the importance of marriage to churches and community organizations.[5] </font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These developments raise serious concerns.  Covert propaganda campaigns are unethical and illegal.  Those disclosed to date mislead the American people about public policy and deceive the news media and press about the credibility of critiques of Administration policies.  We very much hope the contracts revealed to this point are an aberration and not part of a pattern across federal agencies.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To assist us in understanding the scope of public relations and propaganda contracted for by federal agencies, we request that you provide to the Democratic Leader, and to the appropriate Committee of jurisdiction, the following:</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1)   All contracts executed during the Bush Administration with public relations firms, advertising agencies, public opinion research firms, media organizations, and individual members of the media, including any modifications of such contracts. </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2)   All subcontracts executed under the contracts identified under (1), including any modifications of such subcontracts.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3)   Any documents or communications that describe or assess the work performed under these contracts and subcontracts.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4)   A copy of the justification and approval documents for any of these contracts entered into using less than full and open competition. </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The possibility of a widespread practice of covert propaganda raises the most serious of concerns.  The Congress, the press, and the American people all deserve a full disclosure of the Administration's policy on such propaganda.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has already been nearly one month since the Democratic Leader and Ranking Members Henry Waxman, George Miller, David Obey, and Elijah Cummings wrote to you requesting full disclosure of these contracts.[6]  To date, we have received no reply to that inquiry.  Now that there have been additional revelations, we would appreciate your cooperation with this inquiry, and would appreciate a complete response by March 1, 2005.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rep.
