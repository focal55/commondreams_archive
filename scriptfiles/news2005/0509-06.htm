<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- May 9 --  Today, Ludovic Blain, Associate Director of the Democracy Program at Demos, a national voting rights and economic opportunity group, issued the following statement on a new ACLU-NJ study that outlines deep flaws in New Jersey's felon disfranchisement laws: </font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The study released today by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/" target="_new">ACLU</a> of New Jersey documents what many residents already know&#151;felon disfranchisement laws not only strip voting rights from thousands of New Jersians, and millions of citizens nationwide, but the confusion they cause often prevents eligible people from voting. That confusion is often the result of punitive barriers, erected by state and local election administrators, that prevent voting by people with criminal convictions who are actually eligible according to law. And this new report shows the depth to which these unfair, haphazardly administered laws are used to restrict voter access. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over the last few years, states across the country&#151;most recently Nebraska&#151;have taken bold steps to ensure that more eligible residents are able to vote, and have removed voter registration barriers for citizens with felony convictions. In 2003, Connecticut extended automatic restoration of the vote to people on probation&#151;a measure that should be implemented in New Jersey. And in Maine, Vermont and Puerto Rico, people can vote not only while on probation or parole, but even while incarcerated. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This new research confirms for New Jersey what other studies have revealed about disfranchisement laws around the country&#151;that they affect many more people than those whose voting rights they specifically deny. Millions who are eligible under the law are never informed of their restored right to vote, have difficulty registering to vote, and if they do get registered, are more likely to be erroneously &#145;purged'. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These laws, drafted with racist intent in a bygone era, should be struck down. Until then, election administrators like New Jersey Attorney General Peter Harvey need to be extra vigilant in protecting voting rights for all eligible citizens. He should make sure local election administrators are following the law, and not forcing eligible New Jersians to jump through hoops to register to vote. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And all American citizens, regardless of whether they are on probation or parole, should have a right to vote and then be strongly encouraged to exercise it.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about felon disfranchisement laws in the US and efforts to reform our election system, visit <a href="http://www.demos.org/" target="_new">www.demos.org</a>.
