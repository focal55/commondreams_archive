<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich issued the following statement today on the President's Avian Flu initiative: 

<p>"When it comes the worldwide threat of Avian Flu, actions speak louder than words. This Administration must take immediate action to end Roche's monopoly on the worldwide supply of Tamiflu. Roche's monopoly is an immediate and grave threat to the health and well-being of every American, and will dramatically hamper the international community's ability to respond to a worldwide pandemic. 

<p>"Compromising public health in order to preserve Roche's bottom line is irresponsible and inexcusable. While sitting on the patent to the first and best line of defense against an outbreak, Roche is holding the world hostage. This Administration cannot sit on the sidelines and allow this to happen. 

<p>"Roche is not taking the necessary steps to meet world demand for Tamiflu.  Klaus Stohr of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Influenza Programme has said it will take 10 years for Roche to adequately supply world demand for Tamiflu stockpiles.  The U.S. currently has stockpiles for less than 2% of the American population.  

<p>"Compromising our defenses against the avian flu is neither prudent nor necessary.  The U.S. government has the authority to issue compulsory licenses specifically because of circumstances like these (28 USC 1498).  If manufacturing licenses are issued, other qualified entities would also be able to manufacture the drug and the patent holder would be compensated.  

<p>"Breaking Roche's monopoly must be at the forefront of any plan to protect this nation against the real and growing threat of Avian Flu."

<p>Last week Kucinich, joined by Reps. Marion Berry, Ed Case, Pete Stark, Jerry Nadler, Peter DeFazio, Barbara Lee, Lloyd Dogget, Neil Abercrombie and Bernard Sanders, sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary, Mike Leavitt, demanding that the Administration take immediate action to issue a compulsory license for Tamiflu so generic manufactures can get to work shoring up our defense against avian flu.
