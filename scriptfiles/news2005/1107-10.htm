<p>SOMERVILLE, Massachusetts - November 7 - For the first  time, Farm Aid has released a &quot;coffee table&quot; book of photos and  essays to tell its story of 20 years of music for change. An  ideal gift, FARM AID: A SONG FOR AMERICA (Rodale, $35.00), will  bring inspired music and food from family farms to the forefront  this holiday season. </p>
<p>   FARM AID: A SONG FOR AMERICA features in-depth interviews with  Farm Aid President and Founder Willie Nelson, as well as board  members Neil Young, John Mellencamp and Dave Matthews, who offer  their reflections about food, family farming and music, revealing  the depth of their personal and family commitment. Readers are  given a front row seat at the performances of the vast and varied  roster of Farm Aid performers -- from Arlo Guthrie and Bob Dylan  to Eddie Van Halen, Phish, and Sheryl Crow. </p>

<p>   Never-before-seen photographs by rock photographers Paul  Natkin and Ebet Roberts reveal the compassion and commitment of  dozens of Farm Aid artists including the late Johnny Cash, Roy  Orbison, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. Dave Hoekstra, a writer for the  Chicago Sun Times who has reviewed many Farm Aid concerts,  translates the energy and passion of the more than 300 artists  who played on the Farm Aid stage into compelling and insightful  interviews. </p>
<p>   The combined voices of performers, farmers and activists call  attention to the family farmers who produce our food, urging  Americans to seek out food from family farms.  &quot;This holiday  season, as families and friends gather to enjoy meals around the  common table, this book will deepen our appreciation for family  farmers. Food grown with the most care, close to home, from a  family farm tastes better, is fresher, and satisfies us deeply in  ways we might not be able to put into words,&quot; said Carolyn Mugar,  executive director of Farm Aid. </p>
<p>   FARM AID: A SONG FOR AMERICA brings readers on a memorable,  20-year &quot;road trip,&quot; introducing them to family farmers across  the country and to the many artists who have committed to seeing  a future of family farm food. Essays by such diverse writers as  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Barbara Kingsolver, Eric Schlosser,  Wendell Berry, Howard Zinn, Michael Pollan, and Ruth Reichl are  interwoven with hundreds of exclusive photographs and inspiring  imagery to create a tapestry that chronicles the mission,  achievements, and ongoing challenges of Farm Aid and the family  farms they help. </p>
<p>   The mid 1980s saw the emergence of concerts-for-a-cause, Band  Aid, Live Aid, &quot;We Are the World,&quot; and Farm Aid, which paved the  way for dozens of other fund-raising concerts representing a wide  range of social issues.  It was Bob Dylan's comment at Live Aid  that sparked an idea in Willie Nelson that created Farm Aid as a  concert, a community, and ultimately a movement.  Farm Aid was  the only event to gather momentum to become an enduring force for  change that has spanned two decades. Fueled by the combined  voices of performers, farmers and activists, Farm Aid's heartfelt  chorus calls attention to the critical importance of where, how,  and by whom our food is produced. It urges Americans to seek out  food from family farms. As a result of this call to action, the  demand for family farm-identified food has increased, but  unfortunately, the United States continues to lose more than 300  family farms every week. </p>

<p>   Farm Aid has raised more than $28 million to promote a strong  and resilient family farm system of agriculture and continues to  develop its grassroots network and to launch important new  initiatives.  As Neil Young is quoted in FARM AID: A SONG FOR  AMERICA, &quot;We'll be back next year.  And the year after that.   We're not giving up.&quot; </p>
