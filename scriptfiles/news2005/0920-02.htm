<p>BARENTS SEA - September 20 - Greenpeace today confronted another 
unregulated bottom trawler, the 'Kerguelen', and prevented her from 
setting her nets in the international section of the Barents Sea, known 
as the 'Loophole'.

<p>The trawler's captain admitted to Greenpeace that he was knowingly 
bottom trawling for deep sea fish with no legal quota and therefore 
engaged in illegal, unregistered and unreported (IUU) fishing, also 
known as pirate fishing. Activists from the Greenpeace ship 'Esperanza' 
used inflatable boats to interrupt the destructive fishing activities of 
the 'Kerguelen', and placed a banner on her hull branding her as a 
pirate vessel.

<p>Pirate fishing is exacerbating the problem of overfishing, which is the 
greatest threat to the sustainablility of marine biodiversity and global 
fisheries. Both issues need to be addressed urgently at the highest 
international level.

<p>"The 'Kerguelen' is already blacklisted as a known pirate vessel by the 
European Commission. Our discovery of her fishing illegally again today 
in the Barents Sea illustrates the total lack of control over fishing in 
international waters. We will give this information to the Commission 
along with the demand that she be arrested if she enters a European port 
to land her catch," said Brad Smith, Greenpeace Nordic campaigner 
onboard the 'Esperanza'.

<p>The French-owned 86m long 'Kerguelen', currently flagged in Togo, is 
believed to have been fishing under several different flags of 
convenience in recent months. Both the North-East Atlantic Fisheries 
Commission (NEAFC) and the European Commission have placed the Kerguelen 
on a list of vessels that have been confirmed as having engaged in IUU 
fisheries. However, the authorities in the EU countries where illegally 
caught fish is landed have no legal obligation to seize cargoes or 
arrest the vessels involved, even if information and evidence of illegal 
activities is provided to them by policing states.

<p>Greenpeace is calling for an immediate UN moratorium on high seas bottom 
trawling to stop the indiscriminate destruction of deep-sea life. It is 
also calling on the international community to urgently develop legally 
binding, international agreements that strengthen enforcement measures 
to stop IUU fishing. Key among these is the need for a common inspection 
regime in ports receiving fish. This would enable local authorities to 
arrest and seize catches and vessels in cases of documented 
illegalities. The true owners of such vessels must also be brought to 
account.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force the solutions, which are essential to a green and 
peaceful future.
