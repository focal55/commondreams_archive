<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 15 --  In a unique effort to shine light on corporate America's vast influence on the political process, Common Cause is teaming with a new ally to urge Fortune 500 companies to voluntarily disclose all their political contributions. To support this work, Common Cause today is also releasing a new report examining the importance of the mutual fund industry to this effort, and its reluctance so far to embrace it.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause and the Center for Political Accountability will ask corporate giants such as General Electric to publicly detail their corporate political giving and a rationale for each contribution. The Center, a non-partisan organization working for greater transparency in corporate political giving, has coordinated the filing of shareholder resolutions at 33 major Fortune 500 companies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause is urging investors, specifically large mutual fund companies, to support these resolutions at 2005 annual shareholder meetings. The support of mutual fund companies is key to this effort, as they own more than 22 percent of U.S. corporate stocks. And since nearly 50 percent of all U.S. households own mutual funds, shareholders have a stake in the matter as well.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Everyone benefits, the public and shareholders, when corporations make their political contributions transparent,&quot; said Common Cause President Chellie Pingree. &quot;It's time for mutual fund companies -- which represent the investments of millions of Americans -- to wake up and support this very basic disclosure.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, &quot;Mutual Protection: Why the Mutual Fund Industry Should Embrace Disclosure of Political Contributions,&quot; covers the following:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- How both the public and shareholders benefit when corporate contributions are made transparently.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Efforts underway to encourage companies to do a better job of disclosing political contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A Common Cause survey last year of the 10 biggest mutual fund corporations found that all voted against or abstained from voting on the shareholder resolutions requesting improved disclosure of political contributions, revealing a systemic reluctance to use shareholder clout to obtain better disclosure.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The equity ownership of these 10 largest mutual fund companies could have translated into influence. Had the 10 mutual fund companies supported the resolution, the vote for the resolution would have topped 25 percent at almost half of the companies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Future mutual fund support for shareholder resolutions requesting disclosure of political contributions could have a strong impact. The top 30 mutual fund companies own on average about 20 percent of the outstanding shares of each of the Fortune 500 companies that will face shareholder resolutions requesting disclosure this year.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Millions of Americans invest in mutual funds for their retirement or savings and therefore have a stake in urging more disclosure. As of 2004, nearly 54 million households -- more than 48 percent of all U.S. households -- invested in mutual funds.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause will take the following actions:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Urge its nearly 300,000 members and supporters who own stock on these major corporations to vote for these shareholder resolutions in the 2005 proxy season.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Urge mutual fund investors to contact fund CEOs to ask that their funds cast proxies for the Center's political contribution disclosure resolutions of 2005.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Write letters to the CEOs of the 30 major mutual fund families requesting that these fund families support shareholder resolutions that ask for disclosure of political contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We want our members to say to their mutual funds, 'Are you going to support this important disclosure, or are you going to continue to be silent?'&quot; Pingree said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause has long been concerned about the corrupting influence of corporate money in the electoral and legislative processes. The organization spearheaded efforts in 2002 to pass the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002, which banned soft money to political parties on the federal level.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is attached, or can be viewed by clicking here: <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/atf/cf/1/2FB3C17E2-CDD1-4DF6-92BE-BD44298936653/4/MUTUAL%20FUND%20REPORT%202-15-05.PDF" target="_new"><br>http://www.commoncause.org/atf/cf/1/2FB3C17E2-CDD1-4D<br>F6-92BE-BD44298936653/4/MUTUAL%20FUND%20REPORT%202-15-05.PDF</a><br></font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
