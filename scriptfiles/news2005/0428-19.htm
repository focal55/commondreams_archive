<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 28 -- Today, in response to Rush Limbaugh's statement that &quot;the religious left in this country hates and despises the God of Christianity and Catholicism,&quot; the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, president of The Interfaith Alliance, released the following<br>statement:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All people of faith in the most religiously diverse nation on earth should be insulted by the uninformed religious pronouncements of a vitriolic radio host,&quot; said Rev. Dr. C Welton Gaddy, President of the Interfaith Alliance. &quot;Mr. Limbaugh has repeatedly demonstrated his ignorance and insensitivity to the religious communities in this nation. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. Limbaugh demeans the very spirit of Christianity as well as the faithful Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, Hindu, Baha'i, and other religious communities. Unfortunately Mr. Limbaugh's words echo the recent misuse of religion by politicians. We remain gravely concerned about the continuing manipulation of religion for partisan political purposes. The fusion of partisan politics and religion arrogantly blasphemes religion and aggressively threatens the vitality of democracy. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Interfaith Alliance remains committed to the healing role of religion in America and stands with all people of faith and good will who remain dedicated to common values that enhance our lives together.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Media Matters, on the April 27 edition of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Mr. Limbaugh said:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LIMBAUGH: &quot;I would submit to you that people on the left are religious, too. Their God is just different. The left has a different God. There's a religious left in this country. <br>&quot;And, the religious left in this country hates and despises the God of Christianity and Catholicism and whatever else. They despise it because they fear it, because it's a threat, because that God has moral absolutes. That God has right and wrong, that God doesn't deal in nuance, that God doesn't deal in gray area, that God says, 'This is right and that is wrong.'&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Item: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200504280002%20" target="_new">http://mediamatters.org/items/200504280002 </a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Audio: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/static/audio/limbaugh-200504280001.mp3" target="_new">http://mediamatters.org/static/audio/limbaugh-200504280001.mp3</a> </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Gaddy is available for comment and interviews on this or other issues relating to the intersection of religion and politics.<br>Contact: Don Parker, 202.639.6370 ext. 111. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a nonpartisan, grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote a narrow, divisive agenda.
