<p>WASHINGTON — In an effort to defeat a third attempt at repealing Maine’s non-discrimination law, the Human Rights Campaign has been providing on-the-ground staff support, fundraising assistance, volunteer recruitment and direct financial contributions.

<p>“The November 8 election is about defeating extremists’ efforts to write discrimination into Maine law. These extremists will try to muddy the waters but the Human Rights Campaign and Maine Won’t Discriminate will be there every step of the way making sure voters know this is an issue of fairness,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “We are proud to partner with Maine Won’t Discriminate to ensure important protections for all Mainers go into effect and Proposition 1 is defeated.”
<p>HRC has been working with Maine Won’t Discriminate since the spring, when the law was first passed. By Election Day, more than 25 HRC staff members will have traveled to Maine to work directly with the campaign. In addition, HRC has made approximately $150,000 in direct cash contributions to Maine Won’t Discriminate.

<p>“The Human Rights Campaign has been a steadfast partner in the fight to protect GLBT Mainers,” said Jesse Connolly, campaign manager for Maine Won’t Discriminate. “One of our greatest strengths is the depth and breadth of our coalition that includes Independents, Democrats and Republicans; religious leaders including the Council of Churches and Christians for Justice; business leaders such as the Chamber of Commerce; and most of our elected representatives.”
<p>The sexual orientation and gender identity inclusive non-discrimination bill passed both houses of the Maine Legislature in March of 2005 with strong bipartisan margins and was signed into law by Gov. John Baldacci.
