<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SAN FRANCISCO - July 25 - Goodwill Industries of San Francisco and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) today introduced the San Francisco Bay Area Computer Recycling Project, the most comprehensive computer recovery, reuse and environmentally responsible recycling opportunity for residents of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pilot program offers drop-off recycling and reuse options for unwanted computers at no charge to area residents. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public-private partnership utilizes the donations infrastructure of a nonprofit, the outreach infrastructure of local governments and the experience and recycling resources of a technology company to offer a proactive, community-based solution to environmentally responsible computer disposal. The goal of this partnership is to divert at least one million pounds of used computers and computer equipment from landfills over one year and to provide education on the importance of proper computer disposal. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beginning today, residents in the three-county area will be able to call toll-free, 1-888-4-GOODWILL or 1-866-48 REUSE (73873), or visit www.computerrecyclingproject.com /sanfranciscobayarea, to learn about drop-off options for their unwanted computers and computer equipment at any of 14 convenient Goodwill locations participating. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;San Franciscans are both technology-savvy and environmentally-conscious, so this public-private program makes great sense,&quot; said San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. &quot;This effort will help create shared solutions to the problems of e-waste and make our community a safer, healthier place to live. As a City, we are proud to support this partnership between Goodwill and Dell.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodwill Industries of Central Texas partnered with Dell and the City of Austin, Texas, nine months ago to launch a similar pilot. Its success prompted Dell and Goodwill to implement a version of the program in the San Francisco Bay area. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodwill Industries of San Francisco will accept donated, residential computer equipment. The unwanted computers will be collected by Goodwill. Materials with remaining value will be separated and enter Dell's Asset Recovery Services value-recovery processes. Proceeds from equipment recovery will be returned to Goodwill Industries of San Francisco for re-investment in a variety of job-creation and community programs. Materials without resale value will be recycled. Responsible recycling will be handled by Electronic Partners Corporation (ePC) under stringent Dell guidelines. ePC is a part of Chasm Industries, a firm that specializes in electronic asset management and recycling services. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Residents are responsible for removing their data from hard drives and other storage media before collection. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The project team surveyed San Francisco Bay Area consumers to test awareness and preferences for computer disposal. Survey results show preferred methods for disposal are donation to charity (71 percent of <br>respondents) and permanent drop-off locations (68 percent). This project will offer area consumers the convenience of drop-off and the ability to support a local charity with used computers. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an exciting opportunity for Goodwill to partner with Dell and public entities such as San Francisco and San Mateo Counties. We are thrilled to launch this innovative business that will drastically reduce the amount of waste going to landfill while generating new jobs and contributing to a sustainable environment,&quot; said Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez, CEO and President of Goodwill Industries of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin Counties. &quot;This computer recycling and reuse program builds on Goodwill's longstanding commitment to running one of the largest waste-diversion programs in San Francisco. We try to find ways to reuse as many things as possible, either directly or by working with responsible partners.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dell partners with government, industry and citizen-based organizations to find ways to improve environmental performance and share knowledge. This pilot program is the latest in a series of Dell environmental initiatives to increase recycling participation rates and consumer awareness of the need to responsibly recycle computers. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Dell remains committed to making computer recycling easy and affordable for consumers and increasing recovery of used computers. <br>Dell's continued focus on operational efficiency will help this pilot meet those objectives,&quot; said Ken Hashman, vice president of Dell's Deployment and Field Services. &quot;This pilot is designed to be scalable and we're confident it will eventually serve as a model other communities may voluntarily adopt.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At an event at the Goodwill Industries headquarters, executives from the partner organizations met with San Francisco Bay Area government and community leaders to discuss how this pilot donation project will keep computers out of landfills while helping to provide funding for community programming. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About Goodwill Industries of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin Counties </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodwill Industries of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin Counties Inc., a private, nonprofit, 501(c)3 organization, is the premiere powerhouse of workforce creation and community sustainability in the Bay Area. A social enterprise committed to &quot;doing good and doing well,&quot; Goodwill is leading the charge toward a holistic model for community development by supporting the transformation of individuals into skilled, career-building workers. Simultaneously Goodwill is striving to make a positive and enduring impact on the community through the creative re-use of products and by advocating for policies and business practices that promote a sustainable environment. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodwill has also partnered with the County of San Mateo to establish a three-county hub for the processing of the donated computers, employing clients in the San Mateo County Vocational Rehabilitation Services program.
