SAN FRANCISCO - Tides Shared Spaces,  a program of the Tides network of nonprofit organizations, today  announced that it has successfully purchased 40,000 square feet  of office space located at 15 Broad Street in Lower Manhattan.  The office space will house Thoreau Center New York, a multi- tenant nonprofit center that will provide quality work and  program space for New York City nonprofit and cultural  organizations. Tides Shared Spaces, the Tides initiative that  creates, operates and promotes sustainable workspace for  nonprofits, conceived and developed the real estate project and  will operate the space.</p>
<p>   Thoreau Center New York will provide stable rental rates for  nonprofits, as well as conference center facilities and  opportunities for tenant collaboration and sharing. Some office  space has already been leased and remaining spaces in the highly  desirable location are expected to go quickly. Thoreau Center New  York's design will use a "green" environmentally sustainable  architectural plan, incorporating elements such as sustainably  harvested wood, recycled building materials, non-toxic paints and  energy efficient mechanical systems. After renovation, the space  will be open to tenants and the community in summer 2006.</p>
<p>   "In order for nonprofits to continue their important  contributions to society, they need stable, program enhancing  space," said China Brotsky, Vice President, Tides leading the  Tides Shared Spaces program. "With the creation of Thoreau Center  New York, Tides Shared Spaces is continuing its mission to create  multi-tenant nonprofit centers. New York nonprofits now have an  opportunity to lease quality space in an important area where  nonprofits are often priced out of the rental market."</p>
<p>   Bridge funding for Thoreau Center New York was provided by  Wells Fargo Bank with long-term financing planned using tax  exempt bonds issued by New York City Industrial Development  Agency (IDA). Subsequent program-related investments are expected  from supportive philanthropic sources.</p>
<p>   "This project is the latest example of the diversification of  the Lower Manhattan economy and the changes taking place  downtown," said Steven Berzin, New York City Industrial  Development Agency (IDA), Executive Director. "Lower Manhattan is  increasingly becoming home to companies outside the financial  services sector, thereby broadening our economic base. With the  forward thinking help of Tides, Thoreau Center New York  exemplifies the kinds of initiatives that will preserve and  expand not-for-profit occupancy in the financial district."</p>
<p>   Thoreau Center New York is part of a larger nonprofit center  which will occupy one third of the base of the 15 Broad Street  building. A separate dedicated entrance at the Exchange Place  side of the building has been secured - 55 Exchange Place - for  the center. Lower Manhattan, the historic downtown center of New  York City, is the third largest central business district in the  country. The nonprofit center will greatly increase the nonprofit  sector presence in this area which is a hub of global finance,  the center of New York City's government, and the home of many  educational, historical and cultural institutions and museums.</p>
<p>   "A single nonprofit does not have the sufficient size to  compete against other buyers or developers that purchase  affordable New York City space on a wholesale basis. Tides was  the catalyst that brought the vision and built the consensus  among various nonprofits to create this center. This is one of  the most creative transactions of the year," said Marjorie  Torres, Chief Executive Officer of Concrete Stories, the real  estate advisory firm that provided key strategic advice,  specialized nonprofit brokerage and property development services  for the project.</p>
<p>   With the new center, Tides Shared Spaces expects to create the  same success as with the Thoreau Center for Sustainability in San  Francisco, a thriving multi-tenant nonprofit center with 12  buildings housing over 60 organizations working for social and  environmental sustainability. Thoreau Center for Sustainability  supports the community through a program of educational events,  and informational and art gallery exhibits. It has also  incorporated green design and historic preservation.</p>
