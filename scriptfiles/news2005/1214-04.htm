<p>WASHINGTON - December 14 - The awardees are:

<p>	Bunnatine "Bunny" Greenhouse, who was the top civilian contracting 
officer in the Army Corps of Engineers. Because she took her duties 
seriously, she has been demoted. Greenhouse had objected vociferously 
within the Army Corps to the sweetheart, no-bid, sole-source, five-year 
contract potentially worth $7 billion awarded to Halliburton/KBR to do 
repairs on oil fields in Iraq. She pointed out that KBR had secretly 
been hired months earlier to draw up parameters for the contract.
	
<p>	U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Sharon Shaffer and U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Charles 
D. Swift are military lawyers who found themselves tasked with the duty 
of defending prisoners labeled terrorists by the U.S. government and 
imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. Shaffer represents Ibrahim al-Qosi, a 
Sudanese accountant accused of being an al-Qaeda member and helping 
handle finances for al-Qaeda. Swift represents Salim Hamdan, a Yemeni 
and one of Osama bin Laden's former drivers, accused of being an 
al-Qaeda member and charged with plotting to attack American civilians. 
Shaffer and Swift say their clients are innocent of the charges against 
them -- but they insist that their clients cannot get a fair hearing or 
treatment under procedures now afforded to Guatanamo Bay prisoners.

<p>	The awards will be presented on Thursday, December 15, 2005 at 5:00 
p.m. at the Carnegie Institution Building, 1530 P Street NW, Washington, 
D.C.  Following each award the recipients will speak briefly about their 
work.

<p>	The Shafeek Nader Trust for the Community Interest administers the Joe 
A. Callaway Award, established by Mr. Callaway to recognize individuals 
in any area of endeavor who, with integrity and at some personal risk, 
take a public stand to advance truth and justice, and who challenge 
unsatisfactory conditions in pursuit of the common good. Toward this 
end, Mr. Callaway endowed the Trust with a special fund for an annual 
award honoring citizens for their civic courage.

	<p>The Shafeek Nader Trust for the Community Interest was created to 
extend the civic values of the late Shafeek Nader, community advocate 
and founder of the Northwestern Connecticut Community College. A 
tax-exempt organization, the Trust has the task of advancing the ability 
of citizens to participate and shape the quality of democracy in their 
community.
