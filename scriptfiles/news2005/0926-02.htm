<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VIENNA, Austria <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->- September 26 - At the opening of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Annual General Meeting today, Greenpeace 
denounced the role of the Atomic Agency in promoting nuclear power and 
thereby aiding the spread of nuclear weapons. Greenpeace calls on the 
world's governments to engage in a diplomatic process in the Middle 
East, instead of escalating the confrontation with Iran.

<p>Forty activists attached a banner in front of the UN building in Vienna 
with the text: 'IAEA = NUCLEAR POWER = NUCLEAR BOMBS'. A flying 6-metre 
long nuclear bomb with 'IAEA' on it flew above the IAEA venue and a 
nuclear missile with 'NUCLEAR POWER = NUCLEAR BOMBS' was deployed in 
front of the entrance. 

<p>"Nuclear power is not only dirty, dangerous and economically insane, it 
also generates the very materials that can be used for nuclear bombs," 
said Jan Vande Putte of Greenpeace.

<p>Even the Director General of the IAEA Dr. ElBaradei recognises that 
35-40 countries with nuclear power are capable of developing a nuclear 
weapon within a few months (1).  

<p>The only solution to the current security and proliferation concerns in 
the Middle East is through the creation of a Nuclear Free Zone, a 
diplomatic process that will eliminate all weapons and nuclear 
technology in the region, and the rapid development of renewable 
energy.  If the current crisis is to be resolved, the 'Nuclear Free 
Zone' in the Middle East, must include the abandonment of so-called 
'civil' nuclear programmes because nuclear power equals nuclear bombs.

<p>"Fifty years of promoting nuclear technology by the IAEA has only 
exacerbated the problem of nuclear proliferation. This promotional role 
is highly irresponsible and must be stopped.  The IAEA should focus on 
its urgently relevant task of controlling and safeguarding, to the 
extent possible, the highly dangerous nuclear materials and technology 
in circulation," continued Vande Putte.

<p>Greenpeace therefore calls for the scrapping of the IAEA's promotional 
function as part of the  UN reform process underway, to heal it from its 
topical schizophrenia and to enable it to become a true nuclear watchdog.

<p>The UN should promote renewable energy technologies which are peaceful, 
generate employment and prosperity to local communities and respect the 
environment. Wind energy in Europe is growing by more than 6,000 MW 
every year, the equivalent of 2-3 large nuclear reactors, while it takes 
the nuclear industry nearly 10 years to build one single reactor.

<p>"The IAEA can only become a real nuclear watchdog if it stops feeding 
the very dragon it is supposed to be starving," added Vande Putte. "The 
IAEA should promote the phase-out of a dangerous and polluting 
technology which has been bypassed by a booming renewable energy industry."

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
