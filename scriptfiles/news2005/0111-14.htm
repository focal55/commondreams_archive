Our current fire policies are wasting taxpayer dollars, damaging natural resources, and putting firefighters&#146; lives at unnecessary risk. FUSEE is firefighters standing up and speaking out for the highest possible safety standards.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fox, a veteran Forest Service smokejumper and FUSEE board member, said the new organization of wildland firefighters &#147;stands for a new ethos that links improvement in firefighter and community safety with ecological restoration of public lands and ethical use of taxpayer dollars and resources.&#148; &#147;Firefighters who work on the frontlines and see the need for changes in policy sometimes face retaliation and reprisals in their workplaces if they speak out,&#148; said Fox. &#147;There is an urgent need for this organization to help get practical information to reporters, the public and policymakers.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>FUSEE (pronounced FEW-zee) is a national nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that is dedicated to uniting wildland firefighters to promote safe, ethical, and ecological fire management. FUSEE is an affiliate of PEER, or Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of FUSEE include current and former wildland firefighters, other fire professionals, rural homeowners, and other citizens supportive of the group&#146;s mission and activities. A &#147;fusee&#148; is a quick-igniting, handheld torch used by firefighters to secure firelines, create safety zones, reduce hazardous fuel loads, and restore fire-adapted ecosystems. </font></i></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Timothy Ingalsbee, Ph.D. is the executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology (FUSEE), and is a former wildland firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service. Ingalsbee is a nationally recognized writer and speaker on wildland fire ecology and management issues that link firefighter safety with community protection and ecological restoration. Ingalsbee directed the Western Fire Ecology Center for the American Lands Alliance from 1997 to 2004. </i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>In 2002, Ingalsbee was appointed by Oregon Governor Kitzhaber to serve on the Western Governors' Association's collaborative stakeholder group that developed the Implementation Plan and Performance Measures for the Ten-Year Comprehensive Strategy and National Fire Plan. He currently serves on the Western Governor&#146;s Association&#146;s Forest Health Advisory Committee. In 2003, Ingalsbee was elected to secretary of the board of directors for the nonprofit Association for Fire Ecology.
