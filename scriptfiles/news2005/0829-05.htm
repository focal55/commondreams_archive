<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON -- For some time, the  central mystery in the Valerie Plame saga was which members of  the White House staff leaked the undercover CIA operative's  identity to reporters. Although there are still many unanswered  questions, at least part of the mystery has been solved: Time  magazine correspondent Matthew Cooper has testified that he was  told about Plame by White House senior adviser Karl Rove and I.  Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of  staff. Yet while Cooper and his editors at Time spent two years  keeping Rove and Libby's -- and their own -- role a secret, they  published articles that reported, without challenge, a statement  from the White House that they knew to be false.<p>   The issue of Time's actions over the past two years was  revived by an August 25 Los Angeles Times article stating that  the magazine did not pursue a waiver from Rove allowing Cooper to  testify in part because &quot;Time editors were concerned about  becoming part of such an explosive story in an election year.&quot;  While the favor this &quot;concern&quot; did for the Bush re-election  effort has been criticized, Time's lack of disclosure about its  own role in the affair has gone largely unnoticed.</p><p>   As the Los Angeles Times laid out the chronology, the details  of which became publicly known only earlier this summer, on July  11, 2003, Rove told Cooper that the wife of former ambassador  Joseph C. Wilson IV worked for the CIA and had a role in sending  Wilson on a 2002 mission to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq  had attempted to purchase uranium there. After speaking to Rove,  Cooper sent an email to Michael Duffy, Time's Washington bureau  chief, relating what Rove had told him about Wilson's wife and  saying that Rove had spoken on &quot;double super secret background.&quot;  The next day, Cooper spoke to Libby, who confirmed Plame's  identity. Two days later, Robert D. Novak's infamous column  revealing Plame's identity appeared.</p><p>   Yet on October 13, 2003, three months after receiving the leak  from Rove and Libby, Duffy -- the very person to whom Cooper had  passed on the information concerning Wilson's wife and the source  who gave that information to him -- wrote an article for Time on  the subject. In the article, to which Cooper contributed  reporting, was this passage:</p><p>   When word spread last week that the Department of Justice  (DOJ) was launching a full criminal probe into who had leaked  Plame's identity, Democrats immediately raised a public alarm:  How could Justice credibly investigate so secretive an  Administration, especially when the investigators are led by  Attorney General John Ashcroft, whose former paid political  consultant Karl Rove was initially accused by Wilson of being the  man behind the leak? A TIME review of federal and state election  records reveals that Ashcroft paid Rove's Texas firm $746,000 for  direct-mail services in two gubernatorial campaigns and one  Senate race from 1984 through 1994. White House spokesman Scott  McClellan said accusations of Rove's peddling information are  &quot;ridiculous.&quot; Says McClellan: &quot;There is simply no truth to that  suggestion.&quot;</p><p>   Duffy wrote that Rove was &quot;initially&quot; accused by Wilson of  being the man behind the leak, as though Wilson was no longer  making that accusation or that the accusation was found to be  without merit. In fact, Wilson did not back down from the charge,  although he did allow that he had no proof of Rove's involvement.  For instance, appearing on the September 29, 2003, edition of  CNN's Paula Zahn Now, Wilson said, &quot;I don't have any specific  information. I would hope that an investigation would yield the  information as to who was responsible for the precise leak. What  I do have are any number of journalist sources, none of whom I  have any reason not to believe, who have said that the White  House was pushing this story after the leak, after the Novak  article, and including Karl Rove.&quot;</p><p>   Of course, it turned out that Wilson's charge was correct, as  Cooper and his editors knew all along. Despite that knowledge,  Time printed a quote from McClellan that they knew to be false  without offering any refutation.</p><p>   Duffy, Cooper, and Time not only failed to inform their  readers in July 2003 that they were part of the story, but they  continued to report on the leak without offering that information  for more than a year. In addition to two stories in October 2003,  Time wrote about the leak again on January 12, 2004. It was not  until August 2004, when Cooper was held in contempt by the grand  jury investigating the Plame leak, that it was revealed that  Cooper was involved in the Plame affair.</p><p>   <i>Media Matters for America is a Web-based, not-for-profit,  progressive research and information center dedicated to  comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting  conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.
