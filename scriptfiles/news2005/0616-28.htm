himself as "a very close friend to" the campaign of Mostafa Moin, the 
reformist presidential candidate in Iran. Davoodi said today: "In an 
'adsphere' [where] most of the presidential candidates in Iran introduce 
themselves as a very helpful technocrat and sell themselves as a democrat, 
I think Dr. [Mostafa] Moin is the only candidate that is close to a liberal 
movement in Iran. However I think that he is not all the things that the 
young generation in Iran is looking for. We demand more and more reforms 
and freedom -- a big change in the political power structure."

      <br>Solomon is executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy 
and author of the new book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471694797/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep 
Spinning Us to Death</a>." He is currently in Tehran, where he has been 
interviewing a wide range of Iranian people. Solomon wrote in an article 
this week: "Iran's most repressive clerics and the USA's most militaristic 
neocons share a common interest: They're very eager to see the failure of 
Iranian activism for democracy and human rights. ... [T]he hardliners in 
both countries need each other. Theirs is a perverse, mutual dependency 
that dares not speak its name. ... The Moin [presidential] campaign drew 
10,000 people to a rally at a Tehran stadium Tuesday night. A number of 
speakers emphasized that the campaign is aiming to lay groundwork for a 
movement -- and this election is just the beginning. ... The Tehran Times 
reported Wednesday [that] the outspoken Moin 'referred to the upcoming 
establishment of a Democracy and Human Rights Front in Iran to defend the 
rights of all Iran's religious and ethnic groups, the youth, academicians, 
women, and political opposition groups whose rights are often neglected.' 
... In a country where political imprisonment and torture continue, such 
public statements are emblematic of a courageous movement struggling to 
emerge from the shadows of the Islamic Republic. Progress for that movement 
is a nightmare for theocrats and neocons who share deep commitments to 
violence and fear." </font><p></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="CENTER"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
