<p>TRENTON, New Jersey - November 30 - The Executive Commission on 
            Ethical Standards has dismissed without explanation a complaint that 
            New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner 
            Bradley Campbell improperly gave confidential deliberative 
            regulatory information to developer Joe Riggs, President of K. 
            Hovnanian. As a consequence, there will be no sanction against 
            Campbell for providing developers extremely valuable inside 
            information about agency plans well before they were made public. 
            </P>
            <P>The request for ethics review was filed on July 5, 2005 by Public 
            Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) concerning 
            politically connected developers getting the inside track on stream 
            classification decisions worth millions of dollars. On October 18, 
            2005, PEER expanded its initial ethics complaint based on 
            Commissioner Campbell&#8217;s own remarks in press accounts, in which he 
            admitted that he had used his regulatory powers to reward 
            legislators and &#8220;drum up bipartisan support&#8221; despite the fact that, 
            according to state regulations, these regulatory decisions are 
            required to be based on science and water quality, not political 
            considerations.</P>
            <P>The Executive Commission on Ethical Standards is the state entity 
            charged with enforcing New Jersey&#8217;s ethics laws. The ECES is 
            composed primarily of Cabinet members of Acting Governor Richard 
            Codey, including DEP Commissioner Bradley Campbell (who did not 
            participate in this decision). </P>
            <P>The ECES dismissed the PEER request based upon staff 
            recommendation. However, the staff investigator&#8217;s factual findings 
            and recommendations were not disclosed, nor were they publicly 
            discussed by the Commission, prior to introducing a resolution and 
            voting to dismiss the matter. The ECES did not allow any public 
            testimony or comment, before or after, their decision to dismiss the 
            matter, as has not done so for 20 years, according to an email from 
            ECES Executive Director, Rita Strmensky.<BR><BR>&#8220;No wonder New 
            Jersey remains synonymous with political corruption; the state 
            ethics watchdog is made of political appointees who do not hear 
            evidence or explain their decisions,&#8221; stated New Jersey PEER 
            Director Bill Wolfe, noting that Acting Governor Codey&#8217;s order for 
            &#8220;sweeping&#8221; ethics reform this past May appears to have had no 
            effect. &#8220;If sunlight is the best disinfectant, then someone needs to 
            pull the blinds wide open on this ethics commission.&#8221;</P>
            <P>The dismissal by ECES appears to approve the practice by state 
            officials of manipulating environmental regulations to reward 
            political campaign contributors and for overtly partisan political 
            reasons. As &#8220;PoliticsNJ.com,&#8221; the state&#8217;s premier political website 
            points out, quoting lobbyist Alan Marcus &#8211;</P>

              <P>&#8220;In New Jersey, you contribute money not for access but 
              results. Anybody who doesn't admit that is lying." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>&#8220;Despite promises to reform the Trenton ethical climate, 
            pay-to-play and politics as usual are alive and well in New Jersey,&#8221; 
            concluded Wolfe.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
