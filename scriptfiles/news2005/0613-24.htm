<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, DC&#151;As of today, over 10,000 workers in America have been fired or discriminated against for demonstrating support for a union.  In an effort to raise awareness about this crisis, American Rights at Work released a short Flash video today, titled &quot;10,000 Workers,&quot; as the centerpiece of a new e-advocacy campaign designed to build support for labor law reform.  To view the video, click here: <a href="http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/efcaflash.cfm" target="_new">http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/efcaflash.cfm</a></font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This isn't happening to strangers,&quot; says David Bonior, the former Michigan congressman who now chairs the board of the nonprofit workers' rights advocacy group. &quot;These are our nurses, school bus drivers, and favorite grocery store clerks. Our new campaign will put a face on this crisis.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tracking the federal government's own data, American Rights at Work found that an average of over 23,000 men and women are fired or discriminated against annually for exercising their legal rights to form or join a union.  Last December the group launched a &quot;workers' rights violations ticker&quot; on its website to count in real time the number of workers whose democratic rights are violated each year; that ticker will pass the 10,000 mark today.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Every 23 minutes a worker suffers retaliation just because they supported a union at work,&quot; says Mary Beth Maxwell, Executive Director of American Rights at Work. &quot;America's workers deserve better and it's time for Congress to enact meaningful reform to protect their rights.&quot; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Rights at Work supports the Employee Free Choice Act (H.R. 1696 and S. 842) as a critical first step in stemming the tide of workers' rights violations.  The bill, introduced in Congress this year by Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Representatives Peter King (R-NY) and George Miller (D-CA), strengthens protections for workers during union representation drives, toughens penalties for employers who violate workers' rights, and offers mediation so that employers and unions reach contracts within a reasonable period of time. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;10,000 Workers&quot; features an animated photo montage of dozens of workers' faces, after which several brief screens of text appears explaining problems workers face when they support a union at work.  The end of the video prompts viewers to send a message to their representatives in support of the Employee Free Choice Act.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Through our campaign, we're offering people a meaningful way to take action and protect democracy in the American workplace,&quot; says Bonior.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Rights at Work is a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to educating the American public about the barriers that workers face when they attempt to exercise their rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining. Our mission is to fight for a nation where the freedom of workers to organize unions and bargain collectively with employers is restored, guaranteed and promoted.</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
