<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GAINESVILLE, FL -- March 31  -- As Florida Governor Jeb Bush mourns the passing of Terri Schiavo in the wake of his personal and extraordinary efforts to keep her alive, the clock is ticking on another Floridian who is about to receive a state-assisted suicide. As the final chapter of the Schiavo saga was heating up a month ago, Bush signed a death warrant for Glen J. Ocha. Ocha, who has legally changed his name to Raven Raven, is a suicidal and mentally ill man who waived his appeals and is scheduled for execution at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, April 5, 2005 in revenge for his murder of Carol Skjerva.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I still firmly believe that human life is a gift and a mystery, and that its mystery is most evident at its beginning and ending. May all of us whose hearts were moved during the life of Terri Schiavo grow in wisdom at its ending,&quot; said Governor Bush in a statement sent to the Governor's e-mail list shortly after Schiavo passed away.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I certainly hope Governor Bush has gained some wisdom about the value of life -- all life,&quot; said Abe Bonowitz, director of Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (FADP). &quot;We hope and pray that he will now adopt a consistently pro-life policy.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (FADP) calls on Governor Jeb Bush to reverse himself and stop the state-assisted suicide of Glen Ocha (pronounced &quot;O'Shea&quot;).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Glen Ocha is suicidal and demonstrably mentally ill.

So far Governor Bush has overseen the execution of 16 prisoners, seven of whom have been volunteers.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ocha committed a horrible crime and then demanded to be executed. Once again Governor Bush is playing into the hands of a convicted murderer who just wants to die. Why is it that the only way you can get an assisted suicide in this state is if you murder someone and go to death row?&quot; asked Bonowitz</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If this killing goes forward, it will be the 60th execution in Florida since 1979 and the 17th under Governor Jeb Bush.
