<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 21 -- House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Whip Steny Hoyer and other senior House Democrats today sent a letter to the Social Security Administration urging them to halt the Bush Administration's use of propaganda to push the President's plan to cut Social Security benefits.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a pattern of propaganda by the Bush Administration that must be stopped,&quot; Pelosi said. &quot;It has paid a conservative commentator to covertly promote No Child Left Behind, produced fake video news releases designed to look like real news reports, and is using Social Security Administration employees to undermine Social Security. We must probe the disturbing depths of these scandals to determine how such unethical decisions are being made. These underhanded tactics are not worthy of our great democracy. The President's commitment to freedom around the world should extend to the freedom of the American people to live without their tax dollars being used to run a government propaganda machine.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The text of the letter follows:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">January 21, 2005</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable Jo Anne B. Barnhart Commissioner Social Security Administration 6401 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD 21235-0001</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Ms. Barnhart:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is critical that the public retain confidence in the Social Security Administration (SSA) as a source of unbiased and accurate information about the Social Security program. Congress made SSA an independent agency with an Administrator whose tenure differs from Presidential terms in part to help protect both the programs you administer and the information that you provide to the public from any appearance of undue political influence. We know that you share these concerns and we appreciate your commitment to Social Security and to the sound administration of the programs you oversee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are writing about recent developments that raise concerns about a possible threat to the independence and impartiality that is so important to maintaining public confidence in Social Security and in the information provided by SSA. These developments also suggest the possibility of inappropriate White House interference with the activities of your agency.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We recently obtained a copy of the Social Security Administration's &quot;National Strategic Communications Plan for FY 2005,&quot; as well as its &quot;Communications/Marketing Tactical Plan&quot; for the Kansas City region. These documents were the subject of major articles in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times on Sunday.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documents raise serious concerns about whether federal employees are being inappropriately enlisted to promote the Bush Administration's political agenda. For example, the &quot;Communications/Marketing Tactical Plan&quot; states that agency employees should disseminate the following message to &quot;all audiences&quot;: &quot;Social Security's long-term financing problems are serious and need to be addressed soon&quot; or else Social Security may not &quot;be there for future generations.&quot; (1)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documents also raise concerns about the use of government- funded propaganda. According to the &quot;Communications/Marketing Tactical Plan,&quot; the Social Security Administration intends to &quot;place articles on solvency in external publications.&quot; The same plan indicates that the Social Security Administration intends to use the &quot;mediums&quot; of &quot;(r)adio, TV, newspapers,&quot; as well as &quot;(e)mployer and special interest publications,&quot; to spread the message that &quot;the sooner changes are made, the more time people will have to adjust.&quot; The plan also directs the agency to &quot;(l)ook for non-traditional locations to educate people about the Social Security system, such as outreach events at farmer's markets, big box retail stores, etc.&quot; (2)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under federal law, it is illegal to spend appropriated funds on publicity or propaganda. (3) This ban has been interpreted to include covert propaganda that does not reveal its source as well as propaganda with a purely partisan purpose. (4) We have concerns about whether the efforts described in these documents comply with this prohibition. For this reason, we request copies of all written communications and documents that relate to the &quot;National Strategic Communications Plan&quot; and the &quot;Communications/Marketing Tactical Plan&quot; for any region.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our request includes, but is not limited to:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- All articles placed or attempted to place in external publications;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- All materials created for radio, TV, or newspapers;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- All materials created for employer and special interest publications;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- All materials prepared for any outreach to &quot;non- traditional&quot; locations, such as farmer's markets and big box retailers;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Additional internal documents describing the goals of, and the methods used in preparing, the &quot;National Strategic Communications Plan&quot; and the &quot;Communications/Marketing Tactical Plan;&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Copies of any contracts with advertising and public relations firms associated with the implementation of the plan, including any subcontracts and modifications to those contracts; and</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Budget and staffing information for this effort.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, we request that you provide all contracts executed by the Social Security Agency during the Bush Administration with public relations firms, advertising agencies, media organizations, individual members of the media, and polling firms, including all subcontracts and any modifications of such contracts.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The enclosed documents suggest activities that would be more appropriate for White House staff than for SSA staff. We would also like to know whether any White House staff members were involved in initiating or developing the plans or whether the project was conceived and developed independently and entirely within SSA.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have enclosed copies of the &quot;National Strategic Communications Plan&quot; and the &quot;Communications/Marketing Tactical Plan&quot; for your review. We request that you provide the information we have requested by February 2, 2005.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter. We look forward to continuing to work with you in your efforts to ensure that Social Security programs are effectively managed and retain public confidence.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steny H.
