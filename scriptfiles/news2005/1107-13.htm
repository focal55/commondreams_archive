<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MANILA - November 7 - The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is responsible 
for financing climate change in Asia and its policies are contributing 
to the displacement of communities and the destruction of ecosystems in 
the region, Greenpeace said today, as activists dressed as human 
smokestacks blocked the exit gate of the ADB’s offices in Manila.

<p>“For an organization whose stated goal is to reduce poverty in the Asia 
Pacific region, the ADB’s funding polices are nothing short of grossly 
negligent,” said Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s climate spokesperson Red 
Constantino at the protest.

<p>“The ADB recognizes climate change is a reality yet in countries like 
the Philippines it hypocritically diverts less than 0.1% of its lending 
target towards renewable energy. Even more scandalous is its continued 
attempt to categorize dirty energy like coal as part of its miniscule 
renewable energy program. There is no such thing as cheap coal, and 
clean coal is a myth,” he said.

<p>Of the ADB’s entire Energy Portfolio Financing from 1966-2004, only 
1.82% went towards funding renewable energy and energy efficiency.¹ The 
overwhelming majority of financing has been geared towards fossil fuel 
power projects such as the Masinloc coal plant in the Philippines and 
Southeast Asia’s largest and most notorious coal plant in Mae Moh, 
Thailand and currently funds are being earmarked for newer plants like 
Map Ta Phut in Thailand. Since Mae Moh began operations in 1955, 30 000 
people have been displaced, almost 200 killed and thousands suffer from 
respiratory problems caused by inhalation and exposure to sulfur dioxide 
from the mine and the power station.

<p>“It is obscene that plants like these are some of the biggest climate 
change culprits and yet billions of taxpayer dollars are being used to 
finance dirty coal power projects like them across Asia,” said 
Greenpeace international’s Athena Ronquillo.

<p>According to Greenpeace, governments who have agreed to cut greenhouse 
emissions are also being hooked into the very same technologies that 
produce them through their relationships with institutions like the 
World Bank (WB), the Japanese

<p>International Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Export 
Credit Agencies (ECAs), whose priorities are locking them into an 
unsustainable coal-led growth.

<p>Clean alternatives to fossil fuel power in Asia are widely available. In 
the Philippines enough wind power potential exists to produce 7 times 
over the country’s current energy demand. In the Chinese province of 
Guangdong there exists sufficient wind power potential to meet the 
equivalent of the current energy supply in Hong Kong.²

<p>“Organizations like the ADB, along with the WB and JBIC, need to stop 
fuelling the problem of climate change and start financing cleaner, 
safer solutions. Greenpeace calls on International Financing 
Institutions to commit to a 20% renewable energy target for power 
project lending annually. They need to come clean on dirty energy,” 
concluded Ronquillo.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
