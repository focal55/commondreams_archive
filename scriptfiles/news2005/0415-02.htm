<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 15 -- &quot;This ruling reinforces the discrimination that exists in Oregon for same-sex couples,&quot; said NOW Action Vice President Olga Vives. &quot;Equality should be afforded to all people, regardless of their sexual orientation.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today the Oregon Supreme Court nullified 3,000 same-sex marriages when it ruled that <a href="http://www.now.org/issues/marriage/" target="_new">marriage</a> is limited to heterosexual couples. The court also refused to decide whether gays and lesbian couples should have the same rights and benefits as married couples. This decision follows the passage of a November 2004 amendment that defines marriage as a strictly heterosexual institution. The amendment passed by a margin of 57 percent to 43 percent.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW supports marriage rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Allowing same-sex couples to marry expands and ensures the civil liberties of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, while demonstrating a commitment to fairness and justice for all people.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We encourage the people of Oregon to continue fighting for their rights,&quot; said Vives. &quot;Although this is a setback in the struggle for fairness and equality, NOW is committed to creating a society where all individuals will be treated with dignity and equality under the law.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
