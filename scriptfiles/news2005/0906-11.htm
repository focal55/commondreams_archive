<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - September 6 - "At a time when the price of gasoline is hurting consumers at the pump, when Hurricane Katrina has reminded us how dependent we are on oil and how fragile and vulnerable our delivery system is, and the American people are looking for action and solutions, the Congressional Leadership is reacting in their usual manner - by holding hearings.

<p>"Some members of Congress have already used Hurricane Katrina - which killed untold hundreds or thousands of people to advance their narrow political agenda.  Now because Hurricane Katrina seriously affected the production, refinery capacity, and price of oil in the United States, some in Congress are trying to use it as an excuse to renew calls to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and our fragile coastlines.  Have they no shame? Are they so bankrupt of ideas?

<p>"While this may help their cronies in the auto and oil industries, it won't reduce the effect of future disruptions. They refuse to recognize that by reducing our dependence on oil, not putting up more rigs and drilling, we can save consumers money at the pumps, cut pollution and protect our special places.  Our gasoline supplies are in critical condition because of the intentional action of oil companies - like ExxonMobil - to increase market power and profits by reducing refinery capacity.  Hurricane Katrina did not cause the price of gas to go to $4 a gallon - ExxonMobil did.

<p>"The solution is making our cars, SUVs and other light trucks go farther on a gallon of gas.  Twenty-five years ago, Congress responded to an oil crisis by enacting what has proven to be the most successful energy savings measure it has ever adopted-- the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and light trucks. By requiring automakers to double the average fuel economy of cars between the late-1970s through the late-1980s, Congress ensured that the U.S. saved 3 million barrels of oil every day.

<p>"Consumers facing high prices at the pump want solutions. But the United States can never drill its way to energy independence. There is a better way.  The technology exists today to make all vehicles - from sedans, to SUVs to pickup trucks - go farther on a gallon of gas.  By using more efficient engines, smarter transmissions, and better materials automakers can make all vehicles average 40 miles per gallon within ten years.  This would save more oil than we currently import from the Persian Gulf or could ever get from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge combined.  It would also save consumer's money at the gas pump and curb the heat-trapping pollution that causes global warming. "Americans know the effects of rising gas prices - we feel them everyday in our wallets and pocket books.  We need real action, not more talk from Congressional Leaders.  And unless we demand, and create change, we will continue to be dependent on foreign oil."
