<p>WASHINGTON - December 9 - Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. — tapped by New Jersey Governor-Elect Jon Corzine to fill his Senate seat — has a strong record of fairness on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues, according to the Human Rights Campaign’s congressional scorecard.  Menendez has a congressional career rating of 91 percent on the scorecard, siding with equality and fairness in 43 out of 47 scored votes, co-sponsorships and pledges.

<p>“Representative Menendez will be an advocate for fairness in the Senate,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “We congratulate him on his appointment and look forward to working with him as a U.S. senator.”

<p>Menendez was first elected in 1992 and steadily built a record of fairness on GLBT equality.  His HRC scorecard ratings are: 108th Congress, 100 percent; 107th Congress, 100 percent; 106th Congress, 100 percent; 105th Congress, 88 percent; 104th Congress, 78 percent; 103rd Congress, 86 percent.

<p>Unfortunately, Menendez voted for the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act — a law signed by President Clinton that purports to allow states not to recognize same-sex couples married in another state, as well as block federal benefits for those unions.

<p>But last year, when right-wing extremists demanded a discriminatory amendment to the Constitution to ban marriage rights for same-sex couples, Menendez strongly spoke out against using the Constitution as a tool for discrimination.

<p>“Senator Corzine has been another tireless advocate for equality and we thank him for his steadfast support of our community,” added Solmonese.
