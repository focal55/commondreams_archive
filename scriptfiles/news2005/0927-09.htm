<p>WASHINGTON - September 27 - New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman and NBC Nightly  News anchor Brian Williams both noted that it was only in  observing government failures in the Hurricane Katrina relief  effort that journalists began seriously to challenge the  administration. NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent  Andrea Mitchell conceded that reporters have been &quot;less  challenging&quot; since the attacks. Friedman wrote that the 9-11  attacks created in the media a &quot;deference&quot; towards the  administration. Williams described the press corps as &quot;settling  in to too comfortable a journalistic pattern,&quot; a phenomenon he  described as the &quot;9/11 syndrome.&quot;
<p>   On the Sept. 23 edition of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, on  which Mitchell was a guest, host Maher referred to Mitchell's  tough questioning of Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir during a  July trip to Sudan with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's  delegation. The Sudanese leader's security guards forcibly  removed Mitchell from the press briefing after she asked about  his involvement with the ongoing atrocities there:</p>
<p>   MAHER: But by the same token, I don't think you would ever be  able to ask those kind of questions you were asking to that man  to George Bush either, would you?</p>
<p>   MITCHELL: Well, I think you can. It doesn't always happen.  I've been looking back at all of this -- it's one of the reasons  I wrote the book -- and I think there has been self-censorship.  And that since 9-11, or after 9-11, there was sort of a rallying  around -- and understandable sort of patriotic effect -- and I  think reporters were less challenging.</p>
<p>   From Friedman's September 21 column (subscription required),  titled &quot;Bush's Waterlogged Halo&quot;:</p>
<p>   Katrina deprived the Bush team of the energy source that  propelled it forward for the last four years: 9/11 and the halo  over the presidency that came with it. The events of 9/11 created  a deference in the U.S. public, and media, for the  administration, which exploited it to the hilt to push an  uncompassionate conservative agenda on tax cuts and runaway  spending, on which it never could have gotten elected. That  deference is over.</p>

<p>   From a Sept. 17 Los Angeles Times article headlined &quot;TV  Journalists Stay on Story, and Say It Will Stay With Them&quot;:</p>
<p>   (Brian) Williams, the NBC anchor, is now pondering how the  press has covered the government -- and whether the news media  has been tough enough. </p>
<p>   &quot;I think we've always had our voice,&quot; he said. Still, &quot;I do  think -- and this is a subject for a long-term study -- the news  media have been operating under a loose kind of 9/11 syndrome. </p>
<p>   &quot;Perhaps we are guilty of settling in to too comfortable a  journalistic pattern, and perhaps this tragedy did serve as a  reminder that this is what we do,&quot; Williams added. &quot;I think too  many people had forgotten that. There is a reason we show up  after awful events. We really were the viewers' advocates on  this.&quot;</p>
