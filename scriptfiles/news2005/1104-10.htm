<p>NEW YORK - November 4 - Today, Dianne Stewart, Director of Public Works: the Demos Center for the Public Sector, issued the following statement applauding Colorado's voters for their recent decision to suspend a state spending restriction that was passed in 1993:

<p>"On November 1, Colorado voters approved a five-year suspension of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights (TABOR), the strictest state spending limit in the nation. This vote was a victory for Colorado's quality of life and a win for democracy and the public structures that help promote strong communities and a vibrant economy.

<p>"The 12-year-old Colorado law--also known as TABOR--was the result of a 1993 ballot initiative that was marketed as a way to cap government growth. This provision limited increases in state spending to the previous year's revenue, plus population growth and inflation, with any revenue in excess of the cap to be returned to taxpayers. After revenues declined in the recent recession the cap was automatically "ratcheted" down, resulting in a dramatic reduction of state spending. The same recession caused greater demands on state government, as the newly unemployed sought temporary assistance with food, shelter and health care. At the same time other state expenses, notably for prisons and jails, were pushed higher by tough sentencing and parole laws.

<p>"While TABOR wreaked deep and lasting fiscal damage, it also undermined basic structures of representative democracy and subverted democratic decision-making. Taking away from elected representatives the responsibility to weigh the needs of the state and balance the realities of the economy, TABOR put vital decision making into a mechanism that could not be adjusted without a state-wide referendum--a process that would be heavily influenced by well-heeled interests that could fund an expensive opposition campaign. This subversion of healthy democracy forced elected officials to endanger the state's public structures and its economic health by cutting higher education, k-12 education and public health--and by neglecting infrastructure needs, such as highway and bridge maintenance and construction.

<p>"In the last couple of years far-right operatives have undertaken a well-financed effort to export TABOR around the country. As a result, a number of states are currently considering TABOR-like measures, including Oklahoma, Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin.

<p>"But in its home territory, TABOR is now starting to be recognized for the lasting harm it has inflicted. Colorado's business leaders, legislators from both sides of the aisle and the State's Republican Governor, Bill Owens--joined by voters from across the state--came together to promote a proposal to suspend TABOR's spending limits for five years. Though extremists threatened political retaliation against the Governor and other Republican officials, their leadership ensured that the rational, moderate position prevailed and restored the ability of Colorado's elected representatives to put the common good of Colorado first.

<p>"The victory in Colorado shows that voters from all across the political spectrum are coming to understand that adequate support of our public systems is essential to our shared well-being. Their vote this week recognizes the important role that government must play, in partnership with businesses and communities, to meet the needs and hopes of its citizens."
