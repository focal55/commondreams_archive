<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 4 - President Bush has nominated 3rd Circuit 

<p>Court Judge Samuel Alito to replace Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. 

Advocates have raised concerns about Judge Alito's record on the spectrum of civil 

rights issues, and a number of groups have already announced their opposition to 

his nomination. Alito's record is said to be in line with conservative Justice 

Scalia, so much so that his nickname is "Scalito."



<p>To help activists stay informed and connected to the progressive community in this 

fight, Moving Ideas just released "<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/supreme_court_action.htm">Progressives' Guide to the Samuel Alito 

Nomination</a>" , our 

one-stop guide to information on Alito and ways activists can get involved. This 

guide is constantly updated with the latest actions and reports.


<p>"Our civil rights and liberties are at stake in this fight," says Moving Ideas 

Director Melanie Alston-Akers. "The public must get involved in urging the Senate 

to thoroughly vet this nominee, and to ensure that he will protect our rights."
<p> This activist guide includes the latest reports on Alito from the progressive 

community, actions to contact Senators, and ways to get communities involved.
<p> Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located 

in Moving Ideas' <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm">Progressive Policy Experts Database</a>
