<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 11 -- Sarah Brady, chair of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following statement about legislation passed in Kansas last week, SB 195:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Kansas Legislature last week passed a bill that should be called the 'No Local Rights' bill. If Senate Bill 195 becomes law, no city or town in Kansas would be able to pass its own regulations about guns, if those regulations are stricter than state law. That's a lot of nonsense, and Governor Sebelius should veto it, and the legislature should uphold her veto.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since 1860, local communities in Kansas have been regulating firearms because locally elected officials understood that different laws are necessary in different communities. People can feel the way they want about gun laws, but we should all agree that in a democracy, the people of a local community should be able to take the appropriate steps to ensure their safety locally. That's what democracy is all about. To pass this wrong headed language into law is contrary to democracy.&quot; </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
