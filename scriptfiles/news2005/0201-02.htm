Leaders of the international movement for debt cancellation will urge the U.S. government to secure 100% debt cancellation for impoverished countries at the G7 meeting.<br> <br>Tuesday&#146;s action will feature a dramatic presentation by leading debt campaigners of 12 reasons why debt cancellation must be definitive and must happen now. This will be followed by a delivery of a petition with 4,000 signatures to a representative of the Treasury Department, calling on Treasury Secretary Snow to negotiate a deal on 100% debt cancellation without harmful conditions.<br> <br>The U.S. has claimed that it supports multilateral debt cancellation for 42 impoverished countries, to be paid for by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), however it has recently indicated that it may accept a less definitive deal, as proposed by the U.K. or others, if it is considered to reduce debts to so-called &quot;sustainable&quot; <br>levels. The petition emphasizes the need for 100% debt cancellation for impoverished countries, because the debts are illegitimate and because no amount of debt can be sustainable to countries facing extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS and other urgent human development challenges.</font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
