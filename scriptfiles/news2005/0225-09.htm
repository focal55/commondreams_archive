<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 25 -- A group of progressive investigative bloggers has launched BlogCall, a brand new press conference call where members of the mainstream media can pose questions to newsmaking bloggers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first BlogCall was held on Thursday, February 24, and it featured John Aravosis of Americablog.com discussing his newsmaking work on &quot;Gannongate.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aravosis is a leading progressive blogger who exposed White House reporter &quot;Jeff Gannon&quot; as a gay prostitute whose real name is James Guckert. Aravosis discussed the latest developments in the story during the 45-minute conference call.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The press conference was webcast by <a href="http://RadioLeft.com/" target="_new">RadioLeft.com</a>, and is permanently archived at <a href="http://www.WhiteRoseSociety.org/" target="_new">WhiteRoseSociety.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Progressive bloggers are doing outstanding investigative work at a time when the mainstream media is passively watching the innumerable scandals of the Bush administration,&quot; said Bob Fertik, President of Democrats.com and founder of BlogCall. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These under-investigated scandals include Dick Cheney's still-secret Energy Task Force, the administration's Iraq War lies, and the criminal outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame by a top White House official. BlogCall will build a bridge between progressive investigative bloggers who are investigating those important scandals and the mainstream media,&quot; Fertik said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BlogCall will begin a regular weekly schedule on Tuesday, March 8. The next featured blogger will be Brad Friedman of <a href="http://www.BradBlog.com/" target="_new">BradBlog.com</a>, who has exposed the story of Clint Curtis, the Florida computer programmer who wrote &quot;vote-flipping&quot; software for touchscreen machines at the request of powerful Republican Congressman Tom Feeney.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progressive bloggers and mainstream journalists are invited to participate in BlogCall by submitting their credentials at <a href="http://BlogCall.org/" target="_new">BlogCall.org</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
