<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 18 -- Derbyshire, UK. 18 March 2005&#151; Greenpeace today expressed its disappointment in reaction to the communiqu&eacute; on illegal logging issued by G8 Environment and Development Ministers who today ended a two-day meeting in Derbyshire. The G8 ministers failed to commit to adopting legislation to prohibit import of illegal timber and wood products into their countries, despite a very strong call by NGOs, industry and research institutions. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the G8 committed to a range of important  actions to address illegal logging in their statement, including taking &#147;steps to halt the import and marketing of illegally logged timber&#148;, it is unsatisfactory that the statement only refers to voluntary measures, which will do little to curb the flooding of G8 markets with these products. They also only agreed to &#147;encourage, adopt or extend public timber procurement policies that favour legal timber&#148;, which only outlaws illegal wood, and ignores the huge impact that legalised, but unsustainable, logging has on the world&#146;s forests and the millions of people that rely on them directly for their livelihood.<br> <br>&#147;The G8 is once again proving its value as a talking shop rather than a forum for taking urgently needed action.  The world's ancient forests cannot rely on half-hearted voluntary measures, and the G8 is failing to deliver.  While we welcome their recognition of the problem and the re-commitment to existing political agreements and processes such as the FLEGT (2) and CBD (3), this is like putting a band-aid on a gunshot wound,&#148; said Nathalie Rey from Greenpeace International.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notes to Editors<br>1)    The statement on illegal logging will be forwarded to the Chair of the Gleneagles Summit of Heads of States and Government which is taking  place from the 6-8 July.<br>2)    Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade<br>3)    Convention on Biological Diversity</font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
