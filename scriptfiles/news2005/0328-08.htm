<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SANTA BARBARA --  March 28 -- The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation is pleased to announce the opening of its Washington, DC office.  Carah Ong, the Foundation&#146;s Advocacy and Research Director will staff the office, which is located at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation on Capitol Hill. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a Washington, DC office, the Foundation will be able to respond more rapidly and effectively to national nuclear policy issues and work in collaboration with other non-governmental organizations at the national level for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament.  It will also allow the Foundation to develop closer working relationships with policymakers.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Foundation President David Krieger said, &#147;The Washington, DC office will make the Foundation an even more effective force for change in US nuclear policy by allowing us to be in closer touch with policymakers.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Foundation currently has an advocacy campaign, Turn the Tide, that seeks to chart a new course for US nuclear policy in which the US would provide leadership toward the global elimination of nuclear weapons.  The Turn the Tide campaign is made up of concerned citizens and organizations that have a vested interest in reducing and eliminating nuclear dangers and in making Americans far safer and more secure. The goal of the campaign is to educate the public and engage citizens in advocating for US nuclear policies that will provide security for the US and the world.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation is a non-profit, non-partisan international organization with consultative status to the United Nations.  For more than 20 years, the Foundation has been committed to advancing initiatives to eliminate the nuclear weapons threat to all life, to fostering the global rule of law, and to building an enduring legacy of peace through education and advocacy.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
