<p>BOSTON - December 1 - A plan by a private company to sell mitigation 
            credits that entitle developers to destroy natural wetlands in the 
            Taunton River Watershed will likely result in a net loss of 
            wetlands, according to Public Employees for Environmental 
            Responsibility (PEER). PEER is one of eleven national, state and 
            local environmental groups who are asking the Commonwealth of 
            Massachusetts to hold off spending taxpayer dollars on the banking 
            scheme until a number of legal and biological questions have been 
            answered.</P>
            <P>The mitigation credit bank allows developers to buy the right to 
            fill in naturally functioning wetlands by purchasing the promise of 
            the creation or restoration of wetlands elsewhere. This proposed 
            wetlands trading market is being pushed by a company called Blue 
            Wave Strategies. </P>
            <P>&#8220;This wetlands mitigation banking scheme works like an 
            environmental Enron, where the true losses do not become evident 
            until it is too late,&#8221; stated Kyla Bennett, the New England Director 
            of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). &#8220;The 
            scheme put forward by Blue Wave Strategies is not only contrary to 
            public policy on its face, but its current proposal flies in the 
            face of scientific facts.&#8221;</P>
            <P>Massachusetts has already lost an estimated one-third of all its 
            historic wetlands. To counter continuing losses, state wetlands 
            protection laws have become among the strictest in the nation. PEER 
            contends that wetlands banking could completely circumvent 
            protections for the remaining marshes, vernal pools and forested 
            wetlands. Concerns about the mitigation bank include:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P>The lack of an enforcement mechanism to make sure that promised 
              mitigation is in fact done and the lack of any accountability or 
              consequences for developers who skip out on their obligations; 
</P>
              <LI>
              <P>Absence of any assurance of true biological equivalence for the 
              loss of a natural wetland; and</P>
              <LI>
              <P>Inability to address a number of legal hurdles against offering 
              mitigation in an entirely different watershed from where the 
              construction damage occurs. </P></LI></UL>
            <P>Blue Wave Strategies is headed by a former state and federal 
            official named John DeVillars who has been peddling conversion of 
            toxic Superfund sites for private use since he left government. The 
            company wants to convert areas near the Burrage Pond Wildlife 
            Management Area in southeastern Massachusetts into a site for 
            wetlands mitigation, but the area already contains over 1600 acres 
            of open water, marsh, and Atlantic White Cedar and red maple swamps. 
            Moreover, other regulatory agencies have expressed an interest in 
            pursuing restoration in the area, without the use of any mitigation 
            bank credits.</P>
            <P>On a national level, wetlands mitigation banking has been a 
            dismal failure, according to a series of official reviews. Most 
            recently, the Government Accountability Office issued a blistering 
            report faulting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for its failure to 
            oversee whether mitigation that was made a condition of permits 
            issued to dredge or fill wetlands ever actually occurred.</P>
            <P>&#8220;This banking set-up puts money in the pockets of Blue Wave 
            Strategies by making them middlemen in an wetlands shell game,&#8221; 
            added Bennett. &#8220;State regulators may be tempted to buy a supposedly 
            painless solution to developer demands without any regard for the 
            true, long-term costs.&#8221;</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
