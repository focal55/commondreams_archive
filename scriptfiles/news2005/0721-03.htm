<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 21  - Tonight, the Republican-controlled House Committee on Rules denied members of the U.S. House the opportunity to vote on critical legislation proposed by Rep. Sanders that would restore Americans&#146; constitutionally guaranteed right to read and access information without governmental intrusion or monitoring. The Patriot Act amendment denied a vote by the committee was substantively identical to the amendment Sanders offered and the House approved in June as part of the Justice Department appropriations bill. Sanders&#146; June legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, with 199 Democrats and 38 Republicans voting in favor of the amendment.  </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &#147;It is an outrage that the Republican leadership has decided to use their power to subvert the will of the majority of House members. Just last month, the House overwhelmingly voted to approve this very same legislation. Instead of respecting the will of the American people and their Representatives in Congress, the Republican leadership has decided to trample on our democratic rights by denying Congress a vote.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders&#146; was attempting to offer the amendment to the USA Patriot Act reauthorization bill currently before the House. Sanders&#146; amendment addressed Section 215 of the Patriot Act which enables federal agents to get orders from a secret court allowing them to access, among other things, the reading records of Americans in both libraries and bookstores. Because these orders are granted by a secret court, the people whose records are sought have no opportunity to oppose the order. In most cases the person whose records are acquired would never know it because the law itself makes it a criminal offense for the librarian or bookseller to notify them. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders&#146; previously-passed amendment, which was part of the Science, State, Justice appropriations bill, effectively prohibits the government from using these secret court orders to gain access to Americans&#146; reading records during the year-long life of that spending bill. The Republican leadership has already indicated that they would attempt to strip that amendment in the conference committee. The passage of this amendment as part of the Patriot Act reauthorization would have made these safeguards permanent. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &#147;It is unconscionable that the same Republican leadership that is asking us to trust them not to abuse the powers granted by the Patriot Act has so blatantly abused their power to undermine the democratic process in Congress. Unfortunately, even when a strong majority of members express their will, their actions are ignored.  We will continue to work to ensure that the American people&#146;s voices are heard on this matter by fighting to make sure our previously passed appropriations amendment is made law.&#148;</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
