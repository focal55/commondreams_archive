<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHICAGO, IL -- February 7 --  U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Chief Deputy Whip, voiced her resounding opposition to President Bush's Fiscal Year 2006 budget, adding that &quot;millions of Americans should not stand for a President who puts tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of the needs of veterans, seniors, and the homeless.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is an outrage that President Bush would put the interests of millionaires ahead of the well-being of veterans, seniors, the poor, and the working class.  By limiting the tax cuts to the first $200,000 in income, there would be an extra $19.2 billion in revenues, enough to avoid cuts in veterans health care, education, and environmental cleanup,&quot; Schakowsky said.</font></p><p> </p><p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush has gone on the attack.  The Bush budget is a weapon of mass destruction aimed squarely at true and proven programs that improve the quality of life for low and middle income Americans.  This is a morally reprehensible budget that clearly demonstrates President Bush's lack of compassion, misplaced priorities, and warped values,&quot; Schakowsky added.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            According to the Bush budget, discretionary, non-defense spending will be slashed by 1% (before adjusting for inflation), 150 programs will be reduced or eliminated, resulting in cuts of about $20 billion in 2006.  For example, the Bush budget cuts:</font></p><p> </p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Law enforcement grants to states by $1.3 billion. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Lead Hazard Reduction program by $48 million (Illinois ranks first in the nation in the number of children identified as lead poisoned). <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$440 million in Safe and Drug-Free School grants. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$500 million in state education technology grants. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Housing for persons with disabilities from $238 million in 2005 to $120 million in 2006.  <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS by $14 million. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$225 from Even Start literacy program. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$250 million for railroad rehabilitation. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$100 million for land and water conservation grants. <br> </font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            In addition, Schakowsky added that the budget calls for a ten-year, $60 billion cut in Medicaid funding for the states.  &quot;This is going to jeopardize access to health care for pregnant women, children, and people with disabilities, as well as force drastic cuts in long-term care services at a time when people are losing coverage and costs are going up.  This dramatic slash in funding will have a devastating impact on individuals' health and families' budgets,&quot; she added.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The Bush Administration's 2006 budget also doubles co-payments for prescription drugs for many veterans and adds a yearly payment of $250 for thousands of veterans wanting to enroll in the system.  Generally, the budget adds more than $4 trillion to the deficit in the next 10 years, but that excludes the cost of the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and how the President plans to pay for his radical plan to privatize Social Security that would cut guaranteed benefits by almost 50 percent.</font></p><p> </p><p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is clear where President Bush stands - he is willing to sacrifice the needs of the many for the benefit of the few.  Congress must now show the courage to act where the President has failed to lead,&quot; Schakowsky concluded.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
