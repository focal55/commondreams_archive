<p>AMSTERDAM - Plants created using Terminator technology will produce sterile seeds,
creating a monopoly and unnatural control of the seeds. Farmers will
not be able to use seeds from such plants for the following season's
cultivation.&nbsp; The seeds will rot in the soil without producing new
plants.&nbsp; If this technology is introduced in crops such as soya, wheat,
canola and cotton it will force farmers to buy new seeds every year from the same company.<br>
<br>
"Farmers should be aware that corporations all over the world are ready
to take control of their seeds with genetic engineering (GE). These
corporations will control the entire food chain with the help of
monopoly patents and Terminator technology," said Christoph Then,
Greenpeace International GE campaigner. "We need a global ban on this
technology and on any patents on seeds. These corporate instruments
will disrupt the backbone of global food supply, making it impossible
for the farmers to reuse their own harvest for planting."<br>
<br>
So far, the market introduction of the Terminator technology-which was
already developed about ten years ago-was successfully prevented
through worldwide protest of several groups and stakeholders. But many
observers believe that the GE industry will drive towards the
legalisation of this technology at the meeting of the UN Convention on
Biological Diversity in March next year. The grant of the patent could push even harder for market introduction.<br>
<br>
"These new patents confirm that corporations are once again actively
pursuing Terminator technology and an international ban on the
technology is urgently needed," said Lucy Sharratt, Coordinator of the
new global Ban Terminator Campaign, which involves farmers unions,
environmental and Indigenous people organisations (2). <br>
<br>
Although the GE industry claims that Terminator technology will help
contain the spread of GE contamination, Greenpeace believes otherwise.
"GE technology can not be controlled by Terminator seeds. On the
contrary, it is likely that farmers <br>
will find their harvest being contaminated with this Terminator
technology, if introduced. This is a real threat for estimated 80% of
the farmers all over the world who save their seeds for cultivation."<br>
<br>

Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful
future.</p>
