<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 15 -- MoveOn PAC announced that it will begin airing a radio ad campaign in the Congressional districts of House Democratic Whip, Steny Hoyer (MD) and 10 Republican members of Congress who voted for a bankruptcy bill yesterday that would hurt middle class families.  The bankruptcy bill is the latest in a series of Republican initiatives to benefit corporate special interests and the super-rich at the expense of middle- and lower-income American families.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our ad campaign will serve notice to politicians in both parties, that when they masquerade as populist friends of the middle class but vote the other way, we&#146;ll be there to hold them accountable,&#148; said Tom Matzzie, MoveOn PAC&#146;s Washington Director.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Democrats need to be united in their opposition to bills like this that attack hardworking Americans.  This is especially true for Steny Hoyer, the Democratic Whip, who has a good record on most issues, but should have stood up against the credit card companies and been a leader in his party. Democrats should be the defender of the middle class. Every time they defend the middle class values against Republican assaults, they&#146;ll inspire people to vote for them; give them hope that the political process is worth engaging in; which means they will win national elections,&#148; Matzzie continued.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;When Republicans legislate in Washington for corporate special interests at the expense of working families, we&#146;ll be there to blow the whistle at home,&#148; Matzzie concluded.   </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MoveOn PAC will run radio spots in the districts of the following ten Republican congressman: Marilyn Musgrave (CO), Katherine Harris (FL), Jim Nussle (IA), Chris Chocola (IN), Jim Hostettler (IN), Mike Sodrel (IN), Charles Taylor (NC), Heather Wilson (NM), Thelma Drake (VA) and Randy Kuhl (NY). The ads criticize Members of Congress for being friendlier to the banks and other companies that issue credit cards than they are to the majority of their constituents.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Audio of the ad will be available at <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/bankruptcyads" target="_new">www.moveonpac.org/bankruptcyads</a> after 8:00 p.m. ET today.  A script of the ad follows.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
