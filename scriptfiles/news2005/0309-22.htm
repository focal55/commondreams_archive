<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 9 -- The House Government Reform Committee today issued 11 subpoenas to compel witnesses to testify before the Committee March 17th for a hearing on the use of steroids in Major League Baseball.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The subpoenas were issued to seven current or former major league players: Jose Canseco, Jason Giambi, Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Curt Schilling, Sammy Sosa, and Frank Thomas.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subpoenas were also issued to four baseball officials: Robert Manfred, executive vice president and labor counsel, Major League Baseball, who will testify on behalf of Commissioner Bud Selig; Don Fehr, executive director and general counsel, Major League Baseball Players Association; Sandy Alderson, former general manager of the Oakland Athletics and current MLB executive vice president of baseball operations; and Kevin Towers, general manager of the San Diego Padres.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Committee Chairman Tom Davis (R-VA) and Ranking Member Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) issued the following joint statement on the issuance of the subpoenas:</font></p><p> </p><p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today the Committee issued subpoenas for the March 17th hearing on the use of steroids and baseball.   It is important to note that some of the subpoenas are 'friendly' in nature - Jose Canseco, Donald Fehr and Rob Manfred, for example, have already told the Committee they will testify.  They are receiving subpoenas simply to guarantee their appearance.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The remaining witnesses, however, made it clear - either by flatly rejecting the invitation to testify or by ignoring our repeated attempts to contact them - they had no intention of appearing before the Committee.  They have left the Committee no alternative but to issue subpoenas.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Committee will conduct a thorough, fair, and responsible investigation.  It is important the American people know the facts on baseball's steroid scandal. And it is important that all Americans, especially children, know about the dangers of drug use.  Consistent with our jurisdiction over the nation's drug policy, we need to better understand the steps MLB is taking to get a handle on the steroid issue, and whether news of those steps - and the public health danger posed by steroid use - is reaching America's youth.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
