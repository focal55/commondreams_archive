<p>WASHINGTON - November 18 - "Early this morning the House passed, by the narrowest of margins, a Budget Reconciliation bill that spares the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and coastlines from drilling but puts America's public lands up for sale. The Sierra Club is delighted that the controversial provisions for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife and offshore were stripped from the budget package prior to a vote but remain concerned that the bill will become a vehicle for the resurrection of these rejected ideas.

<p>"We thank those Members of Congress who helped keep Arctic and offshore drilling out of the budget in this round. We urge them to stand strong and ensure that the budget does not become a vehicle for those losing provisions and the bad measures on mining and cuts to conservation programs that remained in the bill. America deserves an honest dialogue about a real energy future, not bogus policy crammed through in the federal budget.

<p>"The removal of Arctic and coastal drilling by no means implies this bill is good for America. The House passed a bill loaded down with draconian cuts to programs for the most vulnerable in our country, provisions to allow mining and other companies to privatize public lands, serious funding cuts for important conservation programs, and a split in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

<p>"The removal of Arctic and coastal drilling clearly demonstrates that attempts to pass Arctic Refuge and coastal drilling through the budget process are non-starters with the American people and the House. Leadership was under intense pressure from moderate Republicans opposed to drilling, and we hope their firm stand serves as a warning that any budget that would open the Arctic Refuge or America?s coasts to destructive drilling faces a dead-end in the House.

<p>"Unfortunately, the oil and gas industries and their allies in Congress will not take 'no' for an answer. They have coveted the America's Arctic Refuge and coasts for decades, and they will not give up easily. The Senate version of the Budget does include an Arctic drilling provision, and they will try to send a final bill back to the House with Arctic drilling still in. And some members in the House are still intent on opening up America's coasts to oil and gas drilling as well."
