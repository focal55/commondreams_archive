<p>WASHINGTON - September 27 - A prominent national  Islamic civil rights and advocacy group today called on the  Pentagon to probe allegations that American troops in Iraq are  using photographs of Iraqi corpses as &quot;currency&quot; to gain access  to Internet pornography.
<p>   The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said the  grisly practice, which the Washington-based group says may  violate international laws of war, came to light in recent media  reports. </p>
<p>   According to California's East Bay Express: &quot;The captions that  accompany these images, which were apparently written by the  soldiers who posted them, laugh and gloat over the bodies. . .One  soldier posted three photographs of corpses lying in the street  and titled his collection &quot;DIE HAJI DIE.&quot; The soldiers take  pride, even joy, in displaying the dead.&quot;</p>

<p>   &quot;This disgusting trade in human misery is an insult to all  those who have served in our nation's military,&quot; said CAIR Legal  Director Arsalan Iftikhar in a letter to Secretary of Defense  Donald Rumsfeld. Iftikhar told Rumsfeld the Pentagon should  &quot;investigate this troubling phenomenon and do whatever is  necessary to bring it to an end.&quot;</p>

<p>   According to the Geneva Conventions: &quot;The remains of persons  who have died for reasons related to occupation or in detention  resulting from occupation or hostilities and those of persons not  nationals of the country in which they have died as a result of  hostilities shall be respected.&quot;</p>
