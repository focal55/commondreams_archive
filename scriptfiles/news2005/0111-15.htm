<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 11 -- ACORN International today called on Tom Ridge, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to extend Temporary Protective Status to immigrants from countries affected by the tsunami of Dec. 26, 2004.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Immigrants from these communities have lost family members, friends and entire communities,&quot; said ACORN National Vice President Maria Polanco. &quot;Secretary Ridge should not allow people to be deported into chaotic situations where hundreds of thousands are scrambling for food, clean water and adequate shelter.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Government has often provided Temporary Protective Status to immigrants whose home countries have been ravaged by natural disaster or armed conflict. In October and November of 1998 Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 persons and TPS was granted the next month to over 150,000 Hondurans and Nicaraguans living in the United States at the time.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department's Web site states that the secretary may designate a country for TPS if &quot;the state has suffered an environmental disaster resulting in a substantial temporary disruption of living conditions&quot; and &quot;the state is temporarily unable to handle adequately the return of its nationals.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security announced measures to expedite certain immigration applications, but has yet to take action to extend Temporary Protected Status to all immigrants affected by this disaster.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today about two million people from tsunami affected countries such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Maldives and Somalia (which has been ignored in many relief efforts) are living in the United States. Immigration Services identifies more than 4,000 of these people as deportable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACORN International is a branch of ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, the nation's largest membership organization of low and moderate income families. ACORN has worked to protect the rights of immigrants, and ACORN International is, in part, an outgrowth of its large immigrant membership.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Jan. 12, ACORN will also make a page available on its Web site for concerned Americans to send emails to Secretary Ridge and Congress asking them to support TPS status for immigrants affected by the tsunami.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security has an opportunity to assist relief efforts by offering TPS to people whose home countries are now overwhelmed,&quot; Polanco said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ACORN is the nation's largest community organization of low- and moderate-income families, with over 175,000 member families organized into 800 neighborhood chapters in 80 cities across the country. Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on issues of concern to their members. Their priorities include: better housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for low-wage workers, more investment in our communities from banks and governments, and better public schools. They achieve these goals by building community organizations that have the power to win changes -- through direct action, negotiation, legislation, and voter participation. ACORN is an acronym, and each letter should be capitalized. ACORN stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
