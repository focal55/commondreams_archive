<td colspan="2"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 5 - &quot;Corporate Accountability International and our members are hopeful that the appointment of Professor John Ruggie as the United Nations' first Special Representative on human rights and transnational corporations will move the global community beyond the voluntary initiatives of the Global Compact toward enforceable global standards to hold corporations accountable for human rights abuses.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The role of Special Representative on issues of human rights and TNCs carries enormous responsibility. Corporate Accountability International has campaigned for nearly three decades to protect people from dangerous corporate actions, including Nestle's irresponsible infant formula marketing and Philip Morris/Altria's interference in public health policies. The United Nations' World Health Organization has since passed codes for infant formula marketing and the groundbreaking global tobacco treaty--formally known as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)--to defend people from these corporate abuses. The United Nations' creation of a Special Representative on human rights and transnational corporations is an important step for the corporate accountability movement, acknowledging the need for more comprehensive international control of corporate abuses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ruggie has been an advocate for transparency, corporate social and environmental reporting and corporate accountability to civil society and the general public. He has brought attention to corporations including Halliburton and General Electric for their complicity in oil-for-food politics. Part of Dr. Ruggie's mandate is to help clarify what constitutes 'complicity' of corporations in human rights abuses. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As one of the key architects of the Global Compact--the UN's voluntary corporate citizenship initiative--Dr. Ruggie is probably well aware of its limitations. Now Dr. Ruggie can help the global community take the next step by recommending enforceable human rights standards for transnational corporations. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We encourage Dr. Ruggie to use the United Nations' Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises with Regard to Human Rights as a framework for his recommendations to the UN Commission on Human Rights during his tenure as the Special Representative. We also urge Dr. Ruggie to incorporate the impact of TNCs on public health in the context of human rights, and to consider the precedents set by the global tobacco treaty as a model for global corporate accountability instruments.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The global tobacco treaty includes a ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, affirms the participation of civil society in achieving the objectives of the treaty and insulates public health policy from interference by the tobacco industry. Just as Philip Morris/Altria and British American Tobacco (BAT) have no place determining health policies, junk food corporations have no place influencing nutrition policy. Similarly, transnational corporations that are implicated in human rights abuses should be excluded from human rights policymaking. The FCTC establishes a precedent for such exclusion based on conflict of interest. Corporate Accountability International has developed draft Standards of Political Conduct for Corporations that should also be considered in identifying and clarifying standards of corporate accountability with regard to human rights.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Giant corporations operate worldwide without enough limits to their power or strong, enforceable standards to protect people. We hope Dr. Ruggie will be an ally to the corporate accountability movement, and help the global community protect people's lives over corporate profits.&quot;</font></p>
