<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 22 -- News Advisory: The nation's leading consumer groups, joined by advocates for small farmers, will release disturbing information about consumers unknowingly forfeiting their right to fair redress in millions of contracts for everything from credit cards to health insurance to employment to pet grooming. The number of consumers now signing contracts with BMA (binding mandatory arbitration) clauses is growing exponentially. At the press conference, the nation's consumer leaders will release detailed information on the scope of the problem, the number of consumers involved, how these agreements are hidden in everyday contracts and the steps consumers must take to &quot;get back their rights.&quot; The press conference will kick off a major national campaign to educate Americans and outline steps needed to correct the problem. A specific, 10-point plan of action will be released at the press conference. Particularly noteworthy is the broad and diverse collection of organizations taking part in this campaign.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Press Conference: The Erosion of Consumer and Employment Rights and Announcing a National &quot;Give Me Back My Rights&quot; Campaign including public education, legislative action, and protests.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: National Press Club (Murrow Room), 529 14th Street NW Washington DC</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Thursday, February 24, 2005 at 11 a.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organizations Speaking at the Press Conference: Consumer Task Force for Automotive Issues, Public Citizen, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Rural Advancement Foundation International (advocates for small farmers), Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, Others TBA</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Give Me Back My Rights&quot; is operating, in part, under a grant from the AARP</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COALITION MEMBERS: ACORN, Alliance for Justice, American Association for People with Disabilities, Center for Auto Safety, Center for Responsible Lending, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Task Force for Automotive Issues, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, Consumers Union, National Association of Consumer Advocates, Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, National Consumer Law Center, National Employment Lawyers Association, Public Citizen, Senator Patrick Leahy, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Workplace Fairness.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
