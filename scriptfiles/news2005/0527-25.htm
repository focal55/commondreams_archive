<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON-- May 26-- On the eve of the introduction of the bipartisan Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005, three large crosses were burned in separate spots around Durham, North Carolina, and yellow fliers with Ku Klux Klan sayings were found at one location. </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This evening, in response to the reported cross-burnings, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance, sent the following note of support to the organizers of the candlelight vigils responding to the intolerable acts of hatred and prejudice.  </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;People of faith and goodwill across the nation and across the world are shocked and saddened by the cross burnings last night in Durham, North Carolina The sacred scriptures of many different faith traditions speak with one voice on the subject of intolerance. Hatred is neither a religious nor American value.  </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is another reminder of the crying need for the Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Act of 2005, which was re-introduced this very morning in the House by a bipartisan group of representatives. If we aspire to be true to the core of our religious traditions, we cannot condemn hate and then sit idly by while it destroys our communities. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Please know that even though we cannot be with you tonight at your candlelight vigils, The Interfaith Alliance and the entire interfaith movement in America stands with you in spirit and in love. Thank you for your positive, affirming, responses to these acts of hatred.&quot; </font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
