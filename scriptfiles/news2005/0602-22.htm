<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRUSSELS -- Greenpeace launched a unique photo collection today that shows serious heat loss in buildings across the EU, and called on members of the European Parliament meeting next week to support ambitious targets for energy efficiency.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The pictures that we have taken in the different capitals illustrate how energy is wasted day and night in our homes, offices, factories and public buildings, and that a huge potential for energy efficiency measures exists,&quot; said Roger Spautz of Greenpeace Luxembourg, who coordinated the photos, contained in a postcard booklet entitled 'Save the Climate' [1].</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the start of 2005, Greenpeace has visited 23 capitals of European Union countries (all except Cyprus and Malta) to analyse the state of insulation in public and private buildings. The infrared thermographic pictures highlight areas of thermal weakness and leakage. At the Pompidou Centre in Paris, for example, heat is lost through the glass coverings of the walkways, which are red in the thermographic picture, while a residential building in Lisbon has clear heat bridges in its walls and floors. In contrast, the Prague Ministry of Trade, a historic building, shows fairly good heat efficiency, except through its windows.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Insulation and thermal design can dramatically reduce heat loss and help stop climate change. Energy demand for heating in existing buildings can be reduced on average by 30-50%. In new buildings it can be reduced by 90-95%, using widely available and competitive technology and design [2].</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 8 June, the European Parliament will vote on the Directive on Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services [3]. Greenpeace criticises the proposed Directive's low mandatory targets for annual energy savings, which equal just 1% of private customer energy use and 1.5% of the amount distributed to the public sector. Greenpeace advises annual targets of at least 2.5% for the private sector and 3% for the public sector. (It is estimated that current energy demand can be cut in a cost-effective manner by as much as 30% in the medium term [4].)</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Energy efficiency would cut carbon dioxide emissions, bring a net gain to Europe's economy and reduce our dependency on energy imports, but this potential will be wasted if the European Parliament does not support high mandatory targets for energy efficiency. This would be as irresponsible as using a hair-dryer to heat a house,&quot; said Mahi Sideridou of Greenpeace European Unit. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The European Commission is this month due to adopt a Green Paper on energy efficiency. The photos released today by Greenpeace highlight the urgent need for action on this issue.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTES TO EDITOR<br>1. Greenpeace postcard booklet of thermographic photos is available at <a href="http://eu.greenpeace.org/downloads/energy/SaveTheClimate.pdf" target="_new">http://eu.greenpeace.org/downloads/energy/SaveTheClimate.pdf</a>. <br>The thermographic camera shows details the eye cannot detect. Parts of the building that have a higher surface temperature than the rest appear in yellow and red. This means that in these areas heat is leaking through gaps and poor insulating materials, and valuable energy is being lost. This results both in damage to the environment due to a waste of energy resources, and to unnecessary costs for home owners and tenants. A typical weak point is window panes and frames and thin walls below windows, where radiators are commonly positioned and insulation should be optimal. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.
