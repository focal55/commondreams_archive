<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ST. LOUIS -- March 8 -- Quentin, the &quot;Miracle Dog,&quot; was supposed to die in August 2003. But when the gas chamber door was opened, there stood Quentin on the corpses of seven less fortunate dogs. Now Quentin is busily promoting a new book, &quot;Miracle Dog: How Quentin Survived the Gas Chamber to Speak for Animals on Death Row.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quentin and Stray Rescue, a non-profit, no-kill animal shelter, held a book launch at the world headquarters of national brokerage firm A.G. Edwards in St. Louis on Feb. 26, 2005 and were awarded $50,000 by Robert Bagby, CEO. In three hours, more than 700 books were signed; Quentin &quot;signs&quot; all books, too.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quentin now travels the globe in first-class accommodations. He parties with celebrities: Pierce Brosnan, Linda Blair, Fred Schneider of the B-52s, Dr. Jane Goodall (she wrote the forward to the book), Elaine Boosler, Mary Tyler Moore, Shirley Jones and many more.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January of 2005 the St. Louis City dog pound shut down its gas chamber due to fund raising and lobbying efforts by Quentin and Randy Grim, founder and director of Stray Rescue.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a stroke of a pen the St. Louis gas chamber was shut down. The catalyst was a check for $14,000 raised -- and signed - - by Quentin. In a visit to the mayor's office, Quentin &quot;convinced&quot; Mayor Francis Slay to change the legal language of the city from animal owner to the more humane and sometimes controversial &quot;guardian.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Randy Grim and Quentin are a juxtaposition of opposite personalities -- quite the comedy pairing -- yet work together like no other team to spread the message of no-kill shelters and animal guardianship, and to call attention to our deplorable system of animal &quot;welfare.&quot; Not only are they known across the world, but also they make fantastic subjects complete with stories of insatiable appetites, chronic flatulence, celebrity encounters and social dysfunctions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Stray Rescue of St. Louis is a non-profit, no-kill animal shelter rescuing abused, neglected and abandoned animals and placing them in loving adoptive homes. Since it's founding in 1998, Stray Rescue has been responsible for finding adoptive homes for more than 5,000 dogs in the St. Louis area.
