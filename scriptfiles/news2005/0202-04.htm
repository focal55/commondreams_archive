<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 2 -- The Japanese government provides no warning to its people that eating dolphin meat is a serious health hazard.<br>Submitted by <a href="http://www.earthisland.org/saveTaijiDolphins/" target="_new">Elsa Nature Conservancy of Japan, One Voice</a>, Earth Island Institute</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three international environmental organizations &#151; the Elsa Nature Conservancy (ENC) of Japan, the International Marine Mammal Project of Earth Island Institute (EII), and One Voice, a leading French animal protection organization &#151; warned today that dolphin meat sold to the Japanese people is highly contaminated with mercury, methylmercury, cadmium, DDT, and PCBs. Despite the scientific evidence of dangerous contamination, the Japanese government provides no warning to its people that eating dolphin meat is a serious health hazard.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dolphin meat on the market in Japan can be mislabeled as &#147;whale&#148; meat. Fishermen drive dolphins into shallow bays and nets, where some are harpooned and butchered in blood-filled waters. Other dolphins are sold for high profits to aquariums around the world.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The people of Japan have long suffered from severe pollution and contamination,&#148; explained David Phillips, Director of EII. &#147;Dolphin and whale meat are seriously contaminated with poisons that can injure, sicken, and kill people. Yet, the Japanese government has taken no steps to protect its people from harm.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If the people of Japan knew the truth, they would refuse to buy the poisoned meat of dolphins and whales that have been brutally slaughtered,&#148; stated Ric O&#146;Barry, Lead Investigator of One Voice, &#147;But the government and the fishing industry keep this dangerous secret hidden from the Japanese people. It is time for the Japanese government to end the slaughter of dolphins and end the poisoning of its people.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ENC acquired a slice of meat from a bottlenose dolphin that was butchered in Futo on November 11, 2004. ENC sent the sample to Hokkaido where Dr. Tetsuya Endo of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Hokkaido, examined it for mercury contamination. Highly polluted, it contained 19.2ppm (parts per million) of mercury, 48 times higher than the maximum advisory level of 0.4ppm set by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry of Japan.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mercury can cause severe damage to the brain and nervous system in adults, and is particularly dangerous for young children and pregnant women. To avoid contamination, consumers in Japan are advised to avoid buying dolphin or &#147;whale&#148; meat.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International teams of scientists have analyzed hundreds samples of whale and dolphin meat sold in Japan. They reported to the International Whaling Commission that more than 90% of the samples exceeded limits for one or more pollutants. One sample had more than 1,600 times the permitted level of mercury. The average level of mercury was more than 5 times the maximum allowable level, while the average concentration of methyl mercury was 4 times the maximum level.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MEDIA ALERT: VIDEO FOOTAGE and PHOTOS of the dolphin drive fisheries of Japan is available from Earth Island Institute by calling (415) 788-3666 or faxing (415) 788-7324.
