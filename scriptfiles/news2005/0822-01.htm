<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->PHILADELPHIA - August 19 -   On Monday, August 22, at 11 a.m., Marq Anderson, American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) national tour manager, will outline plans to remove the military combat boots worn in Iraq by Casey Sheehan from the exhibition "Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War," which is currently in Philadelphia. Anderson will return the boots to Casey's grieving mother, Cindy Sheehan, in Crawford, Texas. The event takes place at Friends Center, in the Rufus Jones Room, 1501 Cherry Street, in Philadelphia.

<p>Marq has been in constant contact with Cindy since her arrival in Crawford. Sheehan was forced to leave Crawford last Thursday, after learning her mother suffered a stroke. He leaves Philadelphia today traveling to Texas to return Casey's boots to his mother upon her return there later this week

<p>Earlier this year, Sheehan donated her son Casey's boots to AFSC's traveling exhibition Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War, which displays a pair of combat boots for every military casualty in Iraq. The exhibition continues growing as the death toll continues to rise.

<p>Sheehan tearfully sat Casey's boots alongside thousands of combat boots representing fallen U.S. soldiers while Eyes Wide Open was on display at Independence Mall in Philadelphia over the July 4 weekend.
