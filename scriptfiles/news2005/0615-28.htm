<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. House of Representatives today voted 
down an amendment that would have placed a one-year moratorium on 
federal raids against medical marijuana patients, but patients and 
their supporters were cheered by an all-time record vote in support 
of the proposal. The amendment, supported by a broad array of 
organizations, including the American Nurses Association and the 
United Methodist Church, was defeated 161-264, receiving 13 more 
votes than an identical proposal received last year.

  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  The bipartisan amendment, introduced by U.S. Reps. Maurice 
Hinchey (D-NY) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), sought to prohibit the 
U.S. Justice Department -- which includes the Drug Enforcement 
Administration -- from spending taxpayer money to arrest or prosecute 
medical marijuana patients in the 10 states where medical marijuana 
is legal: Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, 
Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.

    </font><p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While we're disappointed that the amendment did not pass, a 
record 161 House members voted today to stop arresting medical 
marijuana patients," said Rob Kampia, executive director of the 
Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. "There have been only 
four House floor votes on medical marijuana in the history of the 
country, and this one was our best ever.

     </font><p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With over four-to-one public support for ending medical marijuana 
arrests, it's astounding that 264 House members would vote to spend 
taxpayer money to arrest medical marijuana patients in violation of 
states' rights," said Kampia, referring to a new Mason-Dixon poll 
showing that 68% of voters think "the federal government should not 
prosecute medical marijuana patients," while only 16% said it should. 
(Full results from the poll, released yesterday, are available at 
<a href="http://www.mpp.org/2005MasonDixonPoll/index.html" target="_new">http://www.mpp.org/2005MasonDixonPoll/index.html</a>.)

      </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The first House vote on the issue was on a non-binding resolution 
opposing medical marijuana that passed by a 311-94 margin in 1998. The 
second and third votes were on the same amendment that the House voted 
on today, which failed by margins of 273-152 and 268-148 in 2003 and 
2004, respectively.

     </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  The medical marijuana issue reached a head last week when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the federal government has the 
constitutional authority to arrest medical marijuana patients, even 
in states which permit medical use. The ruling on Gonzales v. Raich 
did not affect the 10 state medical marijuana laws.

      </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In response to the ruling, White House Drug Czar John Walters 
said, "Today's decision marks the end of medical marijuana as a 
political issue." But the next day, the Rhode Island Senate voted 34-2 
in favor of MPP's medical marijuana bill, sending it to the Rhode 
Island House.

     </font><p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The next step is to pass the medical marijuana bills pending in 
New York and Rhode Island, enact medical marijuana laws in several 
other states early next year, and then win on Capitol Hill next summer 
when the House votes on medical marijuana again," said Kampia. "The 
momentum is clearly on our side, and we'll keep fighting until 
Congress listens to the American people and ends this cruel and 
needless war on the sick."

     </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  With more than 17,000 members and 120,000 e-mail subscribers 
nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana 
policy reform organization in the United States. MPP works to 
minimize the harm associated with marijuana-both the consumption of 
marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP 
believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is 
imprisonment. For more information, please visit
