<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Starvin' for Justice 2005:  The 12th Annual Fast & Vigil to Abolish the 
Death Penalty at the US Supreme Court

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 22, 2005 - On the heels of three significant U.S. Supreme Court 
rulings limiting the use of the death penalty, anti-death penalty activists 
will converge on Washington, D.C. next week for the 12th Annual Fast & 
Vigil to Abolish the Death Penalty.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This Supreme Court session has seen the abolition of the death penalty for 
juvenile offenders, and strong rebukes to both prosecutors and defense 
attorneys that will absolutely reduce the number of people executed in this 
country," said Abe Bonowitz, a spokesman for the Abolitionist Action 
Committee.  "This year we will celebrate these victories and continue to 
educate the public about why the death penalty is a bad public policy."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Starvin' for Justice" runs from 12am Wednesday, June 29 through midnight 
Saturday, July 2 - four days of activities commemorating the historic 1972 
and 1976 Supreme Court rulings that suspended the death penalty in the 
United States and later allowed executions to resume.  At a noon hour rally 
on June 29 and in "teach-ins" each evening, speakers will address various 
perspectives on the issue.  Prominent among the speakers will be David 
Kaczynski, brother of the Unabomber, Dale Recinella, a leading Catholic 
theologian, and Diann Rust-Tierney, executive director of the National 
Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 29 marks the 33rd anniversary of the Furman v. Georgia decision 
suspending executions, while July 2 marks the 29th anniversary of the Gregg 
v. Georgia ruling allowing executions to resume.  Since Gregg, 972 people 
have been executed in the United States, with another execution scheduled 
to take place June 30, during the course of the four day protest.  This is 
the twelfth year in a row that the Abolitionist Action Committee has held 
its annual Fast and Vigil between the dates of these two landmark decisions.  Activists, many of whom are fasting the entire four 
days, are travelling to Washington D.C. from across the United States and 
beyond.  Others are fasting and holding solidarity events throughout the 
United States and beyond.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlights of this highly visual and interactive annual event include live 
music and talks by death row survivors, victims family members, and noted 
activists.  Please see details at <a href="http://www.abolition.org/starvin12.html" target="_new">http://www.abolition.org/starvin12.html
