<p>WASHINGTON - November 22 - The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN) 
strongly condemned the State Department's waiver of newly legislated 
restrictions on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia. The Department 
announced today that "it is in the national security interests of the 
United States to waive conditionality pertaining to Foreign Military 
Financing (FMF) and defense exports to Indonesia." The restriction was 
contained in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2006, which became public law only last week.

<p>In response, ETAN has issued the following statement:

<p>ETAN condemns in the strongest terms possible the State Department's 
issuance of a national security wavier that removes all congressional 
restrictions on military assistance for Indonesia. U.S. support for an 
unreformed military which remains above the law is not in the interest of 
the United States or Indonesia. This is a profoundly disappointing and sad 
day for human rights protections everywhere but especially in Indonesia, 
Timor-Leste, and the U.S.

<p>Not even two weeks ago, Congress sent a clear message to the Indonesian 
government and security forces that it expected real improvements in 
military reform, human rights protections, and accountability for crimes 
against humanity and other serious crimes before FMF could be provided and 
lethal equipment exported to Indonesia. Secretary Rice has completely 
undermined that message and undermined congressional intent by doing so.

<p>The State Department's action is simply a transparent abuse of discretion 
granted to the executive by Congress.

<p>The State Department's statement said today, "The U.S. remains committed to 
pressing for accountability for past human rights violations, and U.S. 
assistance will continue to be guided by Indonesia's progress on democratic 
reform and accountability" could not ring more hollow.  With what leverage 
will the State Department press for accountability?  The Bush 
administration just gave all remaining leverage away.

<p>With the stroke of a pen, Secretary Rice and President Bush betrayed the 
untold tens of thousands of victims of the Indonesian military's brutality 
in Indonesia and Timor-Leste and undermined efforts at democratic reform.

<p>For more background see http://etan.org/issues/miltie.htm.

<p>ETAN advocates for democracy, justice and human rights for East Timor and 
Indonesia. ETAN calls for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes 
against humanity committed in East Timor from 1975 to 1999 and for 
continued restrictions on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia until there 
is genuine reform of its security forces.
