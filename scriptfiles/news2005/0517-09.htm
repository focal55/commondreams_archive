<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 17 -- The House ethics process has been mired in a partisan fight this year, resulting in a standstill in the House Ethics Committee. Watchdog groups are now calling for an independent counsel to investigate allegations against Representative DeLay, and, for the long term, the implementation of an independent ethics commission to resolve House ethics matters in an unbiased, non-partisan manner.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moving Ideas just released a report, &quot;House Ethics Process Mired in Partisan Politics&quot; (<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/ethics.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/ethics.htm</a>),<br>that provides a guide to the House ethics fight this year and the campaign to take partisanship out of the ethics process. The report includes links to reports and analysis from policy experts as well as ways to get involved.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The House ethics fight this year clearly demonstrates that a partisan ethics process does not work,&quot; asserts Moving Ideas Managing Editor Diane Greenhalgh. &quot;We need to encourage House leaders to establish an independent ethics commission so that members of Congress are held accountable for unethical behavior regardless of which party is in power.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After immense pressure, House Republicans recently reversed a new ethics rule that would have made investigating ethics complaints much more difficult. The partisan fight has been heavily tied to ethics allegations against House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) and his influence over the ethics process. Congressional watchdog groups are calling for an independent counsel to investigate ethics allegations against DeLay.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Ethics Committee now turns its attention to allegations against DeLay, research by Congressional watchdogs has shown that a significant majority of Republicans have financial ties to DeLay -- DeLay's PAC has contributed to 225 of 232 Republican House members -- and that two members of the Ethics Committee have even donated to his legal defense fund. As a result, Ethics Committee members Tom Cole (R-OK) and Lamar Smith (R-TX) recused themselves from investigations of DeLay. Because of DeLay's influence in the House, watchdog groups are calling for Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) to appoint an independent counsel to conduct an unbiased investigation into ethics allegations against DeLay.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Watchdog groups have also used this opportunity to call for long-term solutions that take partisanship out of the ethics process, such as establishing an independent ethics commission to investigate ethics complaints.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;House Ethics Process Mired in Partisan Politics&quot; is available at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/ethics.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/ethics.htm</a>. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located in Moving Ideas' Progressive Policy Experts Database at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>As the leading source for easily searched and sorted progressive policy information, Moving Ideas provides the background information for citizen activism via the Internet.
