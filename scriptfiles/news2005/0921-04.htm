<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 21 - Congressman Richard Pombo (R-CA) is pushing forward with his longstanding agenda to gut the Endangered Species Act, America's safety net for fish and wildlife at the edge of extinction.  His bill, H.R. 3824 which has a hearing before the House Resources Committee today and a committee vote scheduled for tomorrow, would rob American children of their natural birthright, abandon conservation principles that have been around since Theodore Roosevelt was President, and take America backwards to a time when the loss of healthy fish and wildlife populations was considered a reasonable cost of doing business.

<P>Knowing the depth of the American people's support for conserving their fish, wildlife and outdoor heritage, Congressman Pombo has tried to spin his efforts as ones to improve the Endangered Species Act.  However, a close look at his legislation shows that his bill would turn back 30 years of successful stewardship and cripple the ability of the American people to safeguard the nation's fish, wildlife and special places.

<P>Congressman Pombo's legislation would:

<P>1) Eliminate habitat conservation measures on tens of millions of acres of land around the country, the "critical habitat" of species facing extinction, and prevent such conservation activities in the future. Analysis of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service data shows that species with critical habitat are more likely to be increasing in number and heading towards recovery than species without by a 2:1 margin.  If Congressman Pombo's bill becomes law, animals such as the Peninsular bighorn sheep and wild salmon will be guaranteed less room to roam and be less likely to recover.

<P>2) Repeal established conservation measures that prohibit the killing or injuring of hundreds of threatened species, such as the bald eagle.

<P>3) Create a new entitlement program by requiring the federal government to pay developers, the oil industry and polluters to avoid destroying the habitat of publicly owned fish and wildlife.

<P>Representative Pombo is being particularly disingenuous by claiming that the Endangered Species Act is not working.  Of all the fish, plants and wildlife ever conserved under the law 99 percent have been saved from becoming extinct and lost forever.  There are ways, of course, to make the law even more effective, but incentives and other strategies to aid wildlife recovery should complement, not eliminate the existing programs
with a proven track record of success.   What Rep. Pombo is proposing will
take us one step forward and ten steps backward.

<P>This attempt to rewrite the landmark law is just the latest attempt by Rep. Pombo to undermine America's bedrock environmental protections. In addition to his assault on the Endangered Species Act, he's also working to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act, and pushing controversial measures to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off America's coasts.

<P>Americans believe it is the responsibility of this generation to leave future generations a natural heritage richer than that which we have enjoyed, and that we should be good stewards of the creation with which we have been entrusted.  Congressman Pombo's bill does neither of these things but instead seeks to consign American children to a future with more strip malls than salmon runs and more freeways than fox dens.
