The Freedom Cinema Festival is at the center of the new political cinema movement, creating a meeting place for this work, giving the industry a way to access the artists and their work directly.''</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">''The Freedom Cinema Festival was the best thing about Park City during the 2004 Sundance Film Festival,'' said Mark Achbar, Director, 'The Corporation&#146; winner, 2004 Sundance Audience Award World Cinema Documentary.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">''If there was a prize for 'Best Vibe' they would surely have won. There was a consciousness in all the organizers' choices that did not pervade the larger festival down the street.
