<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->NEW YORK - November 3 - The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN) today 
praised congressional conferees for agreeing to maintain some restrictions 
on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia in the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006. The Conference 
Report was filed yesterday.

<p>"The Indonesian military is still a long way off from constituting a 
professional institution respectful of human rights and fully accountable 
to civilian authority. We are very pleased that Congress recognizes this," 
said Karen Orenstein, National Coordinator of ETAN. "U.S. restrictions on 
military assistance provide key leverage to support justice for the people 
of East Timor and Indonesia and must be maintained."

<p>The Senate-House of Representatives conference committee agreed to continue 
restrictions on Foreign Military Finance (FMF) and export of "lethal" 
military equipment to Indonesia until certain conditions, similar to those 
initially passed by the Senate, are met. These conditions include 
prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations and 
implementation of reforms to enhance civilian control of the military. The 
House version of the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill would have 
removed all restrictions on military assistance.  The final bill makes an 
exception for the Indonesian navy, providing $1 million in FMF.

<p>The legislation also requires a detailed report on U.S. and Indonesian 
efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the ambush and murder of 
two U.S. citizens and an Indonesian in West Papua on August 31, 2002. The 
Senate version of the bill would have withheld International Military 
Education and Training until the report was issued.

<p>The conferees further directed the Secretary of State to submit a report on 
troop deployments and humanitarian and human rights conditions in West 
Papua and Aceh, Indonesia's most repressed provinces. This reporting would 
include "the extent to which members of Indonesia's security forces support 
these [jihadist-oriented] militia," and "the extent to which international 
funding for reconstruction in Aceh is being contracted or subcontracted to 
firms controlled by or affiliated with the Indonesian military." The report 
was part of the Senate version of the bill.

<p>"Unfortunately, any U.S. assistance will be viewed by the still unreformed 
and intensely corrupt Indonesian military as an endorsement of 
business-as-usual, not as a reward for very modest reforms. The navy, like 
the other elements of Indonesia's security forces, remains largely 
unaccountable for many human rights violations. It has a notably grisly 
record in West Papua," said Orenstein.

<p>In September, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops called for 
placing human rights conditions on military assistance to Indonesia, as 
have many other religious leaders and members of Congress not participating 
in the conference committee.  Representatives of 48 human rights, 
faith-based, arms control and peace groups also wrote to Congress urging 
continued restriction of military assistance.

<p>"We especially thank Senator Leahy and Representative Lowey for resolutely 
ensuring that Congress continues to act as the government's conscience in 
supporting peace and justice in Indonesia and East Timor," Orenstein stated.

<p>The bill earmarks $19 million in Economic Support Funds for East Timor and 
$5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in police training for Indonesia 
and East Timor.

<p>ETAN advocates for democracy, justice and human rights for East Timor and 
Indonesia. ETAN calls for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes 
against humanity committed in East Timor from 1975 to 1999 and for 
continued restrictions on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia until there 
is genuine reform of its security forces.
