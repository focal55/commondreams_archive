<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->GENEVA, Switzerland - September 8 -  Greenpeace, today, accused the 
International Atomic Energy Agency of deliberately trying to down play 
the death toll of the Chernobyl accident as part of the nuclear 
industry's continued attempt to portray itself as an acceptable future 
energy source.

<p>During a two-day conference in Vienna, the Agency presented a report 
claiming that ultimately some 4,000 deaths can be expected as a result 
of the world's worst nuclear accident at Chernobyl in 1986. According to 
the IAEA "fewer than 50 deaths had been directly attributed to radiation 
from the disaster," to date. The IAEA study does not cover all of the 
populations affected by Chernobyl fall-out but merely considers those 
who received a high radiation dose in the immediate wake of the accident 
- namely those 'liquidators' drafted in to carry out the immediate clean 
up of the site.

<p>However, at the IAEA hosted conference another UN body, The World Health 
Organisation (WHO), produced its own report, showing that the death toll 
would be over 8,000 if the local population around the stricken reactor 
where included. WHO also estimates from a study of some 76,000 
'liquidators' that 216, and not 50, died by 1998.

<p>Neither UN body takes into account the hundreds of millions of Europeans 
exposed to low doses of radioactivity as a result of the cloud of 
contamination which spread throughout Europe from Chernobyl.

<p>Statements from the IAEA that many of the illnesses previously ascribed 
to Chernobyl fall out in earlier scientific studies can not be 
attributed to radiation exposure but are simply the consequence of 
'stress and irrational fear' are highly misleading and unjustified the 
international environmental organisation said.

<p>"It is appalling that the IAEA is whitewashing the impacts of one of the 
most serious industrial accident in human history. It is a deliberate 
attempt to minimize the risks of nuclear power in order to free the way 
for new reactor construction," said Jan Vande Putte, Greenpeace 
International nuclear campaigner.

<p>The IAEA stated at the conference that previous researchers who have 
estimated the number of deaths in the range of tens of thousands to 
hundreds of thousands have exaggerated the impacts. When questioned 
about the confusing figures presented at the conference, Mr. Bennet - 
chair of the Chernobyl Forum - confirmed that "the 4,000 figure was up 
in the air and was a very rough scoping estimate". The WHO report on 
which he contributed also confirms that "the actual number of deaths 
caused by this accident is unlikely to ever be precisely known"

<p>"As we approach the 20th anniversary of the world worst nuclear 
accident, the victims of Chernobyl deserve more than this shoddy, 
incomplete and contradictory science. What they need is real science and 
real solutions to the continued suffering and ill-health brought about 
by the Chernobyl disaster," said Jan Vande Putte.

<p>It is clear from the papers presented at the IAEA conference that not 
all affected populations have been included in the studies or the 
estimated death tolls. Greenpeace calls upon the UN and the 
international community to rectify these omissions as a matter of 
urgency and responsibility should be removed from the pro-nuclear IAEA.


<p>Notes to Editor:

<p>WHO correctly refers in its report to 2 different approaches to assess 
the health impacts of radiation:
The first  - and the most accepted approach by nuclear regulators 
worldwide - is based on the standards set by the International 
Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and which assumes that 
there is a linear relationship between radiation dose and effect, 
without a threshold. This means that if a very large population is 
subjected to a very low dose, the collective impact can still be very 
serious. In the case of the Chernobyl accident, this leads to estimates 
in the range of tens to hundreds of thousands of casualties. (Euratom: 
Directive 96/29/Euratom)

<p>The other approach is based on epidemiology and tries to report the 
actual number of casualties and use statistical methods to estimate the 
total number of casualties for a population. This approach is valuable 
in well controlled situations, but can become very problematic in 
complex situations such as in Europe, where it will be absolutely 
impossible to relate individual cases of cancer e.g. in Belgium or 
France, to the Chernobyl fallout. (WHO, Low doses of radiation linked to 
small increase in cancer risk.

release from the IAEA, WHO and UNDP.
