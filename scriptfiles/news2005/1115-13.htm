<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 15  - <p><i>Statement by Eli Pariser, Executive Director of MoveOn.org Political Action:

 

</i>
<p>“Today’s Senate votes on Iraq are an important step towards getting away from the failed Bush policy of “Staying the Course” and towards brining our troops home. Both the Democratic legislation (the Levin amendment) and the Republican legislation (the Warner-Frist alternative) recognize that the Bush administration does not have a plan for getting us out of Iraq, and turns up the heat on the president to come up with one. 

 

<p>“The difference between the Democratic and Republican proposals is very real. Republicans are posturing for political points. The Democrats have a plan for how to get America out of Iraq that includes the important promise that America won’t be in Iraq indefinitely. Democrats also support timelines so there is accountability for what happens in Iraq. Americans know what timelines and deadlines are. They face them every day in their lives at work, in school and at home. The Democratic Iraq policy is an important step towards changing the course in Iraq. 

 

<p>“MoveOn members -- like most Americans -- believe we need an exit strategy with a timeline that starts now. That's why MoveOn members are calling their Senators to either thank them or share their disappointment about this vote.”
