<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- For the second time in recent weeks, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) is facing serious new allegations that he violated House ethics rules.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thursday's Washington Post raises questions about a foreign junket taken by DeLay, his wife and other GOP House members that was reportedly paid for by a registered foreign agent. House rules prohibit a &quot;foreign principal&quot; or registered lobbyist from paying the travel expenses for Members or staff. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tab for the 2001 trip to South Korea was paid for by the Korea-U.S. Exchange Council, &quot;a business-financed entity created with help from a lobbying firm headed by DeLay's former chief of staff,&quot; according to the Post.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an especially telling remark in the story, Jan Baran, a respected GOP lawyer and former general counsel to the Republican National Committee, called Delay's trip &quot;a problem,&quot; and said the questions raised about it should trigger an investigation by the Ethics Committee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Wednesday that &quot;DeLay was more actively involved than previously known in gathering corporate donations for a political committee that is the focus of a grand-jury investigation in Texas, his home state.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month it was reported that DeLay took a golf trip in 2000 to Scotland paid for by lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who is embroiled in an investigation that he allegedly bilked more than $80 million from six Indian tribe clients in public relations and lobbying fees.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DeLay is fast accumulating a laundry list of allegations that demand the attention of the Ethics Committee, which is already well acquainted with him. Last year, the panel admonished him three times for his conduct.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause will continue to urge for an investigation and sound the call for DeLay to step down as majority leader.  He is ethically unfit to lead Congress.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
