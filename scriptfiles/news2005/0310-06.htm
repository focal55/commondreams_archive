<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- On January 27, FAIR issued an action alert on the New York Times' and AP's use of the White House-friendly phrase &quot;personal accounts&quot; to describe Bush's privatization plan. On March 6, Times public editor Daniel Okrent devoted part of his column<br>(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/weekinreview/06bott.html" target="_new">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/weekinreview/06bott.html</a>) to responding to FAIR activists and others on this issue. FAIR replied in its online Media Views feature, a daily compendium of media criticism and analysis (<a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2039" target="_new">http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2039</a>).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okrent's comment was:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now a rugby scrum has gathered around the Bush Social Security plan. Republicans tout 'personal accounts'; Democrats trash 'private accounts.' In this atmosphere, I don't think reporters have much choice other than to use 'private' and 'personal' interchangeably, and to interchange them often. Once one side of an ideological conflict has seized control of a word, it no longer has a meaning of its own; opting for one or the other would be a declaration that doesn't belong in the news reports.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And FAIR responded:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Private accounts&quot; was the accurate term used by both sides of the debate until Republicans realized it wasn't polling well; they then started calling them &quot;personal accounts,&quot; a deceptive term because citizens already have personal Social Security accounts that keep track of their individual contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Okrent, the media should use this inaccurate PR term interchangeably with the old terminology because words have no meanings other than those given to them by political partisans--an odd stance for the Times' public editor to take.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
