<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MOSCOW, Russia – Greenpeace today published evidence 
that consumers and food producers in Poland and Russia have become 
strong opponents against genetically engineered (GE) food. In Poland, an 
opinion poll commissioned by Greenpeace shows that 76% of Polish 
consumers do not wish to eat food products that contain GE ingredients, 
such as GE soya and GE maize (1). The Russian Consumers’ Guide (2) 
reveals more than 450 food companies in the country that have adopted a 
GE free policy, among them are well known international brand names, 
such as Nestlé and Coca-Cola.
<P>The data reinforces earlier reports of consumer rejection of GE food, 
such as the study by the European Commission showing that only 14% of 
the European population believes that GE food is safe (3). “Consumers all over Europe, east and west, are applying common sense and 
rejecting the genetic experiment with their food,” said Geert Ritsema of 
Greenpeace International GE campaigner.
<P>Greenpeace also published a statement by the Russian Soy Union stating 
that at present there is no commercial production of GE soya on Russian 
territory and that the Union “supports a moratorium on the cultivation 
of transgenic soya in Russia” (4).
<P>Maciej Muskat, Greenpeace Central Eastern Europe campaigner in Poland 
said: “The food industry has to respect the wishes of Polish consumers 
and take risky and unwanted GE products off the shelves.”
Some international retailers, who operate in Poland, such as the French 
Géant, have double standards. In Western Europe they have a GE free 
policy, but in Poland their consumers get no such guarantees. “Such 
double standards for GE food are inexplicable and unacceptable. 
Companies must act immediately and apply the same policy across the 
whole of Europe,” said Muskat.
<P>Greenpeace will also step up its campaign against GE food in Russia. 
Over the last ten months the environmental organisation managed to get 
40 Russian food companies to commit to a GE free policy. However, there 
are still more than 500 companies on the Russian red list in the market. 
Greenpeace will continue to put pressure on these companies to change 
their GE policy. Natalia Olefirenko of Greenpeace Russia said: “The 
Russian Consumer’s Guide will be mailed free of charge to every Russian 
citizen who contacts Greenpeace.”
<P>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force the solutions that are essential to a green and 
peaceful future.

<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WASHINGTON - Commercial Alert sent a letter today to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requesting it to investigate whether buzz marketers are violating federal law prohibiting deceptive advertising. The letter asks the FTC to review evidence that “companies are perpetrating large-scale deception upon consumers by deploying buzz marketers who fail to disclose that they have been enlisted to promote products. This failure to disclose is fundamentally fraudulent and misleading.”
<p>Commercial Alert’s letter urges the FTC to thoroughly investigate Proctor & Gamble’s Tremor, which has enlisted about 250,000 teenagers in its buzz marketing sales force. “The Commission should carefully examine the targeting of minors by buzz marketing, because children and teenagers tend to be more impressionable and easy to deceive. The Commission should do this, at a minimum, by issuing subpoenas to executives at Proctor & Gamble’s Tremor and other buzz marketers that target children and teenagers, to determine whether their endorsers are disclosing that they are paid marketers.”
<p>The letter states “Buzz marketing also is known as ‘guerrilla,’ or ‘stealth’ marketing. The terms are significant because they suggest the subterfuge that corporations are working on the buying public. They often are not promoting products and services openly, the way conventional advertising does. Rather they are enlisting people to promote products under the guise of doing something else….The Federal Trade Commission should require any and all persons who are paid to engage in such practices to disclose their relationship to the corporation whose products they are pitching, including their compensation. Failure to provide such disclosure should be considered ‘unfair or deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce’ within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act.”
<p>The full text of Commercial Alert’s letter to the FTC is available at: <a href="http://www.commercialalert.org/buzzmarketing.pdf">http://www.commercialalert.org/buzzmarketing.pdf</a>.

<p>Commercial Alert is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to keep the commercial culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental integrity and democracy.
