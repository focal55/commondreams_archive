<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - The national Win Without War coalition praised House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s endorsement of Congressman John Murtha’s plan for a U.S. military exit from Iraq, calling it an important step on the road out of Iraq.   The coalition’s National Director, former U.S. Congressman Tom Andrews called on Win Without War members to urge their representatives in Congress to join Pelosi and Murtha and demand a debate on the Bush policy in Iraq.

 

<p>“Today’s endorsement by the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives for a U.S. military exit from Iraq is an important step out of a deadline quagmire,” Andrews said.  “It builds on the momentum started by Congressman Murtha to end the war and bring our troops home in 2006. It deserves a strong positive response from all House members, starting with the members of Democratic Caucus. We urge members of Congress to join Minority Leader Pelosi and Congressman Murtha.

 

<p>“Congress has failed the nation by failing to hold President Bush and the administration accountable for the disaster in Iraq. Congresswoman Pelosi’s stand creates the opportunity for a genuine debate in the Halls of Congress on the U.S. military occupation on Iraq – a debate that has so far been denied the American people,” said Andrews. 

 

<p>House Democrats have scheduled a caucus next week exclusively on Iraq.  

 

<p>“Now is the time for Congress to hear from their constituents and demand an end to a disastrous policy that strengthens the Iraq insurgency, empowers terrorist organizations and makes America less safe. The majority of Americans and an even stronger majority of Iraqis want the U.S. military out of Iraq,” said Andrews.  

 

<p>“It is time for Congress to do the right thing and demand that the administration offer a candid admission of a failed policy and the distortions that preceded it, the unambiguous announcement that the U.S. will not maintain permanent military bases there, and the immediate initiation of a coherent plan for the withdrawal of our forces in 2006.”
