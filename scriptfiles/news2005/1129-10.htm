<p>WASHINGTON - November 29 -  The Human Rights Campaign praised the State Department for releasing a written statement condemning the United Arab Emirates’ arrest of two dozen individuals at a purported gay wedding and threats of forced psychological and hormonal treatment, according to news reports.

<p>“The State Department’s condemnation of these arrests and threats is an important component of resolving this atrocious episode,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people are in every country in this world and should be afforded the same dignity and respect that every human being deserves. The United States should support a resolution in front of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights acknowledging that sexual orientation and gender identity protections are part of internationally recognized human rights standards. Unfortunately, our government has not yet supported such a move.”

<p>The State Department statement, which was released Nov. 28, called on “the government of the United Arab Emirates to immediately stop any ordered hormone and psychological treatment and to comply with the standards of international law.” <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2005/57390.htm">Read the statement</a>.

<p>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
