<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 18 -- Eleven teenagers from the Florida Keys traveled to the nation's capital this week and secured new interest in co-sponsorship for the Climate Stewardship Act, legislation that would start reducing heat- trapping pollution generated by the United States and help prevent further damage from global warming to South Florida's vulnerable environment. After the teens' visits, several Congressional offices announced that they are reviewing their positions. The students are members of World Wildlife Fund's Team Panda. In two days on Capitol Hill, the students met with staff from twenty-nine Senate and House offices.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Scientists agree that is it critically important for us to reduce the emissions that cause global warming,&quot; said Hans Verolme, Director of World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Program. &quot;The Climate Stewardship Act is a good start towards a secure future for all of us, and Team Panda did a powerful job helping build support for it.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students insisted on taking action after learning about the threats global warming poses to south Florida. In the last century sea level in south Florida rose between seven and nine inches, and is expected to rise by another eighteen to twenty this century, due in large part to global warming.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It doesn't sound like much until you learn that with only 40 inches of sea level rise the entire Florida Keys and Everglades will be under water,&quot; said 15-year-old Courtney Rudacille.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Team Panda spent the past several months interviewing Florida Keys dive shop operators, tropical fish collectors and underwater photographers who said that they had already witnessed global warming's impacts.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the years that ocean temperatures have been at their highest, due to global climate change,&quot; said freshman Katie Greenman, &quot;the Keys have experienced devastating episodes of coral bleaching that have killed parts of the reef.&quot; &quot;The coral reefs and my home are in danger,&quot; worried 17-year-old Kelley Greenman, &quot;and may be gone before my grandchildren ever get a chance to see them.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I went to Washington to lobby Congress because this is the most important issue facing the Keys,&quot; said student Jennifer Zimmerman. &quot;It was exciting, getting to do something that not many people do. And I felt like I was helping to make a difference.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Team Panda also recently testified before the United States Coral Reef Task Force and the Advisory Council of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary on climate change and south Florida. The students who lobbied Congress this week were: Jennifer Zimmerman, Kelley Greenman, Courtney Rudacille, Alana Vassil, Arielle Taylor-Manges, Ruby Beilik, Katie Greenman, Alden Glinert, Andrew Vassil, Chris Garrett and Suzie Greenman.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHOTO EDITORS:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A high resolution, publication-ready photograph supporting this story is available for free editorial use at: <a href="http://www.wirepix.com/cgi-bin/newsphotos/download.cgi?image=USN031805cc.%20j%20p%20g" target="_new">http://www.wirepix.com/cgi-bin/newsphotos/download.cgi?image=USN031805cc. j p g</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An archive of this and more than 1,000 news photos is available at: <a href="http://www.wirepix.com/newsphotos/" target="_new">http://www.wirepix.com/newsphotos/ </a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
