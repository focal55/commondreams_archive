<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 1 -- A Media Matters for America Flash animation was awarded a coveted Pollie Award for excellence in political communications by the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC). Media Matters' &quot;The Right-Wing Squares,&quot; produced by JulianMulvey.com, earned the Bronze Award in Web Animation. &quot;The Right-Wing Squares&quot; features animated caricatures of right-wing pundits delivering a blizzard of conservative misinformation in their own words.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are pleased that the AAPC recognized both our efforts and the efforts of julianmulvey.com,&quot; said David Brock, President and CEO of Media Matters for America. &quot;But more importantly, we are encouraged that the content of 'The Right-Wing Squares' reached a broad audience and is effectively exposing the divisive rhetoric being injected into the media by some right-wing pundits.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Right-Wing Squares&quot; uses actual audio clips of claims made by right-wing pundits. Featured pundits include Rush Limbaugh, who said women &quot;actually wish&quot; to be sexually harassed; Michael Savage, who said lesbians are &quot;jealous&quot; of AIDS; and Bill O'Reilly, who called poor people &quot;irresponsible and lazy.&quot; It was created for the launch of Media Matters Action Network, a sister organization of Media Matters for America, to get people involved in the media monitoring process as part of our efforts to hold the media accountable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To view &quot;The Right-Wing Squares,&quot; please visit <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/static/right-wing-squares.html" target="_new">http://www.mediamatters.org/static/right-wing-squares.html</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Media Matters for America is a Web-based, not-for-profit, progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.
