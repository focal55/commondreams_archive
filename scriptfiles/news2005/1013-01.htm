<p>SAN RAFAEL, California - While fisherwoman Diane Wilson evades a minor misdemeanor to prove her point, US Multinational evades criminal trial for manslaughter in India over the 1984 Bhopal Chemical Disaster.

<p>On Oct 3rd, District Attorney of Texas ordered Diane Wilson to start a jail sentence for criminal trespass resulting from chaining herself to a 70 foot tower to hang a banner at the Dow Chemical plant to demand justice for Bhopal Survivors.

<p>WHO:<br> 
Diane Wilson is a fourth generation Texas fisherwoman, activist and author of the new book, An Unreasonable Woman. She is insisting that Dow Chemical, the new owner of Union Carbide, be accountable to Americans for polluting the bays along the Gulf Coast of Texas. She is now aligned with the survivors of the Bhopal disaster to gain accountability for the devastation that continues in their community from Dow Chemicalâ€™s negligence in addressing criminal liability and environmental cleanup related to the December, 1984 chemical disaster and continuing to the present.

<p>WHAT:<br> 
Diane Wilson is a keynote speaker at Bioneers conference in Northern California. She will discuss her refusal to serve her jail sentence until Dow Chemical Subsidiary Union Carbide and former Carbide CEO Warren Anderson appear in India courts for manslaughter and other charges brought by the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court of Bhopal, India.

<p>WHEN: <br>
Friday, October 14, 2005 at 12:30PM 

<p>WHERE: <br>
Bioneers conference in the Marin Center 10 Avenue of the Flags San Rafael CA 94903 (link for directions: <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/conference/logistics02.php" target="_new">http://www.bioneers.org/conference/logistics02.php</a> 

<p>WHY:  <br>
On December 3rd, 1984, the company Union Carbide, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Chemical, caused the greatest industrial tragedy in history, when a chemical leak, caused by cutbacks on safety, killed thousands of people living in Bhopal, India.

<p>To date, the CEO of the company at the time, Warren Anderson, has not been brought to trial.  A very meager compensation package has slowly been finding its way to the people of Bhopal.

<p>Diane Wilson learned about Dow as she fished for shrimp in the Gulf of Texas, near the Seadrift Dow plant and other chemical plants such as Formosa Plastics. An EPA release inventory list showed that her county of Calhoun, Texas was number one in the nation for toxic disposal. Diane realized that the struggle for a healthy environment in Bhopal was the same as her own.

<p>For more details on Diane's current action:<br>
A video news release with interview footage of Diane is available for internet download, or express shipment of broadcast quality data DVD.  View or request the release on the web at:  <a href="http://dianewilson.strategicvideo.net">http://dianewilson.strategicvideo.net</a><br>
