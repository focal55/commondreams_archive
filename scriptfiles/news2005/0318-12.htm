<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK -- March 18 -- As the world marks the second anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq this weekend protesters will be out worldwide and hundreds of war critics will be holding house parties and community screenings of Danny Schechter's new film, <a href="http://www.wmdthefilm.com/mambo/index.php" target="_new">WMD (Weapons of Mass Deception)</a>.  WMD challenges the role played by major media outlets in misreporting and cheerleading for the war.<br> <br>At least 400 such events in 262 cities are taking place worldwide from Maui to Manhattan to Glasgow, Scotland to discuss how to improve media coverage. Major media outlets including the Washington Post, New York Times and three network news presidents have admitted and apologized for flawed coverage.<br> <br>&quot;Apologies and mea culpas are not enough,&quot; says former network newsman and media critic Danny Schechter, director of WMD.  &quot;News executives have been fired for far lesser offenses. This film and the movement it has spawned is demanding more diversity of coverage and more accurate reporting.&quot;<br> <br>House parties like this have blossomed into a new distribution model for hard-hitting documentaries.  A DVD version is widely distributed by grassroots networks to supplement TV and theatrical screenings.<br> <br>For more information, to get a DVD for review, or to interview Danny Schechter, call David DeGraw at 212-246-0202 x3005 or email <a href="mailto:David@WMDtheFilm.com" target="_new">David@WMDtheFilm.com</a>.
