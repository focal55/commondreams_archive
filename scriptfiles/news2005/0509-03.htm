<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 9 -- The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) today praised Rep. Mark Souder (R-3-Ind.) and Rep. Brian Baird (D-3-Wash.) and the 76 other members of Congress who last week sent a letter to the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee seeking much-needed funding for America's national parks.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This letter illustrates the strong, bipartisan support for increased national park funding as Congress prepares the parks' fiscal year 2006 budget,&quot; said NPCA President Tom Kiernan.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter that Rep. Souder and Rep. Baird sponsored was signed by a total of 78 members of Congress, and requested an additional $100 million over the president's request for the fiscal year 2006 operations of the national parks.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As the committee knows, this request is extremely modest compared to the need. While the National Park Service's operating budget has increased in recent years, it has failed to keep pace with the increasing demands placed on our parks,&quot; the congressmen wrote.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii) sponsored a similar letter in the U.S. Senate, which was signed by 36 members, and delivered last week to the Senate Interior Appropriations subcommittee.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March, Rep. Souder and Rep. Baird and a bipartisan group of co-sponsors introduced the National Park Centennial Act, a bill that would fund the needs of the national parks for the next decade. Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), Ken Salazar (D-Colo.), and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced the Centennial Act in the U.S. Senate in April.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>NPCA's new report, Faded Glory: Top 10 Reasons to Reinvest in America's National Park Heritage, points out that the annual operating budget of the national parks is short more than $600 million annually, limiting the ability of the Park Service to address poaching and drug smuggling, repair unsafe roads and trails, conduct wildlife research and monitoring, restore crumbling historic buildings, and provide sufficient educational programs for school groups and park visitors.</i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Faded Glory is available online at <a href="http:www.npca.org/report/investinparks.asp" target="_new">http:www.npca.org/report/investinparks.asp</a></i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
