<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - July 18 - Inside the meeting, shareholders and advocacy groups press TIAA-CREF officers to explain several governance scandals in the past year and its  investment in some socially irresponsible companies; demonstrators  outside the building take their case to the public.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As corporate scandals continue to rock Wall Street, the  nation&#146;s largest pension fund is once again coming under fire from the  Make TIAA-CREF Ethical coalition.* At the CREF annual shareholders&#146;  meeting July 19, advocacy groups are joining shareholders to demand  greater accountability from TIAA-CREF, the $350 billion pension fund for  educators and researchers. As demonstrators picket outside TIAA-CREF  headquarters with banners, placards, and costumes, shareholders will speak up  inside the annual meeting. Two years ago, at an annual meeting also  held in New York, TIAA-CREF Chair and CEO Herbert Allison was pounded by  shareholders for his exorbitant salary. Now shareholders want to know  why the self-proclaimed governance leader is itself coming under  scrutiny. After SEC complaints, two trustees had to be removed because of  financial conflicts of interest. Additionally, their CFO, now on a leave of  absence, is under investigation by the SEC and DOJ for practices in her  previous job. Finally, after doing an insufficient background check,  they hired a criminal, resulting in a breech in security and a subsequent  lack of candor about events surrounding her removal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Says activist and coalition representative Jaime Lagunez, of frente  civico por la defensa del Casino de la Selva, &#147;For a group claming  leadership in governance and social responsibility, they need to look in the  mirror and recognize their own shortcomings in these areas. They need to  be more vigilant in their own corporate governance and they need to  divest from corporations involved in human rights violations and in public  health, community, and environmental degradation. Instead they need to  be investing in socially responsible ventures.&#148; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Make TIAA-CREF Ethical coalition points to contradictions between  the company&#146;s stated policies and its investments. TIAA-CREF&#146;s Policy  Statement on Corporate Governance states that &#147;TIAA-CREF believes that  building long-term shareholder value is consistent with directors giving  careful consideration to issues of social responsibility and the common  good. We recognize that efforts to promote good corporate citizenship  may serve to enhance a company&#146;s reputation and long-term economic  performance.&#148; The policy further states that companies should be concerned  with &quot;environmental impact...the corporation's communities and  constituencies... deliberate and knowing exploitation of any non-shareholder  constituencies... human rights... labor issues&#133;&#148; At the same time, notes  the coalition, TIAA-CREF invests in:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nike and Wal-Mart&#150;condemned for selling products produced by overseas  sweatshop labor </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wal-Mart &#150;widely criticized for its domestic labor practices, hurting  local businesses, and promoting urban sprawl</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unocal&#150;has business ventures with Burma&#146;s brutal government </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philip Morris/Altria&#150;responsible for Marlboro, the leading cigarette  brand among youth</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Costco&#150;promotes police brutality in Mexico and the destruction of its  cultural heritage and the environment</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coca-Cola &#150; markets nutritionally deficient products to kids at home,  tied to water shortages abroad and is complicit in gross human rights  abuses, including murder, torture and kidnapping in Colombia              (TIAA-CREF divested its harmful World Bank bonds and should state it  will buy no more.)</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Stockholders by definition are owners of a company and with ownership  comes responsibility,&quot; says Corporate Campaign, Inc./Campaign to Stop  Killer Coke director Ray Rogers.  &quot;I do not believe TIAA-CREF  participants want to be associated with the tobacco industry or companies like  Coca-Cola that are complicit in widespread human rights abuses including  kidnapping, torture, and murder;  fraudulent business practices and  undermining the health and well-being of children worldwide.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition asserts that TIAA-CREF must divest from these companies  immediately or engage in transparent attempts to influence them to  change their behaviors. It is calling for TIAA-CREF to set a deadline to  divest from the companies if they do not make sufficient changes. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to coalition group representative Neil Wollman, a professor  at Manchester College in Indiana, TIAA-CREF&#146;s claims that non-financial  criteria cannot affect their financial decisions is inconsistent with  their governance document. Wollman asks, &quot;Would TIAA-CREF have invested  in the production of Nazi gas chambers in World War II if it meant a  healthy financial profit? TIAA-CREF must either agree that moral issues  are relevant to investing, or they must admit that such investment is OK  with them. It's time for TIAA-CREF to answer these kinds of questions  to shareholders, stakeholders, and the media. Important moral concerns  are at stake here.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Wollman, TIAA-CREF also reneged on promises made over a  year ago that it would address the concerns of the Social Choice for  Social Change campaign, a group in the coalition that is seeking investment  in community development and other positive ventures. Wollman says that  top TIAA-CREF officers engaged in dialogue with the group for a year,  then rejected all but one request. He notes, &quot;Where is the concern for  shareholder voices that they proclaim? Where is the concern for social  and corporate responsibility they profess? How can one take seriously  their tag line, &#145;Financial Services for the Greater Good&#146;?&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Howard Zinn, a noted historian, says, &#147;I hope that more and more people  will insist that TIAA-CREF funds be invested in socially responsible  ways.&#148; University of Pittsburgh Professor Dennis Brutus, the  anti-apartheid campaigner who spent time in prison with Nelson Mandela for opposing  apartheid in South Africa, says, &#147;Not only interest, but the interests  of the people must be borne in mind when making sound and moral  decisions.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                                           TIAA-CREF July 19 Demonstration</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstration: Outside TIAA-CREF&#146;s corporate headquarters and raising  of voices inside to urge fund to divest of Costco, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola,  Nike, Unocal, Philip Morris/Altria (and pledge no reinvestment in World  Bank bonds).
