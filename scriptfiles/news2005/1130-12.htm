<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - “While today’s speech by the President was billed as yet another attempt to lay out a plan for finishing the military mission in Iraq, the only new thing the administration gave the American people was a glossy 35-page pamphlet filled with the same rhetoric we’ve all heard before.  Today’s action by the White House isn’t a step forward, it’s a step back.  In fact the booklet the administration released to accompany the President’s speech is described as a “…document [that] articulates the broad strategy the President set forth in 2003…”  That alone makes it clear that the President seems more dug in than ever to the same old “stay the course” way of thinking.  This is not a strategy, and it certainly is not a plan to complete the military mission in Iraq.  

 

<p>The American people, an increasing number of elected officials, and more and more military and intelligence officials understand what the President doesn’t - that our seemingly indefinite presence in Iraq, and the lack of a plan to redeploy troops, feeds the insurgency and hurts our national security.  We need leadership, and we need a policy on Iraq that includes a flexible timetable for completing our military mission there, so that we can focus on our national security priority – defeating the global terrorist networks that threaten the U.S.  The President missed a vital opportunity today.  Our brave service members, their families, the American people, and the Iraqi’s themselves deserve and demand more.”

 

 

<p>Feingold voted against the Iraq resolution in October 2002. In June, he introduced a resolution that called on the President to provide a flexible, public timetable for our mission in Iraq – one that is tied to clear and achievable benchmarks. In August, Feingold put forward December 31, 2006 to help jumpstart the discussion of a target date to complete the military mission there.
