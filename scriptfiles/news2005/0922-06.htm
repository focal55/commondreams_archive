<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - Sixty 
percent of movies advertised on the in-school TV program Channel One portray 
smoking, according to a new <A 
href="http://www.commercialalert.org/smokingclass.pdf">report</A> by Commercial 
Alert, titled &#8220;Smoking Class: How Schools and Channel One Promote Tobacco to 
Students.&#8221; <BR><BR>Such cinema portrayals of tobacco are highly effective in 
luring young people into the ranks of tobacco users &#8211; even more so than 
conventional advertising. It is estimated that each year smoking in movies 
recruits 390,000 new young smokers in the United States. Since January 1, 2000, 
Channel One has advertised at least 67 commercial motion pictures.&nbsp; Forty 
of these movies portray smoking.<BR><BR>Channel One is a for-profit company that 
distributes a daily commercial television program to more than 30 percent of all 
American teenagers in nearly 11,500 middle and high schools across the United 
States. <BR><BR>&#8220;Schools should never promote tobacco to students,&#8221; said Gary 
Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert, a nonprofit organization that 
protects children and communities from commercialism. &#8220;Channel One should be 
expelled from every school in the country.&#8221;<BR><BR>Tobacco is the number one 
cause of preventable deaths in the United States, causing 435,000 fatalities 
each year. Adolescents who see plenty of smoking on screen are nearly three 
times more likely to start smoking than those who see the least.&nbsp; Yet 
school administrators and politicians have invited into schools a commercial 
medium that promotes tobacco use, and then have arranged for captive audiences 
of young people to watch it. &nbsp;<BR><BR>Channel One&#8217;s airing of commercial 
messages promoting smoking contravenes the spirit and intention of many state 
laws that require schools to teach students a curriculum about the potential 
harms and legal ramifications of smoking.<BR><BR>Copies of the Smoking Class 
report are available at <A 
href="http://www.commercialalert.org/smokingclass.pdf">http://www.commercialalert.org/smokingclass.pdf</A>.<BR><BR>Commercial 
Alert is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to keep the commercial 
culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and 
subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental integrity and 
democracy.
