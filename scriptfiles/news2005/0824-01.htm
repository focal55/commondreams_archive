<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 23 -   British MP George Galloway Announces September Tour of United States to Speak Against War in Iraq
 
<p>George Galloway is Respect party MP for Bethnal Green and Bow in East London.  He recently electrified the United States with his appearance at a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on

<p>Investigations hearing on May 17, when he turned the proceedings into a condemnation of the war in Iraq. CNN's Wolf Blitzer described Galloway's speech in the Senate as "a blistering attack on US senators rarely heard" in Washington.

<p>After his speech, the New York Times noted in a July 2 profile, "His House of Commons e-mail box had to be shut down for a spell, after it buckled under the heft of thousands of messages; most came from America, and some were sent by the family members of dead and wounded soldiers."

<p>Galloway's new book is Mr. Galloway Goes to Washington (The New Press) and will be published and timed for national release in bookstores in conjunction with the tour.

<p>In the wake of the recent London bombings, one of which took place in his constituency, Mr. Galloway took to the floor of Parliament to decry the loss of innocent life, but also to warn against the anti-Muslim hysteria being created by the policies of Tony Blair¹s government.

<p>Mr. Galloway will be speaking in Boston (September 13), New York (September 14), Toronto (September 16 and 17), Madison (September 18), Chicago (September 19), Seattle (September 20), San Francisco (September 21), and Los Angeles (September 22) in the run up to the national anti-war march planned for Washington, D.C., on September 24, where he will address the march as well as speak at a large indoor event after the protest.

<p>National Tour sponsored by: The New Press, International Socialist Review, Center for Economic Research and Social Change, the National Council of Arab Americans
