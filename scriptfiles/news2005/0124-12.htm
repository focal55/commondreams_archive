<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 24 -- Today Rep. Henry A. Waxman released a report finding that over half of California's juvenile detention facilities inappropriately incarcerate youth waiting for mental health treatment.  The report reveals:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On an average night, over 250 California youth are jailed because community treatment services are not available;</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These youth are as young as eight years old;</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some have no charges of any kind pending against them; and</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estimated annual cost of inappropriate detention exceeds $10 million.</font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is dangerous, costly, and wrong to use jails as overflow for our mental health system,&quot; said Rep. Waxman.  &quot;Children who need treatment in their community should receive treatment without delay.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report examines the response from administrators in 43 juvenile detention facilities throughout California, representing a response rate of 88%.  Twenty-seven centers (representing 63% of those surveyed) reported holding youth unnecessarily because community mental health services were not available.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report includes comments from detention center administrators.  One wrote, &quot;We are overwhelmed by the sheer number of mentally challenged youth that we must deal with.&quot;  Another stated, &quot;Children should not be housed in jail or juvenile detention to wait for services.  There are not enough services for the many needs that we have.&quot;  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report finds that inappropriately held youth in California stay in detention for an average of 64 days, more than twice the average time spent by California youth as a whole and three times the average time spent by juvenile detainees nationally.  Approximately one in eight youth incarcerated inappropriately in the nation each night waits in a California facility.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complete report is available at <a href="http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov" target="_new">http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov</a>.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
