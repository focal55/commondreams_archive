<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - August 11 -  The Peace Action Committee of the Green Party of the United States has issued a statement of support for Cindy Sheehan, co-founder of Gold Star Families For Peace, in her vigil near the vacation home of President George W. Bush in Crawford, Texas.  The text of the statement follows below.

<p>Ms. Sheehan is the mother of Casey Sheehan, who was killed in combat in Sadr City in 2004, a few days after arriving in Iraq.  Over 1,800 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of  Iraqi civilians have been killed in the U.S. invasion and occupation.

<p>Greens called Ms. Sheehan's protest a unique challenge to all Americans to speak out against the Bush Administration's betrayal of the trust of the American people and reckless disregard for American and Iraqi lives.

<p>"The Bush Administration betrayed the trust of the American people, especially those serving in the armed forces in Iraq, when it launched a war based on fraudulent premises: WMDs that didn't exist, forged evidence of nuclear weapons deals, deceptive claims that Saddam Hussein colluded with al-Qaeda," said Jody Grage Haug, Peace Action Committee member and co-chair of the Green Party of the United States.  "We must also hold Democrats responsible, since many of them supported the war and who joined with Republicans in surrendering Congress's constitutional power to declare war to the White House in October, 2002."


<p><b>Text of the GPAX statement:
</b>
<p>The Peace Action Committee of the Green Party of the United States applauds and supports the brave protest vigil taking place at the vacation home of President George W. Bush in Crawford, Texas by Cindy Sheehan, mother of Casey Sheehan who was killed in combat on 4/4/04 in Sadr City five days after arriving in Iraq.  We insist that President Bush meet with Ms. Sheehan and other individuals who have firsthand experienced the pain of a profound loss resulting from the current invasion and occupation of Iraq. Our leaders should not hide from the reality of these grave losses resulting from a war based on unsubstantiated pretenses.  The Peace Action Committee agrees with Cindy's quote: "Bring Our Troops Home IMMEDIATELY."
