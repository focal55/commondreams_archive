<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 30 -- On Thursday, March 31st Stopbolton.org will air television advertisements on three major Rhode Island TV stations in opposition to the nomination of John Bolton for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. The advertisements state that Bolton is the wrong man for the job because of his desire to dismantle the UN rather than reform it. The spots will air at 8 p.m. on WPIR (CBS), WNAC (FOX), and WJAR (NBC), as well as during the 6 p.m. evening news on NBC and during the 11 p.m. evening news on CBS.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal of the Stop Bolton campaign is to convince Rhode Island Senators John Chafee and Jack Reed that John Bolton is not the diplomat Americans want representing them at the UN. A moderate Republican and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Chafee's up-or-down vote on Bolton will be crucial in determining the fate of U.S.-UN relations. It won't be easy for Senator Chafee to vote against a Presidential nominee from his own party. So it is vital that local constituents contact the Senator to let him know they want a &quot;problem solver, not a loose cannon&quot; at the UN.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rhode Island television ads are the first stage of Stop Bolton's media outreach campaign. In addition, Stopbolton.org is running radio advertisements in Rhode Island and is exploring television spots in Wisconsin, Indiana, Florida and Nebraska. The Stop Bolton campaign has also organized a press conference, in which former U.S. Ambassadors will speak to the press about Bolton's nomination on Monday April 3, 2005 in Washington DC.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stopbolton.org was launched on March 15, 2005, to illustrate the critical nature of the U.S.-UN relationship, show the need for effective UN reform, and make the case that John Bolton is the wrong man for the job. Bolton has proven himself to be a divisive diplomat, the Stop Bolton campaign points out, with a track record of breaking bonds rather than creating coalitions. His nomination is tantamount to putting a fox in charge of the henhouse.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Launched by Citizens for Global Solutions, the campaign has been featured in such national papers as The Boston Herald, The Washington Times, and The New York Sun, as well as such noted blogs as American Prospect and the Washington Note.
