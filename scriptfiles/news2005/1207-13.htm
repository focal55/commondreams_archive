<p>STRASBOURG - December 7 - Council of Europe member states 
should flatly reject any proposals to establish standards for the use of 
diplomatic assurances in transfers of people to risk of torture, Amnesty 
International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Commission 
of Jurists said in a joint submission published today. 

<p>Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the International 
Commission of Jurists made their call as government representatives 
began a meeting at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, December 7- 9, to consider an initiative to elaborate "minimum requirements" for 
reliance on diplomatic assurances - agreements between states, 
sometimes also represented as "memoranda of understanding," that 
purportedly aim to protect an individual from torture and ill-treatment 
after transfer.   
  
<p>"Governments shouldn't cloak diplomatic assurances with the 
legitimacy that they don't deserve by creating standards for their use," 
said Jill Heine, Legal Adviser of the International Legal and 
Organizations Program at Amnesty International. "They should see 
such arrangements for what they are - unacceptable attempts by states 
to justify forcibly sending people to a place where they risk torture or 
ill-treatment."   
  
<p>Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the International 
Commission of Jurists warned governments that creating a framework 
for the "acceptable" use of inherently unreliable and legally 
unenforceable diplomatic assurances is incompatible with states' 
absolute obligation under international law to prevent torture and ill- treatment. This prohibition includes the obligation not to transfer 
people to places where they face a risk of such abusive treatment (the 
non-refoulement obligation).   
  
<p>"Diplomatic assurances have a proven record of failure," said 
Veronika Szente Goldston, Europe and Central Asia advocacy director 
of Human Rights Watch. "Our research shows that instead of 
protecting the persons subject to the assurances from torture and ill- treatment, they have actually exposed them to such abuse. As a result, 
diplomatic assurances are used not to satisfy states' legal obligations, 
but rather to circumvent them."   
  
<p>At the heart of the problem with diplomatic assurances is that the 
perceived need for such guarantees is in itself an acknowledgment that 
a risk of torture and ill-treatment exists in the receiving country. 
Diplomatic assurances create double standards and undermine the 
international system of protection against torture and ill-treatment. 
They divert attention from the systemic reforms required to prevent 
and eradicate torture in receiving states.   
  
<p>At the practical level, there is ample evidence to show that diplomatic 
assurances have not worked and there is nothing to suggest that 
refining them would result in adequate protection against torture and 
ill-treatment.   
  
<p>This is true even if the assurances contain arrangements for a post-
return monitoring mechanism.   
  
<p>"Arguments that post-return monitoring can make diplomatic 
assurances work are fundamentally misguided," said Gerald 
Staberock, Director of the Global Security and Rule of Law 
Programme of the International Commission of Jurists. "They ignore 
the very serious limitations of such monitoring, especially the fact that 
we are talking here about occasional visits to an isolated detainee who 
has every reason to fear reprisals if reporting mistreatment."   
  
<p>The case of Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian national forcibly returned to 
Egypt by the Swedish government with US involvement in 2001, is a 
glaring example of diplomatic assurances failing to fulfil their stated 
purpose, even when coupled with a post-return monitoring mechanism. 
Agiza has credibly alleged that he was subjected to torture upon return 
to Egypt despite regular visits by Swedish embassy representatives to 
him in prison. In a landmark decision in May, the United Nations 
Committee against Torture found Sweden to have violated its non-
refoulement obligation in this case.   
  
<p>Rather than seeking to perfect an inherently flawed device, Amnesty 
International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Commission 
of Jurists said member states of the Council of Europe should expend 
their energy on assisting governments around the world to take the 
range of necessary legislative, administrative, judicial and other 
measures required to ensure system-wide implementation of the 
international obligation to prevent and prohibit torture.   
  
<p>"Attempting to create standards for diplomatic assurances is only 
going to encourage their use, undermine the universal ban on torture, 
and ultimately expose more people to abuse," the organizations said.   
  
<p>Ironically, the governmental forum convening in Strasbourg - a group 
of experts etablished under the auspices of the Committee of Ministers 
Steering Committee for Human Rights - is the same that in 2002 
produced the most far-reaching set of standards to date to safeguard 
human rights in the fight against terrorism: the Council of Europe 
Guidelines on Human Rights and the Fight against Terrorism, which 
all member states of the Council of Europe have committed 
themselves to respect.   
  
<p>The practice of seeking diplomatic assurances against torture and ill- treatment is a global phenomenon, with governments of Europe and 
North America clearly leading the field. In Europe, Sweden and the 
United Kingdom have been among those most vocal in defending their 
use.   
  
<p>Governments' determination to use diplomatic assurances despite 
mounting evidence of their ineffectiveness has been coupled with an 
increasingly vocal and growing consensus among international experts 
and monitoring bodies, as well as some national courts, about the risks 
associated with their use. Manfred Nowak, the U.N. Special rapporteur 
on torture, for example, has consistently warned that "diplomatic 
assurances are unreliable and ineffective in the protection against 
torture and ill-treatment" and called on governments to refrain from 
their use.
