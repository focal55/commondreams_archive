The plan features no new measures to prevent contamination of surface water or the contamination of the freshwater aquifer beneath the region. The aquifer has enough fresh drinking water for 500,000 people.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Once again in New Mexico, we are being given a classic bait and switch,&#148; said Stephen Capra, executive director of the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance. &#147;We are told this is environmentally sound, but the facts clearly show the oil and gas industry is being given another free ride at the expense of New Mexico&#146;s future water supplies and our quality of life.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan also failed to consider the larger picture of whether the oil and gas in Otero Mesa is worth such a sacrifice, said Capra. A new analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows clean energy alternatives can handily accommodate the state&#146;s natural gas demands. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of the BLM&#146;s so-called Record of Decision for Otero and Sierra Counties was done by the Coalition for Otero Mesa, an alliance of conservation, sportsman and religious groups.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If BLM truly intended to make real commitments to protect Otero Mesa, it would have been easy,&#148; said The Wilderness Society's Nada Culver. &quot;Instead, many of the key monitoring and enforcement provisions are vague or undefined. BLM had a special opportunity to protect Otero Mesa's water and other natural resources but instead has essentially left them vulnerable.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Development of this grassland will clearly have long-term consequences not only for wildlife but the people who live and recreate there and the ranchers that have worked these lands for over five generations. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Sportsman continue to lose important lands for hunting, while the oil industry cannot even drill all the lands they have leased. We are losing the ability to pass down to our children a way of life&#148; said Oscar Simpson, President of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The attached fact sheet is designed to help you better understand the BLM&#146;s complex Record of Decision.<br>ANALYSIS OF THE OTERO MESA RECORD OF DECISION (ROD) AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) AMENDMENT<br>A lack of true commitment to protecting the region&#146;s natural resources. Shortcomings of the plan include:<br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan opens 95% of the planning area to oil and gas leasing<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 69% of lands (1,406,625 acres) remain open to leasing without any conditions on surface use or other protective stipulations<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 24% of lands (484,135 acres) are open to leasing with conditional surface use limitations<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 2% of lands (40,256 acres) with no surface occupancy stipulations<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Only 5% of lands (119,939 acres) are closed to leasing.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite local opposition and a wealth of new information, the above figures are essentially unchanged from the last version.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan does not prevent surface water or groundwater contamination<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan includes no new protective measures and no commitment to conducting further investigation of the existing water or even the available references on the aquifers that were not considered previously (such as earlier efforts to map some of the fractures).<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan does not make any actual commitment to conducting new NEPA analysis or halting further disturbance once the 1,589-acre surface disturbance threshold for the plan has been reached<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan discusses the potential need to conduct further analysis of environmental impacts if surface disturbance from oil and gas development exceeds anticipated levels, and BLM retains the right to delay or deny further activities during such analysis, but there is no language that formally commits the agency to taking these actions.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan still does not justify how the 5% surface disturbance threshold on leases in the Chihuahuan desert grasslands will actually result in protection<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The BLM provides no information about how this limitation will prevent habitat fragmentation &#150; no studies or analysis have been done. Although the ROD discusses the development of an automated tracking system to enforce the 5%, the BLM has not yet developed or used such a system. BLM has not even discussed onthe-<br>ground inspection or enforcement. &#147;Reclamation&#148; standards for grasslands have been weakened. These standards (which determine when acreage no longer &#147;counts&#148; toward the 5% surface disturbance) are based on BLM prescription and assessment.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Standard in final plan: &#147;successful&#148; reclamation is &#147;when healthy, mature perennials are established with a composition and density that closely approximates the surrounding vegetation as prescribed by the BLM, and the reclamation area is free of noxious weeds.&#148; <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Standard in previous version of plan: successful reclamation would be &#147;indicated by the existence of </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">healthy, mature annuals and perennials in the correct density and composition, as compared to the seed mixture established by the Authorized Officer.&#148; So, the presence of annuals in the grassland vegetation &#150; an important element of effective restoration-- is no longer required. Further, because these standards will be part of a reclamation plan to be developed between<br>BLM and the operator, they are subject to negotiation and difficult to monitor and enforce.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan includes no commitments to enforcing Best Management Practices (BMPs) for oil and gas<br>development. Although some BMPs are identified, none are required. Other BMPs are identified as possible but only after further analysis of other less restrictive alternatives. BLM&#146;s summary rejection of the Governor&#146;s appeal compromises potential protections of these lands<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BLM claims the plan is not inconsistent with New Mexico&#146;s Noxious Weed Management Act and while the Governor&#146;s comments on the lack of efficacy of BLM measures are &#147;noted,&#148; the plan does not take further action to improve them<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BLM agrees that it is important to implement BMPs to protect water resources &#150; but does not do so<br>in the ROD/RMP<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BLM acknowledges that New Mexico&#146;s Water Quality Control Commission Regulations do prohibitn impairing water quality but declines to implement any further protection, claiming that the Governor did not identify any exceedances or specific risks of exceedances due to RMP<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BLM says the issue of Cultural Resources Consultation is not to be raised by Governor, but by tribes BLM claims to conduct a &#147;discretionary review&#148; of the Governor&#146;s recommended management approach but focuses only on the possible economic benefits to State from oil &amp; gas development and the risks of<br>preventing &#147;the nation and New Mexico from realizing the benefits of domestic energy production.&#148; BLM does not acknowledge that its assessment is that development potential is low or moderate, so overall economic benefits are unsure while risks associated with development are significant &#150; including to welldocumented and extremely valuable water resources. Potential strengths of the plan:<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Provides more concrete application of Reasonable Foreseeable Development (RFD) as possible<br>limitation on further development<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the level of development appears likely to exceed that which was analyzed as the basis for the plan amendment, then BLM may be required to conduct further environmental analysis. The RFD limits are maximum of 141 wells or 1,589 acres of surface disturbance. However, there is no firm commitment in the ROD and the proposed automated tracking system for surface disturbance has not yet been developed.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increases black-tailed prairie dog protection<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now mandates 0.25 mile buffer between known colonies and surface disturbance and specifically recognizes that habitat in the planning area is limited; previously provided for potential relocation of surface-disturbing activities in a range of 0.125 mile to 0.25 mile.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deferral of leasing for bighorn sheep reintroduction<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leasing would be deferred in small area in Sierra County while the State works on potential reintroduction.<br>However:<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> would temporarily protect only about 1,200 acres in comparison to 199,020 acres that were protected under the Draft RMPA/EIS.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> although Director Clarke&#146;s letter to Gov. Richardson states that there will be a 5-year deferral, there is no time period in the plan for enforcement purposes<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BLM State Director will evaluate New Mexico Department of Game &amp; Fish&#146;s progress and remove protection whenever BLM unilaterally decides &#147;unlikely that reintroduction would occur&#148;<br>For more information, please call Nada Culver (The Wilderness Society, 303/650-5818, x 117) or Stephen<br>Capra (New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, 505/843-8696, x 114).</font></li></ul><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
