<p>NEW YORK - December 5  - The Pakistan earthquake, which fell from the headlines the past few weeks in spite of severe logistical and financial challenges to deliver aid, looks to become a breaking story again as winter has fallen on the Himalayan towns and villages that were most greatly affected by the earthquake that measured a 7.5 on the Richer Scale on 8 Oct. Several deaths have been reported and there are hundreds of pneumonia cases, mostly children, being treated in local hospitals in the past few days as a result of the recent snow and fall in temperatures. Food, which is one of Action Against Hunger's areas of intervention in Pakistan, has become the priority for relief groups. 

 

<p>“The next job is to continue the aid—particularly food— winter long. If funding for transportation, such as helicopters and trucks, runs out, people will die unnecessarily,” said Cathy Skoula, executive director of Action Against Hunger who has just returned from the mountains of Pakistan.

 

<p>“At the moment funding for the United Nations flash appeal for Pakistan is still less than 50% of the funds requested. At this rate, funding will run out in January and the Pakistani people, who have already suffered greatly from the earthquake, will suffer again. The difference this time is that the global community can prevent this from happening,” Ms. Skoula continued.

 

<p>Action Against Hunger started its emergency aid programs in Pakistan the day after the earthquake and is providing shelter items, food aid, and water and sanitation supplies to earthquake victims in Rashang, Balakot, Jared, and Battagram. Full details on ACF's programs in Pakistan are available at <a href="http://www.actionagainsthunger.org">www.actionagainsthunger.org</a>. Ms. Skoula is available for interviews.
