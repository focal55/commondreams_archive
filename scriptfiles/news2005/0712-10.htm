<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 12 - Children 
        and youth in the District of Columbia are far less likely than their peers 
        in the 50 states to be victims of firearm suicide, a new Violence Policy 
        Center (VPC) study reveals <a href="../studies/dcsuicide.pdf">(please 
        follow this link for the full text of the study)</a>. The study finds 
        that NO District youths 16 years of age or younger died as the result 
        of firearm suicide during the years 2000 through 2002, the most recent 
        years for which data from the National Center for Injury Prevention and 
        Control's WISQARS database is available. In addition, during this period 
        there were no suicides by any other means by District youth in this age 
        group. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study ranks gun 
        suicide rates among children and teens age 16 and younger for all of the 
        50 states and the District of Columbia. The 10 states with the highest 
        rates in the 16 and younger age group were Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, 
        North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. 
        These states all had rates that far exceeded the national average of 0.45 
        per hundred thousand (see list below). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gun 
        laws in all of these states can be characterized as extremely weak. </font>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VPC Legislative Director 
        Kristen Rand states, "This study shows that the District's ban on handguns 
        and assault weapons works to prevent youth suicide by keeping guns out 
        of D.C. homes. The findings highlight the sheer lunacy of Congressional 
        efforts to repeal D.C.'s tough laws. Congress would virtually be writing 
        a death sentence for some young people by repealing District laws that 
        are working to prevent youth suicide." </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legislation to repeal 
        the District's gun laws is pending in both the House (H.R. 1288, sponsored 
        by Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN)) and the Senate (S. 1082, sponsored by Sen. 
        Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX)). The home states of the bills' sponsors also 
        had gun suicide rates for youth 16 years of age and younger that were 
        above the national average: 0.58 per 100,000 for Indiana and 0.53 per 
        100,000 for Texas. Last week, the U.S. House approved an amendment to 
        D.C.'s 2006 appropriations bill that prevents enforcement of the District's 
        safe storage and child safety lock requirements for firearms.</font>
