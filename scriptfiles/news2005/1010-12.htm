<p>SANTA BARBARA, California - The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation is pleased
to announce it will honor Dr. Daniel Ellsberg with its 2005 Distinguished Peace
Leadership Award and The Honorable Douglas Roche, O.C. with its Lifetime
Achievement Award. Following the awards presentation, Helen Thomas will conduct a
live unscripted interview with both honorees. The Awards will be presented during the
Foundation’s 22nd annual Evening for Peace gala and ceremony on Saturday, October 29,
2005 at Fess Parker’s Doubletree Resort in Santa Barbara, California. The theme for the
2005 awards dinner is Taking a Stand for Peace.
<p>Dr. Daniel Ellsberg was a top-level analyst for the RAND Corporation assigned
to the Pentagon when he released the Pentagon Papers to the news media. His actions
shined the light of truth on secret US policies in Vietnam and helped to turn public
opinion against that war and bring it to an end. For exposing the Pentagon Papers,
Ellsberg was prosecuted and faced more than 100 years in prison. Fortunately, his case
was dismissed when the Nixon administration committed illegal acts in raiding the office
of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist. Since that time, for more than 35 years, Daniel Ellsberg has
been active in working for peace, government accountability and the abolition of nuclear
weapons.

<p>The Honorable Douglas Roche, O.C. is a former Canadian Ambassador for
Disarmament and member of the Canadian Senate who has played a major role in the
global effort to eliminate nuclear weapons. In 1998, he formed the Middle Powers
Initiative, a coalition of eight international civil society organizations, including the
Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, to encourage and assist middle power governments to put
pressure on the nuclear weapons states to fulfill their disarmament obligations under the
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>Helen Thomas will conduct an unscripted live interview with both honorees at
the annual Evening for Peace. Noted for her tough questions and pioneering spirit, Helen
Thomas is widely acknowledged as the dean of the White House press corps. She served
for 57 years as a correspondent for United Press International and, as White House
Bureau Chief, covered every president since John F. Kennedy. She is currently a
nationally syndicated columnist for Hearst Newspapers.
<p>Since 1984, the Foundation has honored some of the great peace leaders of our
time, including His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Helen
Caldicott, Captain Jacques Cousteau, Jody Williams, and King Hussein of Jordon, among
others. The Distinguished Peace Leadership Award is presented annually to individuals
who have demonstrated courageous leadership in the cause of peace.
<p>For more than 20 years, the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation has been committed to
advancing initiatives to eliminate the nuclear weapons threat to all life, to fostering the
global rule of law, and to building an enduring legacy of peace through education and
advocacy. The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation is a non-profit, non-partisan international
organization with consultative status to the United Nations.<!-- #EndEditable -->
