<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, DC - At three events on June 15th and June 16th, members of Gold Star Families for Peace (GSFP) and Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) will travel to Washington, DC to press for answers regarding the so-called Downing Street Memo and for the truth about the decision to invade Iraq.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wednesday, June 15th</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of Gold Star Families for Peace, a national organization of families whose loved ones died as a result of the war in Iraq, will meet with Members of Congress on June 15, 2005 to call on them to support a "Resolution of Inquiry" into the so-called Downing Street Memo. Members of Gold Star Families for Peace believe that the Downing Street Memo is a "smoking gun" and validation that the invasion of Iraq was based on prefabricated intelligence. GSFP members who have lost their dearest family members believe that their loved ones died needlessly, senselessly, and avoidably in the aggression against Iraq.
