<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 4 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">News Advisory:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlighting allegations of voting irregularities in the 2004 Presidential election and, therefore, the need to challenge the electors, the Committee to ReDefeat the President, a federal PAC better known by the name of its popular ReDefeatBush.com Web site, will hold a &quot;Rally for the Republic&quot; tonight, Tuesday, Jan. 4, at 7 p.m. in San Francisco's Herbst Theater at 401 Van Ness Ave. The rally is open to the press and public.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Thursday, the electoral votes for election of the President are to be opened and counted in a joint session of Congress. Several members of Congress are planning to object to the counting of the votes because of numerous irregularities in the voting and counting of votes.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Florida Rep. Peter Deutsch, who led the effort to challenge the Florida electors in 2000 and is now advising groups organizing this year's challenge, said, &quot;It is shocking that we are seeing some of the same outrageous examples of discrimination in access to voting in 2004 that we saw in Florida in 2000.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At tonight's San Francisco rally, ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel will be joined by recent graduates of the Electoral College in California and Emily Levy, who will report on her work with statistician Richard Hayes Phillips about anomalies in the Ohio election results. Music and humor will be provided by Electile Dysfunction. Linda Bryket's 24-minute film on what happened in Columbus, Ohio on Election Day will also be shown.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
