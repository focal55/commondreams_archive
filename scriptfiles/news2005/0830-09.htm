<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BOSTON - August 30 - 2004 was a banner year for  CEOs and a dismal year for workers, according to a new report  from the Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair  Economy, &quot;Executive Excess 2005: Defense Contractors Get More  Bucks for the Bang.&quot;
<p>   The ratio of average CEO pay (now $11.8 million) to worker pay  (now $27,460) spiked up from 301-to-1 in 2003 to 431-to-1 in  2004.</p>
<p>   If the minimum wage had risen as fast as CEO pay since 1990,  the lowest paid workers in the United States would be earning  $23.03 an hour today, not $5.15 an hour.</p>
<p>   The report found that CEOs are individually profiting from the  Iraq War, with huge average raises at the biggest defense  contractors.</p>
<p>   At the 34 publicly traded U.S. corporations among the 2004 top  100 defense contractors with 10 percent or more of their revenues  from defense contracts -- companies such as United Technologies,  Textron, and General Dynamics -- average CEO pay increased 200  percent from 2001 to 2004, versus 7 percent for all CEOs.</p>
<p>   For example, David H. Brooks, CEO of bulletproof vest maker  DHB Industries, earned $70 million in 2004, 13,349 percent more  than his 2001 compensation of $525,000. Brooks also sold company  stock worth about $186 million last year, spooking investors who  drove DHB's share price from more than $22 to as low as $6.50. In  May 2005, the US Marines recalled more than 5,000 DHB armored  vests after questions were raised about their effectiveness. By  that time, Brooks had pocketed over $250 million in war  windfalls.</p>
<p>   Since September 11, the ratio between median pay for defense  CEOs and pay for military generals has nearly doubled to 23-to-1,  up from 12-to-1 just three years earlier. The pay ratio between  defense CEOs and army privates soared to 160-to-1, up from just  89-to-1 in 2001.</p>
<p>   The report reviewed trends in CEO pay and gave CEO Hall of  Shame awards to executives who have exemplified five types of  excessive pay:</p>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>PENSION UNDERFUNDERS: The CEOs of those firms with the most  underfunded pensions, on average, received 72 percent more than  the average large company CEO.<br>
   <br>
  Inducted into the CEO Hall of Shame in this category is Exxon  Mobil's Lee Raymond.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li>TAX DODGERS: 46 large companies paid no federal income tax  in 2003, despite collectively earning $30 billion in profits.  Some of the savings wound up in the pockets of their CEOs, who  made $12.6 million in average pay in 2004.<br>
   <br>
  Inducted into the CEO Hall of Shame in this category is  Pfizer's Hank McKinnell.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li> BOOK COOKERS: In the last ten years, CEOs of firms with  shady accounting appeared 18 times on the top ten lists of  highest paid executives. This includes leaders whose companies  were either later found to have committed fraud or were forced to  make material restatements of earnings to correct previous  overstatements of profits.<br>
   <br>
  Inducted into the CEO Hall of Shame in this category is Tyco's  Dennis Kozlowski, the highest paid book cooker - more than a half  billion dollars.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li> STOCK TANKERS: If you had invested in the stock of the  company led by the year's single highest paid CEO each year since  1990, you actually would have lost money. You would have done  nearly six times better by investing in the S&amp;P 500 index. A  $10,000 investment in such a Greedy CEO portfolio in 1991 would  have decreased in value to $8,079 by the end of 2004, while a  similar investment in the S&amp;P 500 would have increased to  $48,350.<br>
   <br>
  Inducted into the CEO Hall of Shame in this category is  Computer Associates' Charles Wang.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li> GROSS PAY: Over the last 15 years, the cumulative pay of  the ten highest paid CEOs in each year together totals more than  $11.7 billion.<br>
   <br>
  Inducted into the CEO Hall of Shame in this category is  Citigroup's Sandy Weill, whose $1.1 billion in cumulative pay  since 1990 topped all others.</li>
 </ul>
