<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 18 - Today, The Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, president of The Interfaith Alliance, said he is troubled that files related to John Roberts' nomination to the Supreme Court, entitled "Affirmative Action Correspondence," had been in possession of Administration officials in July, but are now missing. 

<p>"Certain information that raises red flags has come out in the past month on Mr. Roberts' record," Gaddy said, "but The Interfaith Alliance stands firm in its position to let the process unfold as we continue to gather information and watch the confirmation hearings with a close eye.  We are concerned that with files conspicuously missing, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee cannot fully investigate Mr. Roberts' professional background and judicial philosophy.  A fair hearing can only occur when all Senators and the White House work together to ensure the sanctity of this important process that will have an impact upon Americans for decades. 

<p>"Furthermore, we believe the nominations process for a life-time seat to the Supreme Court should not be hindered by a rush to judgment or a rush in the process.  We encourage Senators to weigh all the facts and make an informed decision that best reflects their wishes and the wishes of their constituents. To that end, The Interfaith Alliance is also still gathering information on John Roberts and we are looking forward to an engaged and informative hearing beginning September 6." The Interfaith Alliance also urges Congress and the public to respect the Constitution's ban on religious tests for public office by neither asking about nor discussing Roberts' personal religion and beliefs. No one, including Senators, should ask the identity of a judicial nominee's personal religious affiliation or lack thereof. 
Gaddy ended by saying, "However, every Senator has the right-I would argue even the duty-to ask judicial nominees how, or if, their personal beliefs about religion will affect their decisions and rulings related to the Constitution.  No less a commitment to religious liberty should be acceptable by any judicial nominee or by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee."
