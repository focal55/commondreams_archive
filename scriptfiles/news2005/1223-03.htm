<p>NEW YORK - December 23 - The Brennan Center for  Justice at NYU School of Law expressed deep concern over a  provision of the Defense Appropriations bill that Congress has  passed.  This provision would effectively permit the use of  evidence obtained by torture in the cases of Guantanamo Naval  Base detainees.  The amendment, introduced by Sens. Lindsey  Graham, Carl Levin and Jon Kyl, would severely curtail federal  court review of detainees' cases, allow military tribunals to  rely on evidence gained from torture, and undermine vital ongoing  attorney-client relations for Guantanamo detainees. </p>
<p>   &quot;The Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment is flatly inconsistent with  our constitutional heritage,&quot; said Michael Waldman, executive  director of the Brennan Center.  &quot;Congress has never before  allowed physically coerced information to be used as the basis  for decisions about individual liberty.&quot; </p>
<p>   The Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment is part of a legislative  package with an amendment proposed by Sen. John McCain that would  bar cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment by any U.S.  personnel.  But the Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment opens a backdoor  to torture:  It would permit the CIA to cooperate with foreign  intelligence services that use torture to extract evidence  through coercion.  That evidence would then be available as a  basis for detention decisions. </p>
<p>   &quot;Congress is taking with one hand what it has given with the  other,&quot; explained Waldman.  Never before in American history has  a Congress put its stamp of approval on the use of physically  coerced testimony to make decisions between liberty and  imprisonment.  Even in past times of war, this practice has no  precedent. </p>
<p>   &quot;This bill will not put an end to physically coercive  interrogation tactics that yield unreliable information,  cautioned Professor Burt Neuborne, legal director of the Brennan  Center and Inez Milholland professor of Civil Liberties at NYU  School of Law,  &quot;But it will erode our moral standing in the  world community and subject our troops to almost certain  reprisals in the future.&quot;  Professor Neuborne spearheaded a  letter, signed now by more than 450 law professors, urging  Congress to remove the Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment from the  Authorization bill.  The Brennan Center has also organized a  similar letter, from a distinguished bipartisan group of retired  federal judges, opposing the Amendment. </p>
<p>   The Brennan Center urges senators and representatives to  repeal the Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment in the 2006 National  Defense Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity.
