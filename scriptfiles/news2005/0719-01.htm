<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OXFORD, UK - July 19 - &#147;A Dossier on Civilian Casualties in Iraq, 2003-2005&#148; is the first detailed account of all non-combatants reported killed or wounded during the first two years of the continuing conflict.  The report, published by Iraq Body Count in association with Oxford Research Group, is based on comprehensive analysis of over 10,000 media reports published between March 2003 and March 2005.</font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Findings include:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      Who was killed?</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">24,865 civilians were reported killed in the first two years.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women and children accounted for almost 20% of all civilian deaths. </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baghdad alone recorded almost half of all deaths.</font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When did they die?</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">30% of civilian deaths occurred during the invasion phase before 1 May 2003.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Post-invasion, the number of civilians killed was almost twice as high in year two (11,351) as in year one (6,215).</font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who did the killing?</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">US-led forces killed 37% of civilian victims.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anti-occupation forces/insurgents killed 9% of civilian victims.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Post-invasion criminal violence accounted for 36% of all deaths.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Killings by anti-occupation forces, crime and unknown agents have shown a steady rise over the entire period.</font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What was the most lethal weaponry?</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over half (53%) of all civilian deaths involved explosive devices.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Air strikes caused most (64%) of the explosives deaths.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children were disproportionately affected by all explosive devices but most severely by air strikes and unexploded ordnance (including cluster bomblets). </font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How many were injured?</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least 42,500 civilians were reported wounded.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The invasion phase caused 41% of all reported injuries.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Explosive weaponry caused a higher ratio of injuries to deaths than small arms. </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The highest wounded-to-death ratio incidents occurred during the invasion phase.</font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who provided the information?</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mortuary officials and medics were the most frequently cited witnesses.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three press agencies provided over one third of the reports used. </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraqi journalists are increasingly central to the reporting work.</font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking today at the launch of the report in London, Professor John Sloboda, FBA, one of the report's authors said:  &quot;The ever-mounting Iraqi death toll is the forgotten cost of the decision to go to war in Iraq.  On average, 34 ordinary Iraqis have met violent deaths every day since the invasion of March 2003. Our data show that no sector of Iraqi society has escaped. We sincerely hope that this research will help to inform decision-makers around the world about the real needs of the Iraqi people as they struggle to rebuild their country.  It remains a matter of the gravest concern that, nearly two and half years on, neither the US nor the UK governments have begun to systematically measure the impact of their actions in terms of human lives destroyed.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electronic copies of the report will be available for download from the Iraq Body Count website (<a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org" target="_new">www.iraqbodycount.org</a>) at 13.30 BST on Tuesday 19 July 2005.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
