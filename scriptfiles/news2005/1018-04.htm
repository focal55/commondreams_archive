<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MANAQUIRI, Brazil - The devastating drought currently 
affecting the Amazon rainforest is part of a vicious cycle created by 
the combined affects of global warming and deforestation and could cause 
the collapse of the rainforest, according to scientists (1) from the 
Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia and Greenpeace.
 
<p>"Brazil is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate changes in 
the world because of its invaluable biodiversity. If the Amazon loses 
more than 40% of its forest cover, we will reach a turning point from 
where we cannot reverse the savannization process of the world's largest 
forest," said Carlos Nobre, from the Brazilian National Institute for 
Space Research (INPE) and President of the International Geosphere 
Biosphere Program (IGBP) (2).
 
<p>Seventeen per cent of the Amazon has been completely wiped out over the 
past 30 years, according to INPE, and even more has been damaged by 
destructive and illegal logging and other human activities.  Life on 
Earth depends on ancient forests for its survival. They are the richest 
most diverse habitats, and help stabilize climate and regulate the weather.
 
<p>"This drought and its effects are really shocking. Towns are lacking 
food, medicines and fuel because boats cannot get through," said Carlos 
Rittl, Greenpeace Brazil's climate campaigner.
 
<p>"If the landscape I've seen this week is a sign of things to come, we're 
in serious trouble (3). We risk losing the world's largest rainforest, 
the network of rivers and invaluable and varied life it sustains, much 
of which we haven't even discovered or researched."
 
<p>Amazonian deforestation and fires account for more than 75% of Brazil's 
greenhouse gas emissions and place it amongst the top four contributors 
to global climate change.
 
<p>"The Amazon is caught between two destructive forces and their combined 
effects threaten to flip its ecosystems from forest to savannah if 
measures are not taken to stop deforestation and combat climate change," 
said Rittl.
 
<p>Greenpeace is calling on governments to take urgent action to stop 
deforestation and commit to the massive CO2 reductions needed to protect 
the Earth's biodiversity and millions of people who are at risk from the 
impacts of climate change and ancient forest destruction.
 
<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative communications tools to put the spotlight on 
global environmental problems, and to drive towards solutions essential 
for a green and peaceful future.

(1) The LBA is an international research initiative led by Brazil which 
aims to create the knowledge needed to understand the climatological, 
ecological, biogeochemical and hydrological functioning of Amazonia, the 
impact of land use change on these functions and the interactions 
between Amazonia and the Earth system.

(3) Greenpeace has been gathering dramatic images of the worst drought 
in 40 years in the Amazon this week. The Amazon River basin is at its 
lowest level in decades. Floodplains have dried up and people are 
walking and using bicycles on areas in which canoes and riverboats used 
to be the only means of transport. Large boats have become stuck in the 
dry mud and the landscape is covered with thousands of rotting dead 
fish, which are attracting dozens of vultures.
