<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Today's U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the medical 
marijuana case, Gonzales v. Raich, does not invalidate state medical 
marijuana laws and should have essentially no impact on their 
implementation, officials of the Marijuana Policy Project said today. 
The ruling allows federal authorities to enforce federal marijuana 
laws against patients who are protected under state medical marijuana 
laws -- preserving the status quo as it has existed since California 
passed the first effective medical marijuana law in 1996 and leaving 
it up to Congress to protect patients from federal attacks.

    </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While we're disappointed, the validity of state medical marijuana laws was never at issue in this case," said Rob Kampia, executive 
director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C., which 
provided major funding for the litigation. "The medical marijuana laws of Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, 
Oregon, Washington, and Vermont will continue to protect patients from arrest by state and local authorities. Because the DEA and other 
federal agents make only one percent of our nation's 750,000 marijuana arrests every year, patients in states with medical marijuana laws 
retain a high level of protection. Congress should act today to give 
those patients complete protection from arrest."

   </font><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In his opinion, Justice Stevens stressed the need for medical 
marijuana patients to use the democratic process, putting the ball in 
Congress' court," Kampia noted. "This is especially important now 
because next week, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on an 
amendment that would prevent the federal government from spending 
funds to interfere with state medical marijuana laws."

   </font><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Just because the Supreme Court has said the federal government 
can continue to arrest medical marijuana patients doesn't mean the 
federal government must do so," Kampia added. "Unfortunately, because 
there is no indication that the DEA is going to resist the urge to 
arrest seriously ill patients, Congress must step in to protect 
patients without delay."

  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Legislation to protect medical marijuana patients continues to 
enjoy strong support from both the medical community and the general 
public. Organizations endorsing such protections include the American 
Public Health Association, American Nurses Association, American 
Academy of HIV Medicine, and the state medical associations of New 
York, California, and Rhode Island.
