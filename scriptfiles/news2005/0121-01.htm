<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 21 -- The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is accepting applications for its Messenger-Anderson Journalism Internship/Scholarship Program for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) students. Self-identified LGBT high school seniors and undergraduate college students who plan to pursue a degree in journalism or communications at an accredited four-year college or university are encouraged to apply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Messenger-Anderson Scholarship Award is $5000 for the first year, followed by $2,500 each year for the next two years, bringing the award total to $10,000. Applicants must re-apply each year. Winners are required to participate in an eight-week Messenger-Anderson Scholarship Intern Program at one of the Task Force offices during the summer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The postmark deadline for applications is February 24, 2005.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Communications Team is responsible for educating the public about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues by articulating the Task Force's mission to build a grassroots political power through the media, by disseminating materials produced by the Task Force Policy Institute, and by responding to public information requests. By working to shape public discourse, the Communications Team contributes directly to the Task Force mission of advancing social justice.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Messenger-Anderson Scholarships allows students to hone their skills in several areas of communications practice. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: tracking news coverage of the Task Force, researching media opportunities, assisting with rapid response to breaking stories, writing and editing press releases, and updating website. Successful candidates should have strong communication skills, both orally and in writing, and demonstrate a desire and commitment to work in a multi-cultural environment where commitment to diversity based on race, ethnic origin, gender, age, sexual orientation and physical ability is an important institutional value.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For application guidelines and to download an application, visit <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/aboutus/messenger.cfm" target="_new">http://www.thetaskforce.org/aboutus/messenger.cfm</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Messenger-Anderson Scholarship was donated by Larry Messenger and Jim Anderson in memory of Lawrence and Selina Messenger. The Messengers believed that there was a pressing need to encourage LGBT people to become more involved in shaping media coverage. Fair coverage of LGBT issues insists upon the basic premise that we are all created equal; however, media coverage today often begins with the discriminatory notion that equality for LGBT people is somehow a matter for debate. By encouraging LGBT students to pursue journalism and by assisting them with their studies, the Task Force hopes to improve the way the LGBT community and movement are covered.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1973, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force was the first national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights and advocacy organization and remains the movement's leading voice for freedom, justice, and equality. We work to build the grassroots political strength of our community by training state and local activists and leaders and organizing broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation. Our Policy Institute, the community's premiere think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a world that respects and makes visible the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. Headquartered in Washington, DC, we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, and Cambridge. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
