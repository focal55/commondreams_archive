Jim McDermott (D-Wash.)</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.)</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Punk Band Anti-Flag, co-directors of the Underground Action Alliance</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Launch of national 'opt-out' campaign and petition drive to end involuntary military recruitment in high schools permitted under the current No Child Left Behind Act</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: 1:30 p.m., Thursday, March 17</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: Cannon Terrace, adjacent to Cannon House Office Building, Washington, D.C.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Jim McDermott, who is a military veteran and the only psychiatrist in the U.S. Congress, and Rep. Pete Stark, an Air Force veteran, will appear with the punk band Anti-Flag, who represent the newly formed <a href="http://www.militaryfreezone.org/" target="_new">http://www.militaryfreezone.org</a>, as the group launches a national drive to restore privacy to student records.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No Child Left Behind was supposed to mean academic opportunity,&quot; McDermott said, &quot;but the federal law permits a military recruiter to obtain private student information, and that is not right.&quot; McDermott added; &quot;I support our military, but young people, not government, should make the decision about whether to explore a military career.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Not only has No Child Left Behind been shortchanged by the war in Iraq, now we learn the military is using it for an immoral recruitment scheme,&#148; said Rep. Pete Stark. &#147;No Child Left Behind is supposed to be about student achievement, not military recruiting.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McDermott and Stark explained that Section 9528 of NCLB grants military recruiters access to students' private records unless students, parents and guardians opt out in writing.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justin Sane, lead singer for the band, said, &quot;It's time that leaders making laws that affect us -- hear from us. How can anyone wonder why young people mistrust so many adults when a law gets passed that invades young people&#146;s privacy without even their knowledge or consent?&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To reach as many young people as possible, the band is launching <a href="http://www.militaryfreezone.org/" target="_new">http://www.militaryfreezone.org</a>, which will give young people and parents the information and tools to help them take action.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McDermott said, &quot;High schools across America are drug-free, alcohol-free and weapons-free; they should also be military-free. Every branch of the military has a multi-million dollar advertising budget; that's more than enough in the way of resources to reach young people.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
