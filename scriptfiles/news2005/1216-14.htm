<p>WASHINGTON  - December 16 - Earlier today, Governor Jeb Bush signed into law new changes to the Medicaid program applicable to Broward and Duval counties.  The Governor’s new law waives a broad set of federal laws designed to protect the most vulnerable who rely on Medicaid. 

<p>The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director for Families USA, about the waiver:

<p>"Governor Bush is speaking out of both sides of his mouth.  First, he brags about the importance of this proposal because it will save significant money for the state.  Then he promises that the state’s seniors, children, and people with disabilities who rely on Medicaid for their health care safety net won’t be hurt.  

<p>“In the real world, you can’t have it both ways.  The Governor’s actions will undoubtedly result in higher out-of-pocket costs and the withholding of care for the poorest residents of Broward and Duval counties.  In the end, it will cause people to go without care and force them to pay more for the care that they do receive.

<p>“The harmful impacts of this waiver should not be underestimated and should be carefully analyzed before this proposal is extended to other Florida counties or to other states across the country.  Families USA will carefully monitor the impact of this proposal in Broward and Duval counties.”
