Eleven people lost their lives in Haiti and ten in Cuba. Hurricane Dennis then continued to Jamaica where it caused heavy landslides.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The country most severely affected was Cuba, where the Hurricane devastated 11 provinces and caused the evacuation of 1.5 million people. According to the latest reports 120,000 homes were affected to different degrees. Agricultural production has suffered such severe and comprehensive damage that it has resulted in an immediate and direct impact on the food security of the country. It is estimated that the recovery process will take a long time. This is the fourth year in a row that Cuba has been seriously hit by hurricanes.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Haiti, heavy rain flooded the southern parts of the country and 1,000 were evacuated.

They are planning to respond in this area and their first estimation of resources needed to respond to the crisis situation is U$66,000. An appeal might be forthcoming.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACT member in Haiti, Christian Aid (CAID) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) reported that they are assessing the situation.
