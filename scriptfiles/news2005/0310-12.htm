<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- With concerns about childhood obesity, youth violence and precocious sexuality on the rise, more than 100 scholars, activists, lawmakers and concerned parents will gather in Washington, DC this weekend to examine the role corporate marketing plays in children&#146;s lives at a summit hosted by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC).  The summit, Consuming Kids:  How Marketing Undermines Children&#146;s Health, Values &amp; Behavior, will be held at Howard University&#146;s Blackburn Center from March 11-13.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Never before have so many leading scholars and activists gathered to discuss the commercialization of childhood . . . and what can be done to stop it.  Presenters include Susan Linn, author of Consuming Kids; Juliet Schor, author of Born to Buy; Michael Brody of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; Diane Levin, author of Remote Control Childhood; Nell &#147;the Movie Mom&#148; Minow; and Ralph Nader.  Many of the organizations that have been at the forefront of the struggle to protect children from commercial exploitation &#150; including Kids Can Make a Difference, the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the TV-Turnoff Network - will also be represented at the summit.  Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint of the Judge Baker Children&#146;s Center and Enola Aird of the Motherhood Project will moderate.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to examining the ways marketing encourages unhealthy eating habits, youth violence, precocious sexuality, family stress, and contributes to children&#146;s diminished capacity to play creatively, speakers will focus on how commercialism contributes to problems for minority youth and the role altruism can play as an antidote to commercial culture.  Suggestions will be offered for ways parents can combat commercialism at home and in their communities, as well as policy solutions to curtail the $15 billion barrage of marketing aimed at children every year. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;There is increasing concern that marketing has infiltrated nearly every aspect of children&#146;s lives,&#148; said CCFC&#146;s co-founder Dr. Linn.  &#147;We represent a growing movement to counter commercial messages and find concrete ways to reclaim childhood from corporate marketers.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/events.htm" target="_new">http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/events.htm</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On-site registration will be available throughout the summit.</font></p><p> </p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) is a national coalition that counters the harmful effects of advertising on children.
