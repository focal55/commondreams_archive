<p>MANILA - November 7 - An explosive report released today by 
Greenpeace reveals how climate change will deepen the misery of 
Filipinos along with other Asians unless measures are taken to 
drastically cut the use of fossil fuels such as coal.

<p>"Climate change will aggravate the misery  of an already over-burdened 
Filipino community," said Leoncio Amadore PhD, one of the Philippine's 
foremost meteorologists and author of the study  Crisis or Opportunity: 
Climate Change Impacts in the Philippines   The study determined that 
increasing trends in temperature, sea level rise and extreme climate 
events in the Philippines are consistent with global trends.

<p>Dr Amadore added that findings in the Third Assessment Report by the 
United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been 
manifested in the Philippines by extreme climate occurrence such as, 
floods, droughts, forest fires, and an increase in tropical cyclones in 
tropical Asia.

<p>The severity of climate change is already bringing two of the world's 
mightiest rivers at the brink of collapse.  Scientists from the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences say that environmental damage linked to climate 
change is pushing the Yellow River source into an ecological breakdown, 
threatening the lifeblood of 120 million people who rely on it for 
domestic as well as agricultural and industrial uses.  In the Amazon 
river region, one of the worst droughts ever recorded is damaging the 
world's largest rainforest, with wildfires breaking out, fresh drinking 
water becoming scarce and polluted and the death of millions of fish as 
the streams dry up.

<p>The sector most affected by climate change, is agriculture and food 
security. The sharpest falls in agricultural production are experienced 
during strong El Niño events and after the occurrence of severe tropical 
cyclones.

<p>"Climate change is not caused by developing countries yet the poorest 
people of Asia will bear the brunt of global warming," said Amadore.  
"The same vulnerable countries in the region sadly are not well-poised 
to respond to such disasters.  Countries must combine both adaptive 
strategies such as disaster-preparedness programs and, continuous 
vulnerability assessments along with emission reduction measures such as 
displacing fossil power with renewables and energy efficiency."

<p>"Renewable energy is starting to deliver the goods for millions of 
people worldwide. The wind resources of the Philippines and China are 
enormous.¹The potential for energy efficiency and conservation across 
the region is huge. Asia faces the choice of embracing ruin or 
opportunity," said Red Constantino of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.  
Greenpeace also called on international funding institutions, such as 
the Asian Development Bank, to act commensurate to the scale of the 
problem by re-orienting financing away from coal and towards renewable 
energy.

<p>Greenpeace's "Asia Energy Revolution Tour" of Australia, Hong Kong, 
Philippines and Thailand calls for an urgent break from coal and to 
promote a massive shift to clean, renewable energy. In the Philippines, 
Greenpeace is campaigning for the government to generate 10% of the 
country's energy supply from the sun, wind and modern biomass by 2010.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
