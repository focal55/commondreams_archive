<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ST. LOUIS -- February 18 -- More than 26,000 companion animals are destroyed every day. One thousand every hour. Eighteen every minute. Thousands more die a horrible death on the city streets, alone and unwanted. America's &quot;throw away, convenience-driven&quot; society somehow makes it acceptable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Randy Grim, founder of Stray Rescue of St. Louis, brings awareness to the plight of these animals, along with an amazing story of miracles and heroism, in his new book 'Miracle Dog: How Quentin Survived the Gas Chamber to Speak for Animals on Death Row'. The miracle of Quentin's survival, standing on top of 7 dead dogs when the gas chamber door was opened, is just the beginning. Today, Randy Grim and Quentin travel around the U.S. promoting the concept of animal guardianship and the need for no kill shelters.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Grim tells the story as no one else can -- with humor and passion. Alongside the story of Quentin's survival and the media frenzy following runs the embarrassing statistics about America's homeless dogs: why so many dogs are relinquished to shelters when only 12 to 14 percent nationally are adopted; the staggering number that are euthanized; and the sometimes appalling manner in which this is handled. For every two animals that have homes, there's one on the street. Living in a wild state, but with no knowledge of how to survive on their own, these dogs breed and die by the thousands in our cities. Guard dogs and fighting dogs that are abused and either escape or are turned out add to the problem. Grim's eye-opening account, based on a decade as a shelter operator and personal experience rescuing street dogs, provides a wealth of statistics for those interested in animal welfare.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to managing a staff of over 200 volunteers at Stray Rescue, Randy Grim and Quentin have appeared on The Today Show, John Walsh, Animal Planet and have been featured in Guideposts, and People magazines. Grim has received the Guardian Award, the Red Cross Life Saver award, and the St. Louis FOCUS award.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
