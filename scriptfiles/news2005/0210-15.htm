With the Iraqi election now complete and the costs of the occupation mounting daily, discussion of near-term US withdrawal has gained a new urgency - both here and in Iraq. But is it practical and how might it be done? </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The panel will clarify options for the &quot;near-term&quot; withdrawal of US forces from Iraq.  While specifying, step by step, different possible paths out, panelists will also assess the practical difficulties, risks, and costs of withdrawal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; How might near-term withdrawal impact Iraq during this period of transition and reconstruction? Does military withdrawal mean &quot;abandonment&quot;? <br>&quot; Would withdrawal increase the likelihood of civil strife and boost the insurgency? How might the United States mitigate this and other possible negative effects of withdrawal in the near term? <br>&quot; How should we weigh the risks of withdrawal in terms of US goals and interests? What would near-term withdrawal imply about US goals and accomplishment in the country and region? If we withdraw now, what mission have we accomplished? <br>&quot; How would withdrawal affect America's regional standing and the war on terrorism?</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
