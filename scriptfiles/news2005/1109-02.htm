<p>WASHINGTON - November 9 - The African Union Mission in Sudan will be unable to carry out its job in Darfur unless the U.S. and the UN take active measures to provide support, Refugees International said in a new report today. <a href="http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/publication/detail/7222">No Power to Protect: The African Union Mission in Sudan</a> shows that with the recent surge in violence, the African Union force is being tested by armed factions. For the African Union to succeed in providing security in the short-term, the U.S. and UN must push the government of Sudan to accept a stronger mandate that allows the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to pro-actively protect civilians. In addition, the U.S. and UN must provide more funding, weapons and equipment and in the long-term, work to successfully transition the mission from the African Union to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

<p>“The African Union has been given the responsibility to protect, but not the power to protect,” said Sally Chin, Advocate for Refugees International, and co-author of No Power to Protect. “The people of Darfur are in serious jeopardy. This force is their last hope and in its current state, it is not capable of delivering.”

<p>The report commends the African Union for stepping into a breach where Western powers have had little appetite to go and noted that earlier this year it had succeeded at providing a modicum of security. With increased assistance and a stronger mandate, AMIS would be able to handle the numerous challenges that it now faces. Yet, the U.S. has offered supportive rhetoric rather than tangible funding for the African Union. Just last week, the House of Representatives refused to honor its pledge of $50 million for AMIS when it cut the funding from the FY 2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. 

<p>“The U.S. has called the situation in Darfur genocide, and has offered up the African Union as the solution to this crisis,” added Ms. Chin. “If it is serious about this, the US needs to do everything in its power to make sure the African Union Mission in Sudan succeeds.” 

<p>The report details that the African Union has been sent to Sudan to monitor and verify the ceasefire between the Government of Sudan and rebel groups in Darfur, but its mandate does not allow AMIS to protect civilians from imminent attack unless troops are present at that very moment. Furthermore, the force is extremely understaffed – there are currently fewer than 5,000 armed troops in Darfur to provide security in an area the size of Texas --  and it is unable to defend itself from attack due to a severe lack of firepower and equipment.

<p>“The African Union Mission in Sudan is out-gunned by the Government of Sudan and the armed factions. If it cannot defend itself, it certainly cannot protect civilians,” said Jonathan Morgenstein, a consultant for Refugees International and co-author of the report. “No one would seriously suggest that 5,000 police officers could maintain security in Texas. The African Union force must immediately be expanded and the US must work with the international community to ensure that these troops have the necessary training and equipment to do their job.”

<p>Despite political sensitivities over transitioning the African Union mission in Darfur to the UN, No Power to Protect argues that the U.S. must lead the discussion on this transition as soon as possible. This is especially necessary because the Government of Sudan is slated to become the next chair of the African Union in January of 2006.  Also, the prospects for peace increasingly look dim. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick is in Sudan this week to move the peace process forward, yet it is unclear whether rebel groups or the Government of Sudan will respect the ceasefire.

<p>The report also details the need for AMIS to improve coordination and information sharing with humanitarian agencies and to make greater outreach efforts to displaced persons. Refugees International found that displaced persons were unclear of the role of the African Union forces, and some stated that they couldn’t tell the difference between an AU soldier and any other soldier in uniform.

<p>No Power to Protect: The African Union Mission in Sudan is based on information that Refugees International obtained while traveling with the African Union in Darfur in September 2005, and through extensive interviews. This was Refugees International’s seventh mission to the region to assess the conflict.
