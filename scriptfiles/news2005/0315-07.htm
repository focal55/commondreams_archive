<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 15 -- Amnesty  International  has  written  to  American Express regarding  its  sponsorship  of  an  event  featuring Narendra Modi, Chief Minister  of  the Indian state of Gujarat.  The Asian-American Hotel Owners Association  (AAHOA)  has  invited Chief  Minister  Modi  to address their conference in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on March 24.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty  International  has  cited the Gujarat authorities, headed by Modi, for  failing  to  protect  Muslims  during violence in February 2002 during which  more  than  2,000  people  died. During the violence, which followed state government officials blaming a train fire on Muslims, several hundred girls  and  women were stripped naked, raped or gang-raped, had their wombs slashed  and were  thrown  into  fires,  some while still alive. The state government took no steps to prevent or stop these widespread and systematic attacks  on  members of the Muslim minority, and during the attacks, policen stood  by  or  even  joined  in  the  violence.   Amnesty International has concluded that many of the abuses constitute crimes against humanity.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Amnesty International's January 2005 report, &quot;India: Justice, the victim -  Gujarat  state  fails  to  protect  women  from violence,&quot; Bilqis Yakoob Rasool, herself a victim of gang-rape who lost 14 family members reported:</font></p><p align="LEFT">      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They  started  molesting  the  girls and tore off their clothes. Our       naked  girls  were  raped in front of the crowd. They killed Shamin's       baby  who  was  two  days  old.  They killed my maternal uncle and my       father's  sister  and  her  husband  too. After raping the women they       killed  all of them... They killed my baby too. They threw her in the       air  and  she hit a rock. After raping me, one of the men kept a foot       on my neck and hit me.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Amnesty  International  takes  no position on whether a particular speaker ought to be invited for a particular event, but American Express should not ignore the consequences of its association with this speech, delivered by a man  who  bears  responsibility  for a climate of fear endured by Gujarat's minorities,&quot; said Govind Acharya, Amnesty International USA's India Country Specialist.   &quot;We  urge  American  Express  to  consider  the  human rights implications  of its relationship to this event, and whether there are more constructive  opportunities for the company's support that would contribute to curtailing violence against women and minorities in India.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
