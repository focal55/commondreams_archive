<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO -- April 14 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the United States enters year three of the War in Iraq, Cinema Libre Studio will release the poignant documentary &#147;Voices in Wartime&#148; in San Francisco at Landmark Lumiere 3 at 1572 California St. in San Francisco on Friday, April 15th. The film will also open in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and Seattle the same day, and will have opened in New York April 8th.  &#147;Voices in Wartime&#148; brings to life how poetry and war have been intertwined since the beginning of recorded history.</font><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Voices In Wartime may prove to be the most startlingly literate document of war ever created for film,&#148; said the San Francisco Bay Guardian.  Through images and words, &#147;Voices in Wartime&#148; sharply etches the psychological injuries suffered by veterans and civilians of war.  &#147;The movie aims to change the way people look at the impact of war,&#148; says the film&#146;s director Rick King (&#147;Road Ends,&#148; &#147;Hard Choices&#148;). &#147;&#145;Voices in Wartime&#146; uses compelling personal stories and powerful, accessible poetry to distill the emotional essence of combat. Making the film, we learned one very clear lesson: In war, everyone pays a price.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through intense images of war, views of war experts and words of poets, the documentary explores the history, heroism, terror and emotional impact of war &#150; from ancient Babylonia to the current conflict in Iraq. The stirring words of poets of the past such as Wilfred Owen, Emily Dickinson and Langston Hughes are combined with more recent voices: a Vietnam vet, poets in war-torn Baghdad and a poet whose family experienced the devastating war in Biafra, Nigeria. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After screening at the 2005 Palm Springs Film Festival and the D.C. Independent Film Festival, Variety stated, &#147;A history of verse is laid alongside that of warfare, and the ways in which they are braided together proves fascinating,&#148; While The Los Angeles Times called &#147;Voices in Wartime&#148; is &#147;A strong, riveting film.&#148;  The film will also be screened as part of the Newport Beach Film Festival in late April.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With April being National Poetry month, combined with the 3rd anniversary of the war &#150; the filmmakers felt this was the ideal time to bring this film to audiences. &#147;The message of &#145;Voices in Wartime&#146; is that nobody escapes war unchanged,&#148; says Andrew Himes, the film&#146;s executive producer. &#147;War has profound consequences for everyone, whether soldiers or civilians in a battle zone, or the families, friends, and communities of those returning from war.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;&#145;Voices in Wartime&#146; has the potential to reach a very large audience, across a broad political spectrum,&#148; says Philippe Diaz, Chairman of Cinema Libre Studio. &#147;That&#146;s important in these polarized times. We all care about healing the wounds of war and supporting returning veterans, no matter how we feel about the war itself.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The film is backed by the non-profit organization Voices in Wartime Network (www.VoicesInWartime.org) which is dedicated to enabling people to engage in a worldwide dialogue to address the collective trauma caused by war. The organization has launched house parties across the nation to facilitate conversations about the impending mental health crisis, released a book entitled &#147;Voices in Wartime Anthology&#148; and created a series of curricula designed to aid high school and college instructors, entitled &#147;Voices in Wartime Education Project.&#148; </i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about the &#147;Voices in Wartime&#148; theatrical opening or for the electronic press kit:</font></i></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.voicesinwartime.org/VoicesInWartime/Film/PressKit/PressKit.aspx" target="_new">http://www.voicesinwartime.org/VoicesInWartime/Film/PressKit/PressKit.aspx</a><br></font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
