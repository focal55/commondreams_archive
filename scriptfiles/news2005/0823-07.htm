<p>BACKGROUND:  U.S. and Ugandan government policies are exacerbating a dramatic condom shortage in Uganda, the African country best known for its successful HIV prevention efforts. Some 32 million quality-approved condoms remain impounded in government warehouses while the U.S. government ramps up financing for abstinence-only approaches to HIV prevention. Religious groups are undermining confidence in condoms throughout the country and contributing to misinformation about their effectiveness. According to Ugandan AIDS activists, the government¹s actions will undermine community efforts to reduce HIV prevalence and HIV transmission. These trends away from scientifically sound, evidence-based prevention strategies are occurring in Uganda and in other countries hard-hit by the AIDS epidemic, such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia.

<p>Activists will brief reporters on:

<p>€    A campaign launched by Ugandan activists, 10 months and counting:
Uganda¹s zero condom policy, protesting the condom crisis and resisting the abstinence-only agenda supported by the Government of Uganda and the Bush Administration.  

<p>€    The rise of anti-condom rhetoric in sub-Saharan Africa, the critical
shortage of condoms in Uganda, and the influence of U.S. President George W. Bush¹s global AIDS policies on programs to prevent HIV.

<p>€    Calls by the Pan-African Treatment Access Movement (PATAM) for African
governments to resist U.S. pressure and ensure that condoms and safer sex messages are supported in HIV-prevention programs.
