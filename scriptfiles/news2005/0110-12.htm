<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 10 -- Concern about the spread of crystal meth use in the African-American community is prompting the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center, Harlem United Community AIDS Center and New York Panthers Leather Club to sponsor a free forum titled The Realities of Crystal Meth for Men of Color, on Wednesday, Jan. 12, 6-8 p.m., at the National Black Theatre, 2031 5th Avenue (between 125th and 126th streets) in New York City.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A decade ago, we watched as cocaine use grew into a crack epidemic in communities of color. With this collaboration and campaign, we are trying to prevent crystal meth use from exploding into an epidemic among men of color,&quot; says Dr. Barbara Warren, who is responsible for research at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center, 208 West 13th Street in New York City; <a href="http://www.gaycenter.org/" target="_new">http://www.gaycenter.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups have also launched a community-awareness campaign comprising compelling posters featuring photos of African-American men, titled &quot;PNP? Party N' Play or Party N' Pay.&quot; The large posters are on telephone kiosks in Harlem, Chelsea and the West Village through January. The campaign is funded via a grant from the New York City Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This crystal campaign is an essential part of Harlem United's mission to promote the health and safety of all persons at risk for HIV/AIDS. There is a grave risk in assuming that crystal is a phenomenon that is limited to the gay white community. The campaign is designed to raise awareness and lay the foundation for effective interventions to address the risks associated with crystal use,&quot; says Patrick McGovern, Harlem United's executive director.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Harlem United Community AIDS Center provides HIV prevention and care services while &quot;uniting the diverse communities of Harlem in order to address all needs of people living with and threatened by HIV and AIDS.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Established in 1983, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center is the largest lesbian and gay community center organization on the East Coast. More than 6,000 people visit the Center weekly and 300 groups meet there.</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media inquiries go to Inga Sarda-Sorensen, the Center's communications director, at 212-620-7310, ext. 230; <a href="mailto:iss@gaycenter.org" target="_new">iss@gaycenter.org</a>.</font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
