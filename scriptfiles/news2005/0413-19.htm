<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 13 -- &quot;Today Canada delivered a plan that begins to address its responsibility to reduce heat trapping emissions that cause global warming.  In contrast, the Bush administration continues to avoid its responsibility, denying the scientific consensus that global warming is an urgent problem, even while Republican governors - from California to New York - demonstrate leadership in the face of national inaction, and some large U.S. power companies-from Duke Energy to Excelon-publicly acknowledge a need to address the issue.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the president prides himself on his firm resolve on international issues, when it comes to global warming he readily yields to the fossil fuel and automotive industries, two of the largest generators of heat trapping gases. This shortsighted focus on near term profits will ultimately rob U.S. companies of economic opportunity-and U.S. workers of jobs-as other countries become the leading providers of clean energy technologies necessary to fuel the 21st century.  Canada joins Europe and Japan in increasing investments in clean energy solutions, as the Bush administration continues a myopic commitment to propping up 20th century polluting technology.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The result of the administration's &quot;can't do&quot; attitude on global warming is evident in many sectors.  For example, the automakers are fighting tooth and nail to avoid a clean car standard in California, but have voluntarily signed up for a California-style standard in Canada-a market similar is size to California.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moving Forward on Climate Change:  A Plan for Honouring our Kyoto Commitment available at: <a href="http://climatechange.gc.ca/kyoto_commitments/" target="_new">http://climatechange.gc.ca/kyoto_commitments/</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
