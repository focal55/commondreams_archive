Most serve not only patients and staff but also visitors and the larger community through on-site cafeterias, vending machines and catering services. The report offers several case studies of hospitals finding ways to offer more fresh food, raised locally or organically, to patients in their rooms, in cafeterias and via on-site farmers markets. Some examples include:</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the U.S., farmers markets and farm stands have operated successfully at medical facilities, including the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, Allen Memorial Hospital in Iowa, and at multiple Kaiser Permanente facilities in California, Oregon, and Hawaii. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Iowa, Bartels Lutheran Home purchases 15 percent of its food from local growers and producers, including beef raised without the use of hormones or antibiotics. </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cancer Treatment Centers of America serves patients in facilities in Illinois and Okalahoma a menu largely of certified organic food, to optimize nutrition and avoid environmental toxins; <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Vermont, Fletcher Allen Medical Center has a new patient menu that focuses on the use of local, fresh food to improve patient health and support local businesses. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In San Antonio, TX, five hospital systems worked together with vending machine companies to provide healthier offerings. <br> </font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s great that hospitals are starting to &#145;walk the talk&#146; when it comes to food. They aren&#146;t just telling people to eat better, but are making quality food more accessible,&#148; says the report&#146;s author Marie Kulick, Senior Associate in IATP&#146;s Food and Health Program. &#147;These leaders are taking impressive steps. We hope others will be inspired to do the same.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kaiser Permanente, in particular, has embraced the concept that improving access to fresh, nutritious foods is just an extension of their core mission. Kaiser Permanente started their first on-site farmers market in 2003. It currently has 14 markets and plan to have 29 in operation by December 2005. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kaiser Permanente farmers market program gives the Oakland, Calif.-based nonprofit integrated health plan a chance to serve not only as a health care provider but also as health promoter, says Loel Solomon, Ph.D., its national director of Community Health Initiatives. &#147;Prevention isn&#146;t just something that happens in the doctor&#146;s office,&#148; Solomon says. &#147;As part of our overall mission to provide total health to our members, the farmers markets are an integrated part of improving the health of the communities we serve.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to profiling successful case studies, the report identifies strategies for overcoming potential hurdles (such as tight budgets and restrictive vendor contracts) for healthcare administrators wanting to serve more local, sustainably produced food in their facilities.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poor diet contributes to death and disease, including obesity and diabetes, heart disease, learning disabilities, neurological disease, food-borne illnesses and some cancers. Eating nutritious, locally and sustainably-grown whole foods, can improve human heath while enhancing the environmental quality and economic vitality of local communities.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is a very exciting trend that not only benefits patients, staff and the community at-large, but gives hospitals a really unique way to set themselves apart from competitors,&#148; says Kulick.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full report can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.iatp.org/foodandhealth" target="_new">www.iatp.org/foodandhealth</a>.</font></i></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy works globally to promote resilient family farms, communities and ecosystems through research and education, science and technology, and advocacy. </font></i></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IATP is a member of Health Care Without Harm - an international coalition of 433 organizations in 52 countries working to transform the health care industry so it is no longer a source of harm to people and the environment. <br></font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
