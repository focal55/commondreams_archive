<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 26 - The Union of Concerned Scientists today urged Congress to reject an energy bill that ignores our oil dependence, fails to promote renewable energy, disregards global warming, and even raises the risk of nuclear terrorism.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the third time in four years, Congress is on the brink of passing an energy bill that will pollute our air and water while costing the average consumer more money,&quot; said Alden Meyer, Director of Strategy and Policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;This bill does virtually nothing to relieve the twin energy burdens on energy consumers -- high gasoline prices and high home energy costs - and adds insult to injury by jeopardizing the security of every American.&quot;  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House conferees ignored overwhelming evidence that renewable energy will save consumers money and stripped the renewable electricity standard (also known as a renewable portfolio standard) from the final bill. The renewable standard, which passed the Senate with bi-partisan support, would have required major electric companies to gradually increase sales of electricity from wind, solar, and other renewable sources from two percent today to about 10 percent by 2020. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The energy bill funnels billions of dollars in taxpayer money to polluting industries while ignoring practical solutions to global warming such as a renewable electricity standard, which would create jobs, spur economic development and save consumers money,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;The legislation also includes a provision that will harm U.S. energy security by increasing our oil dependence. The proposed extension of the &quot;dual-fuel vehicle&quot; loophole in the energy bill will increase our gasoline consumption by 10 billion gallons through 2015, increasing oil demand in 2014 alone by nearly 130,000 barrels per day.*   At the same time, the energy bill ignores conventional technology that could increase fuel economy, generate hundreds of thousands of new jobs, and save consumers billions at the pump.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The small bright spot for vehicles policy is a radically pared down tax credit package for hybrids and other advanced technology vehicles.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most startling aspects of the bill is a provision that would severely weaken export controls on highly enriched uranium, the key ingredient in the most basic nuclear weapons. If terrorists were to acquire about 100 pounds of this material they could fashion a crude but devastating nuclear explosive in short order.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At a time when the threat of nuclear terrorism is growing, Congress should not make it easier for highly enriched uranium to fall into the wrong hands,&quot; said Dr. Ed Lyman, a senior scientist in UCS's Global Security Program. &quot;This reckless provision is reason enough to reject the energy bill.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>*  This loophole allows automakers to receive credit toward meeting fuel economy standards by selling vehicles that have the capability of running on alternative fuel but almost always run on gasoline.</font></p><p></p><p></p><div align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
