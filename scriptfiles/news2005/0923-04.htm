<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 23 - 
<P><EM>Statement of National Organization for Women President Kim 
            Gandy</EM></P>
<P>With a 13-5 vote today, approving <A 
            href="http://lists.now.org/t/242834/149703/1106074/0/">John 
            Roberts</A>' nomination to be chief justice of the United States, 
            members of the Senate Judiciary Committee set a course toward 
            confirming a man whose votes could reverse years of progress for 
            women's rights and civil rights. </P>
<P>As the only woman on the committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
            (Calif.) carried the weight of more than half the country on her 
            shoulders, and she did so with clear reasoning and strong commitment 
            to preserving the rights that today's women have come to expect as 
            their birthright. NOW applauds all of the senators who voted against 
            Roberts in committee: Joe Biden (Del.), Dick Durbin (Ill.), 
            Feinstein, Edward Kennedy (Mass.) and Charles Schumer (N.Y.). </P>
<P>At the same time, NOW members and women's rights supporters 
            everywhere are extremely disappointed in those senators who profess 
            to champion reproductive rights and civil rights yet voted for 
            Roberts in the committee. Democratic Senators Russ Feingold (Wis.), 
            Herb Kohl (Wis.) and Patrick Leahy (Vt.) &#8212; the ranking Democrat on 
            the committee, no less &#8212; turned their backs on women and girls by 
            endorsing the slick attorney who refused to give clear answers to 
            key questions.</P>
<P>What if Roberts is confirmed? In casting his incomprehensible 
            vote in favor of Roberts, Sen. Leahy commented that "only time will 
            tell" whether Roberts has an ideological agenda. Indeed, I believe 
            history will reveal that Roberts' disdain for individual rights and 
            liberties will characterize his term as chief justice, casting a 
            long, dark shadow upon the High Court. </P>
<P>Women will judge this vote harshly as we suffer its consequences 
            in the years and decades to come. Those who lose their rights and 
            liberties in the future, because of Roberts' leadership on the 
            Court, will remember the senators who voted to confirm. If there are 
            decisions that restrict and dismantle our rights, NOW members will 
            remind Senators Leahy, Feingold and Kohl of the opportunity they had 
            to stop an opponent of our fundamental rights from serving a 
            lifetime as chief justice. </P>
<P>The fight is not over yet, of course. We will continue to press 
            every senator-even those who have already voted on the committee-to 
            defend our rights and liberties when the full Senate vote takes 
            place next week. We will never give up &#8212; the stakes are too high. 
            And we will remember each November. </P>
