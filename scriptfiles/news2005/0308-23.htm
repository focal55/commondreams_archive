<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IMMOKALEE/LOUISVILLE -- March 8 --  In a precedent-setting move, fast-food industry leader Taco Bell Corp., a division of Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM), has agreed to work with the Florida-based farm worker organization, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), to address the wages and working conditions of farmworkers in the Florida tomato industry. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taco Bell announced today that it will fund a penny per pound &quot;pass-through&quot; with its suppliers of Florida tomatoes, and will undertake joint efforts with the CIW on several fronts to improve working conditions in Florida's tomato fields.  For its part, the CIW has agreed to end its three-year boycott of Taco Bell, saying that the agreement &quot;sets a new standard of social responsibility for the fast-food industry.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As an industry leader, we are pleased to lend our support to and work with the CIW to improve working and pay conditions for farmworkers in the Florida tomato fields,&quot; said Emil Brolick, Taco Bell president. &quot;We recognize that Florida tomato workers do not enjoy the same rights and conditions as employees in other industries, and there is a need for reform.  We have indicated that any solution must be industry-wide, as our company simply does not have the clout alone to solve the issues raised by the CIW, but we are willing to play a leadership role within our industry to be part of the solution,&quot; Brolick added.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taco Bell has recently secured an agreement with several of its tomato-grower suppliers, who employ the farmworkers, to pass-through the company-funded equivalent of one-cent per pound directly to the workers. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With this agreement, we will be the first in our industry to directly help improve farmworkers' wages,&quot; added Brolick,   &quot;And we pledge to make this commitment real by buying only from Florida growers who pass this penny per pound payment entirely on to the farmworkers, and by working jointly with the CIW and our suppliers to monitor the pass-through for compliance.  We hope others in the restaurant industry and supermarket retail trade will follow our leadership.&quot;  Yum! Brands and Taco Bell will also work with the CIW to help ensure that Florida tomato pickers enjoy working terms and conditions similar to those that workers in other industries enjoy.<br> <br>&quot;We are challenging our tomato suppliers to meet those higher standards and will seek to do business with those who do,&quot; said Jonathan Blum, senior vice president, Yum! Brands.  &quot;We have already added language to our Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure that indentured servitude by suppliers is strictly forbidden, and we will require strict compliance with all existing laws.  Finally, we pledge to aid in efforts at the state level to seek new laws that better protect all Florida tomato farmworkers,&quot; added Blum. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Company indicated that it believes other restaurant chains and supermarkets, along with the Florida Tomato Committee, should join in seeking legislative reform, because &quot;human rights are universal and we hope others will follow our company's lead.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an important victory for farmworkers, one that establishes a new standard of social responsibility for the fast-food industry and makes an immediate material change in the lives of workers.  This sends a clear challenge to other industry leaders,&quot; said Lucas Benitez, a leader of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Systemic change to ensure human rights for farmworkers is long-overdue.  Taco Bell has now taken an important leadership role by securing the penny per pound pass-through from its tomato suppliers, and by the other efforts it has committed to undertake to help win equal rights for farmworkers,&quot; Benitez added. &quot;We now call on the National Council of Churches, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights and other organizations to join the CIW and end their boycott of Taco Bell, and to recognize the Company by supporting its ongoing leadership in our fight against human rights abuses.  But our work together is not done. Now we must convince other companies that they have the power to change the way they do business and the way workers are treated.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives from the Carter Center assisted the discussions and resolution between the two organizations.  &quot;I commend the Coalition of Immokalee Workers for their principled leadership in this very important campaign.  I am pleased Taco Bell has taken a leadership role to help reform working conditions for Florida farmworkers and has committed to use its power to effect positive human rights change.  I now call on others in the industry to follow Taco Bell's lead to help the tomato farmworkers,&quot; said former President Jimmy Carter.<br>Taco Bell Corp., based in Irvine, California, is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, Inc. and the nation's leading Mexican-style quick service restaurant chain serving tacos, burritos, signature Quesadillas, Border Bowls&reg;, nachos and other specialty items. In 2004, Taco Bell purchased approximately 10 million pounds of Florida tomatoes, representing less than one percent of Florida's tomato production. Taco Bell serves more than 35 million consumers each week in more than 6,500 restaurants in the U.S.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CIW is a membership-led organization of agricultural workers based in Immokalee, Florida, that seeks justice for farmworkers and promotes their fair treatment in accordance with national and international labor standards.  Among its accomplishments, the CIW has aided in the prosecution of five slavery operations by the Department of Justice and the liberation of over 1,000 workers.  The CIW uses creative methods to educate consumers about human rights abuses in the U.S. agriculture industry, corporate social responsibility, and how consumers can help workers realize their social change goals. </font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About the Oakland Institute: The Oakland Institute is a non-partisan think tank utilizing research, analysis and advocacy to promote and ensure public participation and fair debate on critical economic and social policy issues that affect peoples' lives.</font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
