PHILADELPHIA - As the reported U.S.  military death toll in Iraq nears the 2,000 mark, the Nobel Peace  Prize-laureate American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) has  launched, &quot;Not One More Death, Not One More Dollar.&quot; The campaign  calls on Congress to end the Iraq War by ending its funding.
<p>   To date, AFSC supporters across the nation have organized more  than 200 events in 44 states to take place the day following the  2,000th reported U.S. military death in Iraq. Events range from  candlelight vigils to the ceremonial ringing of the bells in  memory of the U.S. service people and as many as 100,000 Iraqis  who have lost their lives. The events will begin a push to urge  Congress to use the power of the purse to end the war, bring the  troops home, close U.S. bases in Iraq, and instead fund the human  needs laid bare by Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>   &quot;Not One More Death, Not One More Dollar&quot; is a continuation of  the Quaker organization's ongoing work to humanize the cost of  the war in Iraq. For the past two years, AFSC's acclaimed  memorial exhibit, Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War, has  traveled to more than 70 cities across the country.  The exhibit,  which features a pair of combat boots to represent each U.S.  military death and thousands of shoes to memorialize Iraqi  civilian casualties, has become an internationally recognized  symbol of the ongoing loss of life in Iraq.</p>
<p>   &quot;It's all too easy to become desensitized to the staggering  number of lives lost, and to the equally staggering number of  dollars spent on this war. Our goal with the &quot;Not One More Death,  Not One More Dollar&quot; campaign, as with the Eyes Wide Open  exhibit, is to make clear the human and financial costs of war in  a way that American citizens relate and respond to,&quot; says AFSC's  Michael McConnell, who developed the Eyes Wide Open exhibit.</p>
<p>   Details on the 200-plus events taking place around the country  as part of &quot;Not One More Death, Not One More Dollar&quot; campaign are  available on the AFSC Web site at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=55446&Link=http://www.afsc.org/wagepeace">http://www.afsc.org/wagepeace</a>.  Some events planned are:</p>
<p>   In Texas -- a state that has lost 210 soldiers in Iraq --  Austin organizers will put up 2,000 holiday lights near a wall  with the names of the 2,000 U.S. Military Dead and graphics  representing the Iraqi dead.</p>
<p>   In Ohio -- a state that has lost 92 soldiers in Iraq --  Cleveland organizers will hold signs during rush-hour in downtown  Cleveland that read: &quot;2,000-plus Americans Killed and Counting.  Bring Our Troops Home.&quot;</p>
<p>   In Pennsylvania -- a state that has lost 102 soldiers in Iraq  -- Pittsburgh organizers will hold a silent, candlelight vigil  and a march. All participants will dress in black in mourning for  the deaths of U.S. Soldiers and Iraqi Civilians.</p>
<p>   Lila Lipscomb, whose son Sergeant Michael F. Pederson, was  killed in Iraq on April 2, 2003, will speak at the Lansing,  Michigan event. &quot;Hundreds have died since Bush declared 'mission  accomplished',&quot; Lipscomb says. &quot;As parents, citizens, and  compassionate people, we have to demand that the funding of this  exhausted war stops now, before one more death occurs or one more  dollar is spent.&quot;</p>
<p>   AFSC General Secretary, Mary Ellen McNish, says, &quot;The American  Friends Service Committee believes that there is no military  solution to the Iraq war.  Continued fighting and occupation  promises only further deaths and injuries, more widows and  orphans, more separated families and billions more spent.  The  devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the realities it brought  home about who does and doesn't have access to the American Dream  tells us all how desperately these resources are needed in other  areas.&quot; </p>
<p>   A detailed position statement from AFSC on the Iraq war is  available on the organization's Web site at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=55446&Link=http://www.afsc.org/wagepeace">http://www.afsc.org/wagepeace</a>.</p>
<p>   The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) was the co- recipient of the 1947 Nobel Peace Prize, which honored Quakers'  historic work to relieve the suffering of war.  The Quaker  organization is comprised of people from many faiths and  backgrounds who are committed to social justice, peace and  humanitarian service. Since 1917, AFSC has aided millions of  people around the world through its peace, economic development,  and human rights programs.  AFSC was a leader in the movements to  end the Vietnam War and to dismantle apartheid in South Africa  and remains a leader in international movements for peace and  justice.</p>
