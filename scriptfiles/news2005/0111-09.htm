<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 11 -- ACORN announced today that it is suspending its protests against Jackson Hewitt because the company has entered into serious negotiations with the community group to curtail tax preparation practices that ACORN had criticized as being harmful to low-income families.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since last tax season ACORN has been engaged in an aggressive campaign to force Jackson Hewitt to change its sales practices with Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs) and other products. The campaign has involved protests, picketing, and flyering in front of Jackson Hewitt offices throughout the country to warn customers, and in December ACORN offices presented Jackson Hewitt with a Grinch of the Year Award.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 50 of its markets this tax season Jackson Hewitt has committed to eliminate the application fee they charged customers for a RAL or other product, and the negotiations will include expanding this to the company's other markets. In addition, in all of its markets, Jackson Hewitt has improved the disclosures they give customers and adopted measures advocated for by ACORN.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our Executive Board met this weekend and voted to stop further actions for 30 days while we continue discussions,&quot; said Maude Hurd, ACORN's national president. &quot;We believe that by February 8 we will have an agreement that protects consumers and benefits low-income families.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jackson Hewitt is the second largest tax preparer in the country. Seventy-three percent of Jackson Hewitt's customers make less than $29,000 a year, and 70 percent of their customers buy a RAL or other financial product, in addition to tax preparation. Last year, Jackson Hewitt sold over 2.8 million RALs and other bank products, generating $60 million in revenue.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RALs are short-term loans secured by the recipient's tax refund. Customers are charged extraordinarily high interest rates to get their own tax dollars back from the government just a week or so faster than they otherwise would. ACORN members have been waging a campaign against these overpriced loans, arguing that they are marketed aggressively to those families who can least afford to lose the money. Of the 12.7 million RALs made nationwide in the 2002 tax year, 10.6 million of them -- 83 percent -- were made to low-income households.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This tax season, ACORN will conduct a grassroots door-to-door outreach campaign to help more families claim their Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) benefits, to warn them about high-cost refund loans, and to let them know about free tax preparation sites.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ACORN is the nation's largest community organization of low- and moderate-income families, with over 150,000 member families organized into 700 neighborhood chapters in 60 cities across the country. Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on issues of concern to our members. Their priorities include: better housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for low-wage workers, more investment in our communities from banks and governments, and better public schools. They achieve these goals by building community organizations that have the power to win changes -- through direct action, negotiation, legislation, and voter participation. ACORN is an acronym, and each letter should be capitalized. ACORN stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
