<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  BAD VILBEL, GERMANY -  July 8 - Blair, Chirac, Schroeder&#133; the G8 meets in Gleanagles smiling and whistling the tune of a break-through climate deal. Yet, what is the whistlers&#146; message to the world community? How do they think we are going to tackle a world-wide problem? Business has a key potential to alleviate this problem. It awaits prompt response.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Bush stands isolated in opposing strict curbs on carbon dioxide, the rest of the G8 is, according to Chirac, &#147;heading towards an agreement&#148;. The question is what kind of agreement Chirac refers to. &#147;Voluntary or indicative CO2 emission targets are nothing but cute&#148;, says Sebastian Gallehr, Chief Executive Director of the European Business Council for Sustainable Energy (e5). &#147;Business requires clear rules for success, and clear rules must be mandatory&#147;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001 already, 200 companies from around the globe (including Deutsche Telekom AG, the Gerling Group, Nuon Holding) called for Kyoto-style emission caps when signing the &#145;e-mission 55 &#150; business for climate&acute; initiative launched by GERMANWATCH, WWF and e5. Meanwhile, global players such as GE, BP or Toyota have joint in the advocacy for binding emission targets.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trend in businesses is to take climate change as an opportunity and not a risk. With oil prices surging through $60 a barrel last week, and predictions mounting to $100 by the end of the year, companies increasingly express their will to invest in green technology reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They will easier walk the talk, if a straightforward international climate agreement gives green light to their aspirations. &#147;The e5 message to the G8 States is clear&#148;, affirms Gallehr. &#147;Establish mandatory targets. If not achievable now, then in 12 months at latest&#148;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If everybody accepts that climate change is a big problem (even Bush has done so these days), then also treat it as a big problem&#148;, claims Gallehr. &#147;Neither downtalk climate change nor lament about it. Instead, highlight the potentials, shift R&amp;D resources, provide incentives and reward climate pioneers&#148;. Business will take up the ball.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About the European Business Council for Sustainable Energy (e5)<br>The European Business Council for Sustainable Energy (e5), www.e5.org, is a non-profit trade association and NGO representing the climate protection-related business interests of approximately 120 companies and organisations from across Europe and America. e5&#146;s conviction is that proactive sustainable energy and climate protection policies offer the European economy immense advantages and possibilities.
