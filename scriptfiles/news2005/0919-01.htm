<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->LONDON - September 19 - Greenpeace today stopped the 
Togo-flagged, factory trawler 'Murtosa', from illegally fishing for cod 
in the international section of the Barents Sea known as the 
"Loophole".  Campaigners on board the Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, 
confirmed with the trawler's captain that he was knowingly taking the 
cod with no legal quota and was conducting so-called IUU (Illegal, 
Unregistered, Unreported) fishing, also known as Pirate Fishing.

<p>Activists in inflatable boats took direct action in an effort to 
interrupt the destructive fishing activities of the Murtosa, by boarding 
the trawler and hoisting the pirate flag - the skull and crossbones, 
also known as The Jolly Roger.

<p>"The current level of illegal and unregulated fishing of cod alone in 
the Barents Sea is estimated to be 150,000 tons, about one third of the 
total annual legal quota. We also see evidence of illegal and unreported 
transfers between trawlers and freezer ships of other species such as 
saithe and haddock, as well as undersized fish, " said Brad Smith, a 
marine biologist with Greenpeace Nordic onboard the Esperanza.

<p>Fish caught and often transferred illegally in the Barents Sea are 
primarily destined for markets in the European Union. Factory trawlers 
and freezer ships with IUU fish from the Barents Sea regularly travel to 
the same ports in the U.K., Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands 
to land their catch. Once landed, the fish is mixed with legal fish and 
then sold all over Europe. The authorities in the countries where the 
fish is landed do not have legal obligations to seize cargoes of pirated 
fish or arrest the vessels involved; this is despite information and 
evidence of illegal activities provided to them by the Norwegian 
authorities, which has responsibility for the majority of the Barents Sea. 

<p>"The problem of IUU fishing needs to be addressed at the highest 
international level. The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization is 
meeting today in Estonia and is a perfect setting for making preliminary 
high-level talks on how to effectively get control of pirate fishing," 
says Dimitri Litvinov, Greenpeace Nordic campaigner also onboard 
Esperanza. "In the Murtosa's case, the member countries of the North 
East Atlantic Fisheries Commission receiving fish from the Barents 
region must act together immediately to develop measures (1) to stop 
this piracy of our common resources."

<p>The problem of Pirate fishing is now considered the greatest threat to 
the sustainability of global fisheries by a special task force at the 
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). These 
operations occur because the trawlers can fish and transport, or 
transfer fish to freezer freighters, in international waters such as the 
Norwegian-Russian "loophole" with impunity as no international laws 
govern these regions. These same vessels can then pass through the 
Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone with equal impunity as they are 
flagged in "convenience states" such as Togo, Cambodia, and Georgia, 
states with which Norway has no common inspections agreement.

<p>Greenpeace is calling for the international community to urgently 
develop legally binding, international agreements that strengthen 
enforcement measures to prevent IUU fishing. The most important of these 
is the need for a common inspection regime in ports receiving fish, 
giving local authorities the obligation and right of arrest and seizure 
in cases of documented illegalities.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force the solutions, which are essential to a green and 
peaceful future.

<p>(1) Greenpeace is demanding an immediate stop to all transshipment at 
sea of cod and other fish in the Barents region until such time as:

<p>European states receiving fish from the Barents develop a legally- 
binding, multilateral agreement that strengthens port-state enforcement 
measures, including a common inspection regime and a  shared information 
database for vessels fishing and transporting fish on the Arctic high 
seas and the Norwegian/Russian EEZ.

<p>An internationally agreed upon set of transfer areas for the 
transshipment of legally caught fish from trawlers to freezer ships is 
demarcated in the region, allowing effective monitoring and control by 
the relevant authorities.

<p>A single, centralized, compatible Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) for all 
vessels licensed to fish or transport fish, on the Arctic high seas or 
the Norwegian/ Russian EEZs is established. Vessels unable to provide 
license and VMS data for any part of their voyage would not be permitted 
to land their catch or cargo of fish.
