<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 13 -- The following is a statement of Otton Solis, economist, former Costa Rican Minister of Planning and Economic Policy and presidential candidate representing Costa Rica's Citizens Action Party, with the occasion of the hearings for Congressional Approval of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in Washington:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;CAFTA will increase poverty in Central America because it will displace farmers and industrial workers and will increase the cost of health care. Far from encouraging improvements in environmental protection standards it does not even guarantee enforcement of current legislation. Additionally, it places insurmountable obstacles for any Central American country that might wish to harness foreign investment compatible with its development goals. That is why the Citizens Action Party is requesting a renegotiation of CAFTA.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After more than 20 years of close trade relations between the US and Central America through the Congressionally mandated Caribbean Basin Initiative, CAFTA fails to recognize the significant development needs and challenges still facing our region. Instead, it fully opens up our agricultural and industrial markets, forcing our countries to compete on a non- level playing field. Our farmers will be unable to compete with subsidized US exports, and our governments will loose the policy flexibility to promote food security and rural development. At the same time, CAFTA opens up our industrial markets without allowing us to protect infant industries and does not include a cent of cooperation, for instance, in order to promote technological development.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;None of the rich countries pursued such type of policies during their development process. Even today they maintain fine- tuned protections and promotion policies for certain activities. Why should Central America be forced to put in place policies that neither theory nor history support?</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For Costa Rica, CAFTA's approach to environmental protection is particularly troublesome, as the agreement does not require all environmental legislation to be enforced and could allow for the weakening of some environmental legislation. Far from receiving recognition for our long-time commitment to the environment, our country is the big looser. Our higher standards will push investors into other countries in search of cheaper environmental protection budgets. CAFTA's approach to the protection of labor rights is similarly troublesome. Our economic growth and unemployment rates will endure the costs.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Costa Ricans have similar concerns when it comes to CAFTA's treatment of the labor market. While CAFTA opens our countries to foreign investment, requiring national treatment for foreign investors, it maintains a closed labor market in the U.S. CAFTA guarantees freedom of movement for capital but not for labor. It opens our labor markets to the entry of businesspeople, while failing to legalize the labor status of the Central Americans that have been working and paying taxes in the U.S. for many years. What happened to market forces? Aren't they the appropriate tool for the labor market?</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Intellectual property rules in CAFTA will have a negative effect on public health. CAFTA extends the monopoly rights of pharmaceutical companies that will delay or limit the introduction of generic competition. These intellectual property rules go beyond WTO obligations and will prevent our countries from making full use of safeguards provided under the TRIPS Agreement that ensure the primacy of public health over patent rights.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Furthermore, rather than enhancing democracy, CAFTA weakens our democratically built judicial institutions by creating supra- national mechanisms for US companies to bypass our courts and sue governments when they believe their profits are being harmed by regulations.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that CAFTA could be good for all if renegotiated to improve environmental protection tools, support local democracy, protect public health and shield infant industries. We should compliment the efforts of our trade negotiators with a broader view of Central American development needs and of the long-term.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope that Americans with a long-term vision and their elected representatives will agree and join us in our effort to seek a better chance for development and the environment in our region. World events during the last fours years show the overwhelming case for the importance of values such as respect and solidarity as guidelines for the build-up of lasting friendships.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
