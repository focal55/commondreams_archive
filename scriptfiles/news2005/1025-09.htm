<p>   WASHINGTON - The following was  released today by Military Families Speak Out and Gold Star  Families for Peace: </p>
<p>   As we pass another horrific milestone, the 2,000th troop death  in Iraq, families with loved ones who are serving in Iraq,  families whose loved ones were killed in Iraq and families whose  loved ones may deploy or re-deploy are calling on the Bush  Administration, Congress and decision-makers at all levels to  honor the fallen and prevent future deaths by ending the  occupation of Iraq, bringing our troops home now and taking care  of them when they get here.</p>
<p>   These families, members of Military Families Speak Out (MFSO)  and of Gold Star Families for Peace (GSFP), are asking local,  state, and national politicians to speak out against the U.S.  occupation of Iraq. Two and one-half years after the war began,  the violence continues to escalate, with almost three U.S.  servicemen and women (on average) dying each day, along with  countless Iraqi children, women and men.</p>
<p>   Gold Star Families, in speaking out about their loved ones who  have been killed in Iraq, demonstrate the true human cost of this  war. Military Families with loved ones currently deployed to  Iraq, show the urgency by which it must end. "Each day I wake up  is a potential nightmare, as I dread that knock on my door that  far too many families have already received," said MFSO member  Anne Roesler, whose son in the 82nd Airborne Division is serving  his third deployment to Iraq. "The fear I live with is a fact of  life for military families with loved ones deployed in a war that  should never have happened. It is a reality that far too few  politicians understand."</p>
