<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WASHINGTON - September 15 - Delta Airlines and Northwest Airlines, during bankruptcy proceedings, must work fairly with their employees, and not use bankruptcy as a cover to shed workers’ pensions and responsibilities to loyal employees.
<p>The Bush Administration has seen this crisis coming, and has refused to take steps to shore up the airline industry. It fought providing airline transportation stabilization funding, hasn’t addressed our nation’s pensions crisis, and has not built a more forward-looking energy policy. 

<p>The result is that the airline industry is going through the most turbulent time in its history - - a situation now exacerbated by the spiraling cost of fuel. But it is wrong to force airline workers to shoulder the full burdens of this troubled industry. 

<p>America’s airline workers make our nation’s air transportation system run, day in and day out. They have worked through one of the most challenging periods in the history of air travel, absorbing shock after shock, and they should be treated as full partners.
