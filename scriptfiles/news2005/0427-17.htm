<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 27 -- </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOWARD ZINN, <a href="mailto:hzinn2@yahoo.com" target="_new">hzinn2@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0122-01.htm" target="_new">http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0122-01.htm</a>, <a href="http://howardzinn.org/" target="_new">http://howardzinn.org</a>    Thursday marks the 30th anniversary of the withdrawal of the U.S. military from Vietnam. Zinn's 1967 book &quot;Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal&quot; argued for the U.S. to pull its troops out of Southeast Asia. He said today: &quot;The U.S. is not doing any good with its military in Iraq. It's not bringing liberty or human rights or democracy. The military presence there is clearly hindering self-determination for the Iraqi people, doing great violence and damage to that nation.&quot; Zinn is also an author of the just-released &quot;Voices of a People's History of the United States.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARCUS RASKIN, [via Joia Jefferson Nuri, <a href="mailto:joia@ips-dc.org" target="_new">joia@ips-dc.org</a>], <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/" target="_new">http://www.ips-dc.org</a> <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CARL LeVAN, <a href="mailto:clevan@ucsd.edu" target="_new">clevan@ucsd.edu</a>    Raskin and LeVan are co-editors of the new book &quot;In Democracy's Shadow: The Secret World of National Security.&quot; LeVan said today: &quot;American democracy is decaying because freedom has been mortgaged to bear the costs of empire. The popular understanding of democracy in America has been betrayed by a reorganization of power and authority that contradicts and undermines the very purpose of legitimate government.&quot;    Raskin is author of numerous books, including the co-authored &quot;Washington Plans an Aggressive War&quot; about the Vietnam War. He co-founded the Institute for Policy Studies in 1963 and is a former member of the National Security Council staff. He said today: &quot;For decades powerful bureaucrats have enjoyed special protections from checks and balances, the executive branch has received a virtual blank check to wage war and the freedoms of citizens have continued to be abbreviated.&quot;    Raskin and LeVan will be participating in an event on Capitol Hill on Thursday in Rayburn Room 2168 (Gold Room), 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., featuring a panel on &quot;The Logic of Withdrawal: Strategies for Ending the Iraq War.&quot; Others scheduled to speak at the event include Rep. John Conyers and Daniel Ellsberg.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
