LONDON - September 30 - Amnesty International has learned that three staff-members of Sudan Development Organisation working in Darfur were kidnapped at 1pm yesterday. Three armed men in civilian clothes took manager Salah Idris, field monitor Salim Mohamed Salim, and accountant Ahmed Musa Nahar from their clinic at Zam Zam Internally Displaced Persons camp in North Darfur.

<p>The whereabouts of the three aid workers is unknown and there are serious concerns for their safety. The kidnappers also took with them the aid workers' vehicle, in which a considerable amount of money -- the clinic staff's end of month salaries -- was being carried. 

<p>Amnesty International condemns the actions of their kidnappers and calls for the immediate safe return of the aid workers.
