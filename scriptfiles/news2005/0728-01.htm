<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> July 28 - Responding to the recent announcement by the USA of a six nation 'pact'  on climate change, Greenpeace Climate Campaigner Stephanie Tunmore said:  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pact, rather than saving the climate, is nothing more than a trade  agreement in energy technologies between the countries in question. It  is entirely voluntary and does not even mention greenhouse gas emissions  reductions. The best option to cope with climate change is to increase  energy efficiency and invest in renewable energy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Unfortunately, it seems likely that Mr Bush and Mr Howard are seeking to  protect the interests of their domestic fossil fuel industries and to  deflect criticism for their total failure to address climate change.  Following such a strategy could wreak untold harm on the most vulnerable  - many of whom are living in the very region from which this absurd pact  was issued.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Up to 70-80% of global emissions must be reduced by industrialised  countries by mid-century in order to avoid catastrophic climate change.  Voluntary technology agreements, negotiated by the world's worst  polluters, are not going to get us there.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">152 countries have now ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which contains  legally binding emissions cuts for industrialized countries for the  period from 2008-2012 (the first commitment period) and negotiations for  the second and subsequent commitment begin in earnest later this year in  Montreal. This 'pact' looks like yet another attempt by the US and  Australia to derail these negotiations and condemn future generations to  a world ravaged by climate change.</font></p><p></p><p></p><div align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
