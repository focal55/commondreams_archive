<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 8 - On November 8, the Kansas Board of Education, led by a conservative Christian majority, is expected to approve new statewide science standards that encourage students to question the validity of evolution.  The anticipated ruling has outraged scientists, teachers and parents who do not want to see children’s science education weakened. 

 

<P>The Campaign to Defend the Constitution, an online grassroots movement to combat the threat posed by the religious right to American democracy, will encourage its 25,000 members to e-mail Kansas school board chairman Steve Abrams, expressing deep concern over the expected decision to change Kansas’ science education standards.

 

<P>The Campaign has already encouraged over 5,000 scientists, clergy and concerned Americans to write to all 50 governors asking them to protect science education in public school classrooms and launched a $200,000 online advertising campaign to urge protection of science education.  Today it will be releasing a new online Flash advertisement highlighting the potential impact of the religious right on education.

 

<P>Join us for a teleconference call on Tuesday with teachers and scientists on the front lines to discuss the implications of the Kansas school board decision.
