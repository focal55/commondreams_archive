<p>NEW YORK - November 30 - The United States is holding at least 
twenty-six persons as "ghost detainees" at undisclosed locations 
outside of the United States, Human Rights Watch said today, as it 
released a list naming some of the detainees. The detainees are being 
held indefinitely and incommunicado, without legal rights or access to 
counsel.

<p>Many of the detainees listed are suspected of involvement in serious 
crimes, including the September 11, 2001, attacks; the 1998 U.S. 
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania; and the 2002 nightclub 
bombings in Bali, Indonesia. One of the detainees listed was indicted 
in U.S. federal court for his role in the 1998 embassy bombings. None 
of the detainees has been arraigned or charged with any crime. 
Officials in the U.S. government, speaking anonymously to journalists, 
have suggested that some detainees have been tortured or otherwise 
seriously mistreated in custody.   
  
<p>"President Bush speaks about bringing terrorists to justice, yet not one 
of these suspects has actually been brought to justice," said John 
Sifton, terrorism and counterterrorism researcher for Human Rights 
Watch. "The Bush administration has severely compromised the 
chances of prosecuting terrorist suspects by holding them illegally, and 
reportedly subjecting some of them to torture and other mistreatment." 
  
  
<p>Indefinite incommunicado detention and torture are illegal under 
international human rights law and the laws of war, and the 
mistreatment of detainees could subject U.S. officials to criminal 
liability.
