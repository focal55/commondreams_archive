<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 16 -- Public Campaign Action Fund, a non-partisan organization, announced today the launching of a new campaign and website <a href="http://www.WithoutDelay.org/" target="_new">http://www.WithoutDelay.org</a> -- calling on U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) to resign from Congress.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WithoutDeLay.org is bringing together citizens around the country who believe Rep. DeLay must be held accountable for his abusive political tactics, questionable ethics, and slavish service to big money donors and lobbyists at the expense of ordinary Americans.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Golf trips to St. Andrews and junkets to the Marianna Islands paid for by corporate donations washed through non-profit organizations are not only unethical but could be illegal,&quot; said David Donnelly, political director of Public Campaign Action Fund. &quot;Our politicians should be beholden only to regular voters and not well heeled lobbyists who foot the bill for green fees and five-star hotel rooms.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tom DeLay auctions policy to the highest bidder without remorse,&quot; continued Donnelly. &quot;He's a walking scandal-- from the alleged laundering of hundreds of thousands in illegal corporate contributions in his home state of Texas to past admonishments by the Ethics Committee in Congress and almost daily revelations of new violations emerging on Capitol Hill. Tom DeLay should do the right thing and resign from not only his leadership post but from his Congressional seat as well.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Public Campaign Action Fund launched WithoutDeLay.org so that the American people can have a voice in this process and show Members of congress that they care about this issue.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the latest news, commentary and analysis, go to Public Campaign Action Fund's blog, &quot;The Daily DeLay&quot; at <a href="http://dailydelay.blogspot.com/" target="_new">http://dailydelay.blogspot.com</a>. Donnelly can be reached at 617- 524-2330 (direct) or 617-899-1084 (cell).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Public Campaign Action Fund is a national nonprofit organization that works to hold elected officials accountable for the big money politics, and supports effort to enact comprehensive reforms of our political system.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
