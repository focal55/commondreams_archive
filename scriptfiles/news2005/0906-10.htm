<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - September 6 - 
<p>U.S. Representative Lynn Woolsey (D-Petaluma) is calling on Members of Congress and the President to work together to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq, while helping the Iraqis regain control over their country and their future.  

<p><b>What</b>:  Hearing on the Future of Iraq 

<p><b>When</b>: Thursday, September 15, 2005 
        10:00 AM - 1:00 PM (may change once location is determined) 

<p><b>Who</b>:   U.S. Representative Lynn Woolsey 
<br>
<br>
Witnesses include: 

<p><b>U.S. Senator Max Cleland</b>, former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, former head of the Veterans Administration and triple amputee from his military service in the Vietnam War. 

<p><b>General Joseph Hoar</b> (Ret. USMC), former Commander in Chief of U.S. Central Command. 
<p><b>Ambassador David Mack</b>, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, and current Vice President of the Middle East Institute.

<p><b>Dr. Ken Katzman</b>, Middle East analyst and Iraq specialist at the Congressional Research Service. 

<p><b>Tom Hayden</b>, former California State Senator and experienced negotiator in Northern Ireland. 
Anas Shallal, an Iraqi-American and founder of  "Iraqi-Americans for Peaceful Alternatives."
  

<p><b>Where</b>:  TBD 

<p>Rep. Lynn Woolsey was the first Member of Congress to call on the President to develop and implement a plan to bring U.S. troops out of Iraq.  She has requested hearings in the U.S. House International Relations Committee and the U.S. House Armed Services Committee over the last eight months to discuss plans to bring the troops home while helping the Iraqis regain control over their country and their future.   

<p>Since her requests of the President and the Republican controlled Congress have been ignored, she is organizing an informal hearing because she believes the American people deserve to learn about strategies to achieve military disengagement while still playing a constructive role in the rebuilding of Iraqi society.
