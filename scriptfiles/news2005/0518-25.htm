<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than one-third of prime-age minimum wage workers remain in low-wage
jobs for at least three years, according to a new study by the Center for
Economic and Policy Research (CEPR).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, &quot;No Way Out: How Prime-Age Workers Get Trapped in Minimum Wage
Jobs,&quot; shows that prime-age workers (ages 25 to 54) get stuck in minimum
wage jobs, especially during periods of relatively high unemployment and limited
wage growth. Most minimum wage workers are between the ages of 25 and 54, and a
minimum wage earner provides, on average, 68 percent of their total family
income.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
While prior research has focused on whether all U.S. workers are likely to move
out of minimum wage jobs, the CEPR study focused on prime-age workers. It found
that 36.6 percent of prime-age workers in minimum wage jobs are still earning
minimum wage after three years. The probability of moving out of a minimum wage
job was higher for men, native-born citizens, those with union jobs, and those
that change occupations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Moving into a job that pays more than the minimum wage is critical for
families trying to become part of the middle class,&quot; said Heather Boushey,
CEPR economist and author of the study. &quot;However, many prime-age minimum
wage workers remain stuck in low-wage jobs.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The minimum wage has not been increased since 1997. Since then, although the
minimum wage has remained at $5.15 in nominal terms, its value has fallen by
nearly a sixth in inflation-adjusted terms. A full-time, full-year worker at the
minimum wage earns just $10,300, putting them below the poverty threshold of
$13,020 for a one-parent, one-child family. Further, most workers employed at or
near the minimum wage are not offered (or cannot afford) health insurance from
their employer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Senator Edward Kennedy and Rep. George Miller are introducing legislation today
that would raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. &quot;The Fair Minimum Wage
Act of 2005&quot; would raise the minimum wage in three steps: 1) $5.85: 60 days
after enactment; 2) $6.55: one year later; and 3) $7.25: one year after that.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Boushey recommends that policymakers who want to focus on eradicating poverty
should create policies that generate high levels of employment and low
unemployment, which will provide more opportunities for low-wage workers to move
up the job ladder and put pressure on wages at the low end, as occurred during
the late 1990s.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Minimum wage, a policy designed to ensure an adequate floor for wages, has
eroded so much that it is now something to be escaped,&quot; said Boushey.
&quot;Unfortunately, many adults are not able to escape minimum wage work,
especially if they are female, non-native, or not lucky enough to have a union
job.&quot;</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
