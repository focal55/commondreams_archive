<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 5 -- Rick Lass, the New Mexico coordinator for Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb, will be joined by an expert in mathematics and<br>statistical analysis and Dr. Sonja Elison, Albuquerque coordinator for the recount effort, in a press conference to be held on Wednesday, January 5, at Noon, at the Albuquerque Press Club, 201 Highland Park Drive SE.  The speakers will discuss the CPA report, commissioned by the New Mexico Secretary of State's office, which found numerous errors and discrepancies with the counting and reporting of New Mexico's presidential vote, and the unusually high rate of voting irregularities which took place in Bernalillo County.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There were an unprecedented and disproportionate number of problems with the presidential vote in Bernalillo County.  A recount will help us get to the bottom of these problems and help prevent them from happening again in the next election,&quot; said Rick Lass.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Mexico resident Bob Walsh, a statistical expert with experience in auditing calculations, will be one of the speakers at the press conference.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recount, requested by David Cobb and Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik, is the subject of pending litigation before the New Mexico Court of Appeals.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Problems with the New Mexico presidential election included malfunctioning voting machines and an unusually high number of under-votes (ballots cast with no votes for president) and &quot;phantom&quot; votes (more votes for president recorded than actual voters).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about the Cobb-LaMarche campaign and its recount efforts in Ohio and New Mexico, see &lt;<a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>&gt;.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
