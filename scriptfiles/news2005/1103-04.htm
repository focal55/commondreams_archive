<P>Washington - In its first restructuring under Administrator 
            Stephen Johnson, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is 
            creating a new &#8220;national security and intelligence&#8221; operation, 
            according to an agency email released today by Public Employees for 
            Environmental Responsibility (PEER). At the same time, EPA would 
            eliminate the Office of Children&#8217;s Health Protection and bury its 
            function inside an environmental education bureau.</P>
            <P>&#8220;It is not clear why the Environmental Protection Agency needs 
            its own clandestine service,&#8221; stated PEER Executive Director Jeff 
            Ruch. &#8220;This appears to be yet another move to take the &#8216;E&#8217; out of 
            EPA.&#8221;</P>
            <P>The October 28 th restructuring announcement states with respect 
            to the new intelligence function &#8211;</P>
            <P>&#8220;Creating an Intelligence Operations function within the Office 
            of Homeland Security to advise the Administrator and other senior 
            EPA officials on matters related to national security and 
            intelligence; to serve as the principal Agency liaison to the U.S. 
            intelligence community; and to coordinate with EPA programs and 
            Regions on matters related to classified and other sensitive 
            information.&#8221; </P>
            <P>&#8220;The term &#8216;sensitive information&#8217; denotes that EPA is creating a 
            new category of secret information apart from the current security 
            classification system; a development that further erodes the 
            public&#8217;s right to know what is happening in our environment,&#8221; Ruch 
            added. </P>
            <P>The reorganization also abolishes the Office of Children&#8217;s Health 
            Protection and transfers its work to an expanded environmental 
            education unit. Established in 1997, the Office of Children&#8217;s Health 
            Protection is supposed to ensure that the special vulnerability of 
            children is safeguarded in environmental standard-setting, 
            enforcement and prevention efforts. </P>
            <P>Johnson&#8217;s own role in childhood health issues was brought into 
            stark relief during his confirmation hearings over his advocacy of 
            using children in pesticide dosing experiments. Although Johnson 
            cancelled one controversial study (with the anomalous acronym of 
            CHEERS) in which parents were to be paid to spray pesticides in the 
            room primarily occupied by their infant children, he did so in the 
            face of threats by Democratic senators to block his confirmation. 
            Since then, Johnson has heatedly defended CHEERS and is pushing a 
            plan to allow children to be used in other chemical dosing 
            experiments. </P>
            <P>&#8220;Stephen Johnson is making it clear that he does not want to hear 
            another peep out of child health advocates within his agency,&#8221; Ruch 
            added, noting that putting child health under environmental 
            education represents a serious de-emphasis. &#8220;This move is only 
            slightly better than putting children&#8217;s health in the janitor&#8217;s 
            closet, given the importance EPA assigns to environmental 
            education.&#8221;
