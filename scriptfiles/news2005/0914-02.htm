<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->NEW YORK - September 13 - MADRE, an international women&#8217;s 
human rights organization, is working with the Louisiana Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence (LCADV) to protect survivors of domestic violence and child 
abuse who have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina.
<P>As a result of the hurricane, all direct services for survivors of domestic 
violence in the Gulf Coast region were suspended. Several women&#8217;s shelters were 
completely destroyed, and others were forced to evacuate. Thousands of women and 
children who were in those shelters now require urgent assistance. And many more 
women now face an increased threat of rape and battering.</P>
<P>The LCADV reports that many women are afraid to register with the Red Cross 
for fear that their batterers will use the registry to find them. And the LCADV 
has received reports that women are being battered by their partners in the 
emergency shelters set up since the hurricane.</P>
<P>MADRE Executive Director Vivian Stromberg commented: &#8220;Violence against women 
tends to surge in the wake of disasters, as abusers react to their own trauma 
with violence and struggle to reassert control in the face of chaos and 
loss.&nbsp; We are seeing this happen in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why MADRE is supporting the Louisiana Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence, an organization that is rooted in the communities directly 
affected by the hurricane.&#8221;</P>
<P>The LCADV is using the funds it raises to relocate domestic violence 
survivors displaced by the hurricane; purchase basic necessities, such as baby 
formula, food, diapers, and clothing; pay for medical treatment and prescription 
medications; and pay for car repairs, gas, and public transportation to bring 
women and their children to safe housing in other communities.</P>
