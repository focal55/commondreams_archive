<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 14 -- Despite a mass shooting in Brookfield, Wisconsin, on Saturday in which a gunman killed seven people, wounded four more, and then committed suicide, a subcommittee of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee is scheduled tomorrow to take the first step toward passing legislation to grant the firearms industry protection from some civil lawsuits. The &#147;Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act&#148; (H.R. 800) would shield the gun industry from liability for suits that arise when a gun dealer&#146;s or manufacturer&#146;s actions contribute to gun violence. The gun industry already enjoys an exemption from federal health and safety oversight.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is unfathomable that Congress plans to move forward with legislation to protect the gun industry just days after a mass shooting. Congress should instead be looking at measures to prevent future mass shootings, including health and safety regulation of the gun industry,&#148; states Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy Center.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday, March 15, the House Judiciary Committee&#146;s Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law will hold a hearing on H.R. 800, the first step toward bringing the legislation to a vote on the House floor. Representative James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) chairs the full Judiciary Committee and his district includes Brookfield, where the shooting took place.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legislation similar to H.R. 800 passed the House last Congress, but stalled in the Senate when pro-gun control amendments were added.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Violence Policy Center is a national non-profit educational foundation that conducts research on violence in America and works to develop violence-reduction policies and proposals. The Center examines the role of firearms in America, conducts research on firearms violence, and explores new ways to decrease firearm-related death and injury.</font></i></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
