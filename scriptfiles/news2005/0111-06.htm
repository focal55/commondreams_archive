<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 11 -- The following was released today by The UUSC Committee on the &quot;Salvador Option&quot; proposed by the Pentagon:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC), wishes to express its profound opposition to the &quot;Salvador Option&quot; now proposed by the Pentagon for utilization in Iraq. We remember with great clarity and pain the horrors inflicted upon the people of Central America by the U.S.-backed death squads throughout the 1980s. This shameful and deadly chapter of our history must never be repeated.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If we are serious about freedom for Iraq, then we must, at all costs, protect its citizenry from all acts of torture, terror and assassination. Democracy imposed by us at gunpoint is poorly disguised tyranny indeed. On moral grounds alone, we must categorically reject the use of U.S.-sponsored death squads. Torture and terror by proxy is still torture and terror.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The devastation inflicted by the U.S.-backed army death squads in Central America is well documented. In El Salvador during the 1980s these units were responsible, for example, for the murders of Archbishop Oscar Romero and tens of thousands of civilians, including union members, peasant leaders, physicians, and anyone working with the poor. In Guatemala, the 200,000 victims of the army and its death squads included Bishop Juan Gerardi and Rosario Godoy de Cuevas, a young mother raped and killed in 1985 together with her 19-year-old brother and two- year-old son. The baby's fingernails were torn out as a warning to others. The U.S. support for the Guatemalan death squads was sharply criticized by the U.N. Truth Commission report in 1999. In both countries, civilian institutions were dangerously weakened, and the rule of law was lost. Can we seriously call these results the building blocks of democracy for Iraq?</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Engaging in death squad activities is not merely immoral but also highly illegal. Such acts are prohibited by numerous international treaties, including the Convention Against Torture, the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions (which protects civilian saboteurs), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The right to life, freedom from torture and kidnapping, and a fair trial are sacrosanct. Our domestic laws, including the War Crimes Act and the anti-torture statute confirm these values and make conspiracy to carry out such actions a felony.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Last but not least, we must remember that violence will always beget violence. Already, the U.S. detainee abuses are unifying the Islamic world against us. Sadly, it is our young service men and women who may pay the price, but civilians are endangered as well. Sowing the seeds of hatred and terror will leave us with a long and bitter harvest indeed to reap.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>For information contact, Jennifer Harbury, 800-388-3920, 512-751-5852 (cellular), or at <a href="Mailto:jharbury@hotmail.com" target="_new">jharbury@hotmail.com</a>.
