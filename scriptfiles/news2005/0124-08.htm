<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 24 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation&#146;s leading advocacy organization for personal privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose, issued the following statement regarding the anti-choice protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court today in Washington, DC.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The million-plus people who marched for women's freedom and privacy last spring represent the American mainstream a lot better than the small number of fringe activists who came to D.C. today. And if George Bush tries to pack the Supreme Court with out-of-touch far-right judges who want to take away our rights, he's going to hear from that pro-choice majority loud and clear.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are dedicated to making sure that Roe v. Wade outlives the next four years of George W. Bush. We will defend women's right to control their own bodies and lives by taking our message on the values of personal privacy and women&#146;s freedom to every part of America.&#148;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
