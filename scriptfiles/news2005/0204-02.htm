<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 4  -- The following is a  statement of Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer on 'Bloodless  Coup' at the House Ethics Committee:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The House Republican leadership continued its efforts to shut  down ethics enforcement in the House this week with a &quot;bloodless  coup&quot; at the House Ethics Committee. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   After House Republican leaders put through a change in the  ethics rules last month to make it much harder to get ethics  complaints considered by the Ethics Committee, House Speaker  Dennis Hastert on Wednesday, in effect, fired the Ethics Committee  Chairman Joel Hefley for doing his job. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Hefley was replaced by Representative Doc Hastings, who was a  member of the Ethics Committee and is considered to be close to  Speaker Hastert.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   According to yesterday's Washington Post, Hefley believes he  was removed because he was too independent. &quot;There is 'a bad  perception out there that there was a purge in the committee and  that people were put in that would protect our side of the aisle  better than I did,'&quot; Hefley said, according to the Post.  &quot;Nobody  should be there to protect anybody. They should be there to  protect the integrity of the institution,&quot; Hefley stated,  according to the article.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   In addition to removing Hefley, Speaker Hastert dropped two of  the four other Republicans on the Ethics Committee this week.  Amazingly, with an important ethics charge still pending at the  Ethics Committee against House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Speaker  Hastert named Representatives Lamar Smith and Tom Cole to the  Committee -- both of whom reportedly have made substantial  contributions to DeLay's legal defense fund during the past seven  months. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   It is extraordinarily inappropriate and a clear conflict of  interest for Smith and Cole to serve on the Ethics Committee under  these circumstances. With well over 200 House Republicans to  choose from, the appointment of these two Representatives to the  Ethics Committee sends a loud and clear message to the American  people that House Republican leaders have no interest in treating  ethics matters seriously and no concern about the House's public  credibility.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Meanwhile the &quot;bloodless coup&quot; at the House Ethics Committee  apparently is not over. Ethics Committee staff appear to be next  in line for ouster. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   An article in yesterday's Roll Call states, &quot;According to GOP  sources, the Republican leadership may also seek the ouster of  John Vargo, the panel's staff director.&quot; The article says, &quot;'I  wouldn't be surprised to see Vargo replaced,' said a senior House  GOP aide. 'He's to blame for the mess, too. He's the top  professional staffer on the committee, and they were out of  control last year.'&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The message from that statement is clear and outrageous: the  unanimous and bipartisan House Ethics Committee was &quot;out of  control&quot; last year because they admonished Representative DeLay  for ethical improprieties in three different instances.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Presumably this means the Ethics Committee was out of Hastert  and DeLay's control, which is precisely how it should be. If  Majority Leader DeLay wants to stop the House Ethics Committee  from holding him accountable for unethical conduct, he ought to  stop engaging in unethical conduct.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The performance of the House Republican leadership in this  Congress on ethics matters is an affront to the American people  and an irresponsible disregard of their institutional  responsibilities.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Without enforcement of the ethics rules, there are no ethics  rules. Instead the House is left with the lowest common- denominator behavior setting the ethics standards for all House  Members. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   This cannot be accepted.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Democracy 21, working with others, will fight every step of the  way the effort by House Republican leaders to do away with ethics  enforcement, and thereby ethics standards, in the House.</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><div align="CENTER"></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
