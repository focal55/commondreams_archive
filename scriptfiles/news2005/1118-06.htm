<p>CAPETOWN, South Africa - November 18 - We are facing a growing wave 
of ocean extinction; our seas have reached a tipping point, with scores 
of species, fish, birds and mammals edging toward extinction (1). In 
response, Greenpeace is launching its most ambitious ship expedition 
ever to defend our oceans and to call for a vast network of marine 
reserves that are needed to protect and restore the health of the 
planets oceans (2).

<p>The expedition will begin this weekend when two Greenpeace ships, the MY 
Esperanza and the MY Arctic Sunrise, leave Cape Town to oppose continued 
whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.

<p>Flying in the face of international protest and repeated calls from the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) to stop the annual hunt, this 
year the Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) intends to more than double its 
catch of minke whales to 935. Adding insult to injury this year 10 fin 
whales will also be caught in the harpooner’s sights. Next year 40 more 
fin whales will be added along with 50 humpback whales. Both are 
recognised as endangered species.

<p>“Even though the ban on commercial whaling has been agreed, the 
international community has failed to stop the hunt. Starting with the 
easiest whales to catch, vast whaling fleets have pushed one species 
after another to the brink of extinction. Greenpeace is heading once 
more to the Sanctuary to defend the whales and call for an immediate end 
to the hunt” said Shane Rattenbury, head of Greenpeace’s Oceans 
Campaign. “The persecution of the great whales is a tragic echo of what 
is happening throughout our oceans,” Rattenbury added.

<p>Every second breath we take comes from the oceans – they give the planet 
half of its oxygen. In return we suffocate them with pollution, warm 
them with climate change and empty them of fish. Countless factory ships 
scour and devour all life in their path with destructive techniques like 
bottom trawling. It is time to face facts, time to begin defending our 
oceans. “Only through establishing and enforcing a vast network of 
marine reserves can we reverse the decline and guarantee our children’s 
right to inherit healthy seas,” added Rattenbury.

<p>After returning from the Southern Ocean the Esperanza will continue on 
its 14 month expedition across four of the five oceans, to highlight 
their wonders and the threats they face, all the while mapping and 
demonstrating the need for a global network of marine reserves (4).

<p>To help in the campaign Greenpeace is planning to gather a million 
“Ocean Defenders” through the course of the expedition – supporters who 
will join the call for action.

<p>The Esperanza, the newest of the Greenpeace ships, has been fitted with 
new hi-tech equipment for the voyage, including 24/7 internet that will 
enable the ship to interact with supporters, below the water line 
cameras, a Remote Operating Vehicle camera and web cams. The crew will 
be blogging, podcasting and vlogging (video blogging) from the ship and 
producing programmes for the newly created web-based Greenpeace TV.

<p>Notes to Editors:
<p>(1) Pew Institute for Ocean Science
<p>(2) Greenpeace is calling for 40% of the world’s oceans to be designated 
as marine reserves. A global network of marine reserves would cost $12 
billion dollars a year – the same as is spent annually on perfume in the 
US and Europe.
<p>(3) A loophole in the 1986 international moratorium on commercial 
whaling governed by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) allows 
“scientific” whaling. The IWC established the Southern Ocean Whale 
Sanctuary in 1994.
