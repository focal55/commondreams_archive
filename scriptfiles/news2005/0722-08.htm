<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON  - July 22  -  Following the aborted bombing in London yesterday the capital is in a high state of alert. Armed police are patrolling throughout the city. Today police shot dead a man they claim was linked to yesterday's events and police marksmen fired shots in Harrow Road.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We don't want the situation to develop where the city is so tense that the police are inclined to shoot first and ask questions afterwards. The police should release all information about this shooting in order to reassure the Muslim community in particular who may fear they are being targetted.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this weeks Guardian ICM poll 64% of people said that Tony Blair bore responsibility for the London bombings. The Chatham House report and the government's own Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre both linked the bombings directly with the Iraq war. Stop the War will continue our campaign to bring those repsponsible for that war to account and to bring the troops home. Those who have died in Iraq and in London deserve nothing less.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
