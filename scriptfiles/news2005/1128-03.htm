<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 - Families USA and the Health Assistance Partnership (HAP) released today a directory of state-specific and community-based resources to help Medicare beneficiaries find the prescription drug plan that best serves their needs.

<p>American families nationwide will follow their Thanksgiving feast with a helping of homework: studying the Medicare prescription drug plans available for their parents, their grandparents, or themselves. It's a big job, but the local resources identified by HAP and Families USA are available to help sort through the options.  Medicare drug plans vary by state and locality, making regional and local information sources particularly valuable to Medicare beneficiaries.

<p>Significant assistance is offered through State Health Insurance and Assistance Programs, or SHIPs. SHIPs exist in every state, the District of Columbia, and 3 territories (Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virginia Islands, and Guam) and offer objective and unbiased benefit information and assistance to Medicare recipients.  In approximately 1,100 SHIP offices across the country, more than 12,000 professional and volunteer staff are hard at work providing person-to-person counseling about the new Medicare drug coverage.  

<p>The centralized directory of these specialized resources is attached and can be found at <a href="http://www.familiesusa.org">http://www.familiesusa.org</a> and <a href="http://www.healthassistancepartnership.org">http://www.healthassistancepartnership.org</a><!-- #EndEditable -->
