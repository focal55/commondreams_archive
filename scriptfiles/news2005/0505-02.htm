<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 5 -- &quot;NOW activists across the country are leading an emergency campaign to save our courts,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy. &quot;We are targeting senators in fifteen states and sending the message that we will not allow the legacy of our courts to be dictated by religious and political extremists.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a critical time for NOW activists in 15 states represented by senators who have not yet said publicly whether or not they will support Senator Frist's attempt to &quot;go nuclear&quot; and banish the filibuster. NOW activists are targeting Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Delaware, Louisiana, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Dakota, urging undecided senators not to &quot;blow up&quot; the senate.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Republican leaders are misleading the public by claiming that Democrats have blocked numerous judicial nominations,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;The fact is that in the last four years, they've only blocked 10 of Bush's nominees while confirming over 200.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responding to the suggestion that filibusters against nominees Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown might trigger the nuclear option, Gandy said: &quot;NOW is not pleased to oppose the elevation of two women to the highest courts of the land. But our primary focus, above all else, is equality and justice for women. Unfortunately, these two nominees have embraced with zeal judicial philosophies that do not respect women's rights, consumer rights, environmental rights or minority rights.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite their gender, these two state Supreme Court Justices have revealed their hostility to the employment rights and reproductive health of women. Senate Democrats were right to filibuster these two nominees when they were first nominated, and should do so again. George W. Bush thumbed his nose at the justifiable opposition to these nominees, knowing that he was throwing down the gauntlet.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This battle over judicial nominees is ultimately about the Supreme Court,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;Whether or not we succeed in protecting the filibuster could determine the status of abortion, civil rights and the separation of church and state for decades to come.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
