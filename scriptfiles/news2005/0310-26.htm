<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- Navy Vice Admiral Albert T. Church is testifying today before Congress that while prisoner abuse and torture has occurred at the hands of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guant&aacute;namo Bay, the incidents are isolated and not part of a systemic policy of torture.  The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents over 500 detainees currently and formerly held at Guant&aacute;namo and which argued for the detainees in a landmark case before the Supreme Court, denounces the findings of this latest report. After hearing reports of torture, the Center for Constitutional Rights has long called for an independent investigation and prosecutor to examine allegations of abuse at U.S.-run prison camps, a request the Bush Administration has steadfastly avoided. The report by Vice Admiral Church is the latest in a series of findings from investigations conducted within the Department of Defense purporting to closely examine the Department&#146;s own misconduct. It is a far cry from an independent report by independent, unbiased investigators. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concrete evidence of a deliberate policy of abuse and torture is plentiful. There are leaked memos from Attorney General Alberto Gonzales when he was White House Counsel to then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee authorizing torture and abuse. There are written authorizations from Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to use dogs, sleep deprivation, hooding, stress positions and more, all outlawed under treaties the U.S. has signed, and we know that Generals Miller and Sanchez have authorized the use of dogs. None of these reports even try to explain away CIA torture and outsourcing torture or rendition.  To this day, Attorney General Gonzales continues to insist that the prohibition on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment does not apply to U.S.-held foreign nationals held outside the U.S.   All the slanted investigations in the world cannot cover this up. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because the Church report fails to consider individual responsibility for torture and abuse, there is no one to hold accountable for what are clearly violations of the United States Constitution and moral standing. The Church report appears to continue the cover-up of high level involvement in the abuses and torture that were carried out from Afghanistan to Iraq to Guant&aacute;namo. Until an independent commission or a special prosecutor with access to all information investigates the abuse and torture that hundreds of the D.O.D&#146;s own documents show has been routine, the American public will not have the full picture of the role of high-ranking U.S. officials, including Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, have played in this shameful debacle. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hundreds of documents obtained under a Freedom of Information Act suit filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights and partnering organizations show widespread torture and abuse in U.S.-run facilities around the world and indicate a pattern which cannot have been unknown to high ranking officials. The Center for Constitutional Rights has many cases pending against U.S. government officials for torture at Guant&aacute;namo and Abu Ghraib, for rendition to third countries for torture, and for conspiring with private government contractors to torture detainees. We will continue to advocate on behalf of justice until this Administration takes notice.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
