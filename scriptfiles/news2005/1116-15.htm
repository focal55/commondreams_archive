<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 16  - Speaking on Cannon Terrace today, members of the U.S. Congress and labor 
leaders sent a clear message to the Bush administration and the United 
States Trade Representative as they attempt to wrap up talks for a free 
trade agreement with Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia: Move away from a 
failed trade model or face another tough battle in Congress.

<p>Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said, with the Central American Trade Agreement 
[CAFTA] "our Congress made the wrong choice almost four months ago, and 
here we are again. AFTA is just as bad as NAFTA, just as bad as CAFTA 
for working families. These are failed policies that sell out American 
working families and ship American jobs overseas"

<p>Linda Sanchez (D-CA, also noted, "CAFTA was a bad idea for American 
working families, and our country cannot afford another trade deal that 
rewards countries which have poor labor standards. It is time to call on 
President Bush to stop making deals which favor his cronies and to start 
protecting the hard working men and women who make up the workforce 
around the world.

<p>The main concern expressed by members of Congress is the lack of 
enforceable worker rights protection in the current Andean Free Trade 
Agreement [AFTA] text. This was the same concern that led to near 
unanimous opposition from House Democrats in the vote on CAFTA in July.

<p>"President Bush and the USTR have not learned their lesson, and they 
crank out agreement after agreement using the same bad model designed to 
enrich the few at the expense of many" said John Murphy, vice-president 
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters

<p>Xaiver Becerra (D-CA) noted that AFTA did not have to go down this road: 
"Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo has said publicly that he would 
welcome the inclusion of internationally accepted core labor standards 
into the Andean Free Trade Agreement and I thank him for taking that 
important step. It is our hope that as we move forward with finalizing 
negotiations, all participating countries follow President Toledos lead 
to include the five International Labor Organization core standards 
within the four corners of the agreement."

<p>But unless the Bush administration changes course AFTA will not be able 
to garner support.

<p>"This trade deal is simply unacceptable; more trade unionists have been 
murdered in the past decade in Colombia than in the rest of the world 
combined, and this is the country we single out for a trade agreement. 
This is a reward for violence and a climate of terror for working 
people. The current trade model simply does not work: poverty and income 
inequality are on the rise especially in countries with whom we have 
agreements, and there is a rising trade deficit and a decline of wages 
and employment in the U.S.," concluded Thea Lee, policy director for the 
AFL-CIO.
