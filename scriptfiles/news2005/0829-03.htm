<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> POZO DEL TUME, SALTA, ARGENTINA - Greenpeace today 
stopped two bulldozers from clearing the forest to expand the GE Soya 
frontier further into what is left of the Great American Chaco Forest. 
Four activists on motorbikes have blocked these machines, and another 
four on two helicopters (painted as jaguars) has filmed the devastation 
of the forests from the air.

<p>Bulldozers are currently clearing the forests of South America at an 
alarming rate. In Argentina areas of forest the size of a soccer pitch 
disappear every three minutes. The rate of disappearance rises to every 
ten seconds in countries like Paraguay and Brazil, as latest Government 
figures for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon show.

<p>"Companies are failing to act responsibly, and the Argentinean 
Government stands by while rampant deforestation continues," said 
Emiliano Ezcurra, Greenpeace Argentina forests campaigner. "We're here 
to place ourselves between bulldozers and trees to stop the destruction 
of these last remaining ancient forests".

<p>The social consequences are just as devastating; small farmers and 
indigenous communities are forcibly evicted from their land by 
government-supported GE Soya landlords. All the trees knocked down by 
bulldozers are discarded onto huge piles, often kilometres long, and set 
alight. The cleared land can only support the GE soya monoculture for a 
few years before the soil nutrients disappear. The options then are to 
use more chemicals or just leave the land to become a desert and move on 
to clear more forest. This process contributes to climate change, 
biodiversity loss and human rights violations at the same time.

<p>The Greenpeace helicopter was surveying the area when the bulldozers 
were seen in the province of Salta, 1800 kilometres, north of Buenos 
Aires. On the ground the Greenpeace 'Jaguars' managed to get to the area 
in time to confront the bulldozers and stop them.

<p>"It is outrageous that such devastation continues to take place at such 
a fast rate only because companies want to feed pigs in Europe or 
chickens in China. Unless something gets done immediately the world will 
see the large forest areas in South America disappear in a very short 
period of time. The international community should call on the 
Argentinean Government now to stop this disaster," said Rex Weyler, 
early Greenpeace activist, from Vancouver, Canada, who took part in the 
action.

<p>Solutions do exist already for these large forest areas to be managed 
sustainably through good forest practices like Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC) certification, meaning that jobs and wealth are not 
incompatible with keeping forest diversity, clean air and water.

<p>The Greenpeace 'Jaguars' will continue to stop the bulldozers with their 
motorbikes and helicopters over the days to come.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
