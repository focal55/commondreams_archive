<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 3 - Today's defeat of the Grassley-Dorgan payment limit amendment in the U.S. Senate was a shameful sellout to agribusiness by both Democrats and Republicans.

<p>What senators who voted against Grassley-Dorgan are saying is simple: "Government farm payments of $250,000 per couple year after year, with no test of need and no requirement to repay, is just not enough. Our biggest, most subsidy-dependent farm operations deserve nothing less than unlimited taxpayer handouts."

<p>It is a sellout of not only taxpayers, but of more than 95 percent of the farmers in this country.

<p>The amendment would have eliminated a payment cut for the vast majority of farms by shifting the burden to the country's biggest subsidized farming operations — the ones that collect hundreds of thousands of dollars, and sometimes millions — every year, as Environmental Working Group's (EWG) Farm Subsidy Database makes clear.

<p>The amendment would have invested the savings in conservation programs that are a much better deal for most farmers and taxpayers.

<p>The commodity lobby claims that farm bill "contracts with taxpayers" should be left untouched when that stance serves to block reform. But Big Ag hypocritically tears up those "sacred" contracts whenever they need more handouts from taxpayers.

<p>The farm interests who argued this week that no changes in subsidy policy should be made between farm bills, in this case until 2007, are the very same interests who lobbied through five massive increases in subsidy handouts, most of which went to the biggest operations, between farm bills from 1996 through 2002.

<p>This vote will only deepen the cynicism of the poorest nations in the world in the run up to WTO meetings next month in Hong Kong. They will be right to see in the Senate's affirmation of the status quo a disturbing unwillingness on the part of the United States to reform our bloated, wasteful farm subsidy programs in order to advance fair trade and promote economic growth in the developing world. The only sensible course of action for other countries is to do what Brazil did — pursue WTO litigation against our subsidy programs to gain whatever negotiating leverage they can.
