<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 3 -- Today, Moving Ideas released &quot;State of the Union 2005: Reality Check,&quot; (<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/2005_sou.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/2005_sou.htm</a>) a report outlining aspects of Bush's speech that were out of touch with reality. Bush claimed victory in many areas, but the facts tell something different about the true effect of Bush's policies. &quot;Reality Check&quot; focuses on Social Security, the Iraqi elections, legal reform, the budget, education, and job training.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration remains out of touch with the needs and realities of Americans by pushing an aggressive agenda that would slash Social Security benefits, dismantle the Medicaid trust fund, provide tax cuts for the wealthiest 1%, reform class action and medical malpractice suits to restrict access to justice, and completely re-write the tax code,&quot; laments Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush gave special attention to his plans to end Social Security as we know it.  He tried to scare the American people by falsely claiming that the system is in crisis and will go bankrupt in 2042.  What happens in 2042 is the trust fund put aside for baby boomers will run out, but 80% of costs will still be covered.  The system only needs small adjustments to make up the difference.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, the administration plan calls for severe cuts to benefits forcing workers to try and make up the difference through risky private accounts, but, contrary to what the President claimed last night, experts estimate that workers will only be able to recoup part of what they will lose in benefits.  Instead of saving Social Security, privatization would require borrowing more than $2 trillion from foreign countries over the next 10 years, $6 trillion over the next 20, and $15 trillion over the next 40 years.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a high price to pay, especially for turning a guaranteed benefit into a questionable gamble,&quot; says Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;State of the Union 2005: Reality Check&quot; is available at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/109_cong.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/109_cong.htm</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located in Moving Ideas' Progressive Policy Experts Database at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the leading source for easily searched and sorted progressive policy information, Moving Ideas provides the background information for citizen activism via the Internet.
