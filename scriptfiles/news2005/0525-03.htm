<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 25 -- With 
  the nuclear industry running an aggressive public relations campaign to promote 
  itself as the solution to global warming, a report released today by the U.S. 
  Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) demonstrates that the goals of the McCain-Lieberman 
  Climate Stewardship Act can be met while slashing America's reliance on nuclear 
  energy in half. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nuclear power is not 
  a solution to global warming. We can meet our energy needs, tackle global warming, 
  and save consumers billions of dollars by taking advantage of America's vast 
  supplies of renewable energy and energy efficiency,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Legislative 
  Director Anna Aurilio.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, &quot;<a href="http://www.pirg.org/alerts/route.asp?id2=17334">A<u> 
  Responsible Electricity Future: An Efficient, Cleaner and Balanced Scenario 
  for the U.S. Electricity System</u></a>,&quot; conducted for PIRG by Synapse 
  Energy Economics, shows the potential for a clean and secure energy future that 
  relies on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources such as wind, biomass, 
  and solar instead of polluting fossil fuels and nuclear power. Under this &quot;balanced 
  case,&quot; the U.S. could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the electricity 
  sector by 16 percent by 2010 compared to business-as-usual, while holding nuclear 
  power generation steady and saving $3 billion annually.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shifting investments to 
  energy efficiency and renewable energy would pay off even more in the long run, 
  according to the report. By 2025, the U.S. would reduce its CO2 emissions from 
  power plants by 47 percent, reduce nuclear power generation by nearly half, 
  and save $36 billion annually compared to business-as-usual.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Climate Stewardship 
  Act would reduce CO2 emissions from the electricity sector by 12 percent in 
  2010 compared to business-as-usual, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
  The bill does not require deeper cuts after 2010.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nuclear power is the 
  most dangerous and expensive of all energy sources. We shouldn't give even more 
  hard-earned taxpayer dollars to the nuclear industry,&quot; said Aurilio. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aurilio noted that none 
  of the nuclear power industry's financial, security, safety, waste, or proliferation 
  problems has been solved. For instance: <br>
  </font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The nuclear industry has received at least $70 billion in direct federal subsidies 
  in the last 50 years and still cannot finance a new plant on its own. <br>
  <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  While the 9/11 Commission concluded that al Qaeda considered attacking nuclear 
  plants, nuclear reactors and irradiated fuel pools still remain vulnerable to 
  a terrorist attack.<br>
  <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   Nuclear waste remains a serious problem without a safe solution.<br></font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no need to 
  jeopardize our health, safety, and economy with increased nuclear power when 
  we have cleaner, cheaper solutions to reduce global warming pollution,&quot; 
  concluded Aurilio.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.uspirg.org"><u><i>U.S.
