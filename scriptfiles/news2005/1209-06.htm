<p>Bread for the World advocates will be working to keep development and poverty reduction at the center of the Doha Development Round of trade talks in Hong Kong next week. Making global agriculture rules fairer and creating a more level playing field for rich and poor nations alike should be the focus of any agreement to emerge from this meeting.

<p>With the vast majority of the world's poorest people depending on agriculture for their livelihood, agriculture must be central to any agreement. Major impediments to poor nations are the trade distorting agricultural subsidies that the United States and other wealthy nations currently use. Finding a path to eliminating such roadblocks and opening industrial countries' markets is vital to strengthening economies around the world.

<p>However, any agreement reached in Hong Kong will need congressional approval and policy changes to implement the agreement. Bread for the World will urge the U.S. Congress to approve changes in trade policies that will help improve the lives and livelihoods of poor farmers in developing countries.

<p>"Ultimately, the test of success or failure for the Doha Development Round is how it affects poor people," said Rev. David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World. "Trade has the potential to be used as a powerful tool for reducing poverty. A successful Doha agreement would provide developing countries both the opportunity and the assistance they need to use trade to lift themselves out of poverty."

<p>Bread for the World supports a package of four goals for the Doha round:

	<p>*	elimination of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies;<br>

	*	expanded market access for poor-country products;<br>

	*	freedom for poor countries to determine how they liberalize their economies; and,<br>

	*	increased assistance to help poor countries develop their capacity to participate in trade.<br>
