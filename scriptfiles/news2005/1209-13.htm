<p>WASHINGTON - December 9 - The Black Eyed Peas,  Avril Lavigne, and The Cure are joining Amnesty International in  a groundbreaking musical venture using the works of John Lennon.  Make Some Noise, launching on December 10 - International Human  Rights Day - aims to inspire a new generation to celebrate and  stand up for human rights.</p>
<p>   The global launch of Make Some Noise will see the release of  the Black Eyed Peas' rousing version of Power to the People, The  Cure's interpretation of Love, Snow Patrol's recording of  Isolation, and Grow Old With Me performed by The Postal Service.  All four exclusive singles will be available as online downloads  at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=57890&Link=http://www.amnesty.org/noise">http://www.amnesty.org/noise</a> via MSN Music.</p>
<p>   These will be followed in early 2006 by an array of iconic  John Lennon tracks from further top artists, including Avril  Lavigne.</p>
<p>   Amnesty International wants Make Some Noise to encourage a new  audience to celebrate and take action for human rights and  attract one million new supporters worldwide.</p>
<p>   "John Lennon's message of hope lives on in his art, which  continues to resonate today," said AIUSA Executive Director Dr.  William F. Schulz. "Amnesty International looks forward to  inspiring young people to work toward the shared vision of a more  peaceful and just world through Make Some Noise."</p>
<p>   All of the contemporary recordings will feature as either  single downloads, over the course of the year, or as part of a  download compilation album. Due for release in 2006, the  compilation will mark one of the greatest music projects of the  decade. In the United States, Microsoft's MSN Music will serve as  the exclusive provider of music downloads for Make Some Noise.</p>
<p>   All profits from music sales will be used to support Amnesty  International - the world's largest human rights organization -  in its global human rights work.</p>
<p>   Make Some Noise follows Yoko Ono's generous donation of the  rights to John Lennon's solo songbook to Amnesty International in  2003.</p>
<p>   "It's wonderful that, through this campaign, music which is so  familiar to many people of my era will now be embraced by a whole  new generation," says Yoko Ono. "John's music set out to inspire  change, just as Make Some Noise does. In standing up for human  rights, we really can make the world a better place."</p>
<p>   Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas, says "Power to the People is  the ultimate anthem! We had an incredible time recording the  track for Make Some Noise, and hope the single will motivate  people to truly stand up and be counted."</p>
<p>   Irene Khan, Secretary General at Amnesty International, says  "We're thrilled to be using John Lennon's songs in our human  rights work. We hope this music will bring an awareness of human  rights to a new generation. After all, human rights are what make  music possible - we wouldn't be able to create music, listen to  it or dance to it without freedom of speech, expression, and  association."</p>
