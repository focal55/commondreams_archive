<p>Why: <br>
<p> Houston October 12 — A compelling television ad campaign featuring Houston gay and lesbian couples talking about the importance of marriage is slated to air in Houston starting midweek October 12. This is the first-ever TV ad campaign to bring the personal voices of same-sex couples to the public, discussing what marriage equality means to them. The campaign, sponsored by the Vote Against the Amendment Committee, a project of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, includes seven commercials in opposition to Proposition 2, the proposed state constitutional ban on legal recognition of same-sex relationships in Texas. 

<p>In a series of seven ads, to be aired on CBS, NBC and Fox Affliates in the Houston area, Gay couples and their extended families tell their stories to the voting public shedding light on the realities of the impact of not having the equal right to marriage. Couples who appear in the commericals will speak at the press conference and will be available to reporters for a Q&A session. 

<p>According to the U.S. census, 42,912 same-sex couples live in the Texas. The greater Houston metro area alone ranks 44th out of the 331 metropolitan areas defined by the census nationwide. To date, 19 states have pased prohibitive laws or state consitutional amendments prohibitng same-sex marriage. 

<p>The Task Force launched the Vote Against the Amendment Committee in August 2005 to help defeat Proposition 2. The committee and the Task Force are working in partnership with a coalition of state and local groups in Texas that are part of the No Nonsense in November campaign. The ads may be viewed at <a href="www.thetaskforce.org/media/epress.cfm">www.thetaskforce.org/media/epress.cfm</a>.
