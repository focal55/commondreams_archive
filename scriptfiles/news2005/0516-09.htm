<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 16 -- After the American Diabetes Association received a large gift from major manufacturer of sugar-sweetened beverages, its top medical official is claiming that sugar has nothing to do with diabetes.  In an interview published in today&#146;s Corporate Crime Reporter, Richard Kahn, the chief scientific and medical officer with the American Diabetes Association said &#147;What is the evidence that sugar itself has anything to do with diabetes? There is no evidence,&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 21, the ADA announced a &#147;three-year, multi-million dollar alliance&#148; with Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, which produces sweetened soft drinks that are implicated in the epidemic of obesity and diabetes in the United States.  Its parent company is Cadbury Schweppes, which is the third largest soft-drink manufacturer in the world, after Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Saying that sugar has nothing to do with diabetes is like saying that tobacco has nothing to do with emphysema,&#148; said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert. &#147;The American Diabetes Association has been so corrupted that they have sunk to the mentality of &#145;tobacco scientists&#146; who denied the link between tobacco and lung cancer.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Incredibly, when Kahn was asked whether sugary drinks have anything to do with diabetes, he responded &#147;No one has a clue of whether they do or don&#146;t.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is ample evidence linking diets high in sugar, and sugary drinks, with obesity.  For example, a study in the Lancet, titled &quot;Relation Between Consumption of Sugar-Sweetened Drinks and Childhood Obesity: a Prospective, Observational Analysis&quot; found that the likelihood of obesity in children &#147;increased 1.6 times for each additional can of sugar-sweetened drink that they consumed every day.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Today&#146;s Corporate Crime Reporter interview is posted at: <a href="http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/diabetes051605.htm" target="_new">http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/diabetes051605.htm</a></i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More information about the American Diabetes Association-Cadbury Schweppes &#147;alliance&#148; is available at: <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050421/dcth002.html?.v=7" target="_new">http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050421/dcth002.html?.v=7</a></font></i></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commercial Alert is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to keep the commercial culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental integrity and democracy.
