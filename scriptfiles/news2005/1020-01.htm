<p>MADRID - At 10.00am this morning, forty one 
Greenpeace activists sealed the entrance to Madrid's prestigious Queen 
Sofia Museum (Reina Sofia), and declared it an ancient forest crime 
scene. The activists hung a banner in front of the museum reading 
'Forest Crime in the Reina Sofia' and drew the outline of a tree's 
'body' on the ground.

 

<p>Today's action followed the discovery that the museum's newly opened 
extension has been built using timber bought from companies involved in 
the illegal logging of the Amazon rainforest (1).

 

<p>Greenpeace International forest campaigner, Belinda Fletcher, said: 
"Illegal logging is out of control in the Amazon. It's a disgrace that 
the Spanish Government is spending public money on fuelling this corrupt 
trade in stolen rainforest timber."

 

<p>The Queen Sofia Museum is one of the best known in Spain and houses 
Picasso's Guernica. Designed by the architect Jean Nouvel, it has been 
extended over the last three years by the Spanish construction company 
Dragados/ACS. The timber species (jatoba) used in the library, 
exhibition rooms, auditorium and offices comes from Pará State, the most 
extensively logged region of the Amazon. (2)

 

<p>Life on Earth depends on ancient forests. They are the richest, most 
diverse habitats and help stabilize climate. They are also home to 
millions of indigenous and forest dwelling people. Seventeen per cent of 
the Amazon has been completely wiped out over the past 30 years (3), and 
even more has been damaged by destructive logging. Today, it is 
estimated that between 60 to 80 per cent of logging in the Brazilian 
Amazon is illegal.

 

<p>"It's absurd that it's illegal to import stolen works of art into the 
EU, but it's not illegal to import stolen wood to build a museum like 
this.  If the EU does not act to stop the illegal timber trade, the 
world's ancient forests and the life they support will disappear 
forever," said Fletcher.

 

<p>Greenpeace is calling on European governments to outlaw all imports of 
illegal timber and to promote environmentally and socially responsible 
forest management worldwide. (4)

 

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization, which uses 
non-violent, creative communication tools to put the spotlight on global 
environmental problems, and to drive towards solutions essential for a 
green and peaceful future.

 



 

<p>Notes to Editors:

 

<p> (1) Documents provided to Greenpeace by the museum show that the timber 
was imported by the Spanish company 'Maderas Besteiro'. This company 
purchased the timber from three Brazilian companies; Madeireira São 
Marcos; Serraria Sao Jose; and Serraria Santa Clara. All these companies 
have been involved in illegal logging in Pará State and have been fined 
by IBAMA, the federal agency responsible for environmental issues and 
forest conservation in Brazil.

 

<p>(2) Today Greenpeace has released a report of its findings at the museum 
in Spanish at www.greenpeace.es and an English summary is available at 
<a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/queensofiamuseum">http://www.greenpeace.org/queensofiamuseum</a><p>(3) INPE in www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/index.html

 

<p>(4) Illegal logging and related trade is scheduled for discussion at the 
Agriculture Council of the EU next week, 24-25th October 2005.
