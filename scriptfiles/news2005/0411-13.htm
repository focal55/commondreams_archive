<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 11 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">News Advisory:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York State Assembly Codes Committee will vote Tuesday, April 12, in Albany on a measure to reauthorize the state's death penalty, which was declared unconstitutional last June. If the committee votes against the death penalty, it will make New York the first state to dismantle the death penalty since the United States reinstated capital punishment in the mid-1970s. New York's Court of Appeals decision left life without parole as the maximum sentence for those convicted of the most heinous crimes. Public opinion polls in New York show a large majority, almost two to one, supporting life without parole as preferred over the death penalty as the maximum sentence and a large plurality opposing reinstatement.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New York's move away from the death penalty is one more landmark in a national trend. This year legislation has progressed in New Mexico and Connecticut, the Supreme Court has banned juvenile executions, and New Jersey and Illinois remain under moratoriums. New York's progress demonstrates how the political landscape has changed with regard to the death penalty. New York was the most recent state to reinstate the death penalty in 1995 and is poised to become the first to decide that its experiment with death has failed.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shari Silberstein, co-director of the Quixote Center and a leading expert in the national movement to halt executions, will be available in person or by cell phone for comment after the vote. In person, she will be joined by David Kaczynski, the Unabomber's brother and head of New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty, families of murder victims, and others. The committee is scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, April 12.
