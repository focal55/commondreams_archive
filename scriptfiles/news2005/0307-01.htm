<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAPLAND, FINDLAND -- March 7 -- Today in a joint operation with S&aacute;mi reindeer herders, Greenpeace campaigners started demarcating the boundaries of the last remaining reindeer forests of Arctic Lapland. This unprecedented activity by reindeer herders follows many years of 'talk and log' processes by the Finnish government and continued logging operations in the S&aacute;mi homeland. (1)</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demarcation signs in Finnish, S&aacute;mi and English languages were strapped to trees at the edge of threatened forests, critical for the protection of winter reindeer grazing areas and the tradition of Sami reindeer herding. The signs read 'Reindeer Forest - No logging. Reindeer Herding Act.'(2)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Before, we used to have negotiations, but it had no significance. The logging went on anyway,&quot; said Kalevi Paadar, a S&aacute;mi reindeer herder from the Nellim herd group. &quot;Once the decision is made on how much forest is to be felled, it is carried out-no matter how much we try to resist. ... Now they don't even notify us before they start logging. There seems to be no more room for negotiation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A coalition of reindeer herding co-operatives from Inari are demanding that the government agree to a logging moratorium in important reindeer forest areas mapped by the herders while formal negotiations take place. (3) S&aacute;mi reindeer herding co-operatives have never been given the opportunity to participate in meaningful negotiations with the government about which forest areas are scheduled for logging.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of the vital grazing forest marked on the co-operatives' maps are slated for logging by Mets&auml;hallitus, the government's own logging company. Logging has continued in five out of six co-operatives that have published such maps. However, according to the Finnish Broadcasting Company, Mets&auml;hallitus has today announced that it will temporarily halt logging operations in the reindeer herders' area of the Nellim group.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today announcement by Mets&auml;hallitus to stop logging in Nellim comes after years and years of disrespect for S&aacute;mi reindeer herders' rights,&quot; said Phil Aikman, Greenpeace forest campaigner. &quot;What remains to be seen is whether there is the political will to resolve this conflict, in all the reindeer herding co-operatives, once and for all&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 2 March, Greenpeace established a Forest Rescue Station in one of the threatened reindeer forest areas to highlight the ongoing destruction by Mets&auml;hallitus, the Finnish government's logging company and those paper companies that continue to buy this destruction.<br>		<br> In a joint operation with S&aacute;mi reindeer herders, Greenpeace campaigners start demarcating the boundaries of the last remaining reindeer forests of Arctic Lapland.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a joint operation with S&aacute;mi reindeer herders, Greenpeace campaigners start demarcating the boundaries of the last remaining reindeer forests of Arctic Lapland.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Notes to Editor: </i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) This view is reflected in recent recommendations by the UN Committee on Human Rights which issue a statement in November 2004:<br>&quot;....regrets that it has not received a clear answer concerning the rights of the S&aacute;mi as an indigenous people (Constitution, sect. 17, subsect. 3), in the light of article 1 of the Covenant. It reiterates its concern over the failure to settle the question of S&aacute;mi rights to land ownership and the various public and private uses of land that affect the S&aacute;mi 's traditional means of subsistence - in particular reindeer breeding - thus endangering their traditional culture and way of life, and hence their identity.&quot;<br>&quot;The State party should, in conjunction with the S&aacute;mi people, swiftly take decisive action to arrive at an appropriate solution to the land dispute with due regard for the need to preserve the S&aacute;mi identity in accordance with article 27 of the Covenant. Meanwhile it is requested to refrain from any action that might adversely prejudice settlement of the issue of S&aacute;mi land rights. &quot;</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) In Lapland, the State claims ownership of up to 90% of the S&aacute;mi traditional homeland, covering nearly 39,000 km2 of Finland. The Reindeer Herding Act (Section 2) proclaims that these defined areas &quot;shall not be used in a manner that causes considerable damage to the reindeer herding.&quot;</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) On 16 January 2005, a coalition of Inari reindeer co-operatives sent a letter to the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry detailing preconditions for negotiations under the Mets&auml;hallitus Natural Resource Plan (NRP). A copy of the letter is available in English.</font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
