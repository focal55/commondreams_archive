<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSTERDAM -- April 4 -- A worldwide ban on single hulled oil tankers that enters into force tomorrow (1) threatens to dump thousands of toxic ships on Asian and Turkish beaches. Workers in India, China and Turkey break up European vessels in appalling conditions with no protection from explosions, asbestos and a cocktail of toxic chemicals contained in the ships. While the phase-out of single hulled tankers has been welcomed by the international environmental organisation, Greenpeace is warning that the EU has failed to ensure the phase-out also includes environmentally and socially responsible procedures for breaking the vessels.</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EU and the International Maritime Organisation moved to phase out single-hull oil tankers in the wake of the Erika and the Prestige disasters. According to a Greenpeace analysis, (2) over 2,000 such tankers will be removed from the water and scrapped within five years. More than thousand tankers are expected to be scrapped in 2005, a figure that dwarfs previous estimates. According to the analysis, some 334 tankers are either owned by European companies or registered - &quot;flagged&quot; - in Europe.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">?The European Union successfully achieved the global accelerated phasing out of single hull oil tankers but did not provide measures for ensuring the safe and clean breaking of these ships. The EU now needs to ensure proper follow up, so that the problem is not simply exported to vulnerable workers in developing world shipbreaking yards? ? said Marietta Harjono, campaigner of Greenpeace. (3)</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the United Nations Basel Convention, vessels due to be broken are considered toxic waste and should not be exported from OECD countries to non-OECD countries. Greenpeace urges EU institutions to take urgent action on EU controlled single-hull oil tankers, by enforcing the EU Waste Shipment Regulation and to fight the lack of transparency in shipping and to develop a definitive and consolidated list of single-hull oil tankers subject to phase-out regulations. The organisation also demands an immediate commitment from EU transport ministers and the European Commission that the toxic burden of Europe's single-hull oil tankers will not end up on Asian beaches.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace is currently carrying out a shipbreaking ?toxic patrol? on the Mediterranean Sea.<br>		<br>Notes to Editor:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) On the 5th of April the by the global phase out legislation (MARPOL I 13G) enters into force.<br>(2) The report 'Destination Unknown: European single hull oil tankers...
