GUANTANAMO -<i> “Our march says that the work of Christian Peacemaker Team in Iraq is like the work that we're doing here as we march to Guantánamo. We're all looking for just and humane treatment for all the detainees whether in Guantánamo, Iraq or other hidden detention camps we can't reach.”</i> -Sr. Anne Montgomery, Marcher and member of Christian Peacemaker Teams in Iraq
<p><i>“The only thing standing between us and the Guantánamo prisoners is George Bush's permission.”</i>         
-Gary Ashbeck with the Witness Against Torture
 

<p><b>The World Says No to Torture: 
Solidarity Vigils Today, International Human Rights Day


</b>
<p>Today, International Human Rights Day, a group of 25 US Christians intent on arriving to the US Naval Base at Guantánamo to visit the prisoners are on the doorstep of the base. After three days of marching under the hot Caribbean sun, the US Christian group is less than twenty miles from the base. 

<p>Witness Against Torture includes two members of Christian Peacemaker Teams, Sr. Anne Montgomery and Danny Burns, and marches with the somber knowledge that four Christian Peacemakers are facing the threat of execution in Iraq. Also marching are Fr. Steve Kelly, S.J., and Frida Berrigan, daughter of renowned US peace activist Phil Berrigan.

<p>“There is a misconception that George Bush represents the interests of Christians,” said Witness Against Torture spokesperson Mike McGuire.  “The truth is many Christians are appalled by the policies of this administration.  There are Christians around the world standing for human rights and against injustice, putting their bodies in the way.”

<p>In June of this year, President Bush said to those concerned with the conditions in Guantánamo, “You're welcome to go down yourself... and take a look at the conditions.”  Now a group of US Christians is calling his bluff. 

<p>After days of meetings with the Cuban authorities the US Christians now know that with US permission to visit the base, the Cubans will escort them through the Cuban militarized zone to the entrance.  They now await President Bush's word.  They are asking people to call on President Bush to grant permission for them to visit the prisoners.

<p>US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s tour in Europe this week has focused world attention on the story of US torture and abuse.  The story deepened on Thursday with reports (San Francisco Chronicle) of a revealed US Defense Department memo that proves an explicit policy of rendition for torture.  

<p>Rice’s visit drew protests across Europe.  Today people across the United States are holding vigils to call for an end to torture, illegal and indefinite detentions, and the policy of “rendition.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
