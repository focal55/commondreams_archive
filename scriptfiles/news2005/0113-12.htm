<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 13 -- Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) applauds ABC's Nightline for Jan. 12's piece on Michael Shackelford, a gay teenager in rural Oklahoma. Nightline's thoughtful coverage of the isolation of being young and gay, the viciousness of religious bigotry and the care of a small community represents the kind of multi-faceted, complex coverage of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) issues so deficient in the mainstream media.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Michael's story of isolation and condemnation in his own faith family is not unique,&quot; said Ron Schlittler, acting executive director of PFLAG. &quot;There are many thousands of young people in conservative churches every Sunday who struggle with their same-sex attractions and they are terrified as they grow to recognize that they are different.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On one hand,&quot; Schlittler continues, &quot;they are taught values like honesty and personal integrity, and then they are told they must deny who they are if they hope to be welcomed and loved. Many suffer in silence as the subjects of condemnation from the pulpit, and many others face open hostility and rejection from congregations that have always been like family. We are encouraged by the journey taken by Michael's faith family, and hope they continue to re-think what it means to have valued members who are not heterosexual.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ABC News and Nightline have scratched the surface with their report last night. We at PFLAG hope the news team at ABC continues to hold up a mirror for America to examine these issues with an eye to the deeper human complexities involved -- and not only in the late-night time slot.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) is the nation's foremost family-based organization committed to the civil rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender persons. Founded in 1973 by mothers and fathers, PFLAG has 250,000 members and supporters in over 500 chapters throughout the United States.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
