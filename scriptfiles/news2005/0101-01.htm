<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW ORLEANS -- January 1, 2005 -- On January 20, 2005, when George W. Bush is taking the oath of office to begin his second term as president, a &#147;Jazz Funeral for Democracy&#148; will parade through the streets of downtown New Orleans lead by the world famous Treme Brass Band to mourn the occasion.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An ad hoc group of concerned individuals calling itself the January 20th Coalition of New Orleans (&quot;J20C&quot;) has held several meetings over the past month, planning strategies and mapping out a route the march&#146;s participants hope to follow at the same hour Bush is being sworn in in Washington, D.C.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Buddy Spell, one of the archetects of the action, &#147;While the rest of the country will be focused on the beginning of Bush&#146;s second term, our objective is to show the world that we are not in support of a continued war in Iraq, the torture and inhumane treatment of percieved enemies, record inflation, flagrant disregard for the constitutional rights of all citizens, state sponsored homophobia, government deception, and four more years of rule by a small group of wealthy, elite, corporate hacks. This will be a time to remind the president that he has a sworn obligation to represent and respect the rights and wishes of ALL Americans, including the 56 million people who voted against him.&#148;<br> <br>&quot;We think it note worthy that the action will take place right in the very heart of Red State Nation,&quot; Spell said.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The highlight of the march will be the symbolic casting of a copy of the Patriot Act into the Mississippi River at Woldenberg Park. Pending approval of their parade permit, the participants are tentatively scheduled to gather at Louis Armstrong Park at 10 a.m., begin marching down North Rampart Street to Canal Street through the heart of the Central Business District between 11 a.m. and noon, then continue along Canal to North Peters Street. From there they will enter Woldenberg Park at the Moon Walk, where a copy of the Patriot Act will be tossed into the river in protest. The march will then proceed up Decatur and North Peters to Esplanade Avenue and Frenchmen Street where mock inaugural balls will be staged at various neighborhood clubs. <br> <br>The march is expected to draw widespread support, as word of its plans continues to spread. The group has already drawn support and encouragement from peace and social justice organizations from all around the country. Many individual participants are expected to arrive from other cities for the event. Efforts are underway to bring in well-known speakers and anti-war leaders. Thus far, Kathy Kelly, Howard Zinn, and Dennis Kyne have agreed to address the rally.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tentative plans call for a horse-drawn hearse to pull a mock coffin carrying copies of the Patriot Act and the U.S. Constitution through the streets. Several brass marching bands, in addition to Treme,  have signed on to participate, along with many other individual musicians. Marchers will be wearing traditional mourning clothes and black armbands, symbolizing the tragedy of the Iraqi war effort. The march is hopeful of picking up support from workers in the CBD during their lunch hour, as well as other sympathizers along the route.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The support we are getting from all over the country has just been tremendous,&#148; Spell said. &#147;Word has gotten out over a number of websites and other, more mainstream  media, but mainly through word of mouth. And though demonstrations are being planned in Washington and other cities, this action will be as unique as is our heritage. We are staging this peaceful event for one simple reason . . . because we still can.&quot; <br> <br> &quot;We welcome the support and participation of anyone who wants to join us.&#148;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
