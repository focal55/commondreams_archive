<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">W. Mark Felt, the assistant director of the FBI during the Watergate 
scandal, has admitted to being "Deep Throat." He was the source of 
important information for Washington Post investigative reporters 
Woodward and Bernstein. Felt's revelations and tips kept the 
investigation alive by pulling back the shroud of secrecy hiding the 
criminal activities of the Nixon White House.

<p>Felt should receive the American Medal of Freedom for his courage and 
patriotism in defense of our democracy. The greatest threat to 
democracy is secrecy. It is a generic flaw of our representative system 
of government. Secrecy is endemic to government; it is the device 
government officialdom uses to hide the truth and to manipulate the 
media and the public, and is the slippery slope leading to tyranny.

<p>The only antidote to the excesses of secrecy is the occasional patriot 
leaking the truth to the media or to the Congress. Unfortunately, the 
Congress is all too complicit in maintaining secrecy in government. 
Thank you, Marc Felt, for your service to freedom and democracy; let us 
hope that your revelation is an incentive to present-day 
whistleblowers. The need for whistleblowers has never been greater.
