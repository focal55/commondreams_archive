<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 28 --</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nancy Keenan, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, blasted House passage of the &quot;Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act&quot; --a far-reaching and intrusive bill that would impose a complex patchwork of parental involvement laws on women and doctors around the country that even its supporters cannot explain.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that loving parents should be involved when their daughter faces a crisis pregnancy. Unfortunately, some young women cannot involve their parents because they come from homes where physical and emotional abuse is prevalent or their pregnancies are the result of incest,&quot; Keenan said. &quot;In these traumatic cases, young women need confidential access to a doctor. CIANA is a government-run-amok legislative jumble that does nothing to either prevent unintended pregnancies or strengthen troubled families. It is a complex set of inflexible bureaucratic mandates on families that are already under stress.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keenan said CIANA was far more intrusive than previous versions of this legislation. CIANA includes new multiple and confusing reporting mandates on doctors and a provision that would prosecute responsible adults&#151;such as grandparents or ministers--who help young women whose circumstances prevent them from confiding in their parents.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;CIANA would prohibit anyone other than a parent, including a grandparent, aunt, adult sibling, or minister from accompanying a young woman across state lines for an abortion if the home state&#146;s parental-involvement law has not been met,&quot; Keenan said. &quot;This means a grandmother could be prosecuted for accompanying her granddaughter to a doctor in another state &#151;even if that doctor is closest to the young woman&#146;s home and they were not attempting to evade a parental involvement law.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, and the American Public Health Association all have longstanding policies opposing mandatory parental-involvement laws because of the dangers they pose to young women and the need for confidential access to physicians.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
