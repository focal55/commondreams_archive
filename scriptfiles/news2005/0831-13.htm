<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 31 - ACORN, the nationwide community group, called today's announcement by Wells Fargo an important step in addressing the company's predatory lending problem, but said that Wells Fargo must still make amends for the practices which it now admits were wrong. "ACORN members around the country who have been fighting Wells Fargo's predatory lending practices are glad that the company has finally acknowledged the damage that their practices have been causing and have agreed to change them," said Maude Hurd, ACORN's National president. "However, Wells still needs to compensate the families and communities its predatory lending has hurt. In addition, these business practice changes must be made permanent and enforceable by Court order. Otherwise, Wells could revert to its old ways of doing business."

<p>In 2003, ACORN launched a national campaign to shed light on Wells Fargo's abusive lending, to force them to change their predatory practices, and to win some compensation for the borrowers they had harmed. 

<p>The campaign has included a steady and escalating series of actions, from demonstrations at local Wells Fargo offices throughout the country to a 2,000 person march to Wells Fargo's downtown Los Angeles office last summer. At Wells Fargo's shareholder meeting in April 2005, 15 members were able to go inside the meeting and directly confront CEO Richard Kovacevich about Wells Fargo's abusive loans. 

<p>As part of the campaign ACORN has also filed three lawsuits against Wells Fargo charging the company with unfair and deceptive lending practices, such as using "bait-and-switch" sales tactics. In addition, ACORN has submitted complaints to several state and regulatory agencies asking them to investigate Wells Fargo. 

<p>Although Wells Fargo has denied they engage in predatory lending, they have gradually been making the changes that ACORN demanded. The changes that Wells Fargo announced today continue that process and reflect Wells Fargo's recognition of the strength of the ACORN case.
