<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRINCETON, NJ -- April 28 --  A protest of a proposal to eliminate the filibuster in  the U.S. Senate has entered its 59th hour at Princeton University.  Organized in response to the expected &quot;Nuclear Option&quot; vote in the  Senate, a group of concerned Princeton University students and  community members are staging a open-ended filibuster in front of the  Frist Campus Center, a campus building funded by Nuclear Option  advocate and Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest started at 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 26, and will  continue as long as community members come forward to speak - currently  the schedule is full well into Friday afternoon. Speakers continued  through the night and despite rain and heckling to show their support  for the 200-year-old Senate filibuster.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protesters have read from biographies of the judicial nominees, poetry  (Robert Burns), parts of the Constitution, the Declaration of  Independence, Princeton's Rights Rules and Responsibilities policy, the  Princeton University student phonebook through middle of the Bs,  several articles and editorials on Justice Sunday, some environmental  <br>quality articles, children's books, as well as occasional ad-libbing.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest is being held in front of a building funded by $25 million  personally donated by Princeton alumni and Senator Bill Frist and his  family.[1] &quot;Sen. Frist told the Princeton Spectator 2001 he hoped the  Frist Campus Center would be a place where there would be an 'exchange  of ideas'&quot; Said organizer Juan Melli-Huber. &quot;Ironically, his Nuclear  Option proposal would do the opposite, and silence debate in the U.S.  Senate. We are calling on him to state publicly he will abandon his  efforts to railroad through judicial nominees.&quot; [2]</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest was mentioned on CNN's &quot;Morning Grind&quot; newsletter, covered  by Josh Marshall's popular blog Talking Points Memo, and on the  nationally syndicated Thom Hartmann radio program. It was also featured today on CNN's &quot;Inside Politics.&quot;The students are live-blogging the protest at <a href="http://progrev.blogspot.com/" target="_new">http://progrev.blogspot.com/</a>, and have created a webcam with a live  video stream of the filibuster here: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Epetehill/filibuster.html" target="_new">http://www.princeton.edu/~petehill/filibuster.html</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event is being organized by a group of concerned students and is  also sponsored by the Princeton Progressive Review, the Idealistic  Nation, the College Democrats and Mercer County Democracy for America.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
