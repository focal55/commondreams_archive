The judges praised Bhutan&#146;s &#147;excellent environmental track record, with more than 74 per cent of its land under forest cover, and 26 per cent of this cover designated as protected areas.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kingdom&#146;s decision that development should be pursued in a sustainable way is very much in line with the UN Millennium Development Goals. Also notable are the country&#146;s legislation and policies that ensure the sustainable use of resources, promote community involvement in environmental activities, improve land use planning, and integrate traditional with modern natural resource use practices.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan</b> of the United Arab Emirates receives the award for the West Asia region for his &#147;lifetime work&#148; to protect his country&#146;s environment, and his &#147;widely acclaimed&#148; contributions to agriculture, afforestation and species protection. One of Sheikh Zayed&#146;s most enduring achievements is the greening of the region&#146;s deserts. Under his leadership, 100 million trees were planted, hunting was outlawed more than a quarter of a century ago, and a sanctuary was established on the island of Sir Bani Yas to safeguard such endangered species as the Arabian oryx and the sand gazelle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>This selection of Sheikh Zayed</b>, decided before he passed away, comes ahead of the United Nations International Year of Deserts and Desertification in 2006. The presentation of the award recognizing the late Sheikh&#146;s environmental achievements will be made to his eldest son Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the United Arab Emirates on 18 April.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew</b>, known in Europe as the &#145;Green Patriarch,&#146; has taken the lead among religious leaders in his concern for the environment. His Holiness, who was born in the village of Aghioi Theodoroi on the Aegean island of Imvros in Turkey, has initiated seminars and dialogues to discuss the need for the mobilization of moral and spiritual forces to achieve harmony between humankind and nature. Among his many environmental achievements is a series of symposia on the conservation of the seas, as part of Religion, Science and the Environment, with the latest being The Caspian Sea &#150; Linking People and Traditions. The symposium also aims to encourage understanding and a dialogue between the Christian and Islamic faiths.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>President Thabo Mbek</b>i and the people of South Africa have been given the Africa award for the country&#146;s &#147;commitment to cultural and environmental diversity&#148; and its efforts towards achieving the goals encapsulated in the 2000 Millennium Declaration and the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Plan of Implementation. Particularly noteworthy are its achievements in meeting the Johannesburg targets on providing clean water and sanitation, and its world leadership in conservation practices, including &#147;spearheading of the groundbreaking sponsorship of the Peace Parks concept to support cross-border conservation of critically important wild habitats.&#148; With the declaration of four new Marine Protected Areas in 2004, South Africa has brought almost 19 per cent of its coastline under protection, nearly achieving the 20 per cent target set at WSSD.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>As President of South Africa</b>, Mr. Mbeki is well known as one of the architects of the New Partnership for Africa&#146;s Development (NEPAD), which has a strong environmental component.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Julia Carabias Lillo</b> receives the award for Latin America and the Caribbean for her efforts in coordinating research and rural development programmes in extremely impoverished peasant communities in the four regions of Mexico and for her &#147;success in working with different sectors that include government, academia and civil society.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her appointment as President of the National Ecology Institute, and subsequently as Mexico&#146;s Minister of Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries, in 1994, reflect her many achievements, as does her appointment in 2002 as Chair of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel of the Global Environment Facility.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sheila Watt-Cloutier</b> receives the North American award for her &#147;contributions in addressing global warming&#148; and in articulating her people&#146;s concerns &#147;in the face of the devastating effects of climate change and its relentless assault on Inuit traditional life.&#148; The judges also cite her &#147;exemplary contribution to global efforts to eliminate persistent organic pollutants, which pose a particular threat to Arctic peoples and ecosystems.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>As President of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference</b>, which represents some 155,000 Inuit people in Canada, the United States, Russia and Greenland, and as Vice-president of the national Inuit organization &#150; Inuit Tapirisat of Canada &#150; she is applying her vast experience and knowledge at the international level as a highly effective spokesperson on a wide range of Artic and indigenous issues.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Finally, Zhou Qiang and the All-China</b> Youth Federatio n are given a special award in recognition of Mr Zhou&#146;s &#147;outstanding achievements&#148; as honorary chairman of the Federation and leader of the China Mother River Protection Operation, which mobilised 300 million Chinese youth to protect the environment. The judges praised the Federation as &#147;a very important force for protecting the environment&#148;, recalling that it has undertaken 882 afforestation projects covering 191,000 hectares.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The All-China Youth Federation is the only national youth association in China and represents an important force for protecting the environment. In addition, exchanges and cooperation in the field of environmental protection have been fostered among young people in more than 50 countries around the world.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Note to Editors</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Journalists wishing to attend the award ceremony and/or arrange interviews with UNEP or the Champions laureates should contact:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eric Falt, Spokesperson/Director of UNEP's Division of Communications and Public Information (DCPI), on Tel: 254-20 62 3292, Mobile: 254 (0) 733 682 656 or 1 (917) 434-9338,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E-mail:<a href="mailto:eric.falt@unep.org" target="_new">eric.falt@unep.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nick Nuttall, UNEP Head of Media, on Tel: 254 20 62 3084, Mobile: 254 (0) 733 632755,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E-mail: <a href="mailto:nick.nuttall@unep.org" target="_new">nick.nuttall@unep.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elisabeth Guilbaud-Cox, Head of Outreach and Special Events, on Tel: 254 20 62 3401,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E-mail: <a href="mailto:elisabeth.guilbaud-cox@unep.org" target="_new">elisabeth.guilbaud-cox@unep.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jim Sniffen, Information Officer, New York Liaison Office, Tel: 1 (212) 963-8094,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E-mail: <a href="mailto:sniffenj@un.org" target="_new">sniffenj@un.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Background on the Champions of the Earth prize and all the laureates, including biographies and photographs, is available from <a href="http://www.unep.org/champions/" target="_new">http://www.unep.org/champions/</a> or from UNEP DCPI.</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Champions of the Earth award, a new international environment award established in 2004, will be presented by UNEP each year to outstanding environmental achievers and leaders.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No monetary reward is attached to the prize, which is meant to publicize and encourage the worldwide replication of the achievements of the Champions of the Earth.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each laureate receives a trophy especially designed by the Kenyan sculptor Kioko and made of recycled metal.
