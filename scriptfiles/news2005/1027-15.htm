<p>WASHINGTON - Congress voted yesterday to weaken the nation's organic 
        food standards in response to pressure from large-scale food manufacturers. 
      </p>
      <p>The Organic Trade Association (OTA) and food processors have been pressing 
        Congress to change the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) to allow for 
        the use of numerous synthetic substances in products labeled &quot;organic&quot; 
        and to weaken organic dairy standards. </p>
      <p>A recent court decision ruled that the OFPA does not allow synthetic 
        (non-natural) ingredients to be used in foods labeled &quot;organic&quot; 
        and that the act must ensure a strong standard under which dairy cows 
        are converted to organic milk production. After rejecting efforts by members 
        of the public interest and environmental community to reach an agreement 
        on these issues, major food processors in the organic food industry, including 
        Smucker's, Dean Foods, and Kraft, pushed Congress to &quot;quietly&quot; 
        change the law to allow the use of such synthetic ingredients and potentially 
        weaken the organic dairy standards. </p>

      <p>&quot;Congress voted last night to weaken the national organic standards 
        that consumers count on to preserve the integrity of the organic label,&quot; 
        said Ronnie Cummins, National Director of the Organic Consumers Association.. 
        &quot;The process was profoundly undemocratic and the end result is a 
        serious setback for the multi billion dollar alternative food and farming 
        system that the organic community has so painstakingly built up over the 
        past 35 years. The rider will take away the traditional role of the organic 
        community and the National Organic Standards Board in monitoring and controling 
        organic standards. Industry's stealth attack has unnecessarily damaged 
        the standards that helped organic foods become the fastest growing sector 
        in the food industry.&quot; </p>
      <p><b>As passed, the amendment sponsored by the Organic Trade Association 
        allows:</b></p>
      <p>&middot; Numerous synthetic food additives and processing aids, including 
        over 500 food contact substances, to be used in organic foods without 
        public review.</p>
      <p>&middot; Young dairy cows to continue to be treated with antibiotics 
        and fed genetically engineered feed prior to being converted to organic 
        production.</p>

      <p>&middot; Loopholes under which non-organic ingredients could be substituted 
        for organic ingredients without any notification of the public based on 
        &quot;emergency decrees.&quot; </p>
      <p>The amendment was vigorously opposed by consumer, retail and growers 
        groups, as well as public health and environmental groups, including National 
        Cooperative Grocers Association, National Organic Coalition and Rural 
        Advancement Foundation International &shy; USA, Beyond Pesticides, National 
        Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture, Organic Consumers Association, and 
        Consumers Union. Consumers sent more than 300,000 letters to Congress 
        imploring members to stand up against industry's efforts to weaken the 
        organic standards.</p>
      <p>In October 2002, just days after the rules governing organic under NOP 
        were implemented, Maine blueberry farmer Arthur Harvey filed suit against 
        USDA claiming that the USDA regulations governing foods labeled &quot;organic&quot; 
        contravened several principles of the OFPA. Having initially lost on all 
        counts, Harvey prevailed in January 2005 when the Court of Appeals ruled 
        in his favor on the three counts finding:</p>

      <p>1. Synthetic substances are not permitted in processing of items labeled 
        as &quot;organic,&quot; and only allowed in the &quot;made with organic&quot; 
        labeling category.<br>
        <br>
        2. Provisions allowing up to 20-percent non-organic feed in the first 
        nine months of a dairy herd's one-year conversion to organic production 
        are not permitted.<br>
        <br>
        3. All exemptions for the use of non-organic products &quot;not commercially 
        available in organic form&quot; must be reviewed by National Organic Standards 
        Board, and certifiers must review the operator's attempt to source organic. <!-- #EndEditable -->
