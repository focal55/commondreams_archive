<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - July 22  - Experts from the 
U.S. and Central America warned that the Central America Free Trade Agreement 
(CAFTA) will undermine access to life-saving treatment for AIDS and other public 
health problems in the region.<BR><BR>CAFTA is expected to be voted on in the 
House of Representatives next week.<BR><BR>"With CAFTA, the Office of the US 
Trade Representative, operating at the behest of Big Pharma, has imposed on 
Central America and the Dominican Republic a trade deal that will deny millions 
access to life-saving and essential medicines. Through a variety of mechanisms, 
the trade deal extends monopoly protections for brand-name drug companies, and 
delays the introduction of generic competition -- the most effective means of 
lowering the price of pharmaceuticals. For Big Pharma, these are dollars and 
cents issues writ small.&nbsp; The region's combined economy is about the size 
of Columbus, Ohio, and its poor populations mostly cannot afford high-priced 
brand name pharmaceuticals. But what for Big Pharma is dollars and cents is life 
and death for the people of Central America. Monopoly prices for pharmaceuticals 
don't just mean they feel a pinch in their pocketbook -- it means they go 
without medicines 
altogether."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Robert 
Weissman, Co-Director, Essential Action, Washington

202.387.8030, c:202.360.1844; e mail: rob@essential.org<BR><BR>"The deal-making 
currently underway to attempt to pass CAFTA in the US Congress blatantly ignores 
the needs and interests of people in Central America and the Dominican Republic, 
particularly the poor who will be further limited in their access to life-saving 
drugs. If passed, CAFTA will extend drug patents and limit the ability of 
governments in these countries to introduce generic competition, which is 
particularly damaging to poor patients who buy medicines out-of-pocket. Trade 
agreements should offer economic opportunity and development, not impediments to 
public 
health."<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

sweinberg@oxfamamerica.org<BR><BR>"Almost four years ago, under pressure from 
poor countries, the Bush Administration signed a declaration at the World Trade 
Organization Ministerial meeting in Doha pledging that WTO members should 
prioritize public health and, in particular, access to medicines for all when 
adopting national rules governing protection of drug company patent rights. The 
U.S. has broken that promise in CAFTA. In going back on its word, the White 
House has decided that being at Big Pharma's beck and call is more important 
than ensuring Central Americans have access to medicines that can save their 
lives."<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

GAP<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; web:

267.475.2645; email: asia@healthgap.org<BR><BR>"The text of CAFTA is a major 
score for Big Pharma. In the name of 'free trade', monopolies for medicines are 
being created or extended beyond what they would be under WTO rules, which are 
already in place. In the end, it is impossible to justify how adopting 
intellectual property rules that go well beyond the WTO commitments and even 
U.S. law is a good idea for poor countries. CAFTA's new rules will cost human 
lives."<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
