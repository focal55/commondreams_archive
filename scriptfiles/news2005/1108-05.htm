<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 8 - The House International Relations Committee will vote on Wednesday on a Resolution of Inquiry, offered by Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), demanding all documents produced by the White House Iraq Group (WHIG).  

<p>The Kucinich Resolution (H. Res. 505), which is co-sponsored by 66 Members of Congress, demands the White House turn over to Congress all white papers, minutes, notes, emails or other communications kept by the White House Iraq Group (WHIG). 

<p>"This resolution is about accountability and Congress' Constitutional duty to provide oversight," stated Kucinich. 

<p>"We now know that the Administration hyped intelligence and misled the American public and Congress in their effort to 'sell' the war," continued Kucinich. "This group, comprised of the President and Vice President's top aides, was critical in this effort. It is long past time that this Congress asks serious questions about what role key White House aides played in 'selling' the war to the Congress and the American public"

<p>A Resolution of Inquiry is a rare House procedure used to obtain documents from the Executive Branch. Under House rules, Kucinich's resolution was referred to the International Relations Committee and they are required to act within 14 legislative days. Kucinich introduced his resolution on October 20th. 

<p>The House International Relations Committee is set to meet at 10:30am, Wednesday, November 9th, in room 2172 Rayburn HOB, to consider the Kucinich resolution.
