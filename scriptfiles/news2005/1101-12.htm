<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON -- Common Cause, the Center for Digital Democracy and Free Press today admonished the board of directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to open a closed-door meeting on the results of an investigation into wrongdoing by former Chairman Kenneth Tomlinson.

<p>Inspector General Kenneth Konz is expected to present his findings -- which reportedly included ethical and procedural violations as well as misuse of funds -- today in a private meeting of the CPB board of directors, of which Tomlinson remains a member.

<p>In a letter delivered to CPB Chairwoman Cheryl Halpern and President Patricia de Stacy Harrison, the groups called for the Inspector General’s report to be made public immediately and criticized the board for further compounding its problems with transparency and accountability by reviewing the report in secret.

<p>A copy of the letter follows:


<p>November 1, 2005

<p>Cheryl Halpern, Chair
Patricia Harrison, President and Chief Executive Officer
Corporation for Public Broadcasting
401 Ninth Street, NW Washington, DC 20004-2129

<p>Dear Ms. Halpern and Ms. Harrison:

<p>We urge you to release publicly today the Inspector General’s report that has been given to the Board of Directors. Today’s CPB Board meeting should also be opened to the public.

<p>We are frankly dismayed that the Board would treat the report in a secretive manner not befitting a taxpayer-funded, public entity. The Inspector General’s report allegedly discusses violations or problems related to Board governance and procedures, including the lack of transparency and accountability. You are compounding these problems by your decision to hide the report and your discussion of its findings behind closed doors.

<p>We look forward to your immediate response to our request. 
<p>Sincerely,

<p>Jeff Chester<br>
Executive Director
