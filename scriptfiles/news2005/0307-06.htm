<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 7 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">News Advisory:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Events at Nation's Capitol Intended to Save 8,000-plus Wild Horses from Slaughter and to Help Pass Bills to End All Horse Slaughter in the United States</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Horse Defense Fund (AHDF), the nation's premier horse protection, education and advocacy nonprofit, has organized a 3 day event to educate Members of Congress and their staff about horse slaughter in for human consumption, and the impending slaughter of thousands of wild horses that threatens the long- term viability of this icon of the west. During the 3 day event, organization leaders and concerned citizens will discuss and advocate for the passage of two important pieces of legislation targeted to protect the American wild horse and to end the brutal practice of horse slaughter: H.R. 297, a bill introduced by Reps. Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.) and Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.), reinstates the 34 year old federal protections that would prevent the slaughter of our wild horses; and H.R. 503, The American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act, introduced by Reps. Sweeney (R-N.Y.) and Spratt (D-S.C.), which would put an end to all horse slaughter.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event kicks off with National Capitol Hill Day for Horses on Monday, March 7 during which concerned citizens will visit House and Senate offices to lobby for passage of this important legislation. On Tuesday, leaders from national organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States, the American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, American Humane Association, the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign and Return To Freedom will host a formal briefing for House and Senate legislative aides, detailing the facts about horse slaughter and dispelling the myth of wild horse overpopulation. The 3 day event will culminate with a press conference on Wednesday, where Members of Congress will address the urgency of this legislation, followed by presentations from national wild horse, equine, and humane organizations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who: National Organizations, Members of Congress</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What: Press Conference re the impending slaughter of thousands of American wild horses</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When: Wednesday, March 9, 10 a.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where: 1334 Longworth House Office Building, Washington, D.C.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information after March 4, call 808-640-5867.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
