<p> WASHINGTON - November 15  - Public Citizen is pleased to announce the launch of a new consumer advocacy organization from within its own ranks: Food and Water Watch, a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting food and water through research, education, lobbying, e-activism and media outreach.

<p>Wenonah Hauter, currently the director of the Critical Mass Energy Program, which houses the existing food and water programs, will be leaving Public Citizen to run this new organization. She will be accompanied by the employees who have helped develop these programs over the past eight years. This move will allow these campaigns to expand with new resources to achieve the vital mission of protecting our food and water from increased corporate control, factory farming and privatization.

<p>Food and Water Watch will be devoted to maintaining the existing partnerships the staff has cultivated while at Public Citizen with other non-governmental organizations and citizens.

<p>On behalf of Public Citizen, we all wish Food and Water Watch the very best. Stay tuned to <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org">www.foodandwaterwatch.org</a> for more details.
