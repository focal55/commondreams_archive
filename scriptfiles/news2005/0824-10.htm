<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->GENEVA - August 24 -<i> </i>On Wednesday, 24 August 2005, one Azerbaijani serviceman previously detained in Armenia was repatriated under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The operation took place in the Tavush and Gazakh regions on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

<p>The ICRC, participating as a neutral intermediary and in accordance with its mandate, facilitated the repatriation of the released prisoner at the request of the authorities of the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan. 

<p>ICRC delegates visited the serviceman before the operation to ensure he was returning home of his own free will. 

<p>In accordance with its mandate, the ICRC has assisted in the repatriation or transfer of 652 persons since the start of its activities in relation to the Nagorny Karabakh conflict in 1992. The ICRC stands ready to provide support for any similar operation in the future, should the need arise. <!-- #EndEditable -->
