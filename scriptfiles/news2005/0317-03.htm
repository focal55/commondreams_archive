<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 17 -- Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced the introduction of legislation to prevent the government from censoring the content on popular cable T.V. shows and Internet websites.  Sanders&#146; proposal is in response to recently approved House legislation increasing Federal Communication Commission (FCC) &#147;indecency&#148; fines for broadcast television and radio. The Senate is considering companion legislation and some in the Senate have proposed imposing these same &quot;indecency&quot; regulations on programming provided over cable, satellite, and the Internet.  If this proposal were adopted, Americans would be unable to view popular shows like The Sopranos and The Daily Show or would only be able to watch them late at night.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &#147;There is a growing culture of censorship in this country that needs to be ended.  First they went after broadcast television and radio and now they want to censor cable, satellite and the Internet. The bottom line is that government commissars should not be the arbiters of what Americans see and hear, especially over cable, satellite and the Internet -- all of which people have to pay for in order to receive.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders legislation clarifies that the FCC&#146;s power to regulate indecency applies only to material broadcast over public airwaves and would forbid application of the regulations to cable, satellite, the internet or other mediums that are selected and paid for by consumers. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders continued, &quot;We don't need the FCC bleeping Tony Soprano or Jon Stewart.  Allowing the FCC to regulate these venues would, in affect, permit the government to control what content people can purchase.  That offends basic American principles of freedom and liberty that are the foundation of our democracy.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. House approved the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005 (HR. 310) on February 16, 2005. This legislation increased fines for &#147;indecent&#148; material broadcast over public airways to $500,000. The Senate is currently considering companion legislation. Sanders is gathering Congressional cosponsors and intends to introduce his legislation this week. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
