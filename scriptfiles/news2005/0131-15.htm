<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 31 --  In conjunction with the State of the Union address, the Sierra Club is running TV and print ads to highlight the energy solutions President Bush can employ now to free America from dependence on fossil fuels.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As President Bush prepares to deliver the 2005 State of the Union address, his administration and its allies in Congress are preparing to revive an energy bill that is rooted in the past and relies on outdated, polluting energy sources,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of Sierra Club. &quot;Instead of giveaways to the energy dinosaurs, President Bush should use the technology of the present to provide solutions to energy, environmental and security concerns.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The TV ad began airing Sunday nationally on CNN and MSNBC and in Washington, DC on the Sunday news talk shows. It will continue airing Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday on the local NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX affiliates, and around the State of the Union on all of those stations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The print ad will run in The Washington Post, Roll Call, The New York Times and National Journal on Wednesday, February 2.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Script of TV ad:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Narrator:<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Imagine an America free to light and heat our homes with safer, cleaner wind or solar power; free from air pollution; from threats to drill our coasts and wild lands. But we don't have to imagine. We know how to end our dependence on oil and fuels of the past. President Bush, use modern technology to set us free. Put Americans to work building energy-saving cars and buildings, and keep our soldiers safe--at home--instead of risking their lives in the oil fields.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Copies of the TV and print ads are available at <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom</a> or by calling 202-675-6698,  or e-mailing <a href="mailto:david.willett@sierraclub.org" target="_new">david.willett@sierraclub.org</a>,<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
