WASHINGTON - The following is a  statement by Roger Hickey, co-director, Campaign for America's  Future, on the White House retreat on Davis Bacon:
<p>   According to press reports, Republican Members of Congress  have announced that the White House will reinstate the federal  law requiring &quot;prevailing&quot; local wages to be paid on federally  funded projects in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area.  If these  reports are correct, they mean that President Bush has bowed to  citizen pressure mobilized by groups like the Campaign for  America's Future, America's labor unions, and Democratic members  of Congress -- pressure that has forced the White House to  reverse a misguided and cruel executive decree issued immediately  after Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p>   &quot;Much of the credit for this victory must go to Congressman  George Miller,&quot; said Roger Hickey, Co-Director of the Campaign  for America's Future.  &quot;Miller crafted legislation to overturn  the President's decree -- and then found an innovative way to  force a vote on the bill in the House of Representatives.  But  this is also a victory for the citizen groups who mobilized,  first to convince all Democratic Members of Congress to co- sponsor the legislation -- and then to embarrass enough  Republican Members into deciding that they could not vote to  sustain President Bush's low wage decree.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future, which just yesterday helped  to bring 17 Katrina survivors to Capitol Hill, has repeatedly  encouraged their online activist network, numbering several  hundreds of thousands of people to express their outrage to  Members of Congress about Bush's edict depriving Gulf citizens of  decent wages in federally funded reconstruction projects.  (See  emails below.)  The group estimates that each time they sent out  one of their email action alerts on Davis-Bacon, over 20 thousand  CAF activists from all over the country, sent an urgent  communication to their Member of Congress and Senator -- via fax  or telephone or email.</p>
<p>   &quot;Clearly, the White House understood that Congressman Miller  had found a way, under the little-used 1976 National Emergencies  Act, to force a vote in Congress, and clearly the President  understood that Congress would vote to overturn his misguided  decree,&quot; said Hickey.</p>
<p>   &quot;Coming on the heels of the acknowledged defeat of Bush's  Social Security privatization plan -- and on the eve of a likely  failure by the Republicans in Congress to push through draconian  budget cuts to pay for wasteful tax cuts for the rich -- this  capitulation by the White House represents another victory for  activist progressive action. It means a victory for democracy --  and a victory for the people of the Gulf states.&quot;</p>

<p>   Dear Roger,</p>
<p>   President Bush is using the Katrina tragedy to  opportunistically push a radical agenda of tax cuts for the  wealthy, new big-oil give-aways, school vouchers, and an array of  other right wing nostrums. But Americans are getting wise to how  President Bush and his party operate. Tom DeLay was just indicted  for illegally funneling corporate money to benefit GOP  politicians. And, large majorities have turned against Bush on  his handling of both the Katrina fiasco and the ongoing mess in  Iraq.</p>
<p>   And now, we have an opportunity to deal the extreme right-wing  another blow by overturning the President's decree that cut wages  for Katrina victims hired to rebuild their shattered communities.</p>
<p>   Thanks in part to pressure from our supporters -- who  responded to an urgent email last week -- every single Democrat  and Independent in the House of Representatives has united behind  a bill to overturn the President's callous wage-cutting decree.  We now need just 14 Republicans to endorse this bill -- to show  that a clear majority of House Members want a vote to restore  fair wages for Gulf Coast reconstruction workers.</p>

<p>   Please, sign the petition that we'll send to every single  Republican member of Congress asking them to co-sponsor and bring  to vote the &quot;Fair Wages for Hurricane Victims Act.&quot;</p>

<p>   This is a battle we can win! Just last week, 37 Republicans  wrote to President Bush asking him to &quot;temporarily&quot; restore fair  wages protections. Now, we need to translate these good  intentions into concrete action. Please help turn up the heat on  moderate Republicans and deliver the President and right wing  extremists a clear message: Gulf Coast reconstruction must work - - first and foremost -- for the people of the Gulf, not just the  Haliburtons and other large corporations seeking to profit from  this tragedy.</p>
<p>   President Bush's wage-cutting decree started the Gulf Coast  reconstruction effort on exactly the wrong note. If we can defeat  the president on this, we will send his administration the larger  message that Americans want Gulf reconstruction to be devoted to  helping Katrina victims get useful jobs, earn decent wages, and  support their families. Please, sign the petition and challenge  Republican members of Congress to co-sponsor and bring to a vote  the &quot;Fair Wages for Hurricane Victims Act!&quot;</p>

<p>   Campaign for America's Future</p>
<p>   Dear Roger,</p>
<p>   Last night, President Bush addressed the nation and told  victims of Hurricane Katrina that &quot;we will do what it takes, to  help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives&quot;. But he  didn't tell them how he has already tilted the rules for  reconstruction to benefit those of wealth and privilege, while  undermining the poor and middle-class families who have suffered  the most. Instead of embracing good jobs for the recently displaced,  President Bush's first major act in the recovery effort was to  suspend a law that requires federal contractors to pay workers a  decent wage. And, at the same time, his administration signed no- bid contracts that will give billions to multi-national  corporations like Halliburton without any guarantee that they  will hire displaced people to rebuild their own communities.</p>
<p>   If President Bush gets away with cutting wages for those  involved in rebuilding, then we might as well hand the whole job  over to corporate greed. We need you to engage in the first  battle of what promises to be a long fight to ensure that the  recovery effort is one that puts people first -- and not one that  lines the pockets of corporate elites. Please, write your member  of Congress and demand that decent family wages and employing the  victims of Katrina be the bedrock of the rebuilding efforts.</p>
<p>   <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=55671&Link=http://ourfuture.org/rebuilding_wages.cfm">http://ourfuture.org/rebuilding_wages.cfm</a></p>

<p>   Progressives stand resolute that we should rebuild the Gulf  Coast for the victims of Katrina -- not just the privileged few.  In the America we believe in, everyone that works hard should be  entitled to a decent wage -- especially the people we want to  help get back on their feet after this enormous disaster. We must  reject the fundamental insult of the president's decree that Gulf  Coast reconstruction workers should be paid low wages.</p>
<p>   We believe that economic fairness should drive the rebuilding  effort. Our government has an important role to play in guiding  the economy so that we collectively build an expansive, enduring  middle class. That's why the people who were hit by the storm  must be treated justly and paid good wages for their hard work  reconstructing their destroyed communities.</p>
<p>   If we allow Bush's hucksterism to lull the Congress into  overlooking his first outrageous action against the people of the  Gulf, it will be just the beginning. The right wing is already  advancing plans to use the Katrina emergency to steamroll  legislation that rolls back environmental protections, suspends  affirmative action and showers corporations with billions in tax  breaks.</p>
<p>   Please take action now to stop the right wing's first Katrina- related opportunism before it permeates the reconstruction  effort. Tell your lawmakers to say no to corporate greed, and to  ensure fair wages for Gulf Coast reconstruction workers.</p>
<p>   <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=55671&Link=http://ourfuture.org/rebuilding_wages.cfm">http://ourfuture.org/rebuilding_wages.cfm</a></p>
<p>   When the people of the Gulf first needed help, George Bush's  administration failed them. This is a unique moment in history  where we can, and must, end the politics of privilege that have  dominated our government under President Bush. It does not get  much clearer than this -- it is time to put the needs of the many  over the needs of the few. If we win this battle, it can set an  important precedent for all of our work ahead to rebuild the Gulf  Coast and rebuild America: the right wing agenda that favors  privilege over people has no place here, and will not be  tolerated.</p>

<p>   Congressman George Miller has just introduced legislation to  reinstate the wage protections that were suspended by decree of  President Bush. Championed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt,  these protections require federal contractors to pay &quot;prevailing&quot;  wages to workers. It's amazing that in the face of tragedy,  President Bush still puts the interests of his corporate federal  contractor friends ahead of the workers that will rebuild the  Gulf. Tell your member of Congress that rebuilding the Gulf Coast  must mean more than just profits for big corporations -- it must  empower those recently displaced to make a decent wage while they  rebuild their shattered communities and lives.</p>
<p>   <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=55671&Link=http://ourfuture.org/rebuilding_wages.cfm">http://ourfuture.org/rebuilding_wages.cfm</a></p>
<p>   According to the Wall Street Journal, &quot;Congressional  Republicans, backed by the White House, say they are using relief  measures for the hurricane-ravaged Gulf coast to achieve a broad  range of conservative economic and social policies, both in the  storm zone and beyond.&quot; (1)</p>
<p>   We can't let this happen. The difference between our hope and  their agenda is rooted in the fundamental idea that all people  must be treated with dignity and respect. While the conservatives  tell us that &quot;You are on your own,&quot; we progressives believe that  &quot;We can solve any problem together.&quot; We have a plan to rebuild  the Gulf Coast and rebuild America. And, ours are the priorities  that put people first.</p>

<p>   The battle begins with employing the recently displaced in  good paying jobs. Tell your member of Congress to restore wage  protections and give every displaced worker the salary they need  to have a fair shot at rebuilding their lives.</p>

<p>   Thank you so much for all you do.</p>

<p>   P.S. We need you to help us get the word out. Please, forward  this email to your friends and post these comments on your  favorite blog or message board. Help us spread the word that now  is the time to redefine America's priorities.</p>

<p>   Dear Roger,</p>

<p>   $1 to Bring Katrina Survivors to DC</p>
<p>   If we can raise $20,000, we will bring at least five Katrina  survivors to Washington, DC this month to meet face-to-face with  politicians and press them for a straight answer on a vital  question:  Are Washington politicians rebuilding the Gulf Coast  for their wealthy friends, or the people of the Gulf? Please contribute $1 today to help Katrina survivors speak truth  to power -- directly in Washington -- and confront the right- wing's callous agenda in the Gulf! GO &quot;</p>
<p>   President Bush and his right wing allies continue to exploit  the tragedy in the Gulf to line the pockets of their corporate  friends -- adding to the burden of survivors still struggling to  rebuild their lives.  From cutting wages for reconstruction  workers, to showering billions in no-bid contracts to companies  like Halliburton, to suspending environmental protections, and  lavishing even more hand-outs on big oil, the right wing is on a  rampage -- exploiting the Gulf tragedy to enrich their wealthy  friends while the people of the Gulf continue to suffer.</p>
<p>   How does the right-wing get away with it?  Because  conservative politicians have tucked themselves away in  Washington (except for brief photo-op visits to the Gulf) and  effectively removed themselves from the harsh realities of their  policy-making. They can pass policy after policy that harms the  people of the Gulf because they don't have to confront the people  they're burdening.</p>
<p>   Together, we can confront the right-wing's escapism, and  challenge the disastrous policies to which it's given rise.  If  we raise $20,000, we will bring at least five Katrina survivors  to Capitol Hill to press politicians for a straight answer on a  vital question:  Are they rebuilding the Gulf Coast for their  wealthy friends, or the people of the Gulf?</p>
<p>   Everyone can contribute at least $1 to help Katrina survivors  speak truth to power directly in Washington!  Please make at  least that small contribution today, and help give voice to those  still struggling to rebuild their lives in the Gulf.</p>

<p>   Meet Gwendolyn Carriere, a 66-year resident of New Orleans  who, along with her three children and eight grandchildren, lost  nearly everything in Katrina. Her home, her car and her family  business were all destroyed, and she lost two of her family  members. Despite these tragedies, Mrs. Carriere's spirits and  determination to rebuild for her family are, in her own words,  &quot;strong and thriving&quot;.  With your help, we will bring Mrs.  Carriere to Washington to ask President Bush and Congress  directly:  &quot;Are you rebuilding the Gulf Coast for your friends,  or my family?&quot;</p>
<p>   Gwendolyn Carriere is one of thousands of Katrina survivors  whose basic needs are being -- at best -- ignored, and -- at  worst -- actively trampled on by today's right-wing policy- making.  Mrs. Carriere's voice and those of her fellow Katrina  survivors must be heard now in Washington DC, and with your help  they will be!  Working alongside our partners at Voices for  Working Families, AFSCME, and ACORN, we will bring Mrs. Carriere  and at least four other Katrina survivors to Washington this  month to confront the right-wing's disastrous agenda in the Gulf  before it takes deeper root.</p>

<p>   No contribution is too small for this work, so please offer  what you can.  Your contribution will go directly to flying Mrs.  Carriere and fellow Katrina survivors to Washington, hosting them  here for two days, and organizing them to meet with lawmakers and  the media, to press for the answers and support they deserve.</p>

<p>   If each of us contributes even $1, we will show Washington  that there's a powerful network of support behind those still  struggling in the Gulf -- a base of support that stands behind  people like Gwendolyn Carriere as they stand up for fellow  Katrina survivors and for all Americans whose basic needs  continue to be undermined by the right wing. Please contribute your dollar today!</p>

<p>   Thanks advance for helping to give voice in Washington to  those still struggling in the Gulf.  With our collective support,  their voices will be heard!</p>
