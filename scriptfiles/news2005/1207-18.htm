<p>MAP TA PHUT, Thailand - December 7 - With its flagship the Rainbow 
Warrior looking on, Greenpeace activists today climbed the loading crane 
of the BLCP coal plant at Map Ta Phut in Thailand and unfurled banners 
demanding the plant's immediate closure, calling on the Thai government 
to phase out coal power and to commit to renewable energy.
           
<p>"The catastrophic droughts across Thailand this year cost the country US 
$193 million - climate change is causing severe hardship here and across 
the Southeast Asia region (1) and plants like BLCP are the main 
culprits," said Greenpeace Southeast Asia's Energy spokesperson Tara 
Buakamsri from   Map Ta Phut.

<p>Greenpeace believes that the Thai government will not be able to deliver 
on its promise of an 8% renewable energy target by 2011 as long as it 
continues to give the go-ahead to new coal-fired plants like BLCP.

<p>"Climate change is a reality but so too are the solutions," said 
Jean-Francois Fauconnier of Greenpeace International aboard the Rainbow 
Warrior.  "Wind, solar and modern biomass power are already big business 
not only in Europe but also in China. The potential in Thailand is 
equally huge. (2)

<p>"International financial institutions like the Asian Development Bank 
and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation should stop financing 
coal. They continuously talk up their support for renewables yet we've 
seen very little in the way of funds being re-directed towards 
alternatives. No more talk, it's time for action."

<p>Signatories to the Kyoto Protocol are currently meeting in Montreal to 
discuss targets for reducing greenhouse emissions beyond 2012.  
"Industrialised nations should not only commit to a 30% reduction by 
2020 and 80% by 2050 (3) in their own domestic greenhouse gas emissions 
but they should also stop exporting climate change to developing 
countries. (4) They ought to assist these countries to embrace 
renewables," concluded Fauconnier.

<p>The activity is part of an international protest by Greenpeace against 
new coal power plants. In Germany activists have been  protesting since 
Monday on top a cooling tower of the RWE energy company, Europe's 
biggest CO2 polluter.
   
<p>Greenpeace's flagship the Rainbow Warrior is in Bangkok on the Thailand 
leg of its 10-week Asia Energy Revolution Tour, exposing the impacts of 
climate change and promoting the uptake of renewable energy like wind 
and modern biomass. The tour started in Australia and will end in Thailand.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to drive solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
<p>Notes:

<p>1. 9.2 million people were affected by the drought that damaged some 
800,000 hectares at a cost of $US193.2 million. Subsequently, the 2005 
rice crop in Thailand is expected to fall by between 11-14%. Similarly 
drastic falls are expected in national sugar cane production. Source: AP

<p>2. Renewables can provide 35% of Thailand's energy supply by 2020 -there 
already exists enough biomass to power 25% of the country's electricity 
needs. Burning our Future, p5. See www.asiacleanenergy.org

<p>3. This figure is based on the fact that global temperatures need to be 
kept below 2°C to prevent dangerous climate change.

<p>4. Australia is the world's largest coal exporter. 80% of its coal goes 
to Asia.
For instance, the Map Ta Phut BLCP plant will require approximately 3.5 
million tonnes of coal per year, all of which will be supplied by Rio 
Tinto, an Australian company.
