<p>WASHINGTON - November 17 - Media Matters for  America is deeply troubled by the lack of news coverage of a  speech critical of the Bush administration given by Sen. Chuck  Hagel (R-Neb.) on Nov. 15 in response to remarks by the President  days earlier that those who have accused the White House of  manipulating intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war are  sending "the wrong signal to our troops and to an enemy that is  questioning America's will." </p>
<p>   Sen. Hagel reacted by saying that the administration's attack  on war critics is "not democracy nor what this country has stood  for" and that "(t)he Bush administration must understand that  each American has a right to question our policies in Iraq and  should not be demonized for disagreeing with them."</p>
<p>   Numerous media outlets -- among them The New York Times, the  Los Angeles Times, CBS, ABC, and NBC -- prominently covered  President Bush's Nov. 11 speech. However, those same outlets  ignored public criticism of Bush's remarks delivered at the  Council for Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C by Hagel, who is  a potential Republican presidential candidate.</p>
<p>   "It is unconceivable that news organizations, entrusted with  the responsibility of informing Americans, omitted remarks  critical of the Bush administration delivered by a prominent  member of the President's party," said David Brock, president and  CEO of Media Matters for America. "Not covering Hagel's speech  leaves a distorted view of the current dialogue regarding the  Iraq war."</p>
<p>   Bush's Nov. 11 comments were reported on that evening's  network news broadcasts. NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams  reported that Bush said such criticism "hurts the troops and  helps the enemy"; Bob Scheiffer reported on the CBS Evening News  that Bush accused war critics of "undercutting American troops in  Iraq"; and Bob Woodruff similarly reported on ABC's World News  Tonight Bush's assertion that criticism of the war is  "endangering U.S. troops." On Nov. 12, The New York Times  reported that Bush "sharply criticized Democrats who have accused  him of misleading the nation about the threat from Iraq's weapons  programs, calling their criticism 'deeply irresponsible' and  suggesting that they are undermining the war effort," while the  Los Angeles Times noted that Bush "said his critics were  undermining U.S. troops with their claims."</p>
<p>   But none of those outlets reported Hagel's response to Bush's  comments. The NBC Nightly News did note on Nov. 15 that Hagel  said the United States "should begin drawing down forces in Iraq  next year," but did not include his comments defending the right  to question the war. </p>
<p>   By contrast, Knight Ridder and The Washington Post documented  Hagel's remarks. Knight Ridder noted on Nov. 15 that Hagel  "chided Bush for suggesting several times in recent days that war  critics are undermining American troops and comforting the  enemy." The Post reported on Nov. 16:</p>
<p>   Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) strongly criticized yesterday the  White House's new line of attack against critics of its Iraq  policy, saying that "the Bush administration must understand that  each American has a right to question our policies in Iraq and  should not be demonized for disagreeing with them."</p>
<p>   With President Bush leading the charge, administration  officials have lashed out at Democrats who have accused the  administration of manipulating intelligence to justify the war in  Iraq. Bush has suggested that critics are hurting the war effort,  telling U.S. troops in Alaska on Monday that critics "are sending  mixed signals to our troops and the enemy. And that's  irresponsible."</p>
<p>   Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and a potential presidential  candidate in 2008, countered in a speech to the Council of  Foreign Relations that the Vietnam War "was a national tragedy  partly because members of Congress failed their country, remained  silent and lacked the courage to challenge the administrations in  power until it was too late."</p>
<p>   "To question your government is not unpatriotic -- to not  question your government is unpatriotic," Hagel said, arguing  that 58,000 troops died in Vietnam because of silence by  political leaders. "America owes its men and women in uniform a  policy worthy of their sacrifices."</p>
<p>   Media Matters for America is a Web-based, not-for-profit,  progressive research and information center dedicated to  comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting  conservative misinformation in the U.S. media. Media Matters for  America is the first organization to systematically monitor the  media for conservative misinformation every day, in real time.
