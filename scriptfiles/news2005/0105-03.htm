<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 5 -- </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: Lead plaintiff, Moss v. Bush, Rev. Bill Moss <br>Lead trial counsel, Peter Peckarsky <br>Professor and statistical expert, Ron Baiman, Ph.D. <br>Publisher and lawyer, Bob Fitrakis <br>Lawyer, Susan Truitt <br>Exit polling expert, Jonathan Simon, JD <br>Senior editor, freepress.org. Harvey Wasserman <br>Legal statistician, Richard Hayes-Phillips, Ph.D <br>Director, Progressive Democrats of America, Tim Carpenter <br>NAACP, National Voter Fund, Greg Moore <br>Author Warren Linney, MA (The Patriot Test) </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT:   . Exit polls did not match the reported vote in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and 7 of 8 other  key battleground states <br>. Voting machines with secret software owned by private, partisan companies subject to  manipulation and which deprived citizens of their right to fair and transparent elections <br>. Uncounted and provisional ballots negatively and disproportionately affected African American voters  <br>. Inexplicable vote disparities <br>. Voting Rights Act Violations <br>. Recount did not recount all the votes <br>. Challenge at January 6 Joint Session of Congress </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY:  TO PROVIDE FULL BACKGROUND ON KEY ASSERTIONS PRIOR TO THE HISTORIC CONGRESSIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE 2004 VOTE </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PARTIAL LIST OF EVIDENCE: <br>There is clear and compelling evidence that the election was stolen. By examining a very wide range of sworn testimonies from voters, polling officials and others close to the administration of the Nov. 2 election; by statistical analysis of the certified vote by mathematicians, election experts and independent research teams who have conducted detailed studies of the results in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere; from experts who studied the voting machines, tabulators and other electronic equipment on which a fair vote count has depended; and from a team of attorneys and others who have challenged the Ohio results; the freepress.org investigative team has compiled a portrait  of an election whose true outcome must be investigated further by the Congress, the media and all Americans -- because it was almost certainly not an honest victory for George W. Bush. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Crucial flaws in the national vote count, most importantly in the national popular vote, and in Ohio and Florida indicate John Kerry was the actual winner on November 2, as reported in national exit polls. At the very least, the widespread tampering with how the election was conducted, and how Ohio's votes were counted and re-counted, has compromised this nation's historic commitment to free and fair elections. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George W. Bush's 'victory' appears to have resulted from multiple frauds - a GOP 'do-whatever it takes'  strategy to win the state that swung the election. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The questionable votes far exceed Bush's margin of victory in Ohio. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush-Cheney 'do what ever it takes&quot; strategy in Ohio covered a very wide range of tactics, from disenfranchisement of minority voters to discarding of ballots to tampered tabulators and much more. Taken as a whole, this compendium of error, fraud, cover-up and contempt indicates that this was not a legitimate election, and is not worthy of being certified by the Congress of the United States. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirty disenfranchised voters on the Freedom Winter bus ride from Columbus, Ohio to Washington, D.C. will be present to share their voting horror stories with the media. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: National Press Club <br>Zenger Room <br>529 14th St. NW, 13th Floor <br>Washington, DC 20045 <br>202.662.7500 </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPONSORED BY: Free Press, _www.freepress.org_ (<a href="http://www.freepress.org/" target="_new">http://www.freepress.org/</a>) Citizens Alliance for Secure Elections, _www.caseohio.org_<br>(<a href="http://http://www.caseohio.org/" target="_new">http://www.caseohio.org/</a>) Progressive Democrats of America, _www.pdamerica.org_ (<a href="http://www.pdamerica.org/" target="_new">http://www.pdamerica.org/</a>) We Do Not Concede _www.donotconcede.com_ (<a href="http://www.donotconcede.com/" target="_new">http://www.donotconcede.com/</a>)</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
