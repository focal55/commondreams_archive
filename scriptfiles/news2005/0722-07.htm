<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON  - July 22  -  Responding to pressure by environmental groups and  governments, the London-based United Nations body that regulates  shipping across the world agreed to review air pollution standards</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">for the world's shipping fleet. The current regulations,  adopted in 1997, are outdated and woefully inadequate.  It will take two to three years to finalize any new regulations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The International Maritime Organization (IMO) initiated a process  this week to revise international standards on ship emissions and  marine fuel quality and to consider regulating particulate matter  produced by ship engines for the first time. Limits on existing  engines will also be considered.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Urgent action is needed to protect public health and the  environment from the toxic air pollutants emitted by ship  smokestacks around the world,&quot; said Teri Shore, Clean Vessels  Campaign Director for Bluewater Network.  &quot;We hope that the IMO  will now lead the way to stronger air standards instead of putting  shipping profits first.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Marshall, Senior Counsel for the Clean Air Task Force, stated,  &quot;IMO's action reflects a recognition that shipping emissions are  substantial and growing, but can be reduced substantially by  feasible control techniques currently available.&quot;  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IMO's new plan to revise MARPOL Annex VI was supported by  Bluewater Network, Friends of the Earth International, Coalition for  a Safe Environment, Clean Air Task Force and allied groups as well  as nations including the United States, Canada, Mexico,  United Kingdom, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Spain, Japan, Korea, China, Venezuela and South Africa. Nations that  opposed included Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IMO's action came after environmental groups targeted the  IMO for failing to protect the environment and human health from  global shipping pollution. The problems and technical solutions were outlined in official submissions by Friends of the Earth International to the Marine  Environment Protection Committee. A group of seven European nations also proposed stronger air pollution standards in papers submitted to the IMO.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the IMO convened environmental meetings the week of July 18,  activists released the first-ever Environmental Report Card on the  IMO giving it failing grades on air pollution, human health and  climate change. Community groups offered a Port Community Bill  of Rights to protect people living near ports from air toxics and quality of life impacts caused by air pollution from ships, which is increasing as global trade expands.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ships generate 30 percent of the world's smog-forming nitrogen  oxide emissions. One ship entering port generates the air pollution  of 350,000 cars in one hour. Shipping trade is expected to triple in  the next two decades. People living near ports experience higher  levels of cancer, asthma and respiratory illness.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
