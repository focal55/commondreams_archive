<p>WASHINGTON - November 14  - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on the Bush Administration's attacks on critics of his Iraq policy:

<p>"Let there be no mistake about it, Iraq is Bush's war. The buck stops at his desk and he cannot duck responsibility or accountability for the failure of his war and occupation. It is President Bush's war that has killed over 2,000 American soldiers and injured tens of thousand more. It is President Bush's war that has cost our nation over $200 billion at the expense of domestic priorities such as healthcare, education and disaster relief. And, it is President Bush's war that has made Iraq a training ground for Al-Qaeda terrorists. 

<p>"By attacking war critics, the President is simply trying to change the headlines from the daily reports of failure from Iraq. Failure to secure the country, failure of post-war planning, and most of all, failure of having a plan to bring our troops home and ending this war.

<p>"Empty political rhetoric, false claims and smear tactics against war critics might distract the media for a few days, but it does not change the reality of the war, or the President's failures.

<p>"The President, as much as he may try to help his plummeting poll numbers, cannot rewrite history. Two-thirds of current House Democrats and half of current Senate Democrats opposed the war in Iraq.

<p>"Congress, controlled by Republicans, did vote to authorize the use of force against Iraq. But only after being misled by misinformation, bad intelligence and faulty arguments by the President and his aides.

<p>"The buck stops directly at President Bush's desk for the misleading information, false intelligence and disproven arguments that President Bush, and his Administration, used to lead this nation, and Congress, into war.

<p>"The President cannot claim he was misled as he continues to mislead. While the President seeks to absolve himself from 'false intelligence' he is continuing to assert the same falsehoods that led us into Iraq and keeps us there. 

<p>"Instead of campaign style speeches, the President's time would be better spent, doing what a majority of the American people want him to do, planning to bring our troops home and ending the war in Iraq."
