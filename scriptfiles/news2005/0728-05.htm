<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 27 - Peace Action applauded U.S. Army Gen. George W. Casey, head of Multinational Force Iraq today for stating that the U.S. could bring home a &#147;fairly substantial&#148; number of the 135,000 U.S. troops in Iraq beginning as early as next spring. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, confirmed at a joint news conference with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that it is time to send U.S. troops home by stating, &#147;we desire speed in that regard.&#148; </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;President Bush stated that he would bring U.S. troops home when the Iraqi government asked Washington to do so. The Iraqi Prime Minister, over 120 Iraqi Parliamentarians*, Republican congressmen and the American people are asking for a plan to bring U.S. troops home as soon as possible. When will President Bush provide a plan?&#148; asked Paul Kawika Martin, Organizing and Political Director for Peace Action. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives Neil Abercrombie (D-HI) and Walter B. Jones, Jr. (R-NC) introduced &#147;Homeward Bound&#148; H. J. RES. 55 calling for the Bush Administration to provide an exit plan by the end of this year and to start implementing that plan no later than October 2006. Several Republicans have signed on to this bipartisan resolution including Representatives Wayne T. Gilchrest (MD), James A. Leach (IA) and Ron Paul (TX). </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Not only do we need a plan to bring our troops home, we need to leave no permanent bases and work with the international community to help the Iraqi people rebuild their country that the U.S. devastated,&#148; remarked Jon Rainwater, the Executive Director of California Peace Action, which has over 30,000 members in California. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action is the United States' largest peace and disarmament organization with over 100,000 members nationwide and nearly 100 chapters in thirty states.</font></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
