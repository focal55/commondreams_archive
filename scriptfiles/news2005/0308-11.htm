<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 8 -- NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation&#146;s leading advocate for personal privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose, said Americans are outraged that the Senate voted today to protect offenders convicted of violent acts against women&#146;s clinics.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On a vote of 53-46, the Senate voted down an amendment to bankruptcy legislation sponsored by Sens. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Harry Reid (D-NV). The Schumer-Reid amendment would have prevented individuals convicted of violent acts against women&#146;s health clinics, patients, and doctors from evading punishment by claiming bankruptcy in order to avoid paying court ordered fines.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nancy Keenan, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said: &quot;This amendment should have passed unanimously &#150; even people who oppose a woman&#146;s right to choose should be outraged at violent criminals who use bombings, murder threats, vandalism and other such tactics, and appalled at them evading punishment by declaring bankruptcy. It&#146;s a simple issue of law and order. But the hardline far-right lobby holds more sway than the American people in Washington today. When the far right says &#145;jump&#146; this Senate asks &#145;how high?&#146; &quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The need for the Schumer-Reid clinic-violence provision is clear. Since 1993, three doctors, two clinic employees, a clinic escort, and a security guard have been murdered. In addition to these seven murders, seventeen attempted murders have also occurred since 1991. Two of these murders, as well as one attempted murder, occurred in 1998. Since then, one attempted murder, two bombings, 18 incidents of arson, 298 acts of vandalism, 642 anthrax threats, 121 bomb threats, and 27 blockades have occurred at clinics.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Keenan added: &quot;We&#146;re grateful to Senators Schumer and Reid for taking this commonsense stand &#150; and thankful for the 46 senators who resisted political pressure and sided with the American majority.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
