<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - "The FDA's continued contempt for women's health is astounding," 
            said NOW president Kim Gandy after Tuesday's announcement that the 
            agency had issued yet another "approvable" letter for risky <A 
            href="http://www.now.org/issues/health/implants/">silicone breast 
            implants</A>, this time to Inamed Corporation. 
<P>"This move by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is 
            charged with safeguarding our health and safety, is just the latest 
            example of the agency's willingness to trade off public health for 
            Bush administration priorities. Recently FDA granted preliminary 
            approval to Mentor Corporation's similarly risky silicone gel-filled 
            breast implant despite grossly insufficient safety data, and earlier 
            this month the agency revealed it would continue stalling over 
            approval of over-the-counter sales of emergency contraception. Any 
            pretense of sound, scientific decision-making has disappeared from 
            public view. </P>
            <P>"Whether it's Vioxx or Bextra or silicone implants, the rule now 
            is 'Buyer Beware,'" said Gandy. "The drug and device companies own 
            the FDA and it is the companies' profit potential that rules the 
            review and approval process - except when the profit motive is 
            overridden by the White House morality police, as with the 
            morning-after pill." </P>
            <P>Though the approvable letter is not a final go-ahead for 
            Inamed-and the same holds for a previous notice sent to Mentor 
            Corporation-the process has taken this unfortunate step toward 
            general marketing of a device which has not been demonstrated safe 
            over the long term. In its news release about the Inamed approvable 
            letter, the FDA stated that certain conditions still had to be met 
            by the company-but declined to make those stipulations public. </P>
            <P>The Food and Drug Administration's own scientific staff stated 
            unequivocally at the advisory panel meetings in April that data 
            submitted by both implant manufacturers did not demonstrate 
            long-term safety. In January 2004 the FDA rejected a previous Inamed 
            request to market its silicone breast implant and asked them for 
            long-term data on the safety question. </P>
            <P>There are indications that the breast implant makers are being 
            asked to require women who receive implants be closely monitored and 
            undergo frequent MRI exams to determine where the implant is 
            ruptured and leaking. In the past, both companies have demonstrated 
            a low commitment to monitoring breast implant patients and there is 
            evidence that women who have attempted to report complications have 
            been ignored.</P>
            <P>Gandy noted that breast implants often rupture after 10 to 12 
            years of wear and because silicone leaks slowly and silently into 
            the lymph nodes, brain and major organs through the blood stream, 
            women need to be aware of the long-term health risks. Silicone gel 
            contains toxic substances such as platinum and National Cancer 
            Institute studies (2001) have shown higher rates of brain and lung 
            cancer among women with implants (both silicone and saline 
            implants). </P>
            <P>In addition, there is the problem of insufficient studies about 
            implants and autoimmune diseases such as fibromyalgia, lupus and 
            rheumatoid arthritis that need to be addressed. These types of 
            illnesses are commonly reported by women who have received breast 
            implants. </P>
            <P>Further, re-operation is often required because of infections, 
            hardening of tissues around the implants, migration of the implant, 
            rupture and other complications. One Canadian study found that more 
            than half of the women with implants needed a subsequent operation, 
            while 23 percent had undergone two operations and 17 percent had 
            four or more additional surgeries. Re-operation rates among 
            mastectomy patients with implants are very high as well. Insurance 
            usually does not cover re-operation costs related to breast 
            augmentation and companies often deny coverage to any illness or 
            injuries that could be related to implants. </P>
            
<P>"Most studies submitted to the FDA have been conducted by the 
            manufacturers of implants who obviously have a vested interested and 
            whose findings are frequently biased and misleading," Gandy added. 
            "We must reform this heavy reliance on industry, which interferes 
            with sound scientific decision-making by the FDA."</P>
