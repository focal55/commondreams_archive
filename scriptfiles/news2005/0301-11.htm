<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 1 -- Thursday, a key Senate Committee will take up legislation with profound implications for America's clean air. The Bush administration and Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) Chairman James Inhofe have made it very clear that they would like to replace the current Clean Air Act with something more favorable to big energy companies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, the public learned just how far Senator Inhofe is willing to go to help polluters when several reports revealed that the Oklahoma Senator requested tax records from the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials and the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators.  Both highly respected organizations had testified against the bill proposed by Senator Inhofe and the Bush administration.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to Thursdays scheduled mark up by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the Sierra Club issued the following statement:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The existing Clean Air Act is one of the most successful public health protections in U.S. history.  However, it is no secret that the Bush administration and Senator Inhofe want to rewrite air pollution protections to favor big energy companies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The radical plan being considered would allow 2-3 times more soot, smog and mercury pollution than strong enforcement of the current law - and delay cleanup for a decade longer.  Additionally, it lets unseen market forces - rather than universal public health standards - decide whether communities will get any relief from dirty air.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are very concerned that Senator Inhofe has resorted to intimidation of respected organizations that oppose his plan.  Not only should the Environment and Public Works Committee reject Inhofe's radical assault on clean air, but it should also send a strong message that these tactics will not be tolerated.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The best way to achieve the clean air standards that Americans want and deserve continues to be the strong enforcement of the Clean Air Act. Members of the Environment and Public Works Committee would be wise to take the long view when casting their votes, and ask themselves 'Is it better to move forward with an existing program with a track record of success than open the door to a high risk scheme?'</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Thirty years of clean air progress shows that enforcing the Clean Air Act protects public health. It makes no sense to turn our back on success.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: Nat Mund is available for comment on tomorrow's mark up. Please call Brian O'Malley at 202-675-6279 to schedule an interview.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
