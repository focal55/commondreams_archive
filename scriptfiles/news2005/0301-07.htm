<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 1 --  The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) today welcomed the U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawing the execution of juvenile offenders, a ruling that conforms with public opinion at home and international human rights norms abroad.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This decision confirms what we all know and what science recently has proven: kids are different,&quot; said Tonya McClary, AFSC national criminal justice representative. &quot;Kids are different from adults and by their very nature cannot qualify as the 'worst of the worst' standard used by some to justify a sentence of death.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McClary noted that a historically broad coalition of national civil rights groups, religious denominations, legal organizations and medical associations had urged the court to strike down the juvenile death penalty. Late last year, the Service Committee, along with a coalition of religious groups, filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of executing minors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, polls demonstrate solid public opposition against the practice.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We applaud the fact that the court recognized the strong consensus against the juvenile death penalty,&quot; McClary said. &quot;This consensus is further evidence that the U.S. public does not want the death penalty applied too broadly. We also hope that this brings us one step closer to eliminating the death penalty overall.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In keeping with Quaker beliefs, AFSC maintains that every person has value in the eyes of God and that human life is sacred. Therefore, taking the life of another human being is never justified. Furthermore, we recognize the special consideration that should be given children. They can not be held to the same standard of culpability as adults and have immense potential for change and rehabilitation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Including Missouri, from which Roper v. Simmons sprang, 31 states ban the execution of juvenile offenders. Of the remaining states, only 12 have juvenile offenders on death row. They are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. Currently there are two juvenile offenders on Pennsylvania's death row. To read more about the juvenile death penalty and learn about a coalitional campaign to end juvenile executions, please visit http://www.ncadp.org/juvenile_action.html</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the past two decades, 22 juvenile offender executions have occurred in the United States, including 13 in the state of Texas. Nine such executions have occurred since the year 2000. Six of those nine took place in Texas and involved an African American offender. The other three executions took place in Oklahoma and Virginia. More than half of the juvenile offenders on death row are housed in two states - Alabama and Texas - and about two-thirds are people of color.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today the United States takes a major step toward joining the 21st Century,&quot; McClary said. &quot;The U.S. Supreme Court has confirmed that standards of decency have evolved and the execution of youthful offenders is indeed a cruel and unusual practice. Today the Court sends a signal to the few states that still execute juvenile offenders that this inhumane practice is no longer an option.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Friends Service Committee Criminal Justice program works nationwide to eliminate the use of prisons, jails, and executions as a &quot;solution&quot; to crime and violence. The group challenges the morality and effectiveness of the &quot;get-tough-on-crime&quot; mentality. It believes taking the life of another human being is never justified. A main focus of the work has been through the Religious Organizing Against the Death Penalty Project (www.deathpenaltyreligious.org), which has galvanized and organized the religious community to be vocal and visible in the struggle for abolition.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Service Committee has been integrally involved in legislative efforts against the death penalty in a number of states, including New Hampshire, South Dakota, and Wyoming.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
