<p> AMSTERDAM - December 8 - Communities living on 
the fenceline of Shell's operations from around the world met today with 
Shell CEO Van de Veer to ask for concrete commitments to solve their 
serious environmental and health problems.

<p>Van de Veer agreed to a direct line of communication from the fenceline 
communities to the highest level of decision making within Royal Dutch 
Shell. However, Van der Veer did not want to take ultimate 
responsibility for the operations of his local facilities, which is a 
matter of concern to the fenceline groups.

<p>Shell admitted that stakeholder dialogue must be improved and that 
monitoring of emissions can be done better, but claims that it cannot 
prescribe or dictate specific improvements to local plant managers. 
Shell refused to agree upon criteria for the engagement of community 
groups on environmental issues.

<p>Before the company's AGM in April 2006, the groups will report to Shell 
and the public what progress has been made on these issues. The groups 
will continue to campaign locally and globally to stop the company's 
wrongdoings. Shell will be expected to deliver on its promises, 
particularly in projects under development where crucial construction 
decisions will be made, such as those in County Mayo, Ireland and 
Sakhalin Island.

<p>"Shell talks about its philosophies, but philosophy doesn't fix 
pipelines and it doesn't cure pollution-related illness" says Norbert 
George from Curacao. "The ball is in Shell's court to show that they 
live up to their standards, and this should be demonstrated by concrete 
actions."

<p>"Shell's double standards have been well documented," said Desmond D'sa 
from Durban, South Africa. "They use cleaner and safer technologies at 
the Shell refinery in Denmark than they do in Durban, for example."__

<p>Shell's management agreed to a direct line of communication for 
fenceline neighbors to the CEO, and also agreed to consider the 
installation of real time fenceline air monitoring at their refineries. 
However, the company declined to agree to the following requests: 
objective criteria for engaging appropriate stakeholders on 
environmental issues (denied); expedited timeline for upgrading aging 
equipment in developing countries (denied); a joint process to determine 
responsibility for contamination from operations (denied); and the 
erasure of double standards in their operations in developed nations 
versus developing nations (disagreement upon the facts).__

<p>The delegation from Shell consisted of high-level senior managers. From 
the fenceline communities, there were representatives from Nigeria, 
South Africa, Curacao, Texas and Brazil. Shell's operations have been a 
concern of the global alliance of fenceline communities for three years, 
and affected groups have issued numerous reports documenting Shell's 
poor performance.
