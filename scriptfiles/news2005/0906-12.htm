<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - September 6 - On the eve of the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Judge John Roberts, a new group has formed in Maine to challenge and expose the extremist views of the far right.

 

<p>Democracy Now, Inc. began running ads today in Maine newspapers, including the Portland Press Herald, announcing its formation and asking Maine people to join them in exposing the harmful and often hypocritical agenda of the far right. They have also launched a website at www.mainedemocracynow.org.

 

<p>Formed by Portland businessman Robert CS Monks, attorney Anthony Buxton and political activist Jacqueline Potter, Democracy Now, Inc. aims to raise substantial funds to counter what it calls “the far right’s magnificent exercise in political camouflage.” It has hired full-time staff to begin raising funds and launch a direct-mail campaign to Maine voters.

 

<p>“The far right has used many ways to dress up its extremist agenda,” said Monks. “They eliminate air quality laws and call it the ‘Clear Skies Initiative.’ They confiscate civil rights in the name of ‘liberty.’ They say they want government off our backs, but don’t think twice about marching it right into your bedroom.

 

<p>“What’s been missing in Maine,” Monks continued, “is a serious effort to expose the tactics and strategy of the far right and all those who enable and support it. Our goal is to shine a spotlight on this small, largely unknown group of fabulously wealthy conservatives who seek to turn our public policies back a century or more. Democracy Now, Inc. will provide a voice for Maine citizens who believe as we do that the far right has too much influence and too little accountability.”

 

<p>The nomination of John Roberts is the latest example of how the far right tries to disguise its extremist agenda, Monks said. “Roberts is being presented as a reasonable guy, a handsome family man,” he said. “But his record shows that he a long-time opponent to many of our most important Constitutional rights and democratic institutions.”

 

<p>The group’s ads began running Tuesday in several Maine newspapers. They show a picture of Roberts with the headline, “Meet the Latest Face of Extremism.” It urges the public to contact Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and tell them that a vote to confirm Roberts is a vote to condone extremism. 

 

<p>Future ads will deal with other issues, such as the failure of the far right to provide for the economic and military security of the US, the far right’s efforts to paralyze America’s state governments, including Maine’s; and the ongoing attempt to politicize National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System.
