<p>MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin - December 7 - US Senator Russ Feingold announced today the beginning of an internet event called “Pick a Progressive Patriot,” an online vote to determine who Feingold will financially support next through his leadership committee, the Progressive Patriots Fund.  Feingold has selected eleven Congressional challengers from nominations received on his website, <a href="http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com">www.progressivepatriotsfund.com</a>. The candidate who receives the most votes by midnight on December 14th will receive a $5,000 contribution from the Progressive Patriots Fund.

 

<p>“I am committed to the effort of building the Democratic Party throughout America and I am particularly pleased to offer this opportunity for the grassroots to make their voice heard,” Feingold said. “These are eleven great candidates, and I have high hopes for all of them next November."

 

<p>Voting will take place on the Progressive Patriots Fund website, www.progressivepatriotsfund.com, from December 5th through December 14th.

 

<p>The candidates competing in this event are Francine Busby (CA-50), Chris Carney (PA-10), John Courage (TX-21), Brad Ellsworth (IN-08), Nick Lampson (TX-22), Patricia Madrid (NM-01), Lois Murphy (PA-06), Coleen Rowley (MN-02), Heath Shuler (NC-11), Tim Walz (MN-01), and Peter Welch (VT-AL).

 

<p>In 2004 Feingold was re-elected to his third term as United States Senator from Wisconsin with an 11 point victory, receiving more votes than any other candidate in the state’s history.

 

<p>Feingold formed the Progressive Patriots Fund to promote a progressive reform agenda and support candidates across the country. The organization’s website, www.progressivepatriotsfund.com, encourages citizen activism and currently calls for citizen co-sponsors of Feingold’s efforts to reform the USA PATRIOT Act.
