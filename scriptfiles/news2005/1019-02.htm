<p>CHERBOURG - The danger and secrecy of the French 
nuclear industry has been further exposed by plans for an emergency 
exercise at the la Hague plutonium plant, Greenpeace stated today.

<p>The exercise is due to be conducted by the plant operators, Areva, and 
the authorities on Thursday 20 October (1). However, results of a new 
analysis commissioned by Greenpeace show that in the event of deliberate 
armed attack hazardous radioactive material including plutonium and 
high-level nuclear waste fission products would be dispersed over a wide 
area, outside the area to be evacuated by French authorities. 

<p>Simultaneously, plans by the French Government to hold public 
consultations on Electricite de France's (EdF) new European Pressurized 
Water reactor (EPR) before authorizing construction are in disarray. The 
Government appointed Commission established to coordinate the debate, 
has been informed by the office of the Prime Minister that significant 
information related to nuclear safety and security of the new large 
reactor will not be made public (2).

<p>"These two events demonstrate the reality of nuclear power in France. An 
emergency exercise motivated by public relations rather than real-case 
scenarios and concern for public safety, and a determination by the 
Government and EdF to block public debate on vital nuclear safety and 
security issues - nuclear power and democracy are not compatible," said 
Yannick Rousselet of Greenpeace France.  

<p>Ahead of the Areva exercise, Greenpeace International engaged Large & 
Associates to conduct a brief assessment (3) of what an armed terrorist 
group could do once it had obtained access to the la Hague complex.

<p>Of the three scenarios assessed in all cases radioactive releases extend 
the need for active counter-measures, such as sheltering and evacuation, 
beyond the immediate locality of la Hague, with the plutonium and HLW 
releases requiring evacuation of Cherbourg and beyond. In one of the 
scenario's evacuation would be required to as far out as 100km from la 
Hague due to the high radiation dose expected (4).

<p>Dr John Large from Large & Associates commented: "on the information 
that I have received, the Areva exercise considerably underplays the 
seriousness and severity of the impact of a terrorist attack. A real 
exercise would test the emergency services and the effectiveness of 
countermeasures; this contrived exercise will not." 

<p>"Claims that nuclear power has a future defy the reality of the security 
and safety risks posed by reactors and the nuclear waste and plutonium 
they produce. The French government and EdF (and Areva) may be trying to 
impose new facilities on the French people, but its clear that existing 
plants already threaten public health and the environment far beyond 
French territory," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International.  

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative communications tools to put the spotlight on 
global environmental problems, and drives towards solutions essential 
for a green and peaceful future.

<p>Notes to editors

<p>1. Greenpeace understands the exercise to be conducted at la Hague will 
involve between 800 and 900 children and students from a local nursery, 
school and college. After being kept inside, they will be evacuated. A 
smaller number around 100-200 will be involved all day. French naval 
forces will also take part, possibly to assist in evacuation.

<p>2. The French nuclear secrecy decree issued in 2003 is one reason why 
information is not to be made available to independent scientific 
experts, environmental NGOs and the general public. The panel of experts 
resigned en masse on Monday 16 October 2005 citing information 
restrictions. 

<p>3. Analysis conducted by consulting nuclear engineers Large and 
Associates looked at three scenarios:
* an attack on an irradiated fuel flask waiting to be processed into the 
storage  ponds;
* the dispersion of a few kilograms of the 55 tonnes of  plutonium 
dioxide currently stored at la Hague;
* the rupturing and release from a single high level liquor waste tank. The analysis, including computer generated dispersal models, are 
available at www.largeassociates.com/la_hague_terrorist_exercise.htm

<p>4. More catastrophic scenarios not in latest this assessment would 
include passenger aircraft impact on la Hague. In 2002, the Government 
deployed anti-aircraft missile systems around la Hague.*
