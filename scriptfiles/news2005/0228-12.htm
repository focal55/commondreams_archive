<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 28 -- In an unprecedented move, the US Human Rights Network, a network of more than 160 US-based human rights organizations, today issued a memorandum to President George Bush decrying the current state of human rights in the US, as the US State Department released its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is the height of hypocrisy for the US government to issue a report condemning human rights abuses in other countries at a time when it is violating these very same standards at home and abroad,&#148; said Ajamu Baraka, Executive Director of the US Human Rights Network (USHRN). </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US State Department says that &#145;&#133;the central goal of US foreign policy has been the promotion of respect for human rights&#146; and that the United States &#145;seeks to hold governments accountable to their obligations under universal human rights norms and international human rights instruments. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;But who is holding the US to account to those very same obligations?&#148; asked Baraka.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">USHRN members are monitoring US human rights practice in a whole range of areas &#150; from employment rights to torture, from discrimination to housing rights, from poverty and homelessness to abuses arising from the &#147;war on terror&#148; &#150; and have found that not only is the US falling very far short of its obligations in all of these areas &#150; it is actually practicing itself what it condemns in other countries.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is not a partisan political attack on President Bush,&#148; said Baraka, who noted that the more than 160 organizations affiliated with this Network span the political spectrum and are based throughout the country. &#147;Their only interest is with the human rights of US citizens and residents and any others affected by US actions internationally &#150; including as a result of current attempts by the federal government to legitimize the use of torture and ill-treatment against foreigners abroad in complete violation of international law, which explicitly prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment under any circumstances.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are concerned that the behavior of the US government both domestically and internationally is bringing this nation into disrepute around the world &#150; and this reflects on all of us as Americans,&#148; said Baraka.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Good human rights practice begins at home,&#148; added Baraka. &#147;Violations of human rights by the US government has not only created a climate of fear and repression at home &#150; it has also provided fodder for those around the world who seek to undermine or ignore any legitimate calls for human rights that the US government may make &#150; with US government representatives becoming an object of derision at international forums where human rights are discussed.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US Human Rights Network plans to follow up today&#146;s memorandum with a detailed Human Rights Agenda for the Bush Administration, in which it will outline the main areas of human rights concern in the US, the government&#146;s international obligations with regard to these areas, and clear recommendations on how the administration can address the serious shortfall between the two.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
