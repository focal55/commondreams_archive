<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 13 -- Today the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), in partnership with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), is participating in a national effort to recognize the abduction of AMBER Hagerman, the 9-year-old girl whose 1996 abduction and murder prompted the creation of the AMBER Alert program. NCMEC and DOJ are encouraging all participants in the AMBER (America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response) Alert program across the country to remember this day by increasing public awareness about this life- saving program.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The AMBER Alert program shows that each and every one of us has an important role to play in the search for abducted children,&quot; said Ernie Allen, NCMEC President and CEO. &quot;Amber's legacy will live on through the 188 children whose lives have been saved by the AMBER Alert program.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an effort to promote public education of the AMBER Alert program, DOJ has produced three public service announcements (PSA). Ed Smart, father of Elizabeth Smart who was abducted and successfully recovered in 2003, and John Walsh, host of America's Most Wanted and co-founder of NCMEC, narrate the PSAs. These PSAs can be found on the national AMBER Alert web site <a href="http://www.amberalert.gov/" target="_new">http://www.amberalert.gov</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to Amber's abduction, the Dallas/Fort Worth Association of Radio Managers teamed up with local law- enforcement in 1997 to implement the first local AMBER Plan. Since that time, the program has grown into a seamless network of over 100 AMBER Plans across the country, and has even reached into Canada and parts of England. To date, the AMBER Alert program has been credited with the safe recovery of over 180 children.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMBER Alerts are emergency messages broadcast primarily via radio and television, and in some areas post on electronic highway signs, when law enforcement determines that a child has been abducted and is in imminent danger. The broadcasts include information about the child, the abductor, such as physical descriptions, as well as information about the abductor's vehicle, which could lead to the child's recovery and the apprehension of the suspect.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children:</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NCMEC is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that works in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. NCMEC's congressionally mandated CyberTipline, a reporting mechanism for child sexual exploitation, has handled more than 273,000 leads. Since its establishment in 1984, NCMEC has assisted law enforcement with more than 102,000 missing child cases, resulting in the recovery of more than 87,000 children.</font> </i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
