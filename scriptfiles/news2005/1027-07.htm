<p>WASHINGTON - The House has slipped an 
amendment into the Patriot Act Reauthorization Act that would 
dramatically skew federal death penalty cases in favor of the 
prosecution, Human Rights Watch said today. 

<p>The legislation would radically increase the number of federal crimes 
drawing the death penalty, allow judges to reduce juries deciding the 
death penalty to fewer than twelve persons, and allow the prosecutor to 
start afresh in trying to get the death penalty with a new sentencing 
jury any time even one juror resists imposing the death penalty in a 
capital case.   
  
<p>Under current federal law, the defendant is given a life sentence if a 
jury of twelve does not unanimously vote for the death penalty. Under 
this legislation, the prosecutor could re-impanel a new jury and try for 
death once again.   
  
<p>"It's a strange notion of justice indeed to give prosecutors multiple 
bites at the apple," said Jamie Fellner, U.S. Director of Human Rights 
Watch. "Death penalty cases are already riddled with unfairness. Why 
would Congress want to make them worse?"   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch said that the legislation would give dramatic 
power to a single juror who could hold out for the death penalty – and 
thus enable the prosecution to secure a new jury. Juries in death 
penalty cases are already "death-qualified," meaning that anyone who 
opposes the death penalty on moral, religious, or practical grounds is 
excluded from the jury. Yet another legislative provision passed by the 
House would tilt the trial in favor of death even further by permitting 
the judge to reduce the number of jurors below twelve, with no 
minimum number set. A smaller jury would make it even easier for 
prosecutors to secure a unanimous verdict in favor of death.   
  
<p>The House provisions would also triple the number of death penalty- eligible terrorism related crimes and allow the government to impose 
the death penalty even if the defendant had no knowledge or intent to 
kill. Under this legislation, an individual could be sentenced to death 
for providing financial support to a designated terrorist organization 
whose members caused the death of another, even if this individual did 
not know or in any way intend that the members engage in any 
specific acts of violence.   
  
<p>Rep. John Carter (R- Tex.) introduced these death penalty provisions 
as last minute amendments to the House version of the Patriot Act 
Reauthorization Act. They were passed by voice vote, without debate. 
The Patriot Act Reauthorization Act passed by the Senate contains 
none of these death penalty provisions. A final version of the 
legislation is expected to emerge from conference with the Senate in 
the next one to two weeks and go to the floor of both the House and 
Senate for an up or down vote.   
  
<p>"These provisions dramatically extend the reach of the federal death 
penalty and make it significantly easier for the prosecution to secure 
death, an inherently cruel penalty," said Jennifer Daskal, U.S. Program 
Advocate at Human Rights Watch. "Such a radical change to the 
federal death penalty should not become law without public debate."   
  
<p>The key provisions are in Title II of H.R. 3199. Section 231 (f) allows 
for the impaneling of consecutive juries in the penalty phase of a death 
penalty trial, and Sections 211 and 214 together add a long list of new 
federal death penalty eligible crimes that do not carry the intent 
requirement laid out in 18 U.S.C. § 3591(b).   
  
<p>The Senate version of the Patriot Act Reauthorization (S.1389) does 
not include these provisions.   
  
<p>House and Senate negotiators have begun to meet to iron out the 
differences in the two bills. A final version will be voted on by named 
conferees and then sent back to the House and Senate for an up or 
down vote.   
  
<p>Senate conferees are Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Mike DeWine (R-OH), Orrin 
Hatch (R-UT), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Carl 
Levin (D-MI), Pat Roberts (R-KS), John Rockefeller (D-WV), Jeff 
Sessions (R-AL), Arlen Specter (R-PA).   
  
<p>House conferees have not yet been named.
