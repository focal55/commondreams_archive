Juhasz wrote the recent piece "<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-juhasz14aug14,0,11886.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">Bush's Economic Invasion of Iraq</a>" for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, in which she stated: "What hasn't been on the table [in the constitution process] is at least as important to the formation of a new Iraq: the country's economic structure. The Bush administration has succeeded in maintaining a stranglehold on issues such as public versus private ownership of resources, foreign access to Iraqi oil and U.S. control of the reconstruction effort -- all of which are still governed by administration policies put into place immediately after the invasion. The Bush economic agenda favors foreign interests -- American interests -- over Iraqi self-determination." <br>

Juhasz is a Foreign Policy In Focus scholar and the author of the forthcoming book <i>The Bush Agenda: Invading the World, One Economy at a Time</i>.<br />
