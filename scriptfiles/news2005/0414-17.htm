<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 14 -- MoveOn PAC kicked off a new campaign this week to oppose the Republican-led effort to pass a bankruptcy law that would hurt middle class families. The bankruptcy bill is the latest in a series of Republican initiatives to benefit corporate special interests and the super-rich at the expense of hardworking Americans.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its new campaign, announced in an email to members, MoveOn PAC will target radio ads against House members &#150; Democrats as well as Republicans &#150; who vote today to support new bankruptcy legislation.  More than half a million dollars have been pledged by MoveOn members.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;With solid control of both houses of Congress and the White House, the Republican  leadership thinks they&#146;re free to show their true colors &#150; taking from the middle class and giving to the wealthy and corporations,&#148; said Tom Matzzie, MoveOn PAC&#146;s Washington Director. &#147;But we&#146;re going to call the Republican agenda what it truly is: a war on the middle class.  Every time the Republicans do something that harms working families to benefit corporate special interests, we&#146;ll be there to let voters know what their representatives are really up to.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next stages in the Republican war on the middle class will be Congressional votes later in the week to permanently repeal the estate tax that benefits only the nation&#146;s wealthiest one percent and later this month on a budget that cuts vital health and other services to working families, while exploding the national debt.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This isn&#146;t about only one piece of legislation,&#148; added Matzzie.  &#147;This is about helping America&#146;s middle class understand the full danger that radical Republicans pose to their personal finances and well-being.  The American people deserve to know who&#146;s on their side and who&#146;s trying to harm them for the sake of banks and other credit card companies.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MoveOn PAC&#146;s email this week announced the creation of a pledge drive to raise funds for the radio ads.  The ads will start running immediately after the vote and will identify specifically how much money the individual members who vote for the bill received from the lending industry and how the bill hurts working families.   Exact details of the buy will be announced later in the week.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
