<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 18 -- On Saturday, several thousand protestors will rally outside Fort Bragg, North Carolina to mark the 2nd anniversary of the Iraq war.  But at least one respected peace organization will not be there. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The national protest organized this weekend by United For Peace And Justice (UFPJ) is not about ending the war in Iraq, it's about pulling U.S. forces and abandoning the Iraqi people, &quot; says Erik Gustafson, the executive director of the Education for Peace in Iraq Center (EPIC). </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded in 1998 by human rights advocates, EPIC promotes peace, human rights, and democracy for the people of Iraq.  Since the March 2003 invasion of Iraq two years ago this week, EPIC has advocated U.S. and international assistance of Iraqi-led nation-building and opposes the withdrawal of UN-sanctioned forces until Iraq is able to provide for its own security.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;An immediate US withdrawal from Iraq is not a responsible action. The only way out of Iraq is through nation building,&quot; explains EPIC's director, who is also a U.S. Army veteran of the 1991 Gulf War. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraqi-Americans and veterans groups have joined EPIC in questioning the wisdom of rallies that call for a quick withdrawal. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Iraqi population, who suffered through multiple wars and years of sanctions, cannot be abandoned to a small and violent minority which makes targets of children and civilians.  Though we believe further changes are needed in our strategy in Iraq, leaving without stabilizing Iraq is not an option,&quot; said Charles Sheehan-Miles, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense and a 1991 Gulf War veteran.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other veterans groups which question the conduct of the war have also criticized the protests.  In a press statement issued yesterday, Operation Truth (an Iraq War veterans' organization, <a href="http://www.optruth.org/" target="_new">http://www.optruth.org</a>) said that by protesting in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the anti-war groups were blaming the troops for policy set in Washington.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following individuals are available for comment to the media:</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ala Fik, Iraqi-American activist for peace and democracy based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
