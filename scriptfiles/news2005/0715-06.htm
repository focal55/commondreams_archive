<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 15 - Governors from the Midwest, West, and Northeast today urged President Bush to lead a national project to achieve energy independence within a decade in an open letter to the White House. The letter was released the day after the long-awaited members of the complete House-Senate energy bill conference were named. Lawmakers are under pressure to send the president an energy bill before the congressional recess in August because of soaring gasoline prices.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The signatories believe that the nation's security and energy needs provide a mandate to rejuvenate our nation's economy. In the letter, seven governors pushed for creating a new generation of American jobs, as advocated by the Apollo Alliance, a new coalition of national security, labor, environmental, civil rights and business leaders who are fighting for energy independence from foreign energy sources.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;America needs to think big, and rise to our potential by tapping the can-do spirit core to our shared history,&quot; said Gov. Christine Gregoire, D-Wash. &quot;In Washington state we are working to create alternative energy solutions to meet future needs, and we encourage support for similar measures at the federal level.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gov. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., noted that both the House and Senate versions of the energy bill do little to stop rising gas prices.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We need an energy bill that delivers relief to everyday people who work hard to make ends meet,&quot; said Blagojevich.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to Gregoire and Blagojevich, signatories included Governors Jim Doyle, D-Wis.; Ted Kulongoski,, D-Ore.; Janet Napolitano, D-Ariz.; Bill Richardson,, D-N.M.; and Brian Schweitzer, D-Mont., who all noted that energy efficiency policies have already been implemented in their states and urged President Bush to extend them to the federal level.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
