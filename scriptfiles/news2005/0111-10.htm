<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DALLAS, TX -- January 11 -- Recently, the Michigan legislature passed bills that will greatly increase the collection powers of the Michigan child support agency. KRightsRadio says this is not a good development for families based on reports like the following:</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michigan father Terrance Hale had almost $3000 garnished from his paycheck for child support over a period of 3 years. Odd thing is, it's all a mistake because someone at the child support agency &quot;misprinted&quot; his name on a child support order. Hale says he doesn't even know the mother or the child he's been forced to financially support.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hale has been trying for 3 years to get this error fixed, with no success.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's no way what they did was fair,&quot; said Hale, speaking of the child support agencies' actions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially, the child support agency, the Wayne County Friend of the Court (FOC), said it would dismiss the case and return Hale's money to him. Now, Marilyn Stephen, director of the Michigan Office of Child Support, says that the child support agency gave away Hale's &quot;child support&quot; money to support the child. The state says Hale will have to get a lawyer and collect his $3000 from the woman who received his money.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is like a robber saying to the robbery victim who's demanding his money back, 'Too bad. I gave the $3000 that I just stole from you to a child. You'll have to get it back from the parent.' This wouldn't happen, and the child support agency should be held accountable -- just like a bank would -- for returning Hale's money and correcting this egregious mistake,&quot; said Richar' Farr, founder of KRightsRadio.com.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KRightsRadio.com believes that these kinds of errors and questionable practices happen in agencies nationwide. Furthermore, Marilyn Stephen shouldn't be surprised since it's not the first time she's had to deal with child support agency errors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a Feb. 16, 2004 article in The Jackson Citizen Patriot about child support agency problems:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;...The latest problem followed the state's move to impose a 25-cent per case fee that would go to the Attorney General's Office. The change caused the statewide computer system to change clients' income withholding orders automatically, in some cases by amounts that had no obvious explanation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 80,000 withholding orders that were affected statewide, about half contained errors, said Marilyn Stephen, a Jackson resident who directs the Office of Child Support for the Family Independence Agency...&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an outrage. That's 40,000 cases that they admitted had errors. Have these errors been corrected? As suggested by the Lansing State Journal on December 7, 2003, we agree that it's time for a federal investigation of the child support computer system. It's long overdue, and this is evidence of it. Too many families are suffering due to agency mistakes. In this case, the U.S. taxpayers are paying for the agency to collect from the wrong man. I believe this kind of overzealousness and unaccountability on the part of child support enforcement is hurting Michigan children and families, not helping,&quot; said Farr.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KRightsRadio believes all citizens are vulnerable to child support agency errors when the system is in such disarray, as evidenced by numerous news reports.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a violation of citizens' fundamental rights to property and due process guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. While they are at it, investigators should also look at why Michigan is reportedly holding millions of dollars in collected undistributed child support money. This is the children's money, and it's not reaching them. Why not? How can the FOC, in good faith, use this bad data and a system in this much disarray to arrest and intimidate alleged nonpayers of child support? How does this help children? It clearly doesn't,&quot; said Farr. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About KRightsRadio.com:</i></font><i><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Fathers, Mothers, their Children, Grand Parents and extended families anguish under the grave hand of Anti-Family Agendas, Dedicated Fathers and Non-Custodial Parents have sought to be heard on the issues of the tragic injustices routinely committed behind the darkened doors of the &quot;Family Court System.&quot; August 1, 2004 marked the birth of a voice that will amplify The Regional Murmurs of Sincere Hearts into a National Debate for Change to Public Policy &#151; A Debate that will demand real change to a system of Laws and Attitudes that devours and destroys the lives of good people.Starting on that day, and continuing for 24 hours a day, 7 days and nights a week, 365 days a year, the KRightsRadio NETWORK will begin broadcasting to every home and heart in our nation the truth to protect and ensure the absolute rights of parents and their children .
