<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DENVER -- April 27 -- Representatives from Ghana, Indonesia, Peru, Romania, and Nevada today called on Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold producer, to urgently reform its human rights and environmental practices at its global operations. Speaking at the company's annual shareholders meeting, representatives demanded that Newmont fully respect human rights, stop intimidation of farmers, community members and individuals critical of its operations, and stop dumping mine wastes into the ocean. They also called on the company to permanently cancel plans for new, open-pit mines on densely populated farmland in Romania, in a Ghanaian forest reserve, and on a mountain in Peru that is a source of community drinking water.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Although we come from five different continents, we share many similar experiences with Newmont's operations. We also share similar demands: we ask that the company stop polluting our oceans and freshwater with mining waste, stay out of our protected forests, and that it only mine with the informed consent of communities,&quot; said Daniel Owusu-Koranteng of Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining (WACAM) in Ghana.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Newmont is facing multi-million dollar lawsuits in Indonesia and Peru. Community protests in Peru nearly forced the closing of the company's most profitable mine, Yanacocha, in September 2004. In 2003, The World Bank declined to finance a proposed mine in Romania in which Newmont recently invested -- a mine that the European Parliament has said could cost Romania entry into the European Union.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The visiting representatives also criticized Newmont for intimidation of its critics, including filing a defamation lawsuit against an Indonesian professor, Dr. Rignolda Djamaluddin, who spoke publicly about Newmont's practice of dumping mine waste in Buyat Bay. &quot;I am here because Dr. Rignolda cannot be here as a result of this lawsuit that is meant to intimidate us and stifle our voice,&quot; said Nur Hidayati of Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI). &quot;Our communities demand Newmont end its practice of dumping mine wastes into the ocean. This irresponsible practice poses high risks to the environment and the community -- and it is not allowed in the United States where Newmont is based.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of the international delegation highlighted the hardships faced by hundreds of farmers in Rosia Montana, Romania, and villagers in the Ahafo region of Ghana, who are being displaced from their homes to make way for large, industrial gold mines owned by Newmont and its partners.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I have come from Romania to tell Newmont that the people of Rosia Montana will not be forced from our homes and our land,&quot; stated Stephanie Roth of Alburnus Maior, a community group of farmers and property owners in Rosia Montana. &quot;Newmont has not obtained the community's consent to operate in Rosia Montana. It's time for them to cut their losses and leave the project.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have been trying to engage with Newmont for several years and have yet to see real change in their practices,&quot; said Father Marco Arana of Grufides, an environmental and social justice organization based in Cajamarca, Peru. &quot;It took 30,000 people protesting in the streets of Cajamarca for them to finally recognize there were serious problems.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Newmont has had trouble with its operations much closer to home as well. In Nevada, the Western Shoshone people continue to defend their right to live off of their own land, in their traditional lifestyle. &quot;Any damage to our land has a direct impact on our people, our home, and our cultural and spiritual way of life, said Kristi Begay, a member of the Western Shoshone Nation, and a Wells Band Council Chairwoman. &quot;Although our elders are passing on, as the younger generation, we will continue this fight until our issues and concerns are resolved.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While each member of this international delegation has unique concerns, all representatives have these demands in common and call on Newmont Mining to:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Respect human rights by:</b></font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fully respecting all human rights and not committing human rights violations, including intimidation of community members and activists.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Refraining from projects that have not secured the free, prior, and informed consent of the communities concerned.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fully disclosing information about the environmental and social impacts of projects.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Providing fair and just compensation for local communities affected by mining.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Respecting the spiritual and cultural values of communities.<br></font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Respect the environment by:</b></font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ending the practice of ocean dumping of mine wastes.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Protecting water resources from pollution and depletion.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keeping sites of spiritual significance and protected areas off limits from mining.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ensuring that operations will not result in sulfuric acid drainage to water and soil.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Providing guaranteed funding, before beginning a project, that will fully cover reclamation and closure costs.</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Addressing needs left behind by closed mines such as clean- up, reclamation, remedying health impacts, and making land compensations.<br></font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A brief profile and statement from each representative follows:</b></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stephanie Roth, Rosia Montana, Romania -- Roth is a former researcher and editor at the London-based magazine <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/" target="_new">The Ecologist </a>who was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize this week for her work with Alburnus Maior, a community group working with farmers and property owners in Rosia Montana, Romania, to halt development of Europe's largest open-pit cyanide leach gold mine.
