<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 25 - Marq Anderson, American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) national tour manager, arrives at Camp Casey to return the military combat boots worn in Iraq by fallen U.S. soldier, Casey Sheehan to his grieving mother, Cindy Sheehan, in Crawford, Texas on Thursday, August 25, at 11:30 a.m. EST (10:30 a.m. CST).

<p>Sheehan donated her son Casey's boots to AFSC's traveling exhibition Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War earlier this year. In a memorial ceremony held at Independence Mall in Philadelphia over the July 4 weekend, Sheehan tearfully sat Casey's boots alongside thousands of other combat boots representing military casualties while Eyes Wide Open was on display. On August 22, Casey's boots were removed from the exhibition.

<p>Eyes Wide Open features a pair of combat boots for every military casualty in Iraq. A portion of the exhibition, featuring boots that represent every National Guard member killed in Iraq, is currently on display in Buffalo, New York. The full exhibition will stop in Baltimore, Maryland, at Johns Hopkins University, Greater Homewood Campus, on the anniversary of September 11.

<p>Marq has been in regular contact with Cindy since her arrival in Crawford. Sheehan was forced to leave Crawford last week after learning her mother suffered a stroke. She returned last night.

<p>The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), an international social justice organization and co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, was one of the first organizations calling for the complete withdrawal of troops from Iraq. The Service Committee's acclaimed exhibition: Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War has traveled across the United States, visiting more than 60 cities and sites such as the National Civil Rights Museum, Independence Mall and Capitol Hill.
