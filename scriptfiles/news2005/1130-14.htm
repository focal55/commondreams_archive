<p>NEW YORK - November 30 - On November 30, 2005,
Amnesty International will host the second panel in a
year-long series in New York City to bring greater
attention to war crimes against women.  From 7:00 to
9:00pm at Judson Church, adjacent to New York
University Law School, panelists Sandra Krause, Rachel
Mayanja, Peter Takirambude, and Alex de Waal will
address the ongoing brutalization and murder of women
in Darfur, Sudan, and the legal and practical
challenges in bringing criminals to justice and
treating survivors.  Darfur is a devastating example
of how state-sanctioned violence against women has
emptied the land of habitants, creating an ethnic
apartheid and a state of impunity.

<p>The series is one part of Amnesty's campaign to
raise public awareness about rape and other violence
against women as weapons of war, and to mount action
to bring to justice perpetrators of war crimes against
women.  Our government has called the killings in
Darfur a genocide, and whether one agrees or calls it
ethnic cleansing, the rape of women is an integral
method to the destruction of life and community
ongoing there.  Just as in Bosnia and Rwanda, government-sponsored combatants are targeting women to eliminate specific groups of people," said Denise Bell, an Amnesty activist working on the issue. 
"Our government and others will not act to stop the
killings until there is a political cost to inaction. 
Citizen pressure is the remaining course of action. 
History shows that genocide will continue until there
is sufficient public outrage to compel leaders to act.
 Amnesty is acting to press governments to hold
perpetrators accountable, and the series is one way of galvanizing public pressure so the killings and rapes in Darfur are stopped and the perpetrators are brought to justice."
