<p>WASHINGTON - December 2 - As fans worldwide mark  with sorrow the 25th anniversary of John Lennon's death, Amnesty  International USA (AIUSA) continues to use his music to champion  his message. The world's largest grassroots human rights  organization recently concluded its two-year-long Imagine  campaign and prepares to launch a new global venture involving  top artists performing Lennon's songs.</p>
<p>   &quot;John Lennon's message of hope lives on in his art, which  continues to resonate today, two and a half decades after his  tragic death,&quot; said AIUSA Executive Director Dr. William F.  Schulz. &quot;AIUSA is honored to help continue his legacy by using  his music to advance the vision he articulated so eloquently.&quot;</p>

<p>   Launched in 2002 after Yoko Ono's generous gift of the rights  to her late husband's unparalleled anthem, Imagine, AIUSA's  Imagine campaign involved print, film, television and the  Internet. San Francisco-based Collaborate agency produced print  ads, with the internationally renowned Magnum Photos the  exclusive photographic sponsor. The print campaign launched with  a four-page ad insert in The New Yorker and ran in dozens of  magazines.</p>
<p>   A music video and television PSAs, filmed by director Paul  Dektor, featured children in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United  States singing Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer's and  Stewart Levine's new version of Imagine. The video premiered at  the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival in New York City and was  subsequently seen in more than 50 countries around the world, in  cities from Dublin to Moscow, Lima to Tehran.</p>
<p>   Enthusiasm for the Imagine campaign was infectious. Actress  and singer Mandy Moore created a special Imagine t-shirt with an  original hand-drawn design. The French</p>
<p>   Canadian section of Amnesty International assembled 80  Canadian pop stars to record a new version of Give Peace a Chance  in the same Montreal hotel suite where it had first been recorded  35 years before. For more on the campaign, please see  <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/imagine/">http://www.amnestyusa.org/imagine/</a>.</p>
<p>   The Imagine campaign originated in the aftermath of September  11th, when actor Gabriel Byrne saw a children's choir sing a  moving version of Imagine at his niece's graduation ceremony.  Inspired, Byrne -- a longtime Amnesty International supporter --  proposed to AIUSA Marketing Director Helen Garrett that the  organization make the song the centerpiece of a new campaign to  educate and inspire young people worldwide about human rights.  Yoko Ono was equally enthusiastic, and she generously agreed to  grant the song's license. The shared vision: to engage and  inspire a new wave of human rights activism.</p>

<p>   Ono told Billboard Magazine that her decision to give Amnesty  International the use of the song was based on the organization's  40-year career of fighting for human rights throughout the world  -- &quot;work that embodies the spirit of Imagine.&quot;</p>
<p>   And AIUSA was thrilled when Ono, recognizing the continued  urgency of human rights activism in today's world, generously  gifted Amnesty International the recording rights to John  Lennon's entire solo songbook, paving the way for a new campaign  using Lennon's music.</p>
<p>   On December 10, 2005, to coincide with Human Rights Day, and  just after the 25th anniversary of John Lennon's death on  December 8, Amnesty International will unveil a new global  venture involving Lennon's music performed by an international  roster of renowned artists. The campaign launches with a bundle  of exclusive downloadable singles, followed in early 2006 by the  release of an array of new versions of iconic John Lennon tracks  from top musicians.</p>
<p>   The artists involved are supporters of human rights as well as  favorites of young people worldwide. Forward-looking and  celebratory, the venture aims to attract one million new young  human rights activists around the globe.

<p>   &quot;The world needs John Lennon's spirit now more than ever,&quot;  said Garrett. &quot;AIUSA is grateful to Yoko Ono for the opportunity  to continue her late husband's legacy. We hope to use the unique  power of his music to inspire a new generation to stand up for  human rights.&quot;</p>
