<p> WASHINGTON - December 7 - According to a October 2005 Harris Poll, only nine percent of the American public considers the pharmaceutical industry generally honest and trustworthy.

<p> If perception were reality, the prescription drug industry would be in Chapter 11. Whether it is anger at the callous disregard for human health revealed in the Vioxx and SSRI scandals; irritation with the incessant peddling of drugs directly to consumers and giveaways to doctors; ire at the frustration with the concealment of adverse clinical trial findings; exasperation that safe, cheap drugs are barred from importation from Canada; or disgust with conflicts of interest in the drug approval process and the buying of political influence, over 90 percent of the public views the drug industry with suspicion. A majority say they want more, not less, regulation. Indeed, industry sales are down this year and companies are laying off thousands of workers. But these selective factoids can be deceiving: Pfizer is among the companies cutting its workforce, while its profits for 2005 will be $8 billion. Hold your pity. 

<p> Not only do Americans not trust the industry, but there is a crisis of confidence in the FDA as an impartial arbiter of drug safety and effectiveness. The public understands that “He who pays the piper calls the tune.” More than half of the agency’s drug budget comes from industry user fees earmarked for speeding up the approval of drugs. As a result, the FDA, long established as the “gold standard” of consumer protection against industry’s dangerous drugs, now treats the industry as its primary client. 

<p> If we, the public, can’t rely on either industry or FDA to tell it to us straight, then where can we turn for independent and reliable information about prescription drugs? 

<p> GAP has set out to help fill this void with our own “Fact Squad” of experts, compiled with the guidance of award-winning investigative journalist Jeanne Lenzer. In commending this “Fact Squad” to the public and the news media, we ask that you take note of their backgrounds, education and accomplishments, and give due consideration to their perspectives. The pharmaceutical industry has a story to tell -- and a bottomless bank account with which to tell it -- but it is a self-interested story. Our “Fact Squad” will help complete the picture by bringing into focus the findings of experts whose first concern is the public interest. 

<p> Scroll down and review their credential and areas of expertise. GAP will be happy to put you in touch with them. Contact Food and Drug Safety Director Mark Cohen at markc@whistleblower.org or call Mark at (202) 408-0034 x128.
