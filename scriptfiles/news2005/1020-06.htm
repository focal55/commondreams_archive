<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON - This bill is based on a series of fabrications and half-truths, and its supporters have twisted the facts in an attempt to defend the indefensible -- the idea that gun sellers should be shielded from the legal consequences of their own misconduct.

<p>The National Rifle Association and its allies have claimed that civil lawsuits are a threat to the U.S. firearms industry, yet many of the gun makers involved in irresponsible distribution practices that put firearms in the hands of criminals are foreign corporations.  The supporters of this bill argue that greedy lawyers are threatening to bankrupt the gun industry, yet the most serious financial threat to a major gun maker in recent years was the gun lobby-backed boycott of Smith & Wesson in retaliation for the company's agreement to adopt responsible sales and marketing practices.

<p>Meanwhile, recent data has shown that fewer than 1 percent of gun dealers sell 57 percent of the guns later traced in connection with criminal investigations.  The fact is that with earlier NRA-backed bills cutting the budget and gutting the legal authority for enforcement of the nation's gun laws, private lawsuits are one of the few tools left to hold corrupt, negligent, and reckless gun sellers accountable for funneling guns to criminals.

<p>The only good news is that many lawsuits against the firearms industry are likely to survive despite the NRA's ham-fisted attempt to protect gun sellers from the consequences of their own misconduct.  We plan to move forward with our lawsuit against the gun makers and dealers involved in the sale of guns to Buford Furrow, the convicted felon, ex-mental patient, and white supremacist who went on a shooting rampage at a Jewish day care center near Los Angeles, and we believe nothing in the new gun industry immunity bill will prevent us from obtaining a judgment against these companies.
