<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON --January 7 -- This afternoon, ANIMAL cofounders Bucky Turco and Matt Trumino, and artist Chris Savido launched ART for FREEDOM, a new EBAY charity auction featuring the controversial &#147;Bush Monkeys&#148; painting and work from 10 other banned artists.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The artists, who will donate 50% of their proceeds to charity, posted a like-minded challenge to President Bush on the Jumbotron above New York's Holland tunnel -- cancel the inappropriately lavish inauguration gala and redirect the estimated $ 40 million in party expenses to charity. The electronic billboard, seen by over 400k people a day was donated by an annoymous Republican sympathetic to ANIMAL's predicament. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We&#146;re using our talents to help make America a better place,&#148; said Mr. Turco. &#147;We challenge the President to do same, and put this shameful gala money to good use.&#148;<br>Aside from Mr. Savido, the participating artists include Chris Clinton, Eric Doeringer, Fiorentina De Biasi, Juan Doe, Michael Anderson, Ron Upperman, Vincent Michea, Jason Roumas, and legendary graffiti writers GHOST and SEEN. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charitable proceeds from the ANIMAL ART for FREEDOM auction will go to support anti-censorship and anti-war initiatives administered by the National Coalition Against Censorship (<a href="http://www.ncac.org/" target="_new">www.ncac.org</a>) and Veterans for Peace/Iraq Veterans Against the War (<a href="http://www.ivaw.net" target="_new">http://www.ivaw.net</a>).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funds administered by the National Coalition Against Censorship will be primarily administered by the organization&#146;s Arts Advocacy Project, which protects artists' freedom of expression. Funds directed to the Veterans for Peace will be administered primarily by its Iraq Veterans Against the War subsidiary, which is committed to ending the war in Iraq and providing serving soldiers with support, and awareness of serious equipment shortages, especially body armor. Turco explains, &quot;It's kind of absolute madness on behalf of the administration to not only ask these young people to fight an unjust war, but too also ask them to do with so without proper gear.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EBAY auction title is &quot;ART FOR FREEDOM.&#148; An extended mission statement, including details about the auction structure, administration and use of proceeds is available at <a href="http://www.animalnewyork.com" target="_new">www.animalnewyork.com</a> <br> <br><i>About &#147;Bush Monkeys&#148;</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since it was censored by New York City's Chelsea Market on December 8th, Chris Savido's &quot;Bush Monkeys&quot; painting has fueled a heated global dialogue on a range of issues, from censorship to the war in Iraq. </font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The picture, which presents portrait of President Bush composed of a band of chimpanzees in a boggy marsh, was banned by the Chelsea Market in response to pressure from Bush supporters.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The story has been covered by hundreds of news organizations, from the New York Times to the BBC. Thousand have logged into Yahoo and other online message boards and blogs to register their feelings about the piece. </font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More information on the painting censorship is provided at www.animalnewyork.com<br> <br>About The Jumbotron</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the auction, the &quot;Bush Monkeys&quot; auction announcement will be broadcast approxImately 15X an hour on the &quot;Jumbotron&quot; digital billboard located near the Manhattan entrance to the Holland Tunnel. An estimated 400,000 drivers commuting between Manhattan and New Jersey will pass by the sign each day.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Having Chris&#146;s work visible to so many is, in itself, a victory against the forces of censorship,&#148; noted Turco. The billboard space was donated by an annoymous Republican donor sympathetic to ANIMAL's cause.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About ANIMAL</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ANIMAL is a leading exhibitor and publisher of new art from emerging urban artists in New York City and around the world.
