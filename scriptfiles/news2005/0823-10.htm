<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SEELOW, Germany - August 23 -  Greenpeace today demanded that two of 
the largest European dairy companies must stop buying their milk from 
dairy farmers who grow GE maize, to avoid the potential contamination of 
the food chain. To illustrate the risk, a life-size sculpture of a cow 
with a see-through stomach filled with animal feed was placed by 
activists in a field growing the GE crop in Seelow, Brandenburg near the 
Polish border. Several farmers in Brandenburg growing GE maize, deliver 
milk to Campina and Mueller, who sell it directly to consumers.

<p>European consumers have consistently rejected food that is genetically 
engineered (GE). As a result there are hardly any GE labelled food 
products on the European market. However, EU labelling law contains a 
loophole; milk, eggs, meat and other animal-derived foodstuffs do not 
need to be labelled if the animals were fed genetically modified 
organisms (GMOs). As most of the GE maize grown in Europe is used as 
animal feed, European consumers could unknowingly consume GE derived 
products, such as milk.

<p>"Despite huge opposition to GMOs in the food chain from European 
consumers, Mueller and Campina refuse to guarantee that their dairy 
cattle are not fed on GE maize," said Geert Ritsema, Greenpeace 
International GE Campaigner. "Through advertising their products as pure 
and natural, they are misleading their consumers as their products risk 
being contaminated from the GE crops grown by their dairy farmers."

<p>Other European countries have taken steps to ensure their products are 
completely GE free. Food manufacturers have ensured that GE animal feed 
is not used in Switzerland and Sweden. In Austria, the large dairy 
company, NOEM AG, ensured its entire range of fresh milk products are 
"GE free".

<p>The U.S. biotech company, Monsanto, produces the GE maize (MON 810) sown 
in the fields of Seelow. The European Commission gave approval for the 
GE maize to be grown in the EU in 2004. However, a debate about its 
safety for the environment is still ongoing. As a result the Governments 
of Austria, Greece, Hungary and Poland have banned the maize. Currently 
this particular crop of GE maize is the only GE plant permitted to be 
grown throughout the EU. Other GE maize and GE Soya varieties, 
cultivated outside the EU, are authorised for import as animal feed.

<p>Greenpeace is demanding that the European dairy industry take steps to 
stop the cultivation of GE maize in the EU, and to stop importing GE 
maize, GE Soya and other GE plants grown outside the EU to use in animal 
feed. Companies such as Campina and Mueller can make a significant 
contribution to stopping the use of GE animal feed by insisting that 
their milk only comes from non-GE suppliers.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
