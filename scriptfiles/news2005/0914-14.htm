<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 14 - Human Rights Campaign supporters and members have given their time and ten of thousands of dollars to relief efforts. Following the hurricane, a link from www.hrc.org raised tens of thousands for relief efforts by the Rainbow World Fund, which has raised $250,000 so far. Additionally, HRC’s previously scheduled Comedy Rocks event on Sept. 30 will now benefit the NAACP Disaster Relief Fund and the Hurricane Katrina Relief Fund Coalition, a targeted effort coordinated by the National Youth Advocacy Coalition.

<p>“The Human Rights Campaign family is among the millions of Americans involved in relief efforts,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “This tragedy continues to affect us all and our involvement can’t be measured in time, dollars or cents.”

<p>Solmonese added, “From ensuring that survivors have the resources they need to fighting discrimination in housing, HRC is working to get GLBT families help. Our allies are also working to ensure the safety and well-being of the GLBT community affected by this tragedy. If you’re looking for a way to help, visit <a href="http://www.hrc.org/hurricane_relief%20" target="_new">www.hrc.org/hurricane_relief </a>for ways to get involved.”

<p>HRC also sent a letter to Congress on Sept. 9 highlighting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues and relief efforts. In addition, HRC has been fielding calls from evacuees and service providers. As Congress considers a series of bills to respond to the tragedy, HRC will work to ensure that any relief or aid is inclusive of all Americans affected by the tragedy, including GLBT Americans.
