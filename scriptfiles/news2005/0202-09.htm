<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 2 -- News Advisory: Large TV Buy in Montana Calls Bush Plan 'Working Retirement' for Seniors</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">View Ad at: <a href="http://cdn.moveon.org/content/video/SS_ad.wmv" target="_new">http://cdn.moveon.org/content/video/SS_ad.wmv</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As President Bush tours the country promoting his plan to privatize Social Security, members of MoveOn.org, a nation-wide three-million-member grassroots organization, will challenge him at each stop over his plan to cut to Social Security benefits.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The MoveOn.org effort is part of a national campaign coordinated by the Campaign for America's Future, including groups such as: U.S. Action, ACORN, AFL-CIO, Alliance for Retired Americans, National Organization for Women, Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities, NAACP, League of United Latin American Citizens, and others.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Starting today, MoveOn.org will air a television ad called &quot;Working Retirement&quot; in Great Falls, Montana, where the President is expected to stump on Thursday. The ad also airs this week in the districts of three Members of Congress -- Allen Boyd (D-Fla.), Chris Chocola (R-Ind.), and Jim Gerlach (R-Pa.) -- who may support the President's plan to privatize Social Security. MoveOn.org is running a full-page advertisement in today's New York Times.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We can't countenance Bush's plan to cut Social Security benefits by up to 46 percent when small adjustments in the system would put it in the black indefinitely,&quot; said Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org Executive Director. &quot;We will make sure that Members of Congress who consider supporting a plan that reduces benefits for future retirees know that their constituents will hear from us -- and they will hear from their constituents.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To view the ad, visit: <a href="http://cdn.moveon.org/content/video/SS_ad.wmv" target="_new">http://cdn.moveon.org/content/video/SS_ad.wmv</a>.
