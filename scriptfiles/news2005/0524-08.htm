<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 24 -- Families across the country are angered and offended today by the Senate's decision to deal away equality, insuring that bad judges will be confirmed and continue to impose hardships on gay and lesbian couples and their children. In an attempt to temporarily stop the nuclear option, Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that members of a hate-filled fanatical faction are fit to rule the American people.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a bleak day for our families,&quot; said Jody Huckaby, executive director of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG). &quot;The radical right continues to prey on our loved ones and, as evidenced by this deal, we have no defenders.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the judges who will be confirmed under the terms of the nuclear option deal, William Pryor, is perhaps the most dangerous enemy to GLBT families in the judicial system today. Pryor banned children from being adopted by their gay parents in Florida, filed an amicus brief to the Supreme court supporting punishment and imprisonment for gay men and lesbians and compared same-sex relationships to pedophilia, bestiality and necrophilia. This is the kind of judge the supposedly moderate Senators who agreed to this deal have allowed to pass.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The deal insures that our courts will be packed with extremist lifetime judicial appointees, who value the politically powerful over ordinary American families,&quot; said Elizabeth Hampton Brown, a former civil rights' scholar for the Department of Justice and PFLAG staffer.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the midst of a frenzy of bigotry and hatred, PFLAG families are more important today than ever before as deputy executive director Ron Schlittler summed up, &quot;We will continue to do everything in our power to protect and defend our children, loved ones and friends -- even when our own government will not.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) is the nation's foremost family-based organization committed to the civil rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender persons. Founded in 1973 by mothers and fathers, PFLAG has 200,000 members and supporters in more than 500 chapters throughout the United States.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
