<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 22 - To assist reporters in covering the impacts and lessons of Hurricane Rita, we have compiled a list of relevant environmental and public health issues where the Sierra Club can offer expertise. Following the list is a summary of Sierra Club experts in Texas and Louisiana as well as key national staff.</font></p>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GLOBAL WARMING</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most climate scientists are now saying with certainty that global warming is occurring, and that humans are playing a major role by releasing pollution that creates a heat trapping blanket around the globe. As the planet warms, the World Meteorological Organization says we can expect more violent and extreme weather, like hurricanes.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IMPACT ON COASTLINE AND COASTAL DEVELOPMENT</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both the Texas and Louisiana coasts are very dynamic. If the coastlines themselves were to shift as a result of Hurricane Rita, it would have major implications for the people who live on the shore. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POTENTIAL FLOODING</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is always potential for flooding in the event of a major hurricane because of both the storm surge and rainfall. Depletion of wetlands robs communities of a key protection from floods. Groundwater pumping in cities like Houston and Galveston have also lowered their elevation and increased risk for flooding. In addition, the first flush of runoff as a result of flooding can carry toxic pollution into waterways. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POTENTIAL FOR OIL AND CHEMICAL SPILLS</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we saw with Hurricane Katrina, oil and gas drilling operations, refineries, and other industrial facilities are not equipped to handle extreme hurricanes. Severe storms can result in spills and leaks that pollute land and waterways. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GAS PRICES AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hurricanes Katrina and Rita spotlight the danger of America's dependence on oil, and how fragile the nation's reliance on it is. These hurricanes have seriously affected the production, refinery capacity, and price of oil in the United States. America can decrease the effect of future disruptions by reducing our dependence on oil, not putting up more rigs and drilling our special places. The United States is responsible for 25 percent of the world's oil consumption, and yet we have less than 3 percent of the world's oil supplies. Additionally, the current lack of refinery capacity is the result of a conscious decision by the oil industry in the 1990s to limit supply to increase profitability - and they have succeeded. Exxon is the most profitable company in the world, and just last quarter posted profits of $7.84 billion.</font></P>
