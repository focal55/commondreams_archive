He said today: &quot;The election in the occupied territories is deeply flawed. Israel, the Palestinian Authority and many members of the international community have done all they can to ensure that the outcome is predetermined and there is no genuine contest of ideas or candidates. As significant, the vast majority of Palestinians do not live in the occupied territories, but in the Diaspora, as refugees and exiles. They are banned from voting, or from freely traveling to their homeland to participate. This contrasts with the Afghan election, and the scheduled Iraqi elections, where enormous international efforts have been made to enable refugees and exiles to vote. Many Palestinians believe that these elections are intended to produce a compliant, unrepresentative leadership that will sign a deal with Israel giving up their basic rights.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBERT PARRY, <a href="mailto:secrecyprivilege@aol.com" target="_new">secrecyprivilege@aol.com</a>,<a href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/" target="_new"> www.consortiumnews.com</a><br>Newsweek is reporting in a just-published article, entitled &quot;'The Salvador Option' -- The Pentagon may put Special-Forces-led assassination or kidnapping teams in Iraq,&quot; that &quot;the Pentagon is intensively debating an option that dates back to a still-secret strategy in the Reagan administration's battle against the leftist guerrilla insurgency in El Salvador in the early 1980s.&quot; [See: <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0109-06.htm" target="_new">www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0109-06.htm</a>.]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parry wrote in an article in November 2003 that &quot;many top Bush aides played key roles in the repression of leftist peasant uprisings in Central America in the 1980s, a set of lessons the Bush administration is now trying to apply to the violent resistance in Iraq.&quot; See: <a href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/2003/111303.html" target="_new">www.consortiumnews.com/2003/111303.html</a>, <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/06/1443253" target="_new">www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/06/1443253</a>.

Conteris said today: &quot;It's clear that what the U.S. is moving to in Iraq is a Death Squad Democracy, with units like Battalion 316 which operated in Honduras with the support of John Negroponte.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
