<p>Thanksgiving is a time for families to gather to give thanks and celebrate the year's achievements. In this spirit, the family of Camp Casey and the Crawford Peace Movement will reunite in Crawford, Texas this Thanksgiving to celebrate our work, remember those who are no longer with us, and share our stories, our lives, and the wealth of our community. 

<p>The past year has seen many tragic milestones in the war on Iraq.  Despite the President's assertion that major combat ended last year, military operations have continued, and resulted in the destruction of the city of Falluja, 2,038 American deaths, 200,000 Iraqi deaths, 199 coalition deaths, and 15,353 American soldiers wounded. But this year has also been a year of victories for our movement ( figures as of 11/04/05). 

<p>This past August, our community united in Crawford with Cindy Sheehan to demand that the President explain the "noble cause" for which he claims our troops have died.  Then, on September 24, we massed over 200,000 people in Washington D.C. to send a clear message to the world that we do not consent to wars of conquest in our name and demand that the troops be brought home NOW!

<p>Since Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana, claiming over 1,000 American lives, the Crawford coalition has been providing material assistance to the people of New Orleans while the government struggles under the weight of its own bureaucracy. 


<p>After we left Crawford at the end of August, McLennan County designated the county bar ditches  "no speech zones" by making it illegal to camp, eat or erect a structure for "living" in them .  Additionally, they created a "no parking zone" for a 7 mile radius around the Bush ranch. This is a violation of our constitutional rights to free speech and free assembly. On Tuesday, November 22, some of us will challenge this ordinance by gathering in the Camp Casey 1 ditch to let George Bush know that he cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to our grievances. 

<p>In solidarity with people who continue to suffer as a result of the President's failed war in Iraq, we will forgo the standard excessive American Thanksgiving feast for a simple Iraqi meal.  We will organize food and monetary donations for a convoy coming through Crawford to take to New Orleans to those who continue to struggle to rebuild their lives. 

<p>Friday, we will dedicate the new Memorial Garden at the Crawford
Peace House. This will include the carved stone that was started this summer.

<p>Saturday, we will engage in a demonstration (march/rally/caravan, details to be announced.  We will disband on Sunday to return to our local communities to continue our campaign to end the war and bring our troops home. 

<p>We are requesting each organization to collect donations of non perishable food or funds from their membership and supporters, as well as post information about this event on their websites.  We must keep the war at the forefront of public consciousness this holiday season. One more death is too many; tomorrow is too late. Let us come together in community to renew our commitment to end the suffering NOW! 

<p>The Crawford Peace House will secure access to Tonkawa Falls State Park for camping, if needed.  Shuttles will also be needed.

<p>Contact the Crawford Peace House at 254-486-0099 for more information.  Check the Crawford Peace House Website for updated information about the event. 

<p>Please RSVP to the Crawford Peace House to let them know if you plan to attend the Thanksgiving event, so that we can prepare for the correct number of people.  When you call, please let the Peace House know if you are willing to volunteer.  We will need the same kinds of volunteers that we did during the summer encampment and we know that you will all rise to this effort.  Thanks so much.  We look forward to seeing you again.
