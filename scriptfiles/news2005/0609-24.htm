<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -- June 9 - Green leaders reiterated the party's July 2003 call for 
impeachment of Bush, and called on all Americans outraged by the Bush 
Administration's list of deceptions, violations of the U.S. Constitution, 
the disastrous Iraq occupation, and policies that have disgraced the U.S. to 
demand that Congress begin the impeachment process.

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The invasion and occupation of Iraq has caused the deaths of over 1,600 
U.S. military personnel, as well as untold suffering and tens of thousands 
of civilian dead in Iraq," said David Cobb, the Green Party's 2004 candidate 
for President of the United States.  "The Downing Street Memo confirms what 
we already knew -- that a conspiracy to deceive the American people led us 
into the war, and that this conspiracy constitutes 'high crimes and 
misdemeanors' according to the U.S. Constitution."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Green Party of the United States called for the impeachment of George W. 
Bush during the party's 2003 <a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_21_03.html" target="_new">national meeting</a> 
<a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_21_03.html"><http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_21_03.html></a>.  Greens have organized and 
participated in numerous protests against the war since early 2003, and have 
called for an immediate end to the occupation, cancellation of further war 
spending, and removal of military recruiters from schools as U.S. troops 
continue to face death and injury in Iraq.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greens praised Rep. John Conyers' (D-Mich.) public demand for an explanation 
from President Bush in the wake of Downing Street Memo's publication, and 
questioned why so many of the mainstream U.S. media have remained silent on 
the content and implications of the memo.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Greens also called many Democrats as responsible as Republicans for Iraq 
policy, having voted in October 2002 to transfer war power to the President, 
which created the scenario for White House deceit and abuse of power, and 
having recently voted for another $82 billion for the war.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It was already apparent, long before the Downing Street Memo, that 
President Bush's case for invading Iraq was based on fraud," said Rebecca 
Rotzler, co-chair of the Green Party's Peace Action Committee.  "All of the 
reasons for invasion that Mr. Bush listed in his January 28, 2003 State of 
the Union address -- Iraqi WMDs, collusion between Saddam Hussein and 
al-Qaeda, evidence that Saddam had sought nuclear weapons materials from 
Africa, nuclear aluminum rods, Iraq's supposed threat to the U.S. and to 
other nations -- are now known to be false.  The Downing Street Memo shows 
that the intelligence supporting an invasion was fixed, with the complicity 
of the Bush and Blair administrations as early as July 2002."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Green Party leaders also noted that Ahmed Chalabi, whose false testimony to 
U.S. intelligence officials on Iraqi WMDs formed much of the basis of the 
claim that Saddam Hussein was an iternational threat, is now serving as 
interim Iraqi Oil Minister, with the Bush Administration's approval; and 
that John Bolton, now under consideration for appointment as U.S. Ambassador 
to the U.N., repeatedly manipulated intelligence and lied to the U.S. media 
and the U.N. about Iraqi weapons materials.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Americans should be protesting in every way possible against the continued 
occupation of Iraq, and for impeachment of President Bush and Vice President 
Cheney," said Jake Schneider, treasurer of the Green Party of the United 
States.  "But this has also been a bipartisan war all along, and every 
Democrat and Republican in Congress who has supported it despite evidence of 
deceit from the very beginning also deserves removal from office."
