<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 16 --  With the Senate Energy Committee beginning action on energy legislation and gasoline prices still high as the summer driving season approaches, a new group of experts representing an even broader range of political views is calling on Senator Pete Domenici, Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to cut U.S. oil use through the accelerated introduction of advanced technology vehicles and alternative fuels.  <br> <br>In late March a group of top national security experts sent a letter to the President urging an aggressive program to address America's growing dependence on foreign oil. This week leading experts will be offering further recommendations for a new model of energy production and use. Implementing these technologies through the energy bill and other legislation would jump-start new industries through technological innovation, spurring job creation and economic growth.<br> <br><b>WHO:</b> Frank J.
