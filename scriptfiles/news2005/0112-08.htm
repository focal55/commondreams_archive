<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 12 -- A group of concerned consumers, led by sugar cane and sugar beet farmers across America, today launched the website http://www.truthaboutsplenda.com to better educate consumers about the chlorinated artificial sweetener Splenda.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Johnson &amp; Johnson, which markets Splenda, has led consumers, reporters and the general public to believe that this chemical sweetener is somehow natural. The highly publicized slogan &quot;Made from Sugar so it Tastes Like Sugar&quot; is deceptive and misleads consumers about what they are feeding their families. Just one indication of the public's confusion can be seen in a recent poll, undertaken by a national consumer group, stating that nearly half of present and past Splenda users believe it is &quot;natural.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The truth is Splenda is not grown in a sugar beet or a sugar cane field. It's manufactured in a chemical plant,&quot; Andy Briscoe, President and CEO of the Sugar Association, recently commented. &quot;It's a highly processed chlorinated sweetener, and no one knows for sure what the long term effects may be. I am sure of one thing: it's not natural.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The website -- <a href="http://www.truthaboutsplenda.com/" target="_new">http://www.truthaboutsplenda.com</a> --is only the first step in building a nationwide coalition of people and organizations committed to ensuring that the American people are better educated about the fact that Splenda is an artificial sweetener which contains chlorine.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about the &quot;Truth About Splenda&quot; campaign or to get involved, please contact Rich Masters at Qorvis Communications, 202-496-1000, e-mail <a href="mailto:rmasters@qorvis.com" target="_new">rmasters@qorvis.com</a> , or visit the website at <a href="http://www.truthaboutsplenda.com/" target="_new">http://www.truthaboutsplenda.com</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
