<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 11 -- </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable David M. Walker<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comptroller General<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Government Accountability Office<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">441 G Street, NW<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, DC 20548</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. Walker: </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are writing to request that the Government Accountability Office examine the use of covert propaganda by departments and agencies under the Bush Administration.</font></p><p>  </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past year, GAO has released two legal analyses finding that the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy violated the congressional prohibition on publicity and propaganda by distributing fabricated video news reports.  Last week, we learned that the Department of Education paid a conservative commentator to support the No Child Left Behind Act in television and radio appearances.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The federal use of covert propaganda is unethical, damaging to our democracy and open society, and, as you know, illegal.  While the three incidents described above are deeply troubling and are a cause for concern in their own right, it would be abhorrent to our system of government if these incidents were part of a pattern of covert propaganda funded with taxpayer dollars. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In particular, we request that GAO: </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1)        Survey federal departments and agencies to identify and describe all contracts signed since January 1, 2001, with public relations firms, advertising agencies, media organizations, and individual members of the media.  Please include in the description (a) the costs of each contract, (b) a summary of the purposes of the contract, (c) the method by which the contract was awarded, and (d) a description of the work performed under the contract.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2)        In the case of any contract identified under (1) that relies on subcontracts, identify and describe the subcontracts.  Please include in the description (a) the costs of each subcontract, (b) a summary of the purposes of the subcontract, (c) the method by which the subcontract was awarded, and (d) a description of the work performed under the subcontract.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3)        Assess whether the contracts and subcontracts comply with the prohibitions on publicity and propaganda and the requirements of the Anti-Lobbying Act. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We recognize that a comprehensive survey of federal departments and agencies may be a large undertaking.  We ask that you focus your initial attention on covert propaganda related to the following seven topics:</font></p><p>  </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The No Child Left Behind Act and its implementation; <br>            The Medicare Modernization Act and its implementation; <br>            Tax legislation signed or proposed by President Bush; <br>            Social Security reform; <br>            The war in Iraq; <br>            Homeland security; <br>            Energy and the environment. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are available to work with you to refine this request as you proceed with the investigative work.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Nancy Pelosi                            Henry A.
