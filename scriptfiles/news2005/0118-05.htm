<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 18 --  &quot;Good people resorting to desperate measures to end a pregnancy is the predictable result of a political environment of misinformation, legislative manipulation and cultural shaming&quot;, states Steven Emmert, Executive Director of NCAP, the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. Referring specifically to the tragic incident in Michigan where a young man, allegedly at the request of his pregnant girlfriend, hit her in the abdomen with a baseball bat until she miscarried, Emmert maintains the couple was told, untruthfully, that abortion was not an option.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Reproductive health care and pregnancy choices are personal decisions, not political issues. Complete and accurate information about all medical options surrounding pregnancy is the best assurance for healthy and responsible decision-making&quot;, states Emmert. &quot;In the not so distant past, providers often heard about desperate, and often life-threatening, self-abortion methods being considered by women. Now, we are beginning to see these horrifying methods from the past reappear in the news. Our long history in this work tells us that with the suppression of accurate information, we are likely to see much, much more.&quot; Recalling President Bush's own statement that he was &quot;unsure&quot; of his stance on abortion, Emmert asserts this speaks clearly to the need for more open conversations, not debates, on the complex issues surrounding pregnancy decisions. &quot;This step alone could help unify a greatly divided nation,&quot; asserts Emmert.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans know that emotionally and physically healthy women strengthen families, strengthen communities, and strengthen America. Abortion Providers step forward with their hearts and their courage each day, breaking the harmful silence and challenging the stigma surrounding abortion.&quot; NCAP members around the nation provide opportunities for open conversation about abortion in spite of the chaos of threats, the resurgence of violence, and the daily rush of States to enact fear-based legislation.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
