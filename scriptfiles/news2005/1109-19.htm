<p>WASHINGTON - November 9 - The stakes couldn't be higher--with even more deaths in Iraq, increased aggression in Nigeria, record gas prices, the devastation of 
Hurricane Katrina, and the Arctic melting faster than ever before, we can't 
afford to wait any longer to declare our independence from oil. It's time that 
we let Ford, the worst polluter in the automobile industry, know they must stop 
driving this chaos and destruction.<br /><br />The United States is addicted to oil. 
Although Americans constitute less than 5 percent of the world's population, we 
consume 25 percent of its oil. This addiction contributes to a host of problems: 
rainforest destruction, global warming and human rights abuses in countries such 
as Nigeria, Equador, Sudan and Indonesia. Our oil dependence also contributed to 
the war in Iraq. A war that has caused thousands of senseless deaths, further 
endangered our troops and weakened our nation's security all because of our 
dependence on foreign oil. It's time to kick the habit, stop unneccesary wars 
and bring our troops home.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Congress has failed to take 
meaningful action to address our oil dependence. Washington officials have 
repeatedly voted down even modest measures to increase the government's 
requirements on fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency loopholes for light trucks and 
SUVs remain in place, further enabling our gas guzzling. <br /><br />In the face of 
this Washington gridlock, citizens have few options but to take our desire 
directly to the automakers. It's time to take the <strong>&quot;No Blood for Oil&quot;</strong> 
slogan straight to Detroit. <br /><br /><strong>IT'S TIME TO TAKE ACTION <br /></strong><br />A 
movement is underway to pressure the auto industry to take responsibility for 
how its outdated vehicles fuel our oil addiction. Currently, grassroots action 
is centered on one company—Ford. <br /><br />Ford likes to say it is a company of 
&quot;environmental heroes,&quot; but in fact Ford is an environmental laggard. Ford has 
ranked dead last in fuel efficiency for the last 6 years. The company also 
reneged on a promise to increase the fuel efficiency of its SUV's. Ford cars and 
trucks account for approximately <strong>nine percent of the total annual U.S. oil 
consumption</strong>, and get fewer miles per gallon than they did 20 years ago. In 
fact, many Ford vehicles on the road today get fewer miles per gallon than did 
the Model-T 80 years ago! <br /><br />Ford has the technology and know-how to 
increase fuel economy to 50 mpg by 2010 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
to zero by 2020. But the company lacks the will to innovate. As a symbol of 
American entrepreneurship, Ford should commit to doing everything it can to 
break our addiction to oil.<br /><br /><strong>Join us on Saturday November 12 and Adopt
