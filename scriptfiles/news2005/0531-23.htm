<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">May 31, 2005—New York—MADRE, an international women’s human rights organization, has released an analysis of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a global initiative to end poverty and promote development by 2015. MADRE argues that while the MDGs offer some opportunities for improving the lives of women and families throughout the global South, they fall far short of what is needed to fully address the human rights and development crises confronting the world today. 

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The MDGs call for change, but not for creating the conditions to make real change possible.  To address the root causes of the problems that the goals are supposed to rectify, we need to grapple with precisely those phenomena that the MDGs take for granted.  These include policies that have increased poverty and inequality around the world (such as free-trade agreements, wage freezes, and hostility to worker organizing) and subordinated human rights to ‘national security’ as defined by the Bush Administration,” writes Yifat Susskind, MADRE’s Associate Director.
