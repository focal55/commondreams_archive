<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 14 -- In a significant policy shift, the Pentagon has sharply reduced its environmental duties, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). A new directive signed by outgoing Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz on March 19, 2005 confines Pentagon anti-pollution work only to activities that directly &#147;sustain the national defense mission.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This new &#147;Department of Defense Directive&#148; cancels a Clinton-era directive on &#147;Environmental Security.&#148; The new Directive trims a listing of Pentagon policy elements by eliminating provisions for &#151;</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Reducing risk to human health and the environment by identifying, evaluating, and where necessary, remediating contamination resulting from past DoD activities&#148;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Protecting, preserving, and, when required, restoring, and enhancing the quality of the environment&#148;; and</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Conserving, and restoring where necessary, the natural and cultural heritage represented on DoD installations within the United States.&#148;<br></font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an apparent concession to criticisms leveled when PEER posted a draft of the new policy in December, the final version was changed to add as policy &#147;to protect DoD personnel from accidental death, injury or occupational illness&#148; and &#147;to protect the public from risk of death, injury, illness, or property damage because of DoD activities.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;These changes show that protecting the public and even their own personnel from environmental threats is an afterthought,&#148; stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch. &#147;One additional change to the final policy is opening &#145;dialogue&#146; on environmental issues, which is ironic coming in a document that was developed in secret in the utter absence of dialogue.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new policy also significantly cuts Pentagon compliance with anti-pollution rules by dropping requirements that it obey &#147;regulations, Executive orders, binding international agreements&#148; and other federal &#147;environmental, safety, occupational health, explosives safety, fire and emergency services, and pest management policies.&#148; In its place, the Pentagon would pledge to only abide by &#147;applicable law and DoD policy.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In stripping away promises to improve or protect the environment, the new Directive instead says that the Pentagon &#147;will evaluate all activities&#133;and make prudent investments in initiatives that support mission accomplishment, enhance readiness, reduce future funding needs, prevent pollution, ensure cost effective compliance, and maximize the existing resource capability.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Despite having the worst pollution record on the planet, the Pentagon promises to self-regulate its environmental performance,&#148; added Ruch, pointing to the Pentagon&#146;s continuing efforts to exempt itself from an array of environmental laws. &#147;This new policy says that Pentagon agencies will do only the minimum pollution prevention and clean-up as required by its logistical and facility management needs.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Department of Defense directives define the agency&#146;s mission and responsibilities. By its terms, this Directive covers all &#147;DoD operations, activities, and installations worldwide, including Government-owned/contractor-operated facilities.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Read the new Pentagon &#147;Directive on Environment, Safety and Occupational Health&#148; <br><a href="https://www.denix.osd.mil/" target="_new">https://www.denix.osd.mil/</a> </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">See the former Clinton-era DoD Directive <br><a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d47151x.htm" target="_new">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d47151x.htm</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Look at the draft of the new policy posted by PEER in December 2004<br><a href="http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=447" target="_new">http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=447</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Review the Pentagon&#146;s Five-Year Plan to Exempt Itself from Environmental Laws<br><a href="http://www.peer.org/watch/federal_info.php?row_id=3" target="_new">http://www.peer.org/watch/federal_info.php?row_id=3</a> </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
