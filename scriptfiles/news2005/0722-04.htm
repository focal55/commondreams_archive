<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 22  -  On Saturday, July 23rd, members of Congress and activists around the country are organizing a day of action to call attention to the explosive evidence of government manipulation revealed in the Downing Street memo.  The day of action coincides with the 3rd anniversary of the controversial British intelligence minutes which verify that &quot;intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy&quot; to justify the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq.<br> <br>Some 300 events are planned that will include town hall meetings, dramatic readings of the memo and house parties. At least eight events will be hosted by or participated in by members of Congress. The goal of the events is to shine a light on the Downing Street Memo for the millions of Americans who still don't know of its existence. The events will also push for a Congressional resolution of inquiry-the first step in the impeachment process-into the Downing Street Memo and related documents. According to a recent Zogby poll, 42 percent of voters polled said they would support impeaching President Bush if it were established that he lied about his reasons for the Iraq war.<br> <br>&quot;It's unbelievable that millions of Americans still don't know about the existence of the Downing Street Memo, despite the fact that its contents are so controversial that they could provide grounds for the impeachment of the President of the United States,&quot; said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Global Exchange and CodePink: Women for Peace, two groups that are involved with the After Downing Street Coalition, which spurred the organization of the July 23 Downing Street Memo events.<br> <br>For a complete list of July 23 Downing Street Memo events, go to <a href="http://hq.demaction.org/dia/organizations/ADS/event/distributedEventSearch.jsp?distributed_event_KEY=56" target="_new">http://hq.demaction.org/dia/organizations/ADS/event/distributedEventSearch.jsp?distributed_event_KEY=56</a>. Featured events include a Town Hall Meeting with Representative John Conyers at Wayne State University's Law School Auditorium at 2 PM, and a Town Hall Meeting with Representative Barbara Lee at the Grand Lake Theatre in Oakland at 11 AM. Other members of Congress participating in public events include Congressman Jim McDermott, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, former Congresswoman Liz Holtzman, Congressman Maurice Hinchey, Congressman Zavier Becerra, Congressman Barney Frank, and Congressman Charles Rangel. House party attendees will be able to participate in a conference call with Representative Conyers and former ambassador Joseph Wilson. Bloggers around the country will report live on events from www.afterdowningstreet.org.</font><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
