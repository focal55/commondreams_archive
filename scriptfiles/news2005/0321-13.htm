<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 21 -- The parties to several lawsuits related to Unocal&#146;s energy investment in the Yadana gas pipeline project in Myanmar/Burma announced today that they have settled their suits.  Although the terms are confidential, the settlement will compensate plaintiffs and provide funds enabling plaintiffs and their representatives to develop programs to improve living conditions, health care and education and protect the rights of people from the pipeline region.  These initiatives will provide substantial assistance to people who may have suffered hardships in the region.  Unocal reaffirms its principle that the company respects human rights in all of its activities and commits to enhance its educational programs to further this principle.  Plaintiffs and their representatives reaffirm their commitment to protecting human rights.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jennie Green, CCR Senior Attorney and counsel in Doe v. Unocal, commented, &quot;After over eight years of litigation, we are so happy for our plaintiffs, and for the others who will benefit from this settlement.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
