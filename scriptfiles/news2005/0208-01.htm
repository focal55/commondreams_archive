<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 8 -- Sarah Neimeyer, the former director of federal-state relations for Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle, has been selected as The Wilderness Society&#146;s new director of budget and appropriations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are very excited to have Sarah on board, especially as the annual budget season begins,&#148; said William H. Meadows, president of The Wilderness Society. &#147;The budget is under more pressure than ever because of the mounting deficit, so we need to do everything we can to ensure that environmental protection is not underfunded. Sarah brings a great deal of Capitol Hill experience, and we expect her to be an effective member of the conservation coalition.&#148; Neimeyer replaces Bonnie Galvin, who recently moved to Geneva, Switzerland.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neimeyer spent the last couple of years in the Washington office of Governor Jim Doyle, promoting Wisconsin&#146;s needs at federal agencies and in Congress, working extensively on budget and appropriations. She had been the senior legislative assistant for U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), specializing in the budget and appropriations; account executive for the political consulting firm Campaign Performance Group; and office manager for Martin &amp; Glantz, a national grassroots organizing political consulting firm. Previously Neimeyer served on the staffs of former Congressmen Charles Schumer (D-NY) and John LaFalce (D-NY). She has a B.A. in international relations from the University of Minnesota.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am looking forward to working with such a great team, both at The Wilderness Society and with the greater environmental advocacy community in Washington, DC,&#148; said Neimeyer. &#147;Joining The Wilderness Society will give me the opportunity to combine my early experience as a camper and canoe guide in the Boundary Waters and Quetico Park with my love of the legislative and congressional process to advocate protection of the lands that belong to all Americans.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in January 1935 by Aldo Leopold, Bob Marshall, and six other visionaries, The Wilderness Society is celebrating its 70th anniversary. The nonprofit, which has a quarter million members and supporters, is dedicated to protecting America&#146;s wilderness and to developing a nationwide network of wildlands through public education, scientific analysis, and advocacy.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
