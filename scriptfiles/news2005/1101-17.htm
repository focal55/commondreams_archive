<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - “We hope that today’s decision to have another judge preside over Tom DeLay’s trial for money laundering means that the process to end DeLay’s corruption can move ahead swiftly. 

 

<p>“MoveOn has been a leading organization in the fight against political corruption. Tom DeLay is one of the most corrupt politicians in Washington. He’s been charged with being the mastermind in a scheme to use the Republican National Committee to channel illegal corporate campaign contributions to Texas legislators. That’s why he’s on trial.

 

<p>“The Congressman wanted to change the subject by drawing MoveOn’s 3.3 million members into this case. To be clear, Judge Perkins made his contribution to our organization long before we began our campaign against Mr. DeLay’s corrupt fundraising practices.

 

<p>“Now that the issue of who will hear the case has been settled, we hope the judicial system will be allowed to focus on the issue of his alleged crimes. 

 

<p>“We, too, are concerned about bias--in particular the effect of the $27 million dollars Tom DeLay raised from tobacco, gas and oil companies, and other special interests.

 

<p>“We hope that Mr. DeLay’s trial will help end the ongoing scandal of political fundraising in Washington which has soured so many Americans on the political process.”
