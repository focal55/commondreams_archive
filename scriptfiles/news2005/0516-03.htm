<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 16 -- NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation's leading advocate of personal privacy and a woman's right to choose, activated a national campaign in targeted states to link Americans directly with their senators to urge them to oppose the &quot;nuclear option,&quot; an effort by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist to radically restructure the nation's courts.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The majority of Americans know the 'nuclear option' is a dangerous power grab by the far right designed to clear the path for President George W. Bush's most divisive anti-choice judicial nominees. We're pulling out all the stops in our efforts to disarm the 'nuclear option.' This vote could come down to a handful of senators, and we're making sure that they hear from their constituents,&quot; said Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. &quot;Reducing the Senate to a rubber stamp for President Bush's ultra-conservative judicial nominees is a terrifying prospect. Americans expect far more from their elected officials.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The patch-through calls target Republican Senators in 12 states. Approximately 430,000 activists received a call from NARAL Pro-Choice America&#146;s president, Nancy Keenan, allowing the activists to be &#147;patched-through&#148; directly to their Senator&#146;s office. The calls are part of NARAL Pro-Choice America&#146;s &quot;Choose Justice&quot; campaign. NARAL Pro-Choice America has mobilized its volunteer base in every part of the country and generated 100,000 petition signatures to senators urging them to oppose the &quot;nuclear option.&quot; </font> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
