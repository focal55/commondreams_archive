<p>New York - November 8 – In celebration of the 24th annual World Food Day, Action Against Hunger will host a benefit gala honoring Archbishop Desmond Tutu for his outstanding work against hunger, malnutrition, and poverty worldwide. The event will take place at the Metropolitan Club of New York City on Friday, November 11, 2005.

<p>Action Against Hunger presents its World Food Day Humanitarian Award each year to someone who has made a significant contribution to the struggle to end world hunger. 

<p>“Throughout his career, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has worked not only for political equality, but also for the fulfillment of basic human needs such as clean water, adequate food, and health care,” said Cathy Skoula, Executive Director of Action Against Hunger. “We are proud to present our award to this esteemed advocate for humanity.” 

<p>The award will be presented by Terry George, Academy Award Nominee, Producer, Director, and Screenwriter of Hotel Rwanda. Angelique Kidjo, Grammy Award Nominee, will also be present to give a performance.

<p>Past recipients of the award include former South African President Nelson Mandela; Professor Michael Golden and Dr. Yvonne Grellety for their roles in inventing the therapeutic milk formula F100, a revolutionary life-saving formula to cure malnutrition, now the standard for relief organizations worldwide; Pulitzer Prize–winning author Frank McCourt; and actor Jeff Bridges.

<p>The evening boasts an exciting and unique menu, prepared by some of New York's top chefs, who are volunteering their services for the evening. The hors d'oeuvres are the responsibility of Ariane Daguin of D'Artagnan and Karl Schmid of The Metropolitan Club; the first course will be prepared by Andrew Gold of The Institute of Culinary Education; the main course will be the focus of Cornelius Gallagher of Oceana; and dessert will be done by Deborah Snyder of The Lever House.

<p>This year Action Against Hunger expects more than 350 people to attend the gala, raising more than $300,000 for the organization’s work, including relief programs in earthquake-devastated Pakistan. 

<p>World Food Day is a United Nations-designated day observed worldwide to mark the founding of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization on October 16, 1945. World Food Day encourages all sectors of society to increase awareness, understanding, and year-round action toward the eradication of hunger.

<p>The 2005 World Food Day Gala will take place on November 11, at the Metropolitan Club, 1 East 60th Street, New York City beginning with a cocktail hour at 6:30 p.m., followed by dinner at 7:30.

<p>Action Against Hunger is a nonprofit organization providing immediate assistance and long-term relief to the victims of manmade and natural disasters. Action Against Hunger has been a world leader in the treatment of malnutrition since 1979, and has programs that focus on nutrition, food security, water and sanitation, and basic health in more than 44 countries around the world.
