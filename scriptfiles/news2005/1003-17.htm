<p>WASHINGTON - Lobby Day on Sept. 26th was the largest lobby day for peace that many
long-time organizers have ever seen! Almost 1000 grassroots activists
met with over 300 Senators, Representatives and their staff to demand
they take action to end the war. The pressure from the weekend's
activities, including the Lobby Day, moved some congresspersons in the
right direction. You can help us move more by making a phone call (and
sending an email) to your Senators today. </p>
<p>The Senate is poised to vote yes on Wednesday to another $50 billion for the Iraq war. This money is being included as part of a $441 billion defense spending bill.


<p>Call your Senators and demand they stop funding the war. Tell them to vote NO on the defense spending bills.

<p>The Capitol Switchboard is 202-224-3121. Ask to be connected to your Senator's office. (Make two calls, one to each Senator.) If you can't remember your Senator's name, just tell the operator what state you live in and they will connect you to the correct office.

<p>In addition to calling your Senators, send an email to their offices by clicking here: <a href="http://www.demaction.org/dia/organizations/ufpj/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=1314">http://www.demaction.org/dia/organizations/ufpj/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=1314</a><p>We have no illusions that the Senate will have the courage to stop funding the war this week, but it's vital that they face escalating pressure until they stop supporting the war.
