<p>WASHINGTON - November 18 - Republican congressional leadership and the Bush administration again revealed their skewed priorities by slashing vital programs that support working families while promoting tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. 

<p>While congressional leaders were working in the dark of night to eke out enough votes to pass the House Reconciliation bill that includes draconian cuts in working family programs, the Bush administration continued its push to pass a whopping $70 billion dollars in tax breaks for the wealthy. 

<p>With the deficit mounting and working families increasingly squeezed by mounting cuts to health care, student loan programs and food assistance, it’s clear that that the administration and its congressional allies are completely out of touch with mainstream America.

<p>Congress must reject any budget that cuts programs supporting working families and the poor to make room for yet another round of huge tax breaks for the rich.
