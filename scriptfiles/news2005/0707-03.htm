<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SEATTLE -  July 7 - Shared Strategy will officially submit the Draft Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan to NOAA Fisheries at a ceremony today in Seattle.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rob Masonis, senior director of the Northwest regional office of American Rivers made the following statement.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We applaud the effort and vision that went into crafting this plan. If we are to preserve our natural heritage and Northwest way of life, and if we want to leave a legacy we can be proud of for future generations, we must recover Puget Sound&#146;s wild salmon and steelhead.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While it is appropriate to celebrate today, we must not forget that hard work lies ahead. Whether or not the plan will translate to real actions on the ground has yet to be seen. Without effective implementation the document will be of little value, and effective implementation will require the commitment and cooperation of diverse interests. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Decisions at the local level will help determine whether the recovery plan is successful. Many Puget Sound counties are in the process of updating their local zoning regulations, known as Critical Areas Ordinances, that protect rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands. Strong, science-based CAOs will be essential to achieving the habitat protection called for in the recovery plan, and will also have the added benefit of preventing flood damage, protecting property, and keeping our water clean.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While the recovery plan represents significant progress, there are gaps. The critical issue of stream flow is barely addressed in individual watershed plans, yet  wild salmon and steelhead must have sufficient water to survive.  If we want to see real recovery, we must identify stream flow problems in each watershed, and  set and achieve protective stream flows. Reducing water consumption through better irrigation and landscaping practices, using more efficient appliances, capturing rainwater,  and reusing water are important measures that will help keep water in our rivers and streams..</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;American Rivers looks forward to assisting communities and citizens in Puget Sound take the necessary actions so that we can enjoy healthy rivers and healthy, fishable populations of wild salmon and steelhead for years to come.&#148;</font></p><p><br></p><p></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
