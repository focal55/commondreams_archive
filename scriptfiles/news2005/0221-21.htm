<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRUSSELS (BELGIUM) -- February 21 --The United States must take 
urgent action to combat climate change, Friends of the Earth 
International said today.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The call follows President Bush's apparent recognition of the need to 
tackle global warming in a speech in Brussels today.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr Bush spoke of the need to "show good stewardship of the earth - and 
that requires addressing the serious, long-term challenge of global 
climate change."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He spoke of emerging technologies and said that "all nations, including 
the developing countries can advance economically, while slowing the 
growth in global greenhouse and avoid pollutants that undermine public 
health".

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth International said that the US - the world's 
biggest polluter - must accept that we need to do far more than "slowing 
the growth" of greenhouse gases, and called on the US to commit itself 
to join the rest of the world in tackling global warming by pledging 
itself to a significant reduction in carbon dioxide levels [1].

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth International climate campaigner Catherine Pearce said:

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Now that President Bush appears to accept the need to tackle climate 
change, there can be no excuse for US inaction on this issue. The United 
States, the world's biggest polluter, must join the rest of the world in 
tackling this problem. And that means making significant cuts in US 
emissions. Unless the US takes action, a new era of transatlantic unity 
cannot begin."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The evidence that climate change is proceeding apace is piling up and 
weather extremes across the planet are increasing, both in frequency and 
intensity. A recent high-level international taskforce "Meeting the 
Climate Challenge" has revealed that global emissions have to peak by as 
early as 2015 in order to avoid uncontrollable climate change.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>President Bush pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, arguing that US business interests would be harmed by the treaty. The United States is responsible for a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide emissions (the principal greenhouse gas), yet it only has around four per cent of the world's population.</i></font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
