<p>WASHINGTON - December 20 - The American Civil Liberties Union today, along with a broad 
coalition of sexual assault groups, religious leaders, and women&#8217;s health 
advocates, criticized the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s refusal to release 
records pertaining to the department&#8217;s failure to include any reference to 
emergency contraception in the first-ever national protocol for treating sexual 
assault victims. 
<p>The government&#8217;s refusal to turn over documents that could shed light on why 
the national protocol fails to include essential information on preventing 
pregnancy begs the question, &#8216;What are they trying to hide?&#8217;&#8221; said Louise 
Melling, Director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Research shows that if emergency facilities routinely provide emergency 
contraception to rape victims, up to 22,000 of the 25,000 pregnancies that 
result from rape each year could be prevented.&nbsp; Nevertheless, late last 
year, the Department of Justice released the first-ever national protocol for 
treating sexual assault victims and failed to mention emergency contraception or 
recommend that it be routinely offered to women who have been raped.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In August of this year, following news reports that information about 
pregnancy prevention and emergency contraception was removed from the final 
protocol, the ACLU, on behalf of a broad coalition, sent a Freedom of 
Information Act request asking the Justice Department to provide records 
pertaining to the removal of the information. </P>
<P>Instead of providing earlier drafts of the protocol and other responsive 
materials, the Justice Department sent the ACLU a set of documents used to help 
develop a preliminary national protocol, including treatment recommendations 
from the American College of Emergency Physicians, several state protocols, and 
a copy of an article on forensic evidence collection.&nbsp; All of these 
documents, unlike the national protocol, discuss pregnancy prevention in 
detail.&nbsp; Most either provide instructions for prescribing emergency 
contraception or specifically recommend that emergency contraception be offered 
to rape victims.</P>
<P>&#8220;Clearly, the Justice Department reviewed documents highlighting the 
importance of helping sexual assault victims prevent pregnancy,&#8221; said 
Melling.&nbsp; &#8220;In light of this evidence, it is troubling that the protocols 
remain silent on the issue and fail to protect women.&#8221; </P>
<P>In its request, the ACLU represented a coalition of groups, including 
Christians for Justice Action, Family Planning Advocates of New York State, 
MergerWatch, Montana Coalition Against Domestic Violence &amp; Sexual Assault, 
NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Council of Jewish Women, and Planned 
Parenthood Federation of America, among others.</P>
<P>Emergency contraception, often referred to as &#8220;the morning-after pill,&#8221; 
reduces the risk of pregnancy by as much as 89 percent if the first dose is 
taken within days of unprotected intercourse, but it is more effective the 
sooner it is taken.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Samples of relevant portions of the documents provided by the Justice 
Department are available online at <A class=noline_blue href="/reproductiverights/religion/23118lgl20051220.html" target=_blank>www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/religion/23118lgl20051220.html.</A>

emergency contraception, visit <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.raisinghervoice.org/" target=_blank>www.RaisingHerVoice.org</A>, a project of
