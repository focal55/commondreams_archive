<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005, introduced today in the House of 
 Representatives and the U.S. Senate, would give low-income working 
 Americans their first wage increase in 8 years.
 
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During that time, the members of the Congress have voted to give 
 themselves salary increases of almost $30,000; but they refuse to give 
 the working poor an increase a in the federal minimum wage.
 
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the average hourly earnings of America's manufacturing work 
 force have increased from $12.50 in 1997 to $15.80 in 2005, minimum 
 wage workers - doing responsible and important jobs like day care, 
 nursing home care, teaching assistants - have been stuck at 
 $5.15/hour.
 
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Additionally, the value of the minimum wage is at its second lowest 
 level in the last 45 years. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005 would 
 increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25/hour by 2007.clearly, by 
 any standard, a modest increase over a reasonable period of time.  
 Such an increase would help approximately 7 million working Americans 
 feed their families, pay their rent, or continue their schooling.
 
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And, in spite of all the rhetoric from business interests who 
 reflexively oppose increasing the minimum wage, never in the history of minimum wage increases - a period of 67 years - has anyone or any statistic been able to show economic damage from modest,
periodic increases in the minimum wage.                   
 
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Campaign for a Fair Minimum Wage, a project of Americans for 
 Democratic Action (ADA), is a coalition of church, labor, and social 
 welfare organizations whose public policy agendas include support for 
 an overdue increase in the federal minimum wage. With more than 200 organizations in its ranks, the Campaign supports the efforts of Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Congressman George Miller (D-CA), chief sponsors of the minimum wage legislation,  to bring a tangible benefit to the families of lower wage working
 Americans.   
 
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Without the passage of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005, minimum wage 
 workers will fall further and further down the income scale; with each 
 passing year, the purchasing power of the $5.15/hour minimum wage 
 declines.  Failure to pass this legislation in this Congress would 
 condemn a large segment of the working population to a continuing 
 decline in their living standard.
 
</font><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Congress must ask itself: how long can we as a society support 
 the reality of people who work hard every day earning a wage that 
 keeps them in poverty?" decried Jane O'Grady, Executive Director.
