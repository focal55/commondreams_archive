<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 - As the IMF and World Bank prepare for their annual meetings in Washington, DC this weekend where they will consider the agreement reached by the G-8 in July on debt cancellation, Jubilee USA Network, the US arm of the global Jubilee movement, today condemned moves at both institutions to weaken the G-8 debt agreement. 
 
<p>Leaked documents obtained by Jubilee USA and reports from the US and UK have highlighted challenges to the deal by some European governments and World Bank staff. Specifically, these proposals would undermine the G-8 principle of 100% irrevocable debt stock cancellation for 18 impoverished countries and would add more economic conditionalities. African Executive Directors at the IMF have opposed such moves to water down the deal.

<p>“The G-8 made a promise this summer that some of the world’s poorest nations would see their debts to the IMF and World Bank totally and irrevocably erased. Now some governments and the World Bank are trying to take that promise back. That is unacceptable,” said Neil Watkins, National Coordinator of Jubilee USA Network. “The IMF/World Bank must agree to full debt cancellation this weekend. But this will only be a first step towards our broader goal of expanding debt cancellation to all impoverished countries, without devastating economic conditions, in the months and years ahead.”

<p>Jubilee USA Network has characterized the G-8 deal on debt cancellation as an important and precedent-setting first step, but one that falls short of what is needed to conclusively end the debt crisis faced by the world’s impoverished nations. 

<p>Any backtracking on the G-8 deal would result in serious consequences for those populations in the 18 initially eligible countries that urgently require the resources released through full debt cancellation. As an example, the presidents of Rwanda and Zambia – eligible countries – have called for the IMF and World Bank to immediately cancel their debts. Yet, current discussions at the institutions’ boards have set the G-8 deal’s implementation date at July 2006. This would continue to prevent the Zambian government from providing additional AIDS drugs to almost 100,000 infected people, an initiative the government announced in response to the G-8 agreement.
 
<p>Jubilee USA Network’s analysis of the G-8 debt agreement,  “First Step on A Long Journey: Putting the G-8 Deal on Debt into Perspective,” highlights the benefits of the G-8 debt agreement, while detailing its shortcomings, and provides recommendations of next steps. The report and executive summary are available at www.jubileeusa.org.
