<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 18 -- Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) today announced the selection of the organization's new executive director, Jody Michael Huckaby. This announcement concludes a six-month search process by PFLAG's search committee, who reviewed the qualifications of more than sixty applicants.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Under Jody's leadership, we know PFLAG will grow and prosper as an outstanding advocate of equality for our GLBT family members and loved ones,&quot; said Samuel Thoron, PFLAG's President. &quot;In addition to his extensive qualifications, Jody brings a passionate commitment to our values, vision and mission.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last 14 years, Huckaby has served as Executive Director of New Mexico AIDS Services, Inc., Bering Community Service Foundation and, most recently, the Washington Humane Society. Huckaby begins serving as executive director of PFLAG in early March.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huckaby is the seventh of eight children and grew up in a small town in Louisiana. He is gay and has three gay brothers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am honored to become a part of the PFLAG family,&quot; said Huckaby. &quot;With its 30 year history, PFLAG is the unique family voice on GLBT issues. Having been raised in a large family in a small town in southwestern Louisiana, I know the challenges that families can face when coping with sexual orientation and gender identity. My family didn't have the resources of PFLAG to help us back then. But today more than 500 PFLAG chapters across the country are essential in helping to end discrimination and achieve equality for everyone, regardless of our sexual orientation or gender identity. I am very excited about working with PFLAG to help fulfill its critical mission.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) is the nation's foremost family-based organization committed to the civil rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender persons.
