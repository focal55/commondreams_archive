<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 25 - Pride at Work expresses dismay over Supreme Court nominee John Roberts. Passing a resolution on July 24th, 2005, we encourage our legislators not to appoint John Roberts to the Supreme Court. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roberts, as Sandra Day O'Connor's replacement, would be the deciding vote on matters of individual rights for decades to come. His nomination could deny fairness to women and other vulnerable communities. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups, the women's rights movement, constitutional and anti-corporate activists have weighed in on Roberts. All groups, including Pride at Work (PAW), urge the nomination of a fair justice. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Freedom and choice are valued American ideals,&quot; said PAW co-president Josh Cazares. &quot;Roberts' record of curtailing choice, women's liberties and individual rights shows disregard for consensus and impartiality. We should all be spurred to action.&quot; Alluding to Roberts' record of anti-choice rulings, Cazares also anti-worker bent of Roberts' decisions. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roberts currently serves on the Legal Advisory Council of the National Legal Center for Public Interest (NLCPI). The mission statement of the NLCPI includes, &quot;free enterprise, private ownership of property, balanced use of private and public resources, limited government, and a fair and efficient judiciary.&quot; This statement can be interpreted as hostile towards worker protections. Further, Robert was formerly employed with Hogan and Hartson, LLP -- the &quot;go to law firm for union busting.&quot; His record shows that he does not support the organized labor or the rights of the worker. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender constituency group of the AFL-CIO, PAW has a deep interest in workers' and human rights. Therefore, we demand a nominee able to separate personal conviction from judicial rule. Roberts' record shows an anti-choice, anti-worker, anti-democratic pattern. We resolutely demand fairness on our courts! Tell your legislators that we demand a nominee, fair and impartial. Spur to action! Write or call your senators today. Tell them that the American public deserves a justice with the character and fortitude of fairness and impartiality.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
