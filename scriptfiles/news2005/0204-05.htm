<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 3, 2005 -- Today the Interfaith Alliance called upon President Bush to apologize to the world and to honorable US military officers because of the egregious statement by Lt. General James Mattis.  "General Mattis desecrated the honor of military professionals who are asked to protect us by his unprofessional glorification of killing in battle," said TIA President Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy.  "We call upon President Bush to promptly and severely reprimand General Mattis."

<P>Lt. Gen. James Mattis, who commanded Marine expeditions in Afghanistan and Iraq, made the comments Tuesday during a panel discussion in San Diego, California. 

<P>"Actually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot," Mattis said, prompting laughter from some military members in the audience. "It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling. 

<P>"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil," Mattis said. "You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them."

<P>Interfaith Alliance board member Rabbi Jack Moline said "As an interfaith community, we are concerned by the underlying bigotry revealed by Gen. Mattis' remarks.  In spite of assurances to the contrary, we do not seem to be fostering respect for Muslim people as we battle against our opponents."

<P>This is only the most recent verbal outrage from a high ranking military officer. 

<P>In late fall 2003, The Interfaith Alliance called upon President Bush to reprimand General William Boykin. General Boykin had made religiously prejudicial statements about the superiority of his Christian religious beliefs over Islam. General Boykin made his statements while in his U.S. Army uniform in evangelical Christian congregations.  General Boykin has remained a senior officer in the Pentagon.</p></font><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><div align="CENTER"></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
