<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 15 --  Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on the Administration's request for an additional $82 billion mostly for the war in Iraq:</font></p><p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress should reject the Administration's latest request. From day one, this Administration has misled the public and the Congress about this war. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We were told there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, there were none. We were told we would be greeted as liberators, we were not. We were told Iraq reconstruction would pay for itself, it has not. And, we were told the Administration had a plan to win the peace in Iraq, they do not. <br>	<br>	&quot;The Administration's entire case for the war has now been debunked, Iraq is on the verge of a civil war, and the Administration still refuses to admit any mistakes. American troops and American taxpayers are footing the bill for a war that was never needed, and a war that is counterproductive to the security interests of our nation.</font></p><p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress should not serve as a rubber stamp of this Administration's failed policies.  Congress should reject this Supplemental request, along with the Administration's failed policy in Iraq, and work to bring our soldiers home.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
