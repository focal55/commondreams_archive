<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHICAGO -- February 18 -- The following commentary was released today by BuzzFlash.com:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's see: last week's BuzzFlash GOP Hypocrite of the Week, Howard Kurtz, was connected to the prior week's Hypocrite, Jeff Gannon/Guckert, and this week's honoree is connected to both of them.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, we're not implying that the sartorial CNN star, Wolf Blitzer, had a military studs' romp with Gannon/Guckert while on a &quot;date&quot; to view the moonlit Iwo Jima War Memorial. But boy, Blitzer sure joined Kurtz in going out of their way to make Gannon/Guckert appear to be a victim of an overzealous mob of Internet bloggers and websites like, well, BuzzFlash.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blitzer, ever the polite one when dealing with a sensitive issue that might blow up in the face of the White House, had Gannon/Guckert on his CNN program. What was Wolf's first question? How about, &quot;Should I call you Jim or Jeff?&quot; And from there the questions got even more soft ball for the GOP shill by day, gay military hooker by night.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You see, Wolf's job is not to analyze the news, it's to accomplish two things for CNN: First, to make sure no hair is out of place on his beard; and second, to protect the White House's flanks at all costs or lose his fat paycheck and D.C. status.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week we wrote: &quot;...anyone with half a brain cell realizes that Kurtz's comments are simply damage control bullet points from or for the White House. The blogging world did what the lackey mainstream press will no longer do, expose a story that is at the epicenter of the deceit and propaganda media campaign central to how the Bush Cartel continues to control America.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyone want to loan Blitzer half a brain cell? He seems to be missing his.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actually, Blitzer's no dummy. He just knows that his job is to do public relations for the Bush administration, not pursue any ethical standards in journalism. What do credentials matter when you spend your on-air time trying to cover up the truth rather than exposing it?</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only Wolf knows, our BuzzFlash GOP Hypocrite of the Week.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
