<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- The following is a statement by Keith Ashdown, Vice President of Policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense on H.R. 3 - Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The transportation bill that was approved today is leading us down the road of fiscal ruin. It contains thousands of earmarks requested by virtually every lawmaker in Congress, many of which do very little to alleviate congestion or assist in rebuilding the nation's crumbling road infrastructure. The 1,132 page bill contains 4,128 political earmarks for almost every member of Congress for a total cost of $12.4 billion. The fact that these projects are concentrated in the hands of a few powerful members of Congress only underscores the fact that transportation pork is bad transportation policy, and terrible fiscal policy. This highway bill represents the &quot;everything and the kitchen sink,&quot; approach to crafting legislation. Instead of tightening their fiscal belt, Congress had instead decided to fund horse trails, museums, interpretive centers, and water taxis. In short, Congress is suffering from a form of budgetary amnesia. Just weeks ago, lawmakers were talking about the need for fiscal restraint, but in this first chance to follow through, they ended up breaking the bank.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The transportation bill is a pork laden budget buster that needs a serious overhaul. Instead of cutting spending in a fiscally responsible manner, lawmakers are committing highway robbery on taxpayers to pay for parochial pork.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>A listing of all earmarks in the legislation, including the manager's amendment, will be available at <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/" target="_new">http://www.taxpayer.net</a> at 4:30 p.m. today </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
