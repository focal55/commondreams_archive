<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- April 6 -- Today in New York City, activists will protest at the New York headquarters of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), calling on the bank to sever its relationship as financial advisor to Sakhalin II, a Shell-led oil and gas mega-project in Russia that independent scientists believe may push the last 100 Western Pacific Gray Whales to extinction.  The demonstration follows a community uprising by Sakhalin Island residents yesterday and simultaneous solidarity action at CSFB headquarters in Z&uuml;rich.<br> <br>At noon today, Sakhalin II specialist Doug Norlen, policy director of Pacific Environment, will lead a team of U.S.-based activists to CSFB headquarters in New York and deliver a message to bank executives from indigenous communities and independent scientists.  Activists with banners reading &#147;GOOD BANKS DON&#146;T KILL WHALES,&#148; OIL IN SAKHALIN: INVESTMENT OF MASS DESTRUCTION,&#148; and &#147;OIL KILLS. CSFB PROFITS&#148; will demonstrate at the entrance to 11 Madison Avenue and educate bank employees and visitors about the irreparable environmental and social damage that Sakhalin II will cause if funded.<br> <br>With support from BANKTrack, Berne Declaration, Greenpeace Switzerland, Pacific Environment, Platform, Sakhalin Environment Watch and Rainforest Action Network, civil society will remind CSFB and the banking community that Sakhalin II is in direct violation of the Equator Principles, standards it has adopted along with 28 other private financial institutions.<br> <br>Credit Suisse First Boston and Shell&#146;s Sakhalin II</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CSFB is the lead financial advisor to Shell, the majority shareholder in the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, a limited liability corporation registered in Bermuda.  According to Project Finance magazine, the $12 billion Sakhalin II project is &#147;the biggest single integrated oil and gas project ever undertaken.&#148;  The highly controversial mega-project includes plans for two oil platforms located near the only known feeding ground of the critically endangered Western Pacific Gray Whale.<br> <br>If the project proceeds as planned, toxic oil will move from offshore platforms through an earthquake zone and down and 800-kilometer pipeline that crosses 24 active seismic faults and more than 200 wild salmon spawning rivers and tributaries.  New photographs leaked to Sakhalin Environment Watch by project-insiders reveal gross violations of Russian law.  Reckless pipeline construction slashes through forest ecosystems and destroys pristine wild salmon spawning streams and tributaries in its path.  (Rights free photographs available upon request.)<br> <br>As Shell announced last week an insufficient plan to reroute its dangerous pipeline, Sakhalin islanders discovered a huge amount of debris apparently dumped by project sub-contractor in a shallow bay crucial to the island&#146;s vital fisheries. Local divers reported that debris is smothering spawning grounds for crab and scallops, causing a local outcry.  Healthy fisheries are vital to the local economy.<br> <br>Shell has failed to conduct the required Indigenous Peoples&#146; and Cultural Heritage Plans prescribed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Safeguard Policies, the basis for the Equator Principle guidelines for managing environmental and social issues in project finance lending.  In January of this year, indigenous residents endured minus 30-degree temperatures to peacefully blockade the Sakhalin II mega- project and protest the negative impact the it will have on their lives and livelihoods.<br> <br>Despite obvious violations, Credit Suisse Group stated in a March 24 letter to Bern Declaration and Greenpeace Switzerland, &#147;We believe that appropriate measures have been defined such as to limit any significant adverse effects the Project may have on the environment.&#148; <br> <br>Western Pacific Gray Whales</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to &#147;Impacts of Sakhalin II Phase 2 on Western Pacific Gray Whales and Related Biodiversity,&#148; a report by The World Conservation Union (IUCN) release in February, &#147;the most precautionary approach would be to suspend present operations and delay further development of the oil and gas reserves in the vicinity of the gray whale feeding grounds off Sakhalin, and especially the critical nearshore feeding ground that is used preferentially by mothers and calves.&#148;  The report states, &#147;The small population of western gray whales, numbering only about 100 animals, is on the edge of survival. It was reduced to such low numbers by commercial whaling that in the mid 20th century it was thought to be extinct. The population is listed by IUCN &#150; The World Conservation Union as &#145;critically endangered&#146; and also has been the focus of concern by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and the 3rd World Conservation Congress. The few surviving animals (possibly including only 23 reproductively active females) face a number of hazards throughout their range.&#148;  A complete copy of the report can be found at www.iucn.org.<br> <br>Market and legal response</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leading socially responsible blue-chip investment funds such as Investec Henderson Crosthwaite and Morley Fund have already sold all their Shell shares over concerns about the oil giant&#146;s lack of environmental ethics in its activities including those off the Sakhalin Island.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has ruled that Sakhalin Energy&#146;s environmental impact assessments are &#147;unfit for purpose.&#148;  The Moscow-based legal center Rodnik filed a lawsuit in 2004 to stop the implementation of Sakhalin II on the grounds that it violates Russian environmental code, which stipulates that any activities harmful to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species should be stopped.<br> <br>Supporting statements<br> <br>&#147;Sakhalin II is an environmental time bomb,&#148; said Ilyse Hogue, director the Global Finance Campaign at Rainforest action Network.  &#147;Sakhalin II is a case of radical resource extraction from a rare marine ecosystem, and Shell is understating Sakhalin&#146;s environmental destruction and overstating its economic benefit to local communities. The environmental community condemns the Shell-led cartel for its reckless disregard of the precautionary principle in this clear-cut case of business choosing oil over life. Shell is blatantly ignoring the recommendation of independent scientific experts, and Credit Suisse First Boston has no other ethical choice but to completely withdraw support and assistance for Sakhalin II, a project that even fails to meet the most basic standards set the Equator Principles.&#148;<br> <br>&#147;Shell&#146;s scofflaw approach on Sakhalin II taints the reputation of all banks associated the project,&#148; said Doug Norlen, policy director for Pacific Environment. &#147;Credit Suisse First Boston should not be an accessory to fisheries destruction and species extinction.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>BANKTrack</b></i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BankTrack (<a href="http://www.BANKTrack.org/" target="_new">BANKTrack.org</a>) is a network of fourteen civil society organisations tracking the operations of the private financial sector and its effect on people and the environment.
