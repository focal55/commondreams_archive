<p>WASHINGTON - December 29 - Help us stop Sen. Frist and others from padding drug industry profits

      <p>Republicans are exploiting anxieties about avian flu to quietly pass 
        
        legislation that shields the drug industry from being held legally accountable 
        
        when flu vaccines and other pharmaceuticals used to treat pandemic diseases 
        
        cause death, disability or serious sickness. (Majority Leader Frist has 
        
        attached it as a provision in a completely unrelated defense spending 
        bill, 
hoping no one will notice!)</p>
      <p>Update: The vote has already taken place. Shamefully, Congress put corporate 
        
        interests above the public interest and passed this unsafe, unfair, and 
        
        unnecessary legislation. 
        Thank you for your efforts in helping to stop the drug industry giveaway. 
</p>
      <p>We plan to take action at the start of the new year, and will need your 
        help 
        to convince members of Congress that they made the wrong decision. </p>
      <p>Until then, we encourage you to use the <a href="http://action.citizen.org/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=1687&track=AvianCitizenOrg">space below</a> to send a personal 
        note to 
        your member of Congress expressing your disappointment in the passage 
        of this 
        legislation. 
</p>
      <p>If you have time, please also call or visit the district offices of your 
        
        Senators and Representative during the recess to express your opinion 
        on this 
        legislation.

Bill to shield vaccinemakers raises alarms<br>
        By Gregory M. Lamb | The Christian Science Monitor <br>
        A measure to shield drug manufacturers from lawsuits in an effort to encourage 
        
        them to develop new vaccines is likely to be quietly attached to a &quot;must 
        pass&quot;        defense appropriation bill within the next few days. <br>
