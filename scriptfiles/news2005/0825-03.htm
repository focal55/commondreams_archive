<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 25 - Several prominent figures in the African American community today strongly rebuked Mychal Massie and other right-wing African Americans for comparing Supreme Court nominee John Roberts, who has a record of opposition to civil rights, to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

 

<p>In a press release from the right-wing front group Project 21 announcing an event scheduled for this morning, Massie said Roberts “represents the beliefs of great Americans such as James Madison and Martin Luther King, Jr.”

 

<p>But Roberts’ record clearly shows he tried to limit voting rights protections, permit federal funding of discrimination, and strip the Supreme Court of its ability to protect civil rights.

 

<p>“I knew Martin Luther King.  Martin Luther King, Jr. was a friend of mine.  John Roberts is no Martin Luther King, Jr.,” said George Mason University Professor and civil rights leader Roger Wilkins.  “As a matter of fact, John Roberts is far closer to Brad Reynolds, whose tenure at the Justice Department was devoted to tearing down everything that King and the civil rights movement had achieved in the 1960’s.”

 

<p>“This is nothing less than an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the African American community, but we will not be fooled by false prophets,” said Rev. Tim McDonald, who chairs African American Ministers in Action.  “John Roberts’ record is clear.  Throughout his career in government, he was at the center of efforts to roll back protections against racial discrimination.  And now you’re going to tell us he’s another Martin Luther King?  Project 21’s assertions are outrageous.”

 

<p>Massie, who is notorious for having once called all Democrats racist, saying that they are “fully representative of Bull Connor and Orval Faubus,” is not the only self-proclaimed African American “leader” who will appear at tomorrow’s press conference.  Niger Innis, Robert Woodson, and Phyllis Berry Meyers will also be there.

 

<p>“These brothers and sisters should be ashamed,” said Jeff Johnson, producer and host of BET’s Cousin Jeff Chronicles and Director of African American Outreach for People For the American Way.  “John Roberts is a man who said affirmative action is bound to fail because it requires the ‘recruiting of inadequately prepared candidates.’  He thought the federal courts could be forbidden from ordering effective school desegregation programs.  And he said that a Supreme Court decision giving individuals more power to address violations of their civil rights caused ‘damage.’  John Roberts has not the slightest claim to Martin Luther King’s noble legacy.”
