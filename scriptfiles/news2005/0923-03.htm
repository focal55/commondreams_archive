<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 23 - <p>   -- Military Families, Veterans Hold Candlelight Vigil to Honor Fallen at 'Arlington West' Exhibit in D.C.</p>
<p>   -- Families and Vets Say: "Real support for our troops means: Bring them home now and take care of them when they get here."</p>
<p>   Tonight, Friday, Sept. 23, at 7:30 p.m. military families and veterans opposed to the Iraq war will hold a candlelight vigil at Arlington West exhibit at the Camp Casey Memorial Tent near the southeast corner of Constitution Avenue and 15th Street. Participants in the vigil will include military families who have loved ones currently serving in Iraq or about to deploy; Gold Star families whose loved ones died as a result of the war in Iraq; as well as veterans of the Iraq war and previous wars. They have traveled to Washington, D.C. from across the country to join tens of thousands for a massive march and rally on Sept. 24 to protest the Iraq war.</p>
<p>   WHEN: TODAY, Friday, Sept. 23, 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>   WHAT: Candlelight Vigil at "Camp Casey DC" Memorial to Fallen Soldiers</p>
<p>   WHO: Gold Star Families, Military Families, Iraq War Veterans and Veterans from Previous Wars</p>
<p>   WHERE: Near corner of Constitution Ave. and 15th Street, NW</p>
<p>   For the last three weeks, Military and Gold Star Families, Iraq War Veterans and Veterans from previous wars traveled the country speaking the truth about the war in Iraq, visiting 51 cities in 28 states, engaging in over 200 speaking engagements in 21 days. The "Bring them Home Now Tour" from Crawford, Texas to Washington, D.C. left "Camp Casey" in Crawford on the last day of the nearly month long vigil outside of President Bush's ranch, where Cindy Sheehan set up camp waiting for a  meeting with President Bush that never took place.</p>
