<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 15 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Rising, an organization founded by Ralph Nader, has started an anti-war blog today.  The blog includes columns by Ralph Nader, founder of Democracy Rising, Kevin Zeese, a director of Democracy Rising and Virginia Rodino, also a director of the organization and a member of the steering committee on United for Peace and Justice.  The blog is part of the Stop the Warcampaign of Democracy Rising.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader's first blog entry focuses on restarting the anti-war movement and regaining the momentum the movement showed before the beginning of the war.  Nader points out that the anti-war movement sponsored no major demonstrations during the presidential election year.  Instead, they took off from their anti-war work to support the campaign of Senator John Kerry.  Peace activists supported Kerry, without pushing him to oppose the war, even though Kerry supported the Iraq War and promised to fight the war to win it.  Nader asks: How do we regain momentum for peace?</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zeese focuses on the two year anniversary of the war highlighting how both Iraq and the United States are worse off since the war began.  Iraqis struggle for the basic necessities of life food, electricity, petrol, jobs and struggle to form a government that merely serves the interests of the United States.  Both countries have lost thousands to casualties, and are poorer, less safe and less secure after two years of occupation. Zeese urges reconsideration of the mistaken Iraq policy.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rodino, who serves on the steering committee of the leading coalition group working to end the war United for Peace and Justice, examines how to get the movement going.  She looks at the role of demonstrations in the anti-war movement and urges the peace movement to escalate its public efforts to end the war and occupation.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The blogs can be read and commented on by visiting <a href="http://www.DemocracyRising.US" target="_new">http://www.DemocracyRising.US</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
