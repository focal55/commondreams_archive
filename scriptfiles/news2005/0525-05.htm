<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 25 -- The 
        Violence Policy Center (VPC) today applauded the New York State Assembly 
        for voting last night to ban 50 caliber sniper rifles. The measure must 
        now go to the New York State Senate. The legislative effort was spearheaded 
        by New Yorkers Against Gun Violence (NYAGV), the state's leading gun violence 
        prevention organization. </font>
      </p><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The VPC has long advocated 
        for a ban on the sale and possession of 50 caliber sniper rifles and was 
        the first organization in the country to alert the American public to 
        the dangers posed by these weapons with its landmark 2001 study, <a href="http://www.vpc.org/studies/roofcont.htm"><i>Voting 
        From the Rooftops: How the Gun Industry Armed Osama bin Laden, Other Foreign 
        and Domestic Terrorists, and Common Criminals With 50 Caliber Sniper Rifles</i></a>. 
        Subsequent VPC studies have exposed the ability of these rifles to attack 
        bulk fuel tanks and other high-value targets from a distance, as well 
        as their ability to destroy commercial aircraft. [<a href="../../50caliber.htm">Follow 
        this link for more information on the threat posed by 50 caliber sniper 
        rifles, including their use in crime</a>.] In September 2004 California 
        became the first state in the nation to ban the weapons. Federal legislation 
        to restrict their availability has been introduced in the U.S. House and 
        Senate. </font>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VPC Senior Policy 
        Analyst Tom Diaz, author of the VPC studies, states, "Last night's action 
        by the New York State Assembly sends a strong message to New York State 
        residents and citizens across the country that these weapons of war must 
        be banned. Fifty caliber rifles, used by our troops in Iraq and around 
        the world, can penetrate armor plating and are accurate to over a mile, 
        yet they are as easy to buy as a hunting rifle, and less restricted than 
        handguns."</font> </p><P align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
