Gerard Jean-Juste said that Lavalas activists and all the lovers of the Haitian constitution are called to stand up for the Constitution of Haiti and join in the peaceful March to Support the Constitution on Tuesday, March 29, 2005 in Bel-Air.   	The march will start at 10 am outside Our Lady of Perpetual Help church in Bel-Air. 	Fr. Gerard Jean-Juste said they hope to be joined by different groups and they will march together through Bel-Air then on to the Constitutional Square by the Palace. &quot;With this anniversary of the constitution,&quot; Fr. Jean-Juste said, &quot;we call on every Haitian and every person in every nation to help us support our constitution.  I was in Washington, DC, at the inauguration of President George Bush when he swore to uphold and respect and protect the constitution of the United States.  Just as President Bush pledged to uphold and respect and protect his Constitution, we in Haiti must stand up to uphold and respect and protect our Constitution.  Therefore, we call for the return of our constitutional government, for the physical return of our constitutionally elected President Aristide, and for the release of all political prisoners.  We call on everyone to join us.&quot; 	The UN has been asked to provide security for the marchers.			</font></p><p align="LEFT">	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who to contact for more information:<br>	Fr.
