<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - Survivors of Hurricane Katrina from around the country will announce the formation of a national group, the ACORN Hurricane Survivors Association during a conference call press conference on Tuesday October 18, 2005 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (noon CST, 11:00am MST, 10:00 a.m. PST.) To join the call, please email acorncomm@acorn.org for the dial-in information.

<p>Speakers on the call will be displaced New Orleans residents now living in Baton Rouge, Houston, and several other cities around the country, and New Orleans ACORN Head Organizer Stephen Bradberry, who recently won the RFK Memorial Human Rights Award. The call will include:
- the announcement of the ACORN Hurricane Survivors Association;
- the stories of survivors, turned community leaders;
- An organizing plan to win a just recovery for New Orleans and the region.

<p>“The people who have been hardest hit by Katrina need to have a voice in the rebuilding process,” said Tanya Harris, a former resident of the 9th ward and a leader of the Survivors Association. “We want to return to our homes, and take part in rebuilding our communities. Right now, too many decisions are being made without us at the table.”

<p>Members of ACORN, a national community group that had its headquarters and over 9,000 member families in New Orleans, has already organized Town Hall Meetings, community campaigns for better relief in Texas, Louisiana, and elsewhere. Organizers say they expect thousands of new members to join the Survivors Organization, which will help scattered community members keep in touch with each other, and fight for “first source”, living wage jobs for returning residents, affordable housing, and a voice for the low and moderate income families displaced by the storm.

<p>ACORN is the nation's largest community organization of low- and moderate-income families, with over 175,000 member families organized into 800 neighborhood chapters in 80 cities across the country. Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on issues of concern to our members. Our priorities include: better housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for low-wage workers, more investment in our communities from banks and governments, and better public schools. We achieve these goals by building community organizations that have the power to win changes -- through direct action, negotiation, legislation, and voter participation.. ACORN stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.
