<p>NEW YORK - Attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), counsel for the Guantánamo detainees, today decried the Department of Defense’s transfer of Mr. Sami Al Laithi to Egypt, a country with a long history of human rights violations and state-sponsored torture, despite the fact that a motion was filed with the court to prevent his rendition there.

 

<p>Mr. Laithi was one of the Guantánamo detainees who had been declared by the Department of Defense to be “no longer an enemy combatant” – a government designation meaning that he is not associated with Al Qaeda or affiliated terrorist organizations and presents no risk of engaging in terrorist activities.  This designation, which apparently comes as close to a declaration of innocence as the United States is willing to make, means that the individual is eligible for release to freedom.  

 

<p>CCR cooperating counsel Clive Stafford-Smith had filed a motion to prevent the transfer of his client, Mr. Al Laithi, to Egypt based on the likelihood that he would be tortured or abused.  The government transferred Mr. Al Laithi over the week-end, without prior notice to his attorneys or the Court, preventing CCR and Mr. Stafford-Smith from asserting Mr. Al Laithi’s right, pursuant to the Convention Against Torture, not to be returned to a country that is on record as practicing torture.

 

<p>CCR leads a team of more than 450 pro bono attorneys from around the country representing Guantánamo detainees, and in March of this year successfully mobilized counsel to block the government’s plans to render up to half of the population at Guantánamo to prisons in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Yemen, and obtained orders preventing the transfer of detainees into the custody of other countries without judicial oversight. 

 

<p>“The law is clear that even when the government has decided to release someone to freedom, it is still obligated to ensure that the transfer to another country will not present a risk of torture or abuse to the person being released,” said CCR attorney Barbara Olshansky.  “The Convention against Torture, which has been signed and ratified by the United States, requires the government to make this analysis and to fully consider the concerns of the person being transferred,” she added.  “That plainly did not happen here.”  

 

<p>According to CCR attorney Tina M. Foster, “the judges in more than 40 Guantánamo habeas cases plainly understood the grave danger of repatriation of people to countries with poor human rights records.”  She also described the transfer of Mr. Al Laithi as “outrageous under the circumstances – he is not an enemy combatant, yet he was transferred to Egypt against his will and faces a substantial risk of torture.”
