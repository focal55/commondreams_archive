<p>WASHINGTON - December 20 - The following is a  statement by Sara Zdeb, legislative director of Friends of the  Earth, regarding the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel Alito: </p>
<p>   &quot;Today, Friends of the Earth (FOE) joins our partners in the  environmental community in announcing our opposition to the  Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel Alito.  Our announcement  marks the first time that environmental organizations have  opposed a Supreme Court nominee since the 1987 nomination of  Robert Bork-underscoring just how big of a threat we believe  Judge Alito poses to our environment. </p>
<p>   &quot;When it comes to the constitutional questions that will  determine the ability of Congress to pass environmental laws and  the ability of citizens to access courts to enforce them, Judge  Alito threatens to drive the Court in a decidedly anti- environment direction. </p>
<p>   &quot;In the coming months the Supreme Court will decide two cases  that could radically restrict our ability to protect the vast  majority of the nation's waterways under the Clean Water Act.   Judge Alito's record indicates that he's likely to side with  those who oppose a strong Clean Water Act.  His record also bodes  poorly for future cases challenging the Endangered Species Act  and other important laws. </p>
<p>   &quot;Judge Alito has also voted to shut courthouse doors to  citizens concerned about their environment.  Citizen enforcement  suits are an indispensable feature of every major environmental  law, empowering ordinary Americans to sue polluters when  government lacks the resources or political will to enforce the  law.   In one case, Judge Alito held that FOE and other  environmentalists lacked standing to sue a polluter-even though  it was uncontested that the company had violated the Clean Water  Act 150 times. </p>
<p>   &quot;Judge Samuel Alito has been nominated to fill the seat of  Justice O'Connor, an important swing vote who often tipped the  Court's balance in favor of protecting our environment.  Too much  hangs in the balance to entrust a lifetime appointment to Judge  Alito, who could tip the balance against our environment.  We  look forward to working with our allies in the Senate, other  outside groups, and concerned citizens around the nation to  defeat this nomination.&quot; </p>
