Monday's Day of Action will include a march and rally at the Capitol and at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in opposition to the privatization of social security; the release of a new report demonstrating racial discrimination by Wells Fargo, and rallies at the offices of tax preparation firms.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 10 a.m. -- Wells Fargo Report Release, Federal Reserve, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue NW</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Noon -- Rally against Social Security Privatization, Church of the Reformation, 212 E.

For the past thirteen years members have come to the seat of government to hold their elected officials accountable to their concerns.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are ready to tell everyone up to the highest levels of government that Low and Moderate Income people will NOT be ignored,&quot; said ACORN National President Maude Hurd. &quot;We will not let President Bush cast our concerns about his budget and new policy proposals aside. We will not stand idly by as racial disparities persist in mortgage lending. And we certainly will do all that we can to stop the abusive practices of commercial tax preparation chains.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advanced copies of the Wells Fargo study are available.

Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on issues of concern to our members. ACORN's priorities include: better housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for low-wage workers, more investment in ACORN's communities from banks and governments, and better public schools. ACORN achieves these goals by building community organizations that have the power to win changes -- through direct action, negotiation, legislation, and voter participation. ACORN is an acronym, and each letter should be capitalized. ACORN stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. ACORN's website is at <a href="http://www.acorn.org/" target="_new">http://www.acorn.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To receive updates on ACORN's work every two weeks go to <a href="http://acorn.org/getinvolved" target="_new">http://acorn.org/getinvolved</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
