<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 2 -- The following is a statement of Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer on decision by House Speaker Dennis Hastert to replace House Ethics Committee Chairman Joel Hefley:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is extremely unfortunate that House Speaker Dennis Hastert has punished former House Ethics Committee Chairman Hefley simply for doing his job and enforcing the ethics rules against House members, such as House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Speaker Hastert has seriously damaged the integrity of the House as an institution and his own credibility as the leader of the House by removing Representative Hefley as Ethics Committee Chairman.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The immediate threshold credibility test for the new House Ethics Committee Chairman, Representative Doc Hastings, and for the other House Republicans who will serve on the Ethics Committee is the following: will they simply carry out the obvious game plan of the House Republican leadership to shut down ethics enforcement in the House, or will they have the courage to carry out the ethics enforcement responsibilities that go with their positions.&quot;</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
