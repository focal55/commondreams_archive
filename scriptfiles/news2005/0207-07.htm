<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO -- February 7 -- Tides Center has been awarded grants totaling $4.5 million to significantly expand its services to social innovators and nonprofit organizations. W.K. Kellogg Foundation led the funding with a three-year grant of $4.07 million. Additional funders of the initiative include the Skoll Foundation, which has contributed $225,000, as well as The Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund and The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which have each contributed $100,000.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With this substantial funding, Tides Center is deploying a scalable technology platform that will enable thousands of nonprofits and fiscal sponsors to operate more efficiently and effectively. This platform will greatly increase the availability of affordable, quality, administrative infrastructure and reduce duplication in the nonprofit sector. Tides Center also will use the grants to collaborate with others to improve standards of practice and accountability in the sector. Currently, Tides Center provides grants management, administrative, financial and human resources services to charitable initiatives not incorporated as 501(c)(3)s. Tides Center is the fiscal sponsor to hundreds of projects across the U.S. in such areas as economic development, social justice and the environment.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kellogg Foundation initially funded Tides Center in 2003 with a $950,000 grant to support strategic planning and collaboration efforts. With this latest grant, Kellogg is investing in Tides Center's implementation of its plan. &quot;Tides Center's history of enabling nonprofit leaders to focus on their missions and programs by sharing a common legal home and administrative infrastructure uniquely qualifies the organization to lead this important sector-wide initiative,&quot; said Tom Reis, Program Director at W.K. Kellogg Foundation. &quot;We believe this initiative will transform many organizations in the nonprofit sector by increasing their financial sustainability, enhancing the effectiveness of their programs, and, ultimately, increasing their impact in the communities they serve. Kellogg Foundation is pleased to extend its relationship with Tides Center.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In today's environment, affordable, up-to-date infrastructure and effective operating and governance practices are not merely a matter of convenience, but a matter of survival for nonprofits,&quot; said Willa Seldon, Executive Director, Tides Center. &quot;Tides Center is honored to act as a leader in developing and making available these valuable services to the nonprofit sector. We also look forward to collaborating with other management support organizations as a part of this initiative.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Fiscal sponsors allow social entrepreneurs to focus on what's mission critical,&quot; said Barbara Kibbe, Vice President, Program and Effectiveness at the Skoll Foundation. &quot; As the largest national fiscal sponsor and the national leader, Tides Center is well placed and poised to grow its business, to strengthen the field of fiscal sponsorship domestically and to explore international expansion. All three of these strategic objectives support the incubation of social entrepreneurship and the development of infrastructure for the nonprofit sector.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tides Center has provided administrative support to The Children's Partnership for over 10 years as we have grown from the start-up stage to a well-functioning organization,&quot; said Wendy Lazarus, Founder and Co-President, The Children's Partnership. &quot;We are delighted to see foundations investing in infrastructure for the nation's nonprofits, and we look forward to the expanded information technology and other new services that Tides Center will offer.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About Tides Center<br>Tides Center is the nation's leading fiscal sponsor for social change initiatives providing a legal home as well as administrative, human resources and financial infrastructure services nationwide.
