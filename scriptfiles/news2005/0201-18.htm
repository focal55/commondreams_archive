<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 1 -- &quot;District Judge Robert E. Jones in Portland, Oregon, yesterday ruled that the Bush administration has a duty to uphold the intent of the Endangered Species Act to recover populations of at-risk fish and wildlife. The decision, which declared the actions of Interior Secretary Gale Norton to downlist the gray wolf unlawful, is a victory for responsible wildlife management.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration's proposal would have undermined efforts to restore healthy wolf populations to America&#146;s wildlands. With this decision the Bush Administration will need to move forward with wolf conservation that relies on the best available science, not ideology.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a victory for science-based wildlife conservation. The Bush administration&#146;s attempt to prematurely end the federal wolf recovery program in the Eastern United States is part of a politically-driven agenda to weaken enforcement of the Endangered Species Act -- the safety net on which America's wildlife depends.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now the American people have before them a great opportunity to keep the promise of the Endangered Species Act and restore healthy wolf populations that can be enjoyed by future generations.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club was joined by 18 other conservation groups in the suit including the Defenders of Wildlife. The case is Civil case No. 03-1348-JO.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
