<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - September 5 - The National Organization for Women has been outspoken in our 
            opposition to the nomination of an anti-women's rights, anti-civil 
            rights judge, <A 
            href="http://lists.now.org/t/237735/149703/1215081/0/">John G. 
            Roberts</A>, to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. Now that Roberts' 
            attitudes toward women have been revealed, it is an outrage and an 
            insult to the women of this country that George W. Bush has 
            nominated such a jurist to be Chief Justice of the United 
States.
<P>First, there cannot be a "stealth nominee" for Chief Justice. 
            Bush must release every document from Roberts' tenure as Principal 
            Deputy Solicitor General under the first President Bush, and any 
            remaining writings from his time as an advisor to the Reagan 
            administration. How dare Bush nominate this candidate for the top 
            position on the Supreme Court when his administration has 
            deliberately concealed hundreds of thousands of pages of his 
            writings, during a time that he was one of the top lawyers 
            representing the people of the United States? If the Bush 
            administration refuses to release these papers, we must ask 
            ourselves what they are hiding. And the Senate must ask the same 
            question. </P>
            <P>The Senate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate must find its 
            collective spine and not roll over for Bush's favored candidate. 
            They must refuse to move forward until all requested documents are 
            released, and they must ask even tougher questions of Roberts 
            because of the critical nature of the Chief Justice appointment. 
</P>
            <P>Second, NOW is even more concerned that John Roberts, as Chief 
            Justice, will have a greater opportunity to move the Court and our 
            country backward. The Chief Justice plays a key role in leading the 
            Court, including deciding who writes certain opinions, making 
            numerous appointments within the judicial system, and presiding, 
            alone, over presidential impeachment hearings. If Roberts is 
            confirmed as Chief Justice, Bush will have established right-wing 
            leadership of the Court for another 30 years-a lifetime legacy of 
            the Bush presidency that women and girls will have a lifetime to 
            regret. </P>
            <P>Third, I am taken aback (but not surprised) by Bush's cynicism 
            and lack of compassion in nominating Chief Justice William 
            Rehnquist's successor even as his body is being prepared to lie in 
            repose at the Court. Bush's lack of sensitivity has been on 
            prominent display this past month as he avoided Gold Star mom Cindy 
            Sheehan and was stubbornly slow responding to the humanitarian 
            crisis in New Orleans and Mississippi. With the South still in 
            turmoil from Hurricane Katrina, Bush is pressuring the Senate to 
            rush through this very important process and confirm John Roberts to 
            a lifetime as Chief Justice while the country is looking the other 
            way. </P>
            <P>Finally, Bush now has a second opportunity to honor Sandra Day 
            O'Connor's legacy by naming a moderate woman to replace her as 
            associate justice. He can get it right this time, and if Bush needs 
            any help finding a woman who will uphold women's rights, NOW will be 
            happy to help. </P>
