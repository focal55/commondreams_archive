<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 5 -- Mabel Dobbs, Chair of the Western Organization of Resource Councils Livestock Committee, issued the following statement in response to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcement that it plans to reopen the U.S. border to imports of live Canadian cattle, despite the confirmation of BSE (or mad cow disease) in a third Canadian cow. Dobbs ranches near Weiser, Idaho.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reopening the U.S.-Canadian border to live cattle imports, despite confirmation of yet another BSE-infected Canadian cow, is the height of irresponsibility. USDA&#146;s plan is not based on sound science. It puts U.S. consumers at risk, threatens to delay resumption of US beef exports to Asia, and would devastate U.S. cattle markets. These problems are aggravated by the fact that USDA, the National Cattlemen&#146;s Beef Association, and the beef packers who would benefit from resumption of live cattle imports, have been the primary forces behind delayed implementation of country of origin labeling. Labeling beef by its country of origin would allow consumers to choose whether or not to buy beef from cattle of Canadian origin, if the borders are reopened.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Cattlemen&#146;s Beef Association&#146;s endorsement of reopening the border is appalling. Once again, the NCBA has supported the interests of the very largest multinational beef packers over the interests of U.S. cattle producers. Once again, the NCBA has ignored the interests of U.S. consumers. The NCBA has extended the long list of reasons that U.S. cattle producers oppose the beef checkoff, which provides 90% of NCBA&#146;s funding. The mandatory beef checkoff forces us to subsidize an organization which opposes the interests of the cattle producers who pay it. We eagerly await the United States Supreme Court&#146;s decision regarding the constitutionality of the checkoff.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORC urges the United States Congress to block USDA&#146;s plan to reopen the border on March 7. USDA and the NCBA do not have the best interests of United States consumers and cattle producers at heart; Congress must step in. </font></p><p> </p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORC is a network of grassroots organizations from seven states that include 8,750 members and 50 local community groups.</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
