<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 1 - The National Organization for Women, on behalf of more than 550,000 contributing members, is deeply opposed to the nomination of <a href="http://www.now.org/issues/judicial/supreme/" target="_new">John G. Roberts</a> to the Supreme Court. 

<p>John Roberts is not just a conservative. Many, many conservatives believe in equal rights and opportunities for women, and equal educational opportunities for their daughters without discrimination or harassment. Roberts' attitudes aren't conservative, they're simply backward. And women can't afford to go that direction.

<p>NOW is here today-with nearly 20 feminist and progressive allies who are taking local action to defeat this nomination — because John Roberts has demonstrated not only an aversion, but a disdain for many of the issues that are at the heart of the advances we've made in the past 30 years: affirmative action, Title IX equal educational opportunities, constitutional protections against sex discrimination and sexual harassment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the separation of church and state, and our right to personal privacy and reproductive rights.

<p>Roberts has been downright dismissive of people who stand up for their own rights and the rights of others, with the cavalier attitude of one whose rights have always been guaranteed.

<p>We know what is at stake for women, so NOW has been mobilizing our members and chapters across the country to educate women in their communities about the danger of a Roberts confirmation. For more than six weeks now, our supporters have been educating their friends and neighbors, making calls and sending messages to their Senators, visiting their Senators at home during the recess, and holding demonstrations and vigils at Senators' home offices.

<p>Now we are ramping up even more, in partnership with all the groups represented here, and our activists are traveling to Washington, D.C., to lobby their senators in person and help create a visible front in this important battle. They are organizing campus campaigns and local events, and generating letters and phone calls — telling their Senators that we are united in one message: A lifetime appointment for John Roberts on the Supreme Court would spell decades of disaster for women and girls.
