<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 8 - Recent trends in the housing market suggest a
dangerous housing bubble, rather than a run-up caused by fundamental
factors such as higher incomes and population growth, according to a new
study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR). <br><br>
The report, &quot;<i>Will a Bursting Bubble Trouble Bernanke? The
Evidence for a Housing Bubble,</i>&quot; cites three trends in the
housing market that suggest an unsustainable increase in house prices: 1)
A sharp divergence between house sale prices and rents; 2) An
extraordinary jump in the rate of housing construction; and 3) A sharp
decline in the savings rate, driven by a housing wealth effect.<br><br>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman nominee Benjamin Bernanke has argued that
there is no housing bubble and, therefore, no reason for the Fed to take
action to address the bubble. Bernanke's approach raises grave risks,
since the impact of a bursting housing bubble is likely to be even
greater than the collapse of the stock bubble. The collapse of the
housing bubble will throw the economy into a recession, and quite likely
a severe recession, according to economist Dean Baker, co-author of the
report. <br><br>
&quot;If the Fed chooses to let a housing bubble expand unchecked, the
eventual cost to the economy and to millions of American families could
be enormous,&quot; said Baker. <br><br>
The report, by Dean Baker and David Rosnick, found three housing patterns
that are tell-tale signs of a housing bubble: <br><br>
- <b>A sharp divergence between house sale prices and rents. </b>If house
sale prices were pushed up by fundamentals in the housing market, it
would be expected that rents and house sale prices would rise together --
but they are not.&nbsp; The house price index has increased by an
unprecedented 51 percentage points more than the rent index since 1997.
<br><br>
- <b>A high rate of housing construction. </b>The rate of housing
construction over the last three years is more than 40 percent higher
than it was in the 17 years prior to the run-up in house prices. This is
not caused by the increase in the U.S. population, since the most rapid
growth in the number of new households actually took place in the 1970s
and early 1980s, when the huge baby boom cohort was first forming their
own households. <br><br>
- <b>A sharp decline in the savings rate. </b>If house prices move at
approximately the same pace as the overall inflation rate, as was the
case prior to 1997, then housing wealth will have little effect on the
savings rate. However, in the last eight years, house prices have
outpaced the overall rate of inflation. The resulting wealth effect has
depressed the savings rate, which has actually turned negative in recent
months.<br><br>
