<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON -- January 5 -- Beatrice Fernando, a Sri Lankan survivor of slavery, joined with the American Anti-Slavery Group to call for increased vigilance against child trafficking in the wake of the recent tsunami in Southeast Asia.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So many children are at risk,&quot; Fernando said. &quot;The governments of Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand, and India need to act now to prevent traffickers from exploiting the crisis.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to recent reports, one of the devastating consequences of the recent tsunami in Southeast Asia is an increased risk of children being abducted into slavery.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even before the tsunami hit, human trafficking was rampant in the region,&quot; noted Anti-Slavery Group associate director Jesse Sage. &quot;But now thousands of children are homeless, displaced, and orphaned -- easy targets for crime rings that profit from trafficking in human beings.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fernando, who as a young woman was trafficked from Sri Lanka to Lebanon, ended up enslaved, forced to endure severe beatings and work without pay. She recently published an autobiography, In Contempt of Fate, which addresses the problem of human trafficking.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sri Lankans are like one big family,&quot; Fernando explained. &quot;Even a stranger you meet on the street, you call 'auntie' or 'uncle.' So children are naturally open to strangers. We must make sure that orphaned children are not falling prey to traffickers planning to sell them into slavery. I have felt that pain and barely survived to return to my family. I cannot imagine the horror of these children, who have no families left to comfort them.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sage hailed Fernando's courage in speaking out about her own experience. &quot;Beatrice's experience reminds us that slavery is not history. Today, we must remain vigilant.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Anti-Slavery Group's latest action alert to its 40,000 members includes a call on regional governments to take concrete steps to reduce the potential for abductions, including: effectively monitoring borders, alerting displaced persons about the methods used by traffickers, registering children taking shelter in refugee camps and orphanages, and offering a hotline for people who suspect traffickers operating in their communities.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Governments and relief workers are struggling to cope with the tsunami's devastating destruction,&quot; Fernando said. &quot;I hope they can prevent human traffickers from making the situation worse.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
