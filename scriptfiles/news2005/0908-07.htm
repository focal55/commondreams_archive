<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->ROTTERDAM,  Netherlands - September 8 -  The Greenpeace ship 
"Argus" today protested at Europe's largest coal import harbour in 
Rotterdam blocking cranes from unloading imported coal from South 
Africa, Indonesia, US and Australia. The international organisation 
urges European governments to immediately stop using coal to avoid 
climate change and to switch to renewable energy and move to a clean 
energy economy. In addition, teams of activists unfurled a banner 
reading 'coal fuels climate change' on a coal stockpile and occupied 
coal loaders.

<p>"Climate change is now the single biggest threat facing our planet. Coal 
is one of the dirtiest fossil fuels, producing more carbon dioxide that 
contributes to global warming. Greenpeace is here today to expose 
Europe's dangerous addiction to coal. This port currently imports 24.7 
million tonnes of coal from all over the world each year, and every 
tonne returns to us as climate change," said Sven Teske, Greenpeace 
International renewable energy expert. 

<p>Europe's power sector will decide how the new energy capacity will be 
built during the next ten years. Half of Europe's working coal power 
plants are over twenty years old. "The choice will be whether Europe's 
power supply will be dirty fossil fuels like coal or efficient and clean 
renewable energy. Every euro invested in clean energy is a step away 
from dependency on imported fuels, world market prices and climate 
disruption. Renewable energy is the best way to meet needs for clean 
electricity," Teske said.

<p>Greenpeace demands that the development of renewable energy in Europe 
must achieve 300,000 MW -by 2020-, equivalent to one third of total EU 
electricity capacity and it can be reached by setting legally binding 
targets as part of a review of the renewable energy electricity 
directive for European countries. This major policy shift is required to 
provide crucial investor confidence in the clean energy sector.

<p>"A combination of legally binding targets, support mechanisms for 
renewable energies and phase-out of subsidies for fossil energy will 
make an uptake of renewables real," said Sven Teske, Greenpeace 
International energy expert, on board the ship.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
