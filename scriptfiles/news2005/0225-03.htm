<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COLTON, CA -- February 25  -- The nearly two-year rescue effort of dozens of big cats from the worst cruelty case in history, which sparked international attention, ends this week as the final seven tigers -- four males and three females -- are moved to their permanent new home on Saturday, Feb. 26. The announcement was made by The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), <a href="http://www.fund.org/index.html" target="_new">The Fund for Animals</a>, and <a href="http://www.pawsweb.org/" target="_new">Performing Animal Welfare Society</a> (PAWS). The seven tigers will join 32 others at PAWS' ARK2000 sanctuary in San Andreas, Calif., where the once abused and malnourished cats will now live healthy and safe lives with trees, dens, and swimming pools.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final move comes just days after the verdict finding the man responsible for those conditions, John Weinhart, guilty of 56 counts in the tiger abuse case. According to Michael Markarian, executive vice president for External Affairs of The Humane Society of the United States, and president of The Fund for Animals, &quot;We are gratified that the jury in the tiger abuse case took the animal cruelty crimes very seriously, and found Weinhart guilty of 56 counts, including 14 felonies. This verdict sends a strong message across the country that cruelty to animals will not be tolerated, whether the animals are wild or domestic, housecats or tigers. We hope that strong penalties are imposed when sentencing occurs on March 22.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April 2003, California officials raided the home of an illegal breeder in Riverside County, Calif., where they found 90 tiger carcasses (including 58 cubs), and 13 tiger and leopard cubs emaciated and barely alive. The state then seized 54 animals still housed at the breeder's business -- a &quot;pseudo-sanctuary&quot; called &quot;Tiger Rescue&quot; -- from which ten tigers had been removed the previous Fall. The Fund for Animals, led by Chuck Traisi and hundreds of volunteers, took over round-the-clock care (at the now-defunct tiger rescue location) for the cats, rehabilitating them and working tirelessly to find them safe, accredited sanctuaries to live. All but 39 big cats were successfully placed and The Fund went on to raise $250,000 to build a sanctuary for the remaining cats.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the ten acre sanctuary - PAWS' ARK2000 in San Andreas, Calif. -- was being constructed, The Fund continued to improve the health of the tigers with a feeding regimen of 600 pounds of food a day, and care for all of their medical and physiological needs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June 2004, the first group of eight cats headed to PAWS, and over the past nine months small groups of four to eight cats were transported up the coast from Colton to San Andreas. The final seven leave Colton this weekend, putting a happy ending to the story.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To see these magnificent animals be able to play and swim in habitats conducive to their well being is nothing short of miraculous given the sickening conditions in which they were found,&quot; said Traisi, who has spent the last 20 months away from home and family in Riverside County overseeing the health and welfare of these animals. &quot;I can now go home knowing that these animals will live the rest of their lives protected and in excellent condition.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While these big cats were fortunate that humane organizations came to their rescue, unfortunately there are an estimated 10,000 tigers privately owned in this country -- double the number of those in the wild in Asia. Most are bred and abused in order for their &quot;owners&quot; to try to &quot;domesticate&quot; them. Ninety percent die within their first two years of captivity.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wild animals belong in the wild and we must end private ownership,&quot; said Markarian. &quot;It is dangerous to people, to the animals, and to the preservation of species. We were able to help these cats, but we cannot help the thousands trapped in horrid conditions in people's homes and pseudo-sanctuaries. We need stronger laws and public education to prevent the tragic consequences of taking a wild animal out of the wild.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, President Bush signed a bill that prohibits interstate sales of pet tigers, and The HSUS is working to enact stronger laws at the state and local levels.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T<i>he Humane Society of the United States is the nation's largest animal protection organization with more than 8.5 million members and constituents.
