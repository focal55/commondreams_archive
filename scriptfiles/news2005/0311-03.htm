THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS -- March 11  -- &#147;The State of the Coral Reefs of the U.S. Virgin Islands&#148; is the shared effort of scientists, researchers, divers, fishermen, government and other stakeholders in the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands has experienced a decline in the health of its coral ecosystems in recent decades, due primarily to overfishing, pollution and coastal development. This book is intended to foster a dialogue among all stakeholders and involve them in implementing solutions to these problems.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We inherited reefs that were alive with vibrant corals, abundant fish, sea turtles, and other ocean life, and we have a shared responsibility to pass healthy reef ecosystems on to our children and grandchildren,&#148; said Roger Rufe, president of The Ocean Conservancy, at the book launch on St. Thomas. &quot;To fulfill that responsibility, we must plan for the future, and remember that the islands' economic well-being and quality of life depend upon healthy reefs. Whether you fish, run a dive operation, a resort, or are a scientist or researcher,&#148; says Rufe, &quot;you depend on healthy reefs. If they disappear, so do livelihoods.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marine biologist and Ocean Conservancy board member Sylvia Earle participated in the book launch events by leading a dive with authors off the coast of St. John, the same place she made history 35 years ago as part of the Tektite II mission, a five- woman team that spent two weeks under water researching the marine ecosystem. In contributing to &#147;State of the Coral Reefs,&#148; Earle reminds readers &quot;the ocean is resilient, it can heal. If we're going to save ocean life, we've got to start protecting undersea habitats, too.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are here to launch a book and a dialogue. We hope this will be an ongoing dialogue about how we can all be better stewards of U.S. Virgin Islands coral reefs, because they won't survive without us,&quot; said Nicholas Drayton, Caribbean Ecosystem Project Manager for The Ocean Conservancy. &quot;The reefs are living systems, and people are a part of that system. What we do on land -&#151; or in the water&#151;affects the coral reefs.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two-day book launch included a presentation to the U.S. Virgin Islands Governor Charles W. Turnbull at a reception hosted at his mansion, a dive led by Sylvia Earle, and a guided tour of the marine environment by Earle and Roger Rufe for school children of the USVI on a windowed submarine provided by Atlantis. The book was officially launched at Coral World, where an exhibit highlighting the changing state of the reefs titled, Coral Reefs: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, was unveiled. The Exhibit includes a short film documenting native Virgin Islanders personal accounts of the declining health of the coral reefs, as well as a historical perspective of how marine life around the islands has changed.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>EDITOR&#146;S NOTE: Journalists can request a copy of the book and photos from the events by contacting Tom McCann at 202-857-3262 or <a href="mailto:tmccann@oceanconservancy.org" target="_new">tmccann@oceanconservancy.org</a>.
