<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 6 -- Today, the National Stonewall Democrats (NSD) strongly disagreed with the position of Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) regarding a proposed marriage equality plank in the platform of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Yesterday, speaking to reporters after a healthcare event in Baton Rouge, Kerry told reporters that he opposed a plank supporting marriage equality for same-sex couples in his home state.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The majority of people in Massachusetts have embraced reality with acceptance,&quot; said Eric Stern, NSD executive director. &quot;We respectfully and strongly disagree with Senator Kerry and urge him to follow the example of the state's senior Senator by supporting the enforcement of state law. Senator Kerry has been a champion for gay and lesbian families in the United States Senate for decades. That is why we are so deeply disappointed by his remarks.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next week, the Massachusetts Democratic Party is expected to approve a party platform plank supporting civil marriage for same-sex couples. The proposed platform is the result of more than two-dozen meetings of the party's platform committee conducted across the state. Massachusetts would join the Democratic parties of Colorado and Iowa in adopting such a plank. The Massachusetts Democratic Party has already voiced support for marriage equality through a resolution adopted more than a year ago. Since then, the Democratic Parties of California, New York State, Washington State and numerous county parties have issued similar resolutions.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I'm opposed to it being in a platform. I think it's a mistake,&quot; Kerry told reporters. &quot;I think it's the wrong thing, and I'm not sure it reflects the broad view of the Democratic Party in our state. I'm opposed to gay marriage. I support partnerships and civil unions.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following Senator Kerry's remarks, a spokesperson for Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) told reporters that the Senator supported the platform plank along with current state law. &quot;Senator Kennedy has demonstrated leadership by supporting marriage equality in principle and standing with the majority of Massachusetts residents,&quot; said Stern.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Kerry's remarks were also rebuked by the Philip Johnston, Chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. &quot;I have great affection and respect for John, but I disagree on this issue,&quot; Johnston told the Boston Globe. &quot;It is important that the state Democratic Party support civil rights. We need to take a stand. Most residents of the state view this as a fundamental civil right for gay and lesbian citizens.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We not only disagree with Senator Kerry in principle, but his statement is inaccurate in that the proposed platform plank does reflect the broad view of Democrats in Massachusetts,&quot; said Stern.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Boston Globe poll conducted in March found that nearly 60 percent of people in Massachusetts now support marriage equality for same-sex couples. The poll found that 71 percent of Democrats supported marriage equality, along with 53 percent of independents and 35 percent of the state's Republican minority.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>National Stonewall Democrats is the only national organization of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Democrats, with more than 90 local chapters across the nation.
