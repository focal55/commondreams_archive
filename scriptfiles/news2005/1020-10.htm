<p>WASHINGTON - October 20 - The Brady Campaign to  Prevent Gun Violence today said that the House of  Representatives' passage of a bill taking away the rights of gun  victims is a step backwards for a country founded on the rule of  law.  The bill has already been approved by the Senate, and if  signed into law by President Bush, would essentially place the  entire gun industry beyond the bounds of civil liability law.</p>
<p>   "This is a tragic capitulation to the special interest gun  lobby," said Brady Campaign President Michael Barnes.  "It's yet  another example of how much power a small group can wield behind  closed doors."</p>
<p>   Dennis Henigan, Director of the Brady Center's Legal Action  Project, issued this statement:  "The Congress can pass it.  The  President can sign it.  But this shameful law will not stand.  We  will challenge the constitutionality of this special interest  extravaganza in every court where the rights of gun violence  victims are being threatened.  This bill is an unprecedented  attack on the due process rights of victims injured by the  misconduct of an industry that seeks to escape the legal rules  that govern the rest of us.  We believe state and federal courts  across this Nation are prepared to strike it down."</p>
<p>   The New York Times earlier encouraged the President to  consider the rights of people who have already lost too much to  gun violence, instead of the financial concerns of a profitable  industry.  "Surely he would not compound the nation's gun scourge  by signing the immunity bill," the Times said.  The White House  has previously stated its support for the bill.</p>
