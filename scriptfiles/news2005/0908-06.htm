<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> WASHINGTON - September 8 - Whole Woman's Health, with medical facilities in Austin, Beaumont, San Marcos and McAllen, has opened their doors to serve women evacuees of Hurricane Katrina. "Women helping women - it's what we are all about", said Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO.

<p>WWH offices are offering free emergency gynecological health services at all four locations. In addition, they are donating supplies of much needed feminine hygiene products. WWH staff are also visiting area shelters to offer information about about available free services and to distribute health-related products and materials. Transportation for WWH care is being arranged through volunteers in each community. In Austin, WWH's efforts are being supported by volunteers from the all-women Texas Rollergirls roller-derby league. 

<p>"We are sponsoring these efforts because it is our mission to improve women's lives. Women often care for others before themselves," states Hagstrom Miller. "We are offering our comfort, support, and services to these brave women, helping them remain strong for their families."

<p>All referrals, calls for donations, and requests for assistance should be made by calling 1-877-407-0100, or by contacting a local office at:

	
<p>Austin: 512-250-1005<br>
	Beaumont: 409-833-9207
	<br>
McAllen: 956-686-23127<br>
	San Marcos: 512-392-3481
