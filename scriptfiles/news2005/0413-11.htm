<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 13 -- The League of Women Voters Education Fund (LWVEF) is pleased to announce the 10 communities that will host dialogues as part of &#147;Local Voices: Citizen Conversations on Civil Liberties and Secure Communities.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local Voices is an initiative to foster public dialogue about the balance between civil liberties and homeland security through broad community conversations. The outcomes of these League-led forums, which will take place this June, will be gathered, analyzed, and compared with larger national trends. A report will be released in the fall to coincide with the debate about the sunset provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each dialogue will be hosted by a League (LWV) or partnership of Leagues. The host Leagues are: the LWV of Baltimore City and the LWV of Baltimore County, Maryland; the LWV of Black Hawk-Bremer Counties, Iowa; the LWV of Brookhaven, New York; the LWV of Columbia-Boone County, Missouri; the LWV of Dallas, Texas; the LWV of Lexington, Kentucky; the LWV of Los Angeles, California; the LWV of Miami-Dade County, Florida; LWV of North Pinellas County, Florida along with the LWVs of Hillsborough County, Manatee County, and St. Petersburg Area; and the LWV of Seattle, Washington.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 10 communities were selected from numerous applicants and they represent a geographically, ethnically and economically diverse cross-section of the country. League facilitators in each community will be professionally trained by the Study Circles Resource Center to best engage broad public participation in these dialogues.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In this post-September 11th world, it is important to understand the relationship between our civil liberties and the security of our nation at the federal and local levels,&#148; said Kay J. Maxwell, LWVEF Chair.  &#147;Preliminary focus groups for this project have shown a need for discussions like Local Voices, as many people do not have a full understanding of these topics. We believe that Local Voices will help people learn about and discuss these issues and understand the ways in which citizen voices can be heard.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LWVEF is receiving funding for Local Voices through a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The MacArthur Foundation, with headquarters in Chicago, is a private, independent grant-making institution dedicated to helping groups and individuals foster lasting improvement in the human condition. Other partners in the project are Lake, Snell, Perry &amp; Associates and the Constitution Project.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about Local Voices or the 10 communities selected, please contact Sara Conrath at 202-263-1332 or <a href="mailto:sconrath@lwv.org" target="_new">sconrath@lwv.org</a>. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
