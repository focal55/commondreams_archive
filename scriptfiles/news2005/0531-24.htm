</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT:  Press conference by people living with HIV, AIDS activists on the day of the UN's high-level meeting of the General Assembly to review the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHEN:  Thursday June 2, 9:00 AM
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHERE: The New York Helmsley Hotel,  Murray Hill Room on the third floor, 212 East 42nd Street, Manhattan
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHO:
* Stephen Lewis, UN Special Envoy on AIDS in Africa
* Paisan Suwannawong, Director, Thai Treatment Action Group
* Dorothy Onyango, Director, Women Fighting AIDS in Kenya
* Asia Russell, Director of International Policy, Health GAP
         
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background: AIDS has killed more than 12 million people worldwide since countries signed the UN Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS in 2001, pledging their commitment to stopping AIDS. The Declaration of Commitment established time-bound targets regarding HIV treatment and prevention agreed to by all UN member countries.
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AIDS treatment advocates warn that governments are breaking their promises: several 2005 targets are in danger of being missed, threatening global efforts to increase access to life-saving AIDS treatment in developing countries. The WHO's Initiative to ensure 3 million people with HIV have access to treatment by 2005 is likely to fail: In December 2004, 700,000 people with HIV were estimated to be on treatment in developing countries. In order to reach the goal of 3 million, the number has to be doubled, twice, by the end of 2005.
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In one month, the wealthiest donor countries will meet at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, where Africa and HIV/AIDS will be high on the agenda.
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experts will comment on funding and policy commitments donors should make at the G8 Summit, as well as these questions
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* Whether donors will fill the $700 million funding gap faced by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and commit the approximately $8 billion needed by the Global Fund for 2006 and 2007
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* Why securing a fair deal on debt cancellation and elimination of IMF macroeconomic policies at the July G8 Summit is critical to the fight against AIDS in poor countries
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* What donors should be doing to correct the massive shortage of trained health care workers in poor countries struggling to increase HIV treatment access 
 
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* What impact ideologically motivated responses to HIV prevention and treatment have on efforts to respond to the pandemic.</font><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
