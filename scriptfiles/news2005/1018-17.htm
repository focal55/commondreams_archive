<p>YONKERS - Consumers Union, non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports, and the Organic Consumers Association, a non-profit consortium of more than 600,000 consumers, farmers and companies, strongly oppose any efforts that would weaken the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) and undercut consumer expectations of the "organic" label. The public has already weighed in, sending an overwhelming number-210,000 --letters to Congress expressing their concern with any weakening of the organic law, especially without public debate.

<p>The Organic Trade Association is aggressively lobbying Congress to include an amendment in the Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which would overturn Harvey vs. Johanns, a recent court decision that bars the use of synthetic ingredients in the non-organic portion of food labeled "organic." These are food products that must be made with at least 95% organic material but can have 5% non-organic ingredients. 

<p>"We are not disputing that the organic law already allows and should allow for synthetics to be used in products labeled as 'made with organic' (products made with at least 70% organic ingredients) but the industry wants the bonus of being able to carry the coveted "organic" label without shouldering the burden of meeting consumer expectations," says Dr. Urvashi Rangan, Senior Scientist and Policy Analyst at Consumers Union. 

<p>"When Consumers Union conducted a nationwide survey in March 2005 of 1,200 US adults online, we found that 85% of respondents do not expect food labeled as "organic" to contain artificial (or synthetic) ingredients," adds Rangan.

<p>"As we approach the third year anniversary of the National Organic Program, it's clear that consumers have grown even more attached to the value of the organic label. An overwhelming number of consumers have registered their opposition to the current attempts to weaken the organic standards. The reaction is nearly as strong as the record number (275,000) of public comments received during the development of the National Organic Program," said Ronnie Cummins, President of the Organic Consumers Association. 

<p>"And it's not just consumers who care about the outcome of this debate; many food processors, like Eden Foods believe in both adhering to the spirit and the letter of the law. They don't want to see it weakened in the dark of night," adds Cummins.
