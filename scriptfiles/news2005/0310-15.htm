<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- Ron Daniels, the Executive Director of the Center for Constitutional Rights spoke today at a press conference held by Congressman Markey in support of the Torture Outsourcing Protection Act, legislation to stop the Bush Administration&#146;s policy of rendition &#150; the sending of suspects to be tortured in third party countries.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center for Constitutional Rights filed the first case to challenge the practice of rendition.  CCR has taken the lead in defending victims of U.S. torture policy, from Guant&aacute;namo, to Abu Ghraib, to this barbaric practice of outsourcing torture.  CCR represents Maher Arar, the Canadian citizen the U.S. sent to Syria to be tortured and interrogated for nearly a year. After working with Mr. Arar&#146;s family to obtain his release, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit against the United States Government in January, 2004. The government has repeatedly attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed, most recently by claiming that evidence in Mr. Arar&#146;s case should be considered &#147;state secrets&#148; and that the case should be dismissed because allowing Mr. Arar his day in court would jeopardize the security of the country. CCR will be filing a response to this outrageous claim of Executive privilege and secrecy early next week</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center for Constitutional Rights has also represented other victims of rendition, including Australian Mamdouh Habib, who was sent by the U.S. to be tortured in Egypt before he was sent to Guant&aacute;namo, only to be released without charge two years later; and Ahmed Abu Ali, an American citizen who spent 20 months in detention Saudi Arabia at the behest of the U.S. government where he was tortured and never charged.  He has finally been returned to this country and charged with evidence that can only be corroborated by a dead man.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ron Daniels said, &#147;Torture is against the law in the United States. The Bush administration should not be attempting to avoid the laws of this country by sending people to be tortured over seas where other countries will do their dirty work out of the public eye.  This is a barbaric practice with no place in the 21st Century.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maher Arar has not been convicted of anything. Even the Syrians said they could find no connection to terrorism when they released him. Mr. Arar said soon after his release, &#147;I recently spent 10 1/2 months in a grave-sized cell in Syria, unsure why I was there, unsure how to get out. Fear paralyzed my wits when I needed them most. I was beaten and I was tortured and I was constantly scared. Every day I worried that I would never be released, that I would disappear into that concrete grave forever. Why was I being held? I still don't really know. I am not a terrorist. I am not a member of Al Qaeda. I am a Syrian-born Canadian. A father and a husband. A telecommunications engineer. I have never been in trouble with the police and have always been a good citizen.&#148;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
