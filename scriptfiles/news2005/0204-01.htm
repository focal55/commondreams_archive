<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Feb. 7, at 9:30 a.m. at the National Press Club,  congressional, business and community leaders will highlight how  the new Bush budget, released that day, will place the American  dream further out of reach of most Americans and create a  polarized society of haves and have-nots. A plan of action to  address the growing wealth divide will also be announced.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   REP. PETE STARK, senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Health  Subcommittee, who will speak at the press conference, said,  &quot;President Bush's budget is waging an all out attack on sensible  programs that ensure retirement security and make health care  affordable for America's working families.  Republicans say they  want to privatize Social Security to create an 'ownership  society,' when what they're really telling working Americans is,  you're on your own.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   THE HONORABLE WALTER FAUNTROY, former Congressman, founding  member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Southern Christian  Leadership Conference staffer under Martin Luther King, will also  speak.  He commented, &quot;Many of us struggled mightily to open the  doors of economic opportunity to all Americans, regardless of the  color of their skin.  A budget that ensures that the rich get  richer and the poor poorer will set our nation back.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Responsible Wealth, a national network of over 800 business  people, investors and affluent Americans who are concerned about  the deepening wealth divide in America and who advocate  widespread prosperity, will kick off a protest against  millionaires' tax cuts. Elizabeth A. Letzler, a wealthy former  banker and business Ph.D., will launch the campaign along with  her 15-year-old daughter Stephanie, by presenting the Responsible  Tax Pledge and signing it. The pledge calls on affluent Americans  to refuse the President's tax breaks that primarily benefit the  275,000 millionaire taxpayers in the U.S., and on Congress to  reject more tax cuts for wealthy Americans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   For more information, visit the Responsible Wealth Web site: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=42626&Link=http://www.responsiblewealth.org" target="_new">http://www.responsiblewealth.org</a></font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
