<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 18 - Members of the U.S. House of Representatives recently 
called on President Bush "to reconsider strengthening ties with the 
Indonesian military (TNI)."

<p>In a letter to President Bush, they wrote that they are "troubled that you 
are seeking such normalization despite the persistence of obvious human 
rights, accountability, and security force reform problems in Indonesia." 
They called normalization of relations with the military a "premature 
reward for the half-steps that have been taken."

<p>The letter, initiated by Representatives Nita Lowey (D-NY) and Christopher 
H. Smith (R-NJ), was sent as Senate and House negotiators prepare to 
reconcile their differing versions of the Foreign Operations Appropriations 
bill. The Senate version would maintain most restrictions on U.S. military 
assistance to Indonesia, while the House would eliminate them.

<p>"The House leadership should heed what its members advocate in this letter 
and agree to the strongest possible restrictions on the Indonesian military 
in the final appropriations act," said Karen Orenstein, Washington 
Coordinator of the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN).

<p>"If the Bush administration and its allies in Congress are serious about 
promoting democratic reform and human rights in Indonesia, they would 
support and strengthen the Senate's restrictions," she added.

<p>"The success so far of the recent Aceh peace agreement requires that 
Indonesia's security forces respect the Acehnese's political and human 
rights, a formidable test. The terms of the agreement must be first be 
implemented and given time to work before the Indonesian military is 
allowed any additional assistance," said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.

<p>"A recent GAO report revealed the overwhelming failure of human rights 
vetting by the State Department in Indonesia. Past assurances that U.S. 
security assistance will not in the end strengthen the hand of human rights 
violators are hollow. Further, the larger issue remains that the 
still-brutal, unreformed Indonesian military will see any U.S. assistance 
as an endorsement of business-as-usual," Miller added.

<p>The letter was signed by 54 representatives. The complete text can be found 
at http://www.etan.org/news/2005/08house.htm.

<p><b>Background
</b>
<p>The Senate version of the fiscal year 2006 Foreign Operations 
Appropriations bill would continue restrictions on foreign military 
financing and export of "lethal" military equipment until the secretary of 
state certifies that certain conditions are met pertaining to justice for 
rights violations, transparency and accountability of the TNI's operations 
and finances, and counter-terrorism efforts. The House version merely 
contains a reporting requirement on whether Indonesia has complied with 
past conditions on military assistance.

<p>A conference committee with representatives from both chambers, which may 
meet in September, must reconcile the two versions of the bill before it is 
sent to the president for signature.

<p>In recent years, Congress had maintained only one condition restricting 
full International Military Education and Training (IMET): cooperation by 
Indonesian authorities with an FBI investigation into the 2002 ambush 
murder of an Indonesian and two U.S. citizens in West Papua. In late 
February, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice restored full IMET for 
Indonesia, even though cooperation by Indonesia in this case has been 
spotty at best. The Senate version of the appropriations bill would delay 
additional IMET until Rice submits a detailed report on U.S. and Indonesian 
efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the 2002 attack.

<p>A recent report of the General Accountability Office (GAO), "Southeast 
Asia: Better Human Rights Reviews and Strategic Planning Needed for 
Assistance to Foreign Security Forces," strongly criticized procedures used 
to vet security officers from Indonesia and other countries for training, 
despite U.S. law and policy which bars training for units and individuals 
with credible evidence of human rights violations.

<p>Under President Yudhoyono, humanitarian and human rights conditions have 
significantly deteriorated in West Papua and militarization of the entire 
archipelago has increased. The Indonesian government continues to block 
substantive international efforts at accountability for crimes against 
humanity in East Timor. Last month, an appeals court overturned all 
convictions in the first test-case of accountability for Suharto-era 
crimes, the 1984 Tanjung Priok massacre that left scores of civilians 
murdered.

<p>East Timorese and Indonesian NGOs have repeatedly called for maintaining 
restrictions on military assistance. Victims and survivors of the West 
Papua killings have called for continued restriction of IMET until their 
case is fully resolved.
