MINNEAPOLIS – Utne magazine is looking for a few good women. The cause? A transformational retreat and eco
spa, hosted by the iconic magazine’s Editor in Chief Nina Utne and a variety of  visionaries and
practitioners who most inspire her for the ultimate Utne  tea party—a weekend of exploration
and friendship, movement and massage (<a href="http://www.utne.com/spa">www.utne.com/spa</a>)* Call
it just one way to get in touch with one’s "inner activist." The long weekend will take place at
The Crossings Wellness Spa in Austin. Texas, November 10-13.*
<br>

<br>This intimate gathering
offers valuable face time with contemporary women leaders as well as nourishment for body, mind and
spirit. Whole-hearted, wise and inspiring, the event will challenge participants to ask, “What do I
stand for?” Event-goers will leave more prepared to express the fullness and passion of their
convictions. 
<br> <br>“After publishing a magazine for more than 20 years that has covered
everything from the environment to politics to activism, feminism, spirituality, leisure and more,
we decided we’d offer the women who read <i>Utne</i> an event that speaks to their minds, bodies
and hearts,” says Nina Utne, Editor in Chief. “Lots of publications offer readers events like
cruises or exotic tours, but ‘rEVOLUTIONary Women’ is more practical, more intimate and more
environmentally sustainable. Attendees will leave feeling refreshed, re-energized and ready to be a
force for good, both to themselves and the world.”
<br> <br>Led by the Editor in Chief, the event
promises to be loaded with inspired conversation and insights into how to respond to the social
problems that beset us. Nina Utne expresses her convictions through the magazine and through her
personal actions, including her recent arrest in Washington D.C. while protesting the war in Iraq.
(Utne is one of the cofounders of the women’s peace group Code Pink.)  A personal account of the DC
ordeal–including her friendly and empathetic conversation with her arresting police officer and
later her jailor– are posted at the <i>Utne</i>  website at <a
href="http://www.utne.com/web_special/web_specials_2005-09/articles/11802-1.html">http://www.utne.c
om/web_special/web_specials_2005-09/articles/11802-1.html</a> -- including these samples below.
<br> <br><i><b>I have never considered myself an activist</b>, but, increasingly, I find that I
can't not act. So I felt compelled to show up in Washington D.C., to contribute whatever I could
and to experience the power that comes of knowing that we are not alone. I figured I'd do whatever
CodePink needed me for, whether tying balloons or running errands or tracking down details. As it
turned out, I ended up spending a lot of the weekend at the epicenter of the action—with Cindy
Sheehan— doing whatever needed doing.

<br> <br> At one moment, I was grabbing likely looking women
in a hotel lobby, trying to find someone who had decent looking black shoes in Cindy's shoe size—
and was willing to loan them on the spot (I found someone) and the next taking notes on precisely
what a high level politician had said to Cindy so that he could be held accountable and then
rubbing her shoulders in the car. I learned a lot about her— her shoe size, the sound of her voice
when she's talking to her children, her eating habits, her deep connection with her sister Dede,
her stamina and her vulnerability, as well as about her adaptability, her common sense and quick
mind and her salty and almost omnipresent sense of humor.</b></i>
