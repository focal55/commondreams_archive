<p>WASHINGTON - November 2 - Wildlife account for only a miniscule percentage 
            of cattle deaths and a tiny portion of sheep and goats losses, 
            according to new U.S. Department of Agricultural figures released 
            today by two environmental groups, Sinapu and Public Employees for 
            Environmental Responsibility (PEER). In fact, domestic dogs kill 
            more livestock than any other carnivore except coyotes.</P>
            <P>The figures raise questions about the utility of taxpayers 
            spending approximately $100 million per year on predation control. 
            Last year, a branch of USDA called Wildlife Services killed a record 
            2.7 million &#8220;nuisance&#8221; wildlife, including 75,674 coyotes, 3,907 
            foxes, 1,918 bobcats, 445 badgers, 397 black bears, 359 mountain 
            lions and 191 wolves, principally to benefit the livestock 
            industry.</P>
            <P>The USDA figures show that wildlife accounted for only two-tenths 
            of one percent of total cattle and calves lost per year. Wolves, 
            often the bugaboo of cattlemen, are responsible for fewer cattle 
            losses than any other predator (two-hundredths of one percent). 
            Total domestic cattle production is estimated at 97,309,000 per year 
            while wildlife predation amounts to only 147,000.</P>
            <P>&#8220;Our tax dollars are wasted financing an arsenal of airplanes, 
            poisons and traps to kill coyotes and bobcats,&#8221; stated PEER 
            Executive Director Jeff Ruch, noting that Congress is now looking 
            for ways to cut USDA&#8217;s budget to pay for Hurricane Katrina costs but 
            is looking at programs such as food stamps and wetlands protections. 
            &#8220;Federal wildlife control is an unjustified subsidy for the 
            livestock industry and should be one of the first cuts when it comes 
            to economizing.&#8221;</P>
            <P>For sheep and goats, 224,200 of an industry total of 7.65 million 
            animals (approximately three percent) were killed by mammalian and 
            avian carnivores, principally eagles, in 2004. Nearly twice as many 
            sheep and goats (approximately five percent) were lost due to 
            weather, age, theft, fire, poison and lambing complications.</P>
            <P>Coyotes are responsible for the majority of all livestock 
            predation. In response, USDA pays for an array of efforts that kill 
            between 75,000 and 90,000 coyotes each year. </P>
            <P>&#8220;The U.S. is engaged in an endless air and ground war against the 
            coyote but with little to show for it other than the carnage,&#8221; said 
            Wendy Keefover-Ring of Sinapu, pointing to research that many of the 
            coyotes taken are not involved in sheep kills. &#8220;It is high time to 
            begin exploring non-lethal means of wildlife control because what we 
            are currently doing makes little biological or economical 
sense.&#8221;</P>
            <P>Historically, USDA publishes livestock predation numbers without 
            providing baseline production numbers so that the significance or 
            lack thereof, of wildlife-caused losses was masked. Sinapu and PEER 
            have produced reports that combine the previously separated USDA 
            figures. </P><!-- #EndEditable -->
