<p>WASHINGTON - November 18 - Lawmakers in the House and Senate are now debating legislation to extend temporary
tax concessions for capital gains and dividend income. The tax loopholes, enacted in
2003 and scheduled to expire at the end of 2008, allow capital gains and dividend
income to be taxed at a top rate of 15 percent—less than half of the 35 percent top tax
rate on wages and other income. If these provisions expire, as current law provides,
dividends will once again be taxed at the same rates as other income, while the top
capital gains tax rate will revert to 20 percent.
A new state-by-state analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice shows that the lion’s share of
the benefits from extending these tax provisions would go to the wealthiest Americans.
<p>In particular:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Nationwide, the richest 1 percent of Americans, with an average income of
almost $1.3 million in 2009, would enjoy 53 percent of the tax cuts.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The average tax cut for this wealthiest group would exceed $12,000 in 2009.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The vast majority of Americans would receive nothing at all from extending
these special tax rates. 78 percent of Americans would get no tax cut, and an
additional 10 percent would get less than $100.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Extending tax breaks for unearned income would also worsen the nation’s fiscal
health, increasing federal budget deficits by $31 billion in 2009 alone. If these
cuts were made permanent, the long-term cost would be much higher. <br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“At a time when important public services for the poor are facing sharp reductions, it’s
hard to believe that Congress could see more tax cuts for the rich as a priority,” noted
CTJ Director Robert S. McIntyre. “We can only hope that more sensible members of
Congress will stop this misguided policy.”
