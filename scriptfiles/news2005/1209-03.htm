<p> WASHINGTON - December 9 - More than three 
              years before the 9/11 attack on the United States, U.S. officials               <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20051209/riyadh02085.pdf" target="_blank">warned Saudi 
              Arabia</a> that Osama bin Laden &quot;might take the course 
              of least resistance and turn to a civilian [aircraft] target,&quot; according to a <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20051209/riyadh02085.pdf" target="_blank">declassified 
              cable</a> released by the National Security Archive today. 
              The warning was made by the U.S. regional security officer and a 
              civil aviation official in Riyadh based on a public threat bin Laden 
              made against &quot;military passenger aircraft&quot; and his statement 
              that &quot;we do not differentiate between those dressed in military 
              uniforms and civilians.&quot; </p>

            <p>The State Department cable was not mentioned in the report of the 
              9/11 Commission, which investigated how U.S. intelligence failed 
              to detect planning for the terrorist attacks, using civilian airliners, 
              on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. It was obtained under 
              the Freedom of Information Act by Archive analyst Barbara Elias.</p>
<p> The National Security Archive released the cable, and a <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20051209/at_war.pdf" target="_blank">CIA 
              memorandum, &quot;We're at War,&quot; </a>written by then 
              director George Tenet, as it prepared to <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/anniversary/index.htm">commemorate 
              its 20th anniversary</a> on Friday. Obtaining the declassification 
              of these documents on the war on terrorism epitomized two decades 
              of work to bring transparency and accountability to relevant issues 
              in U.S. foreign policy, said Archive Executive Director Thomas Blanton. &quot;American citizens not only have a right to know, they have 
              a need to know.&quot;</p>
<p>In his urgent <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20051209/at_war.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;We're 
              at War&quot; memo</a> written five days after the 9/11 
              attacks to his top deputies, CIA Director George Tenet demanded 
              an urgent and &quot;unrelenting focus&quot; on &quot;bringing all 
              of our operational, analytical, and technical capabilities to bear-not 
              only to protect the US both here and abroad from additional terrorist 
              attacks-but also, and more importantly, to neutralize and destroy 
              al-Qa'ida and its partners.&quot;</p>

            <p>The confidential memo called for &quot;absolute and total dedication 
              as a leadership team&quot; and stated that he and his deputies would 
              &quot;translate the urgency of the difficult tasks ahead to the 
              men and women we lead by our behavior and actions.&quot; In waging 
              the war on terrorism, Tenet wrote, &quot;we must lead&#8230;. Never 
              has our professionalism and discipline been at a greater premium.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>The memo was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by 
              National Security Archive senior fellow, Jeffrey Richelson. It was 
              first identified in Bob Woodward's bestselling book, <em>Bush At 
              War</em>.</p>
