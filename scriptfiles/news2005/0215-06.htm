<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 15 -- The National Organization for Women is marking Freedom to Marry Week by launching a year-long Equal Marriage Campaign. NOW kicked off the campaign with a Feb. 14 trip to Capitol Hill where staff, interns and volunteers delivered educational materials to Members of Congress. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NOW is resolute in our commitment to winning equal marriage,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy. &quot;The goal of our campaign is to ensure that same-sex couples and their families have access to the full benefits and protections that only marriage can provide.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through the Equal Marriage Campaign, NOW will work to block passage of any constitutional amendment which denies marriage rights to same-sex couples; to repeal the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act; and to educate the public and policymakers about the importance of justice and equality for all families. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Feb. 14, Valentine's Day, U.S. senators and representatives received materials highlighting the issues of unequal access and economic injustice to which lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their families are subjected under current law. NOW plans to continue communicating with members of Congress and policymakers on this issue throughout the year. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to maintaining a presence on Capitol Hill, NOW chapters will engage in community organizing with a focus on creating a climate of justice, fairness and equality for all LGBT people and their families in neighborhoods across the country. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our aim is to strengthen and support the commitment of same-sex couples and their families, while securing for women the freedom to marry whomever they choose,&quot; said NOW Action Vice President Olga Vives. &quot;NOW's mission is to fight for civil and human rights for all women&#151;and equal marriage is a crucial part of that larger struggle.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
