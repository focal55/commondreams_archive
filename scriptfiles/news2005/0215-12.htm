<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- February 15 -- The Center for Constitutional Rights today demanded that President Bush and the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) disclose the details of a meeting held yesterday between the President and ICRC head Jakob Kellenberger.  Kellenberger reportedly met with Bush to reiterate ICRC concerns about detainees held at Guant&aacute;namo Bay.</font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) has long held that the conditions at Guant&aacute;namo are deplorable.  In 2004, CCR released The Tipton Report, written by three former detainees from the United Kingdom.  In the Report, the former detainees detail accounts of abuse and torture which they both endured and witnessed occur against other detainees.  The findings in that report are consistent with allegations of abuse detailed in documents released under the Freedom of Information Act to CCR and the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, Veterans for Common Sense, and Veterans for Peace.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICRC is the only organization that has clearance to regularly visit the U.S. naval base in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba.  A leaked report by the ICRC last year found evidence of torture tactics.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Torture is never acceptable, and holding secret meetings about it just compounds the horror,&#148; said CCR President, Michael Ratner.  &#147;We call on President Bush to reveal all they discussed. Absent transparency there will never be a full accounting for this unprecedented scandal that continues to mar America&#146;s image around the world.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;For the past few years, the ICRC has continued to bring their findings to an Administration that has consistently ignored them,&#148; stated Ron Daniels, Executive Director of the Center. &#147;While we understand that the ICRC conducts its work confidentially, we hope that given these particular circumstances they would reconsider keeping this information confidential. This Administration has been engaged in the systematic torture of detainees, holding them without access to courts and counsel until it releases them back to their country without charge. We must put an end to this cycle, appoint a Special Prosecutor on torture and conduct an immediate independent investigation into the conditions at Guant&aacute;namo.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center for Constitutional Rights successfully argued the original Guant&aacute;namo case, Rasul v. Bush, before the Supreme Court last spring.  Despite the 2004 ruling in their favor, the Bush Administration has consistently failed to comply with the Court&#146;s order resulting in further delayed legal proceedings.   The Center for Constitutional Rights recently filed John Doe v. Bush bringing the total number of individuals they represent at Guant&aacute;namo to over 570</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
