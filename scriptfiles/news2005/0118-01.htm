Bush. A  march will converge on Westlake Center around 2PM for a rally. Speakers, bands and performance art will be presented in an attempt to practice First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.weaponsofmassdistractionproject.org/" target="_new">The Weapons of Mass Distraction Project</a> will perform a skit, including amock debate between Kerry and Bush, followed by a satirical multi-media TV news broadcast exposing the conspiracy between corporate media and the government to whitewash the reports from Iraq and the botched elections ofBush and Christine Gregoire.Yes, there are many people who believe that the computer voting machine and GOP machinations in several states(including Ohio)resulted in aninaccurateelection rife with voting rights violations and voter suppression. Mnaysuspect that Bush was not the winner of the election. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 4PM a march will proceed to the federal building for a demonstration at 5PM. More speakers, political art and satire will be presented.
