<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 4 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), an internationally-recognized social justice organization, is participating in a hearing on the status of undocumented workers today in Washington, D.C. The Organization of American States&#146; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights will hear testimony about how the U.S. denies immigrant workers the most fundamental labor rights.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFSC supports the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of legal immigration status. As part of its Human Migration and Mobility Program, AFSC&#146;s Project Voice, the organization&#146;s national immigrants&#146; rights initiative, seeks to strengthen the voices of immigrants and immigrant-led organizations in setting the national agenda for immigration policy and immigrants&#146; rights.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This hearing marks an historic opportunity for claims of violations of international human rights in the U.S. to be heard and considered by an intergovernmental body,&#148; states Camilo Perez-Bustillo, director of human migration and mobility at the AFSC.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFSC is part of a coalition of over one hundred labor, civil rights and immigrants&#146; rights groups that have collected personal stories about mistreatment of undocumented workers by U.S. employers, and court rulings which limit their labor rights. These stories, which will be presented to the Commission, illustrate the threats and fear of retaliation that follow these workers to their jobs. Stories from workers in five AFSC regions representing six states (CA, CO, MA, MD, OR, PA) were among those submitted.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As undocumented workers&#146; rights to legal redress are being stripped away by U.S. Courts, this hearing represents an important opportunity for the voices of immigrant workers to be heard by the Inter-American Commission and the public at large. All too often, these voices are silenced by fear.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Lena&#148;, a chocolate factory worker from Pennsylvania, was among those who shared her story with the Commission. &#147;I was pregnant while working,&#148; she said, &#147;and I had to work the third shift. The supervisor told me that I had to lift the chocolate from the floor to the conveyor belt. It was so heavy, so I asked a friend to switch jobs with me, but the supervisor said no. She fired me. They didn&#146;t say why. I was just fired. I could not complain to anyone.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue of excluding undocumented workers from full [labor] protection[s] of their labor rights stems from a controversial U.S. Supreme Court ruling in March 2002. In Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, the Court held that an undocumented immigrant who is fired for organizing in defense of his or her rights is not entitled to compensation for lost pay.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the ruling, the government of Mexico requested an advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, which ruled in 2003 that failure to provide equal labor remedies to undocumented workers is incompatible with international human rights laws. Today&#146;s hearing will highlight the continued failure of U.S. law to protect the labor rights of these most vulnerable workers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The U.S. economy relies on undocumented immigrants for their labor, and yet these workers are vulnerable to untold abuse, exploitation, and discrimination due to their immigration status,&#148; states Joyce D. Miller, American Friends Service Committee assistant general secretary for justice and human rights. &#147;The basic human rights and dignity of these workers must be respected and upheld or, ultimately, the rights of all workers will be undermined.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For details on the hearing, contact: Felecia Bartow, AFSC&#146;s Project Voice documentation coordinator at 215-241-7133; or Sarah Paoletti, practitioner-in-residence, American University Washington College of Law International Human Rights Law Clinic at 202-274-4290. For media assistance, contact Janis D. Shields, director of media and public relations at 215-241-7060 or after hours at 302-545-6596.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
