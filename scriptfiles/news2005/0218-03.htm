<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 18 -- News Advisory: California business leaders, farmers and legislators will offer their support for a new industrial hemp farming bill at a press conference on Feb. 23 at 9 a.m. in the California State Capitol, room 1190. The press conference, hosted by Assemblyman Mark Leno, sponsor of the legislation, will feature various California based hemp businesses and outline why passage of the bill will help farmers and California's economy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Assemblyman Mark Leno, 13th District, (San Francisco)</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Candi Penn, executive director of the Hemp Industries Association<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> David Bronner, president of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps (Escondido)</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> John Roulac, president of Nutiva (Sebastopol-based Hemp Food Brand)</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives of Whole Foods Market and other speakers to be announced<br></font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Press Conference on New Industrial Hemp Legislation</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Wednesday, Feb. 23 at 9 a.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: California State Capitol, Room 1190, Sacramento</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From natural soap to healthy foods, a variety of &quot;Made in California&quot; hemp products will be available to the public and media to sample. In addition, a wide variety of hemp products from around the world will be on display. Two of the California hemp companies to speak at the press conference will disclose how many thousands of acres of hemp they already support in other countries to supply their businesses, all of which could be grown in California.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the second time an industrial hemp bill has been introduced in the California legislature. In 2002, a hemp research bill passed both the Assembly and Senate only to be vetoed by then Gov. Gray Davis. &quot;In 2002 we were very close to achieving hemp legislation,&quot; says Candi Penn, executive director of the Hemp Industries Association, which represents over 300 member companies. &quot;We hope that our Governor, who was born in a country where hemp farming is legal, will sign the legislation to the benefit of California's economy and environment.&quot; Support for hemp farming in California goes back to 1999 when Resolution HR32 was passed by the Assembly.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>If the new hemp bill becomes law, farmers would be able to apply for state licenses to grow hemp. The law would be similar to regulations on industrial hemp in other countries such as Canada and the European Union.
