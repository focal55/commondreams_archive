<p>WASHINGTON - December 5  - The Green Party called for the immediate release of four 
hostages who were seized in Baghdad on Saturday, November 26.  All are 
members of Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT); one of them, Tom Fox, is a 
member of the Virginia Green Party.

<p>"The four peaceworkers taken as hostages have put their lives on the line to 
help the Iraqi people and end the occupation," said Audrey Clement, Green 
Party of Virgnia delegate to the Green Party of the United States.  "We 
appeal especially to the Middle East media, including al Jazeera, to 
broadcast our request for the kidnappers to release the CPT hostages 
unharmed and as quickly as possible.  Holding them hostage serves no purpose 
-- please help us make it possible for Tom Fox and his fellow peace 
activists see their families again."

<p>The Green Party of the United States, like the Christian Peacemaker Teams, 
has strongly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and the Green Party has 
repeatedly called for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops occupying Iraq.

<p>Greens noted that the four CPT members were traveling unarmed and without 
bodyguards, which is inconsistent with the accusation that they are spies or 
acting in any capacity with the U.S. government or armed forces.

<p>Tom Fox, 54, resident of Clear Brook, Virginia, and a member of Langley Hill 
Friends Meeting, has been working with CPT in Baghdad documenting human 
rights abuses and promoting peace.  Most recently, he had been actively 
working to develop Muslim Peacemaking Teams in Baghdad.  Mr. Fox's web log 
can be read at <http://waitinginthelight.blogspot.com><a href="http://waitinginthelight.blogspot.com">http://waitinginthelight.blogspot.com</a>.

<p>An online petition for the release of the CPT hostages has been signed by 
authors Arundhati Roy and Tariq Ali; Denis Halliday, former U.N. Assistant 
Secretary General and Head of the U.N. Humanitarian Program in Iraq; antiwar 
activist Cindy Sheehan; Cindy and Craig Corrie, parents of Rachel Corrie, 
who was killed by Israeli military; Ralph Nader; historian Howard Zinn; Noam 
Chomsky; and thousands of others <a href="http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/freethecpt">http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/freethecpt</a><http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/freethecpt>.
