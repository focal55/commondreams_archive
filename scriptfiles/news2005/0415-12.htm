Weinberg is trade policy advisor at Oxfam. The group has helped organize April 10 to 16 as a "Global Week of Action for Trade Justice," which organizers estimate will involve more than 10 million people in 70 countries. Oxfam has just released a report titled "Kicking Down the Door," which finds that "the U.S., along with other rich countries and international financial institutions, is pressuring developing countries to open their markets for rice and other basic foods, while maintaining heavy subsidies and protections for its own producers. ... The Dominican Republic and Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) ... blatantly ignores the fact that U.S. farmers receive extensive subsidies and domestic supports, estimated to be around $18 billion this year alone."<br />
