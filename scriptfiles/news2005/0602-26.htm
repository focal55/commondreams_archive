<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Martha Burk, Chair of the National Council of Women's Organizations (NCWO), will introduce a shareholders resolution at Wal-Mart's annual meeting on Friday, June 3 in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  Wal-Mart is the nation's largest company, employing hundreds of thousands of women and minorities.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gender discrimination is alive and well across all sectors of the U.S. economy and working families are paying the price," said Burk, the leader of the nation's oldest and largest coalition of women's groups.  Burk's new
book:  Cult of Power: Sex Discrimination in Corporate America and What Can Be Done About It calls for Wal-Mart to correct gender pay disparities without waiting for the resolution of the largest gender discrimination suit in history. Burk and NCWO brought international attention to the hundreds of Fortune 500 corporate CEOs who condone discriminatory practices through memberships in Augusta National Golf Club.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution introduced by Burk focuses on potential discriminatory practices against women and minorities in Wal-Mart's distribution of stock options, and in awarding of restricted stock to employees.  This initiative is in partnership with Responsible Wealth (<a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org" target="_new">http://www.responsiblewealth.org</a>), a national network of affluent Americans who are concerned about deepening economic inequality and advocate widespread prosperity.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Widespread allegations of gender discrimination in pay and promotion by Wal-Mart are well documented," said Burk. "This resolution allows Wal-Mart to do the right thing - release information on stock option and restricted stock awards by gender and race to let the public know how these valuable forms of compensation are divided among employees."
 
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NCWO is aggressively targeting individual American companies that discriminate against women in pay, promotion, stock options and other forms of compensation.  In April NCWO facilitated a class action lawsuit alleging nationwide sex discrimination against Citigroup's Smith Barney.  Citigroup is the largest U.S. financial services firm.</font><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
