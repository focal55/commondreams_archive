      Brendan Smith is a lawyer and co-editor of the forthcoming book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805079696/commondreams-20/ref=nosim"><i>In 
The Name Of Democracy: American War Crimes in Iraq and Beyond</i></a>." He said 
today: "On May 17 a legal summons was delivered to U.S. and UK embassies in 
capitals around the world on behalf of the World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI). 
The summons requested the attendance of President Bush and Prime Minister 
Blair to defend charges that they are in 'violation of common values of 
humanity, international treaties, and international law' for waging war in 
Iraq. The Istanbul session to which Bush and Blair are invited is the 
culminating tribunal of WTI's held in Paris, Tokyo, New York, and elsewhere 
around the world. While the summons was signed by leading international 
figures, including international legal scholar Richard Falk and former UN 
Assistant Secretary General Dennis Halliday, President Bush's attendance is 
not anticipated."<br>
<br>
Smith added: "In 1967, the British philosopher Bertrand Russell 
convened the International War Crimes Tribunal. The Tribunal was charged 
with conducting 'a solemn and historic investigation' of U.S. war crimes in 
Vietnam in order to 'prevent the crime of silence.' Drawing on this 
tradition, the WTI -- composed of lawyers, former parliamentarians and 
judges, journalists, artists, and victims of U.S. aggression -- has held 
people's tribunals on multiple continents in order to compile 'a moral, 
political, and judicial record that contributes to build[ing] a world of 
peace and justice.'"<br>
