<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 28 -- Amnesty International USA applauds the U.S. initiatives to promote human rights outlined in the Department of State's annual human rights policy assessment, Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The U.S. Record: 2004-2005, but warns that as long as the White House continues to flout international law and blatantly disregard the Geneva Conventions, many of its policies to promote democracy and human rights will be greeted with deep skepticism. &quot;Last year's report was postponed following release of the horrific photos from Abu Ghraib, which cast a shadow on the report's legitimacy by calling the United State's own human rights record into question,&quot; said Alexandra Arriaga, Director of Government Relations for Amnesty International USA. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. authority to promote human rights abroad diminishes every time it sanctions rendition, refuses to thoroughly investigate detainee abuse, denies its citizens access to an attorney or habeas corpus, or approves small arms shipments to countries with abysmal human rights records. The U.S. loses its moral voice on human rights every day it continues to detain without charge or trial the hundreds of individuals held at Guantanamo Bay, most believed to be innocent of crimes and swept up in a dragnet. The Department of State is right to herald its human rights achievements, but its worthy efforts are undercut by the administration's overall approach, making its report tantamount to a business ethics manual published by Enron.&quot; Amnesty International urges the White House to hold U.S. agents and officers accountable to international law and calls for a thorough, independent inquiry into domestic allegations of detainee abuse and torture as well as in U.S. detention centers in Iraq, Afghanistan and Cuba. Amnesty International calls for those detained in U.S. custody in Iraq, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere to be charged and tried in fair and public trials that meet international standards for justice or to be released.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The human rights organization also calls for an end to extraordinary renditions,the outsourcing of torture to other nations, and for the immediate cessation of all small arms transfers to countries with questionable human rights records. The Department of State's Supporting Human Rights and Democracy report details actions taken by the U.S. government to encourage respect for human rights. The report complements the annual Country Reports on </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Practices, released on February 28, 2005.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
