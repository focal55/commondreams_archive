<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 21 - The Green Party of Louisiana today issued a strong condemnation of plans to 
suspend U.S. environmental protections in the wake of the Katrina disaster.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The first disaster to hit our state was a natural one.  The one following 
suspension of EPA rules will be a human-generated environmental disaster," 
Leenie Halbert, Co-Chair of the Louisiana Green Party warned.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A U.S. Senate proposal introduced Thursday would grant the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) administrator the authority to waive or modify 
requirements for any emergency response related to Hurricane Katrina. The 
blanket proposal, introduced by Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), applies to any 
project carried out by the EPA.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halbert predicted that relaxation of environmental safeguards will lead to 
an unknown, but predictable, increase in the death rate in the lower 
Mississippi Valley, and stated that a limited suspension of EPA rules to 
allow burning of some wastes would be sufficient for the needs to clean up 
this region.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is no reason why there needs to be a complete waiver of EPA 
protection for the entire Mississippi Valley for a period of a year and a 
half," she said.  "Furthermore, the EPA has been extremely slow in 
initiating testing of soil and water samples in the storm-damaged areas and 
we question if in any case the agency has the will to demand that pollution 
be kept in check during this period."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our people already are suffering from living in what is known as 'Cancer 
Alley,'" Halbert said.  "Now, they have suffered the loss of their homes and 
the neglect-seen on televisions worldwide-of their basic needs in time of 
disaster.  But this is not enough for the right-wing idealogues who control 
our institutions in Washington, and our people are once more going to be 
betrayed by this Administration."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate Committee on Public Works, which met behind closed doors with EPA 
officials after the hurricane, claims that the waiver is needed during 
clean-up of the disaster, according to Bill Holbrook, from the majority 
staff of the committee.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halbert quoted officials of the environmental law firm Earthjustice, who say 
that the waiver of eighteen months is too long a time for environmental 
protections to be suspend, and echoed their concerns about the proposed 
waiver which includes occupational health and safety laws applying to debris 
disposal, water management and reconstruction workers coming to the area.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This entire maneuver is nothing more than a cynical attempt to use this 
disaster to achieve the dismantling of laws and procedures that have been 
created to protect our people," Halbert warned.</font></P>
