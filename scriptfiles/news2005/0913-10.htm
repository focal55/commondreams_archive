<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->PORTLAND - September 13 - According to environmental groups in the region, a preliminary proposal from the region’s governors to cap global warming pollution from electric power industry falls short of what is necessary to make progress on pollution reductions from the power plants themselves.

<p>“The plan on the table needs improvement,” said Matthew Davis, Advocate for Environment Maine. “There are loopholes in it that will keep the governors from achieving their stated goal of reducing pollution from power plants.”

<p>A report released today by a coalition of northeast environmental groups, <a href="http://environmentmaine.org/envmaine.asp?id2=19062" target="_new">Cracks in the Cap: How the Offsets Loophole Undermines the Control of Global Warming Pollution from Power Plants</a>, pointed to a pollution trading loophole that advocates say would let power plant owners off the hook by allowing tree planting, or reductions in other sectors not regulated by the program as a means of getting their reductions, rather than requiring pollution reductions at the power plants themselves.

<p>“We need to focus on cleaning up the oldest, dirtiest power plants, rather than setting up shell games that delay pollution reductions,” said Jennifer Andersen, Outreach Coordinator for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. “That’s the only way we’re going to get the deep pollution reductions we need in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.”

<p>At the outset of negotiations on the power sector carbon cap in 2004, the states agreed to initially limit the program to reducing global warming pollution from the electric power generators in the northeast. However, negotiators are now revisiting that principle and considering five categories of pollution “offsets”—pollution reductions outside the regional electricity sector that would offset excess pollution from power plants. The report concludes that so-called pollution “offsets” are likely to erode the integrity of the proposed cap-and-trade program.

<p>“The plan to cut power plant pollution is the keystone of Maine’s Climate Action Plan,” said Davis. “Offsets, or alleged reductions, may not be of legitimate value and determining whether they are or not may not be worth the time and effort. There's an easier way to get this done.”

<p>Environmentalists have also criticized the governors for failing to adequately embrace energy efficiency measures that would enable greater pollution reductions at lower cost.

<p>“The governors are only a few steps away from creating a program that will cut pollution and shift the region toward a cleaner energy future,” said Andersen. “That’s why it’s so important that the program be designed right.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
