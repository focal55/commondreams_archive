<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 9 - The Senate's confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown for
   the DC Circuit Court of Appeals could have serious and long-term impacts
   on the nation's environmental protections.  Justice Brown's avowed
   hostility to laws that protect our air, water, and lands and her
   tendency to rule based on personal philosophy make her unfit to serve on
   the D.C. Circuit, which handles a vast number of cases involving federal
   environmental safeguards.

</font>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is ironic that the Senate voted to confirm a judge with such clear
   contempt for Federal laws which protect our civil rights, workers'
   rights, and the environment," said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the
   Sierra Club. "The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has a unique role in
   protecting our water, air, and natural heritage.  Justice Brown poses a
   serious threat to those protections."

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Justice Brown is opposed to federal government regulation, including
   environmental protections.  She interprets the Constitution in such a
   way that virtually all environmental regulation could be ruled
   unconstitutional.  According to Brown, government destroys families,
   takes property, is the cause of a "debased, debauched culture," and
   threatens civilization.  In addition, the California Judicial
   Nominations Evaluation Commission twice gave Brown a "not qualified"
   rating, reflecting a lack of needed judicial temperament and intolerance
   for opposing philosophical positions.

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the wake of Justice Brown's confirmation, the Sierra Club urges
   Senators to oppose the confirmation of William Pryor to the Eleventh
   Circuit Court of Appeals.  Mr. Pryor has a clear record of trying to
   undermine the federal government's right to protect the environment.

  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Mr.  Pryor has taken stands against the Endangered Species Act, wetlands
   protection, and environmental justice.  He does not believe Congress has
   authority  to  regulate  the  environment  or  natural  resources.   His
   previous  nomination was rushed through the Judiciary Committee before a
   full  investigation  into  his fund-raising for the Republican Attorneys
   General  Association  (RAGA),  actions  which  may have violated Alabama
   campaign finance laws.

   </font><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Sierra Club opposes Mr. Pryor's confirmation because of his strong
   opposition to the laws that protect America's clean air, water and
   wildlife," said Pope.  "But certainly the Senate should at least know
   the full facts behind the fund-raising practices Mr. Pryor engaged in
before voting."</font><p align="CENTER"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
