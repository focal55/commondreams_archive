<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 4 -- As G-7 Finance Ministers gathered for a meeting in London today with debt cancellation for impoverished nations on their agenda, Jubilee USA Network today issued the following statement:

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the leaders of the world's richest nations gather this weekend in London, Jubilee USA Network is encouraged to see that debt cancellation is on the G-7's agenda and that leaders are considering up to 100% multilateral debt cancellation, a longtime demand of Jubilee USA Network.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the time for more speeches, rhetoric, and delay by the G-7 is over. We will judge our government and the rest of the G-7 based upon the commitments they make to support 100% multilateral debt cancellation for all impoverished nations, without devastating conditions. More rhetoric, more delay, or more excuses are not acceptable.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Delay is unacceptable when Africa sends $15 billion a year to wealthy creditors. Delay is unfathomable when the poorest nations continue to spend more on debt service payments to the IMF and World Bank than on health care for their own people, while 3 million people will die in Africa this year from the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Debt cancellation is not a controversial or radical concept: it is a simple matter of life and death for millions. 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Nelson Mandela said yesterday in London, "In this new century, millions of people in the world's poorest countries remain imprisoned, enslaved, and in chains. They are trapped in the prison of poverty. It is time to set them free. Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debt cancellation is a critical first step to breaking the chains of poverty. As the debts have been repaid many times over, cancellation is fundamentally an act of justice rather than charity.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Delay is not acceptable given the terrible devastation wrought by the Asian Tsunami. Last year, governments of Tsunami affected countries repaid $38 billion to creditors, much of which went to G-7 nations and the multilateral financial institutions they control. The $6 billion in international aid pledged to address to disaster pales in comparison the amount these nations are making in debt payments. The moratorium proposed by the G-7 is wholly insufficient - is only temporary and does not even include payments to the IMF and World Bank. Jubilee USA Network supports calls by civil society in Tsunami and other disaster affected nations for full debt cancellation.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The response of the IMF and World Bank to the crisis of poor country debt to date - the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) -- has failed to provide the exit to the debt crisis it promised and should be abandoned.  Countries have barely reduced their debt service payments through this program. It is time for a bold new approach.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past weeks and months, a diverse array of people and organizations have lined up to demand action on 100% cancellation. In the US, 70 Members of Congress joined Jubilee USA Network, the US Catholic Conference of Bishops, InterAction, and leading charities like CARE, Save the Children, and World Vision to demand action this weekend. Calls elsewhere in the world for action by Nelson Mandela, the African Union, Bono, and the Pope have amplified the voices of social movements and campaigners around the world that have been demanding freedom from debt domination for decades.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee USA Network will evaluate whatever announcement emerges from this weekend's talks on the following criteria: 1. Immediate action. Delay on full debt cancellation in unacceptable and will cost thousands of lives. 
2. 100% cancellation. We call for full (100%) debt stock cancellation for impoverished nations. Proposals put forward by the UK and Canada would not cancel debt stock, but only relieve debt service payments for 10 years. 3. Leave no country behind. It is critical that debt cancellation apply to all impoverished nations, not simply those that qualify for the IMF/World Bank's HIPC Initiative. Nations affected by the Tsunami and other natural disasters must see full cancellation. 4. No economic conditions on debt cancellation. Conditions on debt relief by the IMF/World Bank have devastated nations' economies. Debt cancellation must come without externally imposed conditions on impoverished nations. Civil society in impoverished nations must be empowered to ensure accountability in the use of funds released by debt cancellation. 5. IMF/World Bank: Pay Your Fair Share. The IMF can sell gold and raise more than $30 billion to finance cancellation of IMF and World Bank debt. The World Bank can mobilize at least $17 billion in accumulated and future profits for debt cancellation. These are compromise approaches to financing cancellation that G-7 nations should support.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Above all, we will judge the G-7 based on their deeds rather than their words. To our own government we say: You must return to the US with a deal for full multilateral debt cancellation. We have been encouraged by your rhetorical support of debt cancellation, but without negotiation and commitment, words mean nothing to the thousands who die each month because resources are flowing out of their countries in illegitimate debt payments.

Jubilee USA Network also notes that any announcement on multilateral debt cancellation for impoverished nations that emerges from the G-7 would be only the first step - an important first step - on a much longer journey towards freedom from debt. The discussion in the G-7 now only applies to a very particular type of debt (multilateral) for the very poorest nations. Debt cancellation and freedom from debt domination is urgent for nations across the global South for many types of debts. Our work will continue and draw attention to these issues regardless of the outcome of this weekend's meeting.</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><div align="CENTER"></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
