<p>WASHINGTON - December 8 - “I will do everything I can, including a filibuster, to stop this Patriot Act conference report, which does not include adequate safeguards to protect our constitutional freedoms.  The version of the Patriot Act that was signed today is a major disappointment.  I appreciate that it includes four-year sunsets on three controversial provisions, but merely sunsetting bad law is not adequate.  We need to make substantive changes to the law, and without those changes I am confident there will be strong, bipartisan opposition here in the Senate. 

<p>This isn't about stopping Patriot Act reauthorization.  The President could sign Patriot Act reauthorization legislation into law tomorrow if the House would just take up and pass the compromise Senate bill that was approved unanimously in the Senate earlier this year – a bill that includes important and reasonable privacy protections.  The conference committee had the opportunity to fix many of the provisions of the Patriot Act to which Americans across the political spectrum have voiced their opposition over the last four years.  Unfortunately, they decided not to listen.  This battle is not over.”
