<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- March 29 --  As the guest blogger from April 4 through April 15 at the new NRDC Action Fund Blog (<a href="http://blog.nrdcactiofund.org/" target="_new">http://blog.nrdcactiofund.org</a>), New York Times best-selling author T.A. Barron will share his observations on the environment, politics, and children.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barron&#146;s passion for the wonders of nature, and his belief in the heroic potential of every person, radiate through his books, many of which are international bestsellers. His award-wining novels, read by children and adults alike, include his new trilogy The Great Tree of Avalon (a New York Times bestseller), The Lost Years of Merlin (currently being developed into a feature film), and The Ancient One (the story of a brave teenage girl and a great redwood tree).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barron devotes significant time to supporting conservation causes, frequently speaking and writing about the environment. &#147;As a nation, we are what we save,&#148; Barron wrote in The Boston Globe. &#147;The value of America's public lands cannot be measured in board feet, tons of coal, or sales of all-terrain vehicles. Once wilderness is lost, it is lost forever. And the biggest losers will be generations of Americans yet unborn.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hosted by the NRDC Action Fund's own Frances Beinecke, the NRDC Action Fund Blog (<a href="http://blog.nrdcactionfund.org/" target="_new">http://blog.nrdcactionfund.org/</a>) gives readers the chance to exchange comments, participate in online chats, and get organized to take action. With personal reflections and a fresh look at the issues, Beinecke calls attention to the dangers posed by the Bush Administration's policies and tells readers about what they can do to help stop them.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About the NRDC Action Fund</i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRDC Action Fund is spearheading the fight for America&#146;s environment on Capitol Hill. A non-profit organization operating under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, the Action Fund is leading a massive campaign, funded by ordinary Americans, to halt and reverse the Bush Administration&#146;s corporate-sponsored, anti-environmental agenda.</font></i></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About NRDC</font></i></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) -- the parent organization of the NRDC Action Fund -- is the nation's most effective environmental action organization.
