<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 14 -- In preparation for the upcoming G7, World Bank and IMF meetings, economists Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) are available to discuss globalization, debt, trade and other economic issues. To schedule an interview, call 202-293-5380 x115.<br> <br>CEPR has called attention to numerous international economic problems that are now widely recognized. For example, the World Bank recently pointed out the risks to developing countries of holding dollar reserves (&quot;Poor nations with big dollar reserves risk great losses, World Bank warns,&quot; Financial Times, April 7, 2005). CEPR calculated these potential losses in September 2004 in its report, &quot;Going Down With the Dollar: The Cost to Developing Countries of a Declining Dollar.&quot;  CEPR was also the first think tank to call attention to the sharp slowdown in growth in most developing countries over the last 25 years. This is now becoming a major political issue, especially in Latin America.<br> <br><b>EXPERTS</b><br> <br><b>MARK WEISBROT</b> is Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
