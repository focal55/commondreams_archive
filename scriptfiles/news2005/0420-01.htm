<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 20 --  Congressman Mark Udall (D-Eldorado Springs) today pressed the Secret Service to provide the name of the individual who ejected three Coloradans from President Bush's Social Security town hall in Denver on March 21.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Udall made his request as a result of a letter he received from the Secret Service on April 19, which states that an agent was not responsible for removing the three Coloradans from the event.  The Secret Service letter does not indicate who this person is, or whether the department has taken any action to determine if the individual posed as a Secret Service agent or law enforcement officer. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While it is certainly helpful to know that a Secret Service agent was not engaged in evicting a law-abiding member of the public from an event that was paid for and organized with tax payer dollars, and while I am relieved to know that the Secret Service was not engaged in a partisan purpose, I am still interested in knowing the identity of the individual involved, and more importantly, what your department did, if anything, to determine whether this person unlawfully posed as a law enforcement official,&quot; said Udall in his letter to Mr. Conrad A. Everett, Deputy Assistant Director of the Secret Service.  &quot;If you cannot identify the person involved, I would like to know what provision of law prevents you from doing so.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 31, Udall asked White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card to look into allegations of inappropriate behavior by the White House advance team at the Denver town hall and to take steps to ensure that no one is improperly removed from participating in similar events in the future.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Udall concluded by saying: &quot;The American people deserve answers.  The Secret Service is in the business of protecting the president and not in the business of protecting the Republican party.&quot;<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Copy of Letter:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">April 19, 2005</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Conrad A.

While it is certainly helpful to know that a Secret Service agent was not engaged in evicting a law-abiding member of the public from an event that was paid for and organized with tax payer dollars, and while I am relieved to know that the Secret Service was not engaged in a partisan purpose, I am still interested in knowing the identity of the individual involved, and more importantly, what your department did, if anything, to determine whether this person unlawfully posed as a law enforcement official.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a conversation my staff had with Secret Service officials in Washington, D.C., I was under the impression that your letter of response would answer these concerns.  If you cannot identify the person involved, I would like to know what provision of law prevents you from doing so.  I am also interested in knowing what steps were taken, if any, to determine whether someone in authority at the president's town meeting unlawfully posed as a member of the Secret Service.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                                                            Sincerely yours,</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U</font></p><p>                                                            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                                                            Mark E.
