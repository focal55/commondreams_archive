<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 16 -- US Representatives Barbara Lee (D-CA) and Lynn Woolsey (D-CA), co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), announced today the hire of veteran Hill professional Bill Goold to be the Caucus' first full-time Progressive Policy Advisor.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bill will be an incredible asset to the Congressional Progressive Caucus,&quot; said Rep. Woolsey.  &quot;His legislative and grassroots experience will help our Progressive Caucus increase our visibility and move a progressive agenda forward on Capitol Hill.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am proud to announce that the Progressive Caucus will have its first full time staff member, Bill Goold,&quot; said Rep. Lee.  &quot;Bill will bring a wealth of both practical experience and commitment to progressive values to the position of Progressive Policy Advisor, and we are looking forward to working with him.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goold is an alumni of Oberlin College and George Washington University, and worked in Ohio state government before moving to D.C. in 1977, when he was hired for legislative work by U.S. Congressman Don Pease (D-Ohio).  Cumulatively, he has more than 26 years of experience working in Congress for U.S. Congressmen Pease, George Brown, Bernie Sanders, Rush Holt, and U.S. Senator Tom Harkin. Goold also worked as Senior Policy Advisor in the International Affairs Department of the AFL-CIO and Deputy Director for Global Programs in the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hiring a full time staff person of Goold's qualifications is an important step in realizing Lee and Woolsey's vision of strengthening the CPC and making it a more effective voice for progressive values in Congress. As Progressive Policy Advisor, Goold will serve as the primary point of contact for the Democratic Leadership, Members of Congress and other caucuses on all Congressional Progressive Caucus issues.  He will also be charged with developing and implementing a comprehensive communications strategy and coordinating CPC policy outreach to progressive organizations.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a growing number of people who are getting involved with politics because they are drawn to the basic principles of fairness and justice that the Progressive Caucus has long represented in Congress,&quot; said Rep. Lee. &quot;Adding a staff member of Bill's experience will allow the Progressive Caucus to more effectively continue our commitment to these principles, to build stronger connections with young people and communities of color and to strengthen the role of the Progressive Caucus in giving voice to this emerging progressive majority.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Representative Lee and I look forward to bringing Bill Goold on-board,&quot; said Rep. Woolsey.  &quot;Bill's commitment to progressive values - social justice, fairness, and strengthening community - is clear.   He will bring fresh ideas to help re-energize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and re-energize the progressive wing of the Democratic party.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This will mark Goold's second stint of staff service to the Progressive Caucus. He worked as part-time Staff Coordinator for the CPC while serving as Washington Staff Director for U.S. Congressman Bernie Sanders between 1994 and 1998.  During that period, CPC membership doubled to 60 members and the Caucus crafted The Progressive Promise, the first comprehensive, 10-bill alternative to the Contract with America.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During his tenure on the Hill, Goold has focused on issues of social and economic justice and making respect for fundamental human rights, worker rights, and environmental sustainability a critical component of both domestic and foreign policy.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I look forward to working with Caucus Co-Chairs Lynn Woolsey and Barbara Lee and all of the Progressive Caucus Members and staff to build a stronger progressive movement inside and outside of Congress with a clear alternative agenda that offers more hope and security to all,&quot; said Goold.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
