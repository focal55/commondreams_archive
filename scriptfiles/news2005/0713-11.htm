<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 13 - American Rights at Work today launched WalMartWorkersRights.org, a website spotlighting the retail giant&#146;s unfair practices in the workplace.  The site will also serve as a platform to enable the public to communicate their opposition to Wal-Mart&#146;s anti-union behavior.</font></p><p></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;When Wal-Mart employees attempt to stand up for themselves and try to form a union, they face threats, propaganda, discrimination, intimidation, and even firings in retaliation,&#148; said David Bonior, Chair of American Rights at Work.  &#147;Why won&#146;t Wal-Mart give its workers a free choice and a fair chance to form a union?&#148; </font></p><p></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wal-Mart&#146;s efforts to squash unionization in its stores are swift and overwhelming: </font></p><p> </p><ul><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The company taps into calls and emails from stores around the country to monitor whether anyone is talking about forming a union.</font><br></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Store officials receive a toolkit to &#147;Remaining Union Free&#148; and are encouraged to call a hotline at the first sign of any interest in a union.<br></font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wal-Mart dispatches a rapid-response anti-union squad at any indication of its employees considering union formation.</font></li></ul><p></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wal-Mart employees who simply want to negotiate for decent wages, affordable health care, and basic protections on the job encounter huge obstacles and overwhelming resistance.  The company&#146;s employees earn 25 percent less than workers with union representation in comparable positions.  Many have no health insurance at all, resorting to Medicaid and other state programs in order to provide coverage for their families.  </font></p><p></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Wal-Mart employees &#150; many of them college students, single parents, the elderly &#150; barely make enough to cross the poverty line, while Wal-Mart rakes in billions in profits,&#148; said Mary Beth Maxwell, Executive Director of American Rights at Work.  &#147;It&#146;s time to tell Wal-Mart that enough is enough, and that is why we are urging the public to speak out by visiting <a href="http://www.walmartworkersrights.org" target="_new">WalMartWorkersRights.org</a>.&#148;</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
