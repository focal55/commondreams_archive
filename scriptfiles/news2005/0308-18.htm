<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 8 -- For more than three years, law enforcement leaders, policy experts, reasonable members of Congress and advocacy groups have been arguing that bills passed by Congress and policies set by the Bush White House were going to make it easy for terrorist organizers to arm themselves for attacks against innocent Americans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the inner circle in power in the nation's capital wore blinders, singularly focused on delivering victories for the National Rifle Association.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, Americans are learning the price that we've paid to please a special interest. And it's very, very disturbing,&quot; said Michael Barnes, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence united with the Million Mom March. &quot;The report issued by the Government Accountability Office makes it painfully clear that there are people who hate America who have become stronger because of the gun policies of the last four years.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress is planning to move as rapidly as possible to deliver another prize to the NRA: unprecedented legal immunity for gun sellers, even if their negligence arms criminals and terrorists. The ludicrously named &quot;Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act&quot; has been reintroduced in the Senate (S. 397) with 42 cosponsors and the House (H.R. 800) with 141 cosponsors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past four years, the Bush Administration and Congress have taken numerous steps to satisfy the extreme gun lobby which only benefit criminals and terrorists, including the following:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Required that Brady background check records be destroyed within 24 hours - a move that was opposed by the FBI Agents Association, which said &quot;the more the retention period is reduced, the more difficult it would become to use the paperwork to investigate or prosecute crimes related to the use of sales of the firearms in question. Any such efforts can only complicate the already difficult task of law enforcement and jeopardize public safety.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prevented Federal law enforcement agencies from requiring that gun dealers conduct inventories. This curtails investigations of dealers who show a continued pattern of selling weapons that are swiftly used in connection with crimes.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allowed the expiration of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, making weapons like Uzis, AK-47s and concealable Tec-9s, as well as high capacity magazines that can hold up to 100 rounds, legal again.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush must take a stronger stand against criminals and terrorists by reversing these policies,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;And it's simply incredible to think that leaders in Congress, instead of addressing these loopholes, would be doing more of the bidding of the extreme gun lobby.&quot; </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
