<p>WASHINGTON - October 20 - Congressman Souder's draconian Methamphetamine Epidemic Elimination Act, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.03889:">HR 3889</a>, is scheduled to be marked up by the House Crime Subcommittee next week, with the broader Judiciary Committee marking it up at the beginning of November. This is an ominous sign that Congress is moving towards a vote on the bill.

<p>While methamphetamine is a serious problem, HR 3889 does not present any real solutions. It is instead typical drug war zealot lock-'em-up legislation that drastically lowers the trigger amounts for mandatory minimum sentences for methamphetamine offenses.

<p>HR 3889 would lower the amount of methamphetamine it takes to get a five-year mandatory sentence from 5 grams to 3 grams (about a sugar packet’s worth). It would lower the amount of methamphetamine it takes to get a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence from 50 grams to 5 grams (about a thimbelful).

<p>We know that stiffer mandatory minimums do not reduce drug use. Similar penalties enacted for crack cocaine in the 1980s devastated tens of thousands of families and wasted tens of billions of dollars. Although the new mandatory minimums would not apply to simple possession, they would be so low that many methamphetamine users would be charged with “possession with intent to distribute” for an amount most likely intended for personal use.

<p>This bill would ruin lives and squander your tax dollars. Congress is feeling a lot of pressure to pass methamphetamine-related legislation right now, but it is important that legislators consider the effects of the laws they approve because a counter-productive solution is no solution at all.

<p>Help your member of Congress resist the temptation to pass this bill just for the sake of saying he or she has done something to fight meth. If you are not one of the over 3,000 people who have already sent messages to their representatives in Congress, please <a href="http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=28147&MS=MethElimBill-102005-ip" target="_new">do so now</a>!
