<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - The following was released today by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence regarding Supreme Court Nominee Samuel Alito and the machine gun ban:</p>
<p>   In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the McClure-Volkmer Act, which severely weakened federal gun laws, but had one redeeming provision: it banned transfer and possession of machine guns not legally owned when the Act went into effect. </p>
<p>   Since then, criminals have repeatedly tried to escape culpability for illegal possession of machine guns by arguing that the ban is unconstitutional.  The courts have unanimously upheld the law as constitutional; every Circuit Court of Appeal to consider the issue has upheld the ban, and the Supreme Court has consistently refused to consider any cases challenging its constitutionality.  (Some of the cases are listed below.)  </p>
<p>   But if Judge Samuel Alito's view had prevailed, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals would have struck the law down as unconstitutional in 1996.  On this issue, Judge Alito is far outside the mainstream of American constitutional jurisprudence.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Judge Alito's decision reeks of right wing judicial activism, a willingness to concoct bizarre readings of the law in order to strike down reasonable laws with which he disagrees,&quot; said Michael Barnes.  &quot;If even a no-brainer like the machine gun ban doesn't meet Judge Alito's standards, it appears that Justice Alito would try to neuter the ability of the people's representatives to enact all manner of sensible gun legislation.&quot;</p>
<p>   In the machine gun case, United States v. Rybar, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), the defendant, a federally licensed firearms dealer, had sold two illegal machine guns at a Pennsylvania gun show. </p>
<p>   Alito argued that the machine gun ban violated the Commerce Clause. Judge Alito's unusual reading of the Commerce Clause was ridiculed by his colleagues on the bench, who suggested that Alito's reasoning violated &quot;a basic tenet of the constitutional separation of powers.&quot;  The majority stated that Alito did not give the proper &quot;deference that the judiciary owes to its two coordinate branches of government, a basic tenet of the constitutional separation of powers.&quot;  The judges chided Alito for demanding that &quot;Congress or the Executive play Show and Tell with the federal courts at the peril of invalidation of a Congressional statute.&quot;</p>
