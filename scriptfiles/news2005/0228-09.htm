<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 28 -- The U.S. Forest Service allowed the timber industry to rewrite a comprehensive plan for managing 11 national forests in California, according to a legal claim made today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). PEER is filing to intervene in a California Forestry Association lawsuit that seeks to triple the annual timber harvest from national forests in the Sierra Nevada &#150; an increased rate of logging that the Bush Administration is also seeking through an administrative route by its rewrite of the Sierra management plan.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PEER is acting to prevent the Bush Administration and the timber industry from cementing in the higher logging levels through a settlement of the industry suit brought against the Forest Service in Washington, D.C. PEER contends that, despite the suggestion of a disagreement implied by a lawsuit, the industry and the Bush Administration actually agree with each other and that a friendly settlement of the suit would insulate their deal from legal challenges brought by conservation groups.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Forest Service is now run by a former timber industry lobbyist, Mark Rey, whose mission, before he returns to the private sector, is to radically undercut sustainable forest policies,&#148; stated California PEER Director Karen Schambach. &#147;The years of work that went into developing the Sierra Framework of 2001, a model plan of which the Forest Service should have been proud, were chucked out the window with barely a wink and a nod.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2004, the Bush Administration scrapped the Sierra Framework of 2001, covering 11.5 million acres, in its entirety. According to the declaration filed by PEER, the Forest Service &#150;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Had an &#147;open door&#148; policy for the timber industry in developing the 2004 rewrite. The Forest Service conducted no public hearings, in contrast to the 2001 plan which was produced after 60 public hearings;</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Repeatedly overruled its own specialists and misused data in order to justify unsupportable timber harvest levels; and</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drove its scientists who disagreed with the increased logging targets out of the agency. In one instance, a specialist found himself blackballed from obtaining employment as a private consultant.<br></font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In this the centennial year of the U.S. Forest Service, the agency leadership has disgraced the agency&#146;s legacy and should be ashamed of themselves,&#148; added Schambach, noting that the timber industry lawsuit filed last December in Washington, D.C. targeted the 2001 Sierra Framework, not the new Bush plan. Jenner &amp; Block, a national law firm, is representing PEER in this action.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this month, the California Attorney General and a coalition of conservation groups filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sacramento that directly challenges the legality of the Bush Administration&#146;s 2004 Sierra plan. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Read PEER&#146;s motion to intervene<br><a href="http://www.peer.org/docs/ca/2005_28_2_intervention.pdf%20" target="_new">http://www.peer.org/docs/ca/2005_28_2_intervention.pdf </a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">See PEER&#146;s declaration in support of the motion<br><a href="http://www.peer.org/docs/ca/2005_28_2_schambach_filing.pdf" target="_new">http://www.peer.org/docs/ca/2005_28_2_schambach_filing.pdf</a> <br></font> </p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
