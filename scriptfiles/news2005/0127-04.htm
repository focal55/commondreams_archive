<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 27 -- Judge Faircloth sentenced six more of the &quot;SOA 14&quot;, bringing to 11 the total number of activists ordered to serve prison terms of three to six months and to pay fines of up to $500. Each of the defendants was on trial for acts of nonviolent civil disobedience calling for the closure of the School of the Americas (SOA/ WHINSEC). The two high school students in the group were given deferred sentences, and another defendant was sentenced to one year of probation with a $1,000 fine.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fourteen people that were on trial before Judge G. Mallon Faircloth this week range in age from 16 to 79. The group includes a chaplain, a farmworker, a Maryknoll nun, a Steelworker, two retirees and several students. They were all arrested on Sunday, November 21 for &quot;crossing the line&quot; onto Fort Benning, Georgia to call for the closure of SOA/ WHINSEC, a combat training facility for Latin American security personnel.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each defendant opted to self-report to prison and will now wait for a letter from the Bureau of Prisons notifying them of the date when and prison to which they must report. Past defendants have received notice from the BoP anywhere from six to twelve weeks after their trials.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These defendants will spend the next months spreading the word about the School of the Americas by doing media outreach, speaking to churches, synagogues and peace and justice organizations in their communities and lobbying their Members of Congress.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many are already making their plans to be in DC on February 21-22 for the SOA Watch Legislative Action Days. One of the most important ways that you can support the SOA 14 is to join them in DC! Meet with your Member of Congress, tell them about these peacemakers headed to prison and ask them to support legislation to close the SOA/ WHINSEC.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To read more about this year's defendants and how you can support them, visit <a href="http://www.soaw.org/new/article.php?id=322" target="_new">http://www.soaw.org/new/article.php?id=322</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE 14 SOA/ WHINSEC DEFENDANTS:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2 sentenced to six months in prison with fines up to $500<br>2 sentenced to four months in prison with a $500 fine<br>7 sentenced to three months in prison with fines up to $500<br>1 sentenced to one year of probation and a $1,000 fine<br>2 given six-month deferred sentences</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robert Nash Chantal, 52, Americus, GA - 3 months; $500 fine<br>Liz Deligio, 28, Chicago, IL - 3 months in prison; $500 fine Brian DeRouen, 27, Fairfield, CA, student in Dayton, OH - 4 months in prison; $500 fine Meagan Doty, 22, St. Louis, MO, student in Dayton, OH - 3 months in prison, $500 fine Ronald Durham, 24, Chicago, IL - 3 months in prison; $500 fine Alice Gerard, 48, Buffalo, NY - 6 months in prison; $500 fine Tom MacLean, 79, Ashfield, MA - 3 months in federal medical facility Sr. Lil Mattingly, 63, Maryknoll, NY - 6 months in prison Elizabeth Nadeau, 27, Minneapolis, MN - 3 months in prison; $500 fine Mike Ring, 65, Wall, NJ - 1 year of probation; $1,000 fine Dan Schwankl, 31, Siler City, NC - 3 months in prison; $500 fine Aaron Shuman, 32, Oakland, CA - 4 months in prison; $500 fine Two minors - 6 month deferred sentences</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
