<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 6 -- Even after the supposed reforms enacted to remedy the 2000 electoral fiasco, many voters expressed doubts that their votes would be counted in 2004. Though not the total debacle widely expected, in many ways the 2004 election confirmed voters&#146; fears.  A special report in the January issue of the The American Prospect highlights the problems faced by our democracy during the 2004 election. The report was published with the support and contributions of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, JEHT Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and Demos: A Network for Ideas and Action.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contributing authors include scholars, journalists, and public-policy advocates who share an interest and expertise in rebuilding American democracy:<br>	</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America Observed By Robert Pastor, American University,   Why foreign election observers would rate the United States near the bottom. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2004: A Report Card By Tova Andrea Wang, The Century Foundation,  The appearance of a disaster averted obscures an election system that&#146;s still badly broken. <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Democracy We Deserve By Miles S.
