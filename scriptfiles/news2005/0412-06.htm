<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BROOKLYN, NY -- April 12 -- In at least 50 communities across the U.S., demonstrations will be held at Internal Revenue Service offices, Federal buildings, post offices, and other public places on Friday, April 15, to protest the use of tax dollars to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of these events will include people giving their tax dollars to community groups instead of to the IRS.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the actions will be a War Breaks the Budget Tax Day Protest in Tulsa, OK; a Death &amp; Taxes Resistance Festival in Andover, MA; demonstrators will be hanging signs demanding No Money for War from the Burnside Bridge during the morning rush in Portland, OR; while others will be out in the evening until the midnight sharing coffee with last-minute filers at post offices in White Plains, NY, and Manchester, NH, and handing out flyers showing where income tax money goes.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still other protests are making the connections with corporate profiteering from war: You Pay; Lockheed Martin Profit$ is the slogan for protests in Valley Forge, PA; and taxpayers at the main Baltimore City post office will find mailboxes labeled Halliburton, Bechtel, and Lockheed Martin to mail their checks straight to the corporations.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a time when approximately $5 billion per month is going to pay for war and occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan and programs such as housing for low-income families, environmental protection, and even the No Child Left Behind act are cut or underfunded, more taxpayers are questioning the deadly budget priorities of the federal government, according to Joe Maizlish, an organizer with Southern California War Tax Resistance in Los Angeles. A growing number are considering making their protest stronger by refusing to pay some or all of their federal taxes that help pay for war.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration s war in Iraq and the thousands of deaths of soldiers and innocent civilians weigh on the conscience of thousands of U.S. taxpayers some will take to the streets on tax day, while many will refuse to pay their taxes to the IRS. In Berkeley, CA, New York City, and other towns and cities, war tax resisters will publicly redirect their federal tax dollars to community organizations. Redirection is an intricate part of refusing to pay federal taxes to the IRS: resisters instead pay their taxes by giving the money to organizations that meet human needs, care for victims of war, and work for peace and justice.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC) is a coalition of local, regional and national groups founded in 1982 to provide information and support to people who are conscientious objectors to paying taxes for war. Members include the Mennonite Central Committee, Episcopal Peace Fellowship, War Resisters League, Voices in the Wilderness, and the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund, which advocates for legislation enabling conscientious objectors to war to have their federal income taxes directed to a special fund to be used for non-military purposes only.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NWTRCC also promotes protests on tax day and collects a listing of tax day actions (see below):</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Listing of Tax Day Actions &lt;<a href="http://www.nwtrcc.org/taxday2005.htm" target="_new">http://www.nwtrcc.org/taxday2005.htm</a>&gt;<br>http://www.nwtrcc.org/taxday2005.htm</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there is no contact information for an event, call or email the NWTRCC office at 800-269-7464 or <a href="mailto:nwtrcc@nwtrcc.org" target="_new">nwtrcc@nwtrcc.org</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arizona<br>Tucson Women s International League for Peace and Freedom, Local Chapter. <a href="mailto:birnie@gainusa.com" target="_new">birnie@gainusa.com</a>.
