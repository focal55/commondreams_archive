<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 15 -- 35,000 people across the United States are demanding an increase in hybrid vehicle production. Maryland-based nonprofit, the Center for a New American Dream, ran a three month contest&#151;asking members to craft slogans reflecting their desire for better vehicles to save gas, reduce oil dependency, and curb global warming.  Beth Keefauver, of Ashville, NC, will soon drive home the contest&#146;s grand prize, a new 2005 Toyota Prius, for her slogan: Green Cars Today, Blue Skies Tomorrow.  Nearly 10,000 members of the New Dream Community wrote letters to automakers, asking them to increase hybrid production, manufacture hybrids in the U.S., create more hybrid model variety, and shift advertising expenditure to fuel efficient vehicles.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Demand is out there; the excitement around the contest and this issue exceeded our expectations,&#148; Wood continued, &#147;Automakers seem ready to comply with consumers&#146; demands for driving better cars that save them money at the gas pumps while protecting the environment and reducing our dependence on foreign oil.&#148;  said Diane Wood, New American Dream executive director.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demand for hybrid vehicles is outstripping supply; some drivers are waiting up to six months to get their hands on a hybrid.  In response to Americans&#146; growing frustration with the long waits and an eagerness for hybrid choices, the Center for a New American Dream has a new slogan, Green Cars Today, Blue Skies Tomorrow, to bring a louder voice to consumers&#146; desires to do the right thing. The slogan was also chosen as the top Community Choice Awards where nearly 400,000 votes were cast online at www.newdream.org.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Green Cars Today Campaign is an important step in the direction of rethinking the way we use automobiles. As a culture, we can no longer ignore the detrimental social, economic, and environmental impact of American oil consumption. But what is most important is that we each take personal responsibility to take small steps in our own lives to make a difference.&#148; exclaimed Beth Keefauver, one of the creatives behind the winning slogan.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the past 2 years, New American Dream has worked with companies such as Ford, Toyota, and Honda to represent consumer demands for more hybrids manufactured in the U.S. and make more hybrid models. Recently, Toyota has made public announcements that they are increasing production in 2005 and Ford is working on its first sedan hybrid vehicle.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, New American Dream has been integral in assisting state and local government agencies successfully bid for new hybrid vehicle fleet contracts.  King County, WA latest contract will open up hybrid fleet purchasing to other Pacific Northwest jurisdictions.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is actively making a move to purchase an estimated 150 hybrids for use by both state and local agencies.  Demand for hybrids is growing on personal and institutional levels; automakers seem ready to rise to the challenge.
