<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON, MA -- February 28  -- On Tuesday March 1, town meetings across Vermont will discuss resolutions calling for the withdrawal of U.S. military from Iraq and the provision of humanitarian assistance to Iraq. They further call on the Vermont Legislature to set up a commission to study impacts of National Guard deployments on soldiers, families, communities and the state. These resolutions were initiated by a coalition of groups in Vermont that includes Vermont Military Families Speak Out &#150;- a group of families with loved ones in the military, including the Vermont National Guard. The resolutions point to the erroneous claims that were used to take the U.S. into this war. They also point to the substantial costs of the deployment of the Vermont National Guard, including deaths, injuries and trauma for the troops, as well as hardships on families and employers. According to the group Military Families Speak Out, Vermont communities have been placed at risk due to the deployment of essential public safety personnel. Extended deployments in a war that should never have been fought leave Vermont without its full contingent of troops in times of emergency or natural disaster and also threaten the long-term viability of the Vermont National Guard as enlistment and re-enlistment rates decline, the group said.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of Vermont Military Families Speak Out have joined with The American Friends Service Committee -&#150; Vermont Program, the Vermont Network on Iraq Resolutions and others to urge Vermont voters to pass this resolution.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Available for Interview:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) members from Vermont are available for interview.
