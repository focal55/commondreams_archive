<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 14 -- Hundreds of grassroots activists from around the nation will gather in the nation&#146;s capital next week for a three-day seminar and workshop starting Friday, January 21, the day after the Presidential inauguration, and running through the weekend. Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) is sponsoring the event to develop strategies to reshape the future of the Democratic Party. The organization has booked a slate of marquis speakers and presenters representing the full-span of the progressive movement over the last 50 years.  A full schedule of events follows can be found at www.pdamerica.org. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The keynote panel discussion on Saturday, January 22 will feature Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, Medea Benjamin co-founder of CODE PINK and Global Exchange, and James Zogby, founder of the Arab-American Institute. PDA Policy Director Steve Cobble will moderate their discussion on the challenges and opportunities facing the progressive movement. Former California State Senator Tom Hayden will also present &#147;A History of Social Movements&#148; early that same day.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beginning Friday, seminar topics will include how to unify the multitude of interests and ethnicities in the progressive movement, how to communicate to the media and how to build </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">effective grassroots organizations. &#147;The social progress achieved through blood, sweat and tears in the last century is under unprecedented attack,&#148; says PDA Executive Director Tim Carpenter. &#147;The 47% of Americans who disagree with this administration&#146;s policies need to be equipped with the history and tools to protect our civil liberties and advance the cause of social and political progress.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commenting on why PDA the Summit was scheduled to coincide with the second Bush inauguration, Carpenter said, &#147;This inaugural event misses the opportunity to embrace the entire family of Americans, instead it is focused on the narrow clique of those that underwrote the President's re-election. We're sending a signal that American progressives remain a potent, transformative force in U.S. politics.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The Progressive Summit takes place January 21-23 at the David A. Clarke Law School Auditorium at the University of the District of Columbia. The venue is handicapped accessible.
