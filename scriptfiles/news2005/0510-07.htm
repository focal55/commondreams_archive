<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON --May 10 -- The campaign finance watchdog group Public Campaign Action Fund launched The Delay Rankings at a new Web site today that allows constituents see how close their representative is to the scandal-plagued House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Tom Feeney (R) of Orlando tops the list, voting with DeLay 97 percent of the time, and has received $10,000 in campaign contributions from Delay's political action committee. Rep. Dave Weldon (R) of Indialantic isn't far behind. Ranking at No. 4, he's received nearly $14,000 from DeLay and has donated $6,000 to DeLay's legal defense efforts.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DeLay Rankings Web site is user friendly with easily sorted data for members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The rankings are based on six categories, including how much money members have received from DeLay's Americans for a Republican Majority PAC; how much they have given to DeLay's legal defense fund, and how frequently they have voted with DeLay. The Web site is <a href="http://www.InDeLaysPocket.com/" target="_new">http://www.InDeLaysPocket.com</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The DeLay Rankings is a great tool for people across the country who want to know if their representative is in DeLay's pocket, or whether they can act independently,&quot; said David Donnelly, national campaigns director of Public Campaign Action Fund.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feeney also donated $5,000 to DeLay's legal defense fund. True to his ranking, Feeney defended DeLay the St. Petersburg Times last week saying:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He takes very good care of his members, he understands their needs, and then when he needs to get votes for an issue, he's got a lot of good will built up.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maybe it's good will 'bought' up. All five Republican members of the House Ethics Committee, which is slated to begin investigating DeLay, have received donations from ARMPAC. Committee member Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who has also given $15,000 to DeLay's legal defense fund, ranks No. 13 on The DeLay Rankings. He and fellow committee member Lamar Smith (R-Tecas), who ranks No. 26, have both recused themselves from any investigation into DeLay's practices.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feeney and Weldon are not the only Florida representatives who have cozied up to the Texas Republican. Nine of Florida's 25 members of Congress rank in the top 100; all are Republicans.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.
