<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 20  - With tomorrow's deadline for opposing the transfer of Adelphia Cable to both Comcast and Time Warner at the FCC, a number of groups (including CDD) will tell the commission to deny the mega-cable deal.  One area that both the FCC and FTC should investigate--but probably won't--is how the takeover of Adelphia will spur even greater control over the evolution of the TV and broadband applications market.  Competition, programmatic diversity, and advertising will all be affected if the deal is approved.  That's because Comcast and Time Warner will control more subscribers, have expanded &quot;clusters&quot; and &quot;superclusters&quot; of cable systems (controlling huge chunks of adjacent service territories), and have a bottleneck grasp on key markets once the federal government approves the takeover.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interactive television (ITV) is an important and growing medium, covering a range of services including personalized television, video on demand (VOD), and digitally delivered advertising.  The cable industry--led by Comcast and Time Warner--is now embracing ITV services in earnest. [1]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comcast has major new investments and acquisitions in the ITV arena.  It will have additional power to control a range of ITV services, including programming, interactive programming guides (IPGs) advertising rates (local and national), and the set-top box software.   In addition, Comcast's own programming ventures--especially in sports, outdoor programming, and gaming--stand to benefit from their relationship with the suite of interactive applications controlled by the company--placing competitors at an additional disadvantage.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through a variety of subsidiaries and investments, Comcast has positioned itself in this market.   For example, Comcast controls &quot;Double C Technologies&quot; (Cox Communications has a minority investment).  Double C controls a number of interactive TV entities, including &quot;TV Works,&quot; software that provides such advanced services as &quot;Electronic Program Guides, Personal Video Recorders, Video on Demand, Interactive Advertising, Enhanced Programming, Portals and Games.&quot; [2]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year,  Comcast's Double C acquired the North American assets of Liberate, &quot;a leading provider of software for digital cable systems&#138;.  Liberate's software enables cable operators to run multiple services--including high-definition television, video on demand, and personal video recorders&#138;.&quot;  Comcast now controls key &quot;patents and other intellectual property&quot; developed by Liberate, as well as newly developed services designed to deliver &quot;new digital cable products and applications.&quot; [3]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 13, 2005, Comcast acquired another leading interactive television technology provider--Meta TV (which it now has folded into its &quot;TV Works&quot; subsidiary).  The acquisition provides additional clout for Comcast in a wide range of interactive applications, including interactive commerce and advertising.  Meta TV's technologies will also be used as part of the &quot;GuideWorks interactive program guide platform, a joint venture between Comcast and Gemstar-TV Guide International.&quot; [4]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comcast also has financial stakes--as part of its Comcast Interactive portfolio of companies--in the ITV and broadband technology field.  From &quot;Extent Technologies&quot; (involved with Comcast's &quot;Games on Demand&quot; service) to &quot;Visible World&quot; (targeted interactive advertising that &quot;powers Comcast Spotlight AdTag and AdCopy products&quot;), Comcast is in a key position to influence the evolution of both the ITV and broadband services market. [5]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time Warner Ventures also has an investment in Extent.  It too has a leading role in the ITV space, including a financial relationship with Liberty Media's &quot;Open TV.&quot;  It recently (March 28, 2005) signed a &quot;comprehensive agreement&quot; with ITV technology provider &quot;Navic Networks.&quot;  Among the ITV services Time Warner offers, via Navic, are &quot;addressable advertising and enhanced television.&quot; [6]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Comcast notes on its webpage for advertisers, &quot;Comcast is in the unique position of being at the very heart of the next wave of television--how it is experienced by viewers and leveraged by advertisers.  The age of interactive television is here&#138;. [T]he opportunities for advertisers are enormous&#138;.  For the first time ever, advertisers can combine the awareness power of television with the ROI capability of the internet.&quot;  Comcast's &quot;Spotlight&quot; advertising services target both the television and broadband user. [7] </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comcast's role in interactive targeted advertising and research acquisition will be significantly enhanced through its Adelphia acquisition.  Through its &quot;Showcase&quot; services or its relationship with the automotive purchasing firm &quot;Vehix.com,&quot; Comcast will be able to develop, for example, a dominant position in such categories as local automotive advertising sales.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Privacy is another key issue that must be explored in the context of this acquisition.  Beyond programming and advertising markets, Comcast will have greater clout to obtain and use data about consumers.  For example, Comcast already tells potential advertisers that it can provide information about subscribers that can explain &quot;&#138;what makes them tick; their needs, their viewing habits, their intelligence behaviors&#138;.&quot;  Comcast then promises it can provide advertisers with the following research: &quot;Target audience identification/confirmation; Purchase behaviors of your target; Lifestyle Activities of your target; Viewing habits of your target by geographic region; Advertising activity of your competitors.&quot; [8]</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comcast's AdTag and AdCopy efforts, via its investment in &quot;Visible World&quot; and through the use of its technology, permit the company to deliver ads &quot;to designated markets, zip codes, and in the future, households.&quot;  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Undoubtedly, both Comcast and Time Warner will deny that their acquisition of the country's fifth largest cable company will have any negative impact.  If regulators wish to serve the public interest honestly, they will examine how this deal is being driven to help give the first and second largest cable companies--Comcast and Time Warner, respectively--greater control over the future of U.S. television.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
