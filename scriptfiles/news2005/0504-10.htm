<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 4 -- House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement today on President Bush's misleading Social Security plan, which will slash benefits for Americans with disabilities:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush's Social Security plan just doesn't add up for Americans with disabilities. The plan appears to drastically cut the benefits of Americans' with disabilities, even though the President says it won't. Mr. President, which is it: a huge benefit cut for Americans with disabilities or a misleading plan that does nothing to solve the long-term solvency of Social Security?</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans with disabilities and the middle-class have earned their Social Security benefits. The President and Republicans in Congress should not turn these guaranteed benefits into a guaranteed gamble.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans to strengthen Social Security so that all Americans get the guaranteed benefits they have earned. Democrats will not support proposals that gut benefits for disabled Americas and middle-class families and that place retirees at the mercy of the stock market.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
