<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush used the words "peace" or "peaceful" 11 times in brief remarks Monday at the White House. Meanwhile, the AP reported on the same day: "U.S. warplanes and helicopters bombed two villages near the restive city of Ramadi, killing an estimated 70 militants, the military said Monday, though witnesses said at least 39 of the dead were civilians." <br />
<br />
On Friday, Reuters reported that Jean Ziegler, the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food "accused U.S. and British forces in Iraq of breaching international law by depriving civilians of food and water in besieged cities as they try to flush out militants." He "said the Geneva Conventions banned military forces from using 'starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.'"<br />

&middot; 1965 - Vice President Humphrey: "Our commitment to strengthening the peace has not weakened." <br />
&middot; 1966 - President Johnson: "I do not genuinely believe that there's any single person anywhere in the world that wants peace as much as I want it."<br />
&middot; 1967 - Vice President Humphrey: "There is no quick and easy way to peace -- it must and will be built out of the cumulative acts of men and women who dedicate their lives to the service of their fellow men -- and therefore to the service of God."<br />
&middot; 1968 - President Johnson: "But our goal is peace -- and peace at the earliest possible moment."<br />
