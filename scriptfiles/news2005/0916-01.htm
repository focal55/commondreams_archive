<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->NEW YORK  - September 16 -  The United Nations (UN) Summit which ends today in New York looks set to agree no firm action on 
climate change despite broad recognition that it will have devastating 
impacts especially for the world's poorest countries, Friends of the 
Earth International said today.

<p>The Summit, held at UN Headquarters, is the largest gathering of world leaders in history and brings together some 150 heads of state to discuss UN reforms, challenges for the 21st Century, as well as to 
evaluate the progress towards the UN Millennium Development Goals.

<p>The final outcome document of the Summit does not convey the immense 
challenge to stabilise our climate, and the threat that climate change 
poses upon reaching the UN Millenium goals by 2015.

<p>The Summit text being put forward today reveals that no progress has been made on climate change. Circulation of previous drafts demonstrates 
that the outcome document has been significantly weakened through the 
negotiation process.

<p>The final Summit document rightly refers to the role of the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. But it does not go 
far enough in recognising the authority of the November 2005 UN Climate 
Summit in Montreal (Canada) to begin negotiations for the post 2012 
international climate commitments.

<p>Friends of the Earth International's Climate Campaigner Catherine Pearce 
said:
"World leaders have clearly failed to face up to the urgent need to take 
action on climate change.  This Summit was a golden opportunity for the 
UN to commit resources to and support some of the world's poorest 
countries who will face the harshest impacts of the world's changing 
climate.

<p>"The international community must recognise the need to assist poorer countries in dealing with the impacts of climate change. Money must be made available to help countries adapt to the changing climate, and also 
to cope with climate disasters," added David Waskow, international program director at Friends of the Earth US.

<p>The scientific evidence clearly shows that climate change is happening and that greenhouse gas emissions must be curbed.  Unless urgent action 
is taken by the richest, industrialised nations to reduce emissions, the 
poverty reduction envisaged by the Millennium Development Goals will not 
be achieved [1].

<p>The potential and capacity for renewable sources of energy, in terms of their contribution to poverty alleviation and sustainable development in 
developing countries is poorly acknowledged in the final Summit outcomes.

<p>Friends of the Earth International also criticised the final text for failing to recognise that the conservation and sustainable use of the natural environment is a pre-condition for poverty eradication and human 
well-being, as concluded by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.

<p>The recommendations on international environmental governance that were agreed at the 2000 UN Millennium Summit form a clear mandate for the UN General Assembly to discuss the transformation of the UN Environment Program into a specialized agency financed by assessed mandatory contributions from UN member states.
<p>NOTES TO EDITORS:

<p>[1] The Working Group on Climate and Development, which Friends of the Earth is an active member of released their second report, 'Africa - Up In Smoke?' in July 2005 to coincide with the G8 summit. It recommends 
that international efforts to combat poverty in Africa and other parts 
of the developing world can only be effective when combined with urgent 
global action on climate change. The report is available at: http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/africa_up_in_smoke.pdf
<p>The first report, 'Up in Smoke?' released last October 2004 is available 
here: <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/up_in_smoke.pdf%20" target="_new">http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/up_in_smoke.pdf
