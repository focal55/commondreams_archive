<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 4 -- In a letter delivered today and signed by 26 of its member groups, the Sustainable Energy Coalition thanked former President Clinton for his remarks at a recent forum  which explored options for addressing climate change and oil dependency through greater use of energy efficiency and renewable energy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The signers wrote: &quot;We strongly agree with the statements made by you and other forum speakers that noted the link between energy use and both national security and environmental degradation.  We also second your observations about the compelling need to address the worsening problem of global climate change as well as the importance of reducing U.S. reliance on unstable Middle Eastern governments as part of the strategy for fighting international terrorism.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Moreover, we agree that investments in the cross-section of energy efficient technologies and renewable energy offers tremendous opportunity for creating good-paying jobs for American workers as well as new domestic industries.  As you observed, bold investments in sustainable energy technologies can generate economic growth while cutting the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We very much welcome your commitment to use your platform as former President to promote the issues of expanding the use of sustainable energy and reducing consumption of polluting and insecure energy sources such as petroleum and coal.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full text of the letter and the list of signers follows.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Sustainable Energy Coalition is a coalition of business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy organizations founded in 1992 to promote increased use of renewable energy and energy efficiency. </i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUSTAINABLE ENERGY COALITION<br>1612 &quot;K&quot; Street, N.W.; #202-A<br>Washington, D.C. 20006<br>202-293-2898, ext.201</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">January 4, 2005</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President William Clinton<br>The William J. Clinton Foundation<br>55 West 125th St.<br>New York, NY 10027</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear President Clinton:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We, the undersigned member groups of the Sustainable Energy Coalition (SEC), would like to congratulate and thank you for your initiative in convening the December 6 forum at New York University which explored options for addressing climate change and oil dependency through greater use of energy efficiency and renewable energy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We would also like to thank you and your staff for inviting members of the SEC to have booths in the foyer of the conference.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you may know, the SEC is a coalition of nearly 100 national and state-level business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy organizations which collectively represent several thousand companies and community-based groups.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since its founding in 1992, the SEC has worked to promote increased use of energy efficiency and the cross-section of renewable energy technologies, including wind, geothermal, solar, hydroelectric, biomass, corn-based ethanol and other biofuels.  We view these as cost-effective strategies for addressing climate change and other environmental concerns, curbing dependency on oil imports and the attendant risks they pose to national and homeland security, reducing the public health impacts of energy use, and for creating new, high-quality, domestic jobs and businesses.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accordingly, we strongly agree with the statements made by you and other forum speakers that noted the link between energy use and both national security and environmental degradation.  We also second your observations about the compelling need to address the worsening problem of global climate change as well as the importance of reducing U.S. reliance on unstable Middle Eastern governments as part of the strategy for fighting international terrorism.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, we agree that investments in the cross-section of energy efficient technologies and renewable energy offers tremendous opportunity for creating good-paying jobs for American workers as well as new domestic industries.  As you observed, bold investments in sustainable energy technologies can generate economic growth while cutting the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, we concur that constituencies are emerging at the local, state, and national levels that are supporting innovative proposals to promote energy efficiency and cleaner energy production technologies.  As you correctly stated, this can be, and should be, a bipartisan issue in the United States.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lastly, we very much welcome your commitment to use your platform as former President to promote the issues of expanding the use of sustainable energy and reducing consumption of polluting and insecure energy sources such as petroleum and coal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accordingly, we look forward to the opportunity to work with you on this important endeavor in the weeks and months ahead.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alliance for Affordable Energy<br>American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy<br>American Solar Energy Society<br>American Wind Energy Association<br>Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates<br>Breakthrough Technologies Institute<br>Burlington Electric Department<br>Cascade Associates<br>Clean Fuels Foundation<br>Colorado Energy Group<br>Energy Innovations<br>Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute<br>Global Green USA<br>Methanol Institute<br>National Environmental Trust<br>National Hydropower Association<br>New Community Project<br>New Uses Council<br>Potomac Resources, Inc.<br>Solar Energy Industries Association<br>The Stella Group Ltd.<br>SustainableBusiness.com<br>Union of Concerned Scientists<br>U.S. Combined Heat &amp; Power Association<br>U.S. Public Interest Research Group<br>Vermont Energy Investment Corporation</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
