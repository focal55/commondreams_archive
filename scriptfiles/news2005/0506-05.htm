<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 6 -- Now more than ever, political and cultural stress prompts us to ask: What is the relationship between animal advocacy and the non-violent movement to eradicate prejudice?</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How does frustration with the slow pace of change create reactionary views in the midst of a movement that seeks kindness?</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Southern Poverty Law Center knows something about peaceful change - and about the line between the revolutionary and the reactionary. Its Intelligence Report is the nation's pre-eminent periodical monitoring the radical right in the U.S.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lately, the Intelligence Report has pinpointed issues of concern to all North American environmentalists and animal activists.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Report recently ran a critique of what it called the international eco-radical movement, writing: &quot;Radical environmental and animal-rights groups have always drawn the line at targeting humans. Not anymore.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time, the Intelligence Report has included a series on the U.S. immigration controversy in environmental groups. Southern Poverty Law's expos&eacute;s regarding the Sierra Club's controversial elections culminated in direct involvement in the election process to persuade Club members to stop the &quot;greening of hate.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Potok, the Intelligence Report's editor, has recently spoken on National Public Radio, CNN Live, Newsnight and Anderson Cooper 360.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Potok will address these controversial issues of our time at Friends of Animals' forthcoming conference, Foundations of a Movement (9-10 July in Manhattan), including in a Keynote Presentation on Saturday 9 July.
