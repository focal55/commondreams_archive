<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WASHINGTON - September 15 - The Bush administration nominee to head the U.S. Fish &amp; 
Wildlife Service is drawing fire from conservation groups. Today a coalition of 
groups released a letter to Congress charging that Dale Hall, currently the 
USFWS Southwest regional director, gave illegal orders to his staff not to make 
scientific findings protective of wildlife, rewrote scientific conclusions for 
political reasons and issued a questionable policy forbidding biologists from 
considering genetic information about species&#8217; recovery.</P>
<P>&#8220;We are not questioning his education or training, we are questioning his 
integrity,&#8221; stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch, noting a series of actions 
by Hall that undercut the mission of the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. &#8220;Dale Hall 
has developed the reputation of being one of the biggest &#8216;biostitutes&#8217; in the 
country; his moral flexibility is apparently why he was picked for this 
job.&#8221;</P>
<P>On July 18, President Bush nominated Hall to take over the vacant 
directorship of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, the agency responsible for 
administering the Endangered Species Act for land and freshwater species. The 
Senate is expected to consider Hall&#8217;s nomination later this month.</P>
<P>&#8220;Dale Hall&#8217;s actions while regional director pushed southwestern wildlife and 
plants closer to extinction. He disregards science, bullies scientists, and is 
at the command of those industries imperiling the nation&#8217;s wildlife. For that 
shameful legacy, Bush is seeking to promote him,&#8221; stated Dr. Nicole Rosmarino of 
Forest Guardians. &#8220;Hall&#8217;s confirmation as national FWS director would be a 
dangerous mistake that wildlife on the brink simply cannot afford.&#8221;</P>
<P>In their letter, the groups detail how, during his tenure as USFWS southwest 
regional director, Hall&#8212;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Instructed subordinates that the agency would not issue findings of 
  &#8220;jeopardy&#8221; for any species currently protected by the Endangered Species Act, 
  meaning that the agency would object to no development project on the grounds 
  that the project would harm threatened or endangered species; </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Ordered biologists in the Southwest to ignore genetics when making 
  decisions about endangered or threatened species&#8217; recovery; and </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Has yet during his tenure to take a single action that protects wildlife 
  that was not the product of a court order. </LI></UL>
<P>In a survey earlier this year of agency scientists working under Hall &#8211;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Fully two-thirds of scientists working with endangered species said they 
  were &#8220;directed, for non-scientific reasons to refrain from making jeopardy or 
  other findings that are protective of species;&#8221; </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>More than one in four reported being &#8220;directed to inappropriately exclude 
  or alter technical information from a USFWS scientific document,&#8221; the highest 
  percentage compared with the other USFWS regions; and </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Four out of five biologists working under Hall did not &#8220;trust USFWS 
  decision makers to make decisions that will protect species and habitats.&#8221; 
  </LI></UL>
<P>&#8220;Unfortunately, Hall fits very well into the administration's strategy of 
attacking science and refusing to implement protections for America's endangered 
plants and animals,&#8221; stated Brian Nowicki, a conservation biologist at the 
Center for Biological Diversity.&nbsp; &#8220;His appointment&nbsp;would be a disaster 
for the biologists of the Fish and Wildlife Service and for the imperiled 
species they are supposed to be protecting."&nbsp;</P>
<P>The coalition of groups opposing Hall&#8217;s nomination includes Forest Guardians, 
the Center for Biological Diversity and Public Employees for Environmental 
Responsibility (PEER).</P>
