<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SAN FRANCISCO - August 31 - The California Highway Patrol (CHP) has abandoned its policy of arresting drivers in possession of marijuana for medical use, a victory many are calling one of the most significant achievements for patients since the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.

<p>Americans for Safe Access (ASA), an organization that advocates for patients' access to medical marijuana, spent the past year collecting reports from nearly 500 patients and caregivers who have been arrested or had their medical marijuana seized by law enforcement. With this material in hand, ASA brought suit against the CHP. More than a quarter of California’s medical marijuana patients have been arrested or had their medicine seized even in cases where the patient produced a doctor’s recommendation or medical marijuana ID card.

<p>CHP's policy change in response to the suit brings the agency in line with the state's determination that Californians should be protected under state laws, regardless of the Raich Supreme Court decision earlier this year.

<p>ASA still has a long road ahead, working to establish legal recourse for patients in case the CHP fails to adhere to its new policy. ASA is also working to pressure local police departments and county sheriffs to bring their policies into line with that of the CHP.
