<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHARLOTTETOWN, CANADA -- April 21 -- As the Canadian commercial seal hunt draws to an end, IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare - www.ifaw.org), today estimated a quarter of a million (250,000) harp seal pups have been cruelly slaughtered in only 10 days of hunting.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government sanctioned commercial hunt for seal pups opened in the Gulf of St Lawrence on 29 March 2005 and closed on 2 April 2005 resulting in the deaths of approximately 100,000 seal pups. On 15 April the hunt then moved on to the &quot;Front&quot; off the coast of Newfoundland where it continues with an estimated 150,000 harp seals already slaughtered.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Canada's annual commercial seal hunt is the largest marine mammal hunt in the world. The quota for this year's hunt is 319,500 seals, set as part of a three-year government &quot;management&quot; plan to kill almost one million (975,000) seals. Seals are killed and skinned for their pelts, which are then sold to fur distributors and the fashion industry.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many people mistakenly think Canada stopped hunting baby seals decades ago,&quot; said Fred O'Regan, IFAW's president and CEO. &quot;But the size of Canada's modern, commercial hunt is as big now as it has been in 50 years. It's time the Canadian government ended this cruel and unsustainable cull - there should be no further quota.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international community is appalled by the cruelty of Canada's hunt for baby seals. In opposition, parliamentarians from Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands are working to create legislation to ban seal products and the U.S. and the European Council are creating resolutions condemning the hunt. In the U.S., seals and other marine mammals have been protected from hunting since 1972 under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the campaign to end the Canadian commercial seal hunt, IFAW has brought media and government officials from around the world to view the hunt firsthand. This year, European parliamentarians and media from Canada and around the globe have observed the hunt with IFAW's help. IFAW hunt monitors work to strict rules laid down by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), but while observing the hunt this year, IFAW monitors were physically attacked and verbally threatened by some sealers on the ice. IFAW condemns the use of violence against its staff and also condemns the use of violence to further animal welfare campaigns.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>About IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare):</b></i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW was founded in 1969 to end the Canadian baby seal hunt. Over the next two decades, IFAW won many hard fought victories for seals, including the 1983 European Community import ban of whitecoat and blueback sealskins. These aggregate victories almost stopped the baby seal hunt in the 1980s. In 1996 Canadian government subsidies propelled the seal hunt to levels unseen in decades and today it is bigger than ever.
