<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 16 -- Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), a leader in the House of Representatives against the war in Iraq, issued the following statement today on the $82 billion Supplemental Appropriations Bill: </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Before we issue another $82 billion for operations in Iraq, to continue a failed policy in Iraq, we must address the greater picture: The Administration has been morally corrupt in its handling of every aspect of the Iraq war, from the very beginning to the present.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Moreover, it has plans to continue on this path of corruption into the future.  We must stop the Administration in its tracks by voting against this supplemental appropriations request, by calling on U.N. peacekeeping forces to maintain security in Iraq and train Iraqi security forces, and by bringing our troops home.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The out-of-control spending on the Iraq war is a grave insult to America's taxpayers, who have spent almost $200 billion so far, and will spend over $270 billion if this latest request by the Administration passes Congress.  $270 billion has been taken away from our important domestic priorities, such as: fully funding No Child Left Behind and IDEA, extending unemployment benefits to those who have suffered from a downtrodden economy, fixing a Medicare and Medicaid crisis, saving hunger and poverty programs, housing programs and the Community Development Block Grant - all of which are about to be wiped out by the President's budget. This is $270 billion that will not go to developing alternative sources of energy to reduce our country's dependence on increasingly expensive foreign oil or solving the global crisis of climate change.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Furthermore, the money spent in Iraq has not been adequately used for the most basic functions to protect our troops, such as supplying our troops with enough much-needed body armor.  Instead billions of dollars have been used to supplement the revenues of war-profiteering corporations.  These corporations have used their ties to the U.S. government to win no-bid contracts and have then overcharged the U.S. government - and the American taxpayer - for their services.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In this whole racket of recklessly spending billions of dollars - U.S. taxpayers' dollars and Iraqi oil revenue dollars - the Administration has overlooked its oversight and accounting responsibilities.  Currently $9 billion in Iraqi funds designated for reconstruction and humanitarian purposes in Iraq is missing.  The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) managed these funds when they disappeared.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Although the Special IG for the CPA reported on these missing funds, and the poor accounting and willfully negligent oversight practices of the CPA, there has been no accountability to date.  No official Congressional Committee yet held a hearing.  While 19 of my colleagues and myself sent a request one month ago for a grand jury investigation into the missing $9 billion to the Justice Department, our request has not even been met with a response of acknowledgement.  And the Administration has the gall to ask for more money to mismanage.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When will be put a stop to this?  Now is the time that we must stand up and reject these policies, starting with a &quot;no&quot; vote on this supplemental.  The U.S. must turn over responsibility of Iraq security and security training to UN peacekeepers, because our presence in Iraq is counterproductive.  We must begin a phased and orderly withdrawal of U.S. troops.  The U.N. must assume responsibility over reconstruction and reparations.  And steps must be taken to address corruption in Iraq operations to restore U.S. moral authority for the United States and the world.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
