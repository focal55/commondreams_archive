<p>WASHINGTON - December 7 - Today Dr. William F. Schultz, Amnesty International USA Executive Director, released the following statement regarding the comprehensive Anti-Torture Amendment that is included in both the Defense Appropriations bill and the Defense Authorization bill, both of which are now in the House:

<p>"It is absolutely unacceptable that Members of Congress are attempting to weaken the Anti-Torture Amendment, which would put the U.S. government in a position of authorizing inhumane treatment.  This would violate U.S. and international law as well as core principles that Americans embrace."

<p>"Whether it is the effort to strip the anti-torture language from the Appropriations bill or allow identical language to wither and never be signed into law on the Authorization bill, all revisions to the original Anti-Torture Amendment must be overwhelmingly opposed."

<p>"Torture is a tool of terror, not liberty.  No country can hope to promote freedom, democracy and justice if it also claims a right to inflict inhuman cruelty.  America's best values will only survive if we stand by them in fearful and uncertain times.  We must never let terrorists influence standards for moral and lawful behavior."

<p>"In addition to passing the original Anti-Torture Amendment language, Congress must to create an independent commission to investigate all aspects of U.S. detention and interrogation practices."
