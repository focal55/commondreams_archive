<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 8 -- When the President speaks on his energy policy tomorrow in Columbus, he is likely to continue pushing for more needless and destructive drilling in special places like the Arctic National Wildlife, instead of increasing America's investment in existing technology to make hybrid and other clean cars, and to generate more wind and solar power.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress and the current administration should take the opportunity to develop a clean energy policy based on renewable energy and greater energy efficiency. Adopting aggressive new programs has the potential to create 1.4 million new jobs and save American families an average of $1275 per year on energy bills by 2025.  They can raise fuel economy standards for new cars, SUVs and other trucks to an average of 40 miles per gallon over the next decade. A 40 mpg standard would save more oil than America gets from the Persian Gulf, and more than we would get from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Persian Gulf combined.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next week, Congress could vote on whether to include Arctic drilling revenues as part of the Federal Budget. But the issue of oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge is too important to the American public and future generations to be snuck through in the budget bill in an attempt to circumvent the established process. It should be fully debated and brought to a vote on its own merits.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would ruin one of America's last unspoiled wild places for what government experts at U.S. Geological Survey say is only a few months' worth of oil that even oil companies concede would not be available for a decade.  Drilling there would not put a dent in our dependence on foreign oil, would do nothing to strengthen our national security, and would not save consumers a dime at the pump. But the harm to wildlife and this spectacular wilderness would be permanent and irreparable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even the oil companies are increasingly skeptical about the amount of oil in the Arctic Refuge. According to a recent article in the New York Times, &quot;A Bush adviser says the major oil companies have a dimmer view of the refuge's prospects than the administration does.  'If the government gave them the leases for free they wouldn't take them,' said the adviser, who would speak only anonymously because of his position. 'No oil company really cares about ANWR.'&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans deserve a cheaper, quicker, safer and cleaner energy policy that safeguards the wild places we care so deeply about. We cannot drill our way to energy independence, but we can embrace responsible measures and real, 21st Century energy solutions that make cars go farther on a gallon of gas, promote conservation, invest in clean renewable energy, and protect our natural heritage.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can break through the gridlock and jumpstart our use of existing technology like hybrid cars, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. By doing so, we can create millions of jobs, protect our wild places, and make America safer and more secure.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
