Potorti recently returned from Spain, where he and other Peaceful Tomorrows members met with relatives of victims of the 3/11 Madrid bombings. As the war began two years ago, Peaceful Tomorrows issued a statement which read: &quot;As family members of September 11 victims, we know what it feels like to experience 'shock and awe,' and we do not want other innocent families to suffer the trauma and grief that we have endured.&quot;<br><a href="http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/" target="_new">More Information</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="mailto:sideshowjeff@hotmail.comsideshowjeff@hotmail.com" target="_new">KAREN MEREDITH, CINDY SHEEHAN, BILL MITCHELL, FERNANDO SUAREZ DEL SOLAR, JOYCE LUCEY, [via Jeff Grubler]</a><br>As members of the U.S. military, their sons -- Kenneth Ballard, Casey Austin Sheehan, Mike Mitchell and Jesus Alberto Suarez del Solar Navarro -- were killed in Iraq.

His three-year term of service was due to expire last August -- but just two months before that, he was informed his term had been extended under the military's &quot;stop-loss&quot; policy and he was to be deployed to Iraq in November. Carl Webb refused to report for duty and has been AWOL since then. He will be speaking at protests this weekend in New York City. He said today: &quot;I believe it's an unjust war on our part. I do not believe what the government has told us the war is intended for. I do not believe this government intends to spread democracy in the Middle East. It's not in the interest of their [Iraqis'] security or our security. I believe it is all about oil and profits and strategic control of the Middle East.&quot;<br><a href="http://carlwebb.net/" target="_new">More Information</a></font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
