<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - Without a doubt, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and rest of the crew in the White House would love to leave last week in the past. For sure, when the president's nominee for the highest court of the land has to withdraw, that doesn't look good for the White House. But much more happened last week. 

<p>The 2,000th U.S. military serviceperson died in Iraq - and the whole country took notice, with a strong majority now agreeing with the peace movement that this war should never have happened and the troops should be brought home. Public outcry over the war continues to grow, and well over 1,000 antiwar activities in every corner of the country marked this tragic milestone. 

<p>And in an encouraging sign that this Administration's many misdeeds may finally be catching up with them, "Scooter" Libby was indicted and forced to resign his post as Dick Cheney's chief of staff. This was not your run-of-the-mill Washington scandal. He was indicted for lying to the FBI, lying to the grand jury, and obstructing the investigation of the lies that were used to justify going to war. The stakes are tremendous. Will this administration get away with covering up the lies they told to take our country into this outrageous war? (Click here for a chronology of events.)

<p>Our task is to now push even harder, to take full advantage of this extraordinary political opening. 

<p>We urge you to use this moment to do two critically important things:


<p>
<ol>
<li>Now is the time to make our voices heard in the media. Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper. Call into the radio talk shows in your town. Organize other people to do the same. The whole country has been talking about the Libby indictment -- we need to make sure they're also talking about the root issue, the lies that the Bush administration used to lead us into war. Now is the time to push hard on our call for an immediate end to the war and bringing our troops home!<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Urge your Congressional Representatives and Senators to speak out. Congress must hear from us, they need to know we want them to challenge the Bush administration and to work for an end to the war in Iraq. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) is preparing to <a href="http://www.demaction.org/dia/organizations/ufpj/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=1421">introduce legislation that will cut off funding for the war in Iraq</a>. This is an important development, one that needs our support. Now is the time to pressure your representative to sign on to this legislation. And now is the time to pressure your elected officials to speak out against the war.</li>
</ol>
<p>The political tide is turning against the Bush administration's reckless and destructive policies -- take this opportunity to speak up for a dramatic change in direction.


<p>We have no illusions that the Senate will have the courage to stop funding the war this week, but it's vital that they face escalating pressure until they stop supporting the war.
