Cindy Sheehan, the grieving military mother whose vigil outside President Bush&#8217;s ranch in Crawford, Texas focused the nation&#8217;s attention on the human cost of the Iraq war, has been traveling throughout the country, visiting the offices of members of Congress and asking them to commit to bringing the troops home from Iraq. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
She has also joined the national volunteer effort to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina. On Tuesday, Sept. 13, she was in Covington, Louisiana, where witnessed first hand the devastation in New Orleans as she helped deliver food and water to one of the poorest and hardest hit neighborhoods. Immediately after Sheehan&#8217;s vigil at &#8220;Camp Casey&#8221; in Crawford ended on August 31, veterans who&#8217;d participated in the vigil drove all leftover supplies from the campsite &#8211; toilet paper, medicines, water, and food &#8211; to Covington, Louisiana, for distribution to Hurricane victims. Since September 2, they have been in Covington, operating a relief operation out of &#8220;Camp Casey III.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;My efforts for these last weeks since we left Camp Casey in Crawford have been about standing up against the disastrous policies of the Bush Administration and about helping people who are suffering because of those policies,&#8220; Sheehan said. &#8220;That includes the US troops who are risking their lives every day in Iraq, and now it also includes the good citizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. In so many ways, the devastation of the hurricane and the disgraceful federal emergency response are intimately linked with Iraq &#8211; the money that went to Iraq instead of to repair the levee; the national guard troops from Louisiana and Mississippi who are in Iraq instead of helping here at home; the botched relief operation that led to so many deaths. We need to hold the Bush administration accountable for both of these failures.&#8221;<br>
<br>
