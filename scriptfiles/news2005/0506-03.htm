<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 6 --</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Gang Deterrence and Community Protection Act (S. 155/H.R. 1279) is expected to come to the House floor in the next couple weeks. Civil rights groups and children's advocates are fighting the bill because it calls for more children being prosecuted as adults in the federal criminal justice system, the expansion of the death penalty, and the imposition of mandatory minimums for gang related crimes.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moving Ideas just issued a report, &quot;Gangs Bill: Prosecuting Children as Adults&quot; (<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/gangs.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/gangs.htm</a>), which lays out in clear, concise language the problems with the bill and includes links to in-depth reports and analysis from policy experts. The report also includes ways for activists to get involved and take action.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It makes no sense to me that this bill calls for more children being prosecuted as adults when the research shows us that the result is a higher incidence of crime and violence, not less,&quot; Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers says.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides it being unfair to hold a child to adult standards, the Gangs Bill runs counter to research demonstrating that the juvenile justice systems in the states are uniquely equipped to deal with the special needs of teen offenders. Juvenile justice systems can provide teens with programs such as treatment, therapy, and family support programs that have been proven to reduce recidivism significantly. On the other hand, teens prosecuted as adults, rather than as juveniles, are more likely to commit crimes after release and more likely to commit crimes that are violent. Furthermore, teens held in adult facilities face more violence by other inmates and prison guards.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Gangs Bill also expands the types of crimes that carry the death penalty sentence and imposes mandatory minimum sentencing. The bill takes control away from impartial judges and gives prosecutors the discretion about whether to prosecute teens as adults, and whether or not to plea bargain. Studies have shown that this type of discretion results in disparate sentencing outcomes based largely on race and quality of defense attorney.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Gangs Bill: Prosecuting Children as Adults&quot; is available at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/gangs.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/gangs.htm</a>. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located in Moving Ideas' Progressive Policy Experts Database at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the leading source for easily searched and sorted progressive policy information, Moving Ideas provides the background information for citizen activism via the Internet.
