<p>HOUSTON - October 13 - The Vote Against the Amendment Campaign, a project of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, today announced the release of seven broadcast commercials in opposition to Proposition 2, a proposed amendment to the Texas constitution that would prohibit any legal recognition of same-sex relationships. The measure will be on the ballot on November 8.

<p>The seven television spots, which begin airing today, feature several Houston gay and lesbian families talking about their love and the need for, and importance of, marriage equality. While there have been many television ads opposing state anti-marriage constitutional amendments over the last few years, this new series is the first time same-sex couples have spoken directly about why marriage matters. 

<p>"These groundbreaking ads will introduce Houston voters to their gay and lesbian neighbors and underscore that this constitutional amendment will hurt real people and real families," said National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Director of Organizing & Training Dave Fleischer. "We think it is important to speak to voters openly and honestly about our lives and relationships. When voters know who we are, many more of them see the need for marriage equality for gay families and consider standing with us on the issue."

<p>"It is imperative that Houstonians understand the negative impact this amendment will have on our lives and our families," said Rev. Carolyn Mobley and Adrain Bowie, who appear in one of the commercials. "We are not second-class citizens, and we need the same resources and rights available to heterosexual couples to protect our families."

<p>According to the U.S. Census, there are 9,784 same-sex couples in the Houston metropolitan area, with a total of 42,912 same-sex couples in the state of Texas. The greater Houston metro area ranks 44th out of the 331 metropolitan areas defined by the Census nationwide. 

<p>The Vote Against the Amendment Campaign and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force are working in partnership with the coalition of state and local groups in Texas that are part of the No Nonsense in November campaign. 

<p>"Our opponents have vastly greater resources at their disposal and are relying on myths and fear-mongering to hurt Texas families. We appreciate the work of the Task Force to show the truth about who we are," said Glen Maxey, the No Nonsense in November campaign manager. 

<p>Proposition 2, which will be decided on November 8, prohibits marriage, civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex families. The Task Force has committed significant resources to helping the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community educate voters about the detrimental impact of these divisive amendments. This commitment includes training, voter identification, organizing key communities, as well as significant financial assistance. 

<p>To date, 18 states have amended their state constitutions to preclude the recognition of same-sex marriage, with most of the amendments also forbidding any legal recognition of same-sex families.
