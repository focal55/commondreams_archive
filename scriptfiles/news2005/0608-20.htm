<p>WASHINGTON - June 7 - </p>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Statement by Carl Pope, Executive Director, Sierra Club:</font></i></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair both talked about the seriousness of global warming today, sadly in practice President Bush consistently dismisses the growing scientific consensus from his own federal agencies that global warming is an immediate and real threat.  Why does the President pay lip service to global warming whenever foreign leaders are in the room, but then turn around and push policies that would increase America's global warming pollution?</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Just last week, President Bush called on Congress to pass his energy bill, that would only increase America's emissions of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming.  Instead of taking America forward, the energy bill would funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to the oil and other fossil fuel industries.  This is just another example of President Bush saying one thing and doing another.  It is time for President Bush to start listening to his top scientists and stop blocking action on global warming just to protect outdated, polluting energy industries.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;America deserves a responsible energy policy that uses innovative 21st century technology to curb global warming.  By investing in real energy solutions - like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and fuel-efficient vehicles like hybrid cars - we can create new jobs, lower consumer energy bills, cut America's dangerous dependence on oil, and curb global warming pollution.&quot;</font></p>
