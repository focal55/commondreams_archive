<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C. - Africa Action today recognized 
the success of grassroots movements in bringing the Group of 8 (G-8) to 
a deal on the path toward debt cancellation. This weekend's announcement 
of a deal on debt cancellation for 18 impoverished countries, 14 of 
which are in Africa, marks a small victory, but Africa Action emphasized 
that dozens of other African countries continue to be trapped under a 
burden of illegitimate debt, which the G-8 wealthy nations' plan still 
fails to address. Africa Action also rejected the G-8's embrace of the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative as the framework for 
debt cancellation, noting the harmful economic conditions tied to this 
widely-discredited program.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Salih Booker, Executive Director of Africa Action, said this 
morning,"This weekend's announcement marks a victory on the path to debt 
cancellation, but will make no difference to the majority of African 
countries, and other countries in the Global South, who are excluded 
from this deal and who will be required to continue servicing 
illegitimate debts at the expense of their own urgent needs. The 
continued theft of these countries' resources in the form of future debt 
service payments is completely immoral and this is made all the more 
apparent by this debt cancellation for the few."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ann-Louise Colgan, Director of Policy Analysis and Communications at 
Africa Action, noted today, "We reject the G-8's affirmation of the 
harmful HIPC framework as the basis for future debt cancellation, when 
it is clear that the devastating conditions required by this program 
have deepened the debt crisis and exacerbated poverty across the African 
continent. The continued exclusion of countries like Nigeria and South 
Africa, who also carry massive burdens of illegitimate debt, is 
unacceptable as a matter of law and justice."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marie Clarke Brill, Director of Public Education & Mobilization at 
Africa Action, said, "The sustained and strategic advocacy of people 
across this nation and the world was crucial to the accomplishment of 
this debt deal. In the lead up to the G-8, and beyond, this grassroots 
movement will celebrate initial victory and continue the work to 
dismantle HIPC conditionality and expand cancellation for all African 
nations."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Salih Booker added, "Let us be clear that this weekend's success comes 
not as a result of rich country largesse, but is the fruit of years of 
campaigning on the part of African civil society and governments and 
global supporters in the debt cancellation movement. This progress is a 
start, but the campaign will continue until all African countries are 
freed from the burden of illegitimate and unpayable debt."
