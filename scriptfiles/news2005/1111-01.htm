<P>LISBON - November 11 - Greenpeace commended the efforts of 1998 
Nobel Prize in Literature winner, José Saramago, and several of his 
publishing houses today for joining the Greenpeace Book Campaign and 
printing the Spanish, Brazilian, Portuguese, Italian, French and Catalan 
editions of his new novel on paper not sourced from ancient forest 
destruction. (1) 

<P>Speaking from the launch of the Spanish and Portuguese editions of The 
Intermittencies of Death, in Lisbon this evening, the highly acclaimed 
author said: "I have asked all my publishing houses around the world to 
launch Forest Stewardship Certified editions of my new book in support 
of Greenpeace campaign to save ancient forests...I think that if all 
authors around the world also decide to support this campaign, it be 
will a revolution in the way books are made today."

<P>The Greenpeace Book Campaign is calling on the publishing industry to 
use 'ancient forest friendly' paper. This is paper that uses as much 
post consumer, recycled fibre as possible. If it does contain virgin 
fibre, it must come from Forest Stewardship Council certified sources 
(2).  Saramago's publishers have not printed all his new novels on paper 
of this high standard, but they have taken a positive first step by 
using more ecologically sound paper. (3)

<P>Greenpeace International Programme Director, Bruno Rebelle, said: 
"Initiatives like this prove that our natural and cultural heritage can 
stand hand in hand. Only 20 per cent of the world's original forests are 
left and unless we stop cutting them down to make products like books, 
they will be gone in decades. Greenpeace thanks Saramago and his 
publishers and hopes they will continue to help save the last ancient 
forests by printing all their books on 'ancient forest friendly' paper 
in the future. "

<P>Life on Earth depends on ancient forests. They regulate our weather, 
filter air, clean our water and stabilize our climate. They are also 
home to two thirds of the animals and plants that live on land as well 
as thousands of cultures and peoples who depend on the forest for their 
survival.

<P>Over 70 other publishing houses in Canada and Europe have already joined 
the Greenpeace Book Campaign and pledged to stop using paper that 
contains fibre from ancient forests for all their books, including 
Random House U.K., Canada and Germany. With the support of authors like 
Saramago, J.K. Rowling (U.K.), Isabel Allende (Chile/US), Margaret 
Atwood (Canada) and Günter Grass (Germany), over six and half million 
books have been printed on 'ancient forest friendly' paper to date.

<P>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization, which uses 
non-violent, creative communication tools to put the spotlight on global 
environmental problems, and to drive towards solutions essential for a 
green and peaceful future.

<P>Notes to editors:

<P>(1)  The Italian (Einaudi), edition will be printed on recycled paper; 
the Brazilian (Cia. das Letras) and French (Le Seuil) editions on FSC 
certified paper; the  Spanish (Alfaguara), Portuguese (Caminho) and 
Catalan (Ediciones 62) on paper not sourced from ancient forests.  

<P>To become totally 'ancient forest friendly' Saramago's publishers need 
to use more recycled paper for all their book titles.

<P>(2) FSC is the only certification scheme that guarantees the timber 
products and fibre you buy come from forests that have been managed in 
an environmentally and socially responsible way. Post-consumer fibre has 
gone through its intended use (been purchased by a consumer) and then 
recovered through a recycling program.
