<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 25 -- Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), a leader in the House of Representatives against the war in Iraq, released the following statement in response to news reports that the Administration will request an additional $80 billion dollars for the war in Iraq:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress should reject the Administration's request for an additional $80 billion in funds for the war in Iraq. The Administration's entire case for the war has now been debunked, Iraq is on the verge of a civil war, and the Administration still refuses to admit any mistakes. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;American troops and American taxpayers are footing the bill for a war that was never needed, and a war that is counterproductive to the security interests of our nation. No weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq and the 9-11 Commission has determined that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the September 11th attacks or the Al Qaeda terrorist network.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The war in Iraq and the subsequent occupation has been a failure. Iraq is on the verge of a civil war, and the attacks on US soldiers and innocent Iraqi citizens by insurgents are becoming more brazen and deadly by the day.  Iraq has now become a breeding ground for terrorism.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Administration has no exit strategy.  Iraqi elections, while an important step, will not bring an end to the US occupation of Iraq, and will not bring our soldiers home.<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Congress will fail at its most basic of duties if it serves as nothing more than a rubber stamp of this Administration's polices.<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress should reject this Supplemental request, along with the Administration's failed policy in Iraq, and work to bring our soldiers home.&quot; <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
