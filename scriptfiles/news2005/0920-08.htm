<p>WHAT: Military families, Gold Star families and veterans
will attempt to deliver to President Bush a copy of the
four questions they want to ask him about what is the
“noble cause” their family members are fighting and dying
for

<p>On September 21, Cindy Sheehan and the
Bring Them Home Now Bus Tour will arrive in Washington, DC
to bring their call for an end to the Iraq war directly to
the doorstep of members of Congress.

<p>The 51-city, 28-stop tour has been traveling the country
for the last month to
highlight the voices of Gold Star families, who show the
devastating human cost of the war in Iraq; the voices of
military families, for whom each and every day of this war
brings the potential for the most devastating of
consequences; and the voices of veterans, who can share
the ground truth about war and the impact on those who
were sent off to fight it.

<p>Their message: "Bring the troops home now, take care of
them when they return, and to never again send our loved
ones to war based on lies."
 
<p>In recent events, Sheehan and the other tour members have
been calling attention to the relationship between
Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq war.

<p>Sheehan has also joined the national volunteer effort to
aid victims of Hurricane Katrina. Last week, she was in
Covington, Louisiana, where she witnessed first hand the
devastation in New Orleans as she helped deliver food and
water to one of the poorest and hardest hit neighborhoods.
Veterans who’d participated in her vigil in Crawford,
Texas have been in Covington since September 2, operating
a relief operation out of “Camp Casey III.”
 
<p>“My efforts for these last weeks since we left Camp Casey
in Crawford have been about standing up against the
disastrous policies of the Bush Administration and about
helping people who are suffering because of those
policies,“ Sheehan said.

<p>“That includes the US troops who are risking their lives
every day in Iraq, and now it also
includes the good citizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Alabama. We need to take the money that’s being spent on
war and destruction in Iraq and put it toward hurricane
relief and reconstruction in New Orleans.”

<p>According to Monday's CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll these
sentiments are shared by a majority of Americans. 54 % said
they would cut spending for the war in Iraq to pay for
hurricane relief, and 59 % said launching the war was a
mistake. That figure is the highest recorded in a CNN/USA
Today/Gallup poll. Only 39% said the invasion of Iraq was
the right thing to have done.
 
<p>In addition to Cindy Sheehan, the following veterans and
families who also lost loved ones in Iraq are
available for interviews, among others:

<p>Al Zappala of Philadelphia, PA, whose son Sgt. Sherwood
Baker was the first Pennsylvania National Guardsman to die
in combat since World War II. Tammara Rosenleaf of Belton,
TX. Her husband is stationed at Ft Hood, TX and will
deploy to Iraq this fall. Elliott Adams of Sharon Springs,
NY enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War. He served
in Vietnam, Korea, Japan, and Alaska as an infantry
paratrooper.
 
<p>These military families and veterans, among others, have
been traveling with the three-bus Bring Them Home Now bus
tour launched from Camp Casey in Crawford, Texas at the
end of August. They will remain in Washington, DC thru
Saturday, September 24, to participate in the large
anti-war march and rally.
