the Icelandic government' s decision to issue quotas to hunt whales for 
the third year running. The government has just granted permission for 
39 minke whales to be killed in the 2005 hunt. The Icelandic go ahead 
comes just 2 weeks after so-called 'scientific whaling' was condemned by 
the International Whaling Commission at its 2005 meeting in Ulsan, Korea.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace International oceans campaigner John Frizell said: "Iceland's 
whaling programme provides no money, no useful science, and could 
seriously damage both the country's tourist industry and its 
international reputation. What's more, domestic public opinion 
increasingly supports whale watching rather than whale killing."

</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like Japan, Iceland has been carrying out whaling under the guise of 
scientific research but the meat and blubber ends up being pushed to the 
commercial market. However, the market for whale meat and blubber in 
Iceland is small and is decreasing. Only a quarter of last year's catch 
was sold.  Iceland' s freezers and storage are full with up to 40 tonnes 
of unsold whale meat and blubber from the 2003 and 2004 hunts.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Icelandic Tourist Association and whale watching operators have made 
it clear that whaling damages the reputation of the nation and has a 
negative impact on tourism. In recent years, tourism has become a major 
source of income in Iceland; whale watching alone attracts around 82,000 
tourists annually and is worth more than $18 million USD a year. (1)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

"Whaling is just one of the threats from humanity facing whales today - 
they're also threatened by pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and 
the effects of climate change. Iceland should stop whaling now, and 
choose the sustainable path that also makes scientific and business 
sense; whale watching," said Frizell.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iceland's 2003/2004 hunts took 61 minke whales in total instead of the 
original quota of 500, which included 200 fin and 100 sei whales. The 
reduced catch was the result of a combination of whalers being refused 
permission to export their catches, strong domestic criticism and a 
markedly reduced market for whale goods in Iceland.
<br>
</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) In 2003, Greenpeace launched a pledge asking people to consider a 
holiday in Iceland if whaling was stopped. Over 67,000 people have taken 
the pledge so far - this represents $78.8million USD in tourism value as 
opposed to $4million from commercial whaling at its peak. The offer, 
presented by Greenpeace to the Icelandic government, clearly shows the 
economic and environmental gain of choosing sustainable tourism over 
whaling. Read more on <a href="http://www.icelandwhalespledge.com%20" target="_new">http://www.icelandwhalespledge.com
