<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 16 - Local mothers, family members of fallen soldiers, and other concerned citizens will hold a vigil in front of the White House in support of Cindy Sheehan, the mother camped out in Texas, demanding that President Bush explain why he sent her son Casey to die in Iraq.

<p>Similar vigils will take place in 1,000 locations across the country on the same day at the same time.

<p>"Many of us have children in Iraq and have the same questions as Cindy," said Christine Yorty, MoveOn member. "We want to know why our sons and daughters are still in Iraq? Why have so many died? When will they come home?" concluded Yorty.

<p>The President is on vacation in Crawford, Texas and refuses to meet with Cindy.

<p>"I want him (President Bush) to tell me why my son died," Cindy Sheehan said. At a brief meeting with the President and the parents of deceased soldiers, Cindy added, "His mouth kept moving but there was nothing in his eyes or anything else about him that showed me he really cared or had any real compassion at all....He wouldn't look at the pictures of Casey... Every time we tried to talk about Casey and how much we missed him, he would change the subject."

<p>Local Vigil Details:

<p><b>WHO</b>: Mothers, military families, and citizens in Washington DC speak out at event sponsored by Democracy for America, True Majority and MoveOn.org

<p><b>WHERE</b>: H St. in front of Lafayette Park, and the White House

<p><b>WHEN</b>: Wednesday, August 17, 2005 at 7:30 p.m.

<p>Personal Statements from vigil organizers:

<p>Karen Bradley, DC: I too have lost a child, although not to war. I understand the sense of loss and of outrage that comes from losing a child-but I don't know how I could have borne knowing that a child of mine died because someone told lies and was ill-prepared to deal with the realities of an invasion and occupation. I'm standing with Cindy Sheehan because finally, finally, someone is saying, "Look, the Emperor has no clothes" -- and saying it so bravely and boldly that already people in more than 1,000 communities are standing with her today to send the White House a message: "Mr. President, we want the TRUTH."

<p>Christine Yorty, DC: I'm a graduate student and mother young children from DC. I'm a brand spanking new political activist. I feel the actions of the leaders in this country threaten our personal rights and freedoms. These are especially important to me, as my grandfather, a political refugee, risked everything to see that his descendants would enjoy these privileges.

<p>Patrick Leland, Baltimore: I am also a graduate student. From the beginning, the President and his administration have continually downplayed the real cost of the war in Iraq; both the financial costs to tax-payers and, more importantly, the loss of life with which military families and their loved ones have to cope. Cindy Sheehan has a message we need to take to heart. And I think Americans in general are listening, even if their President is not. <!-- #EndEditable -->
