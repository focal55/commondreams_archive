<p>WASHINGTON - December 15 - The nonpartisan  National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) today delivered a  Christmas list for America's national parks to Congress and the  administration.</p>
<p>   &quot;This week, Congress kicked off the holiday gift-giving season  by agreeing to strike the damaging provision from the House  reconciliation bill that would have opened Death Valley National  Park, Mojave National Preserve, and other parks to mining  operations and developers. NPCA has a few other gift suggestions  for America's beloved-and threatened-national parks, &quot; said  NPCA's Senior Vice President Ron Tipton.</p>
<p>   -- Don't Shoot Santa's Reindeer. An amendment to the National  Defense Authorization bill would close part of Channel Islands  National Park to the public in order to benefit a private elk  hunting operation that is, by court-ordered settlement, supposed  to end by 2011. The amendment was introduced under the guise of  providing recreational opportunities for the military-which did  not even ask for this opportunity.</p>
<p>   -- Let Sleigh Bells Ring -- Not Engines. You won't be able to  hear sleigh bells ring amongst the whine of motors roaring  through the parks if the Department of the Interior's proposed  rewrite of the national park management policies is not  abandoned. The rewrite potentially weakens protections against  air, water, and noise pollution, and could significantly increase  opportunities for off-road vehicles and other damaging uses in  the parks.</p>
<p>   -- Keep the Grinch Out of the Parks' Piggy Bank. Congress is  considering cutting the budget of the parks and other federal  programs next year. Already short more than $600 million  annually, the National Park Service needs at least an additional  $150 million in fiscal year 2007 to enable the parks to recover  from recent hurricanes; address homeland security requirements  such as protecting U.S. borders and icon parks; provide adequate  visitor services, and protect historic sites, artifacts, and  wildlife.</p>
<p>   -- Smog-Free Skies for Rudolph. Thirty years after Congress  promised to restore clean air to America's national parks,  unsightly haze, caused mainly by pollution from outdated coal- fired power plants, continues to shroud parks nationwide. The  problem will worsen if the administration rolls back the laws  aimed at cleaning up these old power plants. This holiday season- instead of burning even more lumps of dirty coal-the  administration must fully enforce the laws that protect air  quality for the health of our parks and our families.</p>
<p>   -- Bring Some Figgy Pudding -- and the Centennial Act. The  bipartisan National Park Centennial Act (H.R. 1124 and S. 886)  would provide critical new funding for the parks' growing  maintenance and natural and cultural preservation needs in part  from a voluntary check-off on individual tax returns. The support  of Congress and the administration is needed for this innovative  effort to address park needs.</p>
<p>   &quot;Most of our national parks could also use a few stocking  stuffers,&quot; Tipton added. &quot;Petrified Forest National Park in  Arizona, for example, needs funds to complete a congressionally- authorized and locally-supported acquisition of land with  significant archaeological treasures; Gettysburg National  Military Park in Pennsylvania needs more funding to rehabilitate  this Civil War battlefield and its historic cannon carriages, and  Sequoia National Park in California needs a budget increase to  combat the drug cartels that are running illegal marijuana  operations in the park.&quot;</p>
