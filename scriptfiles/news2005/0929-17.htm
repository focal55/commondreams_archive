<p align="left">WASHINGTON - September 29 - Under the guise of modernization, the Army is in the process of shrinking its combat forces and enlarging its headquarters overhead to meet existing manpower ceilings.
<P>At considerable effort and expense, the Army is reorganizing its combat formations.&nbsp; Called “modularization,” the plan is to expand the number of combat brigades from 66 to 77 in the active duty and reserve components.&nbsp; These new “brigade combat teams,” no longer divisions, will constitute the primary level of command to fight 21st century warfare.</P>
<P>It sounds like a reasonable reform – until you scratch the surface.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The expansion of brigades is accompanied by a reduction in the ground combat battalions (the units that actually do the fighting) each brigade will command.&nbsp; These “maneuver battalions” will be reduced to two, in a few cases three, per brigade.&nbsp; This is down from their normal three, sometimes four, maneuver battalions per brigade. Specifically, while the number of brigade headquarters will increase by 11.5 percent (from 66 to 77), the number of maneuver battalions in them will shrink from 201 to 161, or by 20 percent.</P>
<P>The new castrated brigades also have other potential disadvantages. Some plausibly fear they will be able to sustain only limited combat because there will be only two battalions to rotate into reserve or rest, not three or more.&nbsp; Others point out the “reform” will further stress our already overextended forces in Iraq: the pint-sized brigades will require larger manpower deployments to maintain a constant level of combat power.</P>
<P>All this, and quite a bit more that is highly critical of the Army’s “Modularization,” is explained in an analysis performed at the Institute for Defense Analyses for the Army.&nbsp; IDA is a highly respected federally funded research organization that performs work for the Defense Department, and in this case the Army.&nbsp; These unclassified documents have not previously been available to the public.&nbsp; </P>
