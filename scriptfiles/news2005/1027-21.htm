<p>WASHINGTON - In the wake of a devastating hurricane season, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) introduced a Resolution of Inquiry (H. Res. 515) demanding that the White House submit to Congress all documents in their possession relating to the anticipated effects of climate change on the coastal regions of the United States. 

<p>The Kucinich Resolution is co-sponsored by 150 Members of Congress including the House Minority Whip and the Ranking Members of the House Science Committee, Government Reform Committee, Education and the Workforce Committee, Transportation Committee, Judiciary Committee, Rules Committee, Ways and Means Committee, Small Business Committee, House Administration Committee and Homeland Security Committee. 

<p>A Resolution of Inquiry is a rare House procedure used to obtain documents from the Executive Branch. Under House rules, Kucinich's resolution is referred to committee, and action must be taken in committee within 14 legislative days.

<p>The Kucinich Resolution states: 

<p>Resolved, that the President of the United States is requested to provide to the House of Representatives, not later than 14 days after the date of adoption of this resolution, all documents (including minutes and memos) in his possession relating to the effects of climate change on the coastal regions of the United States produced by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Weather Service, the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Assessment Synthesis Team, and the US Geological Survey.

<p>"The American public deserve to know what the President knew about the effects climate change would have, and will continue to have, on our coasts," stated Kucinich. "This Administration, and Congress, can no longer afford to overlook the overwhelming evidence of the devastating effect of global climate change. It is essential for our preparedness that we understand global climate change and take serious and immediate actions to slow its effects."
