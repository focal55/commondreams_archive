<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- March 15 --  On the eve of key votes in the US Congress and United Nations Security Council regarding measures to end the genocide in Sudan, almost 2000 Americans from all 50 states have committed to go without food on Wednesday, March 16th. This rapid, nationwide response answers a call issued by DarfurGenocide.org over the weekend to generate pressure on the US Congress and the UN as they consider support for security measures and humanitarian relief.</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We cannot allow governments to hide behind half-measures and diplomatic gridlock while the Sudanese government's genocide-by- starvation steadily continues. With our small sacrifice, we hope to spark the consciences of our leaders to meet the moral urgency of the moment,&quot; said DarfurGenocide.org Co-Director Ricken Patel.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 300,000 people have already been killed in Darfur since the Government of Sudan launched its plan to &quot;change the demography&quot; of its western province two years ago. The government's &quot;janjaweed&quot; militias continue to massacre civilians, and have already forced over 2 million people to flee their homes for camps where they are vulnerable to attacks, disease and starvation.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hundreds of people continue to respond to the recent &quot;call to fast.&quot; A map is available that displays the location of every participant and a personal testimonial of their reasons for fasting. Each version includes data on 400 of the fasters nationwide and can be accessed through <a href="http://www.darfurgenocide.org/" target="_new">http://www.darfurgenocide.org</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One example of a testimonial from Columbus, Ohio: &quot;I'm striking in solidarity with and to bear witness to what the people of Darfur are enduring, and also to send a message to our governmental leaders that we have a moral imperative to do all we can to stop atrocities like Rwanda and Darfur...so that genocide is never EVER an answer again in the house of our world community.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The &quot;Fast for Justice in Sudan&quot; is organized by <a href="http://www.DarfurGenocide.org/" target="_new">DarfurGenocide.org</a>, a web-based information and action resource devoted to ending the genocide in Darfur.
