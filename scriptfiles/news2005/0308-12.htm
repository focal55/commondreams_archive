<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 8 -- The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence today said a new government report showing that terror suspects are routinely allowed to buy firearms from licensed dealers provides fresh evidence of the need to plug gaps in the nation's gun laws.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, prepared by the General Accounting Office at the request of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, found that over a nine-month period, 47 out of 58 attempted gun purchases by people suspected of ties to terrorist organizations were approved.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report proves beyond any doubt what we have been saying for years,&quot; said Josh Horwitz, CSGV's executive director.  &quot;The gun lobby likes to talk about how many gun laws are already on the books, but what they don't say is that they have succeeded in shooting these laws full of holes, and this has made it harder for law enforcement to keep guns away from terrorists.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suspected terrorists are not automatically prohibited from buying guns.  Federal law bars gun sales only to a narrowly defined set of buyers, such as convicted felons, illegal aliens, and people with a history of mental illness or drug abuse.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Attorney General John Ashcroft adopted a policy stopping the FBI from matching background check records to the names of suspects detained in the wake of the 9-11 attacks.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The policy was later reversed, but the National Rifle Association and its allies in the Bush administration and Congress have imposed major obstacles to the use of gun purchase data in criminal investigations.  For example, Congress has required the FBI to destroy background check records within 24 hours.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're in a tough position,&quot; an FBI official told the New York Times.  &quot;Obviously, we want to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, but we also have to be mindful of privacy and civil rights concerns, and we can't do anything beyond what the law allows us to do.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horwitz said that even if limits on the use of gun purchase records were lifted, prohibited purchasers -- including criminals, terrorists, domestic abusers, and people with a history of substance abuse or mental illness -- can avoid background checks entirely in at least 33 states simply by going to gun shows.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's bad enough that suspected terrorists are allowed to walk into any gun store in America and buy a firearm, but at least there's some chance the FBI will find out about it,&quot; Horwitz said.  &quot;What's even worse is that most states don't even require background checks on sales by unlicensed sellers at gun shows.  Domestic and international terror groups -- not to mention garden-variety criminals -- are well aware of this loophole, and these sales go undetected by law enforcement.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horwitz also noted that the background check system relies on criminal history and mental health records maintained by state governments.  Many states have not entered all of these records in electronic databases, and in some cases they have elected not to make mental health records available for background checks.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Background checks are a powerful tool, and they stop more than 120,000 prohibited purchases every year,&quot; Horwitz said.  &quot;On the other hand, the system can't work if the records aren't available, and law enforcement can't use the system to keep guns away from criminals and terrorists if their hands are tied by politicians.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
