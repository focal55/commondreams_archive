<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 3 --  Moving Ideas just released &quot;Beijing +10: U.S. Record on Women Here &amp; Abroad&quot; (<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/beijing10.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/beijing10.htm</a>), a report detailing the U.S. record on promoting the rights of women here and abroad. Moving Ideas issued this report in conjunction with the 10-year review of the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (BPFA) on Women's Rights taking place in New York City this week.  Also this week, Moving Ideas' new blog, Ideopolis (<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/minblog/" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/minblog/</a>), is featuring CodePink reports directly from the Beijing +10 review and Global Week of Action events.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;U.S. Record on Women Here and Abroad&quot; report details the U.S. record on women in the areas of poverty, health, violence against women, and power and decision-making. The report also includes links to resources from policy experts as well as ways to get involved with the Global Week of Action for Women's Rights Worldwide. &quot;While we've made strides for women's rights, our country's record is far from perfect,&quot; says Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers. &quot;As a world leader, it is important that the U.S. takes the lead in the fight for women's rights worldwide.  Unfortunately, that is presently not the case.&quot;<br> <br>Demonstrating this point, the U.S. representatives to the Beijing +10 review seem unable to focus on anything else other than trying to convince the world that the BPFA didn't establish a right to abortion. That the BPFA does not in fact include language saying countries should work to ensure women have access to the full range of healthcare options.<br> <br>&quot;Beijing +10: U.S. Record on Women Here &amp; Abroad&quot; is available at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/beijing10.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/beijing10.htm</a>. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located in Moving Ideas' Progressive Policy Experts Database at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the leading source for easily searched and sorted progressive policy information, Moving Ideas provides the background information for citizen activism via the Internet.
