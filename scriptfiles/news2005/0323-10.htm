<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 23 -- The West Papua Advocacy Team at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights welcomes twin initiatives by the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus to address continuing and historic abuses of human rights in West Papua and more generally in Indonesia. On 17 March, at the initiative of <br>Congressman Eni Faleomavaga,&quot; members of the Black Caucus 36 members of the Black Caucus signed a joint letter to United Nations Secretary Kofi Annan, seeking a United Nations &quot;review&quot; of the &quot;Act of Free Choice&quot; under which Indonesia annexed West Papua in 1969. The joint letter notes that the &quot;Act&quot; is widely regarded as fraudulent, conducted under duress, and undemocratic. The letter to Secretary General Annan also notes the recent research undertaken by the Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School which concluded that Indonesia had engaged in crimes against humanity in West Papua and that its conduct during four decades of control there may have constituted genocide.  Members of the Black Caucus joined 170 parliamentarians from around the world who have called for such <br>a review by the United Nations.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a separate letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, the Black Caucus strongly criticized the recent decision of the Department of State, on behalf of the Bush Administration, to restore International Military Education and Training (IMET) to the Indonesian military.  Given the Indonesian military's egregious record of human rights abuse in West Papua, East Timor, and throughout Indonesia, as well as its unaccountability for these abuses, provision of this assistance to the Indonesian military is <br>unwarranted.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights (CHR), through its West Papua Advocacy Team, welcomes the growing Congressional concern over ongoing severe human rights abuse in West Papua.  It also notes the growing understanding of the historical context for the current suffering of the people of West Papua. The CHR pledges to continue its efforts to inform the Congress, the Administration and the American people about the realities in West Papua.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
