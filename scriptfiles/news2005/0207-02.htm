A new report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that in 2004, federal tax revenues fell to their lowest level, measured as a share of the economy, since 1959.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush is waging an all out attack on sensible programs that ensure retirement security and make health care affordable for America's working families.  Republicans say they want to privatize Social Security to create an 'ownership society,' when what they're really telling working Americans is, you're on your own,&quot; said Congressman Stark.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This budget will mean poor people get poorer.  But the rich are still getting richer, because $1.8 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy are still part of President Bush's plan,&quot; said Fauntroy.  &quot;African Americans and Latinos have been particularly hard hit by the economic policies of this president.&quot; A new report from United for a Fair Economy shows that since 2000, more than a third of the progress made in the 1990s in reducing poverty among African-American families has been erased, as 300,000 of these families fell below the poverty line from 2000 to 2003.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth member and business leader Arnold Hiatt commented, &quot;Even with the major cuts in basic human services this budget is anticipated to propose, Mr. Bush is leaving our children a crushing legacy of debt.  In effect, the tax cuts for the rich are creating a new birth tax on every baby born in our country.  This soaring deficit continues to undermine the soundness of our economy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Elizabeth A. Letzler presented the group's Responsible Tax Pledge and signed it, along with other affluent Americans.  &quot;We calculate that 257,000 American millionaires are scheduled to receive an average of $123,592 each in federal tax breaks this year, based on data from the Tax Policy Center,&quot; said Letzler.  &quot;That alone totals $32 billion.  Today we're launching a drive to have these millionaires pledge to refuse the tax breaks and donate the proceeds to charity.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth is a national network of over 800 business people, investors and affluent Americans who are concerned about the deepening wealth divide in America and who advocate widespread prosperity.
