<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 3 -- &quot;While President Bush's State of the Union address indicated that he understands Americans want cleaner energy, his speech misrepresented the true thrust of his polluting energy initiatives. President Bush highlighted small parts of his energy plan while glossing over the unpopular centerpiece of his efforts -- drilling for oil in special places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And his ludicrous assertion that nuclear power is &quot;safe and clean&quot; completely ignored the fact that there is still no way to safely transport and store nuclear waste.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush also failed to mention that strong enforcement of the existing Clean Air Act would do more to cut power plant pollution than his proposed legislation, which favors big energy companies. Similarly, while America does need energy policy that provides security while decreasing our oil dependence, the energy plan that Vice President Cheney developed behind closed doors with the energy industry will not get us there.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We can free ourselves from dangerous nuclear power and the polluting industries of the past. We need to invest in modern, 21st century solutions that will produce real increases in efficiency, fuel economy and reliance on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. By investing in modern technology, America could cut its dependence on dirty fossil fuels while saving consumers money, preserving treasured places, and keeping our soldiers safe at home. We don't need to sacrifice Americans' lives, health or lands to meet our nation's energy needs.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
