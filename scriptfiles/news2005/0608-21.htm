<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON   -- June 7 - With the Capitol as a backdrop,  
dozens of "U.N. Diplomats" stood holding oversized headshots/masks of  
John Bolton marked "U.N.diplomatic" and an 11 by 2 foot banner  
exclaiming "Bolton: U.N.diplomatic." in protest of the possible  
imminent Senate confirmation vote for the position of United Nations  
Ambassador.
 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bolton is U.N.diplomatic," said Joe Volk, executive secretary,  
Friends Committee on National Legislation (Quakers).
 
  </font><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Republicans and Democrats agree that Bolton will fail to represent  
Americans at the United Nations," stated Paul Kawika Martin, organizing  
and political director for Peace Action.
 
   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evidence continues to mount that Bolton is "U.N.diplomatic." The  
Senate may vote this week on the confirmation of John Bolton to be U.S.  
Ambassador to the U.N. Bolton's history as a far right-wing political  
bomb thrower and his ideas about the U.N. having ten less floors are  
well known. (see NOTE 1) Also much discussed is Bolton's habit of  
putting his personal politics before those of our government's. (see  
NOTE 2)
 
   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bolton is a loose cannon. He has intimidated and tried to fire a host  
of subordinates, intelligence analysts and even U.N. officials. And  
worse, he stretched the truth to senators telling them that he did not  
abuse subordinates. The Senate should not confirm Bolton," Martin  
concluded.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTES:
 
 </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> John Bolton quotes:
 
 </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1) "There's no such thing as the United Nations. If the U.N. secretary  
building in New York lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of  
difference," Bolton stated at the 1994 Global Structures Convocation,  
New York, N.Y.
 
 </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 2) "We do not support the promotion of international advocacy activity  
by international or non-governmental organizations, particularly when  
those political or policy views advocated are not consistent with the  
views of all member states." -- John Bolton's statement to the UN  
Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All  
its Aspects, 9 July 2001. This stands in stark contrast to the official  
policy of the United States, which is to support and strengthen the  
involvement of non-governmental organizations in international  
processes.</font><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">###</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
