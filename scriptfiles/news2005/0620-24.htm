<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 20 - Nine out the 30 companies that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Index are convicted corporate criminals, according to a report released today by Corporate Crime Reporter.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This should put to rest the myth that indicting or convicting a corporation of a crime results in an automatic death penalty for the corporation,&quot; said Russell Mokhiber, editor of Corporate Crime Reporter.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Wall Street Journal in its lead editorial today, states flat out that &quot;an indictment against a corporation is usually a death sentence, whatever the ultimate legal outcome.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Not true,&quot; said Mokhiber.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In fact, you can be a convicted corporate criminal and still have a robust future - so much so, that you can become or remain a member of that rarified group of 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Index,&quot; Mokhiber said.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Corporate Crime Reporter identified nine Dow Jones Industrial Index corporations  - 3M, Alcoa, Boeing, Exxon, General Electric, General Motors, Merck, Pfizer, and United Technologies - that have been convicted of crimes.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In tallying the corporate criminals, the weekly newsletter did not include crimes committed by joint venture companies or subsidiaries of the 30 corporations.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It looked only at whether or not the parent companies had been convicted of crimes.</font></p>
