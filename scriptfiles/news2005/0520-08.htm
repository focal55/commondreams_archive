<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 20 -- Following FAIR's call for more mainstream coverage of the &quot;smoking gun memo&quot;--the secret British document containing new evidence that the Bush administration manipulated intelligence to justify its plan to invade Iraq--a steady trickle of news reports have appeared. But that coverage has been downplayed in general and is still completely absent from the nightly news.<br> <br>The Los Angeles Times published a page 3 story on the memo on May 12, and the Washington Post ran a page 18 story the following day. More than two weeks after the story broke in the Sunday Times of London (5/1/05), it finally made the front page of a major U.S. newspaper, the Chicago Tribune (5/17/05). <br> <br>After referring to the memo (5/2/05) in a story on the British electoral campaign, the New York Times failed to report on the document's implications about the Bush administration until today (5/20/05); the one-column story didn't mention the manipulation of intelligence until the eighth paragraph. (Times columnist Paul Krugman also discussed the memo on the paper's opinion page on May 16.)  <br> <br>The Washington Post's ombudsman, Michael Getler, who the previous week (5/8/05) had mentioned reader complaints about the Post's lack of memo coverage without evaluating their substance, revisited the issue with a much more critical eye in his most recent column (5/15/05). (The ombud gave back-handed credit to FAIR and the group Media Matters for America--both &quot;self-described media watchdog organizations&quot;--for prompting him to delve into the story.) Getler wrote that Post editors initially told him they didn't pursue the story because they were &quot;tied up with election coverage&quot;--this despite the fact that the leaked memo became a major election story in Britain and likely contributed to Tony Blair's weak returns. When he questioned them again after the email campaign, Getler wrote, &quot;editors agreed that this story should be covered and said they were going to go back and do that&quot;; the Post's May 13 story followed.<br> <br>Getler called investigation of the memo's conclusions &quot;journalistically mandatory&quot; and suggested that the Post story should have been placed on the front page. <br> <br>While the memo has begun to get wider coverage in print, broadcasters have maintained a near silence on the issue. The story has turned up in a few short CNN segments (Crossfire, 5/13/05; Live Sunday, 5/15/05; Wolf Blitzer Reports, 5/16/05), but the only mention of the memo FAIR found on the major broadcast networks came on ABC's Sunday morning show This Week (5/15/05), in which host George Stephanopoulos questioned Sen. John McCain about its contents. When McCain declared that he didn't &quot;agree with it&quot; and defended the Bush administration's decision to go to war, Stephanopoulos didn't question him further. A look at the nightly news reveals not a single story aired about the memo and its implications.<br> <br>When finally questioned by CNN (5/16/05), White House press secretary Scott McClellan claimed he hadn't seen the memo, but that &quot;the reports&quot; about it were &quot;flat-out wrong.&quot; British government officials, however, did not dispute the contents of the memo--which can be read in full online at http://downingstreetmemo.com/ --and a former senior American official called it &quot;an absolutely accurate description of what transpired&quot; (Knight Ridder, 5/6/05).<br> <br>The Chicago Tribune (5/17/05) named several factors that had caused a &quot;less than robust discussion&quot; of the smoking gun memo: Aside from the White House's denials, and the media's slow reaction, the paper asserted that &quot;the public generally seems indifferent to the issue or unwilling to rehash the bitter prewar debate over the reasons for the war.&quot; Of course, it's hard to judge the public's interest in a story the media have largely shielded them from.<br> <br>ACTION:<br>Please contact the nightly news programs and ask them to investigate and report on the new evidence that the Bush administration manipulated intelligence to support its plan to invade Iraq.<br> <br>CONTACT:<br>ABC World News Tonight<br>Phone: 212-456-4040<br><a href="mailto:PeterJennings@abcnews.com" target="_new">mailto:PeterJennings@abcnews.com</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CBS Evening News<br>Phone: 212-975-3691<br><a href="mailto:evening@cbsnews.com" target="_new">mailto:evening@cbsnews.com</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NBC Nightly News<br>Phone: 212-664-4971<br><a href="mailto:nightly@nbc.com" target="_new">mailto:nightly@nbc.com</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer<br>Phone: 703-739-5000<br><a href="mailto:newshour@pbs.org" target="_new">mailto:newshour@pbs.org</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As always, please remember that your comments have more impact if you maintain a polite tone.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
