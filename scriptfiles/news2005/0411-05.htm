<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 11 -- Just in time for Tax Day, the House is poised to pass a permanent repeal of the estate tax, a boon for this nation's millionaires and a loss of much-needed revenue for the federal budget and cash-strapped states. A coalition of groups is urging Congress to reform the tax instead of repealing it completely.<br> <br>Moving Ideas issued a report today, &quot;Reform NOT Repeal the Estate Tax&quot; (<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/estate_tax.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/estate_tax.htm</a>), about the coalition's plan to reform the estate tax and why it is important to keep this source of revenue. The report includes links to resources from the progressive community and ways to take action. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Lawmakers would lead you to believe that estate tax relief is about protecting family farms and businesses or removing a death tax on average Americans,&quot; says Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers. &quot;Don't let them fool you; the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest 2% of Americans. The family businesses they are talking about are companies like Mars Candy, Campbell Soup, and the Seattle Times Company.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estate tax brings in $20 billion for the federal budget annually, and a portion goes to state budgets. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, including the estate tax, will cost $2.1 trillion through 2015 at a time when the budget deficit and federal debt are ballooning out of control. The estate tax also encourages charitable giving, and its repeal would hurt charities' fundraising efforts.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now is not the time to be providing tax relief for the country's millionaires and billionaires,&quot; asserts Alston-Akers. &quot;Especially when Congressional leaders are calling for slashing health care and other essential programs for our nation's poor.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Reform NOT Repeal the Estate Tax&quot; is available at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/estate_tax.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/on_the_hill/estate_tax.htm</a>.<br> <br>Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located in Moving Ideas' Progressive Policy Experts Database at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>As the leading source for easily searched and sorted progressive policy information, Moving Ideas provides the background information for citizen activism via the Internet.
