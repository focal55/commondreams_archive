We stand for all of  those around the world who share our vision of a world in which  diplomacy and generosity replace fear and bombs. This is the only way to  achieve a real, lasting green and peaceful future,&quot; said Yannick Jadot  of Greenpeace France.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Global leaders over the past 20 years have failed to meet the challenge  of creating a lasting peace. The cold war has ended but oil wars have  begun; the threat of nuclear war has been joined by the reality of  global warming. While nearly half the world's population survive on less  than two dollars a day, the global nuclear weapons bill is still rising. (1)</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This week's G8 meeting has failed to deliver what is needed to combat  the causes of conflict,&quot; said Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International.  &quot;The offer of US$50 billion to alleviate poverty is a small but  significant step in the right direction but for all of the seemingly  difficult debate; it represents a small percentage of the money that the  G8 nations spend on military defence. In failing to tackle climate  change, they consign the world to dangerous environmental changes that  can only create more insecurity and conflict. Far greater resources need  to be diverted to removing the causes of conflict rather than adding to  its consequences.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Bombs are never the answer - not on the Rainbow Warrior, not in the  streets of London and Baghdad, and not in the nuclear arsenals of the  US, France, the UK and the other nuclear weapon states,&quot; said Townsley.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;By creating our human symbol of peace today in Paris, and commemorating the bombing of our flagship 20 years ago, Greenpeace hopes that millions  around the world will draw hope and give life to the vision of a green and peaceful  future for us all,&quot; concluded Townsley.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notes to Editors: THIS MEMORIAL WILL BEGIN AT 13.35 AND END AT 14.15 AT PLACE DU TROCADERO (1) For example: since 1945 the US has wasted nearly US$6 trillion on its nuclear weapons programme; this year alone France will spend 3.2 billion  euros on nuclear weapons; and each year the UK spends more than 1.5 billion  pounds on its Trident nuclear weapons system.</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
