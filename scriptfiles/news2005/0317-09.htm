<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 17 --  The most curious thing about the nomination of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank is not so much the nomination, but the response.  Throughout the world there is shock mixed with indignation.  Why, we at TransAfrica Forum ask, should there be any shock?  Did anyone truly believe that following the November 2004 elections that President Bush had turned over a new leaf and was prepared to engage the world in anything less than bullying?  Why are commentators so easily deceived by one or two speeches by the President that suggest bi-partisanship, or willingness to cooperate, when this conflicts so clearly with the course of this administration?</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The nomination of Wolfowitz demonstrates the contempt that the Bush administration holds for the opinion of foreign leaders and their peoples.  Wolfowitz, an admitted major architect and cheerleader for the illegal US war and occupation of Iraq, is precisely what the World Bank does NOT need in a leader.  This is both due to symbolism and substance.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            On substance, the question that must be asked is what precisely does Wolfowitz know about development and the issues facing the planet&#146;s underdevelopment countries?  When has Wolfowitz demonstrated that he is a champion for the downtrodden on this planet?  When has Wolfowitz advanced ideas that recognize the need for nations to follow a self-determined path for economic development?  One can guess the answer.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The symbolism of the act of nominating Wolfowitz is just about as important as the action itself.  An individual who dismissed international concern about the proposed and actualized US invasion of Iraq cannot be taken seriously as a leader who will be able to negotiate in a complicated and often contentious, international diplomatic environment.  In fact, the nomination of Wolfowitz also serves as a poison pill, not so much for an already flawed and anti-people institution&#151;the World Bank&#151;but for any possibility of constructive relations between the US and most of this planet, at least through the length of this Administration.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
