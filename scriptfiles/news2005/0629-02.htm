<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 28 - &quot;This is a truly outrageous decision-the U.S.   Supreme Court just hung a 'shoot here' sign around   the necks of battered women and   their children all across the country,&quot; said NOW   President Kim Gandy.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled in a 7 to 2   decision that police officers are exempt from legal   action, even if their refusal to   enforce a valid restraining order results in death.   The decision in Castle Rock v. Gonzales said Jessica   Gonzales did not have a   constitutional right to police enforcement of the   court order issued against her abusive estranged   husband. Gonzales sued the town   of Castle Rock, Colo., after she repeatedly pleaded   with police to enforce the restraining order against   her husband, who had   kidnapped their three young daughters. The girls   were eventually found dead inside his truck.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Abusers may feel they have a green light to ignore   restraining orders, and police departments under   budget restraints could see   domestic violence enforcement as a 'no penalty' area   to cut resources,&quot; Gandy said.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gonzales sued Castle Rock alleging the officers'   failure to use &quot;every reasonable means&quot; to enforce   her restraining order violated   the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process.   Although a federal judge in Denver dismissed her   lawsuit, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court   of Appeals re-opened the case. They said the   restraining order was a government benefit that   should be enforced as any other   property right. When the Supreme Court agreed to   hear the case, the Bush administration filed on   behalf of Castle Rock, saying that   to uphold the 10th Circuit's findings would   inappropriately insert the federal courts into state   matters.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Writing for the majority yesterday,   arch-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia said   Colorado's law does not entitle people who receive   protective orders to police enforcement. Scalia   wrote that, &quot;Our cases recognize that a benefit is   not a protected entitlement if   government officials may grant or deny it in their   discretion.&quot;      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I've heard that many local officials were nervous   about this case, fearing a flood of lawsuits-and   well they should, because we all   know that battered women are at greater risk of   murder after leaving the relationship,&quot; Gandy said.   &quot;One of the reasons is the 'who   cares' attitude of police officers like those in   Castle Rock when it comes to domestic violence-and   now they have the Supreme   Court's seal of approval.&quot;<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><center>###</center></font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
