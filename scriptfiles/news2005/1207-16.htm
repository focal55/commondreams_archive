<p>WASHINGTON - December 7 - The recipients of this year's Right Livelihood Awards (often referred  
to as the 'Alternative Nobel Prizes') arrived in Stockholm on  
Tuesday. They were speaking at a press conference in the Foreign  
Office Press Room on Wednesday morning 7 December 9:30 CET.

<p>Maude Barlow and Tony Clarke are Canadian activists for fair trade  
and a human right to water. Maude Barlow said: 'The growing fresh  
water crisis is perhaps the most urgent environmental and human  
rights issue of our times and, for this reason, water must be  
preserved as a common heritage.' Tony Clarke added: 'Yet, next week  
in Hong Kong, the World Trade Organisation could decide, in effect,  
that water be controlled by for-profit corporations and sold in the  
open market to the highest bidder.'

<p>The leader of the organisation First People of the Kalahari, Roy  
Sesana, fights for the land rights of the Gana, Gwi and Bakgalagadi  
'Bushmen' against powerful corporate and government interests in  
Botswana. He said: 'My people are currently suffering terribly inside  
the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, which is my ancestral home. As the  
game reserve has been completely sealed off by the government of  
Botswana, families have been split up and people are being prevented  
from hunting and gathering by armed police and are dying of  
starvation and dehydration. Before coming here I was imprisoned for  
trying to take food and water to my family.'

<p>Irene Fernandez from Malaysia fights for the rights of the poorest  
and most vulnerable in Malaysian society - migrant workers, farm  
workers, domestic workers, prostitutes and AIDS sufferers. She said:  
'The thread of globalisation connects peoples all over the world. But  
it is the impact of this globalisation that tends to divide and  
marginalise various communities. I am very happy to be part of the  
Right Livelihood Award Family because it binds us together to  
humanise the world.'

<p>Francisco Toledo, one of Mexico's greatest contemporary artists, did  
not travel to Stockholm, but was represented by his daughter Natalia  
Toledo. She said: 'In our mother tongue, Zapotec, beauty and justice  
have the same meaning - we use the word 'Sicarú' to designate them.  
This means to search for a way of life based on beauty and justice  
for all. This, for us, is the way ahead.'

<p>More information on the recipients can be found at: <a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/news/event05.htm">http://www.rightlivelihood.org/news/event05.htm</a><p>A news package with footage from the press conference in Stockholm  
and from the First People of the Kalahari in Botswana is expected to  
be delivered to broadcasters by AP Television News at 15:30 GMT today.

<p>The Right Livelihood Awards will be presented in the Swedish  
Parliament on Friday 9 December at 18:00. A number of seats will be  
available for the press. Please call us if you would like to attend.

<p>Founded in 1980, the Right Livelihood Awards are presented annually  
in the Swedish Parliament 'to honour and support those offering  
practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing  
us today'.
