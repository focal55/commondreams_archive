Solomon, executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, is the author of the new book <i>War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death</i>. He writes in a piece today: "The failure of the Bush administration to show military progress in Iraq has made the war politically vulnerable. But that line of critique leaves a somewhat clear field for the White House to keep claiming -- however implausibly -- that U.S. military forces and their Iraqi government allies are turning the corner and can look forward to Iraqization of the war. Today's White House line is akin to the 'light at the end of the tunnel' and Vietnamization talk 35 years ago. ... With the underpinnings of war prerogatives unchallenged, a predictable response is that the war must be fought more effectively. ... Countless pundits and politicians continue to decry the Bush administration's failure to come up with an effective strategy in Iraq. But the war has not gone wrong. It was always wrong. And the basic problem with the current U.S. war effort is that it exists."<br />

<b><a href="mailto:rjensen@uts.cc.utexas.edu">ROBERT JENSEN</a></b><br />
Jensen is author of the book <i>Citizens of the Empire: The Struggle to Claim Our Humanity</i>. He is a professor of journalism at the University of Texas. Jensen said today: "The call for withdrawal signals that people are willing to face the reality of the current situation in Iraq, which is an important shift. But the nature of the debate signals that some things haven't changed -- neither mainstream Democrawilling to face an honest discussion about why top policymakers in both parties wanted a war. Whatever the lies told about WMDs, the core of the U.S. motivation to invade Iraq was the drive to control the politics, and hence the energy resources, of the Middle East."<br />
