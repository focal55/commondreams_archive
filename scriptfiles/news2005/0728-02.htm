<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> QUANG TRI, Vietnam - July 27 - A 41 year-old man was killed by a Vietnam War-era piece of ordnance on July 22nd, 2005 in the Vinh Linh district of Quang Tri province, Vietnam. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nguyen Cuu Lam dicovered the bomb while working in the fields and was trying dismantle it to sell the metal for scrap when it exploded and killed him instantly.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many people in this poor, rural area resort to dismantling bombs they find in order to augment their meager incomes, often to deadly results. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the Vietnam War ended 30 years ago, by some estimates over 350,000 tons of bombs that did not detonate when dropped remain in the ground. This ordnance regularly claims lives and limbs in this still war-ravaged province. Since the conflict ended in 1975, nearly 40,000 Vietnamese have been killed by by these munitions. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clear Path International serves landmine and bomb accident survivors, their families and their communities in former war zones in Southeast Asia.
