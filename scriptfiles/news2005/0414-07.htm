The following are available for interviews:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BERNICE ROMERO, [via Caroline Green], <a href="mailto:Caroline.Green@oxfaminternational.org" target="_new">Caroline.Green@oxfaminternational.org</a>, <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/eng/pr050411_G7_debt.htm" target="_new">http://www.oxfam.org/eng/pr050411_G7_debt.htm</a>  Romero is international advocacy director for Oxfam. He said today: &quot;Since the G7 met in February, another 2 million people have died due to poverty.... As G7 finance leaders meet at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings this weekend, they must act to cancel 100 percent [of the] multilateral debt owed by the poorest countries. The IMF's own data clearly show that <br>selling a portion of its gold reserves to cancel poor countries' debts is a viable option. ... Currently, the world's poorest countries spend more on debt repayments -- $100 million a day -- than they do on health. For the cost of a cup of coffee per person each year in a developed country, 100 percent of the poorest countries' debts could be cancelled. Oxfam calculates it would cost just over $3 per person annually in the UK, $2.20 per person in Japan and Germany, $2.10 per Canadian citizen, $1.80 per person in France and just $1.20 per U.S. citizen, to cancel 100 percent of multilateral debt for 32 of the world's poorest countries.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Photo Advisory: On Friday, April 15, at 10 a.m., in the park outside the World Bank and IMF buildings, corner of 18th and Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C., a massive 10-foot-high clock face will be placed and will be officially &quot;turned on&quot; to start ticking -- the huge hands will symbolize that Every Second Counts -- one child dies every three seconds because of poverty. People from around the world will take part.]</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JONAH GOKOVA, LIDY NACPIL, <a href="mailto:gokov@ecoweb.co.zw" target="_new">gokov@ecoweb.co.zw</a>, <a href="mailto:lidyjs@jubileesouth.org" target="_new">lidyjs@jubileesouth.org</a>, <a href="http://www.jubileesouth.org/" target="_new">http://www.jubileesouth.org</a> Gokova chairs the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development and is the 2001 Winner of the Africa Prize for Leadership.

Setshedi is with the Anti-Privatization Forum in Johannesburg, South Africa. She has been active in the movement to reconnect electricity and water when they have been disconnected for people in Soweto. Setshedi said today: &quot;The people's movements in South Africa that liberated the country from apartheid are now focused on the neo-liberal privatization programs pushed by the World Bank and IMF. ... We are in solidarity with the movements in Africa and around the world that are turning back the profit-driven model of the World Bank and IMF, and creating real democracies that respond to the legitimate needs of the people.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Press Conference: &quot;Civil Society Discusses Opportunities for Debt Cancellation through G-7 Proposals,&quot; sponsored by Africa Action, Jubilee USA Network, and 50 Years is Enough Network, is scheduled at the National Press Club, Murrow Room, on April 14 at 1 p.m. An analysis of a leaked IMF report by finance expert Sony Kapoor [showing the feasibility of IMF gold sales to finance debt cancellation] will be released at the press conference.

Between 1970 and 2002, Africa received about $540 billion in loans and has already paid back <br>over $550 billion to wealthy creditors such as the G7 countries, the World Bank and the IMF. But interest charges mean Africa's debt stands at nearly $300 billion.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STEVE HELLINGER, <a href="mailto:shellinger@developmentgap.org" target="_new">shellinger@developmentgap.org</a>, <a href="http://www.ippinfo.org/" target="_new">http://www.ippinfo.org</a>, <a href="http://www.developmentgap.org/" target="_new">http://www.developmentgap.org</a> Hellinger is the president of Development GAP.

More than 1,000 parliamentarians from 50 parliaments around the world have signed a petition, which will be presented by 10 of their representatives to the World Bank and IMF on Friday, calling for a central role for national legislatures in the development, scrutinizing and ratifying of World Bank and IMF loan agreements.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[There will be a meeting with the World Bank and the IMF at 1 p.m. on Friday at the World Bank's J Building in room JB1-080.
