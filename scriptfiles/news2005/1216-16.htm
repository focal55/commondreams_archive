<p>WASHINGTON - December 16 - Contempt of court 
proceedings were today started against the Shell Petroleum Company of 
Nigeria (Shell) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 
for failing to comply with a court order. The order was issued by the 
Federal High Court of Nigeria on 14 November 2005, to stop flaring gas 
with immediate effect in Iwherekan community, Delta state. The court 
found gas flaring to be a 'gross violation' of the rights to life and 
dignity.

<p>People from the Iwherekan community have confirmed that flaring, a 
by-product of oil extraction, has continued unchecked since 14 November 
2005. Shell has therefore been in contempt of court since this date. The 
contempt of court notice is being filed by a member of the Iwherekan 
community in Delta State on behalf of himself and the Iwherekan 
community, with the support of Environmental Rights Action (Friends of 
the Earth Nigeria), the Climate Justice Program and Friends of the Earth.

<p>Across the Delta, the giant orange flares burn all day and night, many 
of them close to peoples' homes. Local communities suffer higher rates 
of respiratory diseases such as asthma because of the toxic chemicals in 
the gas and have to suffer constant noise, light and heat. Crop yields 
are damaged by air pollution.

<p>The flaring pumps clouds of black toxic smoke into the sky, causing more 
greenhouse gas emissions than any other single source in sub-Saharan 
Africa, according to the World Bank

<p>Nnimmo Bassey, Executive Director of Environmental Rights Action 
(Friends of the Earth Nigeria), said: "Since judgement was passed Shell 
has not halted her illegal activities. What we are witnessing is a clear 
demonstration of the fact that Shell has scant respect for the lives of 
the people in whose communities they carry on their business. While the 
people are dying, Shell cares only for her profits. We see a 
multinational corporation that has no respect for the rule of law but 
who at every turn loves to characterise local people as vandals and 
saboteurs. Who is the vandal: Shell or the people? Shell is contemptuous 
of our laws, of our peoples and of our environment. We are ashamed that 
our government is in an unholy wedlock with a corporation such as this."

<p>Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth International in Brussels says: 
"It is shocking that Shell continues to flare gas despite Nigeria's high 
court ruling that it is illegal and a breach of human rights. Shell has 
demonstrated once again that is doesn't have any respect for the people 
of the Niger Delta".

<p>Peter Roderick of the Climate Justice Programme said: "So soon after its 
fraud over Nigerian reserves, it's astonishing that Shell has not 
complied with this court order preventing it from continuing gross 
violations of human rights. Its behavior seriously undermines respect 
for the rule of law that its operations depend on."

</b>
<p>Contempt proceedings were filed today, 16 December 2005, by Mr Jonah 
Gbemre, on behalf of himself and the Iwherekan community, Delta State at 
the Federal High Court of Nigeria, sitting in Benin City, against the 
Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria and the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation.

<p>On 14 November 2004, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria 
and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation were ordered by the 
Federal High Court of Nigeria to stop flaring gas in the Iwherekan 
community, in the Niger Delta, as it violates the rights to life and 
dignity, guaranteed under the Constitution of Nigeria. The Judge also 
declared that the gas flaring laws were "unconstitutional, null and void".

<p>Shell has appealed against the High Court's ruling on procedural 
grounds, challenging the court's competence to try the case, and against 
the judgment. However, without a 'stay of execution' this does not free 
Shell from its obligation to immediately end flaring in Iwherekan 
community. No stay of execution has been granted. An application for a 
stay of execution by Shell and NNPC is due to be heard on 20 December 2005.

<p>This original case brought by Mr Jonah Gbemre, on behalf of himself and 
the Iwherekan community in Delta State, supported by Environmental 
Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA) and the Climate Justice 
Programme (CJP).

<p>All the major multinational oil companies in Nigeria flare gas, in joint 
ventures with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, and the 
breadth of the ruling makes it clear that their flaring is also illegal.

<p>The ruling recognizes that gas flaring is a serious human rights 
violation; a violation which has gone unchecked for almost 50 years 
across the Delta earning profits for oil companies including Shell while 
contributing to the degradation of the local environment, on which local 
communities depend, and to global climate change. Nigeria has been the 
world's biggest gas flarer and the practice has contributed more 
greenhouse gas emissions than all other sources in sub-Saharan Africa 
combine, as well as poisoning localities with a cocktail of toxins. 
Furthermore, the practice costs Nigeria about US$2.5 billion annually, 
while 66% of its population live on less than US$1 a day.

<p>The Climate Justice Programme is an initiative hosted by Friends of the 
Earth International. It aims to encourage and support the enforcement of 
the law internationally to combat climate change. Over 70 organisations 
and lawyers are signatories to its Statement of Support, including 
Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, WWF and organizations based in 
developing countries: www.climatelaw.org.
