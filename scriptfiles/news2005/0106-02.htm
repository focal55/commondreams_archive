<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 6 -- News Advisory: ReDefeatBush's &quot;Defend Democracy, Support the Challenge&quot; rally will begin at NOON on Thursday January 6 at Upper Senate Park at Constitution Avenue and the U.S. Capitol. It is anticipated that C-SPAN, NBC and RadioLeft.com will provide coverage.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers will include Green Party Presidential candidate David Cobb, Columbus Ohio School Board Member Rev. Bill Moss, ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel, former Florida Congressman Peter Deutsch, voting rights activist Granny D, Buddy George of Veterans for Kerry, constitutional scholar Asa Gordon of the Douglas Institute of Politics, chief litigator for the Moss v. Bush lawsuit challenging the Ohio election Peter Peckarsky, investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, election law attorney Cynthia Butler and individual citizens from Ohio telling their stories of the vote suppression techniques engaged in by Republican Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell and others to block their access to the electoral system.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers who are anticipated but whose participation cannot be confirmed include Rev. Jesse Jackson, attorney Lowell Finley of the challenge to the election results in New Mexico and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scheduled musical guests include the Swing States Road Show, Yikes McGee, and Jack Chernos and his Department of Justice. It is anticipated that prior to the start of the event the Sons and Daughters of Liberty Fife and Drum Corps performing as a drums- only group without fifes. Games include Pin the Tale on the Donkey, to remind the Democrats that their willingness once again to accept a fraudulent election on behalf of America's political opposition will further undermine their claim to lead it.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers should report to Michael North, the event's stage manager. Other potential speakers will be accomodated on a space available basis. Working press should find Andy Solomon, who will be handling media relations on site for ReDefeatBush.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope people will stay as long as the challenge continues,&quot; said ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel, &quot;whether that turns out to be several hours or several days.&quot; Participants are invited to bring flashlights and candles so that the vigil may continue after sunset if the challenge has not yet been resolved.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This event follows ReDefeatBush's very successful Rallies for the Republic in Boston on Monday and San Francisco on Tuesday, both of which played to packed houses and enthusiastic audiences.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ReDefeatBush's next major public event is scheduled to be the CounterInaugural and CounterInaugural Ball on 1/20. During the daytime ReDefeatBush will operate stages across from Union Station on Capitol Hill and at the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. Green Party Vice Presidential candidate Pat Lemarche will host the Capitol Hill stage with performers to be announced next week. America's foremost first-person historian Clay Jenkinson will appear at the Thomas Jefferson Memorial as Thomas Jefferson, a role he has performed at the White House and at events nationwide. He will answer audience questions as he would expect Jefferson himself to have answered. ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel will reprise a role he first performed 10 years ago as Alexis de Tocqueville, author of Democracy in America. He will also interact with the crowd in the person of Tocqueville, one of the most precscient and insightful observers of how democracy was practiced in early America.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to ensure that the CounterInaugural events are as family friendly as possible ReDefeatBush will be sponsoring the Old Town Trolley which that day will act as a shuttle service connecting the various counterinaugural stages and will be providing public restroom facilities. &quot;Since tickets are now required to even view the inaugural parade we invite DC residents, the overwhelming majority of whom supported the other guy, and our out of town guests to join us at our teargas and direction-action free events, which will be significantly more accessible for parents and interesting for children than the inaugural itself,&quot; said ReDefeatBush founder David Lytel.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That evening ReDefeatBush is sponsoring a massive CounterInaugural Ball at Dream, the largest nightclub in DC. Tickets for guests 30 years of age or under are just $30 and are $60 for guests older than 30. VIP and Penthouse tickets are also available. Guests will receive a complete dinner buffet from 7 until 9 PM, during which time there will be open bar. Musical guests will be announced closer to the event. Tickets are available at http://www.counterinauguralball.org</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, at 10:00 that night the name ReDefeatBush will be retired and the new name revealed in a video presentation. The video will be made during the daytime with footage from all of the counterinaugural stages and will include speeches, performances, and interviews. It will be shown at Dream and also be multicast over the Internet to a worldwide audience. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
