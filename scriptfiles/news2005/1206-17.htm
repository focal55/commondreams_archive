<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - December 6 - The American Civil Liberties Union today welcomed the final 
report of the 9/11 Public Discourse Project, noting that the successor 
organization to the 9/11 Commission did not call for a further expansion of the 
Patriot Act. Congress is currently working to pass legislation to reauthorize 
provisions of that law that are scheduled to "sunset," or expire, at the end of 
this year.</font></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Congress must take note that the findings do not call for a further erosion 
of the Bill of Rights by expanding the Patriot Act," said Caroline Fredrickson, 
Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "Indeed, the 9/11 
Commissioners&#8217; main concerns with the Patriot Act focused on distribution of 
funding for homeland security. As Congress works to reauthorize and hopefully 
fix the Patriot Act, we urge lawmakers to take steps to ensure that America is 
both safe <I>and</I> free."</font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a final "report card" issued by the 9/11 Public Discourse Project, the 
former 9/11 Commission gave the "balance between security and civil liberties" a 
B grade, noting that "The debate surrounding reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act 
has been strong, and concern for civil liberties has been at the heart of it. 
Robust and continuing oversight, both within the Executive and by the Congress, 
will be essential." The ACLU agreed that while debate on the issues has been 
strong, oversight and disclosure by the government on the use of the Patriot Act 
has remained inadequate and certainly does not warrant such a grade.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, in recent weeks, it has been discovered that the FBI has issued 
tens of thousands of National Security Letters (NSLs), a secretive power 
expanded by the Patriot Act to gather private records about Americans without 
any connection between the records sought and suspected foreign terrorist. These 
NSLs are issued unilaterally by the FBI -- without the approval or review of 
independent judge-- and can now be used to obtain some of our most private and 
sensitive records, including Internet and financial transactions.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final report also slammed the lack of steps taken to create a strong and 
functional Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and the implementation of 
guidelines for the government sharing of personal information. Both of these 
measures were included in the legislation that restructured the nation&#8217;s 
intelligence agencies.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Commissioners also noted that the government has failed to improve 
airline passenger pre-screening. The ACLU and its allies from across the 
political spectrum have had strong objections and concerns with the proposed 
Secure Flight screening program, noting that it would unnecessarily intrude on 
the privacy of air passengers without enhancing security.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report card also touched on the issue of the standardization of secure 
identification cards. Early this year, Congress approved the REAL ID Act, which 
imposes federal standards on state identification documents. The ACLU and other 
privacy advocates noted that this created a <I>de facto</I> national ID card 
that would threaten the privacy of innocent Americans facilitate government 
surveillance of their activities.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Too many of the steps taken since 9/11 only give a false sense of security 
and create a true threat to civil liberties," Fredrickson added. "Without 
substantive corrections as well as meaningful oversight and --better 
transparency and disclosure-- America will be ceding our Bill of Rights to 
fear."</font></P>
