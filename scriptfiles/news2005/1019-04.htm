<p>   BOSTON - International relief  organization Oxfam is taking innovative measures to fill the gaps  in shelter for the hundreds of thousands of people left homeless  by the recent South Asian earthquake.</p>
<p>   The immediate need for thermal tents, combined with the  massive logistical challenges of getting aid to the most remote  areas, is putting thousands of victims of the quake in danger.</p>
<p>   &quot;The lack of easily available tents means we have to think of  new ways of doing things fast,&quot; said Ray Offenheiser, president  of Oxfam America. &quot;Despite formidable challenges getting supplies  in and around the quake zone, we're integrating the production  and distribution of tents that will protect people from the  cold.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;We've already purchased a production line at a tent factory  in Pakistan and we're looking for additional solutions,&quot; added  Ashok Prasad, an Oxfam aid worker in the region.   &quot;In India,  we've just designed and built a shelter that people can put  together themselves from locally available materials.  These  temporary shelters could house thousands -- and be the difference  between life and death,&quot; Prasad said.</p>
<p>   The tents have been in development for the past five years,  and have been tested weather endurance in cold storage warehouses  and in wind tunnels.  Following are further details about their  construction:</p>
<p>   -- Each tent costs approximately $140 per unit.</p>
<p>   -- Each unit sleeps a family of six.</p>
<p>   -- The tents are constructed using locally available  materials, - plastic sheeting, ordinary plastic piping, felt  insulation, rope.</p>
<p>   -- Their design maximizes internal living space, which is  especially important for the winter and long periods spent inside  the tent.</p>
<p>   -- Well insulated: the tents retain heat with layers designed  to trap air.</p>
<p>   -- They are easily constructed and require no tools to put  together.</p>
<p>   -- Oxfam will produce and distribute 20,000 tents from a  factory in Lahore, Pakistan.</p>
