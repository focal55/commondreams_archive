<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 3 -- Born in the once peaceful state of Nepal, Ramesh Singh now heads the worldwide charitable organization, ActionAid International, which serves the poor in some 50 countries. He will be available for interviews Feb. 9 and 10.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for Nepal's crisis, Singh fears, that as in most emergencies, the poor will be hardest hit by its recent declaration of a state of emergency and its suspension of parliamentary democracy. Political uncertainty will make development work more difficult, disrupt peace building and plunge Nepal's already fragile economy into crisis. As one of the world's least developed countries, Nepal can ill afford this.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Says Singh, &quot;We have many concerns about the state of emergency. We are worried about the safety and security of workers and leaders of civil society organizations, including ActionAid and its partner organizations.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 40 percent of Nepal's population of 26.5 million lives below the poverty line. The country has had nine governments since 1990. A nine-year conflict between the government and Maoist rebels has seen the death of over 11,000 people.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ActionAid International has been working in Nepal since 1982, assisting approximately 600,000 individuals in 19 districts. The agency promotes and protects the rights of those living in poverty, and works with them to meet their basic needs, including education, healthcare and the opportunity to earn a living.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Ramesh Singh has worked with ActionAid for 20 years, first serving its agriculture and water programs in The Gambia, then serving as Country Director in Ethiopia, Nepal, and Vietnam respectively. Three years after gaining the post of Asia Regional Director, Singh was named ActionAid International's Executive Director. Prior to joining ActionAid International, his career centered upon agricultural education and research within Nepal. He is available to speak about the Nepalese crisis, tsunami relief, the African AIDS crisis, and other aid-related issues while in D.C. this February.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
