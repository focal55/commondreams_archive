<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->NEW YORK - September 8 - The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) issued a special report, The Guantánamo Prisoner Hunger Strikes & Protests: February 2002 – August 2005, chronicling the origins and scope of the major hunger strikes by prisoners at the detention center at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station.  The Guantánamo Prisoner Hunger Strikes & Protests report raises concerns about the ethical responsibilities of military medical personnel’s treatment of hunger strike participants.

 

<p>According to the CCR report,

 

<p><i>Hunger strikes that began in early 2002 as a means to protest the uncertainty of the prisoners’ legal status have escalated three years later into the detainees’ willingness to strike until death unless they are afforded a fair hearing and humane treatment.  Despite the increasing severity of the Guantánamo detainees’ protest, the United States appears no closer to ending its unlawful practices.  </i>—     The Guantánamo Prisoner Hunger Strikes & Protests: February 2002 – August 2005

<p>CCR attorney Gitanjali Gutierrez, who authored the report, stated, “The men detained in Guantánamo are seeking access to the federal courts as mandated over a year ago by the United States Supreme Court in Rasul v. Bush.  It is astounding that men in U.S. custody are willing to engage in a hunger strike until they are afforded a fair hearing or they die of starvation. Most troubling today is the government’s argument that the President may imprison individuals outside the law, a position that disregards the prisoners’ rights in the face of increasingly life-threatening hunger strikes.”

<p>The report includes:

<p>
<ul>
<li>A brief overview of the ethical responsibilities of physicians to abstain from force-feeding imprisoned hunger strike participants;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Department of  Defense documents used during its monitoring of hunger strikers at Guantánamo;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Statements from current and released detainees describing the purposes of the major hunger strikes beginning in 2002 through the present;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Documentation of the Department of Defense’s efforts to withhold information about striking prisoners from their families and legal counsel as well as from public scrutiny; and<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Recommendations for ending the United States’ unconscionable policies at Guantánamo leading to the hunger strikes.

</li>
</ul>
