<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HAITI  - July 26 - Catholic priest G&eacute;rard Jean-Juste was taken into custody at a police station &quot;for his own protection&quot;  on 21 July, after he was assaulted, but while he was at the police station he was accused of murder. He was abroad at the time of the murder of which he has been accused, but he is a prominent opponent of the government. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, detained solely because he has peacefully exercised his right to freedom of expression. He risks spending a long time in custody awaiting trial on apparently trumped-up charges.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rev. Jean-Juste has been an outspoken supporter of former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and critic of the present government, in his sermons and in radio broadcasts. On 21 July he attended the funeral of journalist Jacques Roche, at a church in the P&eacute;tionville suburb of the capital, Port-au-Prince. He was assaulted and threatened by a mob outside the church, who said he was one of those responsible for the violence that is sweeping the capital. He was taken to P&eacute;tionville police station by officers from the Haitian police and the UN civilian police force, CIVPOL. None of his attackers is known to have been detained. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the police station, officer Jean-Daniel Ulysse, from the Central Command of the Judicial Police (Direction Centrale de la Police Judiciaire, DCPJ) accused him of the murder of the journalist. Although he was supposedly there simply for his own safety, he was locked up in a cell at the police station with another 43 detainees. The following day he was transferred to the National Penitentiary, where he is in solitary confinement. According to his lawyer, he has reportedly been charged with the murder of Jacques Roche. However, Rev. Jean-Juste and his lawyers were not shown an arrest warrant or any other official statement of the charges. He is one of dozens of Aristide supporters who have been arbitrarily detained in this way. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Journalist Jacques Roche was kidnapped on 10 July, and murdered when the full ransom demanded was not paid. Rev. Jean-Juste was in the United Sates at the time, returning from Miami on 15 July.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rev. Jean-Juste has been a target for government repression for some time. On 13 October 2004, he was arrested by police without a warrant at his church, Saint Claire's, in Port-au-Prince. A warrant issued on 18 October accused him of &#147;plotting against the internal security of the state.&#148; He was released on 29 November, after six weeks in custody. When he flew in from Miami on 15 July, he was stopped at Port-au-Prince airport, searched and questioned. He was ordered to present himself to the judicial police on 18 July, and two days later he was questioned by the investigating magistrate, regarding the accusation leading to his October arrest. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted on 29 February 2004, after an armed rebellion led by former military officers took control of the whole country. The same day, a US-led multinational force was deployed in Haiti, authorised by the UN Security Council. An interim government was put in place in early March with G&eacute;rard Latortue sworn in as Prime Minister. In June 2004, the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was sent to assist the interim government in securing the country, reforming the national police and protecting human rights. Since October 2004, the violence has escalated, particularly in the capital, where armed gangs, some of which allegedly have political affiliations to Aristide's party, are responsible for numerous killings and grave human rights abuses. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in French, English or your own language:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- expressing concern at the arrest and detention without formal charges of Rev.
