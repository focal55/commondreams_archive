<p>WASHINGTON - December 15 – Amid growing national concern over flaws with

capital punishment, the New Jersey Senate Thursday approved a

one-year ban on executions in the state and said it would study

how the death penalty is administered.

 

<p>If the legislation is approved by the New Jersey General Assembly

in January, New Jersey’s Legislature will become the first since

executions resumed in the 1970s to approve a moratorium. Two other

states – Illinois and Maryland – enacted moratoriums as a result

of executive orders.

 

<p>The bill, sponsored by Democrat Reed Gisciora and Republican

Christopher ‘Kip’ Bateman, passed on a strong 30 to 6 vote.

NCADP helped its affiliate, New Jerseyans for Alternatives to

the Death Penalty, by mobilizing death penalty opponents in

New Jersey and urging them to contact their state senators.

 

<p>New Jersey’s action comes at a time when voters increasingly

are questioning whether innocent people are sentenced to death.

Just last month, the Houston Chronicle published an investigative

series strongly suggesting that a person executed in Texas,

Ruben Cantu, may well have been innocent.

 

“Across the country, people are becoming increasingly aware that

the death penalty risks executing the innocent and discriminates

on the basis of race, geography and whether one can afford a good

lawyer,” said Diann Rust-Tierney, executive director of the

National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. “New Jersey

legislators are responding to this growing awareness. No one

wants an innocent person to spend even one day on death row,

much less be executed.”

 

<p>Rust-Tierney noted that two other states, California and North Carolina,

have approved bills creating commissions that will study the death

penalty. She predicted that within the next two years a number of 

states will debate abolition and moratorium bills, other death

penalty reforms and bills to examine capital punishment.
