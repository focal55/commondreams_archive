<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TULSA - July 20  -</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Green Party of the United States will hold its 2005 Annual National Meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma on July 21-24.  The event will be held on the campus of the University of Tulsa and is hosted by the Green Country Greens of Tulsa and the Green Party of Oklahoma (GPOK).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the event, delegates from state Green parties will gather to decide national party direction and priorities for the coming year.  There will also be numerous training and committee sessions in which delegates can learn skills and engage with party members from other locales.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The keynote speaker for the Annual Meeting will be Maine State Representative and Green Party member, John Eder.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oklahoma Green Party members are honored to be hosting an event of this scope.  &quot;Our hope is that this meeting will help to legitimize the potential for alternative party politics in Oklahoma.  Oklahoma needs more than two political choices,&quot; said Joni LeViness (Tulsa), one of the Oklahoma delegates to the annual meeting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rachel Jackson, Meeting Coordinator and Co-Chair of the Oklahoma Green Party, said, &quot;As a newly accredited state party, Oklahoma has only recently become a member of Green Party of the United States, but Oklahoma has been a home for progressives since its statehood.  Past the stereotypes and prejudices about Okies, Oklahomans have a history rich with the values of cooperation and community, within which local government, economic fairness, and accountability were ways of life.  The Green Party platform advocates these same ideas.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of Oklahoma hopes the Annual National Meeting in Tulsa will increase the growing interest in the Green movement in Oklahoma.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GPOK will also be holding a fundraising dinner at 7 p.m. Friday, July 22nd, at Woodward Park in Tulsa.  The dinner will feature a BBQ buffet meal of primarily Oklahoma-grown food (vegetarian meal options will be available).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Admission to this event is $10/person and the public is invited.  Proceeds will be used to fund state and local Green Party work in Oklahoma.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Oklahoma Green Party is dedicated to the principles of grassroots democracy, social and economic justice, ecological wisdom and nonviolence.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The party has local chapters in Oklahoma County, Cleveland County, Green Country, as well as a Rural Greens chapter and a student chapter at Classen School of Advanced Studies in Oklahoma City.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The University of Tulsa does not promote or support any particular political party.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Two press conferences are scheduled: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) Friday, July 22 at 11:00 a.m., introducing the meeting and covering recent Green Party developments nationally and in Oklahoma; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2) Saturday, July 23 at 11:00, introducing Green candidates from around the U.S.  Both press conferences will take place in the Allen Chapman Activity Center (in the Gallery), East 5th Place, on the campus of the University of Tulsa.
