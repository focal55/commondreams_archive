<p>WASHINGTON - On October 9, <span class="media_outlet">Parade</span> magazine--the Sunday newspaper supplement with a circulation of 34.5 million, making it the country's most widely distributed magazine--published an inaccurate smear against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The smear, appearing in the Q&amp;A column "Walter Scott's Personality Parade," was a response to a letter writer who wanted to know "where Fidel Castro gets the dough to shore up his bankrupt regime."  Scott's full answer was:<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="sideindent">"In the wake of the collapse of the USSR, which bankrolled him to the tune of $4 billion a year, Castro has turned to Hugo Chavez, Marxist president of Venezuela, the world's fifth-largest oil exporter. In addition to shoring up Castro, he's funding revolutionaries and terrorists throughout Latin America."</div><br />

<br />
<br />
Scott's two-sentence response managed to misrepresent several issues. Chavez is not a Marxist; asked about his politics by the left-wing publication <span class="media_outlet">CounterPunch</span> (8/16/04), Chavez replied: "I don't believe in the dogmatic postulates of Marxist revolution. I don't  accept that we are living in a period of proletarian revolutions....  Are we aiming in Venezuela today for the abolition of private property or a classless society? I don't think so."  Chavez describes himself as a Bolivarian, a follower of the 19th Century Latin American independence leader Simon Bolivar.<br />
<br />
And while <a href="index.php?page=18&amp;region_id=2">Venezuela</a> does provide discounted oil to Cuba, more than 20,000 Cuban doctors are sent to work in Venezuela in exchange; the relationship is mutually beneficial.<br />
<br />
As for Scott's claim that Chavez is funding "revolutionaries and terrorists throughout Latin America," <span class="media_outlet">Parade</span> should provide evidence for this charge or issue a retraction.  The U.S. State Department, hardly a pro-Chavez source, does not include Venezuela among the list of state sponsors of <a href="index.php?page=7&amp;issue_area_id=39">terrorism</a> in its most recent "Country Reports on Terrorism" (4/05).  The report's section on Venezuela only alleges that "it is unclear to what extent" Venezuela might support any of the principal combatants in Colombia's long-running civil war. The report goes on to mention, however, that the Colombia and Venezuela governments have cooperated on some terrorism-related cases, and that several Venezuelan National Guard officers were reportedly killed by FARC forces near the border between the two countries.<br />

<br />
While some anti-Chavez partisans have claimed that Chavez supports various terrorist groups, they have failed to back up these allegations with evidence.  For example, Pat Robertson--the right-wing televangelist who has called for Chavez's assassination (<span class="media_outlet">700 Club</span>, 8/22/05)--recently claimed on <span class="media_outlet">CNN</span> (10/9/05) that Chavez "sent $1.2 million in cash to Osama bin Laden right after 9/11." When asked for evidence, Robertson could only claim that "sources that came to me" told him of the transaction.<br />
<br />
"Walter Scott" is the pseudonym of Edward Klein, the author of the <i>The Truth About Hillary</i>, a biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton that is riddled with errors (<span class="media_outlet">Media Matters</span>, 6/23/05). Klein's book relies overwhelmingly on anonymous sources to make a series of lurid claims and innuendos, asking peculiar questions like, "Were there any telltale signs on the presidential sheets that [Hillary and Bill Clinton] ever had sex with each other?" Klein's book also floats the suggestion that that Chelsea Clinton was conceived as a result of Bill Clinton raping Hillary while on vacation in Bermuda.  Perhaps <span class="media_outlet">Parade</span> should consider whether "Scott"'s journalism deserves closer scrutiny.<br />

<br />
