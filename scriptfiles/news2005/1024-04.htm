<p>WASHINGTON - On yesterday’s (NBC) Meet the Press, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) was revealed as a hypocrite.  When asked how the White House should respond if Karl Rove or Scooter Libby is indicted, Sen. Hutchison stated that if there were an indictment, she hoped it would be for “a crime and not some perjury technicality where they could not indict on the crime.” Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (Walter Pincus, Resignations May Follow Charges, The Washington Post, October 24, 2005).<br />
<br />
This statement contradicts the Senator’s 1999 view expressed during the impeachment of President Clinton when she said, “The edifice of American jurisprudence rests on the foundation of the due process of law. The mortar in that foundation is the oath. Those who seek to obstruct justice weaken that foundation, and those who violate the oath would tear the whole structure down.”<br />

<br />
Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington stated, “I would expect a member of the United States Senate to judge any government official’s actions based on the rule of law, not on party affiliation.  As a Senator charged with upholding the laws of the United States, Sen. Hutchison should be ashamed and embarrassed by her flagrant inconsistency.  She owes her constituents and the nation an explanation.”</p>
