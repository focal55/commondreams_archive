<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 24 -- Today, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance, issued the following statement in response to the Senate filibuster compromise:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate compromise is a victory for the rules of the Senate and the separation of powers.  While we are pleased that this deal takes the unprecedented 'nuclear option' off the table, we are very disappointed that it still allows some of President Bush's most extreme judicial nominees such as William Pryor to move forward. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge Senators to thoroughly examine the merits of each judicial nominee and to oppose those who are a threat to religious liberty in America.  Using the language of the compromise itself, we hope a majority of senators will reject Mr. Pryor's nomination because he represents an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot; through his failure to support religious diversity and his lack of commitment to maintaining the institutional separation of religion and government. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope this compromise ensures that the integrity of future Supreme Courts remains protected from the undue influences of a vocal, radical faction of the right that is completely out of step with mainstream America. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am particularly pleased that the senators involved in the compromise specifically cite the U. S. Constitution's requirement that the President must seek the advice and consent of the Senate.  Along with those Senators, we encourage President Bush to return to the time-honored, constitutional process in which the President of the United States consults with Republican and Democratic Senators and considers their advice before making nominations. <br> <br>&quot;The Interfaith Alliance urges the president to realize that nominees who are clearly out of the mainstream of our nation's judicial philosophy will fail to inspire trust and confidence in the American people.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Gaddy is available for comment and interviews on this or other issues relating to the intersection of religion and politics.<br>Contact: Don Parker, 202.639.6370 ext. 111. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a nonpartisan, grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote a narrow, divisive agenda.
