<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - August 15 -  U.S. presidents have long rewarded big campaign donors, fundraisers and other loyalists with ambassadorships to desirable countries around the world, and President Bush is no exception.

<p>At least 40 well-connected individuals who have contributed or raised generous amounts of money to help elect Republican candidates since Bush's first campaign for president are currently serving or have been nominated by him to serve as ambassadors.

<p>As a group, they and their immediate families gave a total of $8.8 million to federal candidates and political parties between 1999 and 2004. Of that, $7.7 million, or 88 percent, went to Republicans. Nearly 9 percent, or $757,000, went directly to Bush's two presidential campaigns, his two inaugural funds and the Florida recount fund he formed following the 2000 election.

<p>Twenty-three of the 40 ambassadors and nominees were top Bush fundraisers, raising at least $100,000 for one or both of the president's campaigns for the White House.

<p>Almost all of the nearly $974,000 contributed by the group to Democrats came from Roland Arnall, the billionaire owner of Ameriquest Capital Corp. who Bush nominated last month to be the U.S. envoy to the Netherlands. Arnall and his wife contributed nearly $943,000 to Democrats over the period studied. Their contributions to Republicans were slightly higher, totaling more than $1.1 million.

<p>Not counting the Arnalls' contributions, the remaining ambassadors and nominees donated a total of $6.7 million between 1999 and 2004, of which nearly $6.6 million, or 98 percent, went to Republicans. Totals include contributions to third parties.

<p>The presidential practice of awarding ambassadorships to donors and fundraisers goes back at least as far as Franklin Roosevelt, who nominated Joseph Kennedy to serve in Great Britain. Presidents traditionally reserve about a third of all ambassadorships for friends and political loyalists.

<p>In his first term, Bush nominated the likes of Richard Egan, chairman of data storage giant EMC, to be ambassador to Ireland, and investor Mercer Reynolds as envoy to Switzerland. Egan and his wife contributed $480,100 during the 2000 election cycle alone to Republican candidates and party committees, the Bush-Cheney Inaugural Committee and Florida recount fund. Reynolds and his wife gave a total of more than $456,000 to Republican causes that cycle.

<p>Arnall is by far the biggest Republican donor of the current crop of ambassadors and nominees. His $1.1 million to the GOP between 1999 and 2004 includes a $1 million contribution to the RNC in October 2002 by his wife, Dawn. She also contributed $5 million in August of last year to Progress for America, a Republican-leaning group that worked for Bush's reelection.

<p>Roland and Dawn each were listed as Bush Rangers last year for having raised at least $200,000 for the president's campaign. Roland's company, Ameriquest, contributed a total of $1,000,000 to the president's second inaugural committee. (Company contributions are not included in an individual's totals.)

<p>Investment banker Ronald Spogli, nominated to be ambassador to Italy, is the second-highest Republican donor on the roster of ambassadors and nominees. He and his wife contributed nearly $803,000 to Republicans between 1999 and 2004, including $100,000 to Bush's first inaugural committee. The gave nothing to Democrats.

<p>Spogli, who was Bush's classmate at Harvard Business School, founded the Los Angeles-based investment firm of Freeman Spogli with fellow Bush loyalist Brad Freeman. Spogli attained Pioneer status in both 2000 and 2004 for having raised at least $100,000 for each of Bush's presidential campaigns.

<p>The third-highest donor is GOP fundraiser Catherine Todd Bailey, who is currently serving as ambassador to Latvia. Bailey and her husband, a venture capitalist and former insurance company executive, contributed nearly $621,000 to Republicans between 1999 and 2004. Bailey was listed as a Bush Ranger last year; her husband achieved Pioneer status.

<p>During the 2004 election, Bailey served as Kentucky finance chairwoman for the Bush campaign. She once served as co-chair of Republican Regents, a donor designation of the Republican National Committee.

<p>In all, six ambassadors and nominees, and their immediate families, contributed at least $500,000 to Republicans between 1999 and 2004. Twenty-one gave at least $100,000.
