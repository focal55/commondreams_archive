<p>MONTREAL - December 7 - Ministers arriving in Montreal for the UN Climate Talks must push ahead for 
international action and not allow the US administration to hold the world 
hostage, Friends of the Earth urged today (Wednesday 7th December).  The 
world's biggest polluter has refused to enter in to dialogue on future 
action on tackling climate change at the talks and has walked away from 
efforts by other countries to bring it on board.

<p>Friends of the Earth International is urging Minister Dion as president of 
the talks, and Margaret Beckett, UK Secretary of State for the Environment, 
negotiating here on behalf of the EU, to strive for concrete outcomes from 
these talks.  It is calling for a commitment to a clear timetable and 
process for future negotiations under the Kyoto Protocol.  This means 
abandoning the flawed strategy of trying to bring the US on board.

<p>The environmental campaign group also wants to see industrialised countries 
recognise their responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol and commit to 
deepening their emissions cuts as well as providing financial support for 
the developing countries to embark on a clean development path.

<p>Speaking in Montreal, Friends of the Earth International Vice Chair Tony 
Juniper said:
"Ministers must use the next few days to aim for a historic breakthrough on 
taking forward action under the Kyoto Protocol.  People expect their 
governments to act - and that means industrialised countries must commit to 
a clear timeline for developing new targets and action by 2008, ready for 
implementation in the second phase of the Protocol in 2013.

<p>"By reaching such an agreement, countries negotiating here will be sending a 
clear signal that low carbon economies are the future. These talks have seen 
positive moves from developing countries to face up to the challenge of 
tackling climate change.  But the emerging economies must also be given the 
support and assistance they need to move down a sustainable energy track."

<p>Current funding mechanisms for the least developed countries do not match 
the level of need and many developed countries have failed to pay in the 
amounts promised.  Assistance is also needed in the form of pilot projects 
to show that sustainable energy solutions are a practical option for 
developing economies.

<p>Commenting on the position of the UK Government, which currently holds the 
presidency of the European Union, Tony Juniper added:

<p>"These talks are a key test of the UK and the EU's commitment to tackling 
climate change.  They have rightly wanted to bring the United States on 
board - but the sad reality is that the current administration is not 
interested in addressing the problem.  Action is already happening in 
America, with business and local government moving forward.  The world must 
move ahead in the expectation that future US governments will be more 
willing to join in."
