<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 25 -- The top safety official for the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
  has abruptly resigned as concerns over mishandling of toxic residues from prison 
  industry computer recycling operations spread from one prison to other facilities, 
  according to agency emails released today by Public Employees for Environmental 
  Responsibility (PEER).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 16, Steven Tussey resigned as National Safety Administrator for the 
  federal prison system effective June 2. His abrupt retirement after only three 
  years on the job raises questions about findings of a system-wide review that 
  seven computer recycling prison enterprises are exposing both prison staff and 
  inmates to harmful levels of toxic materials.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This spring, Leroy Smith, the safety manager at Atwater Federal Prison, a maximum-security 
  institution located just outside of Merced, California, went public with documents 
  that inmates using hammers for breaking computer terminals down to components 
  parts for recycling are also spewing particles of heavy metals, such as lead, 
  cadmium, barium and beryllium, over themselves and civilian prison staff. The 
  factory at Atwater also provided an open food service in the contaminated work 
  areas.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, safety officials at the Federal Correctional Institution at Elkton (Ohio) 
  are raising similar red flags about their facility&#8217;s computer recycling 
  operation. Filters coated with lead dust have been routinely been handled by 
  untrained staff and improperly stored in open bins. Neither staff nor inmates 
  were warned of dangers of direct exposure to the toxic dust that coated their 
  hair, skin and clothing every day.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;The Attorney General is supposed to oversee the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
  but oversight from the Attorney General is nowhere to be seen,&#8221; stated 
  PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch, noting that a Department of Justice response 
  to a November 15, 2004 referral of Leroy Smith&#8217;s whistleblower disclosure 
  is four months overdue. &#8220;Given the past record of Alberto Gonzales on 
  issues of prisoner mistreatment, he should be stepping up to the plate on this 
  investigation, not hiding behind subordinates.&#8221;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides Atwater and Elkton, five other federal prisons have similar computer 
  recycling plants: Ft. Dix (NJ), Lewisburg (PA), Marianna (FL), Texarkana (TX) 
  and Tucson (AZ). The Federal Bureau of Prisons is part of the U.S. Department 
  of Justice, headed by Attorney General and former White House Counsel, Alberto 
  Gonzales. Consequently, Gonzales is now in charge of one of the world&#8217;s 
  largest prison systems. <br>
  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smith, who first brought these problems to light, is now a magnet for his colleagues 
  in the other facilities who were unaware of the health risks. San Francisco 
  attorney Mary Dryovage, who is representing Smith, in a whistleblower action 
  that seeks transfer out of Atwater and restoration of a lost promotion, commented 
  that, &#8220;The Federal Bureau of Prisons is now on a campaign to discredit 
  Leroy Smith, a 13-year employee with a spotless record and past performance 
  awards, rather than figuring out how to address the health and safety problems.&#8221;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="../../docs/ca/05_25_5_resignation.pdf">See
