<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - Amidst soaring gas prices and disaster on the gulf coast, students across the country are helping to launch a new national campaign to cut America&#8217;s oil use in half by 2020. &nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign&#8212;called &#8220;Project 2020&#8221;&#8212;is America&#8217;s foremost student-led effort dedicated to demonstrating the connection between US oil dependence and our economy, environment and national security. &nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
In early August, Project 2020 students were flown to Washington, DC for a weeklong training that culminated with a global oil supply crisis simulation. &nbsp;The training and simulation provided the students with the tools they need to connect our country&#8217;s dependence on foreign oil to its negative effects on gas prices, severe storms, military intervention and terrorism. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&#8220;With rising gas prices and an increasing threat to our national security, it is imperative that we address the problems associated with America&#8217;s dependence on oil,&#8221; explained Siulan Thomas of Denton, TX. &nbsp;&#8220;Our current consumption habits are deteriorating our environment, national security and our already tiny wallets. &nbsp;It&#8217;s time for a change and we should not sit back and do nothing if we care about our future.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
Starting this fall, Siulan and her peers will be working on their campuses and in the broader community as 20/20 Vision Regional Directors to address these concerns. &nbsp;The group plans to introduce a national pledge campaign in late September to encourage Americans to cut their personal oil consumption in half by 2020 and will organize several events throughout the year on and around their campuses. &nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&#8220;Katrina has opened our eyes to the oil crisis,&#8221; said 20/20 Vision Executive Director Tom Collina. &#8220;If we kick the oil habit we can bring gas prices down to earth. &nbsp;We can slow global warming and reduce the likelihood of extreme weather like Katrina. &nbsp;And we can wean ourselves from Middle East oil and avoid the next oil war.&#8221;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&#8220;This is a long-term problem,&#8221; said Collina. &nbsp;&#8220;Educating our students and young people on how to cut oil use is the long-term solution.&#8221;<BR>
