<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>The attempt by Delphi Corp. to use the bankruptcy process to slash wages and benefits for workers and then award company stock and nearly $90 million in cash bonuses to managers and executives is obscene. It is an insult to the 33,650 Delphi workers from six AFL-CIO unions who made this company the world’s biggest auto parts manufacturer. It is a threat not only to the wages, benefits and job security of every industrial worker in America, but to the company’s shareholders, suppliers and customers. The AFL-CIO stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Delphi workers and their unions. Not only can they count on the 5.5 million active and retired members of the six unions that formed the Mobilizing@Delphi coalition, they can count on the support of the entire 9 million member AFL-CIO. Together we will fight to force Delphi management to change the company’s anti-working family strategy.
