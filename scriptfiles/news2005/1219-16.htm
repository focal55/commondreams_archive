<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - December 19 - "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance ... may be conducted."[<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/18usc2511.htm">FISA; 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(f)</a>]<br />

The following analysts are available for a limited number of interviews:<br />
<br />
<b><a href="mailto:cpyle@mtholyoke.edu">CHRISTOPHER H. PYLE</a></b><br />

In 1970, Pyle disclosed the U.S. military's surveillance of civilian politics and worked as a consultant to three Congressional committees, including the Church Committee -- which wrote the FISA statute. He is co-author of the book <i>The President, Congress, and the Constitution</i> and author of the book <i>Military Surveillance of Civilian Politics</i>.<br />
<br />
Pyle said today: "Bush is asserting an inherent war power to violate the Fourth Amendment. Senator [Frank] Church's committee sought to end warrantless electronic surveillance. The method laid out in FISA is the only method. They made it very easy to get these wiretaps by creating a special court. Bush has violated that Act and the Act has a criminal statute associated with it. Anyone who violates that act is guilty of a felony punishment by up to five years imprisonment." Pyle is currently a professor of politics at Mount Holyoke College.<br />
