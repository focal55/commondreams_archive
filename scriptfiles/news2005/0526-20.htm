<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON, May 26  -- International agency Oxfam helped more than one million people in the first three months after the tsunami and has raised more than $250 million to support its aid effort, which is the largest in the organization's history, according to the first quarterly report on its response being published today.</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oxfam began rescue and relief efforts immediately after the Dec. 26 tsunami, and currently supports rebuilding and rehabilitation efforts in seven tsunami-affected countries. The agency's assistance ranges from providing hygiene kits to survivors in the immediate aftermath of the disaster in Indonesia to supporting the reconstruction of homes in Sri Lanka and replacing the boats of Indian fishermen.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For once, the scale of the response reflects the scale of the disaster,&quot; said Jeremy Hobbs, executive director of Oxfam International. &quot;What we have been able to accomplish so far has only been possible thanks to the unprecedented generosity of ordinary people around the world,&quot;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The quarterly report also includes Oxfam's strategy for spending $250 million over the next five years.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our long-term reconstruction program aims to give people the chance of building something better than the poverty that existed before the tsunami,&quot; said Hobbs.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of March, Oxfam International had spent more than $26.6 million across India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Burma, Somalia, and Thailand. Almost 95 percent of Oxfam International's tsunami fund will be spent directly on Oxfam's humanitarian programs, which have saved thousands of lives and are already helping more than a million people fulfill their basic needs, get back to work, and rebuild their communities. This year, Oxfam plans to spend $80 million.</font></p><p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
