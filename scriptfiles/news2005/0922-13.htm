<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - I am writing with the
        sad news that Molly Yard,
        an indefatigable advocate
        for women’s rights,
        passed away last night
        in her sleep in Pittsburgh
        at the age of 93. Molly
        had suffered a major stroke
        in 1991, but kept working
        until the late 1990s at
        the Feminist Majority.
        Throughout her long life,
        Molly worked for women’s
        rights, civil rights, workers’ rights,
        and social justice. 
<p align="left">Molly served as the political
        director and a leader of
        the campaign to pass the
        Equal Rights Amendment
        for the National Organization
        for Women in the late 1970s
        and 1980s, and was the
        president of NOW from 1987
        until 1992. Yard led the
        March for Women’s
        Lives to keep abortion
        and birth control safe
        and legal in 1989. She
        was also active in Americans
        for Democratic Action (ADA)
        and the Democratic Party,
        leading George McGovern’s
        presidential campaign in
        Pennsylvania in 1972. One
        of her first jobs out of
        college was special assistant
        to Eleanor Roosevelt. </p>
<p align="left">She was a brilliant strategist
        and a tireless organizer
        for campaigns for social
        justice who could always
        rally the troops. She was
        a leader in winning equal
        representation for women
        within the Democratic Party
        on all levels. She worked
        for countless women’s
        candidacies and made sure
        that NOW and the Feminist
        Majority kept equal representation
        for women and the winning
        of elected office for women
        high on the agenda of the
        women’s movement. </p>
<p align="left">Her energy, commitment,
        and dedication were unmatched,
        and she would never get
        discouraged. She saw the
        women’s rights struggle
        as a process, and she was
        there for the long haul.
        She instilled her spirit
        for the fight for women’s
        rights in three generations
        of women.</p>
<p align="left">Among Molly’s many
        contributions to the women’s
        movement was helping to
        popularize the gender gap
        in voting and public opinion.
        She helped convince her
        brother-in-law, Lou Harris,
        the dean of pollsters in
        the early 1980s, to separate
        out his polls by gender,
        which at the time was not
        the norm. Harris’ polls
        on Reagan broken out by
        gender made it clear that
        the gender gap was real
        and has had a lasting impact
        on politics. </p>
<p align="left">Molly recognized
        the importance of Title
        IX, the landmark 1972 legislation
        prohibiting sex discrimination
        in federally funded educational
        programs. As NOW’s
        political director from
        1985 to 1987, and then
        as president of NOW, she
        helped lead the victorious
        fight to restore Title
        IX after the devastating
        1984 Supreme Court decision
        in the <em>Grove
        City</em> case.
        Molly was so dedicated
        to equal educational and
        sports opportunities for
        women and girls, that even
        after her stroke and her
        presidency of NOW, she
        led the Feminist Majority’s
        Task Force on Title IX
        to ensure it would never
        be gutted again. Time after
        time in the 1990s, she
        helped beat back attempts
        to weaken Title IX. </p>
<p align="left">Molly worked for women’s
        rights long after she suffered
        her stroke. She organized
        one of the largest delegations
        for the Feminist Expo in
        1996, and gave her last
        major speech at Feminist
        Expo 2000, inspiring seasoned
        feminist activists and
        young feminist leaders
        alike.</p>
<p align="left">Molly was nothing if not
        a dedicated fundraiser
        for the causes to which
        she dedicated her life.
        I remember speaking at
        an event during the Equal
        Rights Amendment campaign,
        asking attendees to consider
        making a contribution to
        defray the costs of the
        campaign. Out of the corner
        of my eye, I saw Molly
        barreling toward me. She
        took the mike from my hand
        and said that my ask was
        too soft. She asked everyone
        in that room to dig into
        their pockets a little
        deeper, and no one could
        say no to Molly.</p>
<p align="left">In Molly’s memory,
        I am establishing two new
        funds to continue the work
        Molly cared so passionately
        about. Molly was always
        a leader working to save
        Title IX and protect equal
        educational opportunities
        for women and girls. The
        <a href="https://feminist.org/donations/foundation/donate_titleix.asp">Molly Yard
        Title IX Fund</a>        will fight any attempt
        to weaken or gut Title
        IX. Please consider making
        a <a href="https://feminist.org/donations/foundation/donate_titleix.asp">tax-deductible contribution
        to the Molly Yard Title
        IX Fund.</a></p>
<p align="left">I am also establishing
        the <a href="https://feminist.org/donations/fund/equal_rep.asp">Molly Yard
        Equal Representation Fund</a> to continue Molly’s
        work to win equal representation
        for women in Congress and
        the state legislatures.
        Molly was committ<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ed</font> to
        increasing women’s
        political power, and she
        was a leader of the Feminist
        Majority’s successful
        Feminization of Power campaign
        to <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">inspire more women to run for </font>
        political office. If you
        would like to make a gift
        in her honor, please <a href="https://feminist.org/donations/fund/equal_rep.asp">click
        here</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Molly’s <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">indomitable spirit </font> touched
        so many of our lives. I
        invite you to share your
        remembrances of or tributes
        to Molly on my new blog,
        <a href="http://www.msmagazineblogs.com/smealreport/">The Smeal Report</a>. </p>
<p align="left">There will be a Washington,
        DC celebration of Molly
        Yard’s life in the
        coming weeks. The Feminist
        Majority, the National
        Organization for Women,
        Americans for Democratic
        Action, and the countless
        progressive groups with
        which Molly worked will
        participate. If you are
        in the area, I hope you
        will be able to join us.
