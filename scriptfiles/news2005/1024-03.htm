<p>WASHINGTON - Today, Ralph Nader sent the following letter to all members of the DC 
Council illustrating problems with the publicly-subsidized baseball 
stadium project and its location, and outlining oversight points and 
questions that must be addressed publicly by the Council in the interest 
of the taxpaying residents of the District of Columbia.
<p>-----

<p>The Honorable Linda W. Cropp<br>
Council of the District of Columbia
<p>Dear Ms. Cropp:

<p>Where is the DC Council oversight on this runaway stadium gravy train? 
The recent maneuver to introduce as "technical" three amendments to last 
year's rush-job stadium bill, and to block all other amendments, is the 
latest example of a Council which has fallen to its knees. As reported 
by the Washington Post on October 18, 2005 regarding the utilities tax 
amendment, "Wall Street wants a guarantee in the legislation that the 
utilities tax will bring in at least $12 million a year, enough to cover 
the ballpark debt service." This amendment is a substantive change and 
anything but technical.

<p>This latest obstruction aside, other aspects of the stadium project and 
its costs must be publicly addressed to ensure accountability if the DC 
Council has any desire to hold to the commitments and promises made when 
the deal was approved last December. From the beginning of this 
boondoggle, Major League Baseball has dictated terms for the stadium and 
the DC Council has failed to provide adequate oversight. Consequently, 
it's no surprise that the deal is changing to further maximize the 
profits of Major League Baseball, at the added expense to the District 
and its residents.

<p>Too few questions were asked and too few specific answers were provided 
during Council hearings on the stadium proposal last year. And under 
pressure from the salesmen -- in this case Major League Baseball, the DC 
Sports and Entertainment Commission (DCSEC) and Mayor Anthony Williams 
-- to immediately sign on the dotted line, the DC Council agreed to a 
bad deal for DC taxpayers. The stadium bill was hastily shoved through 
(passing with a slim 7-6 vote) as if the District had no elected city 
legislature to look out for its residents (69 percent of whom opposed 
public subsidies for a stadium). Like infomercial scams, stadium deals 
around the country are a great way for rip-off artists to prey on the 
powerless.

<p>The Council's reluctance in representing the peoples' best interests 
through project oversight, after subordinating DC resident's life 
necessities to the avarice of a private, for-profit, monopoly 
entertainment corporation is indefensible. Without ensuring 
accountability to the citizens of the District of Columbia, the Council 
is allowing the incompetent DCSEC and city planners who are in charge of 
the stadium project to do even more damage behind closed doors. This 
situation invites Major League Baseball freeloaders and wealthy, 
opportunistic developers to manipulate terms and further profit at the 
expense of the under-represented District taxpayers.

<p>The Council's committees generally responsible for oversight of the 
stadium project are chaired by members who unforgivably prioritized this 
corporate welfare development, against the will of the people, over 
investments in public education, public health, literacy, affordable 
housing and other long-suffering social services. Still, to sidestep 
accountability and avoid verifying costs for this continuously altered 
debacle is negligence and an insult to taxpaying residents.

<p>Members of the Council who are skeptical of -- or opposed to -- the 
stadium project must not wait for the submissive committee chairs to 
raise the stadium issue and get answers. That day may never come, or 
purposely come at a time too late to protect the city from further 
pillaging.

<p>In addition to answers regarding the stadium lease, the DC Council is 
responsible for oversight ensuring: (a) an extensive, accurate and 
accountable environmental analysis of the stadium site; (b) that 
promises regarding the stadium project are kept, including those 
involving the financing and lease, community benefits and fan amenities, 
public transportation, parking and other infrastructure, and that all 
contracts and documents -- including those for the lease -- are made 
public; (c) that land valuations for the preferred stadium site do not 
tie the value entirely to the existence of the stadium but to the entire 
massive redevelopment of the area; and (d) that the RFK Stadium site be 
seriously considered in the interest of obtaining the cost certainty 
that the current stadium site cannot provide.

<p>Following, are just a few of the oversight points and questions that 
must be addressed publicly by the DC Council in the interest of the 
taxpaying residents of the District of Columbia:

<p>1) When the Washington Redskins were attempting to site their new 
stadium next to RFK Stadium in 1993, the team's owner Jack Kent Cooke 
sought to handle the matter privately, hiring private entities that 
deemed the site to be environmentally sound. As part of this procedure, 
the District along with the National Park Service (NPS) initially agreed 
to conduct a brief environmental assessment of the proposed site. 
However, community concern prompted both parties to undertake a more 
in-depth analysis by the NPS and the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) in the form of an environmental impact statement. The new study 
yielded a finding of lead contamination at the site, apparently placed 
in the ground by the Army Corps of Engineers during dredging of the 
Anacostia River. Remediation of the contamination was estimated at $8 
million to $12 million.

<p>The current stadium process has even more need for extensive 
environmental analysis given its proximity to the waterfront and the 
varied uses of the land - including industrial uses - in its history, 
yet no such thorough analysis has been completed despite the precedent 
established during the Redskins' stadium process. The people in charge 
of getting the stadium built may not be giving proper weight to the need 
to adequately examine the Anacostia waterfront site for environmental 
issues, especially since each remediation impacts the cost cap 
associated with the site.

<p>The question isn't if an in-depth and, most importantly, independent 
environmental impact study needs to be conducted as it was in 1993; the 
evidence is overwhelming that it must occur with all speed. The question 
is: Will the Council put the well-being of the citizens and the 
environment above the wishes of those who are continuing to fast-track 
the stadium in order to meet arbitrary time-lines and avoid cost caps 
and other overruns?

<p>2) The DC Council needs to use its powers of oversight on the stadium to 
ensure that proposals that are completely contrary to the promises made 
by proponents of a subsidized stadium are disallowed. As reported by 
WTOP on September 29, 2005 the DCSEC is attempting to circumvent DC 
Council oversight on terms for the stadium lease. The Washington 
Examiner reported on October 14, 2005 that Major League Baseball is 
actually refusing to guarantee its stadium rent payments (an average of 
$6 million per year), the one and only revenue source promised that the 
team would have to provide every year they used the taxpayer-funded 
stadium. DCSEC Chairman Mark Touhey's attempt to keep private some 
contracts and documents pertaining to the stadium must be confronted 
head-on to ensure accountability on the final lease and stadium legislation.

<p>Questions must also be answered regarding the planned 60 percent cutback 
of the promised Navy Yard Metro expansion, under pressure to cut corners 
to secure a qualifying estimate for stadium project costs from the Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO). This would eliminate the Metro expansion needed 
to ensure adequate service to baseball fans and would lead to a 
transportation nightmare before and after games.

<p>On October 6, 2005 the Washington Times reported that the DCSEC is now 
demanding above-ground parking for the stadium because below-ground 
parking would threaten the cost and time-line of the project and thereby 
threaten the workability of the current site. To do this, the DCSEC is 
attempting to change existing zoning laws against the wishes of the 
Anacostia Waterfront Corp. (AWC). In addition, unnamed "city officials" 
who insist on below-ground parking, "are considering removing parking 
entirely from the cost of the stadium and paying for it separately, 
using tax-increment financing or other revenue streams." These issues 
demand scrutiny by the DC Council. All along, stadium project costs were 
all-inclusive, and parking was specifically designated as part of the 
project in every estimate.

<p>Likewise, questions must be answered as to why, after years of promises 
as to superior fan-amenities in a new stadium, as opposed to those at 
RFK, plans now are to appease only the wealthiest few fans while most 
fans would likely have no better, if not worse, fan amenities at the new 
stadium than at the present RFK stadium.

<p>As the Washington City Paper revealed in its October 7, 2005 cover 
story, Major League Baseball has prevailed over the DCSEC's objections 
for a double-decked layer of luxury suites that will boost construction 
costs. An extra level can be built, explained DCSEC CEO Allen Lew, 
because of "certain changes that they made that reduce certain costs." 
In addition, the DCSEC is now indulging Major League Baseball with a 
7,500 square-foot conference center and a 10,000 square-foot lounge for 
"Diamond Club" members, both of which were -- among other perks -- 
rejected in a February 28, 2005 memo from the DCSEC explaining that it 
"cannot agree to changes that would result in an increase in the project 
budget." Though the DCSEC again objected to the changes in a June 7 
letter to the Nationals, months after final costs for the ballpark had 
been estimated by District Chief Financial Officer Natwar Gandhi, the 
changes have been implemented nonetheless with no proof that the budget 
would not change accordingly.

<p>Such major changes warrant scrutiny over rising costs and what cuts (or 
additional changes) are being made to offset them. Thanks to the 
double-decked layer of luxury suites, fans are likely to have worse 
seats in the upper deck of the new stadium which would be 21 feet higher 
than those at RFK Stadium. And due to a reduction in the planned 
upper-deck seat widths for the new stadium, fans would be wedged into 
their 19-inch-wide seats as opposed to the seats at RFK which are 20-21 
inches wide. "Planning documents," according to the City Paper, even 
call for non-refrigerated drinking fountains in the new stadium's public 
concourses, with only suite and club-seat fans enjoying cold drinking 
fountain water. Why are the taxpayers of DC paying the bills for all of 
this fan discomfort in a new stadium that would accommodate 5,000 fewer 
of them than RFK? These consumer-related changes are completely contrary 
to years of fan-amenity promises made by proponents of a subsidized stadium.

<p>3) According to the September 25, 2005 Washington Post, the District's 
Director of Development Stephen Green said that "in making assessments, 
contractors hired by the District considered property values in other 
areas in the city because sale prices for the land around the stadium 
site had skyrocketed after the plans were unveiled. 'We looked at other 
locations where there was not as much speculation,' he said." Were this 
stadium being placed in an area that had no prospects for massive 
redevelopment without the stadium and would likely not see such 
development without the stadium, then the city's valuation approach 
would have been more legally justifiable and the results more legitimate.

<p>However, the values of the properties in question would continue rising 
even without the stadium being placed there. Abandoned warehouses and 
industrial facilities near the current site are being replaced by 
massive office, retail, and residential projects in development 
speculation sparked by factors other than the stadium, the site of which 
was in question [as was the chance of getting a team in DC] and wasn't 
even announced until late last year. The size and scope of the SE 
Federal Center project combined with the Navy Yard and the new 
Department of Transportation (DOT) headquarters have been the driving 
force for the extensive redevelopment that has been occurring and 
growing at the area surrounding the current stadium site before the 
stadium plan was announced.

<p>Contrary to the notion that the stadium can be held solely responsible 
for land valuation are the statements of officials from DC's Office of 
Planning that accompanied the site evaluation studies conducted in 2002. 
Andy Altman, former director of the Office of Planning, said in these 
presentations that the area would be redeveloped and economically 
transformed "whether a ballpark is there or not," and excerpts from the 
site evaluation study confirm this opinion. In light of Director Green's 
recent comments, the Council must secure new valuations that do not tie 
the value entirely to the existence of the stadium but to the entire 
massive redevelopment and transformation of the area surrounding the 
current stadium site.

<p>4) District CFO Natwar Gandhi developed an estimate for land 
acquisition, environmental remediation and infrastructure costs for the 
planned stadium site at the Anacostia waterfront well before accurate 
answers to those questions could be gathered. Because of the existing 
businesses and residences on the site in question, it was impossible to 
gauge if and when the city would be able to secure the properties -- and 
at what cost -- due to litigation concerning land values. It was also 
impossible to develop an accurate cost estimate for environmental 
remediation due to the extensive amount of analysis that would have to 
have been completed for this site with its proximity to the waterfront 
and its varied history of uses including industrial uses. The point of 
having a stadium estimate was to gauge if a stadium could be built at 
the site in time for the 2008 season at an acceptable cost level in 
keeping with the revenue projections for the stadium.

<p>However, recent reports make it clear that almost every phase of the 
stadium planning is still incomplete, including the design of the 
stadium. In addition, reports such as those in the July 17, 2005 
Washington Times suggest that "land acquisition issues, environmental 
remediation issues, political issues, [and] design issues" could cause 
the new stadium to not open until 2009 or even 2010. Most troubling is 
the report in the October 22, 2005 Washington Post stating that "the 
city is facing myriad issues with the remaining properties" and that 
"once the District begins eminent domain proceedings, the legal battles 
could drag on for months, even years, to determine how much the city 
will ultimately pay for the land."

<p>Given the promises of further lawsuits from landowners at the proposed 
site [Washington Post, September 25 and October 22, 2005] and the 
uncertainty that additional design issues and potential environmental 
issues present, no city official from the CFO to the head of the DCSEC 
[especially with its history of overspending and overruns] can verify 
the current cost estimate for the stadium, making the CFO's estimate 
meaningless as a gauge for assessing the workability of the site.

<p>In the interest of obtaining the cost certainty that the current site 
cannot provide, the DC Council must seriously consider the RFK Stadium 
site, where most of the challenges facing the current site have been 
addressed or do not exist and the temptation to cater to cost and time 
constraints is greatly alleviated.

<p>As reported in the Washington Post on October 15, 2005: "The bidding 
groups have been informally polled by baseball officials about their 
willingness to buy the team if a stadium is built near RFK Stadium, 
rather than near South Capitol Street and the Navy Yard along the 
Anacostia River, according to sources familiar with the process who 
asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the 
negotiations." Two (unnamed) potential ownership groups contacted by the 
Post "said they would still offer to pay $450 million for the team if 
the ballpark is constructed on another site."

<p>The significance of Major League Baseball treating the Council's 
possible selection of the RFK site as a potential reality cannot be 
overemphasized. Despite the tough front put up by Baseball officials, 
this indication that the sale price for the Nationals would be 
unaffected if the RFK site is chosen should put to rest any worries that 
a change in the stadium site would be a deal-breaker for Major League 
Baseball. This evidence, added to the growing problems and costs at the 
current site, should make a site relocation the only viable option.

<p>Furthermore, any concerns by the Council that a change in site for the 
stadium would adversely affect developers in the area near the current 
site should be eased. On October 16, 2005 the Washington Post reported 
that "Rockville-based developer Ron Cohen, who recently paid $51 million 
for a city block at Half and K streets SE, a few blocks north of the 
stadium site, said he didn't think developers would be harmed if the 
site changed. 'The area has come into its own,' he said. 'Baseball gives 
it some identity, but with the Navy Yard down there, the [U.S. 
Department of Transportation], all the other office buildings along M 
Street and the waterfront redevelopment, they're not feeding off of the 
stadium. They're feeding off of commerce.'"

<p>Instead, the Council should be concerned for the existing property 
owners of the current stadium site who stand to have their land taken 
from them by eminent domain. Such careless and needless disregard for 
the welfare of these people by the District government could be 
prevented by choosing the RFK site. It is an alternative that would also 
reduce costs to taxpayers, improve the timeline of the stadium project, 
offer public transit capable of handling game crowds, include known 
remediation cost, and even provide development opportunities.

<p>If the DC Council cannot now find the motivation to publicly address the 
stadium project and its costs through oversight to ensure 
accountability, then shame on its members. The District can not benefit 
while its residents are taken advantage of in favor of autocratic 
corporate welfarists. This issue is not going to go away.

<p>I look forward to your considered response, and to thorough DC Council 
oversight hearings on the stadium issue which are long overdue. You have 
always said you want the facts.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Ralph Nader<br>
Washington, DC
