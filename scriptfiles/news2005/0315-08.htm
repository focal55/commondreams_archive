<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 15 -- Following is a statement of Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer at a press conference held by the Congressional Ethics Coalition to urge House leaders to resolve the unprecedented ethics crisis:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Congressional Ethics Coalition has been warning for months that we were headed for a train wreck in the House on ethics matters. That train wreck has arrived in the form of a complete breakdown of the House Ethics Committee and ethics process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The absence of a functioning Ethics Committee and the collapse of the ethics enforcement process in the House are untenable, unacceptable and irresponsible. This can only serve to seriously undermine the integrity and credibility of the Members of the House, and the House as an institution, in the eyes of the American people.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The absence of an operational House Ethics Committee is an extraordinary development in the modern history of the House and must be resolved immediately.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;House Speaker Dennis Hastert has the authority and the responsibility to deal with the House ethics crisis and must do so quickly.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The ethics breakdown in the House is the direct result of rules changes and other actions initiated at the beginning of this Congress by the House Republican leadership.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;These actions have crippled the House ethics enforcement process and created the widespread public view that Republican Members and Committee staff were removed from their Ethics Committee positions simply for doing their jobs and holding House Majority Leader Tom DeLay accountable last year for his multiple ethics improprieties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;These actions clearly had the goal of curbing and curtailing the ethics enforcement process in the House and they have done so &#150;- effectively leading to a shut down of the ethics process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;All of this is occurring at a time when there are at least eight ethics matters that need to be placed on the agenda of a functioning House Ethics Committee. Three of these matters involve, at least in part, House Majority Leader DeLay. A list of the eight ethics matters is provided.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Representative Alan Mollohan, the Ranking Democratic Member of the House Ethics Committee, has introduced H. Res. 131, a proposal to repeal the rules changes adopted at the beginning of this Congress that have caused the breakdown of the House ethics enforcement process. While it will by no means solve all of the ethics enforcement problems that exist in the House, the Mollohan proposal represents a necessary first step in restoring a functioning House Ethics Committee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We strongly urge Speaker Hastert and all House Members to support the Mollohan resolution.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We also strongly urge Speaker Hastert to schedule the Mollohan resolution for an immediate vote. If the Speaker refuses to allow a vote on this resolution, then we call on Republican House Members to join with House Democrats in signing a discharge petition to bring the Mollohan resolution directly and quickly to the floor for a vote.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;House members also need to support additional strengthening measures necessary to ensure a publicly credible House ethics process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;At a time when serious ethics questions are being raised in other sectors of our society, Members of Congress have a duty and responsibility to set the highest ethics standards for the citizens they represent.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The elimination of ethics oversight and enforcement in the House means for all practical purposes the elimination of the House ethics rules. This cannot be allowed to stand.&#148;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
