<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->QUANG TRI, Vietnam - August 24 - Nguyen Duy Khanh, a father of five
children was killed by a US-Vietnam War era shell on August 23rd, 2005
in Gio Linh district of Quang Tri province, Vietnam. <br>
<br>
The 52 year old man was farming when struck an unidentified piece of
ordnace with his hoe. The force of the blast was felt by his son not
too far away who rushed to his aid and brought him to the hospital.<br>
Khanh died soon after. He is suvived by his wife and five dependent
children,&nbsp; the youngest of which is still in the 6th grade.<br>
<br>
Although the Vietnam War ended 30 years ago, by some estimates over
350,000 tons of bombs that did not detonate when dropped remain in the
ground. This ordnance regularly claims lives and limbs in this still
war-ravaged province. Since the conflict ended in 1975, nearly 40,000
Vietnamese have been killed by by these munitions.<br>
<br>
