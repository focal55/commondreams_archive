<p>WASHINGTON - October 21- Rep. Waxman, joined by twelve members of Congress, today released <a href="http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov/Documents/20051021122225-53143.pdf" target="_new">a new GAO report</a> (.pdf file) that found security and reliability flaws in the electronic voting process. Rep. Waxman also released <a href="http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov/Documents/20051021120405-06621.pdf" target="_new">a fact sheet</a> (.pdf file) summarizing the report's key findings.  Both the report and factsheet are available online at <a href="http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov" target="_new">www.democrats.reform.house.gov</a>

<p>Rep. Waxman said, "The GAO report indicates that we need to get serious and act quickly to improve the security of electronic voting machines. The report makes clear that there is a lack of transparency and accountability in electronic voting systems -- from the day that contracts are signed with manufacturers to the counting of electronic votes on Election Day. State and local officials are spending a great deal of money on machines without concrete proof that they are secure and reliable." 

<p>The GAO report found flaws in security, access, and hardware controls, as well as weak security management practices by voting machine vendors. The report identified multiple examples of actual operational failures in real elections and found that while national initiatives to improve the security and reliability of electronic voting systems are underway, "it is unclear when these initiatives will be available to assist state and local election authorities." 

<p>The Help America Vote Act of 2002 increased the federal role in state and local elections, in part by giving states the resources to improve the accessibility, security, and reliability of their voting systems. Under HAVA, nearly $39 billion has been allocated to states to purchase electronic voting systems and improve the voting process.
