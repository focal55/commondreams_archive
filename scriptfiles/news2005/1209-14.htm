<p>WASHINGTON - December 9 - Tomorrow, December 10th,  ONE: The Campaign to Make Poverty History will be joined in the  fight against global AIDS and extreme poverty by the states of  Iowa, Connecticut and Maine, and cities across the country from Gary,  Indiana to Chattanooga, Tennessee, while Illinois will become the  first state to introduce a &quot;State of ONE&quot; joint resolution in  their Legislature.</p>
<p>   &quot;In the past year, more than 3.1 million people worldwide died  from AIDS, and 570,000 were children,&quot; said Lt. Governor of  Illinois Pat Quinn.  &quot;While these statistics are staggering, we  have a historic opportunity to come together as a state, country  and world to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. We can defeat AIDS and  extreme poverty, and we're asking every state to join with us to  help an entire generation of people in the world's poorest  countries.&quot;</p>
<p>   Cities of ONE and States of ONE have joined the growing list  of individuals and communities committed to ONE's campaign to  fight the emergency of global AIDS and extreme poverty.</p>
<p>   &quot;Today, more than 1 billion people live on less than $1 a day  and 300 million of them live in Africa,&quot; said Mayor Tom Potter of  Portland, Oregon.  &quot;We live in a big country, with a big heart.   From our city of Portland, Oregon all the way to Portland, Maine,  Americans are working together across the country to make a  difference in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty around  the world.&quot;</p>
<p>   States of ONE include: Iowa, Connecticut, Maine and Illinois.  Cities  of ONE include: Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA; Cambridge, MA  ;Chattanooga, TN; Cleveland, OH; Columbus, OH; DeKalb, IL; Elgin,  IL; Evansville, IN; Farmington Hills, MI; Frankfort, KY;  Ft.Wayne, IN; Gary, IN; Green Bay, WI; Greenville, SC; Hartford,  CT; Hollywood, FL; Indianapolis, IN; Jackson, TN; Johnson City,  TN; Knoxville, TN; Lexington, KY; Madison, WI; Muncie, IN;  Nashville, TN; New Haven, CT; Portland, ME; Portland, OR;  Providence, RI; Redlands, CA; Richmond, IN; Salt Lake City, UT;  San Francisco, CA; Sarasota, FL; Seattle, WA; Virginia Beach, VA;  Wooster, OH.</p>
<p>   As people around the world gather to mark White Band Day,  leaders from around the world will also be gathering in Hong Kong  to consider changing international rules to make trade fair.   Saturday will be the final ONE &quot;White Band Day&quot; of 2005, one of  three days this year when people from America to Zambia raise  their voices as ONE and ask leaders to do more to save millions  of lives in the poorest countries.  Worn by teachers, doctors,  students, pastors, homemakers and even celebrities, over 2  million Americans are now wearing the white band in support of  the ONE Campaign.  </p>
<p>   Statements by Cities and States in support of the ONE  Campaign:</p>
<p>   Chattanooga, TN, Mayor Ron Littlefield: &quot;Cities are places of  civilization and culture.  Unfortunately, they can also be places  of great struggle and suffering.   Poverty and the chronic health  challenge of AIDS are holding us back.  All cities great and  small can make a difference.  Chattanooga is doing its part and  we encourage others to join us.&quot;</p>
<p>   Cleveland, OH, Mayor Jane L. Campbell: &quot;The City of Cleveland  shares in the desire to make a difference. I am in full support  of the ONE Campaign's efforts to bring awareness to these two  ever-growing global situations.&quot;</p>
<p>   Columbus, OH, Mayor Michael B. Coleman: &quot;Poverty and disease,  whether in our neighborhoods or around the globe, diminish our  quality of life and the vibrancy of our future.  While we build  our City into the 21st Century, we must be vocal and vigilant in  defending all those who cannot defend themselves and serving all  those who are in need.  We are proud to be counted as a City of  One, and to stand united in our belief that we can make a  difference.&quot;</p>
<p>   Hartford, CT, Mayor Eddie Perez: &quot;In my State of the City  Address, I noted how we must be 'One Hartford'--- where all  residents can feel that they are a part of the renaissance of our  great city.  By adding that Hartford is now a 'City of ONE, we  are connected to the worldwide effort of improving the quality of  life for our global neighbors as well.&quot;</p>
<p>   Illinois State Rep. John Fritchey: Historically, the greatest  of struggles have been overcome when individuals come together in  order to eliminate an injustice, be it social, moral or medical.  By making Illinois one of the first states is the country to join  forces with the ONE Campaign in the global fight against HIV/AIDS  and extreme poverty, we are signaling to the rest of the country  that our state, its government and its people, are fully  committed to eradicating this pandemic.  It is unacceptable to  simply stand by while HIV/AIDS kills - in Africa alone - 6,600  people per day.&quot;</p>
<p>   Indianapolis, IN, Mayor Bart Peterson: &quot;History shows us that  big changes can start with small actions,&quot; said Indianapolis  Mayor Bart Peterson.  Today, Indianapolis is taking a new step  toward relieving worldwide poverty because we know that by  working with others as a part of the ONE campaign, we can do more  to save lives.  We can feed and educate so many more in the  world's poorest countries.&quot;</p>
<p>   Lexington, KY, Mayor Teresa Ann Isaac:  &quot;Far too many people  are still living at extreme levels of poverty. The ONE Campaign  is an effort we can all support and be proud of because America  is in the best position to eradicate poverty and make a serious  commitment to finding a cure and treating those who are victims  of the AIDS pandemic.&quot;</p>
<p>   Portland, OR, Mayor Tom Potter: &quot;Today, more than 1 billion  people live on less than $1 a day and 300 million of them live in  Africa. We live in a big country, with a big heart.  From our  city of Portland, Oregon all the way to Portland, Maine,  Americans are working together across the country to make a  difference in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty around  the world.&quot;</p>
<p>   Seattle, WA, Mayor Greg Nickels: &quot;Seattle has long been at the  forefront of helping meet the needs of those affected by poverty  and injustice whether in our city, our country or halfway around  the world. In a spirit of humanitarian commitment, we are proud  to recognize ONE and declare Seattle as the first city in America  uniting our citizens to join this historic movement.&quot;</p>
