<p>NEW YORK - November 17 - Los Angeles Times columnist Robert Scheer was fired on November 11 after nearly 30 years
at the paper, the last 13 as one of its most progressive political
columnists. <br>
<br>

In a published statement announcing op-ed page changes (11/10/05), the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span>
insisted that it is dedicated to "provid[ing] readers with a wide range
of voices and perspectives," but in dumping Scheer, the paper has
gotten rid of one of the few prominent progressive columnists in the
country. <br>
<br>

Scheer's forceful and independent commentary has often placed him in
the middle of national debates. He has been one of the strongest
critics of the White House over the Iraq War. For instance, in a
pre-war column (8/6/02) that undercuts the current notion that everyone
got the WMD story wrong, Scheer wrote that “a consensus of experts”
told the Senate that Iraq’s chemical and biological arsenals were
“almost totally destroyed during eight years of inspections.” Shortly
after George W. Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” speech, and well ahead of
the pack, Scheer (6/3/03) called White House pretexts for war a “big
lie.” <br>
<br>

Scheer was also one of the first columnists to call for withdrawal from
Iraq, in a November 4, 2003 column that presaged shifting public
opinion on the issue--though his position is still hard to find among
his fellow pundits. More than 1,700 U.S. soldiers and tens of thousands
of Iraqis have died since Scheer’s call for withdrawal was published. <br>
<br>

In 1999, with a Democrat in the White House, Scheer used his column to
expose the racism and unfairness driving the government's (and media's)
case against Wen Ho Lee, a Chinese-American scientist wrongly accused
of spying. And when a federal court struck the words “under God” from
the Pledge of Allegiance in 2002, Scheer was one of the rare media
figures who bucked the Republican/Democratic consensus by strongly
defending the court's decision (See <span class="media_outlet">Extra! Update</span>, 8/02.) <br>
<br>

The <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> has suggested that
Scheer's firing was simply part of a larger revamping of its opinion
pages, but Scheer says he was fired for ideological reasons and because
the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span>' corporate parent, <span class="media_outlet">Tribune Company</span> of Chicago, was caving in to outside pressure from conservatives. As Scheer told <span class="media_outlet">Democracy Now</span>!
(11/14/05), "What happened is that I had been the subject of vicious
attacks by Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh…. I was a punching bag for
those guys. I'm still standing, and the people who run the paper
collapsed."<br>
<br>

In the same appearance, Scheer also blamed <span class="media_outlet">Times</span>
publisher Jeff Johnson: "The big issue here, I think, is that the
publisher took over the editorial pages, a guy named Jeff Johnson. He's
an accountant from Chicago, doesn't know anything about what newspapers
are supposed to be about, and he made a decision to get rid of the
column."<br>
<br>

In an email to supporters on the day he was fired, Scheer suggested
that Johnson disliked his views: "The publisher Jeff Johnson, who has
offered not a word of explanation to me, has privately told people that
he hated every word that I wrote. I assume that mostly refers to my
exposing the lies used by President Bush to justify the invasion of
Iraq."<br>
<br>

Whether or not ideology was behind Scheer’s dismissal, the timing is
peculiar. The action removed one of the strongest critics of the Iraq
War in a week when the White House lashed out at detractors, following
months of public opinion drawing closer to the views of critics like
Scheer. <br>
<br>

It’s not as if the <span class="media_outlet">Los Angeles Times</span> has a surplus of progressive columnists. Of the ten columnists in the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span>’ new line-up, three are conservative movement favorites--<span class="media_outlet">National Review Online</span>'s Jonah Goldberg will soon join the <span class="media_outlet">Weekly Standard</span>'s
Max Boot and the Hoover Institution's Niall Ferguson--and two are
relatively less known progressives, Rosa Brooks and Erin Aubrey Kaplan.
While the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> should be applauded
for bringing new diversity to its op-ed page by hiring the two
progressive women—Brooks, a law professor, was hired last June and
Kaplan, an African-American writer formerly at LA Weekly, was added in
the recent shake-up--it's puzzling that the paper would fire its most
prominent progressive columnist at such a crucial time. <br>
