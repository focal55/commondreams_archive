<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Veterans, military families and members of MoveOn.org Political Action will hand deliver more than 400,000 petition signatures to 244 district offices of members of Congress on Wednesday urging support for  a timeline that would bring U.S. troops home from Iraq by the end of 2006.  This action is part of a campaign that will intensify in coming months.

 

<p>“It is irresponsible to our troops and to the Iraqi people for members of Congress to defend the President and his failed policy in Iraq,” said Tom Matzzie, Washington Director of MoveOn.org Political Action. “That’s why more than 400,000 people signed petitions to urge them to support an exit plan with a timeline that brings our troops home by the end of 2006."

 

<p>According to recent polls, a majority of Americans want the President and Republicans in Congress to provide an exit strategy from Iraq with a timeline. Last month in Cairo, representatives of all Iraqi political factions also called for the United States to produce a timetable for withdrawal.

 

<p>Matzzie observed that military experts such as Representative John P. Murtha (D-PA), ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Defense, and Reagan-era National Security Director Lt. General William Odom, as well as international terrorism expert University of Chicago political scientist Robert A. Pape maintain that stability in Iraq is impossible as long as U.S. troops are present thereby fueling the insurgency.

 

<p>Below are some key targets of MoveOn’s petition drive. All of these representatives have failed to support an exit plan.
