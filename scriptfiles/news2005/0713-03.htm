<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 13 -   Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, expressed concern about reports today that the Bush Administration has actively sought the advice of radical right leader Jerry Falwell on whom to nominate for vacancy on the Supreme Court, stripping the White House of any credibility in searching for a consensus candidate who can unify the country.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a story published in today&#146;s New York Times, Falwell &#151; who enraged Americans after the September 11, 2001 attacks by saying that we could expect more attacks if &quot;God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve&quot; &#151; confirmed that the White House reached out to him to seek his advice on a Supreme Court nominee. The paper reported that Falwell &quot;declined to offer advice, telling the White House staff member that, because of Mr. Bush's track record appointing conservative judges, `&quot;I am willing to sit back and trust him and pray for him.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We&#146;re glad that President Bush is reaching out for advice, but this isn&#146;t the direction we had in mind,&quot; said Keenan. &quot;Consulting with Jerry Falwell is not a recipe for bringing America together. Even more troubling is the assurance Falwell has apparently been given that any nominee would meet his litmus test of opposing personal freedoms like the right to privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose. Any nominee who can earn Jerry Falwell&#146;s trust is someone who&#146;ll likely be hard for mainstream America to swallow.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keenan added &quot;When Americans read the vicious words that came from Jerry Falwell in the wake of our worst tragedy ever, they saw his true colors. That the President would seek the counsel of such a person is unconscionable.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
