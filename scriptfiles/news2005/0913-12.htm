JEREMY SCAHILL</a></b><br />
Currently in Louisiana, Scahill is author of the recent article "Overkill: Feared Blackwater Mercenaries Deploy in New Orleans." The piece notes: "Heavily armed paramilitary mercenaries from the Blackwater private security firm, infamous for their work in Iraq, are openly patrolling the streets of New Orleans. ... They say they are on contract with the Department of Homeland Security and have been given the authority to use lethal force."<br />

Laffin is with the Dorothy Day Catholic Worker in Washington, D.C. He said today: "The Air Force Association is holding its annual Air & Space Convention and Technology Expo -- 'Arms Bazaar' -- at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel [in D.C.]. Its motto is 'The Force Behind the Force.' One hundred top military contractors are peddling their newest weaponry and technology to Pentagon officials and agents from other nations. ... These  weapons fuel the over 30 wars raging around the world today." The Catholic Worker is holding a vigil across from the hotel from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday.<br />

Burroughs, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee on Nuclear Policy, is participating in a news conference at UN Plaza on Tuesday with other nongovernmental organizations just ahead of the UN World Summit. He said today: "Ambassador John Bolton is undermining non-proliferation and disarmament at the upcoming Summit." Burroughs added that the administration's statements related to non-proliferation "reflect a stunning hypocrisy as the Pentagon prepares to finalize a new document, the Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations. Carrying forward with the 2002 Nuclear Posture Review, the doctrine envisages 'preemptive' U.S. use of nuclear weapons against countries 'intending to use' weapons of mass destruction."<br />
