<p>LONDON - A criminal trail of illegally logged timber 
from the world's last rainforests, which is 'laundered' in China before 
arriving in Europe, the USA and other consumer countries, has been 
uncovered by a major Greenpeace investigation. (1)

<p>Shortly after 7.30am this morning, Greenpeace activists blockaded 
government offices in London in protest. The activists dumped over a 
tonne of plywood secured with large chains over the entrance to DEFRA, 
the UK Government's department responsible for the environment. Two 
activists chained themselves to the plywood to prevent it being removed, 
and climbers scaled the outside of the building and secured a banner 
reading 'Ban Illegal Timber'.

<p>"Governments around the world have known about this problem for years 
and they've done absolutely nothing about it. Illegally logged timber 
products from the world's last rainforests are sold openly around the 
world. This criminal trade must be prohibited immediately," said Phil 
Aikman, Greenpeace International forests campaigner.

<p>Greenpeace has found that timber from the rainforests of Papua New 
Guinea, Indonesia and Gabon is routinely logged illegally, shipped to 
China and transformed into plywood before being exported around the 
world. Many of the companies that log the tropical timber are known to 
be involved in criminal activities. In Papua New Guinea, for example, 
the logging industry is dominated by Malaysian logging giant Rimbunan 
Hijau, a company that has been directly linked not only to environmental 
destruction, but also to human rights abuses including torture and rape. (2) "China is by far the largest importer of rainforest destruction in the 
world," said Aikman. "For every ten tropical logs shipped from the 
world's threatened rainforests, five are destined for China."

<p>A new report, Partners in Crime, published by Greenpeace UK, explains 
the 14,000 mile journey taken by illegally logged timber from Papua New 
Guinea, home to animals and plants found nowhere else on the planet. 
This timber was traced back to UK ports, building sites and builders' 
merchants via the processing mills of China, where it is transformed 
into plywood and then exported to markets around the world. US owned 
'Wolseley', the world's largest heating and plumbing company, is one of 
those identified selling such products in the UK.

<p>Illegally logged rainforest timber was found at Chinese plywood mills 
destined for several other European destinations. Rainforest timber from 
Gabon, home to some of Africa's last great apes, was found marked for 
export to the USA.
 
<p>Greenpeace is calling on governments to introduce legislation to ban the 
import of illegal timber and to support sustainable forest management 
globally. (3)

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization, which uses 
non-violent, creative communication tools to put the spotlight on global 
environmental problems, and to drive towards solutions essential for a 
green and peaceful future.
