<p align="left">WASHINGTON - September 29 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State expressed disappointment in the Senate&#8217;s confirmation of John G. Roberts, Jr., to be the 17th chief justice of the United States.
<P>Voting 78 to 22, the Senate today confirmed Roberts&#8217; nomination. </P>
<P>Americans United had urged senators to defeat the nomination, citing Roberts&#8217; hostile record toward the First Amendment principle of church-state separation. </P>
<P>&#8220;We fear that Roberts will move the high court in a direction that will prove detrimental to religious liberty in this country,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#8220;His record during the Reagan and first Bush administrations showed him to be a consistent advocate for a radical lowering of the church-state wall.&#8221;</P>
<P>In late August, Americans United issued a report, &#8220;Religious Minorities At Risk,&#8221; showing that throughout his political and legal career Roberts has opposed Supreme Court decisions upholding church-state separation and freedom of conscience for all Americans. For example, the report noted that as principal deputy solicitor general in the first Bush administration, Roberts co-authored a brief in a 1992 school prayer case asking the high court to scrap an important decades-old test the federal courts have used to decide church-state cases.</P>
<P>During his hearings in early September Roberts said little to assuage Americans United&#8217;s concerns. </P>
<P>&nbsp;But during an exchange with Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) on Sept. 13, Roberts did suggest that he believes the First Amendment&#8217;s religious liberty clauses were meant to protect all Americans.</P>
<P>&#8220;I think the animating principle of the framers, that&#8217;s reflected in both of the religion clauses, is that no one should be denied the rights of full citizenship because of their religious belief or their lack of religious belief,&#8221; Roberts said. </P>
<P>Lynn said he hoped Roberts would live up to that viewpoint in his new capacity as chief justice.</P>
<P>&#8220;I hope John Roberts sincerely meant those words and that his decisions on the high court will reflect that sentiment,&#8221; Lynn said.</P>
<P id=aboutau>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</P>
