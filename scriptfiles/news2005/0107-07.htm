<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 7 --  A person who sent e-mails criticizing a Texas politician for helping to cause a budget deficit and make wasteful expenditures has a right to remain anonymous, a judge ruled today. The Internet critic, known only as recall_carl01, sent a series of e-mails in February and March 2004 identifying wasteful expenditures and urging fellow citizens to keep those in mind when voting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Jefferson County Commissioner Jimmy Cokinos, who lost his re-election bid in March, filed a petition in June in the District Court of Jefferson County. He claimed that several of the e-mails were defamatory and demanded that the court order recall_carl01 to be identified.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen, which has been a strong defender of First Amendment rights on the Internet, urged the court to allow recall_carl01 to remain anonymous. By seeking re-election, Cokinos voluntarily made his conduct a fair subject for comment, argued Paul Alan Levy, a Public Citizen attorney representing recall_carl01. Further, courts have ruled that subpoenas to reveal the names of anonymous speakers can chill free speech, and those courts have upheld the right to communicate anonymously over the Internet.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, District Court Judge Gary Sanderson agreed, ruling that a subpoena that would identify recall_carl01 should be quashed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The e-mails at issue here contained standard criticism of the use of taxpayer money &#150; not defamatory statements &#150; and it was well within recall_carl01&#146;s right to make the comments,&#148; Levy said. &#147;We are very gratified that the judge agreed that this Internet critic has a First Amendment right to speak anonymously on the Internet.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richard Aman of Houston, Texas and staff counsel of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas served as local counsel.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
