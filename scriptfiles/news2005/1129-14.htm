<p>WASHINGTON - November 29 - After weeks of speculation, the Vatican formally released a document Tuesday calling on the restriction of gays in the priesthood. The document outlines that gay men with “deep-seated homosexual tendencies” or those who support gay culture should be barred from entering the seminary. The document was released three years after a sex abuse scandal rocked the Catholic Church.

<p>“This is a scapegoat scheme masquerading as Vatican decree,” said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. “What is being released today is a decree serving as a diversion that neither keeps children safe nor holds criminals responsible.”

<p>Yesterday, on the eve of the official release, the Human Rights Campaign sent out a nationwide call to action to all fair-minded Catholics to speak directly to the priests in local parishes throughout the country.

<p>The call to action stated: “We are calling on all Catholics of goodwill to speak to their priests and express their deep concern at this decision,” said Harry Knox, director of the Human Rights Campaign’s Religion and Faith Program. “We’re speaking directly to Catholics in the pews and urging them to consider what Jesus would do if he saw his neighbor treated this way.”

<p><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
