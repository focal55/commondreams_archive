<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 20 -- On the occasion of his inauguration as President of the United States of America, Amnesty International has appealed to President Bush to make the eradication of torture and ill-treatment by US agents, and the USA&#146;s full compliance with international law and standards for the treatment and trial of detainees, a hallmark of his second term in office.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its appeal, Amnesty International sets out how the USA&#146;s detention and interrogation policies in the &quot;war on terror&quot; have flouted hard-won principles of human rights. Individual detainees and their families have suffered, the rule of law has suffered, and the reputation of the USA has suffered. The USA&#146;s policy and practice have set a bad example to those governments looking for justification to employ their own repressive conduct.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a full copy of the appeal sent to President Bush, please see: <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR510122005" target="_new">http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR510122005</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
