<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 17 -- As the U.S. Senate once again takes up consideration of national energy policy, it must do more than merely produce legislation that is better than the bills approved by U.S. House of Representatives which - overall - have grown progressively worse for sustainable energy technologies.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, the Senate should seize this once-in-a-decade opportunity and craft an energy bill to accomplish three primary goals:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">substantially reducing the level of energy imports;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> slashing the emission of greenhouse gases; and</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> making the transition from polluting energy sources like nuclear power and fossil fuels, which threaten national security and the environment, towards domestically-available renewable energy resources, energy efficient technologies, and a sustainable hydrogen economy.</font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To realize those goals, national energy legislation should incorporate strong renewable energy and energy efficiency provisions including the following:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> a national renewable portfolio standard (e.g., 20% by 2020);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a national renewable fuels standard (e.g., 20% by 2020);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> a long-term (i.e., 5+ years) production tax credit that benefits the cross-section of commercially available and emerging renewable energy technologies and provides comparable financial incentives for tax-exempt entities such as municipal utilities;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a package of renewable energy investment tax credits benefitting the mix of domstically-available renewable energy technologies;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">national standards for net metering and interconnection to facilitate the development of distributed renewable energy technologies and enhanced transmission and distribution grid reliability;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> budget authority for federal agencies to increase aggressively their </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">purchase of electricity generated from domestically available renewable energy sources;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">authorization levels for federal renewable energy and energy efficiency program budgets that are at least twice as high as current levels;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">improved CAFE standards that require fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and trucks to be improved by no less than 50% over the next decade and doubled within two decades;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> substantially improved efficiency standards for lighting, appliances, utilities, and industrial motors;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> tax incentives to promote efficiency improvements in new and exisiting buildings and to encourage the purchase of energy-efficient appliances, automobiles, and heavy-duty vehicles;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> permanent authority for federal agencies to enter into Energy Service Performance Contracts without restrictions of any kind to facilitate efficiency upgrades in government buildings; and</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> provisions for reducing the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including - but not limited to - a cap-and-trade system, enhanced incentives for voluntary programs, formal designation of CO2 as a pollutant subject to EPA regulation, and expanded funding for research amd implementation of GHG control technologies.</font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National energy legislation should not include new federal expenditures, tax subsidies, or policy initiatives designed to facilitate:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> construction of new nuclear power plants;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">siting and building of Liquified Natural Gas facilities, particularly in communities opposing them, which will facilitate greater dependence on energy imports;</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> drilling for, or mining of, fossil fuels in environmentally sensitive areas; or</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> roll-backs of existing environmental and consumer protections.</font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Failure to pursue and enact energy legislation that embraces these principles will only assure a worsening of the energy problems now facing the United States, delay the transition to a sustainable energy economy, and ensure that the Congress will have to continue to revisit this issue over and over again in the future until it gets it right.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALLIANCE FOR AFFORDABLE ENERGY ** AMERICAN SOLAR ENERGY SOCIETY ** ENERGY INNOVATIONS ** GREENPEACE USA ** MINNESOTANS FOR AN ENERGY-EFFICIENCY ECONOMY ** NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL TRUST ** NEW USES COUNCIL ** THE STELLA GROUP LTD. ** SUN DAY CAMPAIGN ** SUSTAINABLEBUSINESS.COM ** THE VOTE SOLAR INITIATIVE ** VERMONT ENERGY INVESTMENT CORPORATION</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
