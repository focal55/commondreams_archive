<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->HALIFAX, Nova Scotia  - August 12 - The Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, 
returned to Halifax today with evidence of deep-sea destruction by high 
seas bottom trawlers. Greenpeace has collected images and documentation 
of the damage to deep-sea fish stocks and habitats in the international 
waters of the Northwest Atlantic.

<p>The Esperanza spent two weeks on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks 
and the Flemish Cap in international waters. Greenpeace observed 20 
bottom trawlers (1), and documented the fishing activities of half of 
these. Campaigners boarded five of the trawlers to discuss a United 
Nations moratorium on high seas bottom trawling.

<p>"We witnessed example after example of bad management, overfishing, and 
destruction of deep-sea life and habitat from heavy fishing gear being 
dragged over the seabed. We saw an indifference to the need to protect 
vulnerable and fragile ecosystems as well as suspect operators, such as 
the Lootus II, which are linked to illegal fishing in other parts of the 
globe," said Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace International Oceans 
Campaigner.  "If the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) 
(1) believes that this is the best example of a regional fisheries 
management organisation at work, then our ocean ecosystems are in very 
serious trouble."
 
<p>"We witnessed starfish, sponge, capelin, anemones, juvenile redfish and 
eelpout in the grates of the trawl nets, and as one skipper said, no 
matter how much you try and reduce bycatch, the nets cannot discriminate 
which fish they catch," added McDiarmid.

<p>The Spanish trawlers in the Greenland halibut fishery refused to discard 
their bycatch while Greenpeace was filming and one vessel the Lootus II 
kept its nets on the bottom for 18 hours to avoid hauling while 
Greenpeace was watching. Greenland halibut is on a 15 year rebuilding 
plan, which is already seen by many as too little too late.

<p>"Canada and Norway's call for reform within NAFO is absolutely 
meaningless without a moratorium on bottom trawling being in place while 
these changes are discussed, agreed and implemented," said Mark Butler 
of the Ecology Action Centre. "Reform will take time. Time scientists 
say deep-sea life does not have. Without a moratorium on high seas 
bottom trawling there may be nothing left to manage or protect."

<p>Greenpeace highlighted the mismanagement by NAFO during actions against 
Icelandic, Spanish and Estonian bottom trawlers in the shrimp and 
Greenland halibut fisheries. The actions exposed the irresponsible 
attitude of NAFO and its member states such as Canada.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force the solutions which are essential to a green and 
peaceful future.
