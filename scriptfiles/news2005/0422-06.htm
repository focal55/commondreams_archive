<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, DC and SANTA BARBARA, CA -- April 22 -- The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation is pleased to announce it will host a panel discussion entitled &#147;Reviving Disarmament in the Nonproliferation Regime&#148; on Wednesday, May 4, 2005 at the United Nations in New York.  This important panel discussion will identify current nuclear proliferation threats and offer recommendations to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), during the treaty&#146;s Seventh Review Conference, which is taking place at the UN from May 2-27, 2005.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eminent journalist Walter Cronkite will deliver the opening remarks. Panelists include: Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, Independent International Security Analyst; Hon. Marian Hobbs, New Zealand Minister for Disarmament; Dr. David Krieger, President of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation; and Hon. Douglas Roche, former Canadian Minister for Disarmament and Chair of the Middle Powers Initiative. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Foundation President Dr. David Krieger states, &#147;The Non-Proliferation Treaty is at a crossroads.  The 2005 NPT Review Conference provides a decisive opportunity to respond to the growing dangers of nuclear proliferation and to consider proposals within the context of the NPT goals that promote both short-term and long-term security for the world.  Without progress toward the treaty&#146;s nuclear disarmament goals, the non-proliferation regime could collapse.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 2005 Review Conference is critical in re-affirming existing NPT obligations and engaging all members of the international community in multilateral and universal non-proliferation and disarmament efforts.  During the panel discussion, the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation will offer eight specific proposals for addressing current proliferation trends and reviving nuclear disarmament. The Foundation will also make available copies of &#147;Back to Basics: Reviving Disarmament in the Non-Proliferation Regime,&#148; the Foundation&#146;s briefing booklet for the 2005 NPT Review Conference.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation is a non-profit, non-partisan international organization with consultative status to the United Nations.  For more than 20 years, the Foundation has been committed to advancing initiatives to eliminate the nuclear weapons threat to all life, to fostering the global rule of law, and to building an enduring legacy of peace through education and advocacy.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To arrange an interview with Dr. David Krieger or to receive more information on the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation&#146;s panel at the NPT Review Conference and order a copy of the briefing booklet, please contact the Foundation&#146;s Advocacy and Research Director Carah<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
