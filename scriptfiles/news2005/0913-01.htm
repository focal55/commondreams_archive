<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 12 - The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom/US Section offers 
our sincerest condolences to the survivors of Hurricane Katrina. In 
particular, WILPF extends its support to the women, poor women and women 
of color, as the brunt of disaster has and will ultimately fall on the 
shoulders of the most oppressed. Your struggles will remain in our 
hearts and minds.

<p>We demand that immediate aid and assistance be made available to those 
affected by this tragedy, and that long term solutions be sought out to 
dismantle the unjust, oppressive economic and political systems that led 
to much of this devastation. Katrina was a disaster created and 
maintained by a gross imbalance of power, one that teeters on the fault 
lines of race, class and gender. WILPF’s vision is a world where 
equality and justice, lived within a framework of ecological wisdom, 
shape the framework of our national life. Hurricane Katrina and its 
aftermath make it clear that our reality is something entirely 
different. WILPF see this tragedy through the lens of root causes: 
racism, militarism, and environmental degradation.

<p>While $2.2 billion per day is spent waging war and occupying Iraq, 
additional thousands are reportedly dead because New Orleans was not 
evacuated in time and the levees were not repaired. The federal 
government’s lethal ineptitude cannot be excused. All people, regardless 
of race or class, employed or unemployed, young or old, sick or healthy, 
are to be guaranteed the right to safety and protection. The government 
has the means and responsibility to provide for people’s needs in an 
emergency and to protect them from harm when necessary. Cuba, which has 
offered 1100 doctors to help in this emergency, was able to evacuate 1.5 
million people before a devastating hurricane last year. Not one life 
was lost.

<p>For the sake of all those who died, or have survived Katrina and bear 
the consequences, we call on the Bush Administration and Congress to

<p>*Provide food, water, shelter, clothing, medical supplies, schooling, 
and other necessities, free of charge.

<p>*Provide emergency medical care and measures to prevent massive epidemics.

<p>*Provide emergency unemployment relief to the thousands who have lost 
their jobs because of the devastation.

<p>*Provide a massive jobs program at union wages for rebuilding, employing 
the millions of unemployed workers in the Gulf Coast area to help 
construct housing, schools, and other public facilities.

<p>*Cease the militaristic measures of the police and National Guard troops 
who are surrounding emergency shelters. They must be instructed to 
protect people, not shoot them.

<p>*Stop funding the war and occupation of Iraq. Use the money instead to 
fund emergency relief and rebuild the cities destroyed in the hurricane.

<p>*Take Global Climate Change seriously. Ensure that all measures will be 
taken to prevent another human catastrophe of this nature, in view of 
other expected hurricanes and severe
natural events.

<p>The Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom has been working 
since 1915 to unite women worldwide who oppose oppression and 
exploitation. An international organization with sections in 37 
countries, WILPF stands for equality of all people in a world free of 
racism, sexism, and homophobia; the building of a constructive peace 
through world disarmament; and the changing of government priorities to 
meet human needs. U.S. WILPF envisions a world free of violence, 
poverty, pollution, and domination – a genuine new world order of peace 
and justice. We seek to achieve lasting change predominantly through our 
two current campaigns, Save the Water and Women Challenging US Policy: 
Building Peace on Justice in the Middle East.<!-- #EndEditable -->
