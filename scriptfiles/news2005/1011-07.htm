<p>WASHINGTON - Scott Ritter, Former UN Weapons Inspector and author of the  newly released Iraq Confidential, will be available for media Q &amp;  A on Wednesday, October 12 in Washington at a 9 a.m. breakfast  briefing at the National Press Club, 529 14th Street NW, 13th  floor, co-sponsored by Nation Books and the Government  Accountability Project.
<p>   One-on-one interviews, schedule permitting, can be arranged  for Tuesday afternoon, October 11 and Thursday, October 13  (morning only).</p>

<p>   Ritter is available to discuss his book, which reveals how the  CIA manipulated the work of UN departments to achieve the U.S.'s  foreign policy agenda in the Middle East, and current concerns  including:</p>
<p>   -- His views on an exit strategy from Iraq</p>
<p>   -- The state of current intelligence on Iran</p>
<p>   -- The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday to the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its chief, Mohamed  ElBaradei. ElBaradei led a team of weapons inspectors in Iraq and  questioned whether Iraq had nuclear weapons during the run up to  the US invasion there. The Bush Administration recently opposed  ElBaradei's third terms as chief of the IAEA, on the grounds he  would be too soft on Iran.</p><p align="center">###</p>
