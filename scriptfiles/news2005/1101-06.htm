WASHINGTON - November 1 - House Democratic Leader  Nancy Pelosi released the following statement today on the report  issued this morning by the President's Advisory Panel on Federal  Tax Reform: 
</p>
<p>   &quot;Democrats are committed to reforming the tax code so that our  tax system is simpler and fairer for middle-class families and  small business.  Unfortunately, President Bush's tax panel is a  Trojan horse -- using so-called simplification to cut taxes for  the wealthy while increasing taxes for middle-class families. </p>
<p>   &quot;Middle-class families are already struggling to pay high  prices at the gas pump, exploding home heating costs,  skyrocketing tuitions, and rising health care costs.  The  President's tax panel would demolish the building blocks middle- class Americans use to reach the American dream -- home ownership,  education, health care, and earnings. </p>
<p>   &quot;The President's tax panel would severely limit the mortgage- interest deduction, end the deduction for state and local taxes,  ends education incentives, and limit the deduction for health  insurance expenses. Each of these would be a severe blow to the  middle class. </p>
<p>   &quot;We need an America that works for everyone, not just the  wealthy few.  Democrats will continue to fight for tax reform  that simplifies the tax code without hurting the middle class.&quot; </p>
