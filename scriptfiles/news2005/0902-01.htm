<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->LOS ANGELES - September 2 - The Future of Food, a feature documentary by Deborah Koons Garcia, offers a startling look at the changes happening in our food system today. For the first time, a feature film takes an in-depth look at the takeover of our food supply by multinational corporations and the widespread advent of unlabeled, patented, and unregulated genetically modified crops and foods. The film will premiere in New York at Film Forum on September 14 and widen thereafter. 

 

<p>The film has been utilized around the world as a key anti-GMO (genetically modified organisms) activist tool by grassroots organizations such as the <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org" target="_new">Organic Consumers Association</a>, The <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org" target="_new">Center for Food Safety</a> and <a href="http://www.thecampaign.org" target="_new">The Campaign</a>. Ronnie Cummins, author of Genetically Engineered Food: A Self-Defense Guide for Consumers and Director of the Organic Consumers Association calls The Future of Food "the most powerful documentary we have ever used in educating consumers." The film was a key part of the success of passing Measure H in 2004 in Mendocino County, California, which was one of the first local initiatives in the country to ban the planting of GMO crops.  

 

<p>Most Americans are unaware that GMO crops are now growing on well over 100 million acres of America's farmlands. An estimated 80% of all soy, over 35% of all corn, 75% of all cotton and most canola in the marketplace are now genetically engineered. Of these crops, an estimated 80% are now used for animal feed. The other 20% of GMO crops turn up on America's supermarket shelves in everything from corn tortillas, to snack foods that contain soy lecithin, canola oil, and corn syrup.  These genetically engineered organisms have found their way into consumer foods like milk and other dairy products with the introduction of Bovine Growth Hormone, another widely prevalent GMO from the agribusiness biotech giant, Monsanto. 

 

<p>National organic standards from the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture do not permit crops containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to be certified organic -- and certified organic foods are soaring in popularity as the last bastion of GMO-free eating. The issues at stake in the race to protect our food system are numerous. 

<p>
<ul>
<li>Labeling is a key issue: The United States and Canada are the only industrialized countries in the world that do not yet have labeling either in place or underway, while the European Union and 40 other countries around the world already do.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Pre-emptive legislation: Monsanto and the American Farm Bureau have been behind "pre-emption laws" in 14 states.  Often referred to as the "Monsanto Law," they are intended to prevent local counties and townships from banning the growing of genetically engineered crops and animals.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>GMO pollution: Biotech companies are rushing recklessly ahead in planting new crops, such as genetically engineered alfalfa and bio-pharmaceutical crops, even though they are well aware they cannot control genetic pollution.<br>

</ul>
<p>In cities across the country, events such as speakers' panels on topics such as genetics, patenting and the future of organics will be organized to support the opening of the film. In conjunction with the September release of the film in New York, healthy food organizations such as GRACE, Slow Food, Just Food, NYSAGE, Consumers Union, the Center for Food Safety and local CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture initiatives), will introduce the film and facilitate discussions after selected screenings. In the East Village in New York, Bluestockings Bookstore (www.Bluestockings.com) will host a series of after-screening discussion cafes where audience members will be invited to participate in discussions about the issues raised in the film, and to find out how they can participate locally.

 

<p>The award-winning documentary will premiere at Film Forum in New York on September 14.  Following the premiere, the film will widen to cities across the nation including Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Berkeley (CA), Boston, Seattle, Denver, Boulder and Chicago.  Distribution will be handled by Cinema Libre Studio.
