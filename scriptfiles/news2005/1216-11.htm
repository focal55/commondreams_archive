<p>WASHINGTON  - December 16 - In a desperate, last-ditch effort to force Congress to approve drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Senator Stevens -- the man who brought&#160;us the $450 million &quot;bridges to nowhere&quot; -- is moving the controversial drilling provision to a must-pass Defense spending bill.

</p>

<p>

  &quot;Stevens has failed&#160;to pass Arctic drilling through stand-alone legislation, as part of an energy bill and tacked on to the budget, so he&#160;is now threatening to hold the&#160;Defense Appropriations bill hostage, drawing criticism from both sides of aisle.

</p>

<p>

  &#160;&#8220;We applaud the Democrats for standing united against this ploy as well as those moderate Republicans for their steadfast opposition to these sneaky Arctic drilling schemes. Their refusal to let drilling proponents manipulate them and the federal budget has forced Stevens to play one final, desperate hand.&#8221;

</p>

<p>

  &#8220;Stevens apparently can&#8217;t decide if he wants to be Ebenezer Scrooge or the Grinch &#8211; or both &#8211; this Christmas. He has threatened to stay until Christmas and use any means possible to force though his pet project of Arctic drilling.&#8221;

</p>

<p>

  &#160;&quot;This outrageous move is a betrayal of the public's trust, an abuse of power, and a great to disservice to our troops, not to mention it would spoil forever a national treasure. Congress should stand strong against Senator Stevens and reject this exploitation of our troops and our natural heritage.&quot;

</p>

<p>

  *&quot;This is the end game, O.K., and I have been involved in end games for a lot of years,&quot; Mr. Stevens said. &quot;As far as I'm concerned, I'm not leaving. I have canceled my trip home. I will be here through Christmas if necessary.&quot; (New York Times, &#8220;Republicans Try to Outflank Democrats on Key Measures,&#8221; 12/16/2005)&#160;

</p>

<p>

  *&quot;We are still exploring the possibility we might put ANWR on [the defense bill],&quot; Stevens said. &quot;It will be on one bill or the other before I go home.&quot; (E&amp;E Daily, &#8220;Arctic drilling proponents may turn to defense bill,&#8221; 12/15/2005)
