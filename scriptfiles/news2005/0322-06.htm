<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 22 -- The Union of Concerned Scientists today announced that 22,757 consumers have sent false advertising complaints to the Federal Trade Commission about an Alliance of Automobile Manufactures ad that claims: &quot;Autos manufactured today are virtually emission-free.&quot; Todays typical auto actually releases more global warming emissions than they did 20 years ago. In fact, only 4 nations in the world emit more total heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels than U.S. autos release alone. <br> <br>With this deceptive ad campaign, automakers are now attempting to hide the harmful nature of their products much like cigarette makers did, said David Friedman, Research Director of the Union of Concerned Scientists Clean Vehicles Program. &quot;New vehicles produce too many harmful emissions for automakers to misrepresent the facts. Instead, they need to put technologies to work to clean up their vehicles and protect our families and kids.&quot; <br> <br>To counter the auto lobbys false ad, UCS has created its own ad to run in the same media outlets where the Alliance advertised. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency demonstrates that the dirtiest autos made today actually emit 40 times more smog-forming pollution than a Ford Escape Hybrid. And even under tighter government standards, autos will still emit 350,000 tons a year in 2020 when most vehicles on the road will meet tighter Tier 2 standards. But, more egregiously, the Auto Alliance ignores entirely the heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from their vehicles, which will total more than 1,300 million tons this year. <br> <br>&quot;The Auto Alliance must think that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will start to believe it,&quot; said Friedman. &quot;The Alliance's strategy is an irresponsible attempt to shift the focus of the pollution debate completely away from cars and trucks.&quot; <br> <br>The Alliance placed its false ad claims in media outlets read or heard by policymakers at a time when Congress has been discussing the potential rollback of important aspects of the Clean Air Act. The Auto Alliance is also the lead group suing to stop landmark state regulations on global warming emissions from autos. <br> <br>To view the Auto Alliances deceptive ad and UCSs response ad, go to: <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/general/special_features/page.cfm?pageID=1667" target="_new">http://www.ucsusa.org/general/special_features/page.cfm?pageID=1667</a> </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
