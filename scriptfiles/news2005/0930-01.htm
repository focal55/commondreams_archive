<p>WASHINGTON - September 30 - Members of both political parties and the public have decried the government's response to Hurricane Katrina and the timeliness of providing basic aid to the Gulf states. In addition, concerns have been raised about a host of issues, including the role of poverty and race, what the federal response to Katrina says about our homeland security efforts and the role of government. 

<p>The Moving Ideas Network released a report, "<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/katrina_policy_action.htm">Katrina: Progressive Policy and Action Guide</a>", which is a compilation of resources from the progressive community on these policy issues. In addition, the guide provides opportunities to help Katrina victims, rethink our nation's priorities and hold government accountable for its failed response.

<p>"After such a horrible disaster people are looking for answers and ways to get involved," says Moving Ideas Network Director Melanie Alston-Akers. "This policy and action guide provides people with all these resources in one place."

<p>This guide includes an action alert calling for Congress to establish an independent, bipartisan commission that would fully assess the federal government's response and how we can improve preparedness for future natural disasters.

<p>Policy resources cover issues from relief efforts, race & poverty, and children & families to homeland security, media coverage, the environment, and the role of government & its accountability.
