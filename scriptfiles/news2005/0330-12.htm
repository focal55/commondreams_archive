<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 30 -- The expertise and technological capabilities of the United States can make significant contributions toward realizing the opportunities that come in arresting the pace of environmental degradation worldwide, said former Senator Timothy E. Wirth, who is President of the United Nations Foundation.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is an exhaustive, landmark report surveying how humans have changed the ecosystems more rapidly and more extensively over the last 50 years than during any other period,&#148; Wirth said.  &#147;Future demands on our planet&#146;s ecosystems cannot be sustained without devastating, irreversible damage on the ability to sustain life on earth.  Our future is absolutely dependent on our success in reversing the degradation of our ecosystems while satisfying growing demand for food, fresh water, energy, and other resources.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The report makes clear that it is still possible to ease the strains on our planet by making significant changes in policies, institutions, behavior, technology, and knowledge.  U.S. leadership is critical in providing much-needed expertise, technological capabilities, and ingenuity to restore eco systems.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We can take steps at home to reduce our nation&#146;s adverse impact on the global environment.  We can encourage businesses to realize the opportunities to save ecosystems.  We can work with the United Nations and others to develop an effective set of responses to ensure sustainable management of ecosystems.  We can provide capital and share our knowledge, thereby addressing two key barriers to reversing ecosystem degradation.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Climate change is a primary example of a problem that should be viewed as an opportunity to transform our energy sector and our economy, to provide access to energy for the world&#146;s poor, and to slow the rate of carbon into the atmosphere &#150; while developing a strong job base at home.    </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;A staggering $16 trillion will be needed in world energy investments, for example, over the next 25 years.  This may be the largest job creation opportunity for the United States in the 21st century.  Let us realize these opportunities by addressing head on the challenges today&#146;s report outlines.&#148;    </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report, funded partly by the United Nations Foundation, was designed by a partnership of U.N. agencies, international scientific organizations, and development agencies, with guidance from private and public sectors.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report warns that the ongoing degradation of 15 of the 24 ecosystems it examined will increase the likelihood for potentially abrupt changes, including the emergence of new diseases, inadequate safe drinking-water supplies, the collapse of fisheries, and dramatic shifts in regional climate.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report calls for responses that would influence the level of production and consumption of ecosystem goods services, including changes in institutional and environmental governance frameworks, the implementation of economic and financial incentives to protect the environment,  the creation of new technologies,  and improvements in knowledge.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The UN Foundation was created in 1998 with businessman and philanthropist Ted Turner&#146;s historic $1 billion gift to support United Nations&#146; causes.
