<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- March 14 -- Today Tamara Draut, Director of the Economic Opportunity Program at Demos, a leading national nonpartisan think tank, issued the following statement responding to the United States Senate's March 10, 2005, passage of S. 256&#151;the so-called bankruptcy &quot;reform&quot; bill: </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is clearly the wrong bill at the wrong time. More American families are living paycheck-to-paycheck, and many of them are facing an explosive increase in living expenses&#151;like housing, medical care, and education. This bill erects barriers that could keep thousands of desperate households&#151;the majority of whom are the victims of a medical illness, job loss or divorce&#151;from getting back on their feet financially. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This legislation, which was pushed through the Senate at lightning-speed, was aggressively lobbied for by the credit card industry, whose abusive practices make it nearly impossible for families to climb out of debt. The credit card companies are the only winners here. Everybody else loses. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With interest rates rising and the threat of bankruptcy defused, credit card companies are likely to escalate the abusive tactics that have buoyed them to record profits in recent years. Real consumer bankruptcy reform would curb the practices that make it virtually impossible for households to pay off their debt, which include $35 penalty fees, capricious interest rate hikes that double or even triple the rate on the card, and the odious new &#145;universal default' clause that can multiply consumers' entire debt loads because of activity on a single account. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Members of Congress owe the American people a real inquiry into the factors driving the debt crisis in America. Any debate about bankruptcy &#145;reform' that ignores the structural economic issues facing families is short-sighted, dangerous to family economic security, and does nothing to address the long-term health of our economy.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information about the Economic Opportunity Program, or to download the Households at Risk bankruptcy briefing kit, visit <a href="http://www.demos-usa.org/" target="_new">www.demos-usa.org</a>. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Demos: A Network for Ideas &amp; Action is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy organization based in New York. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
