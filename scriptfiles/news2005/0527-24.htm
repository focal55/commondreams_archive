<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 27 - A coalition of veterans' groups, peace groups, and political activist groups announced a campaign today to urge that the U.S. Congress launch a formal investigation into whether President Bush has committed impeachable offenses in connection with the Iraq war.  The campaign focuses on evidence that recently emerged in a British memo containing minutes of a secret July 2002 meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top national security officials.</font>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Bonifaz, a Boston attorney specializing in constitutional litigation, sent a memo to Congressman John Conyers of Michigan, the Ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, urging him to introduce a Resolution of Inquiry directing the House Judiciary Committee to launch a formal investigation into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House to impeach President Bush.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bonifaz's memo, made available today at www.AfterDowningStreet.org, begins: &quot;The recent release of the Downing Street Memo provides new and compelling evidence that the President of the United States has been actively engaged in a conspiracy to deceive and mislead the United States Congress and the American people about the basis for going to war against Iraq.  If true, such conduct constitutes a High Crime under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February and March 2003, John Bonifaz served as lead counsel for a coalition of United States soldiers, parents of U.S. soldiers, and Members of Congress (led by Representatives John Conyers, Jr. and Dennis Kucinich) in a federal lawsuit challenging President George W. Bush&#146;s authority to wage war against Iraq absent a congressional declaration of war or equivalent action.  Bonifaz is the author of Warrior-King: The Case for Impeaching George W. Bush (NationBooks-NY, 2004, foreword by Rep. John Conyers, Jr.), which chronicles that case and its meaning for the United States Constitution.</font></p>

These organizations, beginning today, will be urging their members to contact their Representatives to urge support of a Resolution of Inquiry.</font></p>
