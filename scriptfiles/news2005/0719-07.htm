<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 19  - Today, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance, called on Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-CO) to apologize to all Muslims and all Americans and emphatically retract his recent radio remarks suggesting that the United States should consider a nuclear strike against Mecca, Islam's most holy site, as a possible response to a hypothetical attack on American cities by radical fundamentalists.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gaddy also called on President Bush to assure the world that Congressman Tancredo does not speak for the United States government or for the American people, and that the United States will never consider using nuclear weapons on a holy site. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Military action against a religious target would violate American values honoring religions and religious liberty,&quot; Gaddy said. &quot;Together we must work toward mutual understanding and education about the central role religion plays in American culture and around the world. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To promote peace and understanding, The Interfaith Alliance also urges President Bush to repudiate Congressman Tancredo's inflammatory rhetoric,&quot; Gaddy said. &quot;This action by the President would help to reassure the world that America respects religions and that we will never manipulate any religion as a weapon or a threat.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a July 14 press release from his congressional office, the same day of his radio remarks contemplating a nuclear threat to Mecca, &quot;Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-CO) demanded an immediate apology and unequivocal repudiation of Major General Zhu Chenghu's nuclear threat against the United States..Tancredo chided China's communist government, noting that, 'For a senior government official to exhibit such tremendous stupidity by making such a brazen threat is hardly characteristic of a modern nation..'&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. Tancredo should heed his own words and apply that statement to himself,&quot; Gaddy said. </font></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;    </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
