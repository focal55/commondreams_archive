<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BRUSSELS / AMSTERDAM - June 30 - The UK Government has prioritised <br>climate change for their G8 (1) and EU Presidencies this year (2) and <br>less than a week before the G8 Summit starts (7-8 July), Greenpeace and <br>the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) launched &quot;Windforce 12&quot;, a global <br>industry blueprint that describes how wind power can supply 12 % of the <br>world's electricity by 2020 (3). The report is a crucial tool in the <br>race to cut greenhouse gas emissions as 12% electricity from total of <br>1,250 GW of wind power installed will save a cumulative 10,771 million <br>tonnes of CO2 .</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also highlights that thirteen key countries around the world <br>can play a leadership role to help unlock the major market deployment <br>envisaged by this industry blueprint: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, <br>France, India, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, Poland, Turkey, the UK and <br>the USA. These markets are at an early but developing stage, and provide <br>an insight into where major wind growth may be achieved.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wind energy has a huge role to play in our energy future and in <br>combating climate change. It is already one of the fastest growing <br>energy sectors in the world. G8 nations must encourage and support wind <br>power developments worldwide to ensure that we can curb greenhouse gas <br>emissions,&quot; said Sven Teske, of Greenpeace International.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, wind power installed in Europe is saving over 50 million tonnes <br>of CO2 a year and on track by 2010 to deliver one third of the EU's <br>Kyoto commitment. In the report, the value of the global market for wind <br>turbines is to move from the current &euro;8 billion to an &euro; 80 billion <br>annual business by 2020. Wind power is one of the most effective power <br>technologies that is ready today for global deployment on the requisite <br>scale, and can be installed far quicker than other conventional power <br>stations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wind power is one of the few energy supply technologies that is ready <br>for a broader roll out today; wind has the maturity, clout and global <br>muscle to deliver deep cuts in CO2, while providing a hedge against <br>fluctuating fossil fuel prices and reduce energy import dependence&quot;, <br>said Corin Millais, of the Global Wind Energy Council. &quot;The global <br>energy challenge of our time is not only to tackle climate change, but <br>to meet the rising demand for energy and to safeguard security of energy <br>supplies. As a power technology which can meet these three challenges, <br>wind energy is a leading candidate.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wind energy is a significant resource; it is safe, clean, and abundant. <br>Unlike conventional fuels, wind energy is an indigenous supply <br>permanently available in virtually every nation in the world, delivering <br>energy security benefits of avoided fuel costs, eliminating long term <br>fuel price risk, and avoids the economic, political and supply risks of <br>dependence on imports from other countries.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With no intervention, the International Energy Association (IEA) <br>estimates that, under current trends, the world's electricity demand <br>could double from 2002 to 2030, accounting for 60% of new investment in <br>energy supply by then. The global power sector requires 4,800GW - <br>2,000GW of this in the OECD - of new capacity to meet increasing demand <br>and replacing aging infrastructure, at a cost of &euro;10,000 billion in <br>power generation, transmission and distribution. By 2030, the power <br>sector could account for 45% of global carbon emissions. The investment <br>choices made now will determine the level of emissions of carbon dioxide <br>for many decades.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A copy of the Wind Force 12 report can be downloaded at:<br>The link is still the same: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/windforce-12-2005<br>www.gwec.net; www.ewea.org</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notes to Editors:<br>(1). The International Climate Change Task Force convened by Tony Blair <br>and the European Council see climate change as &quot;probably, long-term the <br>single most important issue we face as a global community&quot;. For this <br>reason climate change will be a priority during the UK's G8 Presidency <br>this year, along with Africa.&quot; (www.g8.gov.uk )</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January, the report 'Meeting the climate challenge' - Recommendations <br>of the International Climate Change Task Force concluded that &quot;a long <br>term objective be established to prevent global average temperature from <br>rising more than 2OC above the pre-industrial level&quot;;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;G8 Governments establish national renewable portfolio standards to <br>generate at least 25% of electricity from renewable energy sources by <br>2025, with higher targets needed for some G8 Governments&quot;;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Governments remove barriers to and increase investment in renewable <br>energy and energy efficient technologies and practice such measures as <br>the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2). The European Commission report Action on Climate Change post 2012 <br>published in February this year stated that &quot;Renewable energies will <br>have to play a much larger role in the future&quot;. The 2004 European <br>Environment Agency (EEA) assessment on greenhouse gas emission trends in <br>Europe concluded that &quot;the promotion of renewable energy has the <br>greatest impact on emissions in most EU Member States for both <br>implemented and planned policies&quot;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3). &quot;Wind Force 12, a blueprint to achieve 12% of the world's <br>electricity from wind power by 2020&quot;. This report is the main global <br>wind energy assessment. It has been conducted since 1999 by EWEA (the <br>European Wind Energy Association) and Greenpeace International. The 2005 <br>report has been completed by Greenpeace and EWEA on behalf of the GWEC - <br>the Global Wind Energy Council.<br></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
