<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 29 - As President Bush prepares to leave for   the (Group of 8) G-8    Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, Jubilee USA Network   announced today that    more than 10,000 people of faith and conscience all   over the country wrote    to President Bush and Treasury Secretary Snow to   enact 100% cancellation of    debt to all multilateral creditors for all   impoverished countries without    harmful economic conditions. Jubilee USA will   deliver these letters to    administration officials on Thursday.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debt, aid, and trade are to lead the agenda of the   G-8 Summit, with    President Bush anticipated to make a statement on   fresh aid to Africa.    Civil society groups around the world are mobilizing   to ensure the G-8    heeds their calls; Live 8 concerts and activities   organized by the Global    Call to Action against Poverty are among the events   to be held globally    over the next couple of weeks.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      Jubilee USA Network remains focused on urging G-8   leaders to conclusively    end the debt crisis. While the debt agreement   reached at the G-8 Finance    Ministers meeting cancels 100% of 18 impoverished   countries' debts to the    International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and   African Development    Bank, it excludes other impoverished nations and   debt to other significant    creditors. Jubilee USA Network insists that the deal   must be expanded to    include all impoverished nations. The Network   further demands that the G-8    provide immediate cancellation to additional   impoverished nations without    forcing them to implement harmful economic policies   as part of the HIPC    (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Initiative.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      &quot;The agreement likely to be approved by G-8 leaders   at their summit in    Gleneagles for 100% cancellation of debt to the IMF,   World Bank, and    African Development Fund for some impoverished   nations is a first step on a    long journey towards freedom from debt for all   impoverished nations,&quot; said    Neil Watkins, National Coordinator of Jubilee USA   Network. &quot;But the G-8    must expand its agreement to include all   impoverished countries, not just    those classified as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries   (HIPC), and debt    cancellation must come without subjecting these   countries to devastating    economic conditions.&quot;      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee USA Network has just published a report   analyzing the likely G-8    debt agreement, entitled &quot;First Step on A Long   Journey: Putting the G-8    Deal on Debt into Perspective.&quot; The report   highlights the benefits of the    G-8 debt agreement, with recommendations of next   steps for the G-8 to fully    cancel the debts of impoverished nations. The report   and executive summary    are available at <a href="http://www.jubileeusa.org" target="_new">www.jubileeusa.org</a>.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The G-8 debt agreement would establish an important   precedent, long    advocated by Jubilee USA Network, that poor   countries must receive 100%    cancellation of their debts to multilateral   creditors.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, too many impoverished nations are excluded   from the deal, and will    continue to spend more on debt service than on   healthcare and education.    The 18 countries that qualify immediately represent   less than a third of    countries that need full cancellation to meet the   internationally agreed    Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which seek to   halve extreme poverty by    2015. The $40 billion to be cancelled by this   agreement represents less    than 10% of debt cancellation required for nations   to meet the MDGs. It    does not include middle-income countries that are   heavily indebted and    impoverished.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The economic policies mandated by the HIPC   Initiative and continued under    the G-8 debt agreement include privatization of   government-run services and    industries, increased trade liberalization, and   budgetary spending    restrictions. These policies have not been proven to   increase per capita    income growth or reduce poverty as documented by   both World Bank and civil    society economists. Jubilee USA and social movements   call for these    conditions and policies to be abandoned.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee USA Network notes that the G-8 debt   agreement is an important first    step towards the Jubilee vision of a world where   external debt no longer    diverts resources from impoverished people or   constrains policy choices.    Jubilee USA Network will continue to work for debt   cancellation for more    countries (such as impoverished countries not   included in this deal, middle    income countries with large impoverished populations   and those with    odious/illegitimate debts) and creditors (such as   the Inter-American    Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, bilateral,   and private creditors)    not included in this year's initiative in the years   ahead.      <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee USA Network is the US arm of the   international movement working for    debt cancellation for impoverished nations. Jubilee   USA is a network of    over 70 religious denominations, labor groups,   environmental organizations,    and community and advocacy groups working for   freedom from debt for    countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.<br></font></p><center><p>###</p></center><!-- #EndEditable -->
