<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 28 -- Media activists have some cause for celebration today.  Their widespread opposition to the Federal Communications Commission's sweeping media consolidation rules helped convince the Bush Administration not to appeal a federal district court ruling that stopped those rules from taking effect.  The decision not to appeal was announced Thursday, January 27.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's decision makes it less likely that the Supreme Court will take up the case, meaning the fight will go back to the FCC.  &quot;Knowing that our efforts made a difference, we need to keep on fighting for media reform,&quot; Common Cause President Chellie Pingree said.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June 2003, Common Cause and millions of Americans opposed the FCC's proposals  to allow one company to own up to three television stations, the local newspaper, up to eight radio stations, and the local cable system in one community. Common Cause helped lead a broad based campaign that resulted in more than two million Americans sending the FCC comments in opposition to allowing media companies to get bigger.  When a handful of media companies control much of what the public sees on TV and read in the newspaper, our democracy suffers from the lack of diverse voices and sources of news and information.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June 2004, the Third Circuit US. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia overturned the FCC's ill-advised rules.  Now, the U.S. Solicitor General has decided not to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court, making it unlikely that the high court will hear the case. The FCC now must go back to the drawing board and reconsider the media ownership rules. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FCC now has a chance  to do what it failed to do before: involve the public in a meaningful way as it reconsiders these ownership rules.  It is crucial that the Bush Administration name a new FCC chairman who actively seeks public comment on this important issue.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause will push the FCC to work in the public' interest, which means listening to the concerns of average citizens, and holding hearings in all parts of the country.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This decision is a step in a long road towards building a media that truly responds to the needs of citizens,&quot; Pingree said. &quot;But it is a step in which we can all take heart and move forward.&quot; <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
