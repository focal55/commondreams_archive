<p>WASHINGTON - December 29 - In January, local  groups around the country will mobilize to protest the  implementation of the US-Dominican Republic-Central America Free  Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA).  CAFTA passed in the US House of  Representatives by a mere 2 votes in July after a draining  political battle.</p>
<p>   January 1, 2006 marks the date that the Bush Administration  had set for implementation of CAFTA.  However,  progress has been frustrated in various countries where the US  insists on the need for constitutional reforms before  CAFTA goes into effect, while in Costa Rica the parliament has  yet to bring CAFTA to a vote, despite recent  threats from the U.S. ambassador.</p>
<p>   According to Christin Baker, a spokesperson for the U.S. Trade  Representative, "we want CAFTA-DR to start as close as possible  to January 1, 2006, so that U.S. and regional businesses can  begin taking advantage of the Agreement's benefits in the  shortest possible time."   But even in El Salvador, the country  closest to finalizing its constitutional reforms, President Tony  Saca has announced that conflicts within the Salvadoran Assembly  will prevent implementation until at least February. The Bush  administration continues to push reforms to the remaining  countries' domestic laws before they can comply with the broad  changes that CAFTA imposes.</p>
<p>   "The problems associated with implementing CAFTA demonstrate  what we've been saying all along: this agreement goes beyond  trade in requiring dramatic changes in domestic laws that grant  new rights to transnational corporations at the expense of  working people," said Tom Ricker of the Quixote Center.  "The  fact that legislatures throughout Central America and in the  Dominican Republic are now struggling to change laws governing  intellectual property, services, and investment -- in order to  receive US certification for joining CAFTA -- makes clear the  undemocratic nature of this agreement." </p>
<p>   According to Burke Stansbury from the Committee in Solidarity  with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), "from day one the Bush  administration has been trying to ram CAFTA down people's  throats, with little substantive debate and despite voices of  tremendous opposition.  In Costa Rica they have failed, and in  other countries it took repression and dirty tactics to ratify  CAFTA.  But just as Central American social movements continue to  resist the imposition of this devastating agreement, we too are  not giving up."</p>
<p>   Organizations from throughout Central America recently met in  Costa Rica for the 5th Mesoamerican Forum where they pledged to  continue fighting CAFTA, and to mobilize huge protests for the  visit of President Bush to El Salvador in mid-January.  In the  US, the Stop CAFTA Coalition is organizing coordinated, local  anti-CAFTA actions in January to denounce the likely effects of  the agreement in Central America and to hold accountable  Representatives and Senators who voted in favor of CAFTA in July.</p>
