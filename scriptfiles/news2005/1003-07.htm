<p>WASHINGTON - NARAL Pro-Choice America  said the public expects Harriet Miers, President Bush's second  nominee for the Supreme Court, to demonstrate that she shares  retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's commitment to fundamental  freedoms, such as the right to privacy as guaranteed by Roe v.  Wade. </p>
<p>   "The burden is on the Bush administration and Harriet Miers to  prove to the American people that she will respect and protect  our fundamental freedoms, including a woman's right to choose.   Miers does not appear to have a public record to assure America's  pro-choice majority that she is a moderate in the tradition of  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the critical swing vote that  protected women's reproductive health and freedom. The president  has known Miers for many years, so it's incumbent upon his  administration and this nominee to share with the American public  her views on critical issues, including the right to privacy,"  said Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. "As the  Court prepares to hear two cases affecting women's reproductive  rights this fall, the public does not want President Bush to  replace Justice O'Connor with someone who would roll back  protections for women's health. With so much at stake, the burden  of proof is on Miers and the Bush administration to provide  evidence that she will continue the O'Connor tradition of  independence, moderation, and reason."</p>
