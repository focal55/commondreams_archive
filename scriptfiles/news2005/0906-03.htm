<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - September 2 - For many Americans outside of the Gulf Coast, the most immediate impact of
Hurricane Katrina isn't looting in the streets, it's looting at the pumps. And
while the supply crunch caused by Katrina may be the biggest driver of higher
gasoline prices, there's little question who stands to benefit: Big Oil.<br>
<br>
In just the last week, the stock prices of major U.S. oil producers ExxonMobil,
ChevronTexaco and Conoco-Phillips have surged by 4%, 5% and 8%, respectively.
Over the last year, their stock prices have increased by 31%, 26% and, for
Conoco-Phillips, a whopping 80%.<br>
<br>
Major oil refiners have done even better, with Valero (20%), Marathon Oil (11%)
and Sunoco (23%) posting double-digit percentage increases in stock prices
between the opening of markets last Friday and today's open.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, refineries are set to make huge profits this weekend and beyond,
with the profit margin for refiners up to more than $23 per barrel -- more than
50% higher than two weeks ago and more than four times higher than a year ago.<br>
<br>
Americans have the right to ask whether such massive profits are appropriate at
a time of national crisis. And they have a right to demand that government work
to protect Americans from being held captive by Big Oil in the future by
improving the energy efficiency of our cars and trucks and reducing our overall
dependence on fossil fuels.
