<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MONTREAL, Canada - September 26 - Greenpeace today welcomed a 
Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calling it a long 
awaited clarification of the limits of the technology as a means to 
combat climate change.

<p>The report, which studies the options for capturing CO2 from fossil fuel 
and storing or disposing of it under the ground or oceans, was formally 
accepted at a meeting of Working Group III of the IPCC in Montreal on 24 
September (1).

<p>"This report confirms what we already suspected' said Greenpeace Germany 
Climate and Energy Campaigner Gabriela von Goerne. "There are still far 
too many questions about environmental risk, safety and costs for CCS to 
be deployed on a scale that would make it economically viable"

<p>"It will simply not be ready in time to provide us with the huge near 
term emissions cuts that we need in order to avoid catastrophic climate 
change"

<p>The report found that the most effective use of CCS could be in the 
electricity sector but that this technology would likely only be 
deployed at a large scale in the second half of this century.

<p>"It seems ironic that this technology, which is so frequently promoted 
by some governments and industries as part of a 'voluntary' package to 
replace the Kyoto Protocol, can only succeed within a mandatory 'cap and 
trade' regime that would keep the price of carbon high" said von Goerne.

<p>"CCS might be an option in the future when all the questions have been 
answered and problems ironed out but there is an urgent need for 
immediate action. That action should be the massive and widespread 
deployment of available renewable energy and energy efficiency 
technologies combined with energy conservation," she added.

<p>Note to Editors:
(1) Formal approval on Monday morning by the full IPCC Plenary in Montreal.
