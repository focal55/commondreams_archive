<p>WASHINGTON - October 20 - With Whittendon Pond  Dam threatening to collapse and flood downtown Taunton,  Mass., conservationists praised stepped up action to  inspect potentially unsafe dams across the rain-soaked  state -- and called on officials to closely evaluate whether  dismantling some of them would make more economic and  environmental sense than repairing them. On Tuesday, Gov.  Mitt Romney committed the state to emergency inspection of 180  dams. </p>
<p>   &quot;We commend Mayor Nunes and state officials for acting swiftly  to protect the public during this emergency,&quot; said Elizabeth  Maclin, who directs the dam removal campaign for American Rivers.  &quot;When the crisis passes, we call on those leaders to help  communities consider removing dangerous old dams to permanently  protect those who live downstream.&quot; </p>
<p>   There are thousands of neglected, aging dams like Whittendon  Pond Dam all across the country that are accidents waiting to  happen. Removing those dams that no longer serve a  purpose -- carefully, during periods of low water -- is often a  cost-effective and permanent solution to the problem. Removing  dams also leads to cleaner water, better habitat, healthier fish  and wildlife populations, and new opportunities for the community  to enjoy the river. For these reasons, the pace of dam removal is  accelerating. Almost 200 dams have been deliberately demolished  since 1999 and 50 more are slated for removal in 2005. </p>
<p>   Massachusetts has a modest dam removal program and has worked  with local communities to remove several unwanted dams in recent  years. In 2003, Silk Mill Dam was removed from Yokum Brook  outside of Becket. In 2002, Billington Street Dam was removed  from Town Brook near Plymouth. In 2000, Old Berkshire Mill Dam  was removed from the Housatonic River near the down of Dalton. </p>
<p>   Massachusetts still has a long list of likely candidates for  removal. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' National  Inventory of Dams, there are more than 3,000 dams in the state of  Massachusetts. More than 330 of those are classified high hazard  - meaning their collapse would threaten life and  property -- while 731 threaten at least property. </p>
<p>   The state classified Whittendon Pond Dam as high hazard and in  &quot;fair&quot; condition in its most recent inspection. Although the  state of Massachusetts lists only 40 dams as being in poor  condition, there are many more such as the Whittenton Pond Dam  that are listed in fair condition but are nonetheless vulnerable  to large storms and heavy rains. </p>
<p>   &quot;Massachusetts needs to act quickly to fix the dams worth  keeping and dismantle those that aren't,&quot; Maclin said. &quot;The state  should start with those that are at greatest risk of collapse but  shouldn't stop there.&quot; </p>
<p>   American Rivers urged Massachusetts elected officials to  examine the dam safety and removal programs in Pennsylvania and  Wisconsin. These two states have developed regulatory and  assistance programs that help communities evaluate and remove  dams for both public safety and environmental reasons.  More than  52 dams have been removed in Pennsylvania since 1999. Wisconsin  communities have removed 39 dams since 1999. </p>
