<p>LOS ANGELES - December 12 - The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) today celebrates the record-breaking box office success for the opening weekend of <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, which bowed in five theaters in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco for a three-day box office take of $547,425, an average of $109,485 per screen. This is both the highest per-screen average for any film released in 2005, and the highest per-screen average ever for a live-action film, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.</p>

<p>"This is an astonishing accomplishment and a real testament to how this film is connecting with audiences," said GLAAD President Neil G. Giuliano. "<i>Brokeback Mountain</i> is truly a remarkable event, and its journey and impact are just beginning." Last week, GLAAD called the release of <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> a historic moment in film history. (Press release <a href="/media/release_detail.php?id=3842&PHPSESSID=97b205d754df27ecdcb811ed2a5839fb">available here</a>).</p>

<p>On Friday, December 16, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> opens in 21 additional markets on approximately 60 screens in cities such as Seattle, Detroit, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, and Washington DC.</p>

<p>On Saturday, December 10, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association named <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> the year's best movie and Ang Lee as the year's best director.</p>

<p>GLAAD is providing a Resource Guide for reporters covering <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, featuring updated nominations and awards for the film, key reviews, related articles and references to information on real-life gay cowboys and the rural gay experience. The <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> Resource Guide can be <a href="/eye/brokeback_mountain.php?PHPSESSID=97b205d754df27ecdcb811ed2a5839fb">accessed here</a>.</p>
