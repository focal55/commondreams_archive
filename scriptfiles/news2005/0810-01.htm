<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AMSTERDAM - August 8 - Greenpeace swimmers with flares and 
a buoy reading &quot;stop deep sea destruction&quot; clung to the bow of the 
Estonian flagged bottom trawler Lootus II in the foggy Northwest 
Atlantic protesting what is happening out of sight in international 
waters. Greenpeace is calling on governments to take action to stop the 
destruction of deep-sea life by bottom trawlers, particularly operators 
such as the Lootus II.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greenpeace ship Esperanza has been observing the Lootus II for 30 
hours, 18 of which she has been bottom trawling continuously, which is 
highly irregular. Greenpeace suspects that they are refusing to haul in 
their nets because they are being watched.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's a scandal that this boat is even permitted to bottom trawl here or 
anywhere. Not only does the Lootus II have an appalling record of 
breaking the rules here in the Northwest Atlantic, but its owners are 
connected with the illegal fishing of Patagonian toothfish in the 
Southern Ocean,&quot; said Bunny McDiarmid on board the Esperanza.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Lootus II has been cited seven times since 2000 for breaking NAFO 
(1) rules (2). The Estonian Company MFV Lootus OU is the registered 
owner of the Lootus II. In 2004 the Spanish company Grupo Oya Perez, 
through one of its subsidiaries became a shareholder of the Estonian 
company. Grupo Oya Perez is the owner of the notorious pirate Patagonian 
toothfish vessel, the Ross (3).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greenpeace is calling on Estonia and Spain to explain why it is allowing 
vessels, owned by a company with a criminal fishing history to continue 
fishing in the Northwest Atlantic management area also known as NAFO.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2003 and in 2004, the EU delegation to the NAFO meeting included 
three members from Grupo Oya Perez. The EU and NAFO must be aware that 
this company's fishing vessels have been involved in illegal toothfish 
fishing in southern waters, but despite this they are invited to 
participate in NAFO decisions on fisheries conservation matters and 
measures to deter Illegal, Unregulated and Unreporting (IUU) operations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Lootus II is the worst example of NAFO not working. Allowing IUU 
operators to sit at the table making decisions about fisheries 
management that their vessels will then simply ignore is like inviting 
the wolf into the chicken house&quot;, added McDiarmid.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Esperanza is in the NAFO area to highlight the destructive impact of 
bottom trawling in support of the call by more than 1,100 marine 
scientists and environmental organisations for a UN moratorium on 
high-seas bottom trawling. The Esperanza has observed 20 boats bottom 
trawling in the area from Japan, Spain, Estonia, Latvia, Canada, 
Lithuania, Iceland and Portugal and documented a number of these during 
their trawling and hauling operations. The next meeting of NAFO parties 
will take place in September 2005 in Tallinn, Estonia.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notes:<br>
1. Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) is a regional body 
designed to manage the fishing in international waters off the coast of 
Canada.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The Lootus II has been cited seven times since 2000 for NAFO 
violations including fishing for species under moratoria and exceeding 
by-catch regulations. The latest citation was December 2004.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. The Ross under a variety of names has been photographed illegally 
fishing for toothfish in the sub Antarctic in 2003 and again in 2005 
fishing in an area closed to fishing by CCAMLR (The Convention on the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources). The Ross is also on 
Norway's blacklist of fishing vessels.</font></p>
