<p>BAGHDAD - Amnesty International today called for greater attention to be paid to the needs of victims of violations under Saddam Hussein's rule when his trial resumes on 28 November 2005.

<p>Wesley Gryk, the legal expert heading a three-person team sent by Amnesty International to observe the trial, praised the presiding judge's decision to adjourn the hearing for 40 days to allow defence lawyers to prepare their case and to ensure that witnesses will be able to come forward to give testimonies in court without fear.

<p>"In the circumstances, it was entirely appropriate that the court should adjourn to give defense lawyers time to study the large volume of documentation which, somewhat inexplicably, was served on the defendants only shortly before the trial began. The tribunal's legitimacy will be judged by the fairness of the procedures it follows, including the extent to which it ensures full defence rights such as regular and confidential access to defendants. It is vital that this trial is conducted fairly, and is seen to be, as it will set the pattern for affording justice for many of the victims of crimes committed under the rule of Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath party," said Wesley Gryk.

<p>The needs of the victims, however, need to be given greater consideration when the trial reconvenes, according to Amnesty International's observer.

<p>"On the opening day, victims and their relatives were not able to be present in the court," said Wesley Gryk. "This is a deficiency that must be addressed. The court must ensure that at least some victims and their representatives can attend and observe the proceedings, and that relatives of the defendants can also be present if they wish. Ensuring security at a trial of this magnitude is important, but that should not be achieved at the cost of those who, through their personal suffering, have earned a right to be present to see justice done."

<p>Amnesty International remains particularly concerned about legislation prescribing that any death sentences imposed on Saddam Hussein and his co-accused would be carried out within 30 days of any appeal being rejected.

<p>"This is a very worrying concern and one which we urge the Iraqi government to review and overturn," said Wesley Gryk. "Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases on grounds of principle. Here, though, the execution of Saddam Hussein would also have the effect of denying justice to many victims of the crimes committed under his rule."
