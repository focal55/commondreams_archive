<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON - July 15 - In commemeration of all those who lost their lives in the London bombing last week and in an effort to prevent further loss of life, either in this country or abroad, the Stop the War Coalition and the Muslim Association of Britain are jointly organising a peace vigil this Sunday at 2pm in Russell Square, Bloomsbury, central London.</font></p><p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We utterly condemn those who take innocent life whether in Britain or Iraq&quot; said Lindsey German, the convener of the Stop the War Coalition. &quot;We have long argued, as did MI5, that the threat of terrorism would be worsened by the Iraq war. Sadly these fears have now been realised.&quot;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The blame for the loss of life in London lies with those who exploded the bombs, just as the loss of life in Iraq is the fault of those who ordered bombs to be dropped on that country. We must all work to end the cycle of violence.&quot;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The participation of the Muslim Association of Britain highlights fears of a backlash against the Muslim community. One man has been kicked to death in Nottingham with his murderers shouting 'Taliban' as they killed him. Mosques have been attacked across the country. Islamophobia has been used to justify the attack on Iraq and we are now seeing the price of such scapegoating.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The vigil will be a chance for Londoners to show that they are united for peace.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
