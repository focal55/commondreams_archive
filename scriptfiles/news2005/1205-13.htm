<p>	WASHINGTON - December 5 - As the security situation in 
Darfur, Sudan continues to deteriorate, there is a growing consensus 
around the need for a more robust mandate for the African Union (AU) 
mission and a larger international intervention force to support the AU 
and provide protection to the people of Darfur. Africa Action today 
declares that the United Nations (UN) is the appropriate vehicle for 
such an intervention, and that this is a viable option that should 
immediately be pursued by the international community.

<p>	Africa Action calls upon the U.S. to immediately introduce a resolution 
at the UN to "re-hat" the AU mission as a UN operation, granting it a 
strong civilian protection mandate from the international community, and 
to authorize a UN force to be deployed as soon as possible to the 
region. Based on African precedents, Africa Action asserts that such a 
UN action in support of the AU can and will provide critical support to 
the AU mission and provide security to the people of Darfur.

<p>	In this statement, Africa Action addresses the feasibility of such a UN 
intervention in Darfur. The organization offers new analysis of 
precedents where African regional bodies and the UN have cooperated 
effectively in peace enforcement and peacekeeping missions, and it 
applies lessons learned to recommend next steps on Darfur. Africa Action 
highlights the need for U.S. leadership at the UN to prompt such 
international action, and argues why this is the moment for such 
leadership to protect the people of Darfur.

<p>	An International Intervention is Necessary Now

<p>	Recent reports from the UN, humanitarian agencies and the media confirm 
a sharp deterioration in the security situation in Darfur. Already more 
than 400,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million have been forced 
out of their homes since the genocide began in 2003. As the violence 
worsens, growing numbers of people are being attacked and displaced, 
humanitarian organizations face increasing risks to their operations, 
and there are new demands for a protection force to provide security to 
the region. An international intervention is essential to serve four 
main purposes: (1) Stop the killings, rapes and pillaging in Darfur; (2) 
Provide security to facilitate humanitarian assistance programs for 
internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees; (3) Enforce the African 
Union cease-fire between the Khartoum government and the rebel groups in 
Darfur to allow meaningful political negotiations to move forward in 
Abuja, Nigeria, and (4) facilitate the voluntary return of IDPs to their 
land and the reconstruction of their homes by providing a secure 
environment.

<p>	As the 7th round of peace talks between the Government of Sudan and 
rebel groups from Darfur continues in Abuja, Nigeria, an international 
intervention is necessary to deter violence in Darfur and to help create 
the climate for these talks to proceed productively and result in a 
comprehensive agreement. Once a political agreement is reached in Abuja, 
an international intervention force will be essential to facilitate the 
implementation of such an agreement.

<p>	The African Union Needs UN Support

<p>	The African Union has demonstrated important leadership in Darfur - 
brokering the April 2004 cease-fire, deploying 7,000 troops to Darfur to 
observe the cease-fire, and hosting successive rounds of peace talks 
between the Government of Sudan and the rebels. Now the AU needs 
international support to ensure the success of its mission in Darfur, 
both for the sake of its institutional credibility and for the sake of 
millions of vulnerable people in Darfur. At present, the AU mission 
lacks the mandate, the troop strength and the logistical capacity to 
stop the genocide and provide protection to the people of Darfur.

<p>	Responding to genocide and other crimes against humanity is a 
responsibility of the international community. The UN must act to 
reinforce the AU’s efforts, as it has worked with African regional 
bodies in the past, to ensure the success of peacekeeping operations 
where the lives of millions of innocent civilians are at stake.

<p>	Precedents Prove Case for UN-African Peacekeeping Operation

<p>	Under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the Security Council may take such 
action as necessary to maintain or restore international peace and 
security. The members of the UN have previously shown their willingness 
and capability to invoke Chapter 7 peace enforcement and peace-building 
instruments in response to conflict in Africa. Now, the UN can and must 
furnish the AU with a strong civilian protection mandate and with 
international backing in the form of a UN peacekeeping mission to 
support the AU in Darfur.

<p>	Precedents show that the UN is a viable source for effective and 
appropriate international intervention to stop genocide and other crimes 
against humanity. The following examples also show instances of 
successful cooperation between African regional bodies, which intervened 
as "first responders", and the UN, which acted to reinforce their 
efforts with a larger international force.

<p>	(1) In Sierra Leone, after the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) intervened to enforce the peace in 1998, the UN Security 
Council acted in 1999 to authorize an international force with a robust 
mandate, under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, to work alongside and 
coordinate with the ECOWAS mission. In late 1999, ECOWAS troops in 
Sierra Leone were "re-hatted" as UN peacekeepers, and transitioned into 
a UN mission the next year. The transition in early 2000 was initially 
rocky, but the Security Council rallied behind the mission and boosted 
its strength, and the mission was able to deter conflict and restore a 
secure environment to Sierra Leone.

<p>	(2) In Liberia, ECOWAS intervened to enforce the peace in 2003, and in 
August of that year it was granted the authority and mandate by the UN 
Security Council, under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, to establish 
security and facilitate humanitarian assistance in Liberia and to pave 
the way for a UN intervention. The UN Security Council acted swiftly and 
decisively to authorize and deploy (within 2 months) a larger 
multinational intervention in Liberia. The ECOWAS troops acted as the 
first contingent of the UN mission to Liberia, and authority was 
successfully transferred to the UN operation in October 2003. This 
international operation has been successful in promoting peace and 
stability in Liberia.

<p>	(3) In Côte d’Ivoire, the UN Security Council granted authority to 
ECOWAS and to France in 2003 to take the necessary steps to provide 
security and protection in Côte d’Ivoire. In 2004, a UN operation was 
authorized to take over from the ECOWAS force and work alongside the 
French forces to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreement 
and to provide protection in Côte d’Ivoire.

<p>	(4) In Burundi, the AU authorized and deployed its first peacekeeping 
operation in 2003, when the institution was itself only one year old. 
The AU operation in Burundi faced financial and logistical challenges, 
but it was able to oversee the cease-fire and provide some stability. It 
coordinated with the UN to ensure a relatively smooth transition to a UN 
operation in Burundi after one year.

<p>	Also under a Chapter 7 mandate, the UN already has a precedent of 
authorizing and deploying a peacekeeping operation in southern Sudan. In 
March 2005, the UN passed a resolution establishing a UN mission in 
Sudan (UNMIS) with up to 10,000 personnel and a mandate to support the 
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. At present, UNMIS 
comprises some 4,000 troops from more than 50 countries, the majority of 
which are outside the African continent.

<p>	These examples illustrate several important lessons, which must now be 
applied to a UN intervention in support of the AU mission in Darfur. 
First and foremost, these precedents reveal that a UN-authorized Chapter 
7 intervention force in support of an African-led force can be effective 
in providing security and protection. They show that the Security 
Council can act with swiftness and decisiveness to grant a robust 
mandate and troop strength to protect civilians, and they highlight that 
such an intervention can act as a deterrent to violence and as a 
catalyst to make a peace process successful.

<p>	Lessons Learned for Darfur

<p>	(1) "Re-hat" the African Union troops as UN troops:

<p>	The initial step of "re-hatting" African troops as UN troops carries 
several important benefits, and this must immediately be pursued to 
reinforce the AU mission in Darfur. Turning the AU troops into UN 'blue 
helmets' will save time on deployment, since these troops are already in 
the theater, pending the deployment of a larger UN force. It will help 
to retain the AU’s valuable experience on the ground, where these troops 
have already been carrying out important work. The act of granting a UN 
mandate to African troops will also provide them with international 
authority and backing, which can offer an important boost to the troops 
themselves and can help increase the confidence of civilians in Darfur 
in the AU operation because of the broader international support. 
Certainly, the act of "re-hatting" the AU will also require careful 
preparation, to ensure that the troops are ready to accept their new 
mandate, and the rules of engagement and standards which accompany it, 
but this has worked in the past and must be immediately pursued in Darfur.

<p>	(2) Deploy a UN intervention force:

<p>	The deployment of a UN intervention force to support the AU mission must 
follow swiftly, and this force should comprise at least 20,000 troops 
from the international community. This number is recommended by various 
sources based either on the ratio of peacekeeping troops to population 
or on the ratio of peacekeeping troops to hostile forces in Darfur. The 
deployment of this UN force must be well planned and coordinated with 
the African Union at every level and it must be well timed. Such 
coordination will be imperative whether the UN operation deploys 
alongside the AU or whether it ultimately assumes authority for the 
mission in Darfur. Consideration may also be given to the use of forces 
from UNMIS (in southern Sudan) for a UN mission in Darfur.

<p>	These examples illustrate that, while such a UN mission in Darfur is a 
potentially complex undertaking, it is perfectly possible, and morally 
and politically imperative, for an international intervention to be 
successful in promoting peace and security in Darfur, as has been the 
case elsewhere.

<p>	The U.S. Must Lead UN Action

<p>	In order for a UN mandate and intervention to be authorized by the 
Security Council, under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, there must be 
leadership from within the Security Council from a powerful nation with 
the political will and the resources to galvanize international support 
for this mission. This leadership must come from the U.S. for several 
reasons.

<p>	The U.S. is the only government to have declared that genocide is taking 
place in Darfur, and this provides it with a unique obligation to obtain 
international action on this crisis. The U.S. earlier prompted the UN to 
undertake an inquiry into the crisis in Darfur, and though the 
politically-comprised conclusion of the Commission of Inquiry failed to 
find genocidal intent on the part of the Sudanese government, the report 
confirmed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, and named 
civilian protection as an urgent priority. Other governments have failed 
to take a public position on what is happening in Darfur, but there is 
broad international recognition of ongoing war crimes and crimes against 
humanity in western Sudan.

<p>	The U.S. has previously offered leadership on Darfur at the Security 
Council, authoring earlier resolutions condemning the violence in 
Darfur, threatening sanctions and calling on the Government of Sudan to 
stop the violence. But the U.S. has yet to call for an urgent 
international intervention to protect the people of Darfur. In the 15 
months since the U.S. declared that genocide was taking place in Darfur, 
the U.S. has offered financial support for humanitarian efforts in 
Darfur, and U.S. officials have traveled back and forth to the region. 
But these limited actions cannot substitute for assertive international 
leadership to provide actual protection to the people of Darfur.

<p>	Possible Challenges in the Security Council

<p>	It is possible that the Security Council will not agree to intervene in 
Darfur even with U.S. leadership, because of the economic and diplomatic 
interests of some of the Permanent Members. China is the single largest 
investor in Sudan’s oil sector, and Russia is Khartoum’s major arms 
supplier. Neither one of these nations is in favor of the principle of 
intervention in the "internal affairs" of another state on the ground of 
human rights abuses. But a resolution on intervention could still pass 
the Security Council, as happened in March 2005 when the Security 
Council voted to refer war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur 
to the International Criminal Court (ICC), and opposing nations 
abstained but did not veto the resolution.

<p>	These possible blocks offer no excuse for U.S. hesitation or inaction. 
The U.S. must discharge its own responsibility to act, first and 
foremost. It must issue the challenge to these nations by introducing a 
resolution calling for UN intervention in Darfur, and it must be willing 
to expend the necessary diplomatic capital to overcome their objections 
to a multinational force to stop the genocide. The U.S. has called the 
crisis in Darfur "genocide", and must have the courage of its 
convictions to bring this matter to the international community for 
immediate action, with a priority on civilian protection in Darfur. To 
fail to do so exposes a racial double standard, which this 
Administration can ill afford to maintain.

<p>	Africa Action Demands

<p>	In February 2006, the U.S. will hold the presidency of the United 
Nations Security Council for the period of one month. Between now and 
then, the U.S. must work within the UN to pave the way for the adoption 
of a new resolution on Darfur. In February, as President of the Security 
Council, the U.S. will have a unique opportunity and obligation to 
preside over the adoption of a resolution granting a robust civilian 
protection mandate to the African Union mission in Darfur and 
authorizing a broader UN intervention force to be deployed as soon as 
possible to support the AU effort.

<p>	The introduction and adoption of such a UN resolution is critical to the 
success of the AU in Darfur, and it is essential to save the lives of 
hundreds and thousands of vulnerable people, who urgently need 
protection from the international community. The Bush Administration 
faces growing public pressure for action to stop the genocide in Darfur. 
By acting now to introduce a resolution at the UN to re-hat the AU as a 
UN operation and deploy a complementary international force, the U.S. 
government would fulfill these calls for leadership in the face of genocide.
