<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, DC &#151; Amnesty International today applauded the introduction by Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) of a bill to establish an independent commission to investigate detainee abuses in Guantanamo, Iraq, Afghanistan and other locations.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress should seize this opportunity to support a comprehensive, transparent and independent investigation into the policies and practices governing treatment of detainees,&quot; said Jumana Musa, Advocacy Director for Domestic Human Rights and International Justice at Amnesty International USA.  &quot;A thorough examination of the detention centers and interrogation techniques will provide Congress with the information necessary for proper oversight of the treatment of detainees and will be a significant step towards ensuring that all detained individuals are treated in accordance with U.S. and international law.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abundant evidence has emerged to suggest that far from being a few isolated incidents, the policies deliberately created, justified and promulgated by the Administration resulted in systemic abuses.  Limited prosecution of low-ranking servicemembers will not curtail the potential for further abuses, and only by exposing the decisions and directives that laid the foundation of the torture scandal will the United States regain its reputation for respecting and upholding human rights.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International urges the Administration to publicly support the establishment of the independent commission and commit to unqualified cooperation with its investigation.  The Administration should also immediately end all secret and incommunicado detentions; grant the International Committee of the Red Cross full access to all detainees including those held in secret locations; ensure recourse to the law for all detainees; and bring to justice anyone responsible for authorizing or committing human rights violations.</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
