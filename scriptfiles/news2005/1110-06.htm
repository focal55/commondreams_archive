<p>WASHINGTON - November 10 - The Congressional NEPA Task Force brought its controversial series of hearings on the National Environmental Policy Act to Capitol Hill today to hear testimonies from varied interests as to whether to weaken the bedrock protection for safe and healthy communities. Today's hearing was to focus specifically on NEPA litigation, including lawsuits on levees and grazing. The Task Force, which was formed by House Resources Chairman Richard Pombo (R-CA), previously held field hearings in Spokane, WA; Lakeside, AZ; Rio Rancho, NM; Nagodoches, TX; and Norfolk, VA. It is scheduled to complete the hearings next Thursday in D.C. with a report expected in the coming weeks.

<p>"The National Environmental Policy Act is one of America's great success stories," said Debbie Sease, Sierra Club Legislative Director, who testified at today's hearing. "It is a law that when properly implemented saves time and money in the long run by reducing controversy, building consensus, and ensuring that a project is done right the first time."

<p>The 35-year old National Environmental Policy Act, signed into law by President Nixon, safeguards our nation's air, water, and lands by requiring federal agencies to provide an assessment of the environmental impact of and alternatives to any major federal action that could significantly affect the quality of the environment.  However, there are some in Congress who want to curtail NEPA's environmental review process and public participation in the name of speeding up potentially damaging projects.

<p>"There is no need to overhaul NEPA because it works. It protects and empowers the public," said Sease. "Limiting public involvement and weakening environmental review won't avoid controversy or improve projects. It will only weaken our participatory democracy."

<p>The field hearings themselves invited controversy when several of the hearing venues were changed at the last minute, moving from centrally located population centers to more isolated communities, in some cases even changing from weekend to weekday schedules. In some cases proponents of NEPA were denied an opportunity to offer testimony.  For example, the third hearing on July 23rd intended to cover the role of NEPA in the southern states, was moved from Houston, Texas (population 1,953,000) to the small east Texas town of Nacogdoches (population 30,000).  Eight of the 10 witnesses represented mining and timber extractive industries. Local Sierra Club members asked to testify at the hearing but were turned down. Sierra Club representatives testified at the Norfolk, Virginia, hearing and today in Washington, D.C.

<p>"NEPA is based on that lesson we all learned as kids - 'look before you leap," said Sease. "It's just common sense to think ahead about the consequences of the actions we take."
