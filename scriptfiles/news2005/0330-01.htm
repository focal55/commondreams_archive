<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 30 -- Shujaa Granham, Russell Neufeld, Robert Meerpool, Holly Richardson, with Moderator Annie Zirin, created a great panel on stopping the death penalty and jail expansion. A standing room only audience of 100 people &shy; many activists &shy; participated in this event.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Panelists and audience members discussed important issues on these topics, such as the utter inability of any government to come up with a foolproof death penalty statute, and the victimization of women (not to mention their families) and immigrants in incarceration and jail expansion plans.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We gratefully acknowledge the help of Ed Russell of Active Ingredients. Our recording device had a glitch and Ed came to the rescue. He provided edited audio files. We did some minor editing and formatted the files to mp3&sup1;s &shy; suitable for download and radio airplay. We also made RealAudio versions for our friends with slower dialup connections.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More Background (we thank whoever came up with these little bios)</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Annie E.
