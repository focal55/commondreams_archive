<p> MAP TA PHUT, Thailand - December 9 - Three Greenpeace crew members 
from the organisation's flagship the Rainbow Warrior today were dropped 
into the Map Ta Phut port waters after BLCP coal plant staff cut the 
ship's mooring lines while police refused to intervene. Plant personnel 
had arrived with cutting equipment.  The crew peacefully resisted by 
hanging from the mooring lines. 

<p>The Rainbow Warrior has spent the past two days alongside the pier as 
part of a campaign to bear witness to the climate killing impact of BLCP 
and the Thai Government's plans to open at least 18 further coal plants 
in the next decade.

<p>"Greenpeace and the Rainbow Warrior have always participated in peaceful 
non-violent protest," said Greenpeace International spokesperson Jean 
Francois Fauconnier aboard The Rainbow Warrior. "We condemn this 
aggressive act which placed the ship and lives at risk."

<p>"For two days we have called on both the plant's management and the Thai 
energy minister to respond to our demands. Greenpeace wants the  
construction of this plant stopped and a thorough review of the Thai 
Government's coal-driven energy plan to be undertaken."

<p>"Coal plants like BLCP are guilty of causing climate change. Greenpeace 
will continue to expose those who continue to fund and promote dangerous 
energies like coal instead of looking at cleaner options like wind and 
solar power. Our climate simply can't wait."

<p>On Tuesday, with the Rainbow Warrior looking on, four climbers unfurled 
banners saying "BLCP, Climate Killer" on the plant's coal unloading 
cranes. Later that day activists and volunteers set up a first camp 
outside the main gate of the BLCP coal power plant. Today a second camp 
was installed on one of the BLCP coal plant's 60-metre electrical 
transmission pylons. The seven activists have decorated the tower with 
banners relaying messages from cyber activists and miniature windmills 
as symbols of renewable energy.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to drive solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
