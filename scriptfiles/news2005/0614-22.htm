<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON, DC--Citing public safety, National Park Service 
  officials are inviting telecommunication companies to erect cell towers on national 
  park lands, according to agency documents released today by Public Employees 
  for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). Some of the nation&#8217;s oldest and 
  wildest parks, such as Yellowstone, are already approaching universal cell coverage.</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Even as it asks visitors to commune with nature, the Park Service is 
  ensuring that no visitor will be beyond the reach of electronic tethers and 
  the ubiquitous chirp of the cell phone,&#8221; stated PEER Executive Director 
  Jeff Ruch, noting that only one of the 388 national park units, the Golden Gate 
  National Recreation Area, has a plan governing placement of cell phone towers; 
  in all the other parks, the telecom company picks the tower location. &#8220;With 
  no national debate and almost zero public input, our national parks are simply 
  giving away whatever solitude and serenity remains.&#8221;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With each passing month, competing telecom companies seek to fill in &#8220;dead 
  zones&#8221; within our parks &#8211;</font></p><ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, straddling the Pennsylvania 
    and New Jersey shores of the Delaware River, has eight applications for cell 
    phone towers within its boundaries from competing telecom companies;</font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yellowstone National Park, which already has five cell towers that provide 
    coverage over most of the park, is considering overtures for as many as three 
    other towers. While Yellowstone officials announced two years ago that it 
    would develop an &#8220;antenna management plan,&#8221; but, to date, its 
    planning process has been closed to the public; and</font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Kentucky&#8217;s Mammoth Cave National Park, with the world&#8217;s most 
    extensive cave system, recently approved an application by Bluegrass Cellular 
    to construct a 180-foot cell tower that will extend cell coverage to many 
    parts of the backcountry, including some Wilderness Study Areas. </font></li></ul><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Invoking public safety concerns, officials in many parks are welcoming cell 
  towers as a way for visitors and their own staff to communicate. The proof behind 
  these public safety arguments, however, is elusive. Ironically, none of these 
  parks raised any public safety worries until recently, after telecommunication 
  companies approached them. Not surprisingly, this telecom-public safety rationale 
  dictates that every part of a national park, especially remote, wild areas, 
  requires cell phone coverage.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;Can You Hear Me Now?&#8217; is rapidly becoming the new slogan 
  for our national park system,&#8221; Ruch added. &#8220;The telecom companies 
  are not erecting towers to protect public safety but to make a buck. If the 
  National Park Service is truly concerned that its visitors are unsafe without 
  cell phones, perhaps they should start providing phones at the entrance gates.&#8221;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="../docs/nps/05_14_6_map.pdf">Look
