<p>WASHINGTON - The Campaign for  America's Future today sent a letter to all the Republican  lawmakers whose campaigns received money from former House  Majority Leader Tom DeLay's political action committee, Americans  for a Republican Majority PAC. Rep. Delay's indictment last week  led to his resignation from House leadership.</p>
<p>   The letter, signed by Campaign for America's Future deputy  director Ellen Miller, asks 247 of those U.S. representatives to  "contribute the same amount of money you received from ARMPAC to  the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund. We have enclosed an envelope for  your convenience."</p>
<p>   In the letter, the Campaign for America's Future referenced  the actions of Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo., who contributed the  same amount of money he had received from ARMPAC to the Bush- Clinton Katrina Fund.</p>
<p>   "Washington is engulfed in corruption," Miller said. "From  DeLay to Frist to the potential indictments of key White House  officials, this town is a scandalous swamp. It's time for members  of Congress to stand with the people and show that, in this time  of great national need, the charity chests are more important  than political war chests."</p>
<p>   Twenty-six of the 247 lawmakers targeted received the maximum  contribution allowed from Rep. DeLay's political action committee  this election cycle. Those 26 members are Rep. Bob Beauprez, R- Colo., Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas; Rep. Charles Boustany Jr, R- La.; Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.; Rep. Chris Chocola, R- Ind.; Rep. Geoff Davis, R-Ky.; Rep. Charles Wieder Dent, R-Pa.;  Rep. Michael Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; Rep. Jeffrey Fortenberry, R- Neb.; Rep. Jim Gerlach, R-Pa.; Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C.; Rep.  John Kuhl Jr, R-N.Y.; Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, R-Colo.; Rep. Anne  Northup, R-Ky.; Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash.; Rep. Rick Renzi, R- Ariz.; Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala.; Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio; Rep.  Joe Schwarz, R-Mich.; Rep. Rob Simmons, R-Conn.; Rep. Michael  Sodrel, R-Ind.; and Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M</p>
