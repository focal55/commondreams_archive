<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 13 - Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) led all of her colleagues in first-quarter fundraising from 14 out of the top 50 industries ranked by campaign giving to members of Congress, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With reports detailing campaign fundraising in the second quarter of the year due to be filed later this week, the Center has posted money-in-politics profiles for the 2006 cycle of dozens of industries making up the U.S. economy. The profiles, which also include contributions to the national political parties, go back to the 1990 election cycle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinton raised more than any other member of the Senate or House from each of the four most generous industries to lawmakers in the first quarter of this year: lawyers and law firms, real estate interests, doctors and other health professionals and persons describing themselves as retired.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 14 industries from which Clinton raised the most money, nine contributed more in individual and PAC donations to Republican lawmakers than to Democrats between January and March. They include traditionally Republican-leaning industries such as health professionals, retail sales and health services/HMOs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinton, who faces a reelection battle next year and is frequently mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2008, raised a total of more than $3.9 million in the first quarter of this year and reported having $8.7 million in the bank.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After Clinton, the lawmaker leading in fundraising from the most industries is Sen. George Allen (R-Va.). Allen, who is also up for reelection in 2006 and is reported to have presidential aspirations, led the pack in fundraising from five industries: lobbyists, auto makers and dealers, the food and beverage industry, finance/credit companies and tobacco interests. Each of those industries contributed more to Republican lawmakers than to Democrats in the first quarter.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) raised more money than anyone else from four industries: insurance firms, the pharmaceuticals and health products industry, manufacturing and distributing companies and the providers of agricultural services and products. Like Clinton and Allen, Santorum is running for reelection next year and is a possible future presidential contender.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The highest House member on the list is Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), who led all other lawmakers in fundraising from three<br>industries: building trade unions, candidate committees and miscellaneous unions. Matsui raised $1.1 million in winning a special election in March to succeed her late husband.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, people listing themselves as retired, a group the Center classifies as an industry, have given more campaign money to federal candidates and political parties combined than has any other group in the 2006 election cycle so far. They have contributed a total of $8.5 million this year, 63 percent to Republicans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The retired also were No. 1 in total industry giving during the 2004 election cycle, when they contributed a record $184.1 million. That marked the first time retired people topped the list of industries after years at No. 2, behind lawyers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 2004 cycle also marked the most significant period of giving from the retired to Democratic candidates and party committees. Democrats collected 46 percent of the money contributed by retired donors for last year's elections, a significantly higher proportion than in other election cycles. Since 1989, the retired have contributed a total of $538.6 million, 36 percent to Democrats and 63 percent to the GOP. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second largest campaign donor in the current cycle so far is the legal profession, which has contributed $6.4 million in individual and PAC contributions to federal candidates and parties, 66 percent to Democrats. The industry also was No. 2 for the 2004 cycle after several cycles in the top spot.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lawyers and law firms are still No. 1 in total contributions since 1999, with $660.1 million donated, 72 percent to Democrats.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This report, with relevant links, is available at &lt;<a href="http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=176" target="_new">http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=176</a>&gt;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A list of top recipients from the most generous industries to lawmakers is available at &lt;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.asp" target="_new">http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.asp</a>&gt;.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center's industry profiles are available at &lt;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/index.asp" target="_new">http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/index.asp</a>&gt;.</font><br></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
