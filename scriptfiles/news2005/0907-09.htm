<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 7 - In a letter delivered today to the leadership of the U.S. 
Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, twenty-one business, 
environmental, and energy policy organizations from across the United States 
called upon Congress to return to the drawing board and develop a new energy 
bill.

<p>Citing "oil prices now topping $70/barrel and gasoline over $3/gallon, 
energy imports that continue to rise, the war in Iraq, and the devastation 
caused by Hurricane Katrina - the intensity of which was exacerbated by 
climate change," the letter notes that "few in Congress would argue that the 
recently enacted Energy Policy Act of 2005 will have any near-term impact on 
energy prices, energy imports, the emission of greenhouse gases, or national 
security."

<p>"Congress cannot afford to wait another decade before addressing our growing 
energy problems," the organizations argue.  "Given the multiple threats now 
posed to the nation's economy, environmental health, and national security, 
Congress arguably cannot even wait until the next session.  Now is the time 
to act on an energy policy that seriously addresses the challenges now 
facing the country."

<p>Among the letter's recommendations are:

<p>"It is imperative that Congress enacts aggressive fuel efficiency standards 
for automobiles and trucks - at a bare minimum, CAFE standards for cars and 
light trucks should be no less than 40 mpg by 2015 and arguably 
substantially higher;

<p>"Congress should enact a mandatory target for an overall national reduction 
in the level of oil consumption set at a level equivalent to at least 10 
percent of the current level of petroleum use within the next five years 
with more stringent targets to follow;

<p>"The nation must set mandatory limits on the production of greenhouse gases 
that do not merely curb the intensity of carbon dioxide, methane, and other 
emissions but actually reduce their levels significantly;

<p>"Congress needs to provide both long-term tax incentives for the 
cross-section of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and 
substantially higher authorization levels for research, development, and 
deployment programs;

<p>"Congress should enact a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to require the 
nation's power generators to produce a substantial portion of their 
electricity from renewable sources - we suggest that the level be no less 
than 20% by 2020; and

<p>"Congress roll back many, if not all, of the incentives provided in the 
energy bill to the mature and well-financed nuclear and fossil fuel 
industries -- the latter of which is currently making breathtaking profits."
