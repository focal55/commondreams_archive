<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -- February 16 -- Black Same-Sex Households in the United States: A Report from the 2000 Census and a new Chicago fact sheet is available at <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/library" target="_new">http://www.thetaskforce.org/library</a>.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This groundbreaking report demonstrates that gays and lesbians are woven into African/ American communities wherever we are. Gay African/Americans don't live in just Atlanta and Chicago; we live everywhere in America where you find African/Americans.&quot;<br>     <b>&#151; H. Alexander Robinson, Strategic Director of the National Black Justice Coalition</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This study demonstrates the strength and struggle of Black same-sex families in Chicago. As we celebrate Black History Month, we must carry on the legacies of African-American gay leaders, Bayard Rustin, Audre Lourde and James Baldwin. We must fight as they did to break down the matrix of discrimination based on race, class, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&quot;<br><b>&#151;Matt Foreman, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director</b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Washington D.C. February 2005. Based on an in-depth analysis of 2000 Census data, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute said today that Black lesbian households in Chicago are almost as likely as Black married opposite-sex couple households to include children and are twice as likely to report serving in the military; that Black same-sex couples are more likely to work in the public sector, and that they earn less than married Black couples in the Windy City and significantly less than White gay or lesbian couples.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result of these and other factors, Black same-sex couples have more to gain from legal recognition of their relationships and more to lose when states pass amendments banning marriage and other forms of partner recognition. The analysis was released in conjunction with the celebration of Black History Month.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Chicago-specific analysis is a supplement to the groundbreaking study, Black Same-Sex Households in the United States: a Report from the 2000 Census, released in October by the Task Force Policy Institute and the National Black Coalition.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chicago ranks third among U.S. cities in number of Black same-sex households, behind New York and Atlanta and ahead of Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington/Baltimore.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The analysis reveals the following important and sometimes startling facts about Black same-sex couples in Chicago</font></p><ul><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     Black female same-sex households in Chicago parent at rates comparable to Black married opposite-sex couple households. Nearly three in five Black female same-sex households in Chicago (59%) have at least one child. Seventy percent of Black married opposite-sex couple households have at least one child.</font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     Black same-sex couples in Chicago earn nearly $15,000 less per year than Black married opposite-sex couples, and more than $30,000 less than White same-sex couples in Chicago.</font><br></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Individuals in Black same-sex households in Chicago work in the public sector at a higher rate than those in White same-sex households (16% vs. 10%). Chicago does not offer domestic partner benefits to city employees. Consequently, Black same-sex couples not only make less money than their White counterparts, but also have less access to healthcare benefits.<br></font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Despite receiving no government benefits or protections for their relationships, Black same-sex couples in Chicago are almost as likely as Black married opposite-sex couples (57% vs. 63%) to report living in the same residence as five years earlier, a key indicator of relationship stability.<br></font></li><li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Black women in same-sex households in Chicago report serving in the military at twice the rate of Black women in married opposite-sex households (4% vs. 2%). Nationally, Black women are discharged under the militarys ban on lesbian and gay service members at rates far exceeding their representation in the armed forces: although they make up less than 1% of the military, they represent 3% of all discharges.</font></li></ul><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commenting on the findings, H. Alexander Robinson, Strategic Director of the National Black Justice Coalition states, &quot;Anti-gay leaders and organizations have long sought to divide the Black and gay communities, speaking as if there are no Black lesbian and gay people experiencing discrimination under key family policies. In fact, this study clearly identifies a large population of Black same-sex couples in the U.S., more than half of whom are raising children. These families should be offered the same protections and opportunities to benefit from state and federal programs designed to promote family formation, stability, home ownership, and other values that contribute to community strength and the common good.&quot;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Black Same-Sex Households in the United States: A Report from the 2000 Census was written by Alain Dang and Somjen Frazer.

We work to build the grassroots political strength of our community by training state and local activists and leaders, working to strengthen the infrastructure of state and local allies, and organizing broad-based campaigns to build public support for complete equality for LGBT people. Our Policy Institute, the community's premiere think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a world that respects and makes visible the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. Headquartered in Washington, DC, we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, and Cambridge. The Task Force is a 501(c)(3) corporation incorporated in Washington, DC.

We also analyze and report on the positions of candidates for public office on issues of importance to the LGBT community. NGLTF, Inc. is a 501(c)(4) non-profit corporation incorporated in New York.
