<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - Lower and middle-income communities experience higher military enlistment rates than higher income areas, according to a new analysis released today by the non-partisan National Priorities Project (NPP).  

 <p>   This analysis is a result of an expanded NPP Database which now includes 2004 military recruitment numbers for different branches of the armed services broken down by high school, zip code, county and state.  Data is also available by race/ethnicity and gender.  A snapshot analysis and overview of the military recruitment data, which includes charts and tables, is at www.nationalpriorities.org/militaryrecruitment.   To find information on a particular high school, county, zip code or state, go to www.nationalpriorities.org/database.   

 <p>   Using census data on the average income level of zip codes, combined with data on 2004 military enlistment obtained by Peacework Magazine through the Freedom of Information Act, NPP's analyses highlight the disproportionate impact of military recruitment on lower and middle-income communities.

 <p>   "As the Iraq War continues and the number of soldiers killed and wounded mounts, this data makes clear that low- and middle-income kids are paying the highest price," said Greg Speeter, executive director of the National Priorities Project.  "It's young people with limited opportunities that are putting their lives on the line."

 <p>   The new data shows:

<ul>
<li>The highest recruitment rates -- defined as the number of recruits per thousand of 18-24 year-old population -- were found in counties that were relatively poorer than the rest of the nation.  All of the top 20 counties had median household incomes below the national level, and 19 of the 20 had median household incomes below their respective state level.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The three largest schools or programs in the country from which recruits are drawn include the GED Test Center in the New York State Education Department, the Gary Job Corps Center in San Marcos, Texas and another GED-based program in New York.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Montana -- a state with low median household income and high poverty rates -- led the country in state recruitment rates.  Rhode Island was at the bottom.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> High-income neighborhoods are under-represented.  Low- and middle-income neighborhoods are under-represented.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>  "Parents, students and concerned activists by the thousands have voiced their concerns in recent months about military recruitment tactics," said Sam Diener, Co-Editor of Peacework Magazine at the American Friends Service Committee New England Regional Office.  "Now, the NPP Database will be used to help people focus their efforts on the states, counties, zip code and schools most heavily impacted by military recruitment."

  <p>  The National Priorities Project is a national, non-partisan organization that illustrates the impact of federal policies on local communities.
