<p>October 31 - It is ironic that on the day we remember civil rights hero Rosa Parks in Washington, President Bush rejected an opportunity to unite our country with a nominee to the Supreme Court who could help bridge the difficult divides of race and class and politics in America today. Instead, he catered to the demands of the far right wing of his party&mdash;a decision guaranteed to spark a fight over the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. 
<P>And President Bush squandered an opportunity to bring greater diversity to the Supreme Court by choosing a woman or a person of color for this seat. </P><P>On issues of equality, workers&rsquo; rights and the power of our elected representatives in Congress to improve Americans&rsquo; lives, Judge Samuel Alito has repeatedly put basic rights at risk. </P><P>It is critical that senators of both parties thoroughly scrutinize Judge Alito&rsquo;s record and views on the rights of working people in order to evaluate his suitability for a lifetime appointment to the nation&rsquo;s highest court. The Supreme Court hears and decides cases involving crucially important rights and protections&mdash;from the right to a safe workplace to minimum wages, family leave, freedom from discrimination and the right to form and join a union. It is imperative that any nominee to the nation&rsquo;s highest court approach cases with an open mind free of ideological bias or agenda, and with understanding and respect for the hard-fought gains workers have won in the legislature, in the executive branch and in the courts. </P>
