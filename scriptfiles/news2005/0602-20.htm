<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON -- June 2 --In a report released today, Dr. Jeffrey 
Miron, visiting professor of economics at Harvard University, 
estimates that replacing marijuana prohibition with a system of 
taxation and regulation similar to that used for alcoholic beverages 
would produce combined savings and tax revenues of between $10 billion 
and $14 billion per year. In response, a group of more than 500 
distinguished economists -- led by Nobel Prize-winner Dr. Milton 
Friedman -- released an open letter to President Bush and other public officials calling for "an open and honest debate about marijuana 
prohibition," adding, "We believe such a debate will favor a regime 
in which marijuana is legal but taxed and regulated like other goods."

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Using data from a variety of federal and state government sources, Miron's paper, "The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition," 
concludes:

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> **Replacing marijuana prohibition with a system of legal 
regulation would save approximately $7.7 billion in government 
expenditures on prohibition enforcement-$2.4 billion at the federal 
level and $5.3 billion at the state and local levels.

  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  **Revenue from taxation of marijuana sales would range from $2.4 
billion per year if marijuana were taxed like ordinary consumer goods 
to $6.2 billion if it were taxed like alcohol or tobacco.

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  These estimates may be conservative. Because available data is 
incomplete, assumptions necessary to produce national estimates 
inevitably allow for some variation up or down. For example, Miron's 
report does not include estimates for certain potential savings -- such 
as the likelihood of fewer criminal justice referrals of marijuana 
offenders to drug treatment and reduced prison costs stemming from 
persons on parole or probation being reincarcerated after positive 
urine tests for marijuana. In addition, Miron based his figure for 
corrections costs stemming from marijuana prohibition on an estimate 
that one percent of state prisoners are imprisoned for marijuana- related offenses. A report released May 18 by the White House Office 
of National Drug Control Policy put the figure at 1.6 percent, 
acknowledging that tens of thousands of Americans are incarcerated 
in state or federal prisons for marijuana offenses.

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  While Miron notes that many factors beyond costs and tax revenues 
would need to be considered in evaluating possible changes in 
marijuana laws, he said, "These budgetary impacts should be included 
in any rational debate about marijuana policy."

   </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Those impacts are considerable, according to officials of the 
Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. For example, $14 billion 
in annual combined annual savings and revenues would cover the 
securing of all "loose nukes" in the former Soviet Union (estimated 
by former Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb at $30 billion) 
in less than three years. Just one year's savings would cover the full 
cost of anti-terrorism port security measures required by the Maritime 
Transportation Security Act of 2002. The Coast Guard has estimated 
these costs, covering 3,150 port facilities and 9,200 vessels, at 
$7.3 billion total.

   </font><p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As Milton Friedman and over 500 economists have now said, it's 
time for a serious debate about whether marijuana prohibition makes 
any sense," said Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana 
Policy Project in Washington, D.C. "We know that prohibition hasn't 
kept marijuana away from kids, since year after year 85% of high 
school seniors tell government survey-takers that marijuana is 'easy 
to get.' Conservatives, especially, are beginning to ask whether we're 
getting our money's worth or simply throwing away billions of tax 
dollars that might be used to protect America from real threats like 
those unsecured Soviet-era nukes."
