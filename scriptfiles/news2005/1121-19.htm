<p>ST. PETERSBURG - November 21 - Officials from more than 40 European 
and North Asian governments will gather for the first time in St. 
Petersburg, Russia today to discuss a plan of action to tackle the 
problem of corruption, illegal logging and the trade in illegally logged 
wood products in the region. Ministers will launch the plan on Friday, 
25 November.

<p>This is the latest in a series of initiatives around the world to 
address poor forest governance, weak law enforcement and the lack of 
laws to prevent products made from illegally logged wood being freely 
available on the global market. Illegal and destructive logging is 
having devastating impacts on the livelihoods of indigenous and local 
communities worldwide and on the biodiversity in the world's last 
ancient forests, including those in Eurasia.

<p>"Every day that bureaucrats avoid taking action to protect the world's 
last ancient forests, a forest area greater than the size of St. 
Petersburg is destroyed. Governments have the chance to save Eurasia's 
ancient forests this week. It's vital they take tough action and stop 
auctioning our last ancient forests, the heart of the planet, to the 
lowest bidder," said Alexey Yaroshenko, Greenpeace Russia forest campaigner.

<p>The host nation, Russia is home to 22% of the world's remaining forests 
and produces the most timber in the European and North Asian region. 
Recent estimates indicate that between six and nine out of every ten 
logs are from trees that have been cut down illegally (1). Countries 
that import and sell products made from illegal timber include China, 
Japan, the US and the EU, which is the largest importer of logs from 
Russia and accountable for nearly half of Russia's plywood exports (2).

<p>Greenpeace is urging governments to commit to domestic, regional and 
international measures to eliminate corruption and bribery, promote 
greater cooperation to improve law enforcement and to stem the market 
demand for illegal timber.

<p>To achieve this, countries that produce timber, such as Russia, must 
ensure that their domestic policies and regulations promote sustainable 
and legal forest management, which recognizes and protects the right of 
local and indigenous peoples.  Countries that buy illegally or 
destructively logged timber products must outlaw this trade and ensure 
the timber and timber products they buy come from sustainable sources.

<p>"Unless this week's plan develops and enforces good forest management 
and incorporates laws that guarantee sustainable trade and consumption, 
the world's ancient forests and the life they support will disappear 
forever", said Yaroshenko.
