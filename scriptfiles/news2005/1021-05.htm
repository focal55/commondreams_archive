<p>AUSTIN, Texas - October 21- On March 31, 2003, Texans for Public Justice (TPJ) filed a formal complaint with the Travis County District Attorney requesting an investigation into what appeared to be unlawful uses of corporate funds by Congressman Tom DeLay’s Texans for Republican Majority PAC (TRMPAC). Today, Tom DeLay made his first court appearance in Travis County following his indictment on money laundering and other charges related to Texas’ 2002 legislative elections.  
 
<p>“Congressman DeLay has confused his alleged crimes with those meting out the corresponding punishment,” said Texans for Public Justice Director Craig McDonald. “He says his prosecutor and judge are politically motivated. In fact, politics is what motivated DeLay’s TRMPAC to test the limits of Texas elections law.”
 
<p>“It is now clear that Texas’ 2002 elections were marred by criminal acts.  It is up to the criminal justice system to determine whether Congressman DeLay participated in any of these crimes. Anyone guilty of white-collar crimes against Texas’ democracy must be held accountable.”
