<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BURLINGTON, Vermont - July 19  - Be prepared to envy Joshua Glasheen of Lowell, MA because he has scored the coolest summer gig ever. As the winner of the "Take a Stand with Dave Matthews Band" contest - a national search by Ben & Jerry's, Dave Matthews Band and SaveOurEnvironment.org for an "Enviro-Roadie" to go on tour with Dave Matthews Band to mobilize the public to take action to fight global warming - Glasheen has earned the right to say "I'm with the band." <br/><br/><p> As the Enviro-Roadie, Glasheen will be the official ambassador of Ben & Jerry's, Dave Matthews Band and SaveOurEnvironment.org's Lick Global Warming campaign and will join Dave Matthews Band for 23 tour dates from July 16 to September 7. He'll host an interactive exhibit designed to educate people about the issue of global warming and inspire them to take action. He'll also hand out samples of Ben & Jerry's new flavor - Dave Matthews Band Magic Brownies - and maintain a blog on <a href="http://www.LickGlobalWarming.org" target="_blank">www.LickGlobalWarming.org</a> detailing his adventures on the road. </p><p> "Josh was far and away the best candidate we interviewed," said Noelle Pirnie, Integrated Marketing Manager at Ben & Jerry's. "His passion for Dave Matthews Band's music and Ben & Jerry's ice cream combined with his enthusiasm and drive for effecting change and involving people in the fight against global warming impressed all of us." </p><p> Glasheen, a graduate of American University in Washington, DC, was selected out of a field of 1,280 applicants. In addition to having seen more than 100 DMB shows and eaten more pints of Ben & Jerry's than he can count, he has been on the front lines of the fight for the environment. Glasheen served as New Hampshire field director for America Coming Together, a voter mobilization effort with the goal of building a permanent infrastructure for progressives to effect change in federal, state and local governments. He was also Deputy Director for New Hampshire for Governor Howard Dean's Presidential campaign. In these roles, he organized large-scale events featuring Sierra Club's Carl Pope, planned house parties in swing districts to discuss environmental issues with undecided voters, managed a cutting-edge Internet campaign and worked with environmental volunteer activists. </p><p> "Right now, right here is the most fun thing I have ever done!" said Glasheen. "I will work night and day to build a true grassroots, music- and ice cream-inspired base of fans who will become Lick Global Warming volunteer activists. I can't wait to hit the road with Dave Matthews Band to meet people from every corner of this beautiful country, empower them to get involved in the fight to stop global warming, and serve up some tasty Ben & Jerry's ice cream!" </p><p> The competition was open to United States residents ages 18 and over. In 250 words or less, candidates explained what they have done for the environment and why they would be the best person to represent Ben & Jerry's and SaveOurEnvironment.org on tour with Dave Matthews Band. Candidates were judged on their knowledge of the environment, communication skills, dedication, resourcefulness and willingness to learn. </p><p> A Collaboration of Music, Ice Cream and Environmental Activism </p><p> Dave Matthews Band, Ben & Jerry's and SaveOurEnvironment.org - a coalition of the nation's most influential environmental advocacy groups - first joined forces in 2002 to urge people to personally reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2,000 pounds a year and voice their concerns about global warming to Congress. As a result, more than 200 million pounds of CO(2) emissions were pledged to be reduced, and more than 70,000 letters were sent to Congress urging members to support initiatives to fight global warming. </p><p> "Ben and I built Ben & Jerry's on the idea that business has a responsibility to the community and environment," said Jerry Greenfield. "Going on tour with Dave Matthews Band is one way Ben & Jerry's can draw the attention of a broad audience to inspire greater commitment to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We feel that sharing this information will help to ensure future generations are empowered with the skills and knowledge to protect the world we live in." </p><p> "We need to act immediately to reverse global warming," said Dave Matthews. "It's a problem that was created by people and it can be solved by people if we all work together." For its part, Dave Matthews Band is partnering with NativeEnergy to offset the CO(2) pollution impact of every single tour the band has done since their very first in 1992. </p><p> A portion of every sale of Dave Matthews Band's Magic Brownies goes to Dave Matthews Band's Bama Works Foundation and then on to help global warming initiatives. The mouth-watering new flavor features vanilla ice cream with fudge brownies and raspberry swirls. </p><p> About Ben & Jerry's </p><p> Ben & Jerry's produces a wide variety of super-premium ice cream and ice cream novelties, using dairy products from a Vermont dairy cooperative and high-quality ingredients. The company is committed to using milk and cream from cows that have not been treated with the synthetic hormone rBGH, and states its position on rBGH on its labels. Ben and Jerry's products are distributed nationwide and in selected foreign countries in supermarkets, grocery stores, convenience stores, franchise Ben & Jerry's Scoop Shops, restaurants and other venues. </p><p> Ben & Jerry's, a wholly-owned autonomous subsidiary of Unilever, operates its business on a three-part mission statement emphasizing product quality, economic reward and a commitment to the community. Ben & Jerry's contributes a minimum of $1.1 million annually through corporate philanthropy that is primarily employee led. Contributions made via the Ben & Jerry's Foundation in 2001 totaled over $1.4 million. Additionally, the company makes significant product donations to community groups and nonprofits both in Vermont and across the nation. The purpose of Ben & Jerry's philanthropy is to support the founding values of the company: economic and social justice, environmental restoration and peace through understanding, and to support our Vermont communities.
