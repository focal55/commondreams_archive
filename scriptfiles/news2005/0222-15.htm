<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HEIDELBERG,  GERMANY -- February 22 --   February  21,  2005: The U.S. is prolonging its occupation  of  Iraq indefinitely, and thus putting pressure on a U.S. military  short on manpower and falling short of its recruiting goals. This  means  increased  pressure  on currently enlisted soldiers. Most U.S. soldiers have signed eight year contracts, and many in Europe now face  redeployment  to  Iraq  for two and even three stints. While the soldiers  are  in  Iraq,  their  families  live  in the U.S. army base ghettos in Europe, buying their groceries with dollars and waiting for their  loved  ones to come home. Most do come home, but many have been permanently   damaged,   whether  physically  or  psychologically,  by participation  in  a  war involving so many civilian deaths as well as illegal practices such as torture.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because  of these pressures, those soldiers who have heard of Military Counseling  Network (MCN) are now far more likely to pick up the phone and  call  the  MCN  offices  in  downtown  Heidelberg. There two U.S. civilian  volunteers  in  their  twenties,  David Stutzman and Reuben Miller,  stand  ready  to provide U.S. soldiers throughout Germany and also  in Iraq and South Korea with needed counseling services. Founded in  March,  2003,  by the German Mennonite Peace Committee, MCN is the only member of the GI Rights Network outside the United States. MCN is supported  by  CCCO (Central Committee for Conscientious Objection) an organization which has promoted resistance to war since 1948.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to handling cases in the areas of medical care, desertion, homosexuality  and  family hardship, MCN has since early 2003 assisted more  than  20  U.S.  Army  soldiers  in  Germany  and in Iraq to file applications  for conscientious objector status. A small percentage of these  applications have been granted, but most have been denied - and all  have  been  denied  when  the soldier  was  in  Iraq. MCN, which carefully  screens  its  conscientious  objector  cases, believes that these  military  denials have  been  unfair  and  hopes to call these denials  into  question.  Funds are being raised to cover the costs of mounting  a legal  appeal  in U.S. Federal Court by a soldier who was deployed to Iraq and is now stationed in Germany.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCN  has  recently  gathered  new  support from American Voices Abroad (AVA),  a  membership organization of U.S. citizens living and working in many countries in Europe and in the Middle East. AVA members oppose the  doctrine  of  pre-emptive  war  and  the U.S. Patriot Act. At its international  meeting  in  Munich  on Jan. 30 &amp; 31, AVA founded a new Military  Project  to  support  to the  counseling work of MCN and to broaden  efforts  to reach U.S. soldiers and their families throughout Europe with information about GI rights. AVA members in several cities in  Germany,  as  well  as in France, Holland, the Czech Republic, and Lebanon  are participating in the new AVA Military Project. During the demonstrations  on  February  22nd and 23rd protesting Bush`s visit to Europe,  AVA  groups  in  several cities will use the slogan &quot;S.O.S. - Save Our Soldiers - Bring Them Home!&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It  is  important  that  U.S. soldiers learn that they have options,&quot; says  Elsa Rassbach of AVA in Berlin. &quot;We are going to help MCN spread the  message  that  U.S.  soldiers  have  rights  and  can  apply  for conscientious objector status, and we will help raise funds to support legal  costs  of  soldiers.&quot;  There  are  100,000 U.S. service members stationed  in  Europe;  in Germany alone there are 70,000 soldiers and 89,000  dependents.  AVA will work with peace organizations throughout Europe  to  provide information  about GI rights to U.S. soldiers and their families.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every  U.S.  soldier  is  entitled to apply for conscientious objector status,  but  most  such applications are currently being refused. One reason is that the U.S. military has been an all-volunteer force since 1973.  It  is  widely  believed  that  soldiers who  voluntarily sign contracts with the U.S. military have agreed to fight and to kill. Yet the  U.S.  military  has sometimes conceded that a person might change and  develop  conscientious objector views after joining the military. Last  fall,  for example, Sergei Chaparin, a Russian immigrant who had joined  the  U.S.  armed  services,  had  his  claim  of conscientious objection recognized by the highest authority in the Army for COs, the Discharge Review Board.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many  soldiers  signed  up  at a very young age, and few of them could foresee  the  brutality  of a war in which so many civilians have been killed  as  in Iraq. Nor could U.S. soldiers joining the military have known  that  U.S.  commanders  would  be  charged with war crimes; for example,  recently  a  German  attorney  working  with  the Center for Constitutional  Rights, based in New York, filed a law suit in Germany charging  U.S.  Secretary  of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and several U.S. commanders  in  Iraq  with war crimes. U.S. school children learn that German   soldiers  were  wrong  when  they  followed  orders  of  Nazi commanders,  and many U.S. soldiers have developed strong doubts about U.S.  policy  and  military practices in Iraq. At the Walter Reed U.S. hospital for veterans, Specialist Josh Sanders recently told salon.com about  how  he felt during hospital intake: &quot;They asked me if I missed my  wife.  Well,  shit yeah, I missed my wife. That is not the fucking problem  here.  Did  you  ever  put your  foot through a 5-year-old's skull?&quot;<br>  <br>It  usually takes at least nine months for the U.S. military to make a decision  regarding  an application for conscientious objector status, and  an  appeal  can take another nine months. Soldiers who have filed applications  for  conscientious  objector status  often  face severe harassment  in  their  military  units. When deployed to combat areas, some  of  these  conscientious objectors  refuse to carry a weapon or refuse to load their gun.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One  of  the  conscientious objectors counseled by MCN (who prefers to remain  anonymous at this time) is among those who refused to load his gun,  even  though  placed  on dangerous guard duty for many months in Iraq. This soldier recently told U.S. high school students to consider carefully  whether  they  could  in  good  conscience  join a military service  in which they might find themselves causing severe collateral damage:  &quot;Do  you  want  to be responsible for the sorrow of a mother, wife,  and/or  child? How sad do you think your mother would be if you died,  torn  to  pieces  by  gun  fire  or a bomb? Could you live with yourself  knowing  that because of your actions, direct or indirect, a child  will  not  have  a  parent, a wife will not have a husband or a person will not have his limbs.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
