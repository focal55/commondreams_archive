<p>WASHINGTON - November 10 - The Breaking the Chains campaign will be holding protests in cities across the country the week of November 13 through November 19.  From rallies and pickets to film screenings and community education events, people across the country will be participating in events that will increase awareness about the negative business practices of Wal-Mart and other large chains, and encourage consumers to avoid shopping at these stores this holiday season and instead buy local, organic and Fair Trade.

<p>“Our communities are being taken over by these big chains at the expense of local economies. This campaign provides a forum for the many people across the country and world who are concerned about the policies of Wal-Mart and other big chains. Now, during the busiest shopping season of the year consumers will be coming together demanding local, organic, and Fair Trade products and refusing to shop at Wal-Mart,” said Ronnie Cummins, Executive Director of the Organic Consumers Association, which launched the Breaking the Chains campaign.

<p>“People from all walks of life have come together and organized events in over 1000 locations across the country. From pickets and demonstrations to door-to-door leafleting and films screenings, people across the nation will becoming together to break the chains,” says Ryan Zinn of the Organic Consumers Association.

<p>Wal-Mart, which already controls 20% of the grocery store sales in the U.S., has recently announced that they intend to become the dominant retail force in organics. This is troubling to organic consumers and farmers, given the company’s notoriety for driving down prices to producers and selling low-grade products at discount prices. Additionally, Wal-Mart is the nation’s leader of suburban sprawl, poverty wages and gender discrimination. Local, independent businesses are a community’s best bet for long-term prosperity.

<p> The November 13-19 Break the Chains week of protests is being held in conjunction with High Expectations: A National Week of Protest Against Wal-Mart and other anti-corporate, pro local, sustainable, and fair trade events occurring that week. The Breaking the Chains Campaign is focusing consumers' attention on how each purchasing decision can lead to a safer, greener, and more equitable society and leading up Buy Local Month in December. Buy Local Month will encourage consumers to buy local from the day after Thanksgiving through December, typically the busiest month for retail stores.
