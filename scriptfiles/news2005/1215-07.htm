<p>WASHINGTON - December 15 - Today, NARAL Pro-Choice  America issued their report on Judge Alito entitled: &quot;Liberty at  Risk: The Vulnerability of Reproductive Rights Under Alito&quot; in their  first major attack against Alito in advance of his confirmation  hearings which begin on Jan. 9. </p>
<p>   &quot;The report by the National Abortion Rights Action League is  so far outside the mainstream it can hardly be taken seriously.   This is yet another example of how radical pro-abortion liberal  groups want to dictate their agenda of unregulated abortion on  demand with activist judges rather than through the proper course  of legislative debate and law,&quot; Fidelis President Joseph Cella  stated. </p>
<p>   The report suggests that the right to abortion in America is  in imminent danger and states: &quot;Access to abortion is...perilously  close to non-existent in many parts of the country.&quot;  Cella  responded: &quot;The fact of the matter is America has the most  permissive abortion laws in the world.&quot; </p>
<p>   Throughout the report NARAL cites 'rollback' efforts such as  commonsense efforts to inform women of the dangers of abortion,  provide counseling, parental involvement, and restrictions on the  barbarous practice of infanticide called partial birth abortion  as unacceptable. </p>
<p>   Cella said: &quot;The report clearly shows that NARAL views any  regulation on abortion, however beneficial to women, children,  and parents as an assault on their radical agenda.  Their views  are far outside the mainstream of the great majority of  Americans.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;Unfortunately for NARAL, Judge Alito's record is  unambiguously faithful to the law and is clearly not driven by an  agenda,&quot; Cella stated. </p>
<p>   The NARAL report lacks any reference to the opinions of many  pro-abortion legal scholars like Harvard Law Professor Laurence  Tribe who believe Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided.  &quot;Unlike  NARAL, Fidelis is not bringing an extremist agenda into the  debate over Judge Alito's nomination.  We are merely counting on  Judge Alito to re-establish a posture of judicial restraint and  respect for the rule of law,&quot; noted Cella. </p>
