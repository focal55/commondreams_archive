<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 14 --  The Campaign for America&#146;s Future responded in detail today to the RNC&#146;s Friday night attack on the group&#146;s analysis of the impact of President Bush&#146;s campaign to privatize Social Security. The RNC issued a press release and statement late on Friday night that distorts the truth and attacks the Campaign for America&#146;s Future even as the American public and policymakers from both parties express increasing skepticism of the president&#146;s plan to privatize Social Security.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for America&#146;s Future Co-director Roger Hickey said that the RNC campaign of name-calling is a sign of their weakness.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We stand by our analysis of the president&#146;s privatization plan,&#148; said Hickey. &#147;The RNC&#146;s distortions of Campaign for America&#146;s Future and other privatization critics only signals political desperation and an unwillingness to come clean with the facts. Privatization will cut benefits for every working American.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for America&#146;s Future reports attacked by the RNC show that a typical 20-year-old worker would lose $152,000 in guaranteed Social Security benefits if the president&#146;s plan to privatize Social Security is implemented.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The RNC&#146;s attack came as the Campaign for America&#146;s Future promotes the efforts of more than 20 organizations critical of the president&#146;s privatization plan--including the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Alliance for Retired Americans, USAction and others. The groups unleashed a broad assault on the president&#146;s privatization plan, joining with local leaders in every city the president visited following his State of the Union address to launch daily news conferences, rallies and advertisements.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Center for Economic and Policy Research Co-director and Economist Dean Baker, Ph.D., whose data was cited in the Campaign for America&#146;s Future&#146;s reports, immediately responded to the substantive flaws in the RNC&#146;s attack.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baker said that the president has no evidence that privatization would boost guaranteed benefits, citing that the president&#146;s Social Security Commission refuses to provide evidence that a set of dividend and capital gains could add up to the 6.5 percent rate of return they claim is possible with private accounts.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The president, and now the RNC, are playing games with the numbers in describing the impact of their Social Security privatization proposal,&#148; said Baker. &#147;If the president wants an honest debate on the merits of his proposal, he should allow the SSA&#146;s actuaries to rigorously derive a set of projections of stock returns from the profit growth projections used in its analysis of the Social Security programs.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hickey noted that the president has not proposed a real, detailed legislative proposal to improve the long-term solvency of Social Security or explain how he would pay for the massive cost of private accounts.</font></p><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The president&#146;s actual plan is a blank sheet of paper. It&#146;s hard for the RNC to push their distortion campaign when there is nothing behind it,&#148; said Hickey. &#147;If the RNC wants to correct us, they should tell the American people the real details of what the president plans to do to the guaranteed benefits we&#146;ve paid for.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for America&#146;s Future examined Model 2 of the president&#146;s 2001 Social Security Commission to produce the analysis, the only detailed plan released by the Bush administration.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
