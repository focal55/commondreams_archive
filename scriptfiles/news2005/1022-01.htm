<p>SILVER SPRING, Maryland – Peace Action joins with other anti war groups in a nationwide day of action around the 2,000th unnecessary death of an American soldier in Iraq.  Peace Action affiliates, along with allied antiwar groups and coalition partners, plan an array of events around this grim milestone.  Hundreds of vigils, rallies and protests will take place from coast to coast. Participants will call for U.S. troops to be brought home from Iraq and specifically for Congress to provide leadership to bring our troops home.

<p>“The Iraqi killing fields are not going to be quieted by our military force or our posturing, short sighted president and his empty platitudes about staying the course.  Bush failed to have a realistic vision for post-invasion Iraq and his meandering course has led to the grave for over 2,000 American service men and women and estimates upwards of 100,000 Iraqis.  Bush’s insistence on continued military occupation feeds the insurgency. Congress must now take the leadership role in bringing our troops home,” said Kevin M. Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action.

<p>With the 2,000th death expected anytime, and the total wounded now over 15,000, the Iraq quagmire shows no signs of abating.  Peace Action is calling on Congress to take the action that the majority of Americans call for:  bring the troops home.

<p>"Bush and his administration are responsible for each and every death that occurred due to their invasion.  We cannot sit and wait for Bush to change his mind – that will never happen. And, Congress will be culpable for the continuing loss of life to the extent that they allow Bush to sullenly cling to his fantasy of a Hollywood ending to his war.  The 2,000th death marks a terrible milestone, one that should never have occurred.  Now we must come together and show solidarity with those who have been lost, and send a strong message to the White House – no more Americans shall die because of Bush’s lie!”

<p>Nearly 50 years old, Peace Action is the United States' largest peace and disarmament organization with over 100,000 members and nearly 100 chapters in 30 states.  http://www.peace-action.org
