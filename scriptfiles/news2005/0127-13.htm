<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 27 -- Three leading police organizations today urged police nationwide to be on the lookout for a small, easily concealable handgun that fires bullets that penetrate soft body armor, calling the gun an immediate threat to law enforcement officers. They also urged Congress to take appropriate action to help deal with the threat.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers (IBPO), announced their alert at a press conference at a district headquarters of the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Police Department. They were joined by U.S. Senator Charles Schumer and Congressman Elliott Engel of New York.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nobody uses something like this to hunt. Nobody uses something like this for self defense. There's no reason it should be on our streets,&quot; Senator Schumer said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's just plain common sense that this weapon poses a great threat,&quot; said Congressman Engel.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Christopher Shays of Connecticut, who is traveling to Iraq to witness the elections on Sunday, was unable to attend but issued this statement: &quot;I have expressed my deep concern about this cop-killing weapon to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms after one was found on a drunk-driving suspect in Trumbull, Connecticut. It is my hope the ATF will take prompt action to get this weapon off the street and protect the lives of the public and of law enforcement. If the Bureau does not take appropriate action, I will work with my colleagues and take legislative action to do so.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No one is safe from a weapon like this,&quot; said Bernard Thompson, Director of NOBLE. &quot;Police body armor won't offer protection if a criminal has this pistol.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gun, the Five-SeveN handgun manufactured by FN Herstal of Belgium, is lightweight and easily concealable. IBPO Legislative Director Steve Lenkhart referred to the Five-Seven as &quot;an assault rifle that fits in your pocket.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is marketed by the company on its website as intended &quot;to defeat the enemy in all close combat situations in urban areas, jungle conditions, night missions and any self defense action. Enemy personnel, even wearing body armor can be effectively engaged up to 200 meters. Kevlar(r) helmets and vests as well as the CRISAT protection will be penetrated.&quot; (<a href="http://www.fnherstal.com/html/Index.htm" target="_new">http://www.fnherstal.com/html/Index.htm</a>)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Staff of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence recently purchased the weapon at a Virginia gun dealer and test-fired it. The bullets successfully penetrated a police Kevlar vest. A video of the test is available online at <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/" target="_new">http://www.bradycampaign.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michael Barnes, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence united with the Million Mom March, said the group would join with police in working with Congress &quot;to produce a solution to this threat that now faces police officers. We are very interested in working with the House and Senate leadership to eliminate this threat, and there are a number of options available for eliminating the threat.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Police leaders urged every officer in the country to familiarize themselves with the weapon. &quot;I'm concerned about every officer who wears a uniform in this country,&quot; said Gaithersburg, Maryland Police Chief MaryAnn Vivarette. &quot;We are here because we realize these weapons pose a great risk.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We need to realize that the individuals who would be most interested in acquiring this firearm are criminals who want to be able to stop a police officer,&quot; said Deputy Chief Brian Jordan of the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Police Department.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High resolution, publication-ready photographs supporting this story are available at: <a href="http://www.wirepix.com/newsphotos/" target="_new">http://www.wirepix.com/newsphotos/</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
