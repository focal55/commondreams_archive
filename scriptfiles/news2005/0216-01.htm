The Kyoto Protocol is now law and lays the ground for the international community to take the first steps in curbing harmful greenhouse emissions and combating climate change.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace celebrated in the city of Kyoto by flying a hot air balloon over the ancient temples and shrines with the message,<br>&quot;Kyoto: new dawn for the climate&quot;. In Beijing, young activists gave a speech on top of Jingshan Hill, behind the Forbidden City, explaining the need for a global switch to renewable energy and energy efficiency. Among the other cities where Greenpeace held celebrations were Bonn, Moscow, Madrid, Helsinki, Sydney, Bangalore, Hong Kong and Suva.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an historic moment in climate protection&quot;, said Stephanie Tunmore of Greenpeace International. &quot;But it took more than ten years to get here, leaving us with a very short time to make the treaty bite. Every new piece of evidence that emerges on global warming emphasises the urgency of the situation. Now is the time for the world to roll up its sleeves and work on real solutions to climate change.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Past emissions of greenhouse gases mean the world cannot avoid an increase of average global temperature of 1.3&ordm;C higher than pre-industrial levels. If the average temperature rises by 2&ordm;C, the impacts of climate change will be catastrophic. To stay below 2&ordm;C, industrialised countries must go far beyond the Kyoto requirements and reduce emissions by at least 30% from 1990 levels by 2020 and 60-80% by the 2050s, with even further reductions to follow. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The tools for keeping climate change under control, such as renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, are developed and ready to use,&quot; said Tunmore. &quot;Kyoto is the signal that governments and industry have been waiting for. There is now a price on climate pollution and penalties for polluters. The switch to a low carbon economy begins here.&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In stark contrast to the rest of the world, the US and Australia continue to deny the true extent of the climate threat and refuse to act. American and Australian industries are in danger of being left behind as Europe and Japan reap the financial and societal benefits of being first in the race to develop climate friendly technologies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information please contact: <br>Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International climate campaigner + 44 779 69 47 451 Cecilia Goin, Greenpeace International media officer, + 31 6 212 96 908</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Photos and video available upon request: <br>Photo, John Novis, + 31 6 53 819 121 <br>Video, Michael Nagasaka, + 31 6 46 166 309 <br>Web links:<a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/kyotousandbusiness/" target="_new">http://www.greenpeace.org/kyotousandbusiness/</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kyoto Protocol can be found at: <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html" target="_new">http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems and to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This message was brought to you by Greenpeace International.<br></font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
