<p>WASHINGTON - December 29 - Survivors of Hurricane Katrina and their supporters from around the country will converge on the nation’s capitol on February 8th and 9th to demand more help from lawmakers in the recovery and rebuilding of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. 

 

<p>The ACORN Katrina Survivors Association is organizing the caravan and events to demand “the right to return and the funds to rebuild.” Several hundred participants will march, rally, and meet with lawmakers and officials to press for an immediate, comprehensive and inclusive rebuilding plan — and a voice for low and moderate income hurricane survivors in the process.

 

<p>“We are going to Washington to let the world people know how the U.S. government has turned their back on us — the ordinary people of New Orleans who have worked hard all our lives,” said Dorothy Stukes, spokesperson for the ACORN Katrina Survivors Association. “Every Katrina survivor: get on board and let’s fight for the help we need, and deserve, to return and rebuild our homes and communities.”

 

<p>Buses to the rally will depart from Baton Rouge, New Orleans, San Antonio, Little Rock, and other cities housing displaced survivors, arriving in Washington late in the day on February 8th. The rally and other events will take place on February 9th and will be co-sponsored by a variety of labor, faith and community allies.

 

<p>Any Katrina survivor can take part in the trip for $50; other fundraisers are being planned to help cover the remaining costs. Anyone who wishes to participate should call the ACORN Hurricane Hotline at 1-800-790-2290, email <a href="mailto:katrinarelief@acorn.org">katrinarelief@acorn.org</a> or contact their local ACORN office.
