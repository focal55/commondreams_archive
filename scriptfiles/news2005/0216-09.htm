<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 16 -- It's back. Legislation that would shield gun sellers from being held accountable for negligence in court was introduced in the House of Representatives.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year the gun lobby's extremist allies in Congress tried to secure passage of the misleadingly named &quot;Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.&quot; that would have granted broad and unprecedented immunity from civil lawsuits to gun manufacturers and gun dealers. It was defeated in the U.S. Senate after a lengthy battle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation is back, with the introduction of a House bill (H.R. 800). The National Rifle Association is making an all-out effort to push the outrageous legislation through Congress. It's still a horrible public policy idea - editorial writers have written that proponents are &quot;attempting to create a special class of citizens, exempt from the law&quot; (Cleveland Plain Dealer) and that the legislation is &quot;private charity masquerading as public protection&quot; (Indianapolis Star).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This legislation is a shameful giveaway to the worst actors in the gun business,&quot; said Michael Barnes, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence united with the Million Mom March. &quot;It must be defeated, in order to ensure that people who become gun violence victims because of reckless behavior by gun sellers can still seek justice in the courts.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, the proponents of the bill are misleading the nation about the legislation's consequences. &quot;Our legislation is very narrowly tailored to allow suits against any bad actor to proceed,&quot; said Rep. Cliff Stearns of Florida. Rep. Stearns is wrong, and he knows it. It would have let off the hook the gun dealer that &quot;lost&quot; not only the sniper rifle used by the DC area snipers but 238 other guns, along with other dealers that recklessly put guns into the hands of gun traffickers and have since agreed to pay damages. Since the legislation was defeated last year, a gun manufacturer and three gun dealers have settled three high-profile cases for substantial damages:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bushmaster, Bull's Eye Shooter Supply Pay $2.5 Million To D.C. Sniper Victims - In September 2004, the families of victims of the D.C. sniper shootings won a $2.5 million settlement from Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, the dealer who &quot;lost&quot; the snipers' assault rifle, along with at least 238 other guns, and Bushmaster, the assault weapon maker who negligently supplied Bull's Eye despite its disgraceful record of missing guns and regulatory violations. Further, as part of the settlement Bushmaster agreed to inform its dealers of safer sales practices that should prevent other criminals from obtaining guns - something Bushmaster had never done before. Sharing in the settlement were the families of Conrad Johnson, James &quot;Sonny&quot; Buchanan, Hong Im Ballenger, Premkumar Walekar, Sarah Ramos and Linda Franklin, as well as two victims who survived the shootings, Rupinder &quot;Benny&quot; Oberoi and 13-year-old Iran Brown.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Gun Dealer Changes Practices, Compensates Wounded Police Officers - In June 2004, Ken McGuire and Dave Lemongello, former New Jersey police officers shot in the line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a West Virginia dealer, ,won a $1 million settlement. The dealer had sold the gun, along with 11 other handguns, in a cash sale to a straw buyer for a gun trafficker. After the lawsuit, the dealer, as well as two other area pawnshops, agreed to implement safer practices to prevent sales to traffickers, including a new policy of ending large volume sales of handguns. These practices go beyond the law and are not imposed by any manufacturers or distributors.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mother Of Slain Seven Year Old Ends Long Fight to Hold Reckless Dealer Accountable - In August 2004, Tennille Jefferson, whose seven-year-old son, Nafis, was unintentionally killed by another child with a trafficked gun, won a settlement from gun dealer Sauers Trading. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the settlement amounted to $850,000. The handgun was one of many the dealer had sold to the trafficker, despite clear signs that the guns were headed straight to the underground market.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The gun lobby is trying to radically change the rules, to make irresponsible gun dealers and the makers of defective guns the only businesses in America exempt from longstanding principles of negligence, nuisance and product liability,&quot; said Dennis Henigan, Director of the Brady Legal Action Project. &quot;If the extremists had won, none of these cases would have seen the light of day, and justice would have been denied.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The families of the sniper victims would have recovered nothing, while Bull's Eye would have escaped justice and the two injured police officers would not have received justice. It would have been business as usual in those West Virginia shops where guns were sold without limit to gun trafficking teams, Tennille Jefferson would have been tossed out of court and Sauers Trading would have escaped accountability for supplying a gun trafficker.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress must reject this special interest scheme again. The gun industry should be subject to the same legal rules as all other American businesses. And the courthouse doors must remain open to legitimate victims harmed by the dangerous and irresponsible actions of firearm manufacturers and sellers.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
