<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 11 -- As the Senate begins hearings on asbestos today, USAction President William McNary urged Senators to remember the innocent workers and their families who are the real victims, rather than the corporate wrong-doers. McNary released the following statement:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;President Bush missed an opportunity last week to demonstrate his concern for innocent workers and their families who were knowingly exposed to asbestos. He never once talked about the real tragedy: the healthcare crisis facing the tens of thousands of American workers who, without being told, were exposed to this deadly substance. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The President didn&#146;t talk about the horrible diseases that come from exposure, or the fact that asbestos manufacturers, and their insurers, have known for over half a century that the substance was deadly, and knowingly exposed workers anyway.  He also neglected to mention that the victims&#151;honest workers coming home from work&#151;unwittingly took the poison home with them on their work clothes, and tragically exposed their spouses and children. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Instead, the President used his bully pulpit last week to repeatedly make clear that his number one priority is to protect asbestos manufacturers, the insurance industry, HMOs, the pharmaceutical companies and the nursing home industry from being held accountable for poisoning their workers; for injuries from medical errors, harmful drugs and other products.</font></p><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;USAction believes that the first step Congress should take is to ban asbestos. The starting point for a federal trust fund must be the needs of current and future workers, their families and others exposed to this deadly product, not the needs of the very industries that knowingly poisoned them.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We urge the Senate to support Senator Murray&#146;s proposed ban on asbestos and to develop a trust fund that truly is fair to innocent workers and their families.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>USAction is dedicated to winning social, racial, and economic justice for all.
