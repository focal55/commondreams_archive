<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 15 -- An action alert that Common Cause sent to members on Monday evening has resulted so far in nearly 50,000 e-mails and faxes sent to Congress, urging Members to support a proposal by Rep. Alan Mollohan (D-WV) to jump start the now-defunct ethics process in the House.  That is by far the most responses we've ever generated in less than 24 hours, and we know that they are hearing you on Capitol Hill.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, Common Cause on Tuesday joined with its partners in the Congressional Ethics Coalition at a press conference urging the House to bring the ethics process back to life by supporting Mollohan's efforts to rescind the partisan rules changes that GOP leaders forced on the House in January. Mollohan has introduced a resolution to roll back the partisan changes aimed at protecting House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) So far, 192 Members have signed on as co-sponsors to the resolution, all but one, Rep. Chris Shays (R-CT), are Democrats.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mollohan and Democrats on the Ethics Committee have refused to formally allow the Ethics Committee to organize and begin work in this Congress, making the panel essentially non-existent and putting the House in an unprecedented situation of having no ethics process whatsoever.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause supports Mollohan's position because the rules forced on the House would ensure the ethics-free zone continues. One of the new rules would dismiss a complaint in the event of a deadlock within the ethics committee, which is equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. If reforms are to be made to the House ethics process, they must be considered individually, in a bipartisan manner, not pushed through by leadership as part of a larger package.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Passing this resolution and reversing the rules changes is critical to the integrity and credibility of the House,&quot; Common Cause President Chellie Pingree said at the press conference.</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the action comes as DeLay returned to Capitol Hill after he was reportedly hospitalized for fatigue and was greeted warily by GOP colleagues who are reportedly growing tired of his negative publicity.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
