<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 16 -- Following is a statement of Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer on Ethics Committee staff firings and continuing wholesale purge of Ethics Committee by House Republican Leaders:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision of House Ethics Committee Chairman Doc Hastings to fire professional staff members of the Ethics Committee is just the latest step in the wholesale purging of the Ethics Committee by House Republican leaders.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have now seen Republican members of the Ethics Committee and professional staff members of the Committee thrown out of their positions apparently because they had the temerity to do their jobs and hold House Majority Leader Tom DeLay accountable last year for his multiple cases of ethical misconduct.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I assume the next move to be made by Speaker Dennis Hastert, Majority Leader DeLay and Ethics Committee Chairman Hastings will be to clear out the furniture from the Ethics Committee office and turn it into a storeroom.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concerted effort of House Republican leaders to shut down ethics enforcement in the House is an act of hubris, and an enormous disservice to the country and to the institution they are responsible for leading. House Members in both parties have a public responsibility to stand up and challenge the Republican leadership campaign to kill ethics rules and ethics enforcement in the House.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
