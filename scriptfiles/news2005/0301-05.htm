<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 1 -- The Ms. Foundation for Women joins women's coalitions and organizations across the globe to celebrate Beijing &amp; Beyond: Global Week of Action for Women's Rights. Over the next eight days, thousands of women's rights activists will gather at teach-ins, marches, workshops, cultural events, in-person and online all over the world to reaffirm the Beijing Platform for Action, which encourages political participation, education and the protection of human rights for women.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the Ms Foundation for Women's delegation to the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Sara Gould joined 33,000 women to strategize for the improvement of women's lives on a global level. She conducted workshops on economic development and girls' issues along with the Ms. Foundation's Beijing Network that was comprised of 120 women, including 35 grantees.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUOTE: &quot;At a time when women's rights are under attack here in the US and abroad, we must continue to both hold governments accountable for protecting and advancing the rights of ALL people,&quot; said Sara K. Gould, Ms. Foundation for Women. &quot;As a leading funder of women's rights in the United States we understand and know that to build permanent change for women we must connect our issues and our movements within and across borders. This week provides women from around the world the opportunity to join together locally and across nations to hold our governments accountable to the promise and commitments of the Beijing Platform for Action&quot;, she emphasized.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
