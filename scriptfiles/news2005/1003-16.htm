<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - President Bush’s nomination of his personal lawyer and friend, Harriet Miers, demands rigorous scrutiny—particularly in light of her complete lack of judicial experience.  The burden is on Harriet Miers to demonstrate her commitment to upholding the rights and legal protections Americans depend on, and the Senate must insist she meet this burden.  No less than the future of our health and environment is at stake.


<p>Protecting the environment has been challenging during the past four years, as an increasingly partisan Congress and White House attempt to reverse three decades of environmental progress.  The courts have provided a breath of fresh air during this time, serving as an independent voice for enforcing the laws that protect the water we drink, air we breathe and lands we cherish.  Justice Sandra Day O’Connor—whose vacancy Harriet Miers has been nominated to fill—often played a pivotal role in upholding environmental protections.  The Senate must demand answers about whether Miers will uphold the right of all Americans to a clean and healthy environment.
