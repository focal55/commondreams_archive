<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 15 - Members of Congress  received tens of thousands of letters from constituents this week  demanding that the federal government adopt a bold, progressive  plan to rebuild the Gulf Coast and rebuild America. The letters  are based on a 6-point plan published online by the Campaign for  America's Future, a progressive group fighting for an economy  that works for working people.</p>
<p>   With nearly half of New Orleans still underwater and more than  a million people left homeless, a movement is forming to focus  national attention and action on overlooked investment priorities  like the need for energy conservation and solutions to rising  levels of poverty. Recent polls shows Americans are willing to  pay to rebuild New Orleans and help with Hurricane Katrina  recovery, job training and housing for survivors.</p>
<p>   Campaign for America's Future co-director Roger Hickey said  that the Bush administration's failure to plan for the  unprecedented destruction of a major U.S. city and communities  across the Gulf Coast demonstrates the failure of the radical,  conservative attack on government.</p>
<p>   "The president is claiming responsibility for the failure, but  this wasn't just a failure to handle one natural disaster," said  Hickey. "This debacle shows the failure of three decades of  conservative, anti-government philosophy."</p>
<p>   President Bush plans to address the nation Thursday night from  Louisiana, delivering his first formal speech weeks after the  hurricane destroyed the Gulf Coast. The speech is aimed at  mending his image.</p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future's "Rebuild the Gulf Coast,  Rebuild America" agenda is getting support from labor, civil  rights, women's groups and community organizing networks and  demands decisive action to address the immediate problems of  rebuilding the devastated region. Republicans are using Hurricane  Katrina to back more conservative, anti-government ideas,  including the suspension of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage laws,  waiver of Affirmative Action rules for employers with federal  contracts in the Gulf Region and exemptions from the Estate Tax.</p>

<p>   CAMPAIGN FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE AGENDA TO REBUILD THE GULF  COAST, REBUILD AMERICA</p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future Rebuild the Gulf Coast,  Rebuild America agenda is being embraced by labor, civil rights,  women's groups and community organizing networks. It demands  decisive action to address the immediate problems of rebuilding  the devastated region and the need to do more.</p>
<p>   We pledge ourselves to work together to advance a larger  progressive agenda to address our country's real problems. We  pledge to work together to build support for an ambitious plan we  call Rebuild the Gulf Coast and Rebuild America.</p>
<p>   1. We want Congress and the Bush administration to take  immediate steps, as proposed by Senate Minority Leader Reid, to  meet the urgent health care, housing, education and economic  needs of the millions of Americans affected by Katrina.</p>
<p>   2. We call for a long-term effort to rebuild the Gulf Coast  region -- to reestablish commerce, construct energy-efficient  housing, and reduce the impact of future natural disasters by  rebuilding in a way that works with, not against, natural  wetlands and river systems. </p>
<p>   -- This reconstruction effort should include jobs and training  for unemployed residents of the Gulf -- similar to the Civilian  Conservation Corps -- as proposed by NAACP Chair Julian Bond.  This would put money in the pockets of the 400,000 newly  unemployed people -- in places where few jobs are available,  especially for the unskilled. </p>
<p>   Note: CAF is joining with other groups to protest President  Bush's over-riding of federal rules mandating "prevailing wages"  -- and now his actions to over-ride affirmative action and  environmental rules -- on federal reconstruction projects in the  Gulf states. "We should be creating good construction and service  jobs for displaced residents of the Gulf -- and those jobs should  pay wages that support a family," said Hickey. "And we should be  rebuilding with a representative workforce and in a way that  improves the environment, not ignoring environmental rules, he  declared."</p>
<p>   3. We call for strengthening, not weakening, the social safety  net -- for those affected by the hurricane and for all Americans.  We call on Congress not to proceed with the Bush Administration's  planned budget cuts in Medicaid, housing, food stamps and  education. </p>
<p>   -- Congress should repeal the recently-passed Bankruptcy Bill  to help families struggling with disasters and soaring gas prices </p>
<p>   -- Congress should stop Bush's Social Security Privatization  because we need guaranteed family security. </p>
<p>   -- We pledge to work for economic change to build an America  where no one is stuck in poverty, and where all our people have  jobs, health care, education, and healthy communities. </p>
<p>   4. We call on President Bush and Republicans in Congress to  renounce all efforts to repeal the Estate Tax -- not just  postpone a vote as Senator Frist has now done. And they should  also give up their continuing campaign to make the Bush tax cuts  permanent. Instead of rewarding the rich with favors, we need to  restore tax fairness while raising the revenues for the  investment we need to rebuild America. </p>
<p>   5. We demand a plan to start bringing our troops home from  Iraq and rebuild the stretched National Guard to deal with future  emergencies. </p>
<p>   6. We pledge to work to pass the Apollo Alliance plan for  energy independence - starting with immediate efforts to reduce  US demand for foreign oil. America should declare a goal of  reducing our dependence on foreign energy and of dramatically  cutting pollution that alters the earth's climate. This will  require retooling our homes, communities and transportation  systems and challenging vested energy interests to change. And we  urge Congress to move quickly on Sen. Byron Dorgan's plan for an  excess profits tax on energy companies, with revenue devoted to  reconstruction and investment in energy independence. </p>
<p>   CAF and allies pledge to work toward this Rebuild the Gulf  Coast and Rebuild America agenda by sending this message to your  elected officials -- and to let them know that supporters won't  stop until they have transformed our government from one that  tells us: "You are on your own," to a democratic instrument that  helps us declare, "We can solve any problem together."</p>
