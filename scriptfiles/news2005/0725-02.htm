<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HALIFAX, Canada - July 25 - The Greenpeace ship Esperanza arrived in  the Northwest Atlantic today to document the indiscriminate devastation  of deep-sea marine ecosystems caused by the most destructive of all  industrial fishing methods - high seas bottom trawling. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">60% of all high seas bottom trawling occurs in the Northwest Atlantic by  only a few countries (1). The vessels drag weighted nets along the sea  floor. Huge chains or rollers attached to the front of the nets destroy  everything in their path, including highly sensitive cold-water coral  and sponge forests. They also catch numerous other marine species, which  are thrown overboard, dead or dying, as 'trash'.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even the fishing industry itself concedes that this is the most  damaging of all fishing methods. These fleets bulldoze the ocean floor  with their nets, killing everything in their path. Unless the UN adopts  a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling now, much of our rich ocean  life will be wiped out and more fisheries will reach the brink of  collapse,&quot; said Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace International Oceans Campaigner.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The destruction of deep-sea life in international waters off the east  coast of Canada is especially troubling because, unlike most other  international waters, there is a regulatory body in place to regulate  high seas bottom trawling in that area. A Greenpeace report released  today: The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization: A Case Study In  How Regional Fisheries Management Organisations Regularly Fail To Manage  Our Oceans shows, however, that the NAFO has failed to consider the  impacts of industrial fishing on the marine ecosystem as a whole (2). In  2005, moratoria continue to be in place on four out of the six  groundfish stocks that they manage, because they have been so  overfished. (3)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For 25 years, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Management Organisation  (NAFO) has failed to protect the marine environment in this area,  leading to the destruction of some of the world's most productive  fisheries - the most infamous example being the collapse of the northern  cod fishery,&quot; said Bruce Cox, Executive Director of Greenpeace Canada. (4)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Without radical changes, Regional Fisheries Management Organisations  such as NAFO will be unable to protect deep sea biodiversity and will  continue to struggle to sustainably manage their fisheries,&quot; said Martin  Willison of Dalhousie University.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Notes to Editors: <br>(1) The ships are from, among others, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Canada,  and Russia. <br>(2) For a copy of the report visit:  http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/NAFO-Case-Study <br>(3) &quot;The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation: a case study on how  RFMOs regularly fail to manage our Oceans, &quot;Greenpeace International,  June 2005 at  http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/NAFO-Case-Study, p 4.<br>(4) Abundant cod resources first attracted European fishers to the waters of the Northwest Atlantic hundreds of years ago.  In the 1950s, this fishery became industrialised.  By the late 1980s it had collapsed as a result of overfishing.  A moratorium on cod fishing was established in 1992 and has yet to be lifted.</font></p><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>The MV Esperanza documentation follows a similar tour by the Rainbow Warrior in June in the international waters between Australia and New Zealand. Greenpeace exposed a New Zealand bottom trawler throwing a 500 year-old piece of coral overboard that it had ripped from the seabed while fishing, and hauled up in its nets.See: <a href="http://www.greenpeace.gen.nz/gallery/" target="_new">http://www.greenpeace.gen.nz/gallery/</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more details of the tour, and to follow the ship's diary, visit: <br><a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/deepsea" target="_new">http://weblog.greenpeace.org/deepsea</a>.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
