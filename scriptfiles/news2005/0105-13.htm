<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 6 -- &#147;Peace Action unequivocally calls for the rejection of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General&#151;a man who came to great success from humble beginnings only to rationalize the foreclosure of the most basic rights of others. Much is made of President Bush&#146;s Attorney General nominee&#146;s humble beginnings by his supporters. As supporters of peace, our over 100,000 members believe in a world where all people, including the humble and meek, are allowed succeed&#151;to live free of fear and oppression,&#148; said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to concerns about Mr. Gonzales&#146; role as architect of the Bush administration&#146;s policies that led to torture in Abu Ghraib, Guatanamo Bay and Afghanistan, Peace Action is currently in the midst of a citizen&#146;s campaign to urge all U.S. Senators to do their Constitutional duty by denying consent to Mr. Gonzales&#146; nomination. This campaign involves both direct and indirect constituent pressure on Senators to vote against Gonzales. Peace Action is also acting in concert with the myriad of other groups working on the Gonzales nomination including Win Without War and Church Folks for a Better America. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;A man who would rationalize torture, even during war, is a man who would rationalize anything. Such a man is not fit to be the Attorney General&#151;the American people&#146;s lawyer&#151;in our nation of laws,&#148; concluded Mr. Martin.   <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
