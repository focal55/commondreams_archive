<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 7 - House Democratic Leader  Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Senator Kent  Conrad, Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee, and  Congressman John Spratt, Ranking Member of the House Budget  Committee sent a letter to the Republican Leadership and Chairmen  of the House and Senate Budget Committee, urging them to suspend  budget reconciliation, which would have required $35 billion in  spending cuts by the end of next week .  Helping the needs of the  victims of Hurricane Katrina must be the top priority of  Congress, not cutting services for the most vulnerable while  providing tax cuts for the wealthiest, the letter said.
<p>   Below is the text of the letter:</p>
<p>   September 7, 2005</p>
<p>   Dear Majority Leader Frist, Speaker Hastert, Chairman Gregg,  and Chairman Nussle:</p>
<p>   As we assess the nation's needs in the aftermath of Hurricane  Katrina, we urge you to suspend indefinitely consideration of the  spending and revenue bills required by the reconciliation  instructions in this year's budget resolution.  Instead, we call  for swift Congressional consideration of legislation that  reflects the nation's needs after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>   Now is not the time to cut services for our most vulnerable,  cut taxes for our most fortunate, and add $35 billion to the  deficit.  When the Congress narrowly approved this year's budget  resolution in April, we argued that the budget and its  reconciliation instructions reflected the wrong priorities for  our country.  The new circumstances created by Hurricane Katrina  magnify these concerns, and suggest that an adjustment to the  previous plan is needed.</p>
<p>   The budget resolution's spending reconciliation instructions  require authorizing committees to recommend $35 billion in  spending cuts by September 16.  If allowed to go forward, this  bill would likely cut programs that many victims of Hurricane  Katrina will be relying on, including Medicaid, food stamps, and  student loans.  Clearly, it makes no sense to consider such a  bill at a time when the massive needs of those affected by  Hurricane Katrina are still being assessed.</p>
<p>   The budget resolution's revenue reconciliation instructions  require the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to report a  bill cutting taxes by up to $70 billion by September 23.  The  anticipated consideration of this legislation comes at a time of  near-record annual deficits and ongoing expenditures in Iraq and  Afghanistan totaling at least $6 billion per month.  In light of  these circumstances and, moreover, given that the cost to the  federal budget of the response to Hurricane Katrina has yet to be  determined, we should not rush through a further reduction in the  resources the federal government has available to respond to our  nation's challenges.</p>
<p>   The budget resolution -- including its reconciliation  instructions -- is a fundamental statement of our policy  priorities.  Hurricane Katrina will require a rethinking of these  priorities. Under the present circumstances we believe it would  be misguided to proceed with fast-track consideration of  legislation that would place at risk services to those in need  and divert resources that are necessary to fund the federal  response to this tragedy.</p>
<p>   Sincerely,</p>
<p>   Harry Reid,    Senate Democratic Leader</p>
<p>   Kent Conrad,    Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member</p>
<p>   Nancy Pelosi,    House Democratic Leader</p>
<p>   John M. Spratt, Jr.,    House Budget Committee Ranking Member</p>
