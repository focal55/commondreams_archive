In coalition with civil rights, labor, religious, business and other community organizations, Equality California is organizing the most comprehensive grassroots effort to date alongside local communities and its chapters across the state.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EQCA is asking individuals and organizations to come together in a statewide campaign of public education and increased visibility for LGBT families and friends regarding this vital legislation.  This campaign will include meetings with legislators in Sacramento and their districts, grassroots advocacy of phone calls, emails, and letters, plus a mid-May state-wide summit and lobby day in Sacramento.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;2005 will be another landmark year for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights in California,&quot; said Geoffrey Kors, Executive Director of Equality California.  &quot;Momentum, strength, and visibility continues to build on the side of equality and justice, and the majority of fair-minded Californians believe the LGBT community deserves the same equal treatment as any other resident of this great state.  Working closely with California's LGBT Legislative Caucus and developing a wide array of organizations and coalitions will make us stronger and more successful in achieving full equality for all.  This is an opportunity for local communities to become active and get involved.  EQCA chapters are being called to action to make history.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, five of the six Equality California-sponsored pieces of legislation were passed and made law resulting in California extending equal insurance coverage to registered domestic partners, improved and strengthened hate crime protections, and uniform employment and housing non-discrimination law.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EQCA is sponsoring the following legislation:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AB 19: Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act (Assemblymember Mark Leno) - This bill will guarantee the California Constitution's protection of religious freedom and ensure equal treatment under the law by allowing same-sex couples to marry in California.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AB 1400: Civil Rights Act of 2005 (Assemblymember John Laird) - This bill amends California's Unruh Civil Rights Act (Unruh Act) to clarify that people are protected from discrimination by business establishments regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or familial status.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AB 1160: &quot;Panic&quot; Excuse Prevention (Assemblymember Sally Lieber) - This bill would redefine &quot;heat of passion&quot; to prevent use of a &quot;panic&quot; strategy which relies on blaming the victim for a lighter sentence in murder trials for protected groups.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AB 866: Code of Fair Campaign Practices Bill (Assemblymember Leland Yee) - This bill adds sexual orientation and gender identity to the voluntary pledge provided for in the Code of Fair Campaign Practices that the  candidate or campaign committee will not use or permit any appeal to negative prejudice based on the listed categories.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SB 973:  Domestic Partner In-Fact Legislation for Public Employees (Senator Sheila  Kuehl) - This legislation would create a process by which domestic partners that retired prior to the effective date of AB 205 (1-1-2005) to prove their relationship for death benefits.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AB 1586:  Insurance Gender Non-Discrimination Bill (Assemblymember Paul Koretz) - The bill will add additional language to clarify existing  anti-discrimination provisions under the California Health and Safety Code and the California Insurance Code to make explicit that state law prohibits  insurance companies and health care service plans from discriminating on the  basis of gender in the creation or maintenance of service contracts or the  provision of benefits or coverage.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1998, Equality California is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, grassroots-based, statewide advocacy organization whose mission is to ensure the dignity, safety, equality and civil rights of all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Californians.
