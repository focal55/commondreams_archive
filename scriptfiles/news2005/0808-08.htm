<td colspan="2"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PITTSBURGH - August 8 - As amphibians continue to mysteriously disappear worldwide, a University of
Pittsburgh researcher may have found more pieces of the puzzle. Elaborating
on his previous research, Pitt assistant professor of biological sciences
Rick Relyea has discovered that Roundup(r), the most commonly used herbicide
in the world, is deadly to tadpoles at lower concentrations than previously
tested; that the presence of soil does not mitigate the chemical's effects;
and that the product kills frogs in addition to tadpoles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In two articles published in the August 1 issue of the journal Ecological
Applications, Relyea and his doctoral students Nancy Schoeppner and Jason
Hoverman found that even when applied at concentrations that are one-third
of the maximum concentrations expected in nature, Roundup(r) still killed up
to 71 percent of tadpoles raised in outdoor tanks.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relyea also examined whether adding soil to the tanks would absorb the
Roundup(r) and make it less deadly to tadpoles. The soil made no difference:
After exposure to the maximum concentration expected in nature, nearly all
of the tadpoles from three species died.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Roundup(r) is not approved for use in water, scientists have found
that the herbicide can wind up in small wetlands where tadpoles live due to
inadvertent spraying during the application of Roundup(r).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Studying how Roundup(r) affected frogs after metamorphosis, Relyea found
that the recommended application of Roundup(r) Weed and Grass Killer, a
formulation marketed to homeowners and gardeners, killed up to 86 percent of
terrestrial frogs after only one day.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The most striking result from the experiments was that a chemical designed
to kill plants killed 98 percent of all tadpoles within three weeks and 79
percent of all frogs within one day,&quot; Relyea wrote.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Previous studies have determined that it is Roundup(r)'s surfactant
(polyethoxylated tallowamine, or POEA, an &quot;inert&quot; ingredient added to make
the herbicide penetrate plant leaves) and not the active herbicide
(glyphosate) that is lethal to amphibians.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This research was funded by the National Science Foundation, Pitt&sup1;s McKinley
Fund, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Science.</font></p>
