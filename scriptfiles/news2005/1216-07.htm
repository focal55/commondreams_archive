<p>WASHINGTON  - December 16 - As the Senate prepares  for hearings on Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, NARAL  Pro-Choice America has issued a new report that documents Alito's  record on women's reproductive freedom and what threats he could  pose to the principles of Roe vs. Wade if he is confirmed. </p>
<p>   Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said the  organization's analysis of the nominee's record demonstrates  that, if Alito is confirmed to a lifetime position on the Supreme  Court, he will have ample opportunity to dismantle or even  overturn Roe vs. Wade.</p>
<p>   "This report outlines why our cherished rights depend on  judges who share our values: freedom and personal responsibility,  and a legal philosophy that government and politicians shouldn't  insert themselves into our most personal, private decisions,"  Keenan said.  "Samuel Alito has tried to ensure that without  explicitly overturning Roe, Roe is no longer understood to be a  guarantee of reproductive freedom and justice.  The nomination of  Alito tests whether Roe will be a mantelpiece memory, or a  meaningful part of our Constitution. Americans know that Alito's  legal philosophy would result in an America in which 'the  constitution does not protect a right to an abortion.'"</p>
<p>   Keenan said the initial report on Alito reflected the  organization's role as the nation's leading advocate for personal  privacy and a woman's right to choose, including the commitment  to providing insightful analysis of the status of women's  reproductive rights.</p>
<p>   "For 15 years, NARAL Pro-Choice America has chronicled the  erosion of reproductive rights in our annual publication, Who  Decides?  The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United  States," Keenan said. "Liberty at Risk builds on this record and  chronicles the status of and threats to reproductive freedom now.   The report goes beyond the question of whether Roe stands or Roe  falls, and asks whether the country can accept a justice who  endorses more and more incursions on Roe's central principles."</p>
