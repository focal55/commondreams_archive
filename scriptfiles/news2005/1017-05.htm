<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>RALEIGH, North Carolina - The Brady Center to  Prevent Gun Violence today filed a lawsuit on behalf of the widow  of a Wake County, North Carolina Sheriff's Investigator, charging  that a gun shop's negligence helped arm his killer.</p>
<p>   Investigator Mark Tucker was shot in the face with a shotgun  and killed on February 12, 2004, by Matthew Grant, a convicted  felon.  The suit seeks to recover damages from Cary Jewelry &amp;  Pawn, who supplied Grant's friend, Van McQueen, with the 12-gauge  Mossberg shotgun that was used to kill Investigator Tucker.   Grant is also a named defendant.</p>
<p>   The suit was filed in Wake County court and claims that Cary  Jewelry &amp; Pawn, of Cary, North Carolina, negligently and  illegally sold the murder weapon to an obviously dangerous  person.</p>
<p>   In November 2003, Van McQueen and Matthew Grant went to Cary  Jewelry &amp; Pawn to buy a firearm.  McQueen planned to purchase a  firearm as a straw buyer for Grant, because Grant was a felon  prohibited from buying guns, and in return Grant promised to buy  McQueen a beer.  McQueen was mentally deficient and was obviously  intoxicated, and the shop's clerk refused to sell him a gun.   Three days later, McQueen returned to the pawn shop with Grant,  again wanting to buy a firearm.  Although his home address was a  local mission, McQueen had $120 in cash to buy the weapon.  This  time, even though the same clerk who had seen McQueen intoxicated  three days earlier was on duty, the shop completed the all-cash  sale.  McQueen then transferred the shotgun to Grant, who used it  to shoot Investigator Tucker in the face, killing him.  Grant was  arrested, convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life  in prison for the murder of Investigator Tucker.</p>
<p>   &quot;The evidence in this case clearly shows that the gun dealer  irresponsibly and illegally sold a shotgun to a man it knew to be  dangerous,&quot; said Daniel R. Vice, Staff Attorney with the Brady  Center.  &quot;The gun dealer chose to make a quick buck rather than  protect public safety -- greed and recklessness caused the death  of a brave law enforcement officer.&quot;</p>
<p>   Investigator Tucker's widow is represented by attorneys with  the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and by E. Spencer Parris  of the Jones Martin Parris &amp; Tessener Law Offices.  The Brady  Center represents victims of gun violence in lawsuits against  irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers who supply guns to  criminals.  Last year, the Center obtained settlements in three  high-profile cases on behalf on gun violence victims last year,  including victims of the Washington, D.C.-area snipers, totaling  $4.4 million.</p>
