<p>WASHINGTON - December 14 - Secretary of 
            State James Baker warned in 1991 that Japan's &quot;bitter history&quot; 
            with the Koreas would &quot;inhibit policy coordination,&quot; even 
            though &quot;Japan has important economic leverage on the North which

              Washington's most important Asian ally more closely on central issues

            <p>The National Security Archive is pleased to announce the addition 
              of <em><a href="http://nsarchive.chadwyck.com/jap2_intr.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Japan 
              and the United States: Diplomatic, Security, and Economic Relations, 
              Part II: 1977-1992</strong></a></em>, collected and edited by Dr. 
              Robert A. Wampler, to the collection of major document collections 
              available on the <a href="http://nsarchive.chadwyck.com/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Digital 
              National Security Archive</em></strong></a>. This is the most important 
              compilation of formerly classified documents publicly available 
              on relations between the United States and Japan during the Carter, 
              Reagan and Bush I presidencies. This was the period when the Cold 
              War drew to a close and U.S. policy-makers strove to develop a new 
              global strategy. Incorporating the latest U.S. government releases, 
              obtained largely through the Freedom of Information Act, this collection 
              significantly enriches the historical record. White House, State 
              Department, Pentagon, Commerce Department, CIA and other documents, 
              virtually all of them previously classified, cover all the major 
              issues from this critical period, including high-level diplomatic, 
              military and economic relations. Topics covered in detail include 
              summit meetings during all three presidential administrations, U.S. 
              objectives in major trade negotiations on such items as automobiles 
              and semiconductors, the Structural Dialogue talks on trade, U.S. 
              efforts to guide Japanese defense policy, and the impact of the 
              first Persian Gulf conflict on U.S.-Japan relations. The collection 
              also incorporates new material from 1960-1976 released since the 
              publication of <em><strong><a href="http://nsarchive.chadwyck.com/jap_intr.htm" target="_blank">Japan

            Published here for the first time are previously classified documents 
            dealing with the full range of major policy issues in U.S.-Japan relations,

              <p>This document recounts the first official meeting between the 
                newly-inaugurated Carter administration and the Japanese government 
                of Prime Minister Fukuda, as Vice President Mondale visited several 
                key U.S. allies in East Asia soon after the inauguration. Wide 
                ranging in scope, the conversation highlighted a number of issues 
                that would put stress on U.S.-Japan relations in the coming years, 
                in particular Carter's desire to scale down the U.S. troop presence 
                in South Korea and Japan's fear this was the precursor to a major 
                American withdrawal from Asia, relations with China and Taiwan, 
                and U.S.-Japan trade issues.</p>

              <p>Here again Korea and China are at the forefront of the issues

                January 22, 1981</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>This meeting, one of the first between the newly-elected Reagan 
                administration and the Japanese government, reveals two issues 
                that the U.S. would be pressing Japan to address: increased Japanese 
                defense expenditures, and action to tackle the growing influx 
                of Japanese automobiles in the U.S.</p>

                Defense, North South, March 23, 1981</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>Another early encounter between the Reagan administration and 
                the Japanese government, this time a meeting between Secretary 
                of State Haig and two key Japanese officials, Foreign Minister 
                Ito and Ambassador Okawara. Here again, a major topic of concern 
                was the growing American domestic political pressures on the government 
                to do something about the increasing number of Japanese automobile 
                imports; much of the talk centered on how the two governments 
                could best address this issue. Interestingly, both Haig and Ito 
                agreed that Japanese imports were not the cause of the U.S. car 
                industry's problems, but steps still needed to be taken that could 
                be seen as actively attacking the problem.</p>

              <p>In this document, Defense Secretary Weinberger lays out for President 
                Reagan the administration's line of argument for pressing on visiting 
                Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki the U.S. goals for increased Japanese 
                defense spending. Weinberger argues that the U.S. has failed in 
                past efforts because, according to the Japanese, it never spelled 
                out what specifically the U.S. wanted Japan to do. To begin this 
                process of educating the Japanese, Weinberger provided Reagan 
                with talking points for his upcoming meeting with Suzuki.</p>

              <p>Here, U.S. Trade Representative William Brock provides the president 
                with his office's analysis of Japanese trade barriers, their impact 
                upon U.S. trade and the economy, and how the U.S. should begin 
                to address this problem. Brock concluded there were two basic 
                problems that needed to be solved: how to change fundamental Japanese 
                structural and attitudinal approaches to trade, and overcoming 
                Japanese resistance to any move toward increased imports that 
                they see as endangering full employment and the development of 
                knowledge-intensive industries.</p>

              <p>This memorandum underscores the way in which persistent U.S.-Japan 
                trade conflicts were threatening to undermine continued cooperation 
                on defense issues, in particular the U.S. push for increased Japanese 
                defense spending. A common problem for both governments was growing 
                problems with legislators, in Congress and the Diet, who were 
                creating domestic political obstacles for Reagan and Prime Minister 
                Nakasone over trade issues. For Nakasone, this was a particular 
                problem, given his efforts to overturn the existing limits on 
                Japanese defense spending.</p>

              <p>This memorandum surveys the key issues surrounding the upcoming 
                summit meeting between Reagan and Nakasone in April 1987. Among 
                the key issues surveyed are the persistent trade friction and 
                resulting protectionist mood in Congress, the slow pace of structural 
                economic reform in Japan, and the potential risk that the planned 
                Japanese fighter plane, the FSX, and agreements between the two 
                nations on its development might link defense and trade in a damaging 
                way (a prescient observation).</p>

                9. Memorandum (S), from Secretary of State Shultz to the President, 
                Subject: Visit of Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone, April 29-May 
                2, April 21, 1987</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>Here, Shultz provides Reagan with his bullet points on the key 
                issues and objectives sought by each side during Reagan's meetings 
                with Prime Minister Nakasone. Trade tensions continue to bedevil 
                the relationship, as seen in U.S. disappointment over slow moves 
                to open Japan to imports, Congress' frustrations and concerns 
                over Japan's high-tech competitive challenge, and trade sanctions 
                over alleged dumping of Japanese semiconductors in the U.S. market. 
                Nakasone is still seen as America's key ally in seeking the desired 
                political, security and economic objectives in Japan, so the meeting 
                is intended to bolster the Prime Minister for his struggles with 
                the Diet, while making clear the need for more effective actions 
                by Japan to meet U.S. concerns if this vital relationship is to 
                continue. </p>

                Visit, January 12-15, 1988; c. January 1988</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>This detailed memorandum prepared for Secretary of State Shultz's 
                participation in meetings with visiting new Japanese Prime Minister 
                Takeshita shows, as the Reagan administration neared its end, 
                that the record of accomplishments with Japan remained mixed. 
                While under former Prime Minister Nakasone Japan had been a strong 
                backer of U.S. security objectives, the pace of desired change 
                and reform in the economic and trade spheres had remained slow 
                and unsteady. Structural reform of the Japanese economy still 
                lagged, while trade issues continued to fester. The U.S. felt 
                it held a strong hand, based on the assumption that Takeshita, 
                as other prime ministers, needed to show he could successfully 
                manage U.S.-Japan relations in order to secure his political future. 
                The memorandum goes on to itemize the lengthy list of issues facing 
                Reagan and Takeshita in their talks.</p>

                11. Talking Points (S), The President's July 8th Meeting with 
                Prime Minister Kaifu, c. July 8, 1990</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>These talking points outline the major issues surrounding President 
                Bush and Prime Minister Kaifu's meeting prior to the G-7 meeting, 
                so economic and financial subjects take prominence. Compared to 
                earlier such memoranda, this one paints a relatively rosier picture 
                of the state of U.S.-Japan economic and trade relations, based 
                on the perceived success of the Structural Impediments Initiative 
                that targeted areas for reform in each nation's economic and financial 
                policies. Perhaps basking in the positive glow of the fall of 
                the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern 
                Europe, the hope is expressed that the two countries can build 
                on these steps to work in partnership on a range of global economic 
                issues, as well as on issues of joint concern, such as promoting 
                political and economic reform in China. A new issue that appears 
                on the agenda that will explode in importance a decade later is 
                tackling terrorism</p>

                GOJ Contributions and Gulf Crisis, January 16, 1991</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>A half year after Bush and Kaifu met to discuss possible new 
                avenues for global cooperation in the post-Cold War era, the U.S.-Japan 
                relationship finds itself once more defined in terms of defense 
                and security issues in the wake of the first Gulf Crisis with 
                Saddam Hussein's Iraq. This cable reports on U.S. Ambassador Armacost's 
                talks with the Japanese government about securing a significant 
                contribution from Japan towards meeting the Gulf Crisis, with 
                Armacost expressing the hope that Japan would find a way to share 
                both the risks as well as the financial costs. Securing either 
                would prove to be a challenging problem.</p>

                14, 1991</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>In this cable Ambassador Armacost provides his sober assessment 
                of Japan's response to the challenges posed by the first Gulf 
                Crisis. Stressing Japan's essentially &quot;passive&quot; approach 
                to the Gulf War, the debate over Japan's post-Cold War role in 
                the world, and the still unanswered question of whether Japan's 
                political and bureaucratic system can handle new challenges, Armacost 
                rates Japan's response as &quot;not unsuccessful by the standards 
                of Japan's foreign policy of the last forty five years&quot; - 
                not exactly a ringing endorsement. He feels the crisis did serve 
                to highlight the obstacles to a mature Japanese foreign policy, 
                as well as the inadequacy of limiting Japan's role to sending 
                money without taking on the risks and responsibilities associated 
                with being a great power.</p>

                14. Cable (S), Secretary of State Baker to Department of Defense, 
                Subject: Dealing with the North Korean Nuclear Problem: Impressions 
                from My Asia Trip, November 18, 1991</a></strong></font></p>
              <p>This cable provides Secretary of State Baker's views on the positions 
                being taken in Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo on dealing with the problem 
                of the DPRK nuclear program. It is marked by a clear sense of 
                the interplay of different perspectives and concerns motivating 
                the three governments. The delicate nature of this diplomatic 
                maneuvering was made clear in Baker's report that South Korean 
                President Roh's national security advisor had spelled out that 
                Koreans did not want Japan or Russia involved in the politics 
                of the Korean peninsula. The South Koreans acknowledged that Japan 
                had important economic leverage on the North that should be used 
                effectively in bringing Pyongyang to the bargaining table, but 
                Baker noted that the South Koreans' &quot;own bitter history with 
                the Japanese will inhibit policy coordination.&quot; Tokyo's position, 
                for its part, seems to Baker to be hardening and moving closer 
                to the U.S. with regard to the commitments Pyongyang had to make 
                before normalization of relations and economic aid could be provided 
                to North Korea.</p>
